One of the greatest mysteries in American military history will be solved next month, when Fox News will air an interview with the Nacy SEAL who shot dead Osama Bin Laden. 

The identity of the SEAL Team 6 member called 'The Shooter' was fiercely guarded in the aftermath of the May 2011 raid on Bin Laden's Abbottabad, Pakisatan compound, fearing the SEAL could be targeted by al-Qaeda as retribution. 

But he has since retired and is apparently ready to take off his mask of anonymity to details the events leading up to and during Operation Neptune's Spear. 

According to a Fox News press release, the two-part special The Man Who Killed Usama Bin Laden will air Tuesday November 11 and Wednesday November 12 from 10-11pm ET. The interview will be conducted by Washington Correspondent Peter Doocy.

'Revealing his identity and speaking out publicly for the first time, the Navy SEAL, also known as “The Shooter,” will share his story of training to be a member of America’s elite fighting force and explain his involvement in Operation Neptune Spear, the mission that killed Bin Laden,' the press release states. 

'The documentary will provide an extensive, first-hand account of the mission, including the unexpected crash of one of the helicopters that night and why SEAL Team 6 feared for their lives. It will also touch upon what was taking place inside the terrorist compound while President Obama and his cabinet watched from the White House.' 

It's unclear whether the Shooter's identity will be protected in anyway, or if he will both appear on the camera and reveal his real name. 

9/11 mastermind Osama Bin Laden was shot dead at his Abbottabad, Pakistan compound in May 2011

Fox says he will also share what it was like to confront Bin Laden and what happened when the terrorist took his final breath. 

Also included in the special will be footage of the ceremony in which the Shooter donated the shirt he wore during the raid to the National September 11 Memorial Museum earlier this year. 

While the shooter's identity has remained a secret in the three year's since Bin Laden's assassination, a few details have emerged about his life from an interview he gave to Esquire magazine last year.  

Now retired, it was revealed the special-forces solider has suffered a breakdown in his marriage and is so concerned about being identified that he refused to meet families of 9/11 victims to preserve his anonymity, said the New York Post.

In an interview with Esquire magazine in February 2013, the shooter described in extraordinary detail the heart-stopping two minutes that changed the course of history.

In the Esquire interview The Shooter reveals that once they were given their mission, the female CIA agent - portrayed by Jessica Chastain's Maya in Zero Dark Thirty - told the team that bin Laden was '100 per cent on the third floor' of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

'We got him,' she told us. 'This is him. This is my life's work. I'm positive.'

Once he locked eyes on his target, the SEAL remembers being surprised at his appearance. Bin Laden was much taller than he expected him to be - taller than any of their guys, and skinny with a short beard and shaved head.

He was holding his wife Amal in front of him as a shield and though The Shooter could see exactly what was going on through night vision goggles, bin Laden was in total darkness and could hear but not see. 

Hearts in mouth: President Obama, with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and vice president Joe Biden, watched the raid unfold in front of their eyes back in Washington D.C.

He also said he feared she might try to blow them up. He added: ‘I don’t know if she’s got a vest and she’s being pushed to martyr them both.

'I'm just looking at him from right here [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for. And he's moving forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow himself up].

'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place.

'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath.

'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**.

'His forehead was gruesome. It was split open in the shape of a V. I could see his brains spilling out over his face.'

The Shooter also says that the night before the raid, all the members of Team Six wrote letters to their loved ones - fully believing they would die in the mission to take down bin Laden.

He described how he sat on his bed writing a letter to his kids to be delivered on the case of his death, 'something for them to read when they are 35'.
