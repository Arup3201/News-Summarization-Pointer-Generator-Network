An abandoned dog with two bowed front legs has taken his first steps after an animal lover drove him more than 2,000 miles for surgery.

Sandy the German Shepherd, dubbed 'wonky', was discovered unable to walk after being dumped by his owners on the Greek island of Corfu two months ago.

He had been left abandoned in a malnourished state - causing him to develop severely deformed legs.

Walkies: Sandy was discovered unable to walk after being abandoned by his owners on the Greek island of Corfu two months ago.  He has now taken his first steps after Pat Clark (right) drove him to England for surgery

Recovering: Following his arrival in Britain, vets offered to operate on Sandy (pictured with Ms Clark) for free

But he was given a chance of a new life after Pat Clark raised funds to drive him more than 2,000 miles to Cambridge in England, where vets offered to operate on him free of charge.

Now, following two successful operations, Sandy can stand up, walk and run for the first time.

Ms Clark, 55, who will adopt the dog once he has fully recovered, said he was still undergoing physiotherapy and hydrotherapy at Companion Care Vets at the Beehive Centre.

'We are one million percent happy with how the surgery has gone,' she said. 'The vets have done an amazing job. 

'Wonky': Sandy had been dumped by owners in a malnourished state - causing him to develop deformed legs

Saved: The dog, pictured before his operations, is still undergoing courses in physiotherapy and hydrotherapy

Deformed: The extent of Sandy's deformity - believed to have been caused by malnutrition - is shown on X-Ray

'When we first brought him over from Greece, he stayed with us over Christmas and as a result he learnt his way around. He became a part of the family and parting with him now would be completely out of the question.'

Vet Chaim Pilosof, who carried out Â£2,000 worth of operations on Sandy's legs for free, said he was optimistic that the dog's recovery would be successful.

'The second operation was more 
complicated due to fact that both front legs were deformed but slightly 
in different way, which made the repair of the left leg trickier, and a 
tendon was compromised as a result,' he said.

Unknown: Vets at Companion Care Vets are still none-the-wiser as to how Sandy's bowed legs came about

Loved: Ms Clark said Sandy quickly became a part of her family - and that she could not part with him now

'The rehabilitation is taking longer due to complication with infection (which is now good under control) and the damage to the tendon.'

Despite having successfully completed both operations, vets are still none-the-wiser as to how the bowed legs came about.

'We believe Sandy's condition developed 
due to nutritional deficiencies, but we do not have a proof one way or 
another,' said Mr Pilosof.

Complications: Mr Pilosof said the dog's rehabilitation was taking a while 'due to complication with infection'

Difference: Sandy's right front leg, which is now straight following the two operations

Stark contrast: The dog's front legs appear almost perfectly straight on X-Ray

'It is impossible to say why his legs came short when he was a puppy.'

Since Sandy arrived in the country, numerous donations have been made to Ms Clarks's Essex-based charity, Mutts in Distress.

These have enabled the charity to fund metal plates to straighten Sandy's legs, which normally cost Â£200, as well as a dog bed.

Heading home: Since Sandy arrived in the country, numerous donations have been made to Ms Clarks's Essex-based charity, Mutts in Distress. Above, the dog is pictured recovering with vets

'Sandy hasn't had any more material donations since the bed and plates were given to us,' said Ms Clark.

'However, we have had cash donations from all around the world, as far afield as China, Canada and America.

'These have been invaluable as we might have to pay for an MRI scan for Sandy as he might be blind.'

Following his recovery, Sandy will join the charity's 12 other dogs at its rescue centre in Bishops Stortford, Essex.
