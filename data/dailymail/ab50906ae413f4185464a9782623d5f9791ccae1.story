Ronny Deila is in the mood for a Celtic Park party — after challenging his players to prove they belong in the Champions League.

Celtic stand just one strong performance away from reaching the group stages of Europe’s elite club competition, as they take a 1-1 away draw into the return leg of Tuesday's play-off with NK Maribor.

Delia knows the reprieve Celtic were handed after being trounced by Legia Warsaw in the previous qualifying round, with Scotland’s champions awarded a 3-0 home win after the Poles fielded an ineligible player as a late substitute, has caused some to question whether they deserve this crack at the big time.

But he insists that seeing off their Slovenian opponents will silence all doubters – and send him into a festive season frenzy before August is out.

‘It is Christmas Day and Happy New Year at the same time, if we can do it,’ said Deila. ‘It would be fantastic, it’s my dream to do it, to coach a team in the biggest tournament in football, at the highest level. I get goose bumps when I think of it, it’s fantastic. I’m really looking forward to it.

‘Of course it is the most important night of this season. The biggest. I can’t wait.

‘It’s been a long 10 weeks of hard work, ups and downs. Now we’re here at the final moment, the moment of decision. We have to go out and attack the game.

‘If we go through, we will have shown we belong in the Champions League – because we’ve been good enough to qualify. That is the main thing.

‘I’ll say it again, Legia Warsaw were a better team than us. But things happened and now we have an opportunity in the play-off. Maribor is there and, if we beat them, we have shown we can be in the Champions League. If we don’t beat them then we say: “Okay, we’re not good enough.”

Final task: A win against Maribor on Tuesday night at Celtic Park would seal Champions League qualification

‘That’s where we are now. But let’s give everything and see where it takes us. We can look on this night and see where we are.

‘If we can qualify it wouldn’t mean any less to us because of what happened with Legia Warsaw. As I have said before, it was out of our hands. We got another opportunity to prove we are good enough.’

Deila insisted that pending deals to bring in Wakaso Mubarak and – most probably – Stefan Scepovic were not dependent on securing a spot in the world’s most lucrative club competition.

‘Transfers happen step by step,’ he said. ‘I am comfortable with what I have going into this game. I look at the players and the atmosphere with the group is good. They are the ones who have to do it and I really believe in them.’

That said, progression tonight may hold the key to whether Celtic can retain Virgil van Dijk.

Sevilla are back in the hunt for the Dutch centre-half after having agreed a deal to sell central defender Federico Fazio to Spurs for around £8million.

Their first-choice replacement is Juventus and Italy stopper Angelo Ogbonna but negotiations on a fee have stalled as the Italian champions want in excess of £13m.

With the transfer window closing on Monday, they have had to look closely at alternatives and sources in Spain have placed van Dijk high up on the list.

Much, of course, could depend on the outcome of tonight’s match. Should Celtic not make it past the Slovenian champions, there will be a temptation to cash in on van Dijk, a player they value at more than £6m.

While Celtic continue to work at bringing players in, striker Amido Balde was last night the subject of a loan offer from former club Vitoria Guimares – clearing more space in the squad for a new front man.
