Dropped charges: George Zimmerman's girlfriend has dropped charges against him just weeks after she claimed the volatile man, pictured in July, pointed a shotgun at her and smashed her stuff, and now she even wants him back

George Zimmerman's girlfriend has dropped charges against him just weeks after she claimed he pointed a shotgun at her and smashed her stuff, and now she even wants him back, it has emerged.

Samantha Scheibe called 911 in November, telling operators Zimmerman was brandishing a weapon during an argument and that she feared for her life. He was charged with felony aggravated assault among other lesser charges.

But he is now asking to have conditions of his bail modified so he can resume contact with Scheibe, who, according to court documents filed by Zimmerman's attorney, gave a sworn statement that read: 'I do not want George Zimmerman charged.'

Zimmerman, 30, had been barred from seeing or contacting the 27-year-old blonde after he posted $9,000 bond. He was also forced to give up his guns and wear a GPS monitor.

According to ABC News, Scheibe says in a new affidavit, dated December 6, 'When I was being questioned by police I felt very intimidated...I believe that the police misinterpreted me and that I may have misspoken about certain facts in my statement to police.'

Scheibe goes on to say in the statement that Zimmerman 'never pointed a gun at or toward my face in a threatening manner' and that she wants 'to be with George' and is 'not afraid of George in any manner.'

Then she wrote: 'I make this decision freely, knowingly and voluntarily, and without coercion'

Zimmerman's attorney Jayne Weintraub claims Scheibe reached out to her and asked that the order barring contact between the pair be lifted so they could rekindle their love.

However, the new affidavit gives a starkly different account of events to Scheibe's original 911 call.

On the day of the argument, she 
called the emergency line and clearly told a dispatcher Zimmerman was 
brandished a weapon at her, had smashed her glass table with it and then locked her out of her home.

'He's
in my house, breaking all my s--- because I asked him to leave,' 
Scheibe told the operator. 'He's got a freaking gun, breaking all my 
stuff right now.'

She is also heard screaming at Zimmerman: 'You put your gun in my freakin' face... Get out of my house. Do not push me out of my house. Please get out of my house.'

Chris White, lead prosecutor in Seminole County, told the Orlando Sentinel Monday that his office would evaluate Scheibe's affidavit and decide later this week whether to push forward with or abandon the domestic violence case.

After the
November incident, Scheibe opened up about the couple's volatile relationship in an 
interview where she detailed Zimmerman's intense depression since he was acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin.

Samantha Scheibe reportedly told Zimmerman she was six weeks pregnant but he told her he was leaving

Argument: Zimmerman, pictured leaving jail, may or may not have pointed a shotgun at his girlfriend who had been feeling increasingly scared of him

However, in late November, sources close to 
Zimmerman claimed Scheibe had made up the incident after allegedly 
faking a pregnancy in a failed bid to stop him leaving her.

Zimmerman was ordered to
stay 1,500 feet away from Scheibe at all times and hand over his array of 
guns after she claimed he threatened her and forced her out of their home.

TMZ reported last month that Scheibe told him she was six weeks pregnant after he made it clear he was 
leaving her and leaving Florida for Texas.

Zimmerman
reportedly offered to make a child custody and support deal, but what 
Scheibe really wanted was for them to stay together.

When she saw Zimmerman packing his bags, the sources claim she decided to make up the story of him pointing the gun at her as 
revenge.

Zimmerman began datingÂ Scheibe after she apparently consoled him following his break up with wife, Shellie.

After
Shellie filed for divorce, Zimmerman moved into Scheibe's Seminole 
County home but, according to her, their relationship soon fell apart 
because of his depression.

In an interview, she said she helped him after he spiraled into a very dark place and tried
to kill himself multiple times, once putting a gun in his mouth and 
threatening to pull the trigger.

In
late October, she demanded he get professional help but she said this 
made him angry and he moved all her furniture, clothes and food out of 
her home.

They later made up and he moved her things back into the house. But the relationship remained 
volatile and on one occasion soon after, Scheibe sought refuge at her 
mother Hope Mason's house to get away from Zimmerman.

While
there, Mason told ClickOrlando that Zimmerman sent Scheibe's daughter a
still image from an intimate home video of Scheibe and Zimmerman.

'He's now threatened her in writing and even sent a portion of the video to her baby girl,' Mason wrote in a text.

Despite this, the couple reunited again.
But on November 18, a terrified Scheibe called 911 for help, telling the 
operator Zimmerman put his gun in her face and was smashing up her 
furniture.

In cuffs again: George Zimmerman appeared in court earlier in November on charges including aggravated assault stemming from the November 19 fight

He was charged with aggravated 
assault, ordered to keep his distance and also hand over his firearms.

In messages to ClickOrlando, Scheibe said Zimmerman changed as soon as he was acquitted in the Trayvon Martin case.

She
said he spiraled into a very deep depression after the media frenzy 
went away and while he was prescribed medication, after a while he 
stopped taking it.

Scheibe described how he spent days in bed, refusing to get up.

One day she found him passed out with an empty bottle of sleeping pills on his sidetable. She claims he overdosed and she wasn't able to revive him but noticed he was still breathing.

When he did wake, she said he started crying and then put a gun inside his mouth, telling her he was ready to end it all. She said she talked him out of killing himself.

But this wasn't the only occasion he threatened to take his own life, she said.

According to Scheibe, Zimmerman enjoyed the media attention he received from the Trayvon case and grew depressed when he wasn't in the headlines.
