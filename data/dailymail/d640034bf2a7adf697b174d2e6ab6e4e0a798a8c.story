Arsenal want their move for Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez finalised by the start of next week.

The Chile star's representatives are expected to arrive in London to hold talks with Gunners officials in the coming days.

Sanchez is set to be offered a similar wage as current top earner Mesut Ozil, who earns £140,000-per-week.

Forward thinking: Arsenal are hoping to complete the signing of Sanchez by the start of next week

Initial discussions with Sanchez's advisers have already taken place, while discussions with Barca chiefs are also well underway.

Arsenal are confident they can match the 25-year-old's wage demands and will meet Barca's £30million valuation, leaving them hopeful of bringing their move for the star, who has indicated he is willing to move to Arsenal, to a swift conclusion.

Juventus want to hijack the Gunners' move for Sanchez, who has already played in Serie A with Udinese.

However, there are serious doubts emerging over the Turin club's ability to fund a move for the South American forward.

Likewise, Liverpool are keen to take Sanchez as part of Luis Suarez's switch to Catalonia - but the forward has indicated he has no interest in moving to Anfield.

All that leaves Arsenal with a clear run at landing Sanchez, and there is a growing confidence at the Emirates Stadium that Sanchez will become the club's marquee signing.

Meanwhile, Mathieu Debuchy is on the brink of completing an £11m switch to Arsenal from Premier League rivals Newcastle after undergoing a medical.

Arsenal's move for Debuchy follows the departure of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City on a free transfer.

Debuchy was preferred to Sagna in the France starting line-up throughout the World Cup.

The 28-year-old made 46 appearances for Newcastle, scoring just once - against arch-rivals Sunderland.

He moved to St James' Park from Lille for £5.5m in January 2013.

Newcastle are looking at Manchester City's Micah Richards and Arsenal's Carl Jenkinson as replacements.
