A 24-year-old Reddit user got the shock of her life on Wednesday when she discovered that the Secret Santa gift she’d just received via the website’s annual exchange was from none other than Bill Gates.

Rachel, the lucky recipient of the Not-So-Secret Santa present from the world’s richest person, received a $40 travel book, a $25 stuffed cow along with an undisclosed donation to the non-profit Heifer International.

When Rachel first found a card along with her gifts explaining who it was from, she admits her initial reaction was that someone was playing an elaborate prank on her until she found an attached photo of the Microsoft founder holding her gifts.

Not-So-Secret Santa: To prove it was really him, Gates included this photo with the presents he sent to Rachel

‘My god. Never in my entire life did I imagine, ever, ever, ever that Bill would get me,’ wrote Rachel in a Reddit post revealing her highly usual Secret Santa experience.

Rachel posts on the social media site under the username NY1227 and describes herself as someone who ‘love nails and makeup! I also love to travel, particularly to the Caribbean and Europe.’

On Monday she received an email informing her that her gift - which weighted a whooping seven pounds - was being shipped to her overnight.

It wasn’t until Wednesday that Rachel had time to open her gift, but she was so excited to see what was in it that she decided to document the opening of the present by talking photographs of the contents.

Rachel also received this note explaining the significance of her present - a stuffed cow

‘The first thing I noticed was a stuffed animal. I didn't know I gave off the stuffed animal vibe, but I excitedly added him to my collection of teddy bears and other delightful friendly creatures,’ she wrote.

Next she found an envelope which read ‘To me, from Bill’.

‘I thought Bill sounded like a friendly fellow. In fact, I had this whole image of this poor guy named Bill trying to navigate my wishlist full of makeup, nailpolish, glittery things to buy me,’ wrote Rachel.

‘Quite frankly I felt bad for this Bill since I'm a self-identified pain in the ass to shop for.’Inside envelop was a note informing Rachel that Bill had donated to Heifer International, a nonprofit seeking to end poverty and hunger, in her honor.

‘I took a break from my present to research the charity a bit, and now the stuffed animal cow made sense,’ wrote Rachel, ‘I was so excited, the cause seemed really worthy and amazing, and it is the season of giving.’

The final part of her present, also the largest, was a large travel book called Journeys Of A Lifetime, no doubt inspired by her posts about liking travel.

Inside the book was also a note explaining her presents and which was signed Bill Gates.

As it dawned on Rachel who her Secret Santa was, she was also suspicious that it might be an elaborate hoax until she spotted a photograph of Gates holding her stuffed toy and the note that she had just read.

‘I feel SO shocked and excited that not only did I receive a gift from Bill, but it was perfectly and EXACTLY tuned into my interests. My gosh, what a rush!!’ she wrote.

In her Reddit post explaining the whole incident, Rachel thanked Gates for ‘an amazing gift and Secret Santa experience.’

‘Bill- you ROCK (can I call you Bill?! I feel like we're friends now!),' she write. 'I am so very, very grateful for the amazing and thoughtful gift you have picked for me!’

Rachel also ended her Reddit post with an apology to Gates: 'ps: Sorry for the apple ipad on my wishlist, that was really awkward.'

It isn’t clear how much Gates, the world's richest person in 2013 according to Bloomberg Billionaires List, donated to Heifer International, but Rachel speculated, ‘I can only imagine it was QUITE a bit.’

The charity gives livestock, seeds and trees and extensive
training to those in need and has helped more than 79 million people in more
than 125 countries.

Microsoft founder Gates is well-known for his philanthropy work and his charity the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest private foundation in the world.

Inside the envelope was a short note explaining that Bill had made a donation to the charity Heifer International on behalf of Rachel

Gates participation in the Secret Santa was an attempt to help bring attention to Heifer International, reports GeekWire.

This isn't the first time that Gates has 
participated in the Reddit community, he previously took part in an 
Ask Me Anything in February.
