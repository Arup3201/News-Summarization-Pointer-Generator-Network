A flea-infested rabbit who was found dumped in a cardboard box after his owner's benefits had allegedly been cut could now have an incurable disease - even though it would have cost just £20 to prevent it.

The abandoned bunny was dumped among a pile of rubbish and old clothes near Queen's Park tube, north London, in a box which said 'My owner’s benefit has been cut'.

The five-year-old straggly rabbit had horribly-matted fur, a bad infection in his floppy ears and was in such a bad state that the finder thought he was a guinea pig. 

The pet rabbit, Kieren, was found dumped in a cardboard box near Queen's Park tube, north London

The box, found among a pile of old clothes and rubbish, said: 'Please help me, I'm 5yrs (My owner benefit has been cut)'

The flea-infested rabbit had matted fur and a bad infection in his ears when he was found earlier this week. It is now feared Kieren could have myxomatosis - an incurable but preventable condition spread by fleas

He also had overgrown nails measuring at least two inches - described by an animal welfare worker as the longest rabbit nails she had ever seen.

But there are now fears the little bunny could have myxomatosis, an incurable but preventable disease spread by fleas.

Gillian Notton, the animal welfare worker at Mayhew Animal Home, where Kieren was taken for treatment, said an annual flea 
vaccination - which could have prevented his condition - costs around £20.

A parasite treatment, which can be given every three months to rabbits prone to fleas, is just £8.

But once a rabbit has contracted the condition, it is unlikely they will survive longer than 14 days.

She
 said: 'I have never seen nails as bad. They were at least two inches 
long and were curling around.

Kieren's nails were at least two inches long, meaning he had not been living in the right environment. If he was, the nails would have been worn down, an animal welfare expert said

'It shows he was not in the right 
environment because his nails were just not being worn down.'

Hay bale used for food and bedding - £2 per week

Pellets used for food - around £5 per week

Annual flea vaccination - £20

Emergency parasite treatment - £8

Ms Notton said Kieren had been eating and moving around since being treated at the centre but was now undergoing treatment for his puffy eyes - a sign of the deadly disease.

She said: 'Kieren is eating and moving around, but we now believe he has myxomatosis.

'He is having treatment for his eyes but, if it is what we think it is, he will not have a very good prognosis.

'It's just frustrating because everything Kieren has is preventable.

'A rabbit does not cost much to treat and there are many charitable organisations which would help someone on benefits if they couldn't afford to give them the right vaccinations.

'When he was found, the woman thought it might have been a guinea pig because of the way he looked.'

Ms Notton said rabbits mainly feast on hay which can be bought for just a few pounds from a pet shop.

She said that, along with a bag of pellets costing around £10, would feed a normal-sized rabbit for a few weeks.

Samantha Saunders, a vet at the centre, said: 'The frustrating thing about cases like poor Kieren is that there are many outlets out there that are available that offers low cost preventative measures and his suffering could have easily been avoided.'

If Kieren becomes well enough to leave the survery, the vet will look for a new home for the little bunny.
