If self-restraint and portion control isn't your thing, a craving-quencher hailed as the ultimate snack substitiue might soon be hitting shelves.

One inventor has come up with the Listerine Strip-type product called Cravings, which tastes of delicious milk chocolate but contains no sugar and absolutely no calories.

'Every pack has 24 strips; you pull one strip and let it dissolve in your mouth for a blast of flavour,' says founder Ian Goldfarb of his Kickstarter project.

'It's not a new technology, edible film has been around a long time, but we will be repurposing it using flavors we crave. This is where the fun begins.'

So when you get ravenous for a Mars bar but don't want to counteract those miles pounding the treadmill, you can simply put the dissolvable, edible film on the 
roof of your mouth and savour the flavour instead.

Your body will be 
tricked into thinking it has had what it asked for, and you can avoid 
piling on those pounds.

A pack has 24 strips and is set to retail for less than £6, with a bundle of three packs coming in at less than £15.

The makers claim it will help dieters satisfy their chocolate cravings without any guilt and could soon be a reality if Goldfarb secures his pledge of almost £24,000. The Willy Wonka-type inventor needs to multiply his current pledge of £2,650 almost tenfold in less than 24 hours.

He was inspired by his own inability to say no to snacks.

'For years I've been following the standard regiments of working out and watching what I eat, but I've always felt like something was missing. I constantly get cravings that lead to binge eating sessions... and then I counteract a full week of healthy diet and exercise,' he says.

'Easy things like switching to diet sodas and removing breads were a good start. By limiting the types of food I ate, I found a way to control my calorie intake. Still, I did not have a way to suppress my cravings for chocolate, breads, ice cream, etc.

'I discovered a possible solution some years ago in Listerine Strips. It's an edible film flavored for consumers.

'After doing some research, I discovered that adding flavors to this edible film is a relatively simple process, and there are several flavor development companies. I also discovered that it is possible to create zero calorie edible film with the flavors of sweets, meats, breads, salty snacks, or anything we desire.'

'After selecting our medium for craving suppression the next step was to decide the flavour,' he says.

'This was a fun but overall painful process to narrow down the selection of tasty flavors. Research doesn’t lie, and in the end, chocolate was the winner.'
