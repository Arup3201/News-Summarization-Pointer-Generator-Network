Condoleezza Rice has revealed she once threatened to resign and often argued with Dick Cheney over how to deal with captured terror suspects.

The former secretary of state has revealed George W. Bush’s presidential team often seriously fell out over how to protect the U.S. after 9/11.

A new book reveals she was against ex-vice president Mr Cheney’s forceful approach and told him terror suspects could not be ‘disappeared’.

Her resignation threat came in November 2001 - when she found out Mr Bush had signed off military commands without her knowing, she wrote.

But the order had been written by White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. She said it was not Mr Bush’s fault - and the president apologised to her.

The revelations come in her new book ‘No Higher Honor’, which has been viewed by the New York Times ahead of its publication next month.

Her book features flashbacks on how the U.S. tried to revolutionise its security after 9/11 and the terror fears that followed those attacks.

Ms Rice writes about scares soon after 9/11 over potential smallpox and radioactive attacks on Washington - which were not revealed back then.

'So what’s your plan, Condi? We’ll just let them kill each other, and we’ll stand by and
try to pick up the pieces?'

She clashed with Mr Bush five years ago 
over his idea of sending more troops to Iraq because she wanted to 
remove U.S. forces from the country, reported the New York Times.

‘So what’s your plan, Condi?’ she said he asked him. ‘We’ll just let them kill each other, and we’ll stand by and try to pick up the pieces?’

Months earlier they clashed over moving alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to Guantanamo Bay, reported the New York Times.

Book: No Higher Honor by Condoleezza Rice is due for release next month

Mr Bush eventually agreed with Ms Rice 
that Mohammed should be moved there along with other terror suspects.

She wrote ex-secretary of state Colin Powell said ‘one of us needs to go’ in reference to ex-defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, before he left himself.

Ms Rice claimed Mr Rumsfeld once told her ‘I don’t do detainees’ and said that his relationship with her ‘just doesn’t work’.

In addition she writes about last-minute nuclear negotiations with India and almost reaching a peace deal between Israel and Palestine, 
reported the New York Times.

She added Colonel Gaddafi had an ‘eerie fascination’ with her and bizarrely made a video with pictures of her and a song called ‘Black Flower in the White House’.

She also claims Lebanon President Emile Lahoud needed a shower.
