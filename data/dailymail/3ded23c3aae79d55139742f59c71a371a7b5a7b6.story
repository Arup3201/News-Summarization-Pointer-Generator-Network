West Ham made it an Italian double on Saturday as they signed Marco Borriello and Antonio Nocerino on loan until the end of the season.

Both Italy internationals, Borriello has swapped Roma for a Premier League survival scrap, while Nocerino has traded AC Milan for the east end.

Seven-cap Borriello, 31, is a striker with close to a hundred career goals to his name, accrued at the likes of Milan, Juventus, Genoa and Roma.

Swoop: Antonio Nocerino completed a loan move to West Ham from AC Milan

Happy Hammer: Marco Boriello also joined on loan from Roma, lending a much-needed striking option

Double swoop: West Ham have brought in Nocerino and wait on a deal for Marco Borriello

He joined the capital club in the 
summer of 2010 amid rumours of interest from Manchester City, while he 
won the title with Juventus during a 2012 loan spell.

A statement on Roma's website read: 'A.S Roma announces that it has signed with West Ham United FC, the contract for the temporary transfer of rights to the player Borriello, until 30 June2014, for a consideration of € 0.7 million (£580k)'

His signing was announced after that of Nocerino.

Nocerino,
 28, has also been drafted in to help the Hammers in their battle to 
earn Premier League survival, with Sam Allardyce's men currently in the 
relegation zone.

Capped 15 times by Italy, Nocerino is known to English fans for scoring a penalty against England at Euro 2012.

The
 ex-Juventus and Palermo man has been a bit-part player this season 
having previously been a key man for the club he joined in the summer of
 2011.

The duo's arrival was
 announced on West Ham's official website the day after Leeds confirmed 
they had turned down an offer from the Hammers for leading scorer Ross 
McCormack.
