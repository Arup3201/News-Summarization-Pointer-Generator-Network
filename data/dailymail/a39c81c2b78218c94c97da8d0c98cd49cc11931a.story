Most people undertake a total life overhaul after some kind of dramatic event such as a near-death experience or the birth of a child. 

However one woman  transformed herself by creating a bucket list, simply because her life 'sucked'.

Fed-up Laura Lawson, 26, from Portlethen, Aberdeenshire, decided to change her life because she didn't want to be lying on her deathbed full of regrets.

Laura was 'fat, sad and lonely' and would comfort eat and drink every weekend (left) but now (right) has lost an 3st 2lb through carrying out all her sporty challenges around the world and improving her diet

Laura set herself the task to totally transform her life, completing numerous challenges such as sky diving

A major change in her life has been her marriage to husband David, 29, in Las Vegas last September

Laura's inventive bucket list has included para sailing (left) and a helicopter ride (right)

'I was 23 years old and wasting my life away, and at 14st I didn't even recognise my own reflection,' she said.

'The last five years were spent drinking every weekend, eating anything I could get my hands on and spending every evening locked in my room playing the Xbox.

'I tried to figure what had happened to me. Blaming everything on everyone else. My work sucked, my life sucked, I was fat, sad, lonely.

Determined to change, she made a New Year's resolution in 2012 to get out of her rut.

Since then she has got married, bought a house, lost weight - and completed 120 exciting challenges which have taken her around the world, helped her lose 3st 2lb in weight and seen her get married.

She has also managed to get a qualification and change her career, securing work as a buyer in the oil and gas industry.

One of the challenges Laura undertook was to feed a rhino (pictured), which she did at San Diego zoo

Laura set out to try new experiences, like using a jet pack (pictured) as she didn't  want to live with regrets

Laura has experienced hair-raising rides (left) and shooting (right), and will be travelling to Mexico and California next where she plans to swim with sharks 

She said: 'I came up with every excuse until I realised only I could change my life. Sitting feeling sorry for myself wasn't doing any good.' 

The former administration worker wrote down a list and started off small by climbing a hill, dyeing her hair pink and growing vegetables.

And the satisfaction she gained from crossing off every activity inspired the idea for a bucket list.

She kicked off the challenge with a bungee jump.

Laura has even managed to take her husband David, 29,  - who she married in Las Vegas last September - on the journey with her. 

Laura, pictured snorkeling on one of her challenges, says she is much happier now 

She said: 'I met him before I started this and he has been dragged along on everything. I think he thinks I am trying to kill him with all the things I do.

'I think he got a bit of a fright at first but now he is glad he is joining in.'

Laura has lost an impressive 3st 2lb through carrying out all her sporty challenges and eating more healthily.

She even bought her wedding dress three sizes smaller to encourage herself to slim down for her big day last year.

Laura said she is much happier now and glad that her life has changed.

She said: 'The thought of being on my deathbed having spent my whole life like I had been scared me, and I wanted no regrets.

'I don't drink any more. I think about better things to spend my money on and don't want to spend weekends with a hangover.

'I've lost a lot of weight and I've met new friends.'

This year, Laura is heading to Mexico and California to cross more off the list. She plans to swim with sharks, go in a submarine, visit a nudist beach and go horse riding.

She has completed 120 of her 300 challenges so far, including a bungee jump and parasail and has flown in a helicopter, fed a rhino and stroked a baby lion.
