The Florida socialite at the centre of the sex scandal that brought down former CIA director David Petraeus has waded into the NSA spy row claiming the FBI 'illegally' snooped through her and her husband's emails.

Jill Kelley went to the FBI after receiving threatening emails from Petraeus's mistress Paula Broadwell warning her off her lover.

The subsequent investigation led to Petraeus's affair being exposed and forcing his resignation as CIA director.

General John Allen, the top US 
commander in Afghanistan, became ensnared in the scandal after it was 
revealed he sent thousands of emails to Kelley.

Kelley, 38, who sued the FBI and 
Department of Defense in June for leaking her name to the media, claims 
she authorised investigators to look at just one of the threatening 
emails in the hope they would identify the stalker.

But she claims that in a flagrant breach of trust, the FBI ignored her 
request and unlawfully scoured through and her and her husband Scott's private 
emails without revealing who had been sending the messages.

Kelley claims the FBI then turned her and her husband into targets of an
'intrusive' investigation , leaking their identities to the media and 
distorting the contents of the emails they had illegaly.

Writing in the Wall Street Journal she said: 'As a result of the 
government's breach of our privacy and trust, camera crews showed up at 
our door and camped outside our home to question us about false and 
misleading information leaked to the media from 'unnamed' government 
sources.

'Reckless speculation and innuendo about an inappropriate relationship 
with Gen. Allen spread throughout the news media, sullying my reputation
and honor, to the great distress of my family. To this day the 
government has not apologized for its indefensible conduct.

'I hope that my family's story is a case study about the damage that can be caused by the government's electronic overreach.'

In the wake of the NSA spying row, Kelley believes her case is an 
example of how Government agencies are over stepping the mark and 
potentialy acting illegally.

She added: 'I hope that my family's story is a case study about the 
damage that can be caused by the government's electronic overreach.

'It appears from the NSA's leaks that the government may be trying to 
collect everything about everyone and everywhere—including America's 
closest friends and allies—with or without the knowledge of the White 
House.

'Unaccountable individuals given free rein to invade people's 
privacy—and a government that maintains the tools that permit them to do
so—are a prescription for a privacy disaster.'

Speaking in June after suing the FBI  
and Department of Defense Kelley said her involvement in the scandal 'shook my life' and 'changed our country's leadership'.

She added: 'It was under the faithful
direction of our concerned military leaders that I went to the law 
enforcement to seek the proper protection for my family, our commanders,
and top U.S. officials.

'But, unfortunately, we did not 
receive the confidentiality and protection. Instead we received highly 
hurtful and damaging publicity from willful leaks from high level 
government officials that were false and defamatory.'

The
couple's lawsuit claims the FBI and the military violated the Privacy 
Act, the Stored Communications Act and the Fourth and Fifth Amendments 
by collecting emails Jill Kelley exchanged with military leaders and by 
releasing her name to the public.

They also filed privacy and defamation actions against several 'John Does'.

The
Kelleys are seeking an apology, a declaration that the FBI violated the
Stored Communications Act, fair compensation and attorneys' fees, 
according to their attorneys.

The subsequent investigation led to Broadwell being exposed as Petraeus's mistress and led to his resignation as CIA director.

General John Allen, the top US commander in Afghanistan, became ensnared in the scandal after it was revealed he sent thousands of emails to Kelley.

Kelley knew both men from throwing lavish parties for military chiefs based at MacDill Airforce base near her home in Tampa, Florida.

In the fallout from the scandal, Kelley was stripped of her role as a honorary consul for South Korea.

She was forced to return her vanity car registration plates and banned from MacDill Airforce Base.
