A teenage girl with mental health issues was kept in a police cell for two days because there were no free NHS beds in the whole country.

The 16-year-old was detained by Devon and Cornwall officers on Thursday after allegedly causing a breach of the peace at Torbay Hospital. She was sectioned under the Mental Health Act on Friday.

But there were no free beds for children with mental health issues in England, so she stayed in a cell. Police bought her McDonald’s food and her mother visited, bringing officers chocolates to thank them.

The issue was finally resolved last night when NHS England said she would be put in a ‘local bed’ at once.

Earlier, Assistant Chief Constable Paul Netherton had revealed his frustration on Twitter, saying: ‘This can’t be right! … Custody on a Fri night is no place for a child suffering mental health issues. Nurses being sourced to look after her in custody!?’

Police can detain anyone having a mental health crisis for up to 72 hours, but problems arise if detainees need an inpatient bed. A report earlier this year found that there are fewer than 2,000 beds for young mental health patients in England.

MP Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, described the delay in finding a bed as ‘abhorrent’.
