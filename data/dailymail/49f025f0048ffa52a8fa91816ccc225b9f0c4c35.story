By anyone’s standards, Lucifer is a pretty hellish name to call your offspring – and authorities in New Zealand have effectively banned parents from using it, along with that of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.

The country's Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages has also turned down Baron, Bishop, Duke, General, Judge, King, Knight and Mr, apparently because they sound too much like titles.

The crackdown on naming freedom could 
well stem from global headlines in 2008 that revealed that two Kiwi boys
 bore the names Violence and Number 16 Bus Shelter.

Name game: Parents in New Zealand have banned parents from calling their children Lucifer or Adolf Hitler

Calling your bundle of joy a punctuation mark, like . (full-stop) or * (asterisk) or simply a letter is also a no-no.

Several parents tried to register C, D, I and T, but weren’t allowed. According to reports, q and J were given the green light after the mothers and fathers appealed.

One New Zealand judge has warned parents that giving your child a bizarre name could lead to psychological trauma for it in later life.

‘It makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap,’ Family Court Judge Rob Murfitt said in 2008 after granting nine-year-old Talula Does the Hula From Hawaii permission to assume a more straightforward title.

There are some odd names here in Britain, too.

Website thebabywebsite.com recently revealed that Barb Dwyer,  Ray Gunn, Mary Christmas, Max Power, Justin Case and Chris Cross had all been registered.

Sweden also has a proud history of giving babies strange titles. The requests don’t always succeed, though.

‘Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116’ didn’t get through, but Google and Lego did.

Odd: Victoria and David Beckham called their recently born baby Harper Seven

In celebland, funny names are all the rage.

Our very own David and Victoria Beckham have named their first baby daughter Harper Seven, which one Twitter user said sounded ‘like a serious infection’.

In Hollywood, meanwhile, actor Sylvester Stallone gave his son the middle name of Sage Moonblood and director Steven Spielberg called his young son Destry.
