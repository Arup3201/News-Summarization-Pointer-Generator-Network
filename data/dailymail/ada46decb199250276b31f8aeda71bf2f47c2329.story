Who is the only Englishman to manage five national teams? Here’s a clue: he once scored a hat-trick in a trial match for Chelsea and played in goal for Millwall twice. Any closer?

The answer is Stephen Constantine, who in May was appointed as manager of Rwanda. He was born in London’s East End to an English-Irish mother and Cypriot father but his football career has taken him to more than 80 countries.

As a player, it never quite worked out for Constantine. He was 16 when he played in that trial match for Chelsea and scored a hat-trick from central midfield — even though he was a striker. Six weeks later, the knock-back letter arrived.

Two years on, Constantine, then a goalkeeper, had unsuccessful trials for Millwall.

He relocated to Cyprus and signed for AEL Limassol. He was called up to the Cyprus Under 23 side but turned them down after being ordered to do national service. ‘I told them I’ll wait for Ron Greenwood, who was England manager at the time, and I’m still waiting,’ he jokes.

When he was 19 he joined his brother Costas in America and spent a decade playing for Pennsylvania Stoners and New York Freedoms but had to give up when he snapped a ligament in his knee.

Constantine’s footballing desire was undiminished so he gained his coaching badges. It was while he was back in Cyprus coaching that he met his wife, Lucy, who was there on holiday.

‘On the first date we went to Pizza Hut and I told her I like my football,’ he explains. ‘She asked how bad can that be? I said if there’s a match on telly I’ll watch it, if there’s a game within 1,000 miles of the house I’ll be there and if I get offered a job anywhere in the world I feel is right I’ll do it.’

Mrs Constantine couldn’t complain she hadn’t been warned. When Nepal came calling, in 1999, offering him his first international job and a contract worth $3,000 a month, Constantine accepted.

HUGGING THE CROWN PRINCE OF NEPAL

At the South East Asia Games, which we were hosting, we met the Maldives in the semi-final. I wore traditional Nepalese dress. We won 2-1 and on the lap of honour, the Crown Prince had come on to the pitch and people were falling to the floor. He hugged me and everyone was gasping as you’re not allowed to touch the royal family.

70,000 NORTH KOREAN FANS — BUT NO NOISE

Travelling to North Korea for an Olympic qualifier was surreal. At the airport we all had to hand in our mobile phones and weren’t allowed them back until we left. We lost 2-0 in front of a 70,000-capacity crowd but there was no noise until they scored, when they all stood up, clapped politely then sat back down again.

10,000 AT KOLKATA AIRPORT

After my first three months as India’s manager, we travelled to Vietnam for the LG Cup. We were 2-0 down after 22 minutes in the final against them, but in the 90th minute scored the winner. When we landed back in Kolkata , 10,000 fans greeted us. It took more than two hours to get from the baggage carousel to the team bus.

His wife and first daughter, Paula, followed three months later, flying into unrest among Maoists in the country. Constantine called on a favour from his goalkeeper, who was also a policeman. They drove in an armoured truck straight on to the runway to meet Lucy and baby Paula off the plane. As they departed, the pair were flanked by four policeman with shotguns.

Two years later, Constantine left with the highest honour available to a foreigner, the Prabal Gorkha Dakshin Bahu, awarded to him by the Nepalese royal family — and a second child, Christiana.

He worked as assistant director at Bournemouth’s Centre of Excellence before, within a year, the Indian national team asked him to take charge.

When he arrived in India, the team didn’t have a kit sponsor, but Constantine managed to negotiate a £5million deal with Nike. He led them to their first international tournament win in 42 years, coming from 2-0 down to beat Vietnam in the final of the LG Cup.

Constantine’s eyes light up as he discusses a brief spell as Millwall’s first-team coach and the family’s decision to move to Cyprus. They flew over followed by 130 boxes. Then he received a call saying he was wanted by Malawi. ‘I told my wife I’d see her in three months and left before the boxes arrived,’ he recounts. ‘She is a saint.’

He endured a frustrating year: the players were indisciplined and the national team accommodation had wooden beds with sheets that barely covered the players’ midriffs. The mosquito nets were patchy — and the mosquitoes over there can kill. Constantine packed his bags again, heading back to Cyprus, and within a year was in charge of Sudan.

The day he touched down in Khartoum he visited the British embassy. They warned him to stay off the streets because a warrant for the arrest of president Omar al-Bashir was expected and they couldn’t guarantee his safety. He had to have a police escort to scout a left back and could only stay at the ground for 15 minutes, despite driving hours through the desert to get there. That job, too, lasted a year, and he returned to Cyprus.

Not long ago he met Roy Hodgson at King’s Cross in London. ‘I told him to bring England to Rwanda and play us instead of pointless friendlies,’ Constantine says. ‘The feelgood factor you will generate will be unbelievable. He laughed and said he didn’t even know where Rwanda is. I told him not to worry about that.’

At this point in the interview, Constantine’s family arrive. Paula is now 16, Christiana 14 and Isabel nine. They surround their father in the cafe in Brighton where we meet and hear him recall working as Lawrie Sanchez’s assistant at Greek side Apollon Smyrni before taking the Rwanda job in the summer.

Constantine, now 51, is already growing into a hero there. His target is to prepare the team for when the country hosts the African Nations Championship in 2016 — similar to the Africa Cup of Nations but a tournament only players from African clubs can participate in.

‘Before I took over, in their last 17 games they had won once, drawn five and lost the rest,’ he says. ‘I thought the only way is up.’

The country went mad when Constantine led them to shock victories against Libya and Congo Brazzaville to reach the qualification stage for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations.

But they have since been disqualified after Congo complained that striker Daddy Birori had a passport for both Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In August, they lost an appeal against the decision. For Constantine, it seems, the adventure is never over.
