North Korea has circulated a draft UN resolution praising its own human rights record and proclaimed it has 'nothing to hide' from the world.

In a closed meeting, dozens of diplomats sat in silence after the North handed out copies in a rare effort to counter the international community's condemnation of its oppression.

China finally broke the silence, saying it strongly opposes resolutions that interfere in a country's internal affairs, a pointed reference to a separate resolution sharply criticising North Korea's human rights record.

The EU told the North Koreans that Pyongyang's recent contacts with EU officials have been welcome, but that doesn't mean its joint resolution with Japan criticising the North will be withdrawn.

No diplomat commented on the draft resolution in the meeting, which broke up after just 20 minutes. The North Koreans said comments are welcome until the end of the month.

'Don't hesitate to contact me,' one said.

The draft was not circulated publicly. In a letter to diplomats circulated last week, North Korea said its resolution for the U.N. General Assembly would mention the country's free education and medical systems and the 'recent positive measures' to improve relations with South Korea.

North Korea has taken the unusual approach of promoting its rights record in the months since a U.N. commission of inquiry report was harshly critical of the impoverished, reclusive regime.

The 372-page report accused the North of running political prison camps with up to 120,000 people and sponsoring abductions of South Koreans, Japanese and others.

The EU and Japan are now encouraging the Security Council to follow that report's recommendations and refer North Korea's situation to the International Criminal Court. Their draft resolution for the General Assembly's human rights committee also presses for targeted sanctions.

Tthe North Koreans briefly made their case for their draft yesterday, saying Pyongyang has been reaching out to the international community and that it participates in U.N. human rights work.

They also said North Korea, Myanmar and Iran are all examples of countries that are frequent targets of resolutions like the EU-Japan one.

The EU told the meeting it had received no recent examples of North Korea engaging with the U.N. side on human rights.

The EU-Japan draft resolution is non-binding and also needs approval by the 193-member General Assembly.

Even if the more powerful Security Council takes up the recommendation to refer North Korea's situation to the ICC, the effort is expected to fail because China would likely use its veto power as a permanent council member.
