Arsenal have been rocked by a potential double injury blow as Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey were forced off with injuries during Tuesday's 2-1 win at home to Leicester City.

Sanchez started the midweek clash at the Emirates, after returning from a hamstring injury, but hurt his left knee and was under-par until he was replaced on 68 minuted by striker Olivier Giroud.

The incident came following a tackle by Leicester defender Matthew Upson, that left the 26-year-old nursing his knee with ice once he was substituted.

Second-half replacement Ramsey lasted only nine minutes before succumbing to a third hamstring strain of the campaign - with Mathieu Flamini taking the 24-year-old's position. 

'I cannot say it is not a worry,' said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger post-match; a double negative within the overall positive of clinging onto the lead. 'It is not good news.'

After the game, Sanchez later delivered a cryptic tweet hinting that his injury may have been more than a 'knock' as Wenger claimed.

'Sometimes the love for the game and anxiety to be on a football pitch works against you,' he tweeted.

The Chile international had missed the Gunners' previous two Premier League games against Aston Villa and arch-rivals Tottenham, and it is unclear at the moment if he will now be available for their FA Cup fifth round home clash against Championship leaders Middlesbrough on Sunday.

Tuesday's win at home to the Foxes moves Arsenal up into fourth in the Premier League table with 45 points after 24 games.

First-half goals from Laurent Koscielny and Theo Walcott gave the hosts a 2-0 lead before Andrej Kramaric's strike made it for a tense final 30 minutes.
