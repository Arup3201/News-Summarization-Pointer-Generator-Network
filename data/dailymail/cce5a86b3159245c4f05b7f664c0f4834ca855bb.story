Two young-at-heart lovebirds have married and become Britain's oldest newly-weds, with a combined age of 188.

Ted Parsons, 98, and Jean Reed, 90, have been dating for 20 years and live together in New Malden, south London. They married at Kingston Register Office, Surrey, in front of friends and family, and narrowly missed making it into the Guinness Book Of World Records.

The title of world's oldest newlyweds is currently held by widower Lillian Hartley, 95, and retired 
vet Allan Marks, 98, who married in California last March and boast a combined 
age of 193.

Ted said: 'I love her very much. It grows with age - it started as a friendship and then it grew into something different'

Speaking about his courtship with Jean, Ted said: 'We used to go out for dates, but nothing too romantic - we were grown up. We never went mad - might have been different if we were 17 or 18.

'If I had gone down on one knee I would have needed help to get up again.'

They couple met 20 years ago when Ted, a painter, visited Jean's home in Stuart Lodge, New Malden, and they have lived there together ever since.

They opted for a simple ceremony on 
Saturday, with Ted wearing a pale blue suit, and the couple walked in 
arm-in-arm with the youngest of Ted's five children, Andrew, as best 
man.

Andrew, 63, said: 
'One of dad's neighbours - she is very operatic - sang Here Comes The 
Bride as we went through to the registry. That took us all by surprise.

'It's not the norm to get hitched, when most people are getting divorced.

'It's
just one of those things where they are not going to live forever - 
happiness in their last few years of life is all they want.

'I
told my dad I could take him paintballing or quad-biking for his stag 
but he declined - no sense of fun. He said to me, "Andrew I just want a 
quiet day, I don't want any fuss".'

Ted, who served in the Royal West Kent Infantry regiment, said the couple hoped to get out more now they were married.

They are considering driving to the south coast for their honeymoon, as Ted has just had his licence renewed for three years.

He said: 'I love her very much. It grows with age - it started as a friendship and then it grew into something different. I have got to look after Jean now for the rest of my days and she has got to look after me.'

They got married at a registry office in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, last week
