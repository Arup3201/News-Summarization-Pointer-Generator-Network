She was one fifth of the biggest and most glamorous girl group in pop's history. But reflecting on her time with Girls Aloud, Sarah Harding has admitted that she was too thin.

Speaking to MailOnline, Sarah said: 'I was too skinny when I was with the girls, it was ageing.'

The 32-year-old has now adopted a much more healthy approach to her weight and, like many celebrities, has jumped on the juicing bandwagon.

Sarah Harding, posing in a new beauty campaign for Faceb4, says she was too skinny when she was in pop group Girls Aloud

'I've caught the juicing bug. I love being in the kitchen and cooking and creating juices and smoothies every day.

'I
 love anything green and I make my own juices packed with kale, parsley,
 cucumber, courgettes, apples, plus spirulina and chlorella.

'If I want to fill myself up I will add ice and half an avocado. It looks gross, but it tastes great.'

The pop star loves juicing so much that she visits the Jason Vale juicing retreat twice a year. 'It's hard, we don't eat,' she said of her time there.

Despite her love of all things green, Sarah says that she eats plenty throughout the day and loves sweet treats.

Too thin: Sarah, pictured left with Nadine Coyle when the group first started out in 2004 and, right, in 2007, says her skinny look was 'ageing'

'I'm Irish, I love stodge! I'm a picker but I do try to steer clear of gluten because it bloats me, there's lots of great gluten-free alternatives though.

'I have a naughty cupboard at home with Skittles and Haribo from my fans who know I love them,' she said.

Sarah is
 on a mission to undo the years of late nights and has even signed up as
 an ambassador for anti-bacterial face wash, 
Faceb4.

The brand said Sarah was the perfect ambassador because she is so honest about her breakouts.

Speaking
 about her skin, Sarah said: ‘Travelling a lot doesn’t agree with my 
skin so I am obsessed with cleansing morning and night at the moment.

‘I
 am hooked on Faceb4, which I use before photo shoots 
because it removes the bacteria before applying cosmetics and keeps my 
skin healthy. It's also amazing after a heavy weekend!'

Green and lean: Sarah revealed that she loves juicing and makes a super-nutritious green juice every morning to keep her health in check

Aside from juicing and hitting the gym three times, Sarah is focusing on her hotly-anticipated solo career.

'I
 am so excited about my new music, it speaks volumes about my 
personality. I love writing songs but I find the recording process very 
monotonous and quite draining.

'I know it will be worth it in the end, it will be such an amazing sense of achievement and I hope it's well received; I'm my own worst critic.'

If there was one member of Girls Aloud who loved a good time, it was without a doubt Sarah.

But
 the notorious party girl says she's calmed down and now prefers to spend her evenings in a more conservative way.

'Me and my partner Mark are addicted to Breaking Bad. We watch three episodes a night and sit there munching away on popcorn together.'

Family plans: Speaking on ITV's Lorraine show yesterday, Sarah said she wasn't planning to have children anytime soon

Still a party girl at heart: Sarah celebrated her new campaign with Faceb4 at private member's club Mortons last night

Despite her cosy life with DJ Mark Foster, Sarah insists that she won't be following bandmate Kimberley Walsh and Nadine Coyles's footsteps by having a baby.

Speaking about Kimberley's pregnancy announcement, she said: 'I wasn't at all surprised, she's been with Justin for years and years but it won't be me next. I have a lot of boxes to tick before I start a family.'

Fabulous five! Sarah and her Girls Aloud bandmates (L-R) Nadine Coyle, Cheryl Cole, Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts. Sarah is now working on her solo music and couldn't be more excited

Long-term love: Sarah currently lives with her long-term boyfriend, DJ Mark Foster and the duo enjoy cosy nights in watching Breaking Bad
