Mystery surrounds the death of a promising young graphic designer, who was found dead at her parents' home in a quiet, upscale neighborhood in Malibu, California.

Katie Wilkins, 25, was on the garage floor when her brother discovered her body on Saturday after her parents left town for the weekend. Police still have no idea how she died.

Among the many bizarre circumstances of her death: her 1998 BMW Z3 convertible is missing; all of the doors to the house were locked; and the family's dog was found wandering the neighbourhood.Â

Mysterious: Authorities can't tell how Katie Wilkins, 25, died. She was found in a locked house with the washer still running

Clue: Police are searching for Miss Wilkins' BMW Z3, pictured, which was stolen from the garage

When Miss Wilkins' older brother went to her parents' house to check on her, he discovered her cold, limp body on the concrete floor of the garage.

The washing machine was running and food was on the stove, indicating she had died only moments before being found, LA Weekly reports.

'All of a sudden, a bunch of questions come through, what happened? How could she be left like this? Was she alone?', Steve Wilkins told KABC-TV.

Miss Wilkins' family believes she was with at least one other person when she died and that person panicked and fled with her BMW.

Controversially, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office has ruled out foul play after an autopsy.

What happened? Miss Wilkins' brother found his sister's cold, dead body here on the floor of the garage

Upscale: The family lives in a wealthy neighborhood of Malibu, where officials have a reputation for trying to keep the homicide rate at zero

Mr Wilkins says he could see no signs of trauma on his sister's body. The medical examiner's office has not conducted toxicology tests yet and an autopsy did not reveal a cause of death.

Officials in Malibu have a reputation for trying to keep the murder rate in the upscale community at zero.

They complained vigorously last year when the sheriff's office declared a restaurant worker's death a homicide, according to LA Weekly.

This leaves Miss Wilkins' family still searching for answers about what could possibly happened to their beloved daughter.

Miss Wilkins was a graphic designer who was living with her parents while she launched her own business.

Desperate: Miss Wilkins' brother, Steve Wilkins, right, pleaded for anyone with information about his sister's death to come forward

She attended the Art Institute of California in Orange County and had worked with several companies, including Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.

'We're not angry. We're not upset with anyone who might have been with her,' Mr Wilkins told KTLA-TV.

'We just want them to come forward and help bring some closure to Katie. She was loved by a lot of people.'
