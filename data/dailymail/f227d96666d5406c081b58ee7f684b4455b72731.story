Confession: Award-winning TV chef Jean-Christophe Novelli has revealed he is losing the ability to hear after spending years in noisy kitchens

As an award-winning TV chef, he has been a regular fixture on our screens for more than a decade.

But Jean-Christophe Novelli's culinary skills appear to have come at a price - his hearing.

The 53-year-old has revealed that he is losing the ability to hear after spending years in noisy kitchens.

He said the clanging of steel, whirring of machines and endless stream of shouted instructions had caused him to develop a degree of deafness. 

He is now dependent on a hearing aid after being diagnosed with age-related and noise-related severe hearing loss.

Novelli, who has won four Michelin stars, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Chefs work in very noisy 
environments.

'You don’t speak, you scream. The sense of 
urgency means there is a lot of movement. It is horrendous – the 
banging, the pots – even for someone who has clear hearing.'

The French chef, who has been working in restaurant kitchens since arriving in Britain aged 22, said he first noticed problems with his hearing after struggling to grasp conversations and TV shows.

He began having to crane his neck and intensely concentrate to hear - leading to neck stiffness and painful headaches.

But despite the signs, he remained in denial - believing he was too young to suffer from deafness.

He only sought help after his fiancée,
 Michelle Kennedy, persuaded him to get tested - and was finally 
diagnosed with severe hearing loss at Specsavers in Hitchen, 
Hertfordshire.

'Why did I not seek help sooner? Because 
I’m a prat,' said Novelli. 'I never admitted it. How long could I have been 
better off if I had not been putting pride or vanity before everything?'

Novelli opened Maison Novelli in Clerkenwell in 1996, before going on to open a string of other restaurants across the country.

He said the Four Seasons in Park Lane, London - featuring 20 departments - had the noisiest kitchens of all.

During his career, his hearing problems meant he struggled to hold conversations with colleagues, members of the public and even other celebrities, including the Princess Royal and Baroness Thatcher.

But the chef said his new hearing aid had transformed his life - adding that he was 'delighted' it was so discreet as to be unnoticeable.

He has now appealed to other over-50s suffering from hearing problems to seek help and get tested. 

He is also fronting Specsavers's 'Putting hearing loss on the menu' campaign, which aims to raise awareness of age-related hearing loss.

At present, 8 per cent of people in their 40s suffer from hearing loss - rising to 19 per cent of people in their 50s, according to Action on Hearing Loss.

Symptoms include difficulty in hearing people clearly, misunderstanding what others say, asking people to repeat themselves and listening to music or watching television with the volume turned up high.
