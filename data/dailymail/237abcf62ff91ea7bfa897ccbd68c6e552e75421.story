On trial: Sister Ruth Augustus outside Harrow Crown Court today

A nun has been convicted of sending six envelopes containing white powder to parliamentary figures including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.

Sister Ruth Augustus, 71, of Leyton, east London, denied six counts of hoaxes involving noxious substances or things.

She accepted that she sent 
envelopes with letters in them but claimed police put the white powder 
in them, the court was told.

One was addressed to Mr Clegg and on the
envelope was written 'devil worshipping', 'freemason', 'sex with 30 
plus women' and 'your poor Catholic wife and children'.

The letters were intercepted, three at a time on two separate occasions, at a mail screening centre.

The powder was found to be non-hazardous, Harrow Crown Court in west London was told.

Mr Justice Saunders deferred the case until September for a hearing at the Old Bailey while a medical report is prepared on Augustus’s mental health.

She was released on bail on condition that she 'does not contact, directly or indirectly, any MP or senior Government official' unless through her solicitor, the court heard.

Mark Kimsey, prosecuting, said three envelopes were intercepted at a mail screening centre in east London on June 17 last year.

A worker was checking mail when three envelopes raised concerns.

The second letter was to Baroness Scotland, and had a swastika on it and two crosses, and 'stop this evil devil worshipping'.

The third letter was to Baroness Kennedy, and was endorsed with a swastika, and 'stop these evil devil worshipping freemasons'.

Both Baroness Scotland, left and Deputy Prime Minster Nick Clegg were sent envelopes containing white powder. Addressed to Mr Clegg, the envelope had 'devil worshipping' written on the outside

The envelopes contained a gritty substance, but it was found they had already tested negative for anthrax, and specialist police who were called in found them to be non-hazardous.

On October 1, at the same place, three more envelopes were found, addressed to Mr Clegg, Lady Kennedy and MP Edward Leigh.

The envelopes carried similar endorsements and slogans and contained white powder which was found to be non-hazardous.

On December 7, Augustus was arrested at a hotel where she was staying in north west London and told police 'It’s a load of lies', Mr Kimsey said.

The trial heard that Augustus told police during interview: 'I’m Sister Ruth, a 71-year-old disabled nun.'

She also said: 'I look like a terrorist, don’t I, working for a charity all over the world, with orphans?'

The jury heard that she told interviewing officer Detective Constable Anne Adams: 'The police are run by freemasons. All the top women are in it.'

Asked why she had sent a letter to Mr Leigh, she said: 'He’s a Catholic, and goes to Westminster Cathedral.'

As for Mr Clegg, she said he 'lied about all the tuition fees and everything else, keeping those Tory millionaires and rats in government'.

She added: 'He boasted about all the women he’s had sex with. He’s an atheist singing hymns in the Albert Hall.'

At one point she said: 'I’m not a Muslim terrorist, I’m a Catholic nun.'

And she said of the police: 'They opened the envelopes, and put white powder in, to frame me. I know they monitor it all.

'I’m a Catholic nun, with more brains and intelligence than the police.'

Asked if she was sending the letters for attention, she said: 'Of course I am. I’m deliberately writing on the envelope as well so all the postmen will know all about it.'

Following her conviction, Augustus turned to the public gallery as she left the courtroom and said she would be appealing against the verdict.

A jury took less than two-and-a-half 
hours to find her guilty by a majority verdict of 11 to one on all 
counts following a three-day trial.
