Melissa Odabash makes 'look at me' bathing suits – the sort of thing that celebrities turn to when they want to get noticed on the beach. Her boutiques are not, you might imagine, the first place a woman would visit when shopping for swimwear after a mastectomy.

Well, that's set to change. Later this month, Melissa unveils a characteristically sexy range designed with the unique needs of post-breast cancer surgery patients in mind. And if the reaction already generated on social media is anything to go by, it's going to be a hit.

Sky presenter Jacquie Beltrao is the face of the range, which is raising money for the charity Future Dreams. The 49-year-old ex-gymnast, who bravely spoke about her brush with breast cancer in these pages last year, has been photographed wearing the costumes – and looks stunning.

'I was daunted, of course – what woman wouldn't be?' she admits. 'But I wanted to do it because of the fact I don't look as perfect as many of Melissa's other models. It's better that I'm up there with my normal lumps and bumps because this is what a woman looks like.'

Jacquie discovered a tumour in her right breast in December 2013 and underwent a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction a month later. She also had chemotherapy and is currently clear of cancer. 'I had a reconstruction using animal tissue and a small implant, so there is very little scarring,' she says.

'You'd probably not be able to tell unless you looked closely – I think I just look like I have pretty good boobs for a woman who's had three children. But still I wouldn't wear a very low-cut bikini top as you'd see the scars. And everyone is different. You might have one or both breasts removed. Some women don't have an immediate reconstruction. Some can't and some choose not to.'

Melissa first pondered the difficulties women face after her sister Jamie needed a mastectomy a decade ago. 'It's especially hard if you have one breast,' she says. 'The only option to make things look even is an insert, but it's so difficult to get these to look natural next to the real breast. We've worked really hard on finding the right weights of fabrics and padding.'

The designs are made from a soft microfibre fabric and there are no seams or wiring. 'They look like my usual designs, but have a little bit more fabric here and there,' adds Melissa. 'They're cut a bit higher on the chest, and they have slightly wider shoulder straps as often women are left with scars there too from the surgery.'

One woman who has welcomed the range is life coach Lucy O'Donnell, who was diagnosed with incurable breast cancer in 2011, aged 47, and underwent a mastectomy the following year.

The author, whose book Cancer Is My Teacher was serialised in The Mail on Sunday last year, says: 'I have always loved swimming and was depressed after my mastectomy to find the bathing costumes available for women like me seemed… well, let's call them functional at best.

'A friend jokes that when she wore hers, she'd often look down to see one of her breasts sitting somewhere around her midriff. Melissa's designs work brilliantly, and are stunning.'

Jacquie, who tested a couple of the designs on holiday in Brazil over Christmas, admits she would never have posed in a swimsuit had she not had cancer, but says she felt 'liberated' by the modelling experience. 'I hope women who might be where I was a year ago – coming to terms with a diagnosis of cancer and facing surgery, worrying that they will be mutilated – will see them and think, yes, there is hope.'

Melissa Odabash Future Dreams Collection will be launched at Fenwick's on February 10, and will be available at netaporter.com from March. All swimsuits cost £150 and proceeds go to Future Dreams.

In the grand scheme of things, whether or not a woman with cancer can buy a fancy designer bikini might seem low on the list of priorities. 

But part of recovery from cancer is learning to feel normal again. 

As Lucy O'Donnell points out on this page, just because she's had a mastectomy doesn't mean she wants to start shopping for clothes from medical catalogues. 

Right from her diagnosis, Jacquie approached her breast cancer with a wonderfully positive mental attitude. 

But she also spoke openly of her fears of losing her hair, and her breasts (both of which she did) – of appearing to be 'a cancer victim' to the outside world. 

She's better now, and most importantly at this point, she looks it too.
