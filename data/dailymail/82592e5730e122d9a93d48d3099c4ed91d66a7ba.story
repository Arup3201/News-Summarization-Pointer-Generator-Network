Forcing your spouse to wear particular clothes, deciding which friends they can see and ‘excessive jealousy’ could become crimes as part of changes to domestic violence laws, it emerged last night.

Ministers are considering whether to make forms of ‘psychological abuse’ which do not involve violence into criminal offences punishable by law.

It follows a campaign from women’s groups who say there is too much focus on specific incidents in which someone was hurt by their partner.

Instead, they said, crimes of domestic abuse should include non-violent acts against wives or husbands.

But last night, criminologists warned that any definition of abuse that included non-violent acts would hand huge ‘arbitrary’ power to the police.

Dr David Green, director of the Civitas think tank said: ‘Lots of couples are going to exchange angry words from time to time but there’s not the least chance of it turning into a fight. For others a raised voice or a fierce glare might be terrifying.’

He warned: ‘It’s very easy for society to slide in to a kind of police state where police can define something as against the law when in reality they are a bit of a barney but not something the police should get involved in.

‘Before you know it you could be in a Police State where a little bit of aggro could lead to the police being involved and someone being carted off to the police station.’

The proposals were published yesterday by the Domestic Violence Law Reform Campaign, which said existing laws fail to take into account ‘power and control’ in relationships.

It is calling on ministers to criminalise ‘coercive control’ and behaviour which causes psychological harm.

Laura Richards, director of Paladin said:
 ‘It is possible for the law to criminalise a course of conduct and move
 beyond physical injury.’

She said the law should take account of a ‘course of conduct’ and ‘address a broad range of harm’.

Polly Neate, chief executive of Women’s Aid said the criminal justice system was wrongly focused on ‘individual incidents of physical violence’ and failed to reflect the ‘ongoing psychological harm caused by coercive control in intimate relationships.’

A survey of abuse victims carried out by the campaign group found 94 per cent of those surveyed said mental cruelty could be worse than physical violence.

The Home Office’s own definition of domestic violence already includes ‘coercive control’ - but until there has been no move towards making them a criminal offence.

This coercion can include being excessively jealous, stopping someone from seeing family and friends or controlling what the victim wears.

Last night Home Office officials confirmed the proposal would be considered as part of a review of how the police deal with domestic violence.

It will be examined by ministers alongside a report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary into how forces are investigating such crimes.

Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: ‘The government is committed to working with the police and other criminal justice agencies to ensure the response to domestic violence and abuse offers the best possible protection to victims.

‘The Home Secretary has commissioned Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) to conduct a review across all police forces of the response to domestic abuse.

‘We will carefully consider the case for any change to the law against the backdrop of HMIC’s findings and recommendations.’

In September 2012 the government’s definition of domestic violence and abuse includes ‘psychological, financial and emotional’ factors.

It includes ‘isolating’ someone from sources of support, exploiting their wealth  and ‘regulating their everyday behaviour’.
