Mugshot: Alicia Gray pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree sodomy and one count of second-degree sexual abuse. She has now been sentenced to six months in jail and five years probation

A former Alabama high school teacher who was married, pleaded guilty to having sex with a student, and has been sentenced to immediately serve jail time as well as surrender her teaching certificate.

Alicia Gray, 28, accepted a plea deal by prosecutors as she was convicted of engaging in a sexual act or deviant sexual intercourse with a student under 19 years old.

Gray was sentenced to serve six months behind bars with five years of probation.

As a condition of the probation, Gray will no longer be allowed to be employed with minors, and was required to surrender her teaching certificate to the Alabama Department of Education at once.

The former math teacher at Mary G. Montgomery surrendered to the Mobile County Sheriffâ€™s Office in February of last year and charged with second-degree sodomy, sexual abuse and being a school employee who has had sexual contact with a student younger than 19.

It was alleged that her victim was 14 years old at the time of the incident.

The student told investigators his relationship with Gray started around New Year's Day 2013 and became more serious, ultimately leading to 'an exchange of oral sex' near or at the victim's home.

The boy also told police Gray 'took several nude pictures' of herself and sent them to him via cell phone.

She had been on paid administrative since her arrest, but she resigned from the school system several months ago.

'We
 regret any circumstance like this, but when the allegations came out, 
we acted quickly. We deeply regret this ever happened,' schools 
Superintendent Martha Peek said in a statement.

At the time of her arrest, Gray was accompanied by her husband 
and attorney when she surrendered herself to authorities at Mobile 
County Metro Jail, after a warrant had been issued for her arrest and an
 investigation into the relationship was launched.

Popular teacher: Former students off Gray said they were shocked by the allegations

On the MGM High School's website, Gray described herself as 'highly qualified in mathematics.'

Former students said they were shocked by the allegations.

'She's really cool,' said former student Matt Boykin. 'I had her class when I was in ninth grade. I struggled with math a lot, and she really helped me.'

Gray had graduated from Mary G 
Montgomery High school and went on to pursue a bachelor degree in 
mathematics education from the University of Mobile in May 2007.

She then received her masterâ€™s degree in teaching and learning from Nova Southeastern University in May 2011.
