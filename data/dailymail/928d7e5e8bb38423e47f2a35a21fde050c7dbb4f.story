Speaking to the MailOnline, she said: 'He was such a precious little boy, 
that's all I can say, he was a very fun-loving, typical little boy. He was 
just a very soft spoken, gentle young man.'

Asked if the army had changed her son, she said: 'I have no idea I had not been in contact
 with him that much. Actually in the last 12 years I have not been in 
contact with him at all since his dad and I divorced.

'I just found out this morning when another newspaper called me. Of course I'm devastated.

'My heart goes out to all the people who lost 
their loved ones, that's all I can say, I am so sorry.'

Wade Michael Page was 
kicked out of the army in 1998 after serving six years, first as a missile system repairman at Fort Bliss in Texas and then at Fort Bragg where he was in
Psychological Operations.

He was given a less-than-honorable 
discharge from the army in October 1998 following a 'pattern of misconduct' including 
being drunk on duty and going AWOL sources said.

He had been demoted from sergeant to specialist during his service and was deemed ineligible for re-enlistment.

While
 in the Army, Wade - originally from Colorado - served as a sergeant, and later as a specialist based 
in Ft Bliss in Texas and at Ft Bragg in North Carolina.

The details of his discharge were not immediately clear.

According to the Examiner,
 Page was an E4 psychological operations specialist. He was awarded the 
Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct 
award, the National Defense Service Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal 
and Parachutist Badge.

The Anti-Defamation League had been tracking Wade since 2000 when he first appeared on the white supremacist music scene.

The band's MySpace page says their music is a 'sad
 commentary on our sick society and the problems that prevent true 
progress'. Song titles include Self Destruct and Submission

In 2010 he gave an interview to white 
supremacist website Label 56, telling them that he started the band End 
Apathy because of his wish to 'figure out how to end people's apathetic 
ways and start moving forward'.

He admitted the band was his idea and that  topics included 'sociological issues, 
religion, and how the value of human life has been degraded by being 
submissive to tyranny and hypocrisy that we are subjugated to'.

One of Page's many tattoos is a Celtic cross, with a 14 on it.

This number, according to the Anti-Defamation League, is also a white-supremacist symbol that refers to a fourteen-word slogan: 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.'

As well as this and the 9/11 tattoo, Page had lettering on his hands, a Celtic knot on his back and fire on his leg.

Police are calling the shooting at Wisconsin Sikh Temple an act of domestic terrorism after he shot dead six people and seriously wounded three more yesterday morning.

Page was finally gunned down by police officer Lt Brian Murphy, 51, who was 
shot 'eight or nine times' by the gunman and is now recovering in hospital.

The
 six victims - aged between 39 and 84 - have been identified as Bhai 
Seeta Singh, 41, Bhai Parkash Singh, 39, Bhai Ranjit Singh, 49, Satwant 
Singh Kaleka, 62, Subegh Singh, 84, Parmjit Kaur Toor, 41.

The injured in hospital are Bhai Punjab Singh - who is in extremely critical condition - and Santokh Singh.

Page was known to the Southern 
Poverty Law Center, which published a picture of him since taken  
standing in front of Nazi iconography with a visible tattoo of a Celtic 
cross with the number 14. 

The tattoo is said to refer to the Anti-Defamation 
League, another white-supremacist symbol that refers to a fourteen-word 
slogan: 'We must secure the existence of our people and a future for 
white children.'

He is also
 believed to have had 'lettering on his hands, a Celtic knot on his back
 and fire on his leg' as well as the 9/11 tattoo.

involved with bands called Youngland and Celtic Warrior, Radikahl, Max

The Center revealed they had been tracking Page since 2000 when he tried to purchase goods from the National Alliance.

Heidi Beirich, director of the center's 
intelligence project, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that there was
 'no question' Page was an ardent follower and believer in the white 
supremacist movement.

She said her center had evidence that he attended 'hate events' around the country and was involved in the scene.

The
 Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that has studied hate crimes for 
decades, reported today they had been tracking Page since 2000 .Also
 on Monday, a volunteer human-rights group called Responsible for 
Equality And Liberty (R.E.A.L.) found links between Page, his band and a
 white supremacist website called Stormfront, reported the Journal 
Sentinel.

Page moved to
 a duplex in the 3700 block of E. Holmes in Cudahy two weeks ago, which 
was cordoned off for a time on Sunday night as officials investigated 
inside, and residents were evacuated from their homes.

It is about six miles from the temple where the shooting took place.

Before
 that he lived in the south of Milwaukee with his girlfriend Misty who 
was going to the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and has an autistic 
son.

It has been reported that he recently broke up with her and that has been suggested as a possible motive.

David Brown, 62, a neighbor who lived in the same apartment building told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Page was a recluse.

'He was not a friendly guy. He was very quiet. You'd say hi and he'd kind of grunt. It was like he didn't care if you were talking or not.'

He said they moved out about four or five months ago.

A neighbor at his Cudahy duplex told CBS: 'Nobody has really seen him. We heard here and there that they’ve been doing a lot of arguing, between him and another female, but I haven’t seen him.'

The officers came out of the duplex around midnight, carrying large items, according to Cudahy Now.

Police roped off four blocks in a neighborhood with a mix of duplexes and single-family homes as FBI agents descended on Page's home with an armored truck, a trailer and other vehicles.

One woman said that the man who lived at that home 'kind of kept to himself'.

'I just remember seeing (a tattoo that said) 9-11. I just remember thinking it was weird, thinking "Why would you have that tattooed on you?"' April Reyna told the station.

Page is believed to have worked as a truck driver with Granger, Iowa-based Barr-Nunn Transportation, from about April 2006 to August 2010 while living in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

An employee at the company said he left 'involuntarily' but declined to elaborate.
