An Italian woman who underwent fertility treatment has become pregnant with the twins of another couple, after their embryos got mixed up. 

The devastating error was only discovered when the woman was three months pregnant.

The couples were among four prospective parents receiving fertility treatment at the same specialist unit of a Rome hospital on the same day last December.

The genetic mother of the twins also became pregnant after the medical intervention, but miscarried early on.

Legally she and her partner have no claim to the unborn children, as Italian law specifies that the mother is the woman who gives birth to the baby.

The pregnant woman, who has not been named, has decided to take the pregnancy to term, her lawyer told Italian newspaper La Repubblica.

‘I had a moment of human rejection when I knew that they were not mine, or rather ours, that the embryos that I was carrying were of another woman, but then we decided that the pregnancy had to continue, our values are these,’ said the woman according to her lawyer, Michele Ambrosini.

‘These children live inside me. I heard them beat on my heart. They grow and are healthy,’ the woman told the lawyer. ‘How can I decide the fate of two creatures so long-awaited?’

Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin has launched an investigation into the catastrophic error.

The woman has decided to continue with the pregnancy and will be legally entitled to keep the babies when they are born because Italian law defines the mother as the person who gives birth to the baby (file picture)

She said: ‘The national standards on assisted fertilisation, which are based on European directives, are very rigorous, and if applied correctly, guarantee the traceability of all biological material used in the reproduction process.’

The local health authority in Rome said it only became aware there was a problem of ‘genetic incompatibility’ between the parents and the embryos on March 27th.

It said it has halted all embryo implantations at the clinic until further notice.
