A grand mansion linked to Henry VIII has been turned into a block of luxury flats fit for a king - and for under £200,000 each. 

Preston Hall, a magnificent 55,000 sq.ft. Grade II listed mansion near Aylesford, Kent, was once the country residence of the Culpeper family, ancestors of Queen Catherine Howard, the fifth wife of King Henry VIII.

But after becoming an NHS facility in 1945 and suffering years of neglect, it was sold by the government to developers. 

Now house hunters wanting a bit of Wolf Hall or Downton Abbey in their lives can move into Preston Hall from just £195,000.

After becoming an NHS facility in 1945 and suffering years of neglect , it was sold by the government to developers. The once dilapidated home is now back to its former glory - albeit with a modern twist

The home has been luxuriously appointed and respectfully renovated. Now house hunters wanting a bit of Wolf Hall or Downton Abbey in their lives can move into Preston Hall from just £195,000

The government sold the Grade II listed mansion, near Aylesford, Kent, to Weston Homes for a 'nominal fee' which has transformed it into 36 apartments

The mansion was originally the home of the Culpeper family, a family Tudor dynasty, which featured in the mini-series, The Tudors, who held grand Courtly events and hunts with Henry VIII and Elizabeth I

The figure is around £18,000 more than the average price paid for a home in England and Wales - and £50,000 less than the average value of a property.

All flats boast period features, while the top-end £700,000 pads have huge mezzanine.

Bob Weston, boss of Weston Homes, said: 'With its links to King Henry VIII, its grand stone facade and spacious period interiors Preston Hall provided a rich historic backdrop on which we have layered a luxurious state-of-the-specification and new build elements in order to create the most outstanding contemporary homes to be unveiled in this part of Kent.

'Preston Hall is without doubt the most prestigious, challenging and unique restoration projects we have undertaken to date.'

One descendant of the family, Joyce Culpeper, married Edmund Howard and was the mother of Queen Catherine Howard, the fifth wife of King Henry VIII.

When Catherine became Henry VIII's wife Preston Hall became a centre for grand Courtly events and hunts.

However, Catherine had an affair with her distant cousin Sir Thomas Culpeper - a courtier to the King - and they were both beheaded for treason.

Ownership of the hall passed through relatives of the Culpeper family until it was purchased in 1848 by Edward Ladd Betts, a railroad baron.

In 1850 Edward and his wife Anne commissioned architect John Thomas to refurbish Preston Hall into the magnificent Jacobean mansion which currently stands on the site.

The home was purchased in 1848 by Edward Ladd Betts, a railroad baron. It was later sold and gifted it to The Red Cross, which used it as a hospital during World War One

John Thomas was a favourite architect of HRH Prince Albert, The Prince Consort and worked on Buckingham Palace, the Palace of Westminster and Somerleyton Hall. 

However, in 1867, the Betts family were bankrupted and he was forced to sell it to rival railway baron Thomas Brassey. 

In 1904 the family sold vast chunks of the original estate and the house and grounds were reduced to 24.9 acres. 

They sold it to the Sauber family, who later gifted it to The Red Cross, which used it as a hospital during World War One. 

Between 1945 to 2012 it became Preston Hall Hospital until it was sold in March this year by the Department for Health. Weston Homes is now going to plough millions into the site, building 36 one, two and three bedroom apartments.

As part of the restoration process the elegant ceilings - including the hammer-beamed ceiling with coats of arms - rich wood wall paneling, turrets and towers will the carefully restored to their formerly glory. Prices for the flats are expected to range from £170,000 to £750,000.

Mr Weston said: 'Preston Hall is one of the most prestigious, challenging and unique restoration projects we have undertaken to date.'
