Yellowstone National Park attracts many tourists each year who come to enjoy its landscape and wildlife.

But one couple got more than they bargained for when they came head to head with an American bison - also referred to as a buffalo - while on the road.

In the clip the car can be seen waiting in anticipation – indicator sounding – as a herd of three bison come galloping slowly towards it.

Getting closer and closer, the head bison shows no signs of adjusting its path and instead positions itself to line up with the car’s front bumper.

Reacting, the filmmaker exclaims: ‘Don’t run into our car,’ just as the bison crashes into it – the impact sends the camera up and then down into his lap.

Shocked, a lady in the car laughs as the man readjusts the camera and begins filming the two remaining bison, who look quite content standing sideways in the middle of the road.

Speaking about the incident, the filmmaker said: ‘I thought the bison would simply run by our car at a full clip.

'Instead, at the last minute, the lead bison veers to his left and intentionally head-butts our car. There was nothing we could do to avoid being hit.’

He added: 'It was fortunate that the car was turned off, since a head-on collision with a 2,000 pound bison moving at 10mph  would  likely cause the airbags to deploy.'

Readjusting the camera, which was thrown up and then down by the impact, the video maker captures the bison waking away

Yellowstone is the only place in America where bison have lived continuously since prehistoric times and as a result the area is home to the nation’s largest bison population on public land.

Known for being agile despite their size, as well as aggressive, Bison can charge at up to 35mph.

The bison population in Yellowstone is estimated at 4,600 in two breeding herds.
