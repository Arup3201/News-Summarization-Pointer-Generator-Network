Charlotte Dujardin OBE, with her rescued pony Santa, who she has adopted

Underweight and barely able to stand, he was just another horse abandoned by his owner.

Now, a better life has begun for Santa the foal after he was adopted by dressage champion and double Olympic gold medal winner Charlotte Dujardin.

The piebald gelding was close to death when he was rescued by the RSPCA in December.

However, when Ms Dujardin, pictured with Santa, met him through a friend, she fell in love – and decided to offer him a home.

Ms Dujardin, 28, a 2016 Olympic hopeful, said: ‘He caught my eye because, even though he was in a really bad condition, he was just so pretty. I felt so sorry for him. 

'I just wanted to give him the best chance of life.’

Dressage rider Ms Dujardin, who was born in Enfield and brought up in Hertfordshire, started riding when she was two-years old.

By the time she was 16 she had won the Horse of the Year Show competition four times and was a winner at Hickstead on three occasions.

She took up dressage with a horse bought from her grandmother’s inheritance any was offered her first job as a groom in Gloucestershire, where she has remained.

Ms Dujardin holds all three world records in dressage and just this month she also won the Reem Acra FEI World Cup Dressage Final in Lyon.

Ms Dujardin won two gold medals in the London 2012 Olympics and is hopeful she will have a place in the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

RSPCA rehoming co-ordinator Gareth Johnson added: ‘It is fantastic that someone of Charlotte’s standing is taking on a rescued pony.’
