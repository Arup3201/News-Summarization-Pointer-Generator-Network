This is the shocking moment that a gas pipe bursts in the road, causing the highway to rise and explode.

The explosion was caught on a camera inside the car and shows how the road opens up in a scene reminiscent of an action movie.

The person driving the car does not even have time to react and drives head-on into the erupting tarmac. 

As the concrete showers the car, the camera goes black. The incident occurred on an unknown dual carriageway in America. 

It is not known whether the driver of the car survived the accident which took place as two other cars drove on the opposite side of the carriageway.
