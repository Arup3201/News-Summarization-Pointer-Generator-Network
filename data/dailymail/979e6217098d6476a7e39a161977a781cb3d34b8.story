The bodies of ancient Iron Age warriors who fell in a battle around the time of Christ were impaled on wooden stakes in a gruesome religious ritual, say scientists.

Four pelvic bones on a stick and bundles of other desecrated remains testify to the ceremonial violence perpetrated on the corpses of the vanquished soldiers - six months after they were slain.

It happened about 2,000 years ago in a major clash between Germanic tribes close to the Danish town of Skanderborg at the edge of the Roman Empire.

Four pelvic bones on a stick were found at the dutch site, along with bundles of bones, bones bearing marks of cutting and scraping, and crushed skulls.

The battle happened about 2,000 years ago in a major clash between Germanic tribes close to the Danish town of Skanderborg at the edge of the Roman Empire.

Battles in the area were waged when major changes were taking place because the Roman Empire was expanding northwards - putting pressure on the Germanic tribes.

This resulted in wars between the Romans and the Germanic tribes - and between the Germanic peoples themselves.

Archaeologists assume the recent finds at the Alken dig stem from such an internal conflict.

The 200 dead were thrown into a peat bog near the village of Alken on the Jutland peninsula and only discovered by archaeologists two years ago.

Professor Mads Kahler Holst, of Aarhus University, said: 'We have found a wooden stick bearing the pelvic bones of four different men.

'In addition, we have unearthed bundles of bones, bones bearing marks of cutting and scraping, and crushed skulls.

'Our studies reveal that a violent sequel took place after the fallen warriors had lain on the battlefield for around six months.'

The remains of the fallen were gathered together and all the flesh was cleaned from the bones - which were then brutally desecrated before being cast into the lake.

Cuts and slashes on the skeletons showed they had died violently.

The warriors' bones at the bottom of the water-filled pit which kept them well-preserved were mixed with the remains of slaughtered animals and clay pots that probably contained food sacrifices.

Professor Holst said: 'We are fairly sure this was a religious act.

Bundles of bones, bones bearing marks of cutting and scraping, and crushed skulls were also found at the site

'It seems this was a holy site for a pagan religion - a sacred grove - where the victorious conclusion of major battles was marked by the ritual presentation and destruction of the bones of the vanquished warriors.'

Geological studies have revealed back in the Iron Age bodies were thrown into the water from the end of a tongue of land that stretched out into Mosso lake which was much larger than it is today.

Dr Ejvind Hertz, curator of Skanderborg Museum, said: 'Most of the bones we find here are spread out over the lake bed seemingly at random - but the new finds have suddenly given us a clear impression of what actually happened.

'This applies in particular to the four pelvic bones.

The warriors' bones at the bottom of the water-filled pit which kept them well-preserved were mixed with the remains of slaughtered animals and clay pots that probably contained food sacrifices.

'They must have been threaded onto the stick after the flesh was cleaned from the skeletons.'
