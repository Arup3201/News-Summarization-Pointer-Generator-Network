A man condemned as the nation’s most feckless father has boasted about how he dodged jail after beating up his ex-girlfriend and their young daughter in a row over sunglasses.

Keith MacDonald, 28, who is said to have 11 children with ten different mothers, was spared a prison sentence yesterday for assaulting Clare Bryant and Paige, three.

The court heard how MacDonald kicked and punched 24-year-old Miss Bryant and hit their daughter’s head with a fridge door.

But magistrates took pity on the 
unemployed drifter after hearing that he ‘wanted to change his life 
around’ and ‘needed their help’.

Outside court however, he was 
unrepentant,  boasting that he was innocent and had lied to avoid jail. 
‘I pleaded guilty to get out of jail,’ he said. ‘If I plead guilty, I 
won’t go. I didn’t do it – I didn’t touch her.
‘I’m happy about not going to jail. It gives me a chance to get my life back on track.’

MacDonald says he has slept with more
 than 40 women and first became a father when he was just 15. Miss 
Bryant was the eighth woman he made pregnant after he met her while 
drunk at a bus stop. Yesterday, magistrates in  Sunderland heard how he 
beat up the 24-year-old when he went to her home in Houghton-le-Spring 
in June this year.

Paul Doney, prosecuting, described 
how MacDonald came round to drop off some money while the victim was 
with her daughters, Paige and Chloe, aged two.

‘She asked him to go away, then he asked for his sunglasses and was asked to stay where he was while she got them,’ he said.

‘He tried to push past her, then 
grabbed her hair and pulled her down before kicking her in the face and 
punching her to the head. He was pushed back towards the yard as a 
neighbour shouted at them.’

MacDonald, of Sunderland, then threw 
the fridge door open, hitting Paige on the back of the head. The child 
suffered a sore head while her mother sustained a graze and a cut lip.

MacDonald’s lawyer, Gavin Sword, told
 the court that his client wanted to change his life around. ‘He doesn’t
 enjoy getting himself in these situations and being punished,’ said Mr 
Sword.

‘He appears willing to engage in work and is addressing his abusive behaviour in relationships.’
MacDonald pleaded guilty to assault by beating and assault at a previous
 hearing and was yesterday sentenced to 20 weeks in jail, suspended for 
two years.

He has other convictions for violent 
crimes and was ordered to attend a ‘building better relationships 
programme’ plus carry out unpaid work. He is banned from seeing Miss 
Bryant and her daughter except through arrangement by a solicitor and 
will have to pay her £100 compensation.

Peter Devere, the presiding magistrate, said there were was ‘no mitigation’ for the offence but added: ‘We feel you need help.’

However, the sentencing left Miss 
Bryant furious. ‘It just makes me angry,’ she said. ‘I’m more worried 
for my kids than for me – no one knows what he’s capable of.’

She said the court’s decision to 
place MacDonald on a building relationships programme was ‘ridiculous’. 
‘He has had the opportunity to get help for years and he’s turned it 
down year after year after year,’ she said.

MacDonald said afterwards he had 
decided not to have any more children and claimed that the true number 
was eight – not 11. ‘That’s enough,’ he said. ‘I don’t want the hassle 
of having more.’

Asked how much he pays in child maintenance, he added: ‘I don’t know, it just comes out of my benefits before they arrive.’

MacDonald claims he will soon start a
 job leafleting but currently lives on £44 a week income support and is 
said to pay just £5 a week towards the upkeep of his children.

He and Miss Bryant became engaged 
soon after they met but split long before Paige was born in April 2010. 
They had a second child, Chloe – which Miss Bryant described as a 
‘one-night blip’ – but they are no longer together.
