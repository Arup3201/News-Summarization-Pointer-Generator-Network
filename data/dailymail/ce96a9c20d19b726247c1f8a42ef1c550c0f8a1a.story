Nikki Bailey had been visiting her best friend in hospital when she arrived home as the workers for the repossession company were leaving.

Speaking to WSAZ news, she said: 'Everything was gone. Living room furniture, my Marshall 
diploma, my high school diploma, my pictures -- my history.'

The company quickly realised it had had made a mistake and was at the wrong house.

But by this point it was too late and all of her belongings had been taken to a rubbish dump.

The repossession company had been told by a bank to remove everything from a house on
 Godby Heights in Logan. Mrs Bailey lives on Godby Street, Godby Heights in Chapmanville.

Mistake: This map shows Mrs Bailey's house and the location of the house the repossession firm should have attended

Bare: Her house had been completely gutted with only a few items remaining

A lawyer is now working on the case to try and ensure Mrs Bailey is fully compensated for all of the items which she has lost.

Mrs
 Bailey's attorney Tim DiPiero said: 'It just seems kind of ridiculous 
that this actually happened when a phone call could have stopped it.'

He is now attempting to work out how the mistake was made.

Although the repossession company went to the wrong house, the address it was given by the bank was not correct.

Error: Clothes were also removed from her wardrobes

Mistake: The repossession company had gone to the wrong house
