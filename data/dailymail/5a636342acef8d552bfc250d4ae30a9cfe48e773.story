Lee Rigby will be handed a posthumous tribute normally reserved only for soldiers killed on active duty, it was reported today.

The 25-year-old British soldier, who was hacked to death on Wednesday afternoon in Woolwich, south-east London, will have his name carved onto the stone walls of the Armed Forces Memorial.

Defence secretary Philip Hammond and military chiefs have decided that Drummer Rigby should be remembered on the roll of honour at the National Memorial Arboretum near Lichfield, Staffordshire.

‘It is only right that Drummer Rigby 
should be accorded the same recognition as those who have fallen in the 
line of duty,’ a senior defence source told The Sunday Times.

The
memorial already holds the names of the 11 soldiers killed by the 1982 
IRA bombings in Hyde Park and Regent’s Park in central London.

Also
remembered on it are the two off-duty soldiers who were fatally shot 
four years ago outside Massereene Barracks in Antrim, Northern Ireland.

The
decision to commemorate Drummer Rigby on the 140ft-diameter memorial 
comes because he was killed in a terrorist attack, reported the 
newspaper.

The soldier, who
joined the Army in 2006 and was a Manchester United fan, had served in 
Helmand province, Afghanistan, where he was a member of the Fire Support
Group in Patrol Base Woqab.

He had also stood outside the Royal Palaces as part of his battalion's public duties commitment.

It also emerged this week that a tour Rigby was on in Afghanistan had to be cut short two months early after he developed kidney stones and had to be evacuated, reported The Sunday Times.

When he arrived back in Britain he visited the mother of Simon Valentine, a fellow soldier who died in Afghanistan during heavy fighting with the Taliban in summer 2009.

Carol Valentine, of Bedworth, Warwickshire, told The Sunday Times: ‘They might have gone out there as boys but they came home as men.’

Drummer Rigby was later pictured at a charity ball in full ceremonial uniform with Sgt Valentine’s baby nephew - named Simon in his honour.

Service of remembrance: Southwark Cathedral, London's oldest cathedral, may host Lee Rigby's funeral

Meanwhile it emerged that Drummer Rigby may be honoured with a funeral at Southwark Cathedral.

The
young soldier’s brutal death has brought calls for the celebration of 
his life to be a fitting tribute, and it is expected that hundreds of 
his friends and comrades will want to bid him farewell.

Southwark,
because of its size and proximity to Drummer Rigby’s barracks in 
Woolwich, would be ‘an appropriate and fitting venue for such an 
occasion,’ said a church source.

Such a large ceremony would provide a poignant illustration of the nation’s support for the soldier.

With
so many of his comrades, friends and relatives wanting to attend his 
funeral, a large church will needed and 1,500 mourners could fit inside 
Southwark Cathedral, believed to be the capital’s oldest, dating back to
606AD.

Prayers were said for murdered Drummer Lee Rigby today at church services in the community he lived in and the rest of the country.

The Sunday service at St Mary Magdalene 
Parish Church in Woolwich, just a few streets away from where he was 
brutally attacked was dedicated to the young father.

The Reverend Jesse van der Valk offered reassurance to the 50-strong congregation and spoke of the hope that had come out of the tragedy.

He likened the effect the attack has had on the community as to when Stephen Lawrence was killed in Eltham, just a few miles away from Woolwich.

After the hour-long service, where prayers were said for the soldier and his family, Mr van der Valk said: ‘I feel there are a number of feelings that have been coming out during the week.

‘There is certainly a feeling of rage and anger about what's happened, both locally and nationally, especially against those who've done this. But that's not the only feeling.

‘Clearly there's a great sense of sadness about what happened to Drummer Rigby. Everyone is very sad and upset, both here and all around the country.

'The local people here feel he was a member of their community and there has been a real outpouring of love and concern, as can be seen by the flowers.

‘He was a young father with a partner and a child and they identify with that, and there is a very obvious sense of sympathy with his family and friends and comrades.

‘We've also seen real acts of love and heroism this week, especially from the lady who stood up to the killer and the two ladies who prayed for Lee as he was lying on the ground.’

He also spoke of the sense of community as people from all faiths have come together to support one another.

Mr van der Valk said he had felt ‘privileged’ that many of Drummer Rigby's fellow soldiers at the barracks at had come to the church on Thursday evening, the day after the attack, for a quiet period of reflection and prayer.

Churchgoers spoke of their shock at the killing, with one saying he feared the backlash that has happened as a result of it.

Fred Okine, 62, said: ‘I think that what happened is not a reflection of somebody's faith, it's because they have something psychologically wrong.

‘The people who are stirring up trouble now are from outside the community, people here just want peace. They want revenge but who do they take revenge out on - Muslims? Black people?

‘I've lived in Woolwich for more than 25 years but this is frightening, and my daughter worries about me going out.’
