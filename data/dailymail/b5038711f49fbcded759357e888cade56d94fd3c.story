Rutgers President Robert Barchi is facing further calls for his resignation following the latest abuse scandal at the university's athletic program.

Julie Hermann, who was hired as Rutgers' athletic director on May 15, quit her job at Tennessee 16 years ago over accusations that she put her volleyball team through a storm of humiliation and fear, a scathing report has claimed.

Now, prominent New Jersey politicians, including former Governor Richard Codey, have demanded that Barchi steps down. Current Governor Chris Christie is said to be considering the issue.

Under the microscope: Julie Hermann, Rutgers' new athletic director, says she doesn't remember the letter that accused her of taking jabs at her former volleyball players' weight, and calling them whores and learning disabled

'A great university with great students and alumni deserve better,' Codey said.

The Star-Ledger reported on Saturday night that all 15 of the Tennessee team members said Hermann called them 'whores, alcoholics and learning disabled.'

They wrote: 'It has been unanimously decided that this is an irreconcilable issue.'

'The mental cruelty that we as a team 
have suffered is unbearable,' the players said about Hermann, 
Rutgers' new athletic director who had served as the No. 2 
athletic administrator at Louisville.

Democrat State Senator and former Governor Codey told the paper: 'This is becoming Comedy Central.

'It's an embarrassment to the students and alumni of a great 
university and it's time Mr. Barchi take his show on the road.'

Current Governor Christie said on Sunday that he would speak to Rutgers officials about the controversial athletics department but didn't call for any resignations.

Axed: Former Rutgers coach Mike Rice was fired on April 3 after a video emerged of him shoving players and berating them with insults and gay slurs

'Listen, I'm as curious as anybody 
and given my position, I get to ask questions more quickly than others,'
Christie said. 'So I'll be asking questions and we'll see what 
happens.'

State Senator Raymond Lesniak also spoke out against Barchi and claimed that Rutgers' former president, Richard McCormick, should return to the school.

'I've had problems with Barchi before
this. He's just in over his head and not capable of giving a forthright
answer,' Lesniak said, according to the New York Daily News.

The 49-year-old Hermann, set to take over the Rutgers' program June 17, told The Star-Ledger she didn't remember the letter.

The newspaper said that when it was read to her by phone Wednesday, she replied, 'Wow.'

Hermann, the first woman to head Rutgers' athletic program and one of three female ADs at the 124 schools that make up college football's top tier, has promised a restart for the program following the ouster of its men's basketball coach and the resignation of other officials.

She is set to replace Tim Pernetti, who quit last month after the firing of basketball coach Mike Rice.

Investigations: Governor Chris Christie says he'll be 'asking questions and see what happens'

Angry: The video, which was screened by ESPN, showed several moments when Mr Rice angrily pushed, shoved and grabbed his players during practices

Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move

The video showed numerous clips of Rice firing basketballs at players, hitting them in the back, legs, feet and shoulders.

It also showed him grabbing players by their jerseys and yanking them around the court. Rice can also be heard yelling obscenities and using anti-gay slurs.

The controversy went public in April when ESPN aired the videos and Rutgers President Robert Barchi admitted he didn't view the video in the fall.

Rice was fired and Pernetti, assistant 
coach Jimmy Martelli and interim senior vice president and university 
counsel John Wolf resigned.

Whistleblower: The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012

Anger: In this clip, Mr Rice, in white, is seen gesturing aggressively towards one of the Rutgers players

Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!'Â 

After a series of interviews with many of the former Tennessee players about Hermann, The Star-Ledger said: 'Their accounts depict a coach who thought nothing of demeaning them, who would ridicule and laugh at them over their weight and their performances, sometimes forcing players to do 100 sideline pushups during games, who punished them after losses by making them wear their workout clothes inside out in public or not allowing them to shower or eat, and who pitted them against one another, cutting down particular players with the whole team watching, and through gossip.

'Several women said playing for Hermann had driven them into depression and counseling, and that her conduct had sullied the experience of playing Division I volleyball.'

The Star-Ledger asked Hermann about the players' lingering grievances.

'I never heard any of this, never name-calling them or anything like that whatsoever,' she told the newspaper. 'None of this is familiar to me.'

Rutgers will join the Big Ten in 2014.
