A conman who was caught in a sting on the TV show Cowboy Builders has been jailed for five years after ripping off a string of customers for more than £370,000.

Builder John Guerin, who featured on the Channel 5 show presented by Dominic Littlewood in January 2011, was jailed at Croydon Crown Court after pleading guilty to 10 charges of fraud and one of obtaining money by deception.

The court heard how the 56-year-old, from Biggin Hill, Kent, targeted vulnerable people and that after starting work, he convinced customers to hand over as much cash as possible before he vanished.

Guerin's tactics saw him try to get 'at least' 90 per cent of the quoted price before he did a runner - leaving dozens of homes across London in a 'state of ruin' and in need of emergency structural work between 2006 and 2010.

Many of the homes he targeted were left with gaping holes in walls, skips lying full and unpaid for in the driveway, and dodgy electrics and plumbing.

Some were left in such a dangerous condition they were in peril of collapsing and homeowners had to stump up tens of thousands to get professional builders in to complete the job before they could move back in.

The court also heard how many owners had to re-mortgage their homes in order to pay for builders to come in and fix Guerin's shoddy work.

Many of Guerin's crimes took place in the London Borough of Bromley.

After he was jailed, Bromley Borough Council released photos of some of his shoddy building work.

The council said Guerin traded under a range of company names, including Bluewood Constructions Ltd, Greyfox Project Management and Merlyn Refurbishment Ltd, before he was snared.

The council's trading standards department said Guerin employed the same tactic on most jobs, by giving homeowners a quote for the work and then demanding 90 per cent of the full amount before doing a runner.

In one case, Guerin was asked to build an extension for a man suffering from Parkinson's disease, but left with the project in a 'total mess' after getting more than £20,000.

Sentencing Guerin to five years in jail, Judge Heather Baucher said: 'It beggared belief that he would inflict such harm.

'Nothing will compensate the victims for the distress and misery caused.'

The court heard how the total amount paid by victims was £370,000 - but that with the increased costs of getting the job done properly meant victims would be 'left considerably out of pocket'.

Bromley Council added that it had made an application under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize Guerin's assets.

Councillor Tim Stevens said: 'We are delighted with the outcome of this case and the time is now conducting a financial investigation into any financial gains made so the council can seek to recover any sums that were overpaid.

'The outcome of this case sends out a very strong message that we will not tolerate criminals preying on Bromley residents and our trading standards team is doing everything humanly possible to make sure that the perpetrators of such crimes are brought to justice.'

During his appearance on Cowboy Builders, Guerin was challenged by Mr Littlewood about the quality of his workmanship.The show is co-presented by former glamour model Melinda Messenger.
