Obama administration officials told a gathering of all 100 U.S. Senators on Wednesday that they were kept in the dark about Saturday's prisoner swap because the Taliban warned that they would kill Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl if any information about the plan leaked to the public.

But Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the senior Republican member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, says he and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, his Democratic counterpart on the committee,  were told 'months and months' in advance when the Obama administration was planning to kill Osama bin Laden.

'It was like they didn't trust Dianne and me,' Chambliss said during an interview on the Fox News Channel, describing his frustration with being kept out of the loop on the Bergdahl hostage swap.

'And yet the two of us knew about the bin Laden event leading up to the takedown of bin Laden for months and months and months,' he said.

Yes to the al-Qaeda raid, no to the Taliban trade: Sen. Saxby Chambliss told Fox News that the Obama administration briefed him and other Senate Intelligence Committee leaders about the Osama bin Laden kill raid 'months' in advance, and there were no public leaks

Navy SEALS killed terror mastermind Osama bin Laden in his Pakistan bedroom in 2011; senators were briefed 'months and months' in advance, Chambliss said so finds it hard to fathom that he wasn't trusted with plans for Bergdahl's release (right)

'It's just very puzzling about why they didn't notify anyone in Congress about what was going on,' Chambliss added, referring to the negotiations for Bergdahl's release.

U.S. Navy SEALS killed bin Laden, the global leader of the al-Qaeda terror network, May 2, 2011 in a covert nighttime raid on his Abbottabad, Pakistan compound.

No information about that operation became public until President Barack Obama announced the news in a triumphant White House event.

The Associated Press first published an account of Wednesday's closed-door Senate meeting where lawmakers heard explanations from from the White House about why the Obama administration chose to carry out negotiations for Bergdahl's safe return in secret.

Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken delivered the presentation, according to two Senate staffers.

He told senators that that the administration moved quickly and sought no congressional approval for the release of five Taliban terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay prison because of the Taliban's death threat against Bergdahl if the deal wasn't kept quite.

A Senate Republican aide told MailOnline that few on Capitol Hill believe that rationale.

'It's a flimsy argument,' he said, requesting anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the press.

'We have an intelligence committee that meets in a hermetically sealed room. If you can't trust them with the most sensitive information about what the White House is up to, we may as well pack it in and become a monarchy.'

'It's just so much BS. Now we're all going to wonder even more what the White House isn't telling us.'

Big guns: Chambliss (L) is the Senate Intelligence Committee's vice-chair and ranking Republican while Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinsten (R) chairs the committee; then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised both that they would have 30 days' notice if anyone was transferred out of the Guantamano Bay prisoncamp

Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken briefed all 100 senators on Wednesday, citing a Taliban threat to execute Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl if negotiations were leaked to the public as the reason for a hurried prisoner exchange without putting Congress in the loop

The Fox News interview with Chambliss first aired Wednesday on Greta van Susteren's evening program, and portions were re-aired Thursday afternoon.

Van Susteren asked him if the White House also explained why the Senate wasn't notified about the 5-for-1 hostage trade 'five minutes before it went down.'

'I mean, why they didn't pick up the phone at the White House and call you and Senator Feinstein? It would have taken about 30 seconds.'

Chambliss was on the same page.

'That was my question to Tony [Blinken],' he responded.

'You guys knew this was going down several days out,' he recalled telling Blinken. 'Why didn't you pick up the phone, particularly since Secretary Clinton had written to Senator Feinstein and me and said, "We understand the law is we have to give you 30 days notice before the transfer of any Guantanamo detainee. We assure you we will give you that notice".'

'My comment back to the administration,' Chambliss concluded, 'is that I'm not gonna believe anything they tell me from now on. ... 'How in the world can we trust the administration on anything they tell us?'

Another Republican, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, demanded Thursday that Justice Department tell Congress whyis counseled the White House to move ahead with the Taliban trade in the absence of congressional input.

'Unfortunately, this is the latest instance in which the President has chosen to act unilaterally, without regard for Congressâ€™s role, and contrary to a law he recently signed,' Grassley wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder.

Obama signed the annual Defense Department authorization bill in December, which included the 30-day congressional notification requirement.

'The public deserves a full and transparent accounting of why the Administration believed it could disregard the law,' Grassley insisted.

Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss said he didn't believe the Obama administration's claim that fear of a leak prompted them to finalize the release of five terrorists from Guantanamo Bay without telling Congress

@highlight

Chambliss said he and Senate Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein 'knew about ... the takedown of [Osama] bin Laden for months and months and months'

@highlight

Nothing about the bin Laden kill raid was made public until President Obama announced at the White House that the al-Qaeda leader was dead

@highlight

Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told senators on Wednesday that the Taliban threatened to execute Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl if any news leaked about hostage-swap negotiations

That explanation, he said, justified ignoring a law that requires the White House to tell Congress 30 days before releasing anyone from Gitmo
