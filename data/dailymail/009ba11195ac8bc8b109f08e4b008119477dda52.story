Switzerland finally claimed their first points of Euro 2016 qualifying in a 4-0 rout of San Marino on Tuesday night, but the country's press were far from enthused.

After defeats against England and Slovenia in Group E, a double from Haris Seferovic and further goals from Blerim Dzemaili and Xherdan Shaqiri ensured Swiss victory in Serravalle.

Newspaper Blick moaned about the team scoring just four goals against the 'Dwarves' of San Marino, with only Seferovic getting a good rating.

Switzerland raced to a 4-0 victory over San Marino to claim their first Euro 2016 qualifying points but their performance in Serravalle failed to enthuse the Swiss press

Haris Seferovic, seen here scoring the first goal, was the only player to receive a good rating in Blick

The two-goal striker received a score of 5 from the paper, which equates to 'good' in their rating system.

All the others received either a 3 for 'weak' or 4 for 'good enough'. Shaqiri was singled out for particular criticism, with Blick saying he did not perform well enough despite a goal and an assist.

They add that Josip Drmic didn't have his shooting boots on, with all his efforts badly missing the target.

Ricardo Rodriguez also saw a penalty saved by San Marino goalkeeper Aldo Simoncelli in the last minute, the fifth penalty Switzerland have missed out of their last eight.

They also say Granit Xhaka, of Borussia Monchengladbach, jabbed his finger angrily towards the crowd when they whistled after an inaccurate Dzemaili pass failed to reach him.

The paper 20 Minuten was also underwhelmed, with its front page headline saying that Switzerland did their duty but didn't shine in the match.

They added that Switzerland barely showed up during the second half.

Tages-Anzeiger noted the lack of emotion when the players lined up to salute their travelling supporters at the final whistle.

Le Matin said Switzerland were far from convincing in their performance despite scoring four times

NZZ said the Swiss had done their duty but that the match was played out in a 'surreal ambience' comparable to the early rounds of the Swiss Cup.

Die Zeitung mentioned the highest-ever victory over San Marino, the 13-0 scoreline recorded by Germany in 2006, and said the Swiss might have come close to that had they not 'surrendered to the obvious lack of enthusiasm.'

French language journal Le Matin also said on its front page that Switzerland were far from convincing.
