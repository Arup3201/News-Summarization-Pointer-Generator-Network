The last time Nasa redesigned its astronauts spacesuits, the result looked like it had been inspired by Toy Story star Buzz Lightyear.

For its next model, Nasa is putting the decision-making process out to a public vote, and is asking people to choose from three protoypes.

Called Biomimicry, Technology, and Trends In Society the three suits have been inspired by nature, advances in space technology and how the agency thinks clothes of the future will look.

Nasa's Z-2 is the latest prototype in the agency's Z range of spacesuits, and will be the successor to the Z-1 model unveiled in 2012. Nasa has created three designs calls Biomimicry, pictured,Technology and Trends In Society and is asking the public to vote for their favourite

The Biomimicry suit was inspired by the 
ocean and has been designed to mirror ‘the bioluminescent qualities of 
aquatic creatures found at incredible depths, and the scaly skin of fish
 and reptiles found across the globe.’ 

The Technology suit ‘pays homage to spacesuit achievements of the past while incorporating subtle elements of the future’.

It
 is fitted with Luminex wire and patches that emit light to make it 
easier to identify crew members during spacewalks, for example.

The Trends in Society suit is ‘reflective of what every day clothes may look like in the not too distant future.’

It uses electroluminescent wire and a bright colour scheme to mimic the look of sportswear and wearable tech.

Nasa’s Z-2 is the latest prototype in the agency’s Z range of spacesuits, and will be the successor to the its green and white Z-1 model unveiled in 2012.

The Biomimicry suit was inspired by the ocean and has been designed to mirror ‘the bioluminescent qualities of aquatic creatures found at incredible depths, and the scaly skin of fish and reptiles found across the globe.’

Nasa said the design reflects the qualities that protect some of 'Earth's toughest creatures', and specifically includes segmented pleats at the shoulder, elbow, hip and knee.

It also features electroluminescent wire across the upper torso, which lights up in the dark.

The agency's Technology suit ‘pays homage to spacesuit achievements of the past while incorporating subtle elements of the future’.

It is fitted with Luminex wire, and patches that emit light to make it easier to identify crew members during spacewalks, for examples.

These patches are fitted to the upper and lower torso, alongside collapsing pleats that make movement easier. It also has abrasion resistant panels on the lower torso.

Meanwhile, the Trends in Society suit is ‘reflective of what every day clothes may look like in the not too distant future.’

It uses electroluminescent wire and a bright colour scheme to mimic the look of sportswear and wearable tech.

The design includes pleats with contrast stitching, plus electroluminescent wire and patches of varying styles across both the upper and lower torso.

The Z-2 will be made using 3D printed 
parts, while 3D human laser scans will be used to accurately size each 
suit to individual astronauts.

Voting closes on 15 April and the winning design will be put into production. The suit will then go through tests at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston. Technology prototype pictured

Despite claims it looked like a toy suit, Nasa's Z-1 suit, pictured, was named one of Time Magazine's Best Inventions of 2012

In a
 blog post, Nasa said: ‘As spacesuit engineers, [we] have found 
ourselves with an exciting opportunity: the chance to make a suit with a
 look unlike any suit ever built before.

‘The designs were created with the intent to protect the suit and to highlight certain mobility features to aid suit testing.

‘To take it a step further, we are leaving it up you, the public, to choose which of three candidates will be built.’

Voting closes on 15 April.

Nasa will then put the winning design into production before running it through tests at the Johnson Space Centre in Houston.

Technically, the Z-2 will be built to withstand and absorb impact, especially on the upper and lower torso.

Despite claims it looked like a toy suit, Nasa’s Z-1 suit was named one of Time Magazine's Best Inventions of 2012.

‘After the positive response to the Z-1 suit's visual design we received, we wanted to take the opportunity to provide this new suit with an equally memorable appearance,’ continued Nasa.

‘The cover layer of a prototype suit is important as it serves to protect the suit against abrasion and snags during the rigors of testing.

‘With the Z-2, we're looking forward to employing cover layer design elements never used in a spacesuit before. ‘

The designs were produced in collaboration with suit vendor ILC, and Philadelphia University.
