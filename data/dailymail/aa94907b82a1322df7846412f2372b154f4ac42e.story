The Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI) estimates there are approximately 1,500 acid attacks a year globally.

Acid violence is a worldwide phenomenon that is not restricted to a particular race, religion or geographical location.

It occurs in many countries in South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, the West Indies and the Middle East, and there is anecdotal evidence of attacks in other regions.

In many countries acid attacks constitute a hidden form of violence against women and children that often goes unreported, and the true number of horrific attacks taking place has only come to light after in-depth research.Source: Acid Survivors Trust International

Mr Hameed said no arrests had been made and the motive behind the crime was unclear.

Attacks
 on women have topped the national agenda recently since December 2012 
when a medical student was assaulted and raped by six men on a moving 
bus.

The attack in the heart of the Indian capital shocked a country often inured to such sexual violence.

It brought hundreds of thousands of angry citizens out in the streets to demand more safety for women and harsher laws to deter the perpetrators of such acts..

Many reported acid attackers are typically a husband or someone else close to the victim.

They receive minimal punishment from the state and cases being brought to court are rare.

Activists have asked that India should regulate the sale of an acid called Tezaab which is designed to clean rusted tools, but is commonly used in attacks as it is so freely available.

The Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI) estimates there are approximately 1,500 acid attacks a year globally.

The charity states acid violence is a worldwide phenomenon that is not restricted to a particular race, religion or geographical location.
