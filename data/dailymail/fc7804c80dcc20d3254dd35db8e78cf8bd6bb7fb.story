A Second World War veteran died minutes before he was to 
board a Stars and Stripes Honor flight to Washington.Â 

Walter Smith, from Racine, Wisconsin, had been diagnosed with colon cancer four years ago and 
the honor flight had been his motivation to work hard on his 
rehabilitation.

The flight provides veterans with free trips to visit monuments and the changing of the guard at Arlington National Ceremony.

Veteran: Walter Smith, 91, of Racine (centre) died on Saturday morning when he arrived at the Milwaukee airport to board a Stars and Stripes Honor Flight

About 100 World War II and Korean War-era veterans travelled Saturday on the flight.

Smith died the morning of June 8, shortly after his family arrived at the airport to drop him off for his flight, JSOnline.com reported.

When Smith became quiet on the drive to the airport, his family 
assumed he had fallen asleep.

But when they tried to
wake him up after arriving at the airport, they realised that something
was wrong. Smith died in an ambulance on the way to the hospital.

Hero: Mr Smith was a veteran of the D-Day landings in Normandy in 1944 (file picture)

'I really, truly believe the flight kept him hanging on for much 
longer,' his son Mark Smith told, JSOnline.com reported.

'He was extremely excited
about the whole trip. He definitely was looking forward to going. It 
was the driving force for him to get better.'

During the war, Smith was wounded and earned two Purple Hearts.

The medal is awarded for: 'Being wounded or killed in any action against an enemy of the United 
States or as a result of an act of any such enemy or opposing armed 
forces.'

His casket will be draped with an American flag, which will be taken on the next Stars and Stripes Honor Flight in September.
