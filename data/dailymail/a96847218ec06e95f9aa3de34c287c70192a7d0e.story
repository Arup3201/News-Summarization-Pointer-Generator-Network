Carole Middleton's svelte figure has been attributed to the Dukan diet

Millions are expected to turn to celebrity-led diets in a bid to shed weight gained over the festive break.

But a study suggests that trendy weight-loss techniques favoured by the stars are likely to end in failure.

Findings show the average 'crash' diet lasts just 15 
days and 35 per cent say they end up putting on more weight than they lost in the first place, with an average 4.7 pounds creeping back on post-diet.

The Dukan diet, said to be followed by the Duchess of Cambridge's mother Carole Middleton, Jennifer Lopez and Gisele Bundchen, involves cutting out various food groups and has become increasingly popular over recent years.

Meanwhile the low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet Atkins diet remains a favourite despite mixed reviews.

However a poll of 2,000 women conducted by Hovis Wholemeal bread suggests that a balanced diet is a more effective way of losing weight in the long-term.

Commenting on the study Olympic cyclist Victoria Pendleton said: 'It's worrying to think that 
women put pressure on themselves to lose weight quickly and then suffer 
emotional repercussions if they give up or don't see the desired 
results.

'The secret to a healthy lifestyle is not crash diets.'

She added that increasing the amount of exercise will allow dieters to eat more of what they want without packing on any extra weight.

Nearly half (48 per cent) of the women questioned said their failed dieting attempts came from trying to cut out 
all savoury snacks and one in three (33 per cent) women tried to remove all 
bread from their diet.

The majority of Brits notice the 
pounds piling on 22 days after their diets end and only one in 
five women successfully reach their target weight.

In November the British Dietetic Association issued its annual list of the five worst celebrity diets to avoid in the New Year.

Experts named the Dukan Diet, which 
works on restricting foods, calories and portion control as the worst 
celebrity weight loss plan to follow and said it has 'absolutely no 
solid science behind it at all'.

Unrealistic: Many women questioned said their failed dieting attempts came from following plans that were too restrictive

The BDA receives hundreds of calls 
every year on the subject of diets and analysed results to form a list 
of the most unreliable, difficult to follow or unhealthy diet plans.

Sian Porter, consultant dietician and 
spokesperson for the BDA, said of weight loss fads: 'Sadly, there is no 
magic wand you can wave.

'If you have some weight you need to 
lose, then do it in a healthy, enjoyable and sustainable way. In the 
long term this will achieve the results you are after.

'Glamorous images of celebrities saturate our daily media in all forms.

'A lot of these images are airbrushed and retouched to give celebrities
 an unachievable body image that does not exist in real life, yet many 
aspire to.'

Hovis has now launched a Facebook campaign called 'Stop snacking, start moving' to help women diet successfully.
