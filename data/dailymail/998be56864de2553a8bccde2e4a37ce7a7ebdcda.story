A San Diego lawyer representing a second city employee to come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against former Mayor Bob Filner has released an unsettling computer animation showing the politician putting the woman in a headlock.

Attorney Daniel Gilleon said he plans to introduce the two-minute computer-generated clip as evidence in a lawsuit filed by his client Stacey McKenzie.

According to Gilleon, the cartoon accurately depicts his client's bizarre encounter with then-Mayor Filner at the Clairmont Day as the Bay event April 21.

Cartoon: Attorney Daniel Gilleon produced this 2-minute computer-generated clip reenacting an encounter that took place between his client Stacey McKenzie (left) and former San Diego Mayor Bob Filner (right)

Hands-on mayor: In the clip, Filner's character asks McKenzie if she has a significant other, and upon learning that she's single, he asks her out on a lunch date and grabs her wrists

The news comes a day after Filner was sentenced to home confinement for the unwanted groping of women.

The animation begins with Miss McKenzie, 50, a long-time manager in the Park and Recreation Department, introducing herself to Filner.

After thanking her for her 32 years of service, the 71-year-old mayor asks McKenzie her if she has a husband or boyfriend.

The woman indicates that she is not in a relationship. In response, the mayor asks McKenzie for her business card, saying that he would like to take her out to lunch.

‘Just to make this clear, this is not a business lunch. This is a date. I’m asking you out on a date,’ the animated Filner says with a smile as he grabs McKenzie’s wrists.

Beeline: This graphic in the video shows Filner following McKenzie across the park after their conversation

Siganture move: The cartoon mayor surprises McKenzie from behind in the recreation and puts his arm around her head and chest in what has come to be known as the ‘Filner headlock'

Spine-chilling: The animated mayor tells a terrified-looking McKenzie, 'Just so you know, I like to get really close to my city employees'

Visual aid: McKenzie's attorney is hoping to show the animation to the jury as evidence

The video turns even creepier when the cartoon mayor is shown making a beeline for McKenzie as she is retelling the story of her odd conversation with him to her colleagues on the other side of the park.

The animated mayor surprises McKenzie from behind and puts his arm around her head and chest in what has come to be known as the ‘Filner headlock.’

'Isn't she great? Isn’t she great? I'm mentoring her. I'm thinking of making her employee of the day,' Filner says in the clip. 'Just so you know, I like to get really close to my city employees.'

He then tells McKenzie's terrified-looking character: 'Stacey, you are turning really red.'

Serious allegations: McKenzie is suing Filner and the city for $500,000, claiming gender violence, sexual harassment, battery and failure to prevent sexual harassment

Show and tell: Miss McKenzie standing next to her lawyer shows reporters how Mayor Filner allegedly put her in a headlock during the April event

The city manager responds by telling the mayor that he is embarrassing her, drawing a spine-chilling cackle from Filner.

McKenzie's attorney told Fox5 that the animation helps tell his client's story, even though he noted that the current version downplays some aspects of the incident, including the intensity of the headlock and Filner's elbow allegedly rubbing Miss McKenzie's breasts.

Gilleon expects Filner's defense team to try and supress the animation if the case goes to trial.

McKenzie’s lawsuit, filed Wednesday in
San Diego County Superior Court, alleges gender violence, sexual 
harassment, battery and failure to prevent sexual harassment. She is 
seeking $500,000 in damages.

The
50-year-old accuser said in August that it was Filner's farewell 
speech, in which he denied ever harassing any women, that convinced her
to pursue legal action, 10News reported.

Say cheese: Filner, here smiling at his defense team at his Monday sentencing, pleaded not guilty to harassment charges after a drawn out public humiliation saw the former congressman accused by nearly 20 women. Now he'll walk away without serving any jail time

Accusers: They included 
the first to publicly point the finger at Filner, Irene McCormack 
Jackson (center); Michelle Tyler, a nurse who claims Filner made 
inappropriate advances on her while she was seeking help for a disabled 
Marine (left) and great-grandmother Peggy Shannon (right)

'He was trying to downplay what happened to us,' she told the radio station KOGO at the time. 'It said you [his accusers] are liars.'

The lawsuit is the second to be filed against Filner His former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson, is seeking $1.5million from him and the city.

Filner resigned August 30 after being accused by nearly 20 women of grabbing and harassing them. He begins his sentence of three months home confinement in January.
