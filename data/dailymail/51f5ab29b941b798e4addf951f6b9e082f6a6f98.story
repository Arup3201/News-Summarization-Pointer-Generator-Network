Stuart Kerner, 44,  has been accused of having a sexual relationship with a former pupil, but today said the girl had invented the story

An R.E. teacher accused of having an 18-month affair with a former pupil  today told a court that the alleged victim is a 'vain stalker' who made the relationship up.

Stuart Kerner, 44, the married vice principal of Bexleyheath Academy, is accused of having a sexual relationship with a former pupil.

But today jurors at his trial were told the girl, now aged 19, is a 'psychopathic liar' who  thought 'everyone fancies her.'

The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, claims that during her relationship with Kerner, which began when she was 15, the pair had sex 'all over' the school.

She told jurors that Kerner took her virginity in one of the store cupboards, and claimed he had once taken her for a day-long sex session at his home while his wife at work.

But at the Inner London Crown Court today, Kerner argued that the girl had stalked him, and used details gleaned from calendars, computers and gadgets in his office to construct her fantasy.

Kerner's defence barrister Edward Ellis  said: 'He's a man who didn't look behind his back, and he was stalked, and information was found out about him for this carefully constructed elaborate ruse.

'Why? We don't know, it's not up to the defence to prove.' 

Marion King, a librarian at the school, also gave evidence to support Kerner's account, calling the girl a liar, and saying that she used to take Kerner's iPad to play games on.

In court today Kerner also denied buying a Fifty Shades of Grey keychain - based on the erotic novel - for the female student, saying it was a 'joke present for his wife instead. 

He also denied carrying condoms in his suit jacket at the school, saying his wife would have noticed as she often hung up his jacket and removed things from the pockets. 

The court had previously heard that the girl had  lied about being in a car accident to skip school.

Mr Ellis added: 'This particular lie, of the accident, was so elaborate it fooled people for weeks, even her friends didn't know about it, even her mum didn't know about it.

'It's not pleasant to talk about [the girl] in terms of being a liar, but the issue really is a credibility point.'

The alleged victim, who cannot be identified, said Kerner took her virginity in school cupboard when she was 16, after which they had sex 'all over' Bexleyheath Academy where he was vice principal

The girl claims that her relationship with Kerner began when she was 15-years-old after they became close, spending time in the school library where she had volunteered since Year 9.

According to prosecutors the girl's intimate knowledge of Kerner's private life, including birthdays and the fact he always wore a crucifix under his work attire, point to th truth of her claims.

However defence barristers argue that the crucifix detail came from a photo of the teacher and his son kept in his office.

The girl also claimed that, after seeing the teacher undressed, she noticed a scar on his back.

However, it was argued he told her about the scar when he gave her sympathy following her false claims that she had been injured in a car crash.

In an interview with police the girl claimed the pair slept with each other in the same week that his wife, Katy, suffered a miscarriage in late 2012. 

Mr Ellis said his client knew nothing of the allegations against him until the police interviewed him.

He said: 'The police went through all the allegations with him, and of course how can you answer something you know nothing about. He has nothing to hide, nothing at all.'

The jury heard Kerner was born in South London and was bought up 'not far' from Inner London Crown Court, went to King's College London to study a course in divinity and theology and had considered being ordained.

Kerner also denied buying a Fifty Shades of Grey keychain for the girl, saying instead the he had bought it as a 'joke' present for his wife Katy (pictured right)

Mr Ellis said; 'He was going to be ordained, but he didn't take it, and went into teaching.' 

Kerner has told of how he met the girl while taking a statement from her in the school library over accusations that her mother had been assaulting her.  

He told the court that he had taken a statement from the girl on behalf of the child protection officer at the school, but that was his 'last involvement' in that situation.

He denies two counts of sexual activity with a child and six counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust.

The trial continues.
