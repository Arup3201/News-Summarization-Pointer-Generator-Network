Pulling teeth can be painful but this brave child goes at it full throttle. 

Little Striker Stanger from Harrisville, Utah, attached a piece of string to a milk tooth and tethered it to his remote control car. 

He then accelerated the vehicle at full speed with the wince-worthy stunt caught on camera.

At the beginning of the video, Striker's mother asks him to explain what he's doing.

'I'm going to take this remote, the truck's going to go all the way forward to dad . . . and I'm going to see if I can pull my tooth out,' he calmly replies. 

Striker then gears up to do the deed, exclaiming: 'OK. Ready, set, booster ignition!'

The youngster presses the ignition button on his remote while he sits with his mouth wide open.
