When the simple act of walking up and down the stairs made Caroline Kupfers feel as if she was going to have a heart attack, she knew it was time to do something about her weight.

The secretary from Scunthorpe feared that at 19st 13lb she wouldn't live to see her daughter grow up and even considered gastric bypass surgery.

But after going on a meal replacement diet, in which she swapped food for shakes, the 33-year-old lost 10st, boosted her confidence and says her marriage is now even stronger.

After years of yo-yo dieting, Caroline feared she wouldn't be around to see her daughter Nikita, 10, grow up

The secretary had always considered herself a 'big girl', even from a young age. 

She said: 'I remember being bigger as far back as I remember and was always trying to lose the weight some way or another. I tried Weight Watchers, Rosemary Conley, Slimming World, the Cambridge Diet Plan but none of them seemed to work.

'I managed to lose 6st before I had my daughter but as soon as I became pregnant the weight crept back on.

'The turning point for me was when I couldn't even walk back and forth up the stairs without feeling I was going to collapse and die.  

Worried her 19st 13lb frame meant she wouldn't live to see her daughter grow up, Caroline considered having gastric bypass surgery.

Scared of going under the knife she decided to give dieting one last shot, opting for a drastic meal replacement programme alongside attending support groups.

Caroline went on a series of diets and even considered a gastric band before she finally slimmed down

Caroline ditched junk food and unhealthy snacks during her low-calorie diet and dropped nine dress sizes

'It was LighterLife or a gastric bypass and LighterLife seemed a lot less scary in comparison,' she explained. 

Caroline undertook the Total Programme in which  conventional food is replaced by a nutritionally complete called the Very Low Calorie Diet (VLCD) provided in four 'foodpacks'  a day.

She also attended LighterLife's behaviour change programme which involved attending weekly counselling groups to help her understand the real reasons for her overeating.  

Previously Caroline's diet consisted mainly of junk food, with constant snacking on fatty and salty foods like  chocolate and crisps.

She said: 'At lunch I would never have a packed lunch. I would always go to Greggs or buy a sandwich, with crisps, a sausage roll and sometimes a cake.

'There would be sweets and biscuits in the office and I would have crisps and chocolate bars while I was at my daughter's dancing class.

At her peak weight of 19st 13lb Caroline was terrified of going on fairground rides, fearing she'd get stuck

'After that it would be late, and I'd often order a pizza. When you're tired it is easy to just have a takeaway or chippy.

'It can also be about what you drink, and I used to go out every weekend and drink blue WKD.'

After 10 months on the programme, cutting out food entirely, Caroline had lost an incredible 10st, dropping from a size 28 to a size 10.

She then gradually began to reintroduced healthy conventional food. 

Caroline explained the effect her size had on her family.

She said: 'My mum, especially, was always worried about my health due to my size. She is so proud of me that I have lost the weight and am healthier and happier.

'My husband and daughter, Nikita, also couldn't be prouder. Nikita loves that Mummy can now jump up and down on the trampoline with her and run around with the dog.' 

Now a shadow of her former self Caroline says she has more energy to play with her daughter 

'One of the best and most significant factors in losing the weight has got to be my increase in confidence. Everyday activities and fun days out were so difficult. 

'Whenever we would go to a theme park I wouldn't dare even try and get on any of the rides through fear that I would get stuck or I would break it. 

'If anything my weight loss has made my marriage even stronger as my husband has been just so supportive.

'He was so good not to rub my face in it while I was on the programme and never cooked meals in front of me. I would never cook before as I was so tired and seemed to live on pizza but now we cook the meals together as a family.'

Breakfast: A yoghurt, fruit and a cereal bar 

Lunch: Sandwich, with crisps, a sausage roll and sometimes a cake

Dinner: Takeaway pizza or chip shop meal 

Snacks: Biscuits, sweets, crisps and chocolate

Breakfast: A yoghurt and fruit 

Lunch: A salad with lean protein like chicken or tuna

Dinner: Homemade soups or a jacket potato with protein and vegetables 

Snacks: None 

'I now walk everywhere and even cycle. And even better I have started dancing again, an activity that I forgot how much I loved, and it's even with my old dance teacher.' 

Caroline's counsellor Natalie says of her phenomenal weight loss: 'Caroline is just a completely different person to when I first met her. Her confidence has risen tenfold and it is so lovely to see her so happy and healthy.

'I think part of the reason she has been so successful is the determination she had throughout her ten months on the programme. 

'This time she was going to lose the weight and 10 stone later she certainly did it.'
