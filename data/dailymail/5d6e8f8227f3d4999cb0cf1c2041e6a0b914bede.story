Labour has given its blessing to a walkout by thousands of teachers this week, despite warnings that it will ‘inflict real harm’ on children and their parents.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt refused three times yesterday to condemn the planned National Union of Teachers strike on Thursday, which is expected to bring chaos to thousands of schools.

The strike is backed by Labour’s three biggest donors – the Unite, Unison and GMB unions – which are planning  co-ordinated walkouts.

Mr Hunt faced criticism from the unions earlier this year for crossing a university picket line to deliver a lecture.

But yesterday he refused to offer any support to teachers wishing to cross picket lines on Thursday to teach their pupils.

Mr Hunt said the long-running dispute over pay and pensions was the result of a ‘political failure’.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that the ‘incendiary language’ of Education Secretary Michael Gove was partly to blame for provoking  the walkout.

And he repeatedly refused to condemn the strikes: ‘My message is that we have an independent system of trade unions.

'It’s not up to me to tell trade 
unionists what to do.’ Mr Gove called on Mr Hunt to issue a ‘clear and 
unambiguous’ statement urging teachers to work on Thursday.

He said: ‘The thing that really 
worried me is that he was not clear about the need for teachers to be in
 the classroom and not striking on Thursday.

‘No teacher should be on strike – he should be encouraging teachers who want to work.’

The clash came as the Conservatives 
revealed plans to force union bosses to re-ballot their members each 
year during long-running disputes.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude 
said it was unacceptable that the NUT is able to threaten chaos at 
thousands of schools based on a ballot held almost two years ago.

The NUT mandate dates back to a ballot held between June and September 2012.

Although strike action was backed by 82.5 per cent of those who voted, the turnout was just 27 per cent.

The Tories are examining plans to require a minimum 50 per cent turnout threshold on ballots before a strike is deemed legal.

Senior Conservatives have been pushing for the move for some time, but it has been blocked by Nick Clegg and will now form part of the next Tory manifesto.

Mr Maude said the introduction of minimum turnout thresholds was now a ‘live issue’.

He added: ‘We should also be looking at whether there should be some rule that a mandate falls after a certain time.’

Just 20 per cent of union members voted in some of the ballots.

Mr Maude said it was ‘a sign of a great lack of self-confidence that [the NUT] aren’t willing to ask for a fresh mandate for action’.

The move will infuriate trade unionists who claim existing strike laws already make ballots expensive and difficult to carry out.
