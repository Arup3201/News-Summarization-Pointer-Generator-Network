A drug addict who killed three people when he sped through a red light has been jailed for 16 years, prompting victims' families to call for harsher sentences for ice-fuelled crimes.

Nei Lima Da Costa was travelling at about 120km/h when he struck Anthony Parsons as he crossed a Melbourne intersection, before smashing into a car and killing couple Savvas and Ismini Menelaou.

Tests found ice in the 30-year-old's system and witnesses described seeing a 'white blur' as he weaved through traffic and ran red lights moments before the January crash. 

Ice addict Nei Lima Da Costa has been jailed for 16 years for reckless driver after he killed three people

Victorian Supreme Court Justice Lex Lasry said he struggled to comprehend a more serious example of deadly driving, as he jailed Lima Da Costa for 16 years, with a minimum 11-year term.

The Menelaous' son, Jim Menelaou, said the punishment did not fit the crime.

'Sixteen to serve and 11 minimum, to us it doesn't make sense how those numbers are put on people's lives,' he said outside court on Wednesday.

'We've lost our parents, our dearly loved ones. No sentence will ever change anything or bring them back, but what we want from the government is to create change.

'A lot of red tape prohibits the courts from setting examples or setting a serious sentence.'

Justice Lasry said Lima Da Costa's crime had not been caused by a momentary lapse of concentration, but was a reckless joy-ride that was bound to end in tragedy.

'This catastrophe occurred after 14 kilometres of horrendously fast and reckless driving on your part,' he said.

Nei Lima Da Costa was loaded into a prison van at the Supreme Court in Melbourne on Wednesday after being sentenced to at least 11 years in prison

The three people were killed when Lima Da Costa ran a red light at approximately 120 km/h in Melbourne in January

'It is difficult to contemplate driving offences more serious than yours.'

He condemned Lima Da Costa's use of ice, saying it played a part in his crime.

'The drug known as ice and its effects now represent a significant social problem,' Justice Lasry said.

'It must be confronted by the community with an effective social strategy.'

The traffic light at the intersection in Oakleigh in Melbourne south-eastern suburbs had been red for 17 seconds before Lima Da Costa sped through it at 40km/h above the speed limit, the court heard.

The Menelaous' son Jim Menelaou said Lima Da Costa's punishment was inadequate

His car threw Mr Parsons 52 metres, and the force of the collision broke every bone in his body and severed his arm.

Mr Parsons' wife, Sue Parsons, was metres behind him when he was hit as they walked home after celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary.

'She endured the horrific experience of seeing her husband's life swept away before her very eyes,' Justice Lasry said.

Lima Da Costa, a Brazilian national, pleaded guilty to seven charges including culpable driving causing death, negligently causing serious injury and reckless conduct endangering life.
