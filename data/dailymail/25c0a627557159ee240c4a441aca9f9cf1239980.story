Cheap drinks and late-night clubbing have made Tenerife a haven for thousands of young Britons.

But now the Spanish party island is attracting a different kind of visitor - in the form of pensioners, with tens of thousands of them heading there each year to escape the UK’s miserable weather.

Now a new Channel 5 documentary called OAPs Behaving Badly has revealed how they are blowing their pension, children’s inheritance and winter fuel allowance on partying like teenagers.

Age is no barrier: One couple said they holiday in Tenerife every year for an alcohol-fuelled break - and claim their motto is 'party non-stop until you drop'

In the show, one nightclub is 
described as ‘God’s waiting room’ - because there are so many elderly 
partygoers - and it reveals how a pensioner died after he did the Hokey 
Cokey.

Club manager Marc 
Craig said: ‘We’ve gone from catering for 17, 16 and even 15-year-old 
kids to your 65 and 70 year olds - and they get quite raunchy when 
they’ve had a few drinks.’

Gordon,
 74, and Marie Steele, 70, of Wallasey, Merseyside, holiday in Tenerife 
every year for an alcohol-fuelled break - and claim their motto is 
‘party non-stop until you drop.’

Mrs
 Steele, a retired Cadbury’s factory worker, said: ‘At home we never 
have any alcohol in the house whatsoever - but we go from teetotal to 
practical alcoholics overnight.

‘Our
 golden years are now. We’ve worked hard all our lives and we’ve brought
 up four children. I feel like now it’s time to look after us.’

Mr
 Steele, a retired docker, and his wife are shown throwing a 50th 
birthday party for their daughter Tracie - who struggles to keep up with
 her parents.

She said: ‘When mum and dad fly out to
 Tenerife they’re completely different. They go back to their childhoods
 - they’re like teenagers.

'We’ve
 gone from catering for 17, 16 and even 15-year-old kids to your 65 and 
70 year olds - and they get quite raunchy when they’ve had a few drinks'

Marc Craig, club manager

‘They know how to party hard 
and long and drink lots. They party harder than I do. To party with 
these OAPs I’m going to have to holiday to get over it.’

Mr
 Steele, who admits his winter fuel allowance helps fund his holidays, 
added: ‘It doesn’t matter if you’re the richest man that lived in the 
world - you couldn’t buy one ounce of time.

‘Time to me is the most precious thing we ever possess. So you’ve got to party non-stop until you drop.’

This
 is believed to have happened quite literally - with one of their fellow
 partygoers dying after doing the Hokey Cokey at ‘God’s Waiting Room’.

Mr Steele said: ‘When you see the ages of the people down there, you realise why it’s called that.’

His wife added: ‘It does worry me about dying. Every time we come out there’s somebody gone from year to year.

‘Sometimes
 they’re a bit younger than us, sometimes a bit older. Of course, when 
you get to our age, you don’t know what’s waiting around the corner.’

'At
 home we never have any alcohol in the house whatsoever - but we go from
 teetotal to practical alcoholics overnight. Our golden years are now'

Another pensioner in Tenerift 
is 74-year-old Sixties singer Lee Graham, also known as Leapy Lee, who 
was not ashamed to admit he had a healthy sex life with his 49-year-old 
girlfriend, Bettina.

Mr Graham was
 a one-hit wonder in 1968 with single Little Arrows, which hit number 
two in the UK charts, before moving from his West London home to the 
island where he now plays gigs.

He said: ‘Tenerife is a Mecca for OAPs and it suits me because they all remember me. I’m one of them. It’s grey power.’

Singing: Cheap drinks and late-night clubbing have made Tenerife a haven for young and old Britons

The 56-year-old moved 
from Nottingham to Tenerife after her marriage of 30 years broke down 
and admits she has never looked back.

Now her motto after an alcohol-fuelled night is ‘if you can’t remember it, it didn’t happen.’

'Life
 is for living no matter how old you are - just enjoy it and live it. 
Don’t go home and have a cup of cocoa, have a glass of wine - it’s much 
nicer'

Cheryl Williams, 56

Miss Williams said: ‘I met my 
husband when I was 18 and I was with him for 30 years - it was just an 
existence I think in the end. When I decided to leave that was it.

‘I
 was here on holiday and when I went home I just said I don’t want to be
 married anymore. When I was married I never went out with the girls, I 
never had girly things. I had to learn to be somebody else.

‘I
 wasn’t a married woman anymore. I found my youth that’s why I enjoy 
going out and partying. It’s nice to mix with younger people, you get a 
different outlook on life.

'You could not live the lifestyle we live here, back in the UK. Here it’s a blue sky when you wake up'

Pete Lackey, 60

Pete Lackey worked in communications in Leeds before moving to Tenerife 20 years ago after his business went bust and his marriage broke down.

Despite being 60 years old, he landed a job as a bar promoter and is shown spending his break getting drunk in a nearby pub.

Mr Lackey tried to come back to Britain three years ago, but said: ‘I couldn’t stand the rain on the windows every morning, I couldn’t stand putting money in the electric meters and gas meters.

‘You could not live the lifestyle we live here, back in the UK. I’d have to be up in the morning and be at work by 7am and I’d be depressed. Here it’s a blue sky when you wake up.’
