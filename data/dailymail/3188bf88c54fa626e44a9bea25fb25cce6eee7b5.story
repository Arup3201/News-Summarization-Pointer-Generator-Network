A disabled man is refusing to stop driving his mobility scooter on a dual carriageway - despite the fact it has a top speed of just 8mph.

Ian Broughall, 56, had to be escorted off the 70mph A14 in Cambridgeshire by police when worried motorists saw him crawling along the inside lane earlier this week.

But the former soldier, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, said he has used the road before to travel from his home in Bar Hill to Cambridge and was doing nothing illegal.

Defiant: Ian Broughall has been warned not to ride his mobility scooter along the 70mph A14 dual carriageway in Cambridgeshire again

Mr Broughall, a former Monster Raving
Looney local council candidate, said: 'I have a tax disc and a licence 
and I’m technically allowed to go on the A14 in the scooter.

'I was surprised when the young copper who seemed a bit baffled started checking it.

'He checked the tyres and pointed out I didn’t have a speedometer but I do have tortoise and rabbit speed buttons.

'He then took my number plates because he said they were actually for a TVR sports car.

'I
do have my wing mirror and I know it is not illegal for me to drive 
along the A14 in my scooter. It is only illegal on motorways - I have 
checked.'

The father-of-two said when he was stopped by police while heading to Cambridge to take some photos because it was a nice day. 

Raring to go: Ian Broughall says he is entitled to use his scooter on dual carriageways by law

He added: 'I’ve done it once before, and I was doing just fine until I saw all these flashing lights behind me - and that’s when the trouble started.

'There’s no hard shoulder on that part of the A14, so I was right on the white line and thought that would be OK.

'I think the police caused more of a hold-up because they surrounded me with two vehicles to escort me off.'

Cambridgeshire police said Mr Broughall was given 'strong words of advice' about the dangers of driving his mobility scooter along that particularly road.

A spokesman said: 'The advice is not to use a mobility scooter on a dual carriageway if the speed limit is over 50mph.

'A class 3 vehicle may be driven on a dual carriageway, but the advice is that they must have a flashing amber light.

'The vehicle must also have front and rear lights and reflectors, direction indicators which are able to operate as a hazard warning signal and a rear view mirror.'
