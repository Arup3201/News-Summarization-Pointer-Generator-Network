In a fitting move after Zayn Malik's departure from One Direction, budget supermarket chain Lidl has knocked off a fifth of the price of its One Direction Easter eggs.

The German brand showed it had a sense of humour by announcing the news on its Twitter and Facebook accounts with the caption '#Awkward - looks like we'll just have to knock 1/5 off too' and the hashtag #AlwaysInOurHeartsZaynMalik #ByeZayn'.

The eggs were originally priced at 99p and will now cost 79p after the 20 per cent discount. 

Lidl's response to Zayn Malik's departure from chart-topping boy band One Direction was greeted with merriment by social media users... although there were some loyal fans who found it 'disrespectful'

Zayn Malik announced he was quitting One Direction after five years on Wednesday 

The discount applies to all its UK stores, excluding Northern Ireland. 

A Lidl UK Spokesperson told FEMAIL 'This is naturally devastating news for all the 1D fans out there, ourselves included. 

'In times like this only chocolate will do, so we've decided to reduce our One Direction Easter eggs by 1/5, to help make things a little easier for everyone.' 

The move was greeted with merriment by social media users, with some describing it as 'comedy gold' and 'hilarious' and 'too funny'.

User Jenn Reid made a joke of her own, tweeting: 'A lidl banter never hurt anybody' whilst tweeter Kariss Leigh praised the brand for its swift response, saying: 'That's some genius marketing right there.'

The brand's response did however come under fire from the chart-topping boyband's loyal fanbase, the Directioners.

User @thats0llovcely tweeted: 'That isn't even funny.'

James Davies chimed in with: 'This is so disrespectful to my bae' (the acronym for 'before anyone else') whilst @fluffyxhood was slightly coarser with his comments, saying: 'That's just f****** rude.' The original tweet received more than 20,000 retweets and nearly 26,000 likes on Facebook.

On Wednesday, Zayn Malik quit One Direction after five years.

The 22-year-old singer has made the decision to bow out of the chart-topping boy band, leaving Niall Horan, Harry Styles, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson to continue as a four-piece.

'I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world,' he said.

The Best Song Ever hitmakers will record their fifth album in Zayn's absence and will continue with the remaining dates on the band's forthcoming world tour. 

Zayn said in a statement released to MailOnline on Wednesday afternoon: 'My life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined.

'But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart.'

He continued: 'I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight.
