A DIY store employee's Christmas lights use so much electricity he's afraid to put the kettle on.

Hobbyist Wayne Skinner and his family are facing an extra £500 on their bills this year - but say it's all worth it to raise money for the local air ambulance.

Dozens of neighbours gathered in Bolsover, Derbyshire, for the big switch-on at the two-bed semi-detached home where the 26-year-old lives with his parents John and Susan.

Deck the halls! Hobbyist Wayne Skinner and his family are facing an extra £500 on the bills for their semi-detached home in Bolsover, Derbyshire - but say it's all worth it to raise money for the local air ambulance

The dazzling display includes glowing Santa figures, doves with flapping wings, and bells which sound as if they're ringing thanks to a synchronised soundtrack.

Mr Skinner, who trained as an electrician and works in the electrical department at Wickes, said: 'The lights are sequenced in time with the music with special software and it's all controlled via two control panels.

'We don't boil the kettle or put the cooker on while we've got the lights on because it's an old house and an old supply, and we don't like putting too much power on it.

'So we boil the kettle, pour it in a flask and have a flask of hot water while the lights are on.'

The display, in its 12th year, takes seven weeks to assemble and costs a fortune - including £150 for a control panel, £150 for software and another £600 for a control board shipped in from the U.S.

Mr Skinner said: 'We don't boil the kettle or put the cooker on while we've got the lights on because it's an old house and we don't like putting too much power on it. So we boil the kettle and pour it in a flask'

In many previous years it cost more than it raised, making an average of around £300 a year.

But last year the donations rocketed to around £850, and Mr Skinner said he had high hopes for this year's event.

'We get more and more visitors as the word gets round and it's becoming more popular,' he said.

Mr Skinner's mother helped switch on the lights this week dressed as Santa in a sleigh pulled by two shire horses.

It took six and a half hours to program just one song, DIsney's Frozen, to play in time with the lights.

Even if it's raining onlookers can still watch the display from their car, as it's being broadcast on FM radio.

Then and now: Mr Skinner (right) was inspired as a toddler by the Blackpool Illuminations (left)

There is also a pixel matrix screen which Mr Skinner built, a 'reindeer-cam' which beams the scene into the Skinners' front room and seven other cameras. 

Mr Skinner was a toddler when he became obsessed with Christmas lights after seeing the Blackpool Illuminations.

It sparked a life-long hobby - and some of his display even includes lights once used in the seaside town.

'I've always wanted to get a job working on the Blackpool Illuminations but I think they only employ people who live nearby, so I decided to make my own', he said.

'It's a nice thing to put a hobby into making people smile, making people happy and raising money for charity at the same time.

'It's a win-win, everyone benefits really'.
