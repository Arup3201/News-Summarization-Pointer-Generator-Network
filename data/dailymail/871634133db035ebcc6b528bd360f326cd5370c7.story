Tens of thousands of homes across Australia are not getting their rubbish collected after the country’s largest waste management firm has grounded its entire fleet.

Transpacific has called an urgent safety audit of its 2,800 vehicles following one of the company’s trucks smashing into three stationary cars killing a man and a woman, and critically injuring two others, including the truck driver in Adelaide on Monday.

The Queensland-based company, which has more than 100 municipal contracts in almost every state, confirmed most services would be delayed by 24 hours this week, while some services had completely stopped. Most rubbish removal operations were expected to be back to normal by Monday.

A Transpacific truck smashed into three stationary cars killing a man and a woman, and critically injuring two others, including the truck driver in Adelaide on Monday

The accident has prompted truck company Transpacific to pull all 2,800 of its fleet off the road to conduct safety audits

The areas have been affected in almost every state including five suburbs in Darwin, the three Victorian cities of Benalla, Geelong and Melbourne and at least two Adelaide councils along with some regional South Australian areas, the ABC reported.

Western Australia is one of the hardest hit with tens of thousands of homes in Perth and the state’s south-west services have also ground to a halt.

Transpacific spokeswoman Megan Taylor told the ABC it was unclear how long the fleet would be grounded in WA.

‘The vehicle will need to be deemed safe before they can return to the road,’ she said. ‘In the meantime, there will be no rubbish collections.’

Queensland will also suffer from the safety audit including Cairns, Rockhampton and the Somerset Regional Council.

The collection stoppage will also affect Sydney residents in Parramatta, Hornsby, Bankstown, Ashfield, Canterbury, Hawkesbury, and the Hill Shire council regions.

The incident in question occurred late Monday afternoon, when a garbage truck ploughed into three stationary cars that were stopped at traffic lights at the intersection of the South Eastern Freeway and Cross Road in Adelaide.

A 56 year-old male driver of one of the cars was killed, while two female drivers aged 41 and 49, and the 28 year-old male truck driver were taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital in a critical condition.

The 41 year-old woman passed away on Tuesday evening.

Police are investigating whether brake failure or speed played a part in the incident while Transpacific said the truck driver had undergone thorough safety training.

Transport Workers Union secretary Tony Sheldon said truck driving was Australia's most dangerous job with 330 people killed every year in crashes

TWU national secretary Tony Sheldon said Transpacific's decision to ground its fleet was further evidence of the economic pressure imposed by clients on transport companies and their drivers.

Mr Sheldon said truck driving was Australia's most dangerous job with 330 people killed every year in crashes.

'That pressure is killing truck drivers, and its killing motorists and pedestrians,' he said.

He said economic pressure on drivers could be addressed through action in the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, a national safety watchdog which sets safe rates of pay and conditions in heavy vehicle transport.

Meanwhile, Sue Posnakidis released a statement, on behalf of the family of John Posnakidis, who died in October 2010 in a crash on the South Eastern Freeway, requesting that media desist from seeking further interviews following that latest tragedy out of respect for the family’s privacy.

'We are devastated by the further loss of lives and injuries suffered as a result of the collision on the South Eastern freeway on Monday. This revives traumatic memories for our family.'

'Our hearts and prayers go out to all the families involved. We are hopeful that the findings and recommendations of the Deputy Coroner will assist in stopping these horrific tragedies from happening yet again,' she said.

'At John's inquest Mr Schapel said that this will happen again, and it has. It has to stop. Truck drivers and motorists need to be protected and safe on the freeway.

We don't want John's life and the others lost on Monday and in recent years to be lost in vain.'
