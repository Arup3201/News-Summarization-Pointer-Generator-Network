The partial remains of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo have been found in Tennessee more than three years after her disappearance from the driveway of her rural home, officials said on Monday.

The remains, which included a skull, were found in a Decatur County wood, not far from her home in the town of Parsons, about 110 miles east of Memphis, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn told a news conference.

Bobo was 20 when she disappeared in April, 2011. Her brother told police that he saw a man dressed in camouflage leading her away into the woods. Investigators and volunteers scoured the woods and fields of the town of about 2,400 for clues, but her remains were not found.

Bobo had been preparing to go to class at nursing school on the morning of her disappearance.

Confirmed: The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Monday night that remains of Holly Bobo were found on Sunday

TBI Director Mark Gwyn confirmed the positive identification during a press conference late on Monday night.

'It was my prayer as well the prayers of many others that Holly Bobo would be found,' Gwyn said.

'And I assure you this is not over by any means. The investigation is still ongoing to get to the truth.'

Gwyn has said the Bobo investigation has been the most expensive and exhaustive in TBI history, and it's not over yet.

Since Bobo disappeared, the small town of Parsons and surrounding areas in West Tennessee tried to support the family, putting up pink ribbons on lamp posts, mailboxes and storefronts. Bobo was wearing a pink shirt and carrying a pink purse before she disappeared.

Two men found a skull Sunday not far from property owned by the family of Zachary Adams, who has been charged with Bobo's kidnapping and murder. He has pleaded not guilty. The area near his family's property was searched in March.  

District Attorney General Matt Stowe speaks as TBI Director Mark Gwyn listens on Monday night

A second man facing murder and kidnapping charges, Jason Autry, also has pleaded not guilty.

Recently elected District Attorney Matt Stowe said his office was preparing to seek a possible death penalty in the case. A decision is expected in coming weeks, after he consults with the Bobo family, he said.

'The evidence is voluminous,' Stowe said. 'We are going to make sure that everyone who played a part in the heinous crime that has attacked the peace and dignity of the state of Tennessee faces a consequence for that.'

Stowe said the Bobo family would be issuing a statement Tuesday.

Before the news conference Monday, the Bobo family was trying to remain calm and let authorities do their job, said their attorney, Steve Farese.

'You can imagine the emotional roller coaster that they've been on,' Farese said.

In
 May, brothers Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy were both charged 
with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence. Like Autry and Adams, they have pleaded not guilty.

Jeffrey Pearcy allegedly showed a friend cell phone footage of Bobo tied up and crying before her murder.

The friend, Sandra King, testified at a preliminary hearing in May that she saw Zachary Adams in the footage.

Mrs King also claimed that Jeffrey Pearcy told her that his brother Mark had filmed the incident.

'I seen a woman that was tied up that was crying,' King told the court, WMC reported.

'She was blonde... It looked like Holly Bobo.'

King said it appeared the blonde in the video was about to be sexually assaulted, but she did not see.

'I knew what he was fixing to do. I did not want to see,' King said.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has not seen the video.

Jeffrey Pearcy has denied the video exists and agents are now trying to find out if it is on his cell phone.

'I have no video. I have not seen a 
video, never even heard of the video until I was questioned about it the
 day of my arrest,' Pearcy said in June.

Denials: Jeffrey Pearcy said that he does not have a video which could help solve the murder and disappearance of Holly Bobo, has never met her and doesn't know her family

Revelations: Witness Sandra King testified at a 
preliminary hearing in July that she saw missing student Holly Bobo 
tied up and crying in cell phone footage shown to her by Jeffrey Pearcy

King worked with police to try and have Pearcey acknowledge the video in a phone call.

'I
 said to him, "You know that video of Holly, if it would have been you 
in that video, I would have watched it," and he said, 'Yes I know', 
King said.

Both men have pleaded not guilty.

Adams was indicted in March on charges of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder.

Autry,was indicted in April on first-degree murder and especially aggravated kidnapping charges.

TBI
 director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from
 witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after 
she had been reported missing.

Gwynn added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses.

'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5.

'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.'

He
 added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to 
solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will
 prevail.' 

'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added.

Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case

Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo

The
 first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee 
Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around 
Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams.

Adams, was arrested and charged shortly afterwards.

Adams
 appeared in court in April on charges of coercion of a witness after 
allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against 
him.

Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing.

Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported.

Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder.

He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. 

The
 case about Miss Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are 
considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction in the 
case.
