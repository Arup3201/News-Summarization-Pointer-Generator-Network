Labour health spokesman Diane Abbott was caught up in a new row last night over claims that she fell asleep during a Westminster debate on abortion laws.

The allegations surfaced after Ms Abbott’s shock resignation from a  parliamentary committee established to consider whether women should  be offered independent advice when deciding whether to terminate a  pregnancy.

Fellow committee member Tory MP Nadine Dorries claimed Ms Abbott’s walkout came after she played virtually no part in any of the committee’s three meetings.

Ms Abbott vehemently denied nodding off. But Ms Dorries, who has campaigned for a tightening of abortion criteria, said she ‘slept through’ the first meeting, ‘didn’t turn up’ for the second and ‘arrived late’ for the third.

Ms Dorries claimed that at one point, the chairman of the committee, Health Minister Anne Milton, spoke loudly to try to rouse slumbering Ms Abbott.

Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson backed up Ms Dorries, saying: ‘I was virtually sitting opposite Diane Abbott at one meeting and she was definitely dropping off during part of it.’

Ms Abbott and Ms Dorries clashed angrily in a showdown on BBC2’s Newsnight, during which host Kirsty Wark challenged Ms Abbott about the claims she had fallen asleep.

The committee was set up last year after Ms Dorries’s call for women to be offered independent abortion advice failed to win the support of MPs.

She claims charities such as the British Pregnancy Advisory Service cannot guarantee to offer impartial advice because they receive money for  carrying out abortions.

Critics say that Ms Dorries’s proposal could threaten a woman’s right to have a termination.

When her plan failed to win backing in the Commons, the Government pledged to set up a committee to seek public opinion. It is made up of MPs from both sides of the debate.

Ms Dorries said: ‘Diane’s conduct on the committee was appalling. She barely contributed. She slept through the first one, so much so that when the Minister addressed her, she had to speak up because it appeared Diane hadn’t heard because she was asleep.

‘She didn’t turn up for the second one and was late for the third one. From what I recall, her longest contribution in any of the meetings was to explain why she was late.’

Ms Abbott denied ‘storming off’ the committee. She said she had resigned because she believed it was a ‘fix’ intended to favour Ms Dorries’s views on abortion.

Ms Dorries said: ‘I suspect the real reason she resigned is because when she is asked what her input is, she won’t be able to say. She is not fit to be the Opposition health spokeswoman.’

Last night a spokesman for Ms Abbott said: ‘Diane attended two meetings and, unfortunately, had to miss one. Nadine is being a bit silly when she says Diane slept through a meeting. It’s an attempt to distract from the real issues.’

Earlier this month Ms Abbott came under fire over her ‘whites divide and rule’ comment after the trial of the racist killers of black teenager Stephen Lawrence.

Labour leader Ed Miliband forced her to apologise.
