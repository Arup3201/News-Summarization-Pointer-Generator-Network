John Terry's father was fined for racial abuse two months after allegedly headbutting an Asian man and calling him a 'f****** Paki', a jury heard today.

Ted Terry, 59, is accused of attacking Amarjit Talafair following a dispute over a cigarette outside a City of London pub in March last year.

The Old Bailey heard that just over two months later, on May 24, the Chelsea footballer's father admitted calling a member of the public a 'f****** Irish prick' and a 'f****** mongrel'.

Claims: Ted Terry, left, is accused of racially abusing Amarjit Talafair, right, and headbutting him 

It came after Terry was involved in a row at Barking rail station on the night of May 12, the jury was told.

After
 missing his train, he told station staff: 'What do you mean it's gone, 
I've got a ticket you f****** moron. How am I going to get home?'

When
 a member of the public intervened to ask him to stop swearing he 
allegedly replied: 'Who the f*** are you to say that, are you a rozzer?

'F*** you pikey c***, you f****** mongrel.'

The court heard he was charged with a 
racially aggravated public order offence which he admitted on May 24 
last year and was fined £200.

He admitted saying 'f****** Irish prick' but denied using the word 'pikey'.

Family: Mr Talafair has been accused of making the story up to capitalise on the fame of Terry's son John

On trial: Stephen Niland, left, and Tudor Musteata, right, are also accused of racial abuse 

Terry
 currently faces allegations that he head butted Mr Talafair in a row 
over a cigarette before hurling racist abuse at him on March 22, 2013.

He then allegedly threatened cleaner Bakeba Mansuila with a bottle saying 'I'll smash it over your head, you black c***'.

Terry
 is said to have been drinking for several hours before he and 
co-defendants Stephen Niland, 36, and Tudor Musteata, 47, started the 
row at the Windsor pub in the City of London.

When
 Mr Talafair said he didn't have a cigarette Terry allegedly called him a
 'f***ing paki' and attacked him telling him 'Let's have it right here 
and now.'

Mr Talafair claims he was headbutted just below the nose.

The three men then walked off towards Fenchurch Street station.

Terry, of Grays, Essex, denies one 
count of racially-aggravated common assault and one count of 
racially-aggravated fear or provocation of violence.

Co-defendants
 Niland, of Romford, Essex, and Musteata, of 
Greenwich, south-east London, deny one count each of racially-aggravated
 fear or provocation of violence.

The trial, which is expected to last until the end of the week, continues.
