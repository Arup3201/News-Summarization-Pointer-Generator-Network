It was a lottery like no other, with the fate of tiny children at stake on the pick of a ball.

The street lights were lowered outside so that hundreds of mothers were granted anonymity as they queued at Georgian London's new Foundling Hospital in the 1740s to give their babies away.

Unmarried women abandoned by their seducers or lovers, together with impoverished widows who couldn't support their newborns, hoped their children would have a better future inside the hospital -essentially a children's home - which educated and trained little boys to become apprentices, and little girls as servants.

And such was the demand for places that a ballot system of white, red and black balls had to be introduced.

A white ball meant a baby had won a place provided it didn't have an infectious disease; a red ball meant a child was put on the waiting list to replace those who failed their medical; and a black ball meant the baby was turned away.

And there was a big audience for it, with fashionable society sponsors of the hospital crowding the public gallery to watch the heart-rending process in the room where the Court of Hospital Governors met.

'It was like some dreadful TV contest - yet it was a practical solution to a very real problem,' says Catherine Hogg, curator of an exhibition to mark ten years of the Foundling Museum which stands on the site of the old hospital and which forms the backdrop for a heart-tugging new BBC docu-drama about it.

John Milner, the hospital's treasurer, had borrowed the blackballing idea from the membership selection at 18th-century London gentlemen's clubs such as White's. Contemporary witnesses, however, recalled that the wailing of bereft mothers whose babies had been chosen in this impossibly poignant contest was just as loud as those whose babies had been blackballed.

They would leave tokens behind - scraps of embroidered cloth, poems and letters, medals, coins and even just walnuts by the poorest - to identify themselves and their babies in case they could come back to claim their offspring in happier times.

Yet since that meant repaying the hospital for the child's keep to ensure the feckless didn't abuse the system, 'Less than ten per cent of mothers did so over the two centuries that the hospital existed,' according to Caro Howell, director of the Foundling Museum.

The hospital was started by a big-hearted former sailor and ship-builder called Thomas Coram, who was horrified at the number of babies abandoned in the London streets in the 1720s when he came home from his voyages.

He had to campaign for 17 years for a Royal Charter, which he was granted in 1739, to establish the hospital as one of England's first children's charities. He was one of three childless men central to the success of the hospital. Both Coram and the painter William Hogarth, who became a governor, were married but with no heirs, while the composer George Frideric Handel, also a governor, was a bachelor.

To raise funds, Hogarth exhibited his paintings at the hospital (and thus created Britain's first public art gallery), designed the children's uniforms and the coat of arms, and he and his wife Jane fostered foundling children, while Handel conducted his new Messiah masterpiece in its chapel in annual performances that brought in the crowds.

It was the perfect link between philanthropy and the arts, with obvious benefits to both sides.

And in what looks set to be TV's biggest baby tear-jerker since Call The Midwife, BBC2's Messiah At The Foundling Hospital will tell the whole story.

Former EastEnders actor Paul Moriarty plays Coram, Christopher Staines is Hogarth and Paul McCreesh is Handel, with TV's At Home With The Georgians historian Amanda Vickery and music critic Tom Service presenting the dramatised excerpts. 'It's an incredibly moving subject to film,' says executive producer Ben Weston.

'We start by restaging the first night of Messiah at the hospital in 1750, and later show the blackballing contest and the babies' heads being inspected for lice.

The children admitted were never allowed to know about the tokens their mothers had left in case they never came back; instead the boys and girls were identified by a lead number on a chain round their necks.'

Caro Howell continues, 'For the first five years of their lives the children were fostered in the countryside – because it was healthier than London – before being brought back to the hospital to be educated and eventually apprenticed.'

The regime was strict by our modern standards, with the system of removing the five-year-olds from their country foster parents an obvious wrench for both sides that continued until 1954 when the hospital finally closed. Yet governors took an interest in the children even after they'd left to become apprentices – and would use their powers to get any savage employers of their former charges arrested and punished.

'Foundling children were also among the first in Britain to be vaccinated,' says the show's co-producer Liz Hartford.

At a time when child mortality was 99 per cent in the workhouses, the concern for the babies' health was such that governors became 'Inspectors of Wet Nurses', visiting their lodgings to make sure the women were married. To make doubly sure of no immorality, the inspectors were accompanied by their wives…

'The women had to plead their cases and 
prove the child was their first, that they were of previous good 
character and not entirely the agents of their own misfortune'

By the 1830s, the increasing pressure on places meant that only illegitimate babies were admitted. 'The women had to plead their cases and prove the child was their first, that they were of previous good character and not entirely the agents of their own misfortune - and the governors would follow up with careful checks,' according to Caro Howell.

Charles Dickens, who lived round the corner from the hospital in Doughty Street, became a sponsor, named his kindly Mr Brownlow in Oliver Twist after one of the hospital secretaries and wrote a play, No Thoroughfare, with novelist Wilkie Collins that begins at the gates of  the hospital.

His benevolence even extended to putting in a good word for one mother, Susan Mayne - but, embarrassingly for him, the governors turned her application down after she was found to have syphilis.

These days celebrities continue to keep up the museum's profile, with artist Grayson Perry and also the bestselling children's authors Jacqueline Wilson and Michael Morpurgo among its current patrons.

Meanwhile the hospital lives on in the children's charity Coram, aptly named after the old sea-dog with the softest of hearts who founded it.

Messiah At The Foundling Hospital is on BBC2 on 19 April. The Foundling Museum's exhibition, By George! Handel's Music For Royal Occasions, continues until 18 May, www.found lingmuseum.org.uk.
