Ian Jardine suffered crushing pains in his chest and shortness of breath but was told he was just suffering from indigestion

A widow whose husband died from a heart attack after being told four times he had indigestion and muscle ache has been awarded £100,000 compensation.

Ian Jardine, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, suffered pains in his chest and shortness of breath at work before he was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk.

However, medics in Accident and Emergency diagnosed the pain as a muscle ache and sent him home.

He was also told to take painkillers and medication for indigestion.

But Mr Jardine continued to suffer severe chest pains for more than a week and was twice sent away from his GP with medication for indigestion and painkillers.

On his second trip home from the doctors’ surgery Mr Jardine was seriously ill and an ambulance was called.

Paramedics advised Mr Jardine he should go to hospital but allowed him to decide against getting treatment.

Mr Jardine died that night from a heart attack.

After a four-year battle his wife Sharon, 49, has now been awarded £100,000 by Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust in an out-of-court settlement.

Mrs Jardine’s solicitor Jeanette Aspinall, of Fletchers Solicitors, said: 'A number of opportunities were missed for Mr Jardine to be correctly diagnosed, but not a single medical professional he met was able to correctly identify his life-threatening condition.

'It should have been clear that something was seriously wrong.'

Mr Jardine fell ill at work on June 12, 2009, and was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital by ambulance.

He was diagnosed with a musculoskeletal problem before being sent home.

The next day a second ambulance was called to Mr Jardine’s home but paramedics did not admit him to hospital telling him instead to rest.

Two days later Mr Jardine was still in agony and went to his GP, but again he was told he had indigestion and given some painkillers.

On June 19, Mr Jardine was still in pain and went back to his GP only to be given treatment for sickness and nausea and painkiller co-codamol.

The next day Mrs Jardine’s lawyers say he went back and was dismissed with more pills for indigestion.

An ambulance had to be called after Mr Jardine was seriously unwell on his way home from the surgery, but paramedics did not admit him.

He died at home on June 20 from a coronary thrombus.

Sir Bruce Keogh has highlighted the need to reform emergency health services

Solicitor Ms Aspinall says the case highlights the urgent need for reform in emergency health services, as highlighted by Sir Bruce Keogh, national medical director of NHS England earlier this month.

She added: 'Under the proposed "two-tier" system, Mr Jardine would have been taken directly to a specialist centre where a competent professional would have been able to correctly diagnose his condition and potentially save his life.

'In his review, Bruce Keogh has rightly identified the importance of fast tracking such cases to the people best equipped to make an informed choice, rather than assuming all front line professionals have the ability to make the right judgement call in all circumstances.'

A Queen Elizabeth Hospital spokesman said: 'We wish to apologise to Mrs Jardine and her family and to express our deep regret for the shortcomings in her husband’s care.'

An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We accept that Mr Jardine’s medical condition was not diagnosed properly and, therefore, accepted liability for our part in that.

'We would like to offer our sincere apologies to his family and friends for their very sad loss.'
