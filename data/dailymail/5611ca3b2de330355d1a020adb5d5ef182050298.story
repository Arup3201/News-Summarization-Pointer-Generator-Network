A drink-driver who had been downing shots was caught when he ran out of petrol on the motorway and police stopped to help.

Officers quickly realised that Tariq Mahmood, 31, stank of booze when they stopped to assist him at around 5am on the hard shoulder of the M62 near Eccles.

The 31-year-old from Stoke-On-Trent has been banned from driving for three-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to driving over the limit. 

Police spotted him and another man standing over the Vauxhall Astra in the early hours of the morning, Manchester Magistrates Court heard.

They went over to see if he needed any assistance. But after speaking to him they soon realised that he smelt of alcohol, the court was told.

Mahmood was breathalysed and was found to be two and a half times the legal limit and was taken to a nearby police station.

It is his second drink driving conviction and his fourth driving-related offence in five years.

Defending himself, Mahmood said: 'I stopped drinking but my mates gave me a couple of drinks, a couple of shots.

'And I thought I was covered on my girlfriend's insurance because we are both fully comp.'

He was also fined £480 and ordered to pay £85 costs with a £32 surcharge.

Matthew Siddall, prosecuting, said: 'This difficulty with this case is his record.'

Chairman of the bench Margaret Elridge told him: 'This is a serious matter.

'This is your second drink-driving offence in 10 years so this period of disqualification is obligatory.

'However, we have taken into account your prompt guilty plea.'

His lowest reading was 85mg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath, nearly two and a half times the limit of 35.
