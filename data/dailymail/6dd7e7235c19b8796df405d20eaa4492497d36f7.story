New role: Fox News has confirmed that Clueless actress Stacey Dash has joined the news network as a contributor

Dash has a 'distinctive viewpoints amongst her Hollywood peers,' said VP of Programming Bill Shine about her hiring

Her
 Republican beliefs caused a firestorm for the 47-year-old actress during the 2012 
election when she publicly announced her support for Mitt Romney.

In the past two years she has made several appearances on Fox News as a guest commentator including appearing on the new Fox News show Outnumbered as a guest panelist.

‘I just think that the Democrats and the liberals have taken advantage of showbusiness, but California and showbusiness is the purest form of capitalism, and that's a fact,’ she said during an appearance on Fox and Friends in early April.

She went on to explain that she is a proponent of states’ rights and the importance of localized government programs.

Vote Romney: In 2012 the Clueless star took to Twitter to show how she would be voting in the presidential election

‘For the federal government
 to just throw a big blanket over a big entire country and say "We're 
all a bunch of babies and now we're all warm and cozy" is just a bit 
ridiculous,’ she said.

The New York Post recently reported that Dash is in talks with the network about developing a satirical comedy series.

The premise of the show, which has the tentative title of 'Stacey 
Dash is Normal' - follows Dash's life as a Republican single mother 
living in Hollywood.

Dash became a conservative darling in 2012 when she started speaking out about politics after revealing that, unlike many African American voters, she supported Romney.

‘I believe that if you stand for something you have to stand for it, you can't hide behind it or it won't get done,’ she told the Fox and Friends crew last month.

She said that her career has not been negatively impacted as a result of her Republican beliefs, perhaps because she said that there were more conservatives in Hollywood than many would expect.

‘If you make movies and the movies make 
money, they're going to make the movie. You know for example, if 
Obamacare were a movie they would not make a sequel, let's just say 
that,’ she joked.

During an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan at the time, she used a line made famous by Martin Luther King Jr, saying that she chose her presidential pick 'not by the color of his skin but the content of his character'.

The interview came after she received a barrage of social media attacks for calling a vote for Romney 'the only choice for your future'.

While many took issue with Dash, then-Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan reached out to her to thank her.

'He said thank you so much for your support, and that I was brave and that they support me and I thought that was so generous and kind, lovely,' Dash told Morgan.

She said that she switched from supporting President Obama in 2008 to endorsing his 2012 opponent 'because of the state of the country'.

'I want the next four years to be different,' she said at the time.
