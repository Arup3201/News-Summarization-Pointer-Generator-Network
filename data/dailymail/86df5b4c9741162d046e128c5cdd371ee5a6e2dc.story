Living in fear of a partner or family member does not stop over Christmas

It’s a time for family gatherings, celebrations and present-giving.

However, excessive alcohol consumption and money worries over Christmas contribute to a peak period for domestic abuse.

For thousands of women, men and children up and down the country, the festive period remains a time where their own home is not safe.

Living in fear of a partner or family member does not stop over Christmas, and statistics reveal incidences of domestic violence increase over the holidays.

During the last quarter of 2013, there was a 15.5 per cent rise in victims suffering abuse at home.

And it is estimated that one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime.

In the UK, two women are killed every week by a current or ex-partner, and many police forces across the UK see a spike in reports around Christmas.

Sandra Horley CBE, chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, says: 'Christmas can be an incredibly difficult time for women and children experiencing domestic violence.

‘Christmas is meant to be a time of joy, a time of generosity, a time of caring. But for too many women and children, the 25th December will be yet another day of living with fear, intimidation and violence.'

The physical, economic, and psychological abuse suffered by victims of domestic violence can make it incredibly difficult for victims to leave. 

Isabel*, 35, explains how she was a ‘successful, independent businesswoman’ when she first met her ex-husband Mark, who started being violent to her when she fell pregnant.

'I wasn't sure about him at first, but he pursued me relentlessly, charming me with gifts, flowers and surprise trips abroad,’ she said. 

Christmas is a peak time for domestic violence, according to statistics

'He was at the top of his profession and he bowled me over.

'He wanted to get married and have children straight away. It was exciting and romantic - I thought I had met the love of my life.

'It's only now, looking at back at the whole picture that I can see that this was controlling behaviour and his inability to take no for an answer.

'After we had moved in together, he kept starting arguments. I put it down to the stress he was under at work. 

Sandra Horley CBE, chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, says: 'Every couple has arguments and disagreements – we all say and do things we later regret. 

'Domestic violence is systematic, purposeful and patterned behaviour designed to control another person.

'If a woman is forced to change her behaviour because she is frightened of her partner's reaction, then she is being abused.

'Domestic violence can be physical, emotional, psychological, financial or sexual.

'Abuse tends to become more frequent and more severe over time; even if you are not being hit, you may still be being abused. If your partner is excessively jealous or possessive, or if he controls where you go, who you speak to, how you dress or wear your hair, these are all warning signs of domestic violence.'

‘We had been together for about a year when one of these rows ended with him threatening me with a kitchen knife.

‘I decided to leave him, but when he agreed to go to relationship counselling, I gave him another chance.'

Like many abusers, Mark began isolating Isabel and making her economically reliant on him, encouraging her to leave the business that she ran with a colleague.

She said: 'The moment the business had a bad time he was encouraging me to sell up and leave it, promising he would take care of me and support me.

‘There were subtle pressures to force me under his economic control and take away my independence.’

'The next year, we got married and I fell pregnant. That was when the violence started.

'We were arguing after we had missed our flight for a holiday. Suddenly he hit me and threw me across the room.'

As with many cases of abuse, the violence outburst was not a one-off, and Mark became increasingly abusive towards Isabel.

'Throughout the pregnancy, I had to explain away the bruises from his punches and kicks. I told the midwife I had fallen down the stairs,’ she said.

'Anything could set off a violent outburst from Mark. I was constantly walking on eggshells.

'But whenever I tried to leave, he would reel me back in, telling me that he would change and that he wanted us to be a family.’

Emotionally manipulated and abused by Mark, Isabel felt unable to leave him and isolated from friends and family.

Arguments can often happen in front of the children - and escalate out of control 

'They [abusers] are very clever. He made me believe it was things I was doing wrong that was setting him off.

'After the birth of our second child he had a massive falling out with my family and gave me an ultimatum; him or them. We had just had a baby and I was desperate to keep the family together. So I was totally alone.

'The violence was sporadic and I began to question whether I was causing it. I didn't have the term domestic abuse in my head at all.

‘It sounds silly but I thought domestic abuse meant having a black eye. Because I wasn't turning up at the school gate covered in bruises everyday it wasn't domestic violence.'

Despite his promises to change, Mark became worse after the birth of the couple's second child.

'One day a normal conversation suddenly turned into a frenzied attack,’ Isabel explained.

‘He punched me to the ground, kicked me in the back, and then threw me across the room - all in front of our two-year-old and the baby.'

It was only after this incident in the presence of the children that Isabel called the police.

However, it took several more attacks and calls to the emergency services before Isabel found the strength to leave permanently, getting legal help to set up restraining orders.

'The police were not very supportive, it was like they were just ticking things off their check list and rolling their eyes,’ she said.

'Eventually the police put me in touch with Refuge. One of their outreach workers, Anna*, started helping me.

'The very act of being believed allowed everything to just come pouring out.

'We talked about everything I had been through and she helped me to understand that Mark's behaviour was all about power and control. Just that initial emotional support was so important.

'But then she also calmly helped talked me through the practicalities, navigating the next stage. With her support, I made a plan to stay safe.

'Anna supported me as I went through the divorce and child contact proceedings. Thanks to her I was able to start rebuilding my life away from Mark.

'I was devastated when the crown prosecution service said there wasn't enough evidence to prosecute him, but I have had to move on.

'Now things are so much better. It isn't easy to break away from a violent partner; I don't think I could have done it without Refuge's support.

‘I would urge anyone who is living with fear and intimidation at home to visit Refuge's website and find out more - you are not alone and there is life on the other side of domestic violence.'

Sandra Horley CBE, chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, said: 'People often ask, “Why do women stay with violent men?”.

'The answer is complicated. There are a huge number of practical and psychological barriers to leaving an abusive partner.

'Victims of domestic violence are frequently isolated by their abusers: systematically cut off from friends and family. It can be incredibly hard for women to reach out for help in situations like this.

If a woman is forced to change her behaviour because she is frightened of her partner then she is being abused. This list may help you to identify whether you are experiencing domestic violence: 

'The grinding impact of emotional abuse can chip away at a woman's sense of self. She may begin to believe her abuser when he tells her, day in, day out, that she is worthless, that no-one will believe her, that no-one cares about her but him.

'Abusers manipulate their victims carefully and purposefully; they switch readily between charm and rage, like Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.

'Fear can be a paralysing force: many women stay with their abusers because they are terrified of what will happen if they leave. This is a well-founded fear. Domestic violence takes a staggering death toll, killing two women every week, and the vast majority of domestic homicides happen when a woman is trying to separate from her abuser.

'Some women may not be able to support themselves and their children financially on their own. Refuges and other support services are being closed across the country as a result of ongoing funding cuts – reducing the number of escape routes available to women and children.

'Domestic violence will not end unless we stop asking “Why does she stay?” and instead ask the right questions: “Why does he abuse?” and “What can we do as a society to end domestic violence once and for all?”.’'
