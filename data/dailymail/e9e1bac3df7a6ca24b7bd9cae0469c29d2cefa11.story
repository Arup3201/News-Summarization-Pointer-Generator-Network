A woman who gave birth in the bathroom of a busy sports bar then killed her baby and hid it in the toilet was tracked down and arrested after police traced a blood stain the woman left on the booth where she was sitting, it was revealed today.

Amanda Catherine Hein, 26, was at Starters Pub near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, watching pay-per-view wrestling with three friends August 17, when she left and went to the bathroom for about 40 minutes. She returned with blood on her clothes, but insisted she was fine.

Police say Hein went outside and smoked a cigarette, then returned to her friends and continued watching the match.

Horror: This is the toilet where the baby was found wrapped in a trash bag and hidden in the tank

Starts Pub sports bar was crowded with wrestling fans watching a major pay-per-view match when Hein gave birth in the bathroom

The next morning, a janitor who checked on the toilet after complaints that it would not flush, found the child wrapped in a plastic garbage bag, submerged in the tank behind the toilet seat. 

Hein was charged with murder Monday and could face the death penalty.

The Lehigh Valley Express-Times reports that an autopsy found that Hein had given birth to a healthy, full-term baby boy. The child suffocated to death.

Hein said she realized she was pregnant in May or June, but did not tell anyone. None of her friends who were with her the night she gave birth knew that she was carrying a child.

They also did not know she had gone into labor on August 17.

That night, Hein and three male friends reserved a booth at Starters bar to watch the WWE SummerSlam pay-per-view wrestling match.

The grisly find at a popular pub shocked residents of the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania

Her friends told police she was complaining of back pain and spasms during the match. When she excused herself, she was gone for so long that they began to send her text messages.

After she allegedly killed the baby, she stayed at the bar for another hour.

She had blood on her clothing, but refused to go home until the match was over. 

After the discovery of the child in the toilet, the waiters at Starters told police they remembered having to clean up blood at one of the booths on August 17.

Managers at the bar were able to look up who reserved the booth - which led detectives to Luis Rivera - one of Hein's friends.

Rivera led police to Hein.

When she was questioned by officers, she admitted that she had given birth to a live baby and that she had killed him and hid him the toilet after wrapping him in a plastic bag she took from the bathroom garbage can.

Because of the age of the child, Hein could be sentenced to death, if convicted of murder.

Bar owner David Rank said his staff were extremely upset by the grisly incident. He allowed 
those who wished to go home, others opted to stay and Rank opened the 
pub to customers at 1pm, two hours later than usual.

'My biggest concern is for my employees, the mother, the baby,' said Rank.

'I just want everyone to say prayers for them.'
