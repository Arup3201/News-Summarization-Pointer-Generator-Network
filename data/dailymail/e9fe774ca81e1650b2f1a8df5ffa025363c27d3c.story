It’s a pioneering crime-fighting technique that could have come straight from a detective drama – and will soon be hitting the streets of Britain.

When officers arrive at a crime scene, they will be able to quickly and easily find out whether the perpetrator has left behind saliva, sweat or other bodily fluids with the help of a fluorescent spray.

Until now, finding and analysing these samples – which can help uncover the guilty party’s identity – has been a complicated and time-consuming process.

Investigation help: The new technology could help police apprehend criminals more quickly by lighting up bodily fluids

But once the new ‘forensic biosensor’ spray has been applied, it will immediately light up in one of four different bright colours – telling officers whether the sample is blood, sweat, saliva or semen.

The item can then be sent for immediate forensic analysis to extract DNA and, if the offender is already known to the police, help them make an immediate arrest.

The spray, which uses the latest bio and nano technologies, has been developed by scientists at King’s College London.

It has been in progress for almost a decade and the Home Office hopes that it will provide police officers with vital leads in the first critical hours of an investigation.

It will be tested by London’s Met Police in a £113,000 pilot scheme, which ministers hope to extend nationwide.

Slow process: Previously analysing samples had been a lengthy process, but this technology will speed it up
