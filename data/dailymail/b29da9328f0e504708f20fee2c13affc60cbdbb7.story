Sham marriage scams are a massive loophole in Britain’s border controls and provide a ‘golden ticket’ for anyone wanting to stay in the country, a report has warned.

Most commonly, the marriages are between ‘awayday brides’ from Eastern Europe who come over for a few days to marry and then return to their home countries.

Their fake husbands are mostly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nigeria. It is estimated that between 3,000 and 10,000 fake weddings a year are taking place.

Undetected: A suspect is taken into custody during a UK Borders Agency raids into sham marriages

The report by John Vine, the chief inspector of Home Office watchdog Borders and Immigration, said: ‘Many register offices refer few, if any, cases of suspected sham marriage to the Home Office, despite the fact that they have a statutory duty to do so. This means that a significant number of sham marriages may be going undetected.’

One member of staff told inspectors that sham marriage was a ‘massive loophole in the immigration rules at the moment’.

Such was the lack of concern at being caught, many fraudsters still turned up for a marriage even when uniformed immigration officials were in the register office building.

Another loophole is the Church of England, whose clergymen are not required by law to report suspicious weddings. One senior Home Office manager said in the report that getting residency through sham marriage was akin to a ‘golden ticket’.

Loophole: A huge number of sham marriages are going undetected, despite a statutory duty for registry officers to report them to the Home Office

Borders and Immigration inspector 
Carol-Ann Sweeney told the Mail: ‘There are large, diverse cities in the
 Midlands and elsewhere where there are none or very low levels of 
reporting.’ She added: ‘It is much more difficult to deal with them once
 they have been married.’

Anyone
 who enters a bogus relationship successfully can use it to stay in 
Britain for five years and eventually obtain citizenship.

Mr Vine called for beefed up enforcement teams and more efforts to encourage reporting.

A
 Home Office spokesman said: ‘The Government is already taking action to
 crack down on those who abuse the marriage system to cheat our 
immigration system. And we are determined to do more.

Problem: An enforcement operation at Brent register office, north west London, found arrests were made for sham marriages nearly every day

If a sham marriage goes through undetected, the couple gain British residency for five years and can then apply for a permanent residency

‘Registrars
 have a duty to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office and 
we are working more closely with the General Register Office to increase
 awareness.

‘The 
Immigration Bill will introduce new measures to give our officers and 
registrars more time to investigate, prosecute and remove those 
attempting to stage sham marriages.’

Gerard
 Batten, Ukip’s immigration spokesman, said: ‘This just goes to show 
that official stats in immigration are totally unreliable. When such a 
senior figure admits to there being such gaping holes it’s clear to see 
how easy it is to abuse the system.’
