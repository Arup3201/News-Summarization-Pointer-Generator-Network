From stunning panoramic pictures of the red centre's Ayers Rock, to Luna Park's smiling face glowing alongside the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and even the dizzying highs and lows of the spectacular Blue Mountains in New South Wales, one photography company has captured it all.

Australian company Panedia has been specialising in 360 degree panoramic film and photography, interactive maps and video content for more than 15 years. 

This month it was announced that the company has had more views of its stunning 360 degree panoramas on Google Maps than any other company on the planet, amassing a total of more than 12 million views in only 11 months.

Panedia takes the images for clients which means both the photograph and the company  benefit from the exposure

Panedia takes the images for clients, especially if they are of a building, hotel, or landmark, which means both the photograph and the company or owner benefit from the exposure.

Company founder and lead photographer Aaron Spence revealed that they have been building a library of content for over a decade and now has more than 12,000 high resolution panoramas, each one geotagged at the location where it was photographed.

'This is the next big thing for landmarks, tourist destinations, the hospitality sector and businesses everywhere. Google Views is just getting started, the land rush is on to showcase places on Google Maps in stunning 360 degrees. Google Maps/Views is something we're very proud to be involved with. The opportunities in this space are endless, it's a very exciting time.

The company is also heavily involved in the emerging Virtual Reality trend, and producing underwater Street View content

'People are always looking up new places to travel to, or researching somewhere they're planning to visit, what to see and what to do. So they're seeing our content at a time when they actually want to travel. If someone is planning a trip to Sydney, they can check out the Sydney Opera House and other locations and views via Google Maps,' Mr Spence added/

'The beauty of the geographic platform is in its ever-increasing view count. Social posts and viral content go up fast, and come down faster, never to be seen again. Whereas geographic content on Google Maps remains relevant forever, always there waiting for when a viewer wants to travel.

'What we're producing is truly great for people to be able to experience places they haven't yet visited, or may never be able to visit,' the owner added.
