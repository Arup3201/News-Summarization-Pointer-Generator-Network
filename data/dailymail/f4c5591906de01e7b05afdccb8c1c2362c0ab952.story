Martin Kaymer added his name to a decidedly illustrious league of gentlemen when he completed his domination of the 114th United States Open by wrapping up an overwhelming eight stroke victory on Sunday.

The absence of any hysteria on the course meant a prized addendum to the history books off it as he became just the fourth European golfer in the last 100 years to win two majors by the age of 30. The other three were Seve Ballesteros, Tony Jacklin and Rory McIlroy.

The 29 year old from Dusseldorf is also just the third golfer in the last 30 years to lead a major from start to finish, with the others being McIlroy and Tiger Woods.

Anyway you look at it, therefore, this was right up there with the great performances and continues the recent domination of America’s national championship by the cream of European golf.

When Graeme McDowell won at Pebble 
Beach in 2010 it broke a 40 year drought. Now there have been four Euro 
winners in the last five years, with McIlroy (2011) and Justin Rose last
 year also successful.

‘I’m
 thrilled to have won my second major and particularly by playing so 
well,’ he said. ‘These are the moments that define your career and the 
way this week has gone has just been a dream.’

A
 special day in the annals of European golf was completed by the 
Sheffield teenager Matt Fitzpatrick, who sealed his own place in the 
history books with a fine last round of 69.

The
 19-year-old became the first man since Bob Jones in 1930 to win the 
silver medal for low amateur at both the Open and the US Open. There 
simply is no finer company to keep than the greatest amateur golfer of 
all time, and so no wonder he will make his professional debut at the 
Irish Open this week with a veritable skip in his stride.

As
 so often is the case when the day is all about history, the spectacle 
suffers. It was like that when Woods strolled away from the field at 
Pebble Beach to win by 15 in 2000 and when McIlroy won by eight at 
Congressional.

Kaymer 
was so good he never looked stressed at any point over the 72 holes.  
Back in April, McIlroy said golf was crying out for a player, in the 
absence of Tiger Woods, to take the game by the scruff of the neck. Now 
Kaymer has followed up his wire-to-wire success at the Players 
Championship in Florida last month with another dominant display. He’s 
also boosted his bank balance by £2 million.

The distant runner’s-up were Americans Rickie Fowler and the remarkable Erik Compton, who both shot 72s.

Defending champion Rose holed a long birdie putt at the last to finish 
tied 13th, the best of a disappointing UK challenge. He finished a shot 
ahead of Ian Poulter and two in front of McIlroy.

He might not have won but it was only right that those in the 
grandstand at the 18th rose as one to salute 34-year-old Compton. It’s 
almost seven years now since he believed he was suffering a heart attack
 so severe he rang his mum to say goodbye.

Compton’s father would later describe in moving detail the dark days 
watching doctors pound his son’s transplanted heart in order to buy 
time.

Tragic fate would 
work in their favour when a 26 year old organ donor called Isaac 
Klosterman was killed in a hit and run accident. And so it was that 
Compton underwent his second heart transplant.

Now Isaacs’s heart has found a perfect home alongside Compton’s will. 
It really is a sporting feat for the ages that Compton is out here 
making a living on such a competitive professional circuit. The fact he 
finished tied second in the US Open is positively miraculous.

Inspiring: Compton's impressive showin for second comes seven years after a near-death experience with his heart

Honoured: Defending champion Justin Rose, the best of the UK charge in 12th, does a Payne Stewart celebration

Flashback: Stewart did the famous first pump on winning the US Open at Pinehurst in 1999

Before he went out to play, Compton’s mum Eli received a note from Jeff
 Klosterman, Isaac’s father. It read: ‘Tell Erik we’re proud of him and 
to go for it.’   There really won’t be a dry eye in the house when they 
reach that part in the inevitable movie, will there?

When Fitzpatrick reached the 18th green, his caddy Lorne Duncan raised his arm to the heavens, drawing fulsome applause.

A momentous week that had seen him play with three Open champions of 
various hue in Phil Mickelson, Louis Oosthuizen and Rose had reached a 
grand conclusion.

Asked what advice he had for Fitzpatrick, Oosthuizen started laughing and said: ’He hits it so well he should be advising me!’

You could see what it meant to Fitzpatrick to be linked with Jones’s 
record. ‘I was told just before I went out to play and it really is an 
honour,’ he said.

For his
 parents Russell and Susan it’s back to real jobs in the real world 
tomorrow. Asked whether Matt still lived with them, Susan replied: ’Of 
course he does. He’s only 19!’

And what a future lies ahead.
