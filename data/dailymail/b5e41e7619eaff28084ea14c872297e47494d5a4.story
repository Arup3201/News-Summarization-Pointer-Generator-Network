Police say they received a call for help at 8.06pm.

Chicago's Department of Transportation is investigating the cause, however it is believed a break in a water main was the reason for the road to collapse.

The accident comes two weeks after a 14-foot-deep sinkhole opened up in a nearby residential area.

A leak in the water line was also blamed.

Naturally occurring sinkholes form when acidic groundwater eats at underground limestone, creating a cave in the rock.

No was injured, but the streets and basements were flooded with water.
