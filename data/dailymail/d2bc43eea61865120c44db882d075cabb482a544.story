Arrested: Kerrianne Johnson, 26, was charged with child molestation in Thomasville, Georgia

A 26-year-old woman accused of having sex with a 14-year-old boy was arrested on Friday after posting a message on Facebook saying how much she missed her young lover.

Kerrianne Johnson, of Thomasville, Georgia, wrote: 'I miss holding you at night'.

The parents of the teen saw the message and tipped off police. Johnson was charged with child molestation and released on bond.

Johnson was a close friend of the family and is alleged to have had sex with the teen at a local hotel.

The boy, who has not been named, was picked up from school by police and admitted having sex with Johnson several times.

Johnson also later allegedly confessed to sleeping with the teen at a hotel in Thomasaville.

Police said the Facebook postings by Johnson led to the investigation.

'One of them said, 'I miss holding you at night,' and it just didn't sound right; and the person who saw it was concerned and we followed up and found that type of activity was going on,' said Lt. Tim Watkins, chief investigator with the Thomas County Sheriff's Office.

Watkins said the teen's family and Johnson were friends.

'She knew the family,' Lt. Watkins said. 'I believe the family felt comfortable her being around the young man, but it happened at a local hotel where she rented a room.'

Johnson was arrested Friday and taken to Thomas County Jail.

She was released on bond and is under court order to not have any contact with the 14-year-old.
