Defending 110m hurdles champion Andy Turner was 'devastated' after crashing out of the Commonwealth Games in qualifying on Tuesday.

The 33-year-old hit the first and second hurdles and failed to complete the race in what could be his last season on the track.

Turner, a former world bronze medallist, insisted he was determined 'not to go out like this' and hoped to redeem himself at next month's European Championships in Zurich.

He added: 'It's one of the most devastating days on the track. I injured two of my Achilles tendons last year, my mum passed away and this is my first Championship back.

'I never thought I would be here in the first place but I don't just want to make up the numbers or do mistakes like that, I want to push to win a medal.

'But I made a crucial mistake at the first hurdle and that cost me even finishing the race. I haven't made that mistake all year and, to do it here, it's a schoolboy mistake.

'I have been thinking about calling it a day for a while, but I'll go to the Europeans and see how it goes. There comes a time when you've got to start thinking about other things and its been on my mind for a while now.'
