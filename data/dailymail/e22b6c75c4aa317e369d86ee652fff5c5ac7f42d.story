Villagers in Thailand held a Google Street View worker after suspecting he was a government spy.

About 20 residents in the remote Sa-eab village in Phrae province blocked the marked Google car on Tuesday after becoming convinced the worker was surveying for an unwanted dam project.

The Google worker, named as Deeprom Phongphon, was only believed after swearing in a Buddhist temple that he did not work for the government.

The car aroused suspicion as it toured the streets of the rural village with its large camera attached to the roof.

The Manager newspaper reported that the 
villagers took the vehicle's driver to a local office to quiz him, then 
to a temple where they made him swear on a statue of Buddha that he was 
not working for the dam project.

Residents said he would face bad luck within a week if he lied in front of the statue.

'The villagers were definitely not happy. The car looked very strange 
and had something on the top - there was also all kinds of equipment 
inside the car,' Wichai Ruksapon, 64, told AFP.

Google's regional communications manager Taj Meadows said yesterday that the company was aware of the incident.

The Prachatai news website said the villagers released the driver and later apologized to him and to Google.

Sa-eab village, 385 miles north of Bangkok, is known for its long-running dam protests by villagers and environmental groups.

'(We) apologize to the official, to Google, as well as to the Thai people throughout the nation and to the citizens of the world,' the villagers' representatives wrote.

They explained that they were 'extremely
 worried and there had been so many repeated cases that convinced the 
villagers to believe someone was trying to survey the area in disguise.'

Google Street View has run into problems in some other countries where there are concerns it captures too much information that should be private.

The project's technology also scoops up Wi-Fi radio signals, and Britain's data regulator in June ordered the company to delete personal data it gathered that way, or face a contempt of court action.

'Embarking on new projects, we sometimes encounter unexpected challenges, and Street View has been no exception,' Google's Meadows said in an email, adding that 'Street View abides by Thailand's local laws, and only features imagery taken on public property.'

The internet giant project takes photographs to accompany its Google Earth map program.

In 2011, the Tourism Authority of Thailand partnered with Google Thailand to launch a tourism promotion initiative involving images of streets and top attractions in the country's major cities.

Thailand was the world's 35th country to have Street View imagery available.
