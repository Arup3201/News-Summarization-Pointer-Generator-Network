A former Miss England who was once taunted for her looks has returned to the beauty pageant scene to help budding models beat the bullies.

Jackie Turner, from Bournemouth, was tormented at school by her jealous peers who she said threatened to "slash my face and cut my hair off".

Now age 30, Jackie recalls the abuse was so bad she was frightened to go to school and almost gave up on her dream of becoming a model.

Triumphed: Jackie Turner is proud she didn't let bullies stop her modelling

Beauty pageant success: Jackie took the Miss Dorset and then Miss England crowns after her mother applied for her to take part by sending in pictures

She explained: 'I used to be really camera shy, I remember when I was eight I would hide my face if I saw a camera. My mum used to enter me into local modelling competitions without me knowing and one day I saw my picture in the paper and I had won. I realised then modelling was something I wanted to do.

'The bullying began when I started high school, girls from the years above would call me names and threaten to slash my face and cut my hair off.

Tormented: Jackie was bullied at school because of her looks

Taking to the catwalk: She didn't want the bullies to hold her back so took part in beauty pageants

'I didnâ€™t feel like I was different from any other girl, yet they treated me so horrendously. I used to be so frightened to go to school. They used to spread rumours about me that I was dating all the older boys and stealing them away. I even had drinks thrown over me.'

Jackie said she was too scared to tell the teachers and didn't confide in her family as she didn't want to worry them. As the bullying got worse, she started to turn down modelling jobs and became less sociable.

Her twin sister, Shelly, knew something was wrong and eventually the truth came out.

Jackie said: 'I was so lonely and sometimes I didn't feel like there was any other way out. Eventually my family and teachers intervened but I still didn't feel safe. I don't know what I would've done without the love and support of my sister and friends.'

After school Jackie went on to qualify as a beauty therapist and became a personal trainer whilst taking part in some commercial modelling.

In 2003 her mother, Terri, entered her into a beauty pageant, Miss Dorset, without Jackie knowing.

Jackie was terrified to enter such a well-known pageant after the years of heartache she had endured at school. But she plucked up the courage to take part and won.

Jackie said: 'I loved modelling and I thought it was time to follow my dreams properly again. I didn't want to let the bullies beat me.'

Follow in her footsteps: Jackie is organising the Miss Dorset beauty pageant this year

She then went on to take the Miss England crown meaning she could take part in Miss World.

'I was then entered into Miss World and was sent to China to take part. I came 17th out of 108 women which was such an achievement,' she said. 'People imagine pageants to be incredibly lonely but I've never met so many nice women. I was welcomed by strangers and made so many friends.'

After her positive experience, Jackie now wants to encourage other young women pursue their dreams and not let bullies stand in their way.

She's running this year's Miss Dorset competition so she can support girls keen to follow in her footsteps.

Moved on: Jackie said, 'I can't help but laugh now at the girls who used to bully me'

She said: 'I can't help but laugh now at the girls who used to bully me. But I wish I could tell the young, vulnerable girl I was back then that we would be okay. Look what we've gone on to achieve.

'I'm running this year's Miss Dorset as I want to help other young girls who have been subjected to bullying because they're doing something they love.

'I want them to know that they shouldn't give up on their dreams like I nearly did. Don't let them beat you.'

As well as giving support to the aspiring beauty queens, Jackie also wants to change the reputation of pageants.

'Pageants have such negative press. I want to change that, young girls should be able to be successful and excel in their own right doing something they love,' she said.
