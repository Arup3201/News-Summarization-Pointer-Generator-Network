England arrived in Sao Paulo full of smiles on Wednesday ahead of their do-or-die Group D clash with Uruguay.

Roy Hodgson's side could be knocked out of the World Cup if results go against them with a defeat at the Arena de Sao Paulo on Thursday.

But Jack Wilshere, James Milner, and even Hodgson were spotted laughing as they got off the plane following their flight from Rio de Janeiro.

The Three Lions will experience cooler temperatures in the south of Brazil; it's set to be 10degrees hotter in London.

And Hodgson will be keen for his side to play quickly against the Uruguayans, who also lost their first game in the group, surprisingly to Costa Rica.

Wayne Rooney is expected to return to the centre on Thursday, with Raheem Sterling playing more naturally on the left-hand side.
