A former reporter with CBS News is suing the U.S. Department of Justice, alleging she was illegally spied on and digitally monitored. 

Sharyl Attkisson's lawsuit alleges that the illegal surveillance took place while she covered stories on Benghazi and the Fast and Furious gunwalking case and refers to three forensic exams conducted on computers.

She is suing over alleged violations of the First and Fourth Amendments, and her husband and daughter are named as co-plaintiffs.

Attorney General Eric Holder, United States Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe, as well as 'unknown named agents' - including those at the Department of Justice and the US Postal Service - are named as defendants in the multi-million dollar lawsuit.

The lawsuit claims that keystroke monitoring was used on computers, Attkisson's passwords and data were hacked, and her Skype account was also spied on. Her personal and work email accounts were allegedly spied on, as well.

Additionally, the lawsuit alleges 'In June of 2013, the F.B.I. had opened a case on Ms. Attkisson's computer intrusions under the auspices of a national security issue, but it failed to contact or interview her. (Ms. Attkisson was unaware of the F.B.I. case at the time it was opened and for months thereafter.)'

Attkisson is seeking damages totaling $35 million, according to Fox News, which earlier reported on the lawsuit. Documents show that she is also seeking a trial by jury.

She told Fox News 'The Justice Department has not been very forthcoming with questions. The question is, will anybody ever be held responsible?'

Attkisson also told the outlet she and her legal team have 'pretty good evidence' the hacking was 'connected' to the U.S. Department of Justice.

It has been reported that Attkisson, who worked on stories about the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, 'resigned from CBS last March after complaining that she was increasingly unable to get her investigative stories on the air'

Fox News reported that 'Attkisson resigned from CBS last March after complaining that she was increasingly unable to get her investigative stories on the air.' 

However, according to POLITICO, 'Sources at the network said Attkisson's coverage of the Obama administration had become agenda-driven and led network executives to doubt the impartiality of her reporting.'

Last year, the U.S.  Department of Justice said of Attkisson's claims 'To our knowledge, the Justice Department has never "compromised" Ms. Attkisson's computers, or otherwise sought any information from or concerning any telephone, computer, or other media device she may own or use.'

In a statement to USA Today on Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice said 'We stand by our statement from 2013.'
