She may have been known as the Iron Lady, but Baroness Thatcher revealed an usually soft side when she wrote a touching handwritten letter to a nine-year-old schoolboy.

The former Prime Minister was replying to a note written on March 15, 1980 by  David Liddelow.

The young son of a vicar, from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had written to her asking: 'Last night when we were saying 
prayers my Daddy said everyone has done wrong things except Jesus.

'I 
said I don’t think you have done bad things because you are the Prime 
Minister. Am I right or is my Daddy?'

Softer side: She may have been known as the Iron Lady, but Baroness Thatcher revealed an usually soft side when she wrote a touching handwritten letter to Peter Liddelow schoolboy

Surprise: The schoolboy was shocked to receive a reply from the leader of the country, reported the Daily Express

A few weeks later, the schoolboy and his father, the Rev Peter Liddelow, were shocked to receive a reply from the leader of the country, reported the Daily Express.

Lady Thatcher had written a lengthy handwritten note, on white A4 paper headed '10 Downing Street.'

In the reply she noted Mr Liddelow had posed a 'difficult question' but said she 'would try to answer it.'

Quandary: Peter Liddelow's 1980 letter to Baroness Thatcher asking her the tricky question

'However good we try to be, we can never be as kind, gentle and wise as Jesus,' Lady Thatcher wrote in fountain pen.

She added: 'There will be times when we 
say or do something we wish we hadn’t done and we shall be sorry and try
 not to do it again!

'We do our best, but our best is not as 
good as his daily life. If you and I were to paint a picture it wouldn’t
 be as good as the picture of great artists. No our lives can’t be as 
good as the life of Jesus.'

In the final paragraph, Lady Thatcher added: 'As Prime Minister, I try very hard to do
 things right and because Jesus gave us a perfect example I try even 
harder. But your father is right in saying that we can never be as 
perfect as He was.'

Grown up; Mr Liddelow, now lives in Australia with his swimming instructor wife Leisa, 40, and children Emma and Jack

The letter, signed 'Margaret Thatcher' has been cherished by the Liddelow family ever since and became even more precious to them since Lady Thatcher's death this week from a stroke.

The quantity surveyor the letter had showcased Lady Thatcher's softer side adding: 'I think it 
showed that the Iron Lady had a warm heart.

'I remember being 
amazed and surprised that the Prime Minister, who was so important with 
such a busy life, still found the time to send a two-page, hand-written 
letter to a young boy and to tell him what his Dad had said was right.'

Correspondence: Mr Leddelow wrote similar letters to the Queen, left, and the then Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie right, also receiving short replies from both, but Lady Thatcher's was fullest

Mr Liddelow had written similar 
letters to the Queen and the then Archbishop of Canterbury Robert 
Runcie, also receiving short replies from both.

But it was Lady Thatcher’s reply which gave the most detail in answer to his quandary.

Her correspondence came at a busy time during her time in Office - it was sent in the year that Thatcher made a defiant speech to Conservatives at the party conference in Brighton.

In
 it she stressed her determination to stick to tough economic policies 
despite doubts expressed within Tory ranks and famously uttered 'The 
lady is not for turning!'
