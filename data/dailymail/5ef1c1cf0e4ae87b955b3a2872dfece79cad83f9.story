Former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers appears to have tweeted that he is going to write a book with a 'no holds barred version of events' of his 'recent exploits'

Former Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers appears to have revealed on Twitter how he is planning to write a 'no holds barred' book about his 'recent exploits'.

The announcement, made on an account believed to have been set up by the disgraced 63-year-old, came as it also emerged Flowers was still being paid a church salary of more than £11,000, despite being suspended.

Flowers, a Methodist minister for more than 40 years, was questioned by police for four hours over alleged drugs offences yesterday.

He was bailed after the interview in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

Under the username @PaulFlowersRVD, Flowers is believed to have tweeted: 'Going to write a book on my recent exploits, A no holds barred version of events' (sic).

MailOnline previously reported how Flowers was understood to have taken to Twitter to apologise for his antics and to pledge to go to rehab.

Although Flowers did not respond to requests to confirm that he was behind the account on the social networking sites, sources close to the minister said that it was genuine.

The cleric also used the same photograph of him standing beside a Christmas tree as on his newly-created Facebook account.

A spokesman for the Methodist Church meanwhile has confirmed the former preacher is still being paid for his role as a minister in the Bradford South Methodist Circuit despite not carrying out any of his duties while he is suspended.

The church also said Flowers was living in the church-owned detached house virtually rent-free.

Adding that the church would not carry
 out any inquiry until the criminal investigation was completed, the 
spokesman said: 'We understand people’s concerns and we take these 
allegations very seriously.

'Mr
 Flowers remains indefinitely suspended and we will conduct our 
investigation into these matters once the police and court process has 
finished.

'It is a 
requirement that a minister in an appointment in the control of the 
Church lives in a manse (a church-owned house) and this arrangement will
 remain in place during his suspension.

'He will continue to receive his stipend (salary) as is the usual process under such circumstances.'

Flowers served as a Labour councillor in the Little Horton ward in Bradford, West Yorkshire, for ten years until his resignation in 2011.

After his arrest it transpired that he had been forced to quit after inappropriate adult material was found on his council laptop computer.

Flowers, who faces investigations by both the police and City regulators, was exposed by The Mail On Sunday last November when he was filmed counting out banknotes, allegedly to buy cocaine and crystal meth.

As bank chairman and deputy chairman of the Co-operative Group, Flowers oversaw the bank’s activities throughout the lead-up to its near collapse after running up £700million in losses.

He is expected to be called to testify at investigations into whether there was any failure or wrongdoing at the bank headed by industry watchdogs the Prudential Regulatory Authority, an arm of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority.

Chancellor George Osborne has also called for an independent inquiry into the bank's actions, although that will not take place until the two watchdogs have completed their investigations.

West Yorkshire police said in a statement last night: 'A 63-year-old man, from Bradford, who was arrested in Liverpool in November as part of an ongoing investigation into allegations of drug supply offences made in a national newspaper, answered bail today at a West Yorkshire police station and has now been bailed pending further enquiries.'
