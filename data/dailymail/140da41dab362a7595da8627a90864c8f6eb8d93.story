Charges against 27 students recently accused of hazing have been dropped by Dartmouth College today.

Through its judicial affairs office, the Ivy League school had charged more 
than a quarter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity's members of violating school policy.

The members were accused of threatening physical harm to new fraternity members, putting other students in 
fear for their safety and/or engaging in hazing during the fall 2011 term.

Allegations: Senior Andrew
Lohse, right, claims SAE fraternity brothers forced he and other members to swim vomit. SAE's Dartmouth president Brendan Mahoney, left, said no such events occurred during the 2011 pledgings

Animal house: More than a quarter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon's brotherhood had been accused of hazing after a former pledge said he and others were forced to swim in a kiddie pool of vomit and other bodily fluids

The 
students also were accused of providing alcohol to underage students, providing 
drugs and/or providing alcohol to obviously intoxicated individuals during the 
same time period.

The charges were based largely on 
allegations made by former fraternity 
member Andrew Lohse, who went public in January with allegations of 
'dehumanizing' experiences he said he witnessed at the fraternity.

In a column 
for the school newspaper, Lohse said the fraternity pressured pledges to swim in 
a kiddie pool of rotten food, vomit and other bodily fluids; eat omelets made of 
vomit; and chug cups of vinegar.

He called those activities the norm rather than 
the exception on Hanover campus, and he criticized the administration for not 
doing enough when he made anonymous complaints last year.

Brotherhood: 27 members of the fraternity face identical charges, according to SAE's president (there is no suggestion that any of those pictured here face charges)

Taking action: More than more than 100 faculty members wrote to the Dartmouth administration, describing hazing as an 'open secret' and calling on the administration to set up a task force to address it

On Friday, college spokesman Justin Anderson said initial information 
presented to the college supported the hazing charges, but it didn't hold up 
under further scrutiny.

'Accordingly, all those charges against individuals have been rescinded,' he 
told The Associated Press. 'Organizational charges against SAE remain 
pending.'

The fraternity's former president, Brendan Mahoney, declined to comment 
Friday.

He has said that nothing Lohse described, and nothing remotely close to 
hazing, occurred at the fraternity in the fall 2011 pledge term.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon provides all of its members with anti-hazing and risk management education and, several years ago, launched a comprehensive anti-hazing program called We Stand Together.

By then, the 
fraternity had gotten rid of any traditions that would be "deemed problematic" 
by the administration, Mahoney said, and no current members of SAE were members 
in 2009 when Lohse was a pledge.

He suggested the charges were a knee-jerk reaction to bad press, a suggestion 
college administrators strongly denied. Officials also denied that the college 
failed to act on Lohse's initial complaints.

The college recently created a task force on hazing. Administrators also have 
said they see hazing as part of a larger problem, tied together with binge 
drinking and sexual assault, and have taken steps to address all three through 
the National College Health Improvement Project the college launched last 
year.

Apart from the college, Hanover police also have been investigating Lohse's 
claims, but Police Chief Nick Giaccone has said criminal charges are unlikely, 
in large part because Lohse is not cooperating with police.

Lohse did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

Ms Johnson, the college 
administrator, had strongly denied both Mr Lohse's allegation that the 
college failed to act on his initial complaints.

She said the administration already 
had been working hard to tackle the issue of hazing and was not simply 
responding to the recent allegations and faculty pressure.

For
example, the college hired a new director of Greek organizations who 
had been credited with turning around the fraternity and sorority system
at another college, has hired two sexual assault coordinators and is in
the process of hiring another alcohol and drug abuse counsellor. 

The
college sees hazing as part of a larger problem, tied together with 
binge drinking and sexual assault, and has taken steps to address all 
three through the National College Health Improvement Project it 
launched last year.

'Clearly we put our resources where our mouth is,' she said.

'This idea that we have somehow thrown up our hands, said there's nothing we can do about hazing or other high risk behaviour going on college campuses is a complete mischaracterization.'

Ms Johnson also said college officials did everything they could when Mr Lohse made his anonymous complaints, but the tips he provided didn't pan out.

There are credibility issues surrounding
Mr Lohse’s  include Mr Lohse's 2010 arrest and conviction for cocaine 
possession and witness tampering and a 2011 disorderly conduct 
conviction, following a confrontation with a security officer during 
Homecoming Weekend festivities.
