MAN CITY MUST DOMINATE IN EUROPE TO KEEP SHEIKH MANSOUR SATISFIEDJOSE MOURINHO HAS WRECKED ASHLEY COLE'S ENGLAND CAREER

Let me highlight three young English players who ended the Premier League season on a high, and who I would love to see build on that next season.

Firstly, Carl Jenkinson at Arsenal. He poked home his first goal for the Gunners at Norwich and then charged towards the travelling fans to celebrate like it meant the world to him – probably because it did.

He’s an Arsenal fan, from a family of Arsenal fans and having met him and talked to him I can confirm it is genuine – this kid is a Gooner through and through. If he wasn’t playing for them, he’d have been in the away end at Carrow Road.

Boyhood dream: Lifelong Arsenal fan Carl Jenkinson scored his first goal for the club in the 2-0 win over Norwich on Sunday

What a moment: Jenkinson has supported Arsenal all his life and realised a dream by scoring in a Gunners' shirt

It must have been so frustrating for Carl to watch Bacary Sagna picked ahead of him week in week out last season. Especially when you see the England squad and realise another right-back is needed.

I’m a big fan of Carl Jenkinson, I think he has the talent that can be developed and turn him into a top full-back for club and country.

From an England fan’s point of view, I hope Sagna leaves Arsenal this summer – he’s being linked with Manchester City. England need Carl Jenkinson to blossom at the Emirates sooner rather than later.

And how lucky are the Gunners fans? They have one of their own playing for them, and caring about the results and performances as much as they do. Whoever you support, you’d all love a player like that in your team.

First choice: Bacary Sagna has played ahead of Jenkinson in Arsenal's defence this season

Secondly, Dwight Gayle. As a Posh fan, I watched him at Peterborough United and even though he was only with the club a few months, and we were relegated in that time, it was obvious he had the ability to go higher.

Crystal Palace paid £6m for him - and in all honesty it was probably too much - but the critics couldn’t stop banging on and on about that transfer fee. Especially when it emerged Ian Holloway didn’t really know how to get the best out of him, and Gayle then got injured.

He scored Palace’s goal of the season – a stunning strike to win a Christmas fixture at Aston Villa – but I always got the impression Tony Pulis felt Gayle was too much of a risk while Palace were still fighting for survival.

Top form: Dwight Gayle has shown he can handle the pressure in the Premier League with a number of goals for Crystal Palace

Curled: Gayle fires home a free-kick to score his second goal for Palace in the 2-2 draw at Fulham on Sunday

Allowed to play a part with Palace safe, Gayle flourished. He didn’t just score goals, he took up positions, he made runs, he outwitted defenders. His finishing was fantastic.

He started only eight Premier League games for Palace this season, but ended up top scorer for the club. That’s some achievement for a player who was playing in the sixth tier with Bishops Stortford two years ago.

There is speculation Gayle will be sold by Tony Pulis this summer. I hope the manager has seen enough to challenge himself to turn Gayle into an international striker.

To be honest I would have been happier seeing Gayle on Roy Hodgson’s World Cup standby list ahead of Andy Carroll.

On call: Dwight Gayle should be ahead of West Ham's Andy Carroll on England's stand-by list for the World Cup

Thirdly, another player who I felt was ahead of Carroll for England recognition: Sunderland’s Connor Wickham. For so many reasons he should have been on Roy Hodgson’s standby list.

He ended the season strongly, making a major contribution to Sunderland’s incredible survival run. But he has also represented England at several age levels, including 17 games for the Under-21s and he has tournament experience at that level as well.

His brilliant form at the right time should have been rewarded with a place on standby for the World Cup, and that would also be a way for Roy to tell young players if they do the business at junior England levels, that will be recognised at senior level. Leaving Wickham out makes me wonder if the Under-21s are worthwhile.

Wickham needs to bring consistency over the course of a season in the Premier League. I’m hoping he achieves that in 2014-15.

Fine season: Connor Wickham has been instrumental in Sunderland's Great Escape from the Premier League relegation zone
