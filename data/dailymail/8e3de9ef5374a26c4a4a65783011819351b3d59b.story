Manchester City paid Malaga £4.4million for goalkeeper Willy Caballero with add-ons set to raise the fee to £6m over the course of his three-year contract at the Etihad.

The Caballero deal was reported to be worth a total of £10m to Malaga but it has emerged that the figure is significantly less. City have had to be more prudent than in previous years after having their net transfer spend limited to £49m this summer for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations.

They signed midfielder Fernando from FC Porto for £12m and Arsenal defender Bacary Sagna on a free transfer before wrapping up the Caballero deal on Tuesday.

Signing on: The deal for Caballero could rise from an initial £4.4m to £6m

The 32-year-old Argentine accepts that
 he will start off as second-choice to Joe Hart, but club insiders have 
been surprised at his determination to oust the England international 
with Caballero refusing to settle for a place on the bench.

‘I
 know I am coming to a big club with a very good goalkeeper,’ he said. 
‘City already have a great goalkeeper in Joe Hart, but I will try and 
compete for the No 1 spot.

‘I
 knew that City were interested in me, so I tried my best for my 
previous club to make the move to a very big club possible and finally I
 have realised that ambition. Now I have to prove myself.’

Determined: Caballero wants to oust Joe Hart as Manchester City's No 1 goalkeeper

Time to strengthen: City boss Manuel Pellegrini is busy adding to his squad ahead of the new season

Caballero
 previously worked under City boss Manuel Pellegrini at Malaga, helping 
the Spanish underdogs into the quarter-finals of the Champions League 
last year.

He added: ‘The 
most beautiful moments of my career were under Manuel Pellegrini in 
Malaga, where we achieved big things. I like the way he works. I think 
his best quality is giving players the confidence to achieve their 
potential.’

City expect to 
conclude their transfer business with the signing of a centre-back, and 
there is an increasing possibility that they will turn to Roma’s Mehdi 
Benatia if first-choice Eliaquim Mangala does not express a greater 
willingness to move to the Etihad from FC Porto.

Business: Manchester City have already signed Bacary Sagna (left) and Fernando (right) this summer

Benatia
 is desperate to join the Premier League champions and is reported to be
 training on his own at Roma as the transfer saga drags on.

The
 Italian club have set a deadline of July 21 for a deal to be concluded,
 which is the date that both they and City go on tour to the United 
States.
