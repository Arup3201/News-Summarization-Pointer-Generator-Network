The Syrian air force killed dozens of children at a school when they dropped a 'napalm-like' bomb, according to a report by Human Rights Watch.

It was one of 56 incendiary weapon attacks carried out by President Bashir Assad's air force between November 2012 and September this year, the organisation said.

It claims that 41 civilians were killed in the attacks and 71 wounded.

Human Rights Watch is presenting the report to the Convention On Certain Conventional Weapons in Geneva this week.

Witnesses to the alleged school attack in August this year said a fighter jet had repeatedly flown overhead, as if searching for a target, before dropping the bomb.

Most pupils had been preparing for exams inside the building near Aleppo, in the north west of the country.

According to the report, seen by The Sunday Times, at least 38 people, including many children, were killed in the one attack.

A further 44 were wounded by the bomb, which allegedly contained a chemical similar to napalm.

A doctor, who treated the injured in a makeshift clinic, said: 'The strike hit the school not far from here.

'It was something similar to chemicals, maybe similar to napalm that causes big burns.'

Mary Wareham of the arms division of Human Rights Watch said in the report that the bomb weighed 1,100lbs and contained a fuel similar to napalm.

Bonnie Docherty, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, told the newspaper: 'There is a great risk of long-term damage in terms of disfigurement.

'These are some of the worst injuries I've ever seen.'

Napalm causes severe burns to skin, asphyxiation and death. It sticks to human skin and is incredibly difficult to remove.

The use of incendiary weapons against civilians was banned in the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons Protocol.

However, Syria has never signed up to the agreement.
