I’ve just met a guy online and we really clicked but he turns out to be a 32-year-old virgin! He’s attractive and it makes me wonder if he’s damaged in some way…

He doesn’t want sex and we’ve been dating for three months. What’s going on? Is it secretly gay? He says he’s a virgin but I don’t believe him…

Two unusual emails plopping into my inbox? Or an indication of something that’s more common than you think.

The answer is the latter.

Society views men as sex-crazed – willing, able and ready to have sex with anything that stands still for longer than a minute - but in reality, it’s easier for an older man to end up a virgin than you think.

Accidental virgins tend to morph into terrified virgins. He starts off feeling a little hung up about it then it becomes a big deal (posed by model)

Sometimes it’s deliberate: for religious or moral reasons, some men don’t believe in sex before marriage. Others see it as something special and don't want it diluted with several partners or want to marry a virgin and figure if they expect her to be, they should be too.

For others, it’s accidental: this guy simply missed the point when everyone else did ‘it’.  Maybe his girlfriend was less keen on putting out than other girls. Maybe he was less sure of what to do, so didn’t push it. Maybe he was shy or didn’t find it that easy to get a girlfriend until much later than everyone else.

The end result is the same: he’s still a virgin and all his friends aren’t.

Accidental virgins tend to morph into terrified virgins. He starts off feeling a little hung up about it then it becomes a big deal.

Terrified he’ll embarrass himself, he avoids making any sexual advances at all. Girls aren’t used to men not wanting to sleep with them so he quickly gets a reputation of being ‘a bit weird’ or ‘gay’ and before he knows it, he’s scared of dating and sex.

Add porn to the mix. It’s so readily available and prolific, men no longer need to go out and pursue women to satisfy themselves sexually. Why should they when they can stay at home and explore all their sexual fantasies online with no risk of rejection or ridicule?

Romantic relationships are stressful to lots of men. It was bad enough being an 18-year-old virgin, being a 30 or 40-year-old one seems unbearable.

Older male virgins look to their partner to teach them and with time and patience, could mould into your idea of the perfect lover

The longer a guy stays a virgin, the more difficult it becomes to lose it. He becomes adept at hiding what feels like a hideous secret, loses all confidence and suddenly he’s landed where he is now - fast approaching middle-age without ever having had sexual intercourse.

Should you go there if you come across this guy?

Some women claim being the first to introduce a man to the pleasures of sex is the ultimate in sexual head-games, a lusty sensation unlike anything else they've experienced.

Virgins pay attention and listen. There are a lot of guys out there who think they're great lovers - but they're not. Tell them they're doing something wrong and they get offended. With a virgin, it's usually different. They look to their partner to teach them and with time and patience, could mould into your idea of the perfect lover!

But sleeping with a virgin is a risk emotionally because it’s common for male virgins to move on quickly once they have done the deed.

'I associate my first time with embarrassment, feeling inadequate and shameful. I’d rather forget the person who witnessed that,' said one man who lost his virginity at 34.

Proceed - but with caution.
