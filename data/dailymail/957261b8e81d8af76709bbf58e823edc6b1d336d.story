Zlatan Ibrahimovic is in contention to defend his crown for scoring goal of the year, after being nominated for the 2014 Puskas Award.

The 33-year-old is part of a 10-person shortlist, comprised by FIFA, for his strike against Bastia in Ligue 1 for French giants Paris Saint-Germain.

The Sweden international won the prestigious award last year after netting a stunning 30-yard overhead kick for his country in a 4-2 friendly win against England.

Ibrahimovic is joined by the likes of Diego Costa and Robin van Persie on the 10-person shortlist after FIFA whittled down the thousands of goals scored around the world between October 3 2013 to 26 September.

Fans have up until December 1 to vote on FIFA's official website where the 10 nominees become three.

Established in 2009, the Puskas award, in honour of legendary Hungary and Real Madrid figure Ferenc Puskas, has been won by Cristiano Ronaldo, Hamit Altintop, Neymar, Miroslav Stoch as well as Ibrahimovic in the past.

In light of this year's nominees, Sportsmail reviews the top 10 strikes that have made the shortlist.

CRUZ AZUL vs Puebla (Mexico Clasura) - 15 February 2014

With the game goalless, and in its dying moments, Marco Fabian collected a high hopeful lump upfield immacutely with his first touch before losing his marker on the edge of the box. The end result?

ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC

PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN vs SC Bastia (Ligue 1) - 19 October 2013

The 2013 Puskas Award winner is on this year's shortlist after the most impetidous of backheel flicks against Bastia. The PSG captain met Lucas Moura's deflected cross with a moment of genius as his swing of his right leg ended up with the ball nestling into the far side of the net.

PAJTIM KASAMI

Crystal Palace vs FULHAM (Premier League) - 21 October 2013

The only Premier League strike to make the shortlist, Pajtim Kasami expertly chest-controlled an aerial pass down the channel before hitting a devious, dipping volley with his weaker foot from an audacious angle.

STEPH ROCHE 

PEAMOUNT UNITED vs Wexford Youths (Bus Eireann National League) - 20 October 2013

With her back to goal, Steph Roche collects a pass in her stride before unleashing a menacing left-footed volley on the turn. The fact that the ball didn't touch the ground once from the moment Roche touched it makes the strike all the more magnificent.

JAMES RODRIGUEZ 

COLOMBIA vs Uruguay (World Cup) - 28 June 2014

James Rodriguez was this year's World Cup top goalscorer and this strike illustrates why. Facing their South American rivals in the last 16, the Colombia playmaker collected team-mate Abel Aguilar's looping header on his chest from 25-yards out. One touch later the ball is in the back of the net as the 23-year-old swiveled and hit a venomous, dipping volley which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar. 

James Rodriguez's strike against Uruguay is the second of three strikes from the World Cup to make the shortlist

Rodriguez's strike helped him become the tournament's top goalscorer in Brazil this summer

CAMILO SANVEZZO

VANCOUVER WHITECAPS vs Portland Timbers (MLS) - 6 October 2013

Camilo Sanvezzo showed all of his athletic abilities here with this strike. With Vancouver trailing 2-1, Sanvezzo equalised for his side with an acrobatic scissor-kick from 10-yards out that flew into the bottom corner of the net.

SANFREECE HIROSHIMA vs Kawasaki Frontale (J League) - 8 March 2014

With eyes in the back of his head, the Sanfrecce striker flicked up a pass on the edge of the Kawasaki box to himself before lobbing the keeper with a volley on the spin. Ingenious play from Sato.

ROBIN VAN PERSIE

Spain vs HOLLAND (World Cup) - 13 June 2014

One of the iconic moments from this summer's World Cup as Holland thrashed the then-holders Spain 5-1 in their opening Group B match. Daley Blind hits a raking-long 40-yard pass intended for Robin van Persie. Running in between two Spain defenders, the Dutch captain meets the flight of the ball with a breathtaking diving header that looped over Iker Casillas in goal.
