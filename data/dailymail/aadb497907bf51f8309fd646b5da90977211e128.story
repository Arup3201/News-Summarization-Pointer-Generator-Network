This is the heart-stopping moment a champion rally driver became the first person to perform a 360-degree backflip in a car.

French daredevil Guerlain Chicherit, 34, sped towards a 25ft high ramp in his specially built Mini Countryman at an exact 37mph.

He then hit the quarter-pipe and took off, soaring 75ft into the air and flipping his car a full 360 degrees backwards.

Guerlain Chicherit spent four years training for the stunt that he pulled off successfully yesterday

The first time Mr Chicherit, 34, attempted the stunt yesterday he did so without crowds in case it went wrong

The French daredevil drove towards the ramp in his custom-built Mini Countryman at exactly 37mph

The professional stunt driver then landed rear wheels first on other side of the specially-made snow ramp the French ski resort of Tignes, in the Alps.

Chicherit's jaw-dropping stunt yesterday was the result of four years of preparation as he became the first person to successfully backflip a car.

He completed the first stunt in private on Sunday morning and then repeated the feat later in front of thousands of fans as a part of event set up by the Monster energy drink.

The rally star said: 'Before the jump it was crazy. I was alone in the car before the start and I just had to do it, everything was ready.

'I had to arrive at 60kph [37mph] and be full throttle in the kicker to get the right rotation.

'In the jump, I knew the balance of the car was good and it took me maybe 20 seconds to realise I had landed on my wheels.

The Mini Countryman landed rear wheels first in the deep snow after performing an entire 360-degree flip

Tense: After all his years of training, Chicherit said: 'Everything was ready; I just had to do it.'

Astonishing bravery: After successfully backflipping his car, Mr Chicherit simply posted on Twitter 'I did it!!! :-))))'

'When you attempt something nobody has ever achieved before, the stress is really high but the only way is to just try it.'

He added, teasingly: 'It wasn't the craziest thing I've ever done but for sure it's in the top three.

'It was sick - I just want to do it again.'

The backflip had previously been attempted by other drivers but Chicherit became the first person to land safely after flipping the car.

Guerlain is a professional action man who is best known to his countrymen as a professional rally driver, skier and champion freerider, or snowboarder.

He made a second successful backflip attempt last night in front of a crowd of thousands as the sun went down over Tignes.

The car had been specially built and modified for the stunt but no technical details have yet been released.

After his safe landings, the modest Mr Chicherit simply wrote on Twitter: 'I did it!!!! :-)))))'
