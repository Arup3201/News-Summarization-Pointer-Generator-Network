Outspoken designer Karl Lagerfeld, pictured, also blamed 'fat people' for France's public health deficit

Outspoken fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld is facing legal action in France after saying ‘nobody wants to see curvy women on the runway’.

The 80-year-old German, who is based in Paris, also blamed ‘fat people’ and their associated illnesses for his adopted country’s vast public health deficit.

Now a women’s pressure group called ‘Belle, Ronde, Sexy et je m’assume’ (Beautiful, Rounded, Sexy and fine with it) want to see Lagerfeld fined for his views.

Spokesman Betty Aubriere said they had filed a defamation complaint, saying Chanel’s creative director had displayed a ‘discriminatory’ attitude towards those with fuller figures.

It was during an episode of French talk show ‘Le Grand 8’ (The Big 8) on Channel D8 earlier this month that Lagerfeld accused ‘fat people’ of wasting the country’s tax revenue through their ailments.

He said ‘the hole in social security’ was all down to ‘diseases caught by people who are too fat’.

Lagerfeld also repeated his long held belief that: ‘Nobody wants to see curvy women on the runway.’

Ms Aubriere told French news agency AFP: ‘These insults by celebrities must stop. We’re sick of it.

‘There are a lot of young girls who don’t feel comfortable in their skin, and for them to hear comments like that is terrible for them.’

Ms Aubriere said it might only be Lagerfeld who ‘finds us offensive today’, but ‘who will be it be tomorrow?’

She said 500 people had signed a petition against Lagerfeld’s views, and many of them were plump young women who felt stigmatised.

Ms Aubriere said: ‘We’ve received messages from poorly young girls who are victims of insults at school and sometimes have to leave school.

‘We want to see preventative measures in schools so that people understand that curves are often an illness or are genetic, and are not a symptom of poor diet.’

Last year Lagerfeld caused outrage by attacking the British pop singer Adele, saying: ‘Adele is a little bit too fat, but she has a pretty face and a divine voice.’

The fashion designer has also attacked pop singer Adele, pictured after she won an Academy Award for the James Bond theme Skyfall. She replied: 'I represent the majority of women and I'm very proud of that'

In turn, Adele said in a magazine interview: ‘I've never wanted to look like models on the cover of magazines. I represent the majority of women and I'm very proud of that.

‘I'd lose weight if I was an actress and had to play a role where you're supposed to be 40 pounds lighter, but weight has nothing to do with my career.’

The cutthroat world of French fashion is notoriously discriminatory against fuller figured women, with only the very slim usually succeeding on the Paris catwalks.

The row today came as Naomi Campbell revealed she had confronted her friend Victoria Beckham about the lack of black models in her shows.

The supermodel, who has campaigned to expose discrimination in the fashion industry, wrote to several designers including the former Spice Girl, who included just one non-white model in her 30-strong London Fashion Week show.

She told the Mirror: 'I called Victoria and I spoke to her. I don't want to pin-point anyone. It isn't a blame game. Everyone's name was on that letter because they'd done it.

'It could have been completely unintentional. She is one of the designers on there like everyone else.'

The outspoken model was one of several who signed an open letter by the anti-racism Diversity Coalition, which also includes David Bowie's model wife Iman.

It has been addressed to top figures in the fashion houses of London, Paris and New York to attack the lack of non-white models in New York Fashion Week.

It lists 'fashion houses guilty of this racist act' and also includes Calvin Klein, Chanel, Armani, Gucci and Donna Karan.
