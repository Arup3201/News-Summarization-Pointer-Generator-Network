Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti expects Angel Di Maria to report for pre-season training on August 5 despite mounting speculation linking the midfielder with a move to Paris Saint-Germain.

Reports have claimed Di Maria will sign for the Ligue 1 champions for a fee in the region of £55million in the coming days.

The Argentina playmaker could even move initially on a one-year loan deal before signing permanently next summer in order for PSG to meet UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations.

Still here: Ancelotti, pictured at Saturday's friendly with Inter Milan, says no deal has been agreed for Di Maria

Pivotal: Real Madrid forward Di Maria was key to the club's Champions League success last season

Wanted: Louis van Gaal is a keen admirer of Di Maria and would like to sign him for Manchester United

Di Maria has also been linked with a move to Manchester United, with manager Louis van Gaal a huge admirer of the midfielder. 

'There is nothing new in the market,' Ancelotti said when asked about reports Di Maria was set to depart to the French capital.

'Di Maria finished the World Cup and he is resting.

'He will return on August 5 to start (training) together with his team mates.'

Surplus? Real have already signed Toni Kroos (left) and James Rodriguez (right) in midfield this summer

On target: Gareth Bale scored Real's only goal in a 1-1 draw with Inter Milan but his side lost on penalties

Real were beaten on penalties by Inter Milan in a friendly in California on Saturday after drawing 1-1 in normal time, with Gareth Bale on the scoresheet.

And Ancelotti believes he has a strong squad following the acquisitions of Colombia playmaker James Rodriguez and Germany World Cup-winning midfielder Toni Kroos.

He denied that the Champions League winners were still in the market for a striker, stating that Karim Benzema is 'very reliable' and Isco could be utilised as a deep-lying centre forward is necessary.
