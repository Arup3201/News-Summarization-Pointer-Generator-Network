Most commuters consider riding New York's subway in August unbearable - a daily torture that has to be endured to get around the city.

But one man has used the puffs of hot air from the trains to his advantage - and has transformed the underground into a Bikram Yoga Class for the homeless.

The teacher - comedian Fabrizio Goldstein, who also goes by the moiniker 'Fat Jew' - is passing on his skills to the destitute, by helping them limber up during the sweaty classes.

And breathe! The sweltering subway has been turned into Bikram yoga classes for the homeless

While most people will avoid the subway at all costs during August, the comedian utilised the heat to help the homeless centre their chi

The heat is designed to warm up the body, allowing the user to stretch into the postures - and the subway's high temperature seems to be helping the yoga class here

The New York subways are notoriously hot, making them the perfect - and, most importantly, free place to teach the classes, which rely on soaring temperatures to make the yoga student sweat.

The generous teacher braved the blistering heat to pass on his knowledge, the Crosby Press reported.

In a video, he can be seen telling people to take deep breaths, dispel their negativity and instructing them in various poses.

The writer and television presenter held
the classes every Tuesday - and his students seemed grateful to have 
someone take the time to help them 'energize'.

A Bikram studio is typically heated to 105°F (40°C) and has 60 per cent humidity - making the subway the perfect place to perform the postures

The students said they felt energized after taking part in the free classes, held beneath the city's streets

On his Twitter page, the instructor told everyone he would be exploiting the insufferable heat for the advantage of others

The diligent students and teacher can be seen sweating - although the comedian decides not to let clothes restrict him and performs the class topless.

On his Twitter page, the instructor told everyone he would be exploiting the insufferable heat for the advantage of others.

He tweeted: 'How hot is a New York City subway station in August? Hot enough to do Bikram yoga in. I'm teaching classes down there.'

Bikram Yoga is a unique series of 26 Hatha Yoga postures and 2 breathing exercises performed in a heated room.

A Bikram studio is typically heated to 105°F (40°C) and has 60 per cent humidity.

The heat is designed to warm up the body, allowing the user to stretch into the postures.

The combined heat and humidity also induces sweating, which is meant to flush toxins from the body.
