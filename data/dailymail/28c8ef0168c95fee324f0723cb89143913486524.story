Gordon Brown is being urged by Labour MPs to make a return to frontline politics and take on Scotland's next First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.

Senior members of Ed Miliband's inner circle are increasingly alarmed at the performance of 'unimpressive' Scottish leader Johann Lamont and believe Mr Brown could write a 'new ending for his political career' in Holyrood.

He could become 'the father of the nation', one insider suggested.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is being urged to return to frontline politics to take on new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon

The pleas came as Miss Sturgeon made history yesterday after being lined up as the next First Minister - making her the first woman to reach the top of Scottish politics. 

As nominations for the job of SNP leader closed, it was confirmed that no Nationalist politician had been brave enough to challenge Miss Sturgeon, who will now enjoy an official coronation next month.

In a move critics immediately branded 'unstatesmanlike', the leader-elect announced she will embark on a nationwide tour to speak to SNP supporters in the coming days - including an event at Glasgow's SSE Hydro. 

She also risked infuriating the majority of Scots who voted No in last month's referendum by claiming that Scotland will become independent 'well' within her lifetime.

Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday wrote to Miss Sturgeon to congratulate her and said he looked forward to working with her. 

The three main parties at Holyrood will now be led by women but there are ongoing rumours about Miss Lamont's future.

Although Scots strongly backed the Union in last month's referendum, the Yes campaign's triumph in Labour's heartlands of Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire - including in Miss Lamont's own seat of Glasgow Pollok - has alarmed the Westminster party.

But Mr Brown is credited with revitalising the No campaign and made the most impressive speech of the referendum campaign on the eve of the poll. The Kirkcaldy and Cowhim. denbeath MP hinted during the referendum campaign that he could stand for the Scottish parliament, although he has since played down the prospects of a return.

But a Shadow Cabinet source said: 'Everyone has come back from Scotland shocked by how bad things are in the party there. Johann Lamont is deeply unimpressive - she has got to go.

'My worry is that Nicola Sturgeon could be an even tougher opponent than Alex Salmond was. She has more appeal to women and we are going to find ourselves in real trouble unless we respond.'

The SNP angrily rejected comparisons between Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher

Nationalist MPs reacted furiously yesterday after Scotland Office Minister David Mundell congratulated Nicola Sturgeon on 'emulating' Margaret Thatcher.

Mr Mundell, Scotland's only Tory MP, cheekily told the SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson: 'I join the honourable gentleman in congratulating Nicola Sturgeon on emulating Margaret Thatcher and becoming the first female leader of her party.

'I most certainly look forward to working with her as the first female First Minister of Scotland. My previous experience of Nicola Sturgeon is that she has adopted a constructive approach to discussions with the UK Government.'

But, speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Robertson replied: 'There is absolutely no comparison between Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher.

'Nicola Sturgeon will be leading the most popular political party in Scotland.

'Margaret Thatcher destroyed the Tory party, and he [Mr Mundell] is the living proof of its having only one seat in Scotland.'

Another senior Labour source said: 'Gordon could go to the Scottish parliament for four or five years and become the father of the nation, like Donald Dewar was. We need He is still hugely popular in Scotland. The SNP are running rings round Johann Lamont.' 

One Scots MP said: 'There is real concern that we don't have leadership in Scotland. It would delight many if Gordon would take control.'

The Mail understands there was a 'gloomy' private meeting of Scottish Labour MPs in the Commons on Tuesday evening, in which the fall-out from last month's referendum was discussed.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt yesterday said there had been a 'fracture in the Labour movement' in Scotland, which the party now needs to move quickly to heal. One insider said the party was 'fearful' of a 'drubbing' by the SNP at next year's General Election, which could force Miss Lamont to stand down.

By then, 44-year-old Miss Sturgeon will be Scotland's fifth First Minister after replacing her 'mentor' Alex Salmond, who resigned after last month's humiliating referendum defeat.

Miss Sturgeon joined the SNP at the age of 16 and stood - unsuccessfully - to be an MP when she was 21. 

She stood for the party's leadership in 2004 but was heading for defeat in the battle against Roseanna Cunningham, prompting Mr Salmond to come back on a 'dream ticket' with Miss Sturgeon as his deputy.

She has been Deputy First Minister since the SNP's first election victory in 2007, also holding the role of Health Secretary until put in charge of the referendum fight.

'It is a privilege to have been chosen by the SNP to succeed Alex Salmond as party leader,' she said yesterday. 

'Alex is a hard act to follow but I am determined to lead the SNP - and the country - from strength to strength.

'I will work to ensure that the Scottish parliament gets the extensive new powers that Scotland was promised before the referendum. 

'I will always make the case for Scotland to be an independent country, but with the Westminster parties already backsliding on the delivery of new powers, my immediate job will be to hold them firmly to account - and I am today putting them on notice that I intend to do just that.'

Speaking to the BBC News channel, she said: 'I believe Scotland will become an independent country. I believe that's the direction of travel.'

Pressed when that would happen, she replied: 'I believe that would be well within my lifetime.' 

On the rise of women to lead Scotland's political parties, Miss Sturgeon said: 'It is significant - it sends a very powerful message... [but] I don't think we should assume it's job done on gender balance.'
