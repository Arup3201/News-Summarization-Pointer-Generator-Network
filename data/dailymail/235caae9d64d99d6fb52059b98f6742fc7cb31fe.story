David Cameron will 'never ever' go into coalition with Ukip, Downing Street aides have revealed.

The Prime Minister is facing an uphill battle to win enough seats at the next election to form a majority Conservative government, according to the latest polls.

But Mr Cameron would rather form a minority Tory government in the Commons than make a deal with Nigel Farage, it has been claimed.

Senior Tories are said to be 'increasingly convinced' that Mr Cameron will choose to govern alone if the Tories are the biggest party in the Commons but do not have enough MPs to form an overall majority.

Mr Cameron is growing frustrated with the number of Coalition rows between Tory and Lib Dem ministers.

Allies of the Prime Minister say he is no longer minded to make a 'bold and generous offer' to Nick Clegg in the event of another hung Parliament.

Mr Cameron will consider forming an alliance with a rump of unionist Northern Ireland MPs, but he has completely ruled out doing a deal with Ukip.

A Downing Street aide told the Times that Mr Cameron will 'never, ever' form a coalition with Ukip.

'A minority administration would be preferable to another coalition,' one insider told the newspaper.

Ukip are thought targeting up to 25 seats at the next election – which could see them challenge the Lib Dems and the Scottish Nationalists to be the third largest party in the Commons.

According to the latest opinion polling the Tories and Labour are neck and neck on 32 per cent - with the Lib Dems on just 7 per cent. Ukip are on 16 per cent and the Greens on 7 per cent.

Nigel Farage has previously said Ukip could prop up a minority Conservative government if the Tories agreed to a swift and fair referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union.

The Ukip leader accused David Cameron of trying to kick the national vote, planned for 2017 if the Tories win outright next May, 'into the long grass'.

But the eurosceptic party would agree to a confidence and supply arrangement - where it backs or abstains on budget and legislative programme votes - with a minority Conservative government in return for a quick and full referendum.

Mr Farage said: 'The price would be a full, free and fair referendum on our continued membership of the European Union, the opportunity to get our country back, and for that to happen quickly. Some time in July next year strikes me as a very good time to do this.'
