Professor Stephen Hawking has spoken out in favour of assisted suicide for people with terminal illnesses,

The 71-year-old, who has lived with motor neurone disease for the last 50 years, previously said he did not support the right to die as 'there is always hope'.

But in an interview which will reignite the heated debate surrounding euthanasia, the cosmologist told the BBC: 'We don't let animals suffer, so why humans?'

Assisted suicide: Professor Hawking said that people with terminal illnesses who are in great pain should be allowed to end their own life, provided there are appropriate safeguards in place

He said: 'I think those who have a terminal illness and are in great pain should have the right to choose to end their lives and those who help them should be free from prosecution.

'But there must be safeguards that the person concerned genuinely wants to end their life and they are not being pressurised into it or have it done without their knowledge or consent, as would have been the case with me.'

Professor Hawking was given just two to three years to live when he was diagnosed with his incurable condition aged 21.

Following a bout of pneumonia in 1985, he
 was placed on a life support machine which his first wife, Jane 
Hawking, had the option to switch off.

Motor neurone disease: Hawking in the sixties with his first wife Jane before he was confined to a wheelchair because of his condition. In 1985 she was given the option to switch his life support off when he had pneumonia, but she said no and he recovered. The pair later divorced after more than 25 years of marriage

But the celebrated professor fought back against the disease and went on to complete his popular science best-seller A Brief History of Time, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.

Only
 5 per cent of people with the kind of MND he has - called amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease - survive for more than a
 decade after diagnosis.

Referring
 to euthanasia in 2006, he said: 'The victim should have the right to 
end his life, if he wants. But I think it would be a great mistake.

'However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.'

Professor Stephen Hawking and his second wife Elaine Mason after their marriage received its blessing
