Jim Gaynor, 57, who bled to death at his home in Gateshead just days after undergoing surgery for throat cancer

A grandfather who bled to death just days after undergoing surgery for throat cancer was not warned of the dangers of the treatment, an inquest has heard.

Jim Gaynor, 57, a learning disabilities nurse, suffered from catastrophic bleeding and drowned in his own blood following transoral laser surgery to remove a tumour in his throat.

A leading doctor told an inquest that any future patients considering the surgery would be warned of the danger of bleeding to death afterwards.

His grieving family have questioned how doctors were unaware about the risk previously.

His daughter Ami, 26, a nurse,
said: 'It was positive to hear that doctors are already looking to make
changes, but my only concern is how nobody seemed to know about this 
risk of death before.

'Why had nobody looked into it? Why did it take my dad to die for these changes to be made?'

The inquest heard that Mr Gaynor had a 5cm by 
4cm ulcer at the left side base of his tongue, where his throat tumour 
had been removed, which had 'eroded' a branch of the carotid artery, 
causing catastrophic bleeding.

Leading an inquest into the death, Coronor David Mitford said he had not heard any evidence to suggest the transoral laser surgery Mr Gaynor had five days before was not properly carried out.

But rejecting the conclusions of a post mortem examination, which said the death was due to 'natural causes', he said the operation, and an ulcer it caused, were 'inextricably linked' to what happened.

Mr Mitford ruled that Mr Gaynor, from Gateshead, died as the result of the 'unexpected consequences of a necessary operation.'

Surgeon James O'Hara told the inquest that since Mr Gaynor's death he had spoken to colleagues around the UK about what happened, and discovered patients in Liverpool and London had suffered the same fate.

He said he now tells all patients set to undergo transoral laser surgery that there is a chance they could bleed to death afterwards.

But Mr Gaynor's grieving family have now questioned why he had to die before medics could recognise the dangers of the surgery- six years after doctors in Australia highlighted the risks.

The family point to articles written by cancer doctors in Melbourne, Australia, as long ago as 2006 in which they warned that severe bleeding could occur up to a fortnight later.

Mr Gaynor first felt a lump in his throat around Christmas last year and went to see his GP.

After initially being told it was probably just a swollen gland, he was eventually referred for further investigations, first at Dunston Hill Hospital in Gateshead, then the Freeman in Newcastle and eventually Sunderland Royal Hospital.

In February, he was diagnosed with cancer and underwent a neck dissection to remove the lump, which was seen as a success, and offered either chemotherapy and radiotherapy or transoral laser surgery to try and remove any remaining cancer.

Ami added: 'He decided to go with the transoral because the people he'd spoken to having radio and chemo were quite poorly, and he went in for it on April 4, four days after his 57th birthday.

'When he was discharged on April 8, which was a Sunday, my uncle noticed he was coughing in the car on the way home.

'He went to bed because he was quite tired, then got up and drove mum to work the next day.

'My sister Ashlee came home in the afternoon and a friend was there who had popped to see him.

'She could see his neck was really swollen, like he had tonsillitis, but at the time he didn't think anything of it.

'He started to cough, so my sister told him to go to the kitchen if he was going to bring up phlegm.

'He coughed up a massive clot of blood and started to gush like a fountain.

'He was hysterical and ran out into the garden, panicking and scared, saying "I'm going to die" and "Help me".'

An ambulance was called, but by the time paramedics arrived Jim's heart had already stopped.

He was taken to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary where he was pronounced dead.

Ami said: 'There was no dignity in his death. He knew he was dying and had to stand and watch it happening.

'I can't imagine what it must have been like.

'My mum Karen couldn't even go to the funeral because she was so traumatised by what happened.

'We had to stay with her for a fortnight because we were so worried. She didn't eat for about three weeks.

'When she turned 50 last month she said she didn't want a thing, not even a card. She didn't want to know because to her it just meant that she's got another 30 years without dad.'

Mr O'Hara told the inquest that there was nothing the family could have done to save Jim once the bleed started.

He said: 'If he had been in hospital, in close proximity to a head and neck surgeon - as nobody else would have been able to do it, not a nurse or a junior doctor - then possibly.

'Even then the chance would have been very slim.'

Ami said she felt like she was 'living in hell' since the keen golfer, a member of Stocksfield Golf Club, died and that his death had been particularly hard for her young son, Dylan.

She said: 'They were very close.

'Dad always wanted a boy and when I had Dylan he doted on him. He's only four and now he's going to grow up without his grandad.

'I've tried to work out what went wrong, but can't and it makes me really furious.

'It was less that 24 hours from him leaving the hospital to his death.'
