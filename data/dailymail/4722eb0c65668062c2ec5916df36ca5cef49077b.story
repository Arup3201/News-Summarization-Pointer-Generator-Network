They are two of the hottest properties in the Premier League, the South American hotshots who will surely decide Sunday’s big showdown between Manchester City and Arsenal. But which of Alexis Sanchez and Sergio Aguero is the better player? Martin Keown and Jamie Redknapp sat down for an appreciation, some arguing and a very difficult decision...

So, what is it that makes them so dangerous?

MARTIN KEOWN: They are fantastic all-round footballers but it’s their ability to run at players and terrorise defenders that makes them so good. They love to fly forward and are able to change direction in an instant — it’s that speed of thought and technique that strikes fear into opponents. They can absolutely embarrass players with their pace but almost always produce something special at the end of it.

JAMIE REDKNAPP: There are similarities in their game but I think they’re quite different in terms of their movement. Sanchez is perpetual motion and does not stop running whereas Aguero is much more economical. He is a predator. He will run, stop a defender, then go again. He waits for his moment and, bang, he’s in. Sanchez is different — he chases lost causes all over the pitch. It’s a cliche to say he covers every blade of grass but with Sanchez, it’s nearly true.

Alexis Sanchez's never-say-die attitude and his constant running are one of the Chilean's many attributes 

Both Sanchez and Aguero are vital to their respective sides - but who will emerge victorious on Sunday?

Who would you rather have playing for you?

REDKNAPP: Great question and one I really have to think about. I like to show Sanchez to my kids and encourage them to play that way — the desire he shows is incredible. He always wants to make things happen and I love that. But, if you’re talking about both players at the height of their game, I think Aguero would just pip it for me. There is hardly anything in it, and that’s testament to how well Sanchez has done because I’m a huge Aguero fan. And Aguero’s finishing would give my team the edge — he is more decisive.

KEOWN: I’d tend to agree. Aguero is up there with the best strikers we have ever seen in the Premier League. Since arriving in this country three-and-a-half years ago, he has performed at a consistently high level, at least when he’s not had injury problems. Sanchez has made a sensational start but it’s still early days for him.

Many players take time to adjust to England, but Sanchez has already netted 18 times in all competitions

Aguero has a knack of scoring vital goals, as his stunning hat-trick against Bayern Munich showed

Who would you rather play against?

REDKNAPP: Neither of them! They would both be so difficult to mark but in different ways. In a way it might be slightly easier with Aguero because you know where he’s going to operate — in the six-yard box or within the width of the penalty area. Martin was as quick as anybody but I’m sure he wouldn’t have fancied chasing after Sanchez!

KEOWN: Definitely not! Even though Aguero is the better striker, I would have backed myself to deal with him in my heyday. I wouldn’t have to change my set-up against Aguero but Sanchez roams all over and does everything at incredible speed. You can’t run alongside somebody like that so the only way to deal with them is to take more gambles and get there early. As soon as he takes a touch, you have to be right there. It was the same with Thierry Henry. In training I would sometimes be overly physical to try and stop him because if he won the ball in the first few strides he was away. It’s the same with Sanchez.

Sanchez does everything at full pelt and would be a nightmare to mark, says Keown

Aguero is a poacher who operates largely inside the box, but Keown backed himself to deal with the striker

What are there strongest assets?

KEOWN: They are both blessed with a hunger to win matches, but it is more obvious with Sanchez. The fans love him because they see him chasing every ball and out-jumping players much bigger than he is. He works harder than anyone else and the harder you hit him, the more he tries. With Aguero, he is so good at sensing defenders around him. That lets him lay the ball off, hold it up or turn and drive on. His close control is exceptional and he teases defenders, drawing them in before whipping the ball away.

REDKNAPP: I agree. It’s that sharpness that sets Aguero apart. He is so explosive off the mark and I love watching him hold off defenders in the area. For Sanchez, he spent most of his time at Barcelona playing second- or third-fiddle, but now he is adored at Arsenal. That’s because of the way he puts opponents under pressure. Lots of foreign stars join the Premier League and wait for the ball to come to them. Sanchez goes out and gets it.

Do these two have any weaknesses?

REDKNAPP: With Aguero, the only weakness is his injury record. That has to be a worry for him and Manuel Pellegrini and I can sympathise. With Sanchez, it’s hard to find a weakness and that’s why he’s idolised at Arsenal.

KEOWN: Sanchez is a fine all-round player but he does have a slight tendency to overrun things. At the start of his Arsenal career he would almost play too quickly and not release the ball at the right time to his team-mates. Now he has ironed that out he is becoming hard to stop.

Who's more valuable to their team?

REDKNAPP: Aguero because his goals could win City the league. I’ve said before it will be a shootout between him and Diego Costa and I’m not changing my mind. Sanchez is important for Arsenal but Aguero can decide the destiny of the title.

KEOWN: I think Sanchez. People said City would crumble without Aguero but they actually narrowed the gap on Chelsea when he was injured. They demonstrated they can cope without him but if Sanchez was out I think Arsenal would start to wave goodbye to a Champions League place.

So, who's the better player?

KEOWN’S VERDICT: Sanchez has always been used out wide but is now taking on the scoring responsibilities of the modern winger — think Ronaldo or Bale. He could be key as Arsenal try to become title contenders. But, as it stands, Aguero’s longevity and scoring record gives him the edge.

REDKNAPP'S VERDICT: It’s such a close call. At their peak I would have to say Aguero but if Sanchez keeps going at this rate we might have a different verdict in the future.

Rob Draper: Sanchez

This is almost impossible! In terms of ability, finishing and technique it’s hard to split them. But I’ll go for Sanchez — he’s injured less often and for the energy he gives. When you see your star player working that hard, you follow the example.

Neil Ashton: Aguero

His hat-trick against Bayern Munich in the Champions League was special. He also kept his cool with the last chance of the game against QPR to win the title for Manchester City in 2012. Sanchez has been brilliant but Aguero is ruthless.

Chris Wheeler: Sanchez

ON current form, it would have to be Sanchez — not least because he can stay fit. Aguero is the better finisher but he misses a large portion of games with injuries. Sanchez has set the Premier League alight and offers his ability to play across the front.

Laurie Whitwell: Aguero

Close call but the City striker edges it due to his frightening ability to score whatever the circumstances. No matter how tight an angle or implausible a path to goal, he finds a way. Sanchez has been shut out on a few occasions when Aguero would have netted.

Sami Mokbel: Sanchez

It's close, because they are two brilliant footballers. But the Arsenal star is more of an all-rounder. Aguero’s game is about scoring goals — but Sanchez has been doing that and more since his arrived in the Premier League this summer. So Sanchez — but only just.

Sam Cunningham: Aguero

When Aguero is fit and firing he is virtually unstoppable. At the start of the season before his injury in December, he was beginning to be talked about in the same breath as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. Sanchez is a phenomenal player, but he is a level below Aguero at 100 per cent.

Craig Hope: Sanchez

Aguero is the better player, yes, but Sanchez does it every week — he’s never injured and has contributed to more than half of Arsenal’s goals by scoring or setting them up. You never know when Aguero is next set for a spell on the sidelines.

PS: Sanchez earned £30.3m last year — his Barcelona and Arsenal earnings supplemented by various business ventures in his homeland, Chile, including property holdings, stock investments, Fat Sanchez Burger restaurant chain, the Tocopilla Angels football team and Pure Wondersanchez vodka. In 2011, Aguero signed the most lucrative sponsorship deal in English football with Puma — worth £5m. He also has an endorsement deal with Pepsi.

Both players scored in the 2-2 draw at the Emirates in September and it is likely that they will have much to say when at the Etihad on Sunday

Aguero is a lethal striker, who can run at people and is deadly in the box
