Pearce issued a statement yesterday to Channel Nine News through his lawyer, denying that anything untoward took place between him and Ms Arroja.

'There has been speculation and innuendo in the media which creates the impression that our client had an inappropriate interaction with a female patron at a nightclub over the weekend. That speculation is false,' said the statement.

CCTV footage from the incident shows rugby league star Mitchell Pearce twice lunging at the woman at the bar of a nightclub in Sydney's Kings Cross then returning to his seat and laughing just minutes before his arrest at the weekend.

Channel Nine reported the 'visibly distressed' young woman, wearing a short yellow dress, had approached police and pointed out the Sydney Roosters and NSW player, whom security staff at the Beach Haus then escorted from the club.

Pearce allegedly refused to leave the premises and was arrested and escorted to Kings Cross police station. He was issued with a $500 infringement notice for failing to leave a licensed premises and was banned from Kings Cross for 48 hours.

A number of bar staff, managers and security personnel in Kings Cross said Ms Arroja was a regular along the party strip and they did not see her with Pearce in the hours leading up to the Beach Haus incident.

But the Origin star appeared far from distraught about the night's events, laughing his way through training with the Sydney Roosters yesterday.

The CCTV vision - filmed by 16 cameras inside Beach Haus - shows Pearce sitting on a chair inside the nightclub when a woman walks past him.

He grabs at the woman as she passes, but doesn't appear to make contact. He then gets out of his chair and lunges at the woman again.

'He starts to move towards her and then sits back down but then for some reason decides to have another go,' said a source when describing the incident.

'She was unimpressed and told police straight away.'

Pearce, whose place in the NSW Origin team to play Queensland on May 28 was under a cloud as a result, was at team training yesterday.

A Roosters spokeswoman told MailOnline the club had begun a complex 'information gathering exercise' following the incident.

The early morning arrest threw NSW Blues coach Laurie Daley's Origin plans into turmoil with the team for Origin 1 set to be announced next week.
