Hidden behind bamboo and hedges near Wimbledon Common lies an architectural gem - a futuristic house made of glass and yellow-painted steel, with Technicolor trimmings.

Built by celebrated architect Richard Rogers in 1968 for his parents, the south-west London home has been in the family ever since.

But now, for the first time, the single-storey property is going on the market and it could be yours... if you can afford the £3.2million asking price.

22 Parkside, in Wimbledon, south-west London, was designed by architect Richard Rogers for his parents in the 1960s

The Grade II*-listed property is on sale for the first time, with an asking price of £3.2m

Each end of the house has massive walls of glass looking out on to a courtyard and landscaped gardens

Lord Rogers, who designed some of the world's most iconic buildings, including London's Lloyd's building, Terminal Five at Heathrow Airport and the notorious Millennium Dome, once described the house as 'the most successful small project I have been involved in'.

The Grade II*-listed building, known as Rogers House, has an open interior with very flexible partitions - if, for example, the new owner wishes to create another bedroom.

It was this modernist project which inspired him to co-create one of his most famous buildings, the Pompidou centre in Paris, which opened its doors in 1977.

Rogers House, as it is known, currently contains a large open-plan kitchen, living room and dining room, three bedrooms, a bathroom and utility room

Lord Rogers (above), who turned 80 today, said: 'The house was built for my parents, a potter and a physician, and designed by Su Rogers [his then wife] and me'

Lord Rogers, who turned 80 today, said: 'Overlooking
 Wimbledon Park, and yet invisible from the street, is a single-storey 
modern house built for my parents, a potter and a physician, and 
designed by Su Rogers [his then wife] and me.

'I was born in Italy and spent my 
early life surrounded by beautiful, historic and modern architecture and
 this has had an effect on all my work.

'My mother loved to cook and so the 
open-plan kitchen is the heart of the house where family and friends 
could gather, very much in the Italian way.'

The freehold property, at 22 Parkside, is on the
 market with estate agent The Modern House - and currently contains a large open-plan 
kitchen, living room and dining room.

It also has a main bedroom, two smaller bedrooms, a bathroom and utility room.

Each end of the house has massive walls of glass looking out on to a courtyard and landscaped gardens.

There is also a separate studio and housekeeper's flat.

The property was granted heritage status in February - putting it in the top 8 per cent of all listed buildings in England.

Lord Rogers added: 'The approach used to 
design this building inspired much of my future work, including the 
Centre Pompidou, designed with Renzo Piano, and Lloyd’s of London, which
 has now been Grade I-listed.

'The house is made up of prefabricated
 components, principally steel and glass, which can be adapted to 
changing requirements. Today, my son Ab Rogers and his family live and 
work in the house and have adapted it to suit their needs.'

The main house, designed to allow an entirely flexible internal space, represented British Architecture at the 1967 Paris Biennale

The sale of the house coincides with the Richard Rogers: Inside Out exhibition at the Royal Academy in London.

The house is one of very few in Britain to stand comparison with the finest 20th-century houses in America and mainland Europe, and one of a very small number of modernist houses to have been given the Grade II* listing by English Heritage.

Although the design is rooted in the classic Modern style - established by the likes of Mies van der Rohe and Richard Neutra - in terms of its construction, it represents a radical departure from what had come before.

The main house, designed to allow an entirely flexible internal space, represented British Architecture at the 1967 Paris Biennale.

It has been described as 'the most technically interesting and visually striking house in Europe' (Richard Einzig in Classic Modern Houses in Europe) and 'a masterpiece from one of the most imaginative and exciting periods in private house building', according to the Culture Minister Ed Vaizey.

From Pompidou to the 'Cheese grater': Classic designs by Richard Rogers

Here
 are just some of the architectural wonders designed by Lord Rogers, who
 is noted for his modernist and functional creations...

The Pompidou centre (left) in Paris, with its vast library and museum, officially opened in January 1977; right, the Lloyd's Building, home of the insurance institution Lloyd's of London, is located at One Lime Street, in the City of London. It was built between 1978 and 1986

The Millennium Dome (now the O2 Arena), in Greenwich, south-east London, was plagued with financial problems due to a shortfall in visitor numbers after it opened in 2000

Known as the 'Cheese Grater', 122 Leadenhall Street (in foreground, right) is currently under construction in London
