A former policeman who claimed a £5,000 insurance payout for whiplash injuries was filmed cage fighting days after the alleged car crash, a court heard yesterday.

Valerijs Trifonovs, 31, said he had neck injuries so severe he was unable to take care of himself or his son.

However, after making his claim, an insurance company worker spotted a newspaper article showing Trifonovs taking part in a professional heavyweight cage fight in Liverpool.

Fight: Valerijs Trifonovs, 31, took part in a professional televised cage fight 13 days after telling insurers he had suffered whiplash in a car accident. He insists the accident was genuine and he was pressured into the fight

Fight: Mr Trifonovs' lawyers argued that the 'annals of sporting history' were full of stories of people who fought on despite serious injuries. At an earlier hearing his claim for £5,000 compensation was thrown out

The fight, which was just 13 days 
after the alleged crash, was broadcast on television.

The footage shows 
the Lithuanian bouncer, who was also a special forces soldier and 
policeman in Eastern Europe, lifting his opponent off the ground, 
holding him in a head lock and hitting him around the head.

 Insurance Ltd is pursuing contempt of court proceedings over the 
‘contrived’ accident in Kings Road, West London, in May 2010.

Court: The former member of Latvian police and special forces outside the High Court

If
 convicted, Trifonovs, of Potters Bar, Hertfordshire, could face prison.

The insurers’ barrister, Marcus Grant, told the High Court in London 
yesterday there was ‘no bona fide accident’.

‘What
 made this particular fraud memorable was film of Mr Trifonovs engaging 
in a cage fight 13 days after the alleged accident,’ he said.

He also said that a Honda insured by Quinn, which Trifonovs said  damaged his Toyota, could not have done so.

He
 added: ‘Mr Trifonovs maintained as part of his claim that he suffered a
 neck injury in the alleged accident that restricted his ability to look
 after his child, engage in DIY, lift heavy items, or manage his 
personal care for a month afterwards.’

He
 also insisted his injuries ‘prevented him from being able to go to his 
gym, and swim or play football for three months after the alleged 
accident’.

Trifonovs’ 
barrister Ian Bridge insisted he had suffered a genuine whiplash injury 
but took part in the fight as he needed the money and had contractual 
obligations to do so.

‘Looking at this superficially, it might bring a 
smile to your face due to the irony that a man should suffer a neck 
injury, bring a personal injury claim, and then find himself involved in
 a professional fight within a few days,’ he said.

Postponed: The Latvian national was allowed to have today's hearing adjourned to secure an interpreter

Televised: A county court judge last May was shown the footage of the cage fight in Liverpool, pictured

‘There was a purse available, tickets had been sold and a promoter had promoted him.’

After
 yesterday’s hearing, Trifonovs, who was beaten in the cage fight within
 a minute and a half, said: ‘I swear on my children’s lives that I had 
that accident.’

In May last 
year, a judge at Bow County Court, in east London, dismissed his 
compensation claim – ruling that the road shunt probably ‘never 
happened’.

This paved the 
way for Quinn to seek Trifonovs’ committal on grounds of contempt of 
court, and the case reached the High Court yesterday as the insurers’ 
lawyers tried to get their case underway.

But it was adjourned to allow Trifonovs to get full legal representation, organise his case and find an interpreter.
