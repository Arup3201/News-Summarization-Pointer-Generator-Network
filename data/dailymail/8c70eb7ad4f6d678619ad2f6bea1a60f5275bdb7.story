Criminal connections: Michael Jones, 17, is accused of being an accessory to first degree murder in the Lane murder case but police knew him because his name kept coming up in other investigations

One of the three 'bored' teenagers held over the murder of Chris Lane in a drive-by shooting was linked to a string of armed robberies allegedly committed with his pregnant girlfriend, MailOnline can reveal today.

Michael Jones, 17, who was driving the car and brought in by cops repeatedly after a spate of raids, one of the investigating detectives said today.

MailOnline can also reveal that James Edwards, 15, who Jones allegedly said pulled the trigger, was known to have a 'very short' temper and is 'incredibly violent'.

Detective John Byers told MailOnline that investigators recognized Jones' Ford Focus from surveillance footage and that triggered their search for the killers of the Australian baseball player.

While investigating three different armed robberies in March of this year, Byers said that the police 'kept seeing his vehicle, we got to know his vehicle'.

'(It was) the Ford Focus used in the drive-by shooting. The vehicle was known to us. That was one thing that helped identifying the vehicle used in the killing of Mr Lane,' he told MailOnline.

'I’ve not known him to be claiming any gang...I’ve been watching Michael Jones, in reference to some other crimes previously, in some armed robberies and with another gentlemen who’s been doing some second-degree burglaries.’

There were three armed robberies in Duncan within days of each other this past March, and that is when Jones’ face and car became familiar to investigators.

‘Whenever we executed a search warrant on a house where the armed robbers lived, he showed up when we were at the front door. They contacted him, because he showed up at a parking lot that was real close to the house, with his girlfriend— and she’s pregnant with his child,’ Detective Byers said.

‘As we were compiling everything on the armed robberies and arresting those responsible, his name kept coming up. We pulled him in two maybe three times, interviewed him and his girlfriend too.’

The girlfriend has not been identified but she was in court briefly on Tuesday before the hearing for Jones, Edwards and Luna.

She was sitting near Jones’ relatives and allegedly broke down in tears. She became so emotional that she left the room before Jones even entered.

Police knew Jones had ties to the individuals involved in the armed robberies, and apparently so did Chancey Luna.

One neighbor whose son was allegedly the group’s next target claims that Jones, Luna and James Edwards perpetrated the seemingly random killing as part of a gang initiation - possibly the Crips since the infamous group has a growing presence in the town - but police say it is slightly less formal.

‘The close association with all of these people, the armed robberies, and the ones that committed the murder, are all associated, they are known to be contacted by law enforcement,’ Detective Byers said.

‘I cannot say this is a gang, no. They knew each other, they hung out. They committed crime. Yes, by classification, to be called a gang, they have to have some kind of initiation and call themselves a certain name, but at this point I can’t say they are a gang.

‘The armed robbers are in jail, all three are in jail, I haven’t known them to be in gangs, they had their own group. These are closely associated, intertwined, between the armed robbery and the murder - known associates, with known contacts with law enforcement. Luna would be with this person at a traffic stop, and they were known to hang out together.’

Their full criminal histories have not been made public as they were treated as minors before the brutal killing.

It also emerged today from court documents that security footage shows that after the shooting, the Ford Focus was parked behind a hotel for a little over ten minutes, and Edwards told investigators that the boys were smoking marijuana while they hid the murder weapon in the car's interior.

Illegal: Edwards told officers that the group smoked marijuana behind a hotel after the shooting

The police report reveals that 17-year-old Jones admitted he was driving the car.

‘He stated to Lt Shoemake that Chancey Luna and James Edwards were in the car and that one of them had fired the gun and that he was not telling which had fired the gun but it was not him but it was either James Edwards or Chancey Luna,’ the report reads.

An hour after their initial interview, Jones said that he wanted to speak to investigators again and he inquired whether his father or a lawyer had gotten in touch. When the police officer said that he could not tell him that information, the teen said that ‘he could not tell Lt Shoemake who had shot the male because if he did he would get killed’.

The officer tried getting more information from Jones about the location of the gun - saying that he didn’t want it to get into the hands of a child - and Jones said that police would never find it because he gave it to someone else.

‘It is a .22 revolver and that is why you did not find any brass,’ Jones said.

He would not reveal that person’s identity but said that individual had siblings in jail, which led police to believe that it was Odessa Barnes, a person whose name had come up during the armed robberies.

Questionable ties: Detectives said that while there are pictures of Edwards (left) and Luna (right) throwing gang signs, they are not believed to be associated with any particular group, more like 'wannabes'

Jones said that while they were smoking marijuana, he took out the cold air induction in his car and hid the gun there, presumably for the other individual to take it.

While Jones did not seem to change his story dramatically during his police interviews, the new report shows that Edwards did tell two different versions of events - first saying that he wasn’t in the car at the time of the shooting and then saying that he knew who fired the shot but only because he was told who did and not because he saw.

Tough image: Police also said that Edwards (pictured), who posted videos of him tossing around guns and looking threatening, was a big fan of a rapper who promotes violence

That change of heart came after he met with his father in between two police interviews.

It was also not his only unusual behavior inside the police department, as officers saw him dance while he was being checked into the facility.

When Edwards was standing behind a desk, he ‘began to dance, he did some kind of dance motion,’ Detective Byers told MailOnline.

Mwanwhile, a 25-year-old woman named Christina, who would not give her
last name for fear of retribution, said that she has known Edwards through her
cousin and he was 'always around' growing up.

She said that he could be violent and would get in 'a lot of
fights'.

'A lot of it gang related. He would fight over nothing,'
Christina said.

'Gangs are always an iffy thing around here, and when you
don’t exactly have family to look up to - then for someone like that the gang can
be the only family he has.'

Edwards' father has been raising his son while his mother is
in jail for an unspecified crime.

Christina told of a recent incident where she ran into
Edwards near an apartment complex and either Edwards or one of his friends was
waving a gun around.

'I told him to put it away, there are three or four children
around and that is not acceptable at all and he put it in his pants and walked
away,' she told MailOnline.

Besides fighting, Christina said that she knew he 'has sold
marijuana in the past'.

When asked if she was suprised by his alleged involvement in
Lane's murder, she said: 'Not so much that, but I didn’t think he was possible
of taking it that far.'

Different instance: A friend told MailOnline how she recently saw Edwards put a gun in his pants after she scolded he and his friends for waving it around when there were children nearby (Edwards seen here in a picture from his Facebook account)

Edwards, 15, and Luna, 16 face first degree murder charges and will be tried as an adult but if found guilty, they still may not receive the death penalty even though it is allowed in Oklahoma.

Jones faces a lesser charge of accessory to first-degree murder and using a vehicle in the discharge of a weapon.

Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said that rather than being part of any gang, which had been suggested before, authorities believe the boys were just wannabes who were emulating the thuggish beliefs of their idols, with Chief Keef the most popular among them.

Today, Ford said: 'These boys were more into some rapper that goes around, his music is violent. More than gang stuff. One of the parents said something about rap.

'These boys have no respect for life or authority or society, it doesn't matter who it is. By one of their own words, they saw him go by, and they said, "there's the target" and they followed him and shot him. He could have been anybody walking down the street.'
