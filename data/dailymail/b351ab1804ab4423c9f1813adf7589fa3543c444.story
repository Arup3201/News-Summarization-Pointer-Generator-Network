Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said teaching at independent schools was an 'easy gig'

Labour's education spokesman was last night accused of denigrating hard-working teachers at independent schools by claiming they had an ‘easy gig’.

Privately educated Tristram Hunt also suggested he would sack untrained teachers if he became Education Secretary, and said he would not undo Michael Gove’s school reforms as many were built on Labour policies.

Many unqualified teachers work at private schools, but they can also be hired by free schools and academies, which are taxpayer funded but free of local government control.

In other state-funded schools, staff must have Qualified Teacher Status.

Dr Hunt, whose former headmaster, Giles Slaughter – from University College School in North-West London – was unqualified, singled out Brighton College for criticism on BBC1’s Sunday Politics show yesterday.

The day and boarding school has 39 teachers without formal teaching qualifications, including headmaster Richard Cairns.

It charges £32,790 a year for boarders and sends about 30 pupils to Oxbridge.

Presenter Andrew Neil said Mr Cairns ‘finds incredibly inspirational teachers who don’t necessarily have a teaching qualification’.

But Dr Hunt replied: ‘It is a very different set of skills to teach ten nice young boys and girls in Brighton compared to a class of 30 with more challenging circumstances, with special educational needs, with differing abilities.

‘Being a teacher at Brighton College is an easy gig compared to some difficult schools.’

Mr Cairns said he was ‘saddened that any politician should seek to denigrate my teachers in this way’. He added: ‘They are incredibly dedicated professionals who work long hours to bring out the very best in the young people in their care.

Dr Hunt said Labour would not allow unqualified staff to teach pupils (library image)

‘The school day is much longer than in the state sector and there is an expectation that all teachers be involved in the extra-curricular programme, including on Saturdays.

‘Pupils are encouraged to work hard and play hard, and their teachers are with them every step of the way. It is certainly not a vocation for the idle or the faint-hearted.’

Dr Hunt said Labour would not allow unqualified staff. Asked if he would fire them, he said: ‘We don’t think they should be in the classroom if they’re not interested in improving.’
