Relive Sportsmail's for minute-by-minute coverage from La Liga as Barcelona travelled to play Villarreal. Lionel Messi and Neymar featured but the show was stolen by an unlikely hero. 

Host commentator

They got there eventually... but Barcelona were a little lucky this evening.

Mistakes persisted at the back, and Villarreal hit the post three times.

Now it's time for Real Madrid!

90mins: Three minutes added... can Barcelona hang on?

86mins: But Villarreal come back into it! New burst of energy for the hosts, but Vietto fires his volley over from inside the box.

What a debut! Barcelona finally break the deadlock and it's the teenager who gets it.

Messi pokes his cross through the goalkeepers legs and Sandro Ramirez taps the ball in from a yard out.

Not his best goal I'm sure, but surely the biggest of his life so far.

77mins: Close again! Messi's deflected effort skims the post after a neat cut back from Dani Alves. Desperate, but strong defending from the hosts today.

75mins: Last throw of the dice for Enrique and he opts to bring on experience in the shape of club captain Xavi.

72mins: Villarreal should be leading. That's right. Pina hits the post from the edge of the box and Giovani's follow up is fired across goal.

Surely there's a goal in this one?

71mins: What a time to get your debut as a 19-year-old...

68mins: Barca haven't come closer than that. Messi is played through down the right and his cross finds Neymar in the six yard box. Unfortunately for him, his shot is somehow blocked on the floor by Victor Ruiz, getting anything in the way.

Think it came off his back in the end, anything to prevent that first goal.

66mins: Not many players strike a free-kick towards goal from nearly 40 yards. But not many players are Lionel Messi.

The forward's effort is dipping towards goal when Asenjo makes an acrobatic save... may have been going wide though.

60mins: Neymar is on and straight away Barca's pace quickens. The Brazilian passes out wide to Rakitic whose dangerous cross is hacked away. Then Neymar's near post flick on from the corner nearly finds Mathieu.

Impact.

56mins: I don't think Villarreal can last much longer playing like this. Barca have enjoyed over 70 per cent possession so far, and the hosts aren't even trying to break away right now. They're well and truly camped in their own half.

And what makes things worse, Neymar is warming up...

50mins: This time it's Barcelona who are defending nervously! New signing Mathieu has to get something on a dangerous cross but he so nearly diverts it into his own net... Bravo watches the ball onto the post.

Away we go again!

And while we're at it , here's the Real Madrid team to play Real Sociedad: Casillas, Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo, Kroos, Modric, James, Isco, Bale, Benzema

Goalless at the break then, Barca need to step things up a notch here.

Mind you, they do have a certain Brazilian on the bench...

42mins: 'Tasty' atmosphere now. The crowd cheer as Dani Alves is booked after complaining about a high challenge from Jaime Costa.

After starting brightly, Barca's pace has dropped and Villarreal are defending and attacking reasonably comfortably.

37mins: Pedro is booked after clearly impeding Giovani as the forward tried to break clear.

34mins: Villarreal still holding firm, and now looking dangerous themselves. When they do get the ball, they are playing it a little quicker than the visitors.

28mins: Barca so nearly net the opener, as Lionel Messi's free-kick troubles Asenjo. Trigueros deflects the goalbound effort further towards the corner, and in truth the stopper does well to divert it onto the post.

23mins: Short set piece from Villarreal and Giovani's cross finds his way to the back post... but how Victor Ruiz somehow misses! The ball bounces up and hits the defenders thigh from six yards out, looping over the bar.

What a chance.

19mins: Unsavoury update now. Last year a banana was thrown at Dani Alves at this ground, before the right back promptly through ait back and drew praise throughout the world of football.

Today, the Brazilian is being booed by the home fans...

15mins: Close! Finally Barca click into gear. Messi feeds Pedro on the left, whose stinging drive on his weaker foot is well saved by Asengo.

The hosts need to be careful not to give the ball away like that in their own half.

11mins: The tempo is set for this one. Barca having all the possession, with the odd counter attack from the hosts. Cheryshev (on loan from Real Madrid) and Giovani will trouble Mathieu and Pique.

6mins: Very nervy defending from Villarreal so far. First a hacked clearance nearly puts Messi in, then the Musacchio has to hack the ball clear after a dangerous cross from Pedro.

Looking good here, are Luis Enrique's Barca.

3mins: Barca starting off lively here, with two early shots. Munir's effort from a corner is scuffed wide before Messi hits a similarly week effort straight at Sergio Asenjo in the hosts' goal.

We're expecting to see Munir left, Messi central, Pedro on the right.

There's also a chance for new signings Claudio Bravo, Jeremy Mathieu and Ivan Rakitic to impress.

So, with just ten minutes until kick-off lets look at those teams.

Giovani will be the main familiar face for the hosts, the ex-Tottenham and Barca winger, while Neymar is back on the bench for the Catalan giants.

Andres Iniesta is out of action with a knee injury.

Asenjo, Mario, Musacchio, V. Ruiz, J. Costa, Pina, Bruno, Trigueros, Cani, Cheryshev, GiovaniSubs: Juan Carlos, Vietto, Moi Gomez, Paulista, Rukavina, Gerard, Espinosa.

Bravo, Dani Alves, Piqué, Mathieu, Jordi Alba, Sergio, Rakitic, Rafinha, Pedro, Munir, Messi

Subs: Masip, Montoya, Xavi, Neymar, Bartra, Sergi Roberto, Sandro
