Allerton Castle has been a home to English aristocrats for centuries.

But there was nothing noble about the scenes that unfolded when Premier League footballer Danny Guthrie chose the venue for his wedding.

As the champagne flowed, the celebration descended into a chaotic, drunken brawl between the families of the bride and groom.

One source revealed things got out of hand when guests began ‘chucking the lobster thermidor about’.

Guthrie, his bride Rebecca, their fathers and siblings were all said to have been caught up in the violence which involved punches, slaps and kicks.

Among them were the star’s sisters Madonna, 23, and Tanita, 21, and the bride’s sister Charlotte, 16. Guthrie’s father Sean and Rebecca’s father Roy Middleman were also allegedly involved in the fracas. Reports of the mayhem suggested Roy ended up on the floor and Rebecca, 23, was punched.

Police were twice called out to the 18th century mansion near Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, in the early hours.

Officers arrived at 2.25am following a 999 call from worried staff watching ‘a fight among a group of guests’. No arrests were made as the party was breaking up by the time police turned up.

But they were called back two hours later after Guthrie, 25, allegedly damaged a door to gain entry into the castle, where he was supposed to be spending the night in the bridal suite. Later police received a report of a ‘disturbance’ that took place on a bus taking guests away from the reception.

Midfielder Guthrie is out of contract with Newcastle United and reports of the violence will not help his search for a deal with another club.

Allerton Castle in Yorkshire, where police were twice called last weekend, is a popular wedding venue

The lavish wedding on Friday June 1 cost up to £40,000. After a 4pm ceremony in the ornate surroundings of the castle’s oak panelled Grand Hall, there were photographs and drinks before guests retired to a marquee for the reception.

The castle – once home to the Grand Old Duke of York – was devastated by a fire seven years ago as wealthy American owner Dr Gerald Rolph was nearing the end of an £8million project to restore it to its former glory. A further £5million was spent on repairing the damage.

A source said staff were relieved the wedding guests were outside the castle when the trouble began. But they were ‘shocked and disgusted’ by the behaviour of members of the groom’s family, from Telford in Shropshire, and the bride’s side, who come from Liverpool.

‘To say they behaved like peasants with money is an understatement,’ said the source. ‘They were obnoxious and disgusting. One could say it would be expected of a rough pub on a council estate, but then that’s probably unfair to council estates. It was more Big Fat Gypsy Wedding than our usual clientele.’

At one point, candelabra had to be removed from tables amid fears of a fire being started.

The castle has a bridal suite and three en-suite rooms for immediate family. Other guests stay at hotels nearby.

It was locked at 3.30am by managers John and Jan Cook, who live on the site. The couple were woken at around 4am by the sound of someone breaking in and allegedly found the groom had damaged the door. Police were called again but the families were allowed to spend the rest of the night in the bedrooms without further incident.

Mr and Mrs Cook and the catering company Dine have refused to comment.

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman confirmed they were called out twice although ‘no arrests were made’.

Speaking from the £800,000 home in Ponteland, Tyneside, she shares with her husband, Rebecca Guthrie appeared to deny any trouble. She said: ‘No, no, no. I don’t want to know, this is way beyond me, I don’t want this, this didn’t happen.’ Guthrie meanwhile tweeted: ‘Its been made to look a whole lot worse. Gossip gossip gossip.’
