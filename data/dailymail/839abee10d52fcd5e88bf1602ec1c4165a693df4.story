A church-going teenager overdosed on heroin after trawling illegal websites such as Silk Road – known as the eBay for drugs, an inquest heard yesterday.

Promising art student Sasha Steadman was found dead in her bedroom  by her mother, with a needle sticking out of her arm.

The 16-year-old had been using heroin for several months before the family went on a Christmas holiday to visit relatives in Miami, hoping it would break her addiction.

Sasha Steadman, 16, was found dead by her mother at their home in Bromley, Kent, on January 28 this year

After staying clean for three weeks, 
Sasha’s tolerance levels were reduced when she returned to Bromley, 
Kent, leaving her body unable to cope with the fatal injection on 
January 28 this year.

Croydon
 Coroner’s Court in South London was told the teenager had been using a 
special computer router which gives users unencrypted access to ‘dark 
web’ illegal sites, such as Silk Road, which sell drugs.

Sasha had admitted to taking heroin about four times a week to her mother

Her
 mother Claire Shaw said at the time of her death: ‘These sites fed her 
impressionable mind with their damning gospel of darkness, grooming her 
to perform what they wanted.

'They must be stopped.’

Mrs Shaw also revealed that Sasha had become obsessed with images of self-harm on social media sites.

She
 told the inquest she found out Sasha had been taking heroin the 
previous November when she found drugs paraphernalia in her bedroom.

Sasha admitted taking the class A substance about four times a week.

Mrs
 Shaw sought help from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, 
which was already supporting Sasha over her depression.

In
 January 2013 the Orpington College student was experiencing low moods 
when she visited her GP and had self-harmed by cutting her wrists.

But a
 year later, after returning from the holiday, it was felt her condition
 had improved, as she had been clean for three weeks.

Mrs
 Shaw told the inquest: ‘She seemed to be doing really well for just 
over a week when she came back … we were hoping she had turned a 
corner.’

Describing the day of Sasha’s death, she said: ‘There was 
nothing out of the ordinary … she was meant to go to college so I asked 
her if she was going but she shook her head and I said OK.’

Mrs Shaw returned at 3.30pm, called Sasha and got no response, but didn’t check on her for another hour, the inquest heard.

The art student's mother Claire Shaw said before the inquest that her daughter regularly visited photo-sharing social media sites where users post images on self-harm, suicide, drug abuse and eating disorders

She said: ‘She was lying on the bed.

'I took the needle out, it was in her arm. There was a sachet of drugs near her.’

Tributes were left outside the family's home in Bromley, Kent

A
 statement by psychiatrist Dr Peter Hollis said: ‘It seemed to us that 
she was self-medicating using heroin … to relieve stress and improve her
 mood.’

Police found two 
envelopes of heroin by the side of Sasha’s bed.

Sergeant Gary Schofield 
told the inquest that a search of her computer revealed she had been 
searching for ‘heroin usage and how to cook heroin’.

Expert analysis of the computer found she had also been ‘searching suicide on YouTube’.

She
 knew how to ensure her parents could not look at her search history and
 used a web browser with a special router to gain access to sites 
including Silk Road, the inquest heard.

Coroner
 Dr Serena Lynch, recording a verdict of accidental drug-related death, 
said: ‘On January 28 Sasha injected herself with heroin at her home 
without intending to die.

'It is absolutely heartbreaking … It seems 
sometimes she was more concerned with helping others and not making 
difficulties for other people.’

Silk
 Road Market Place, launched in early 2011, allows users to trade drugs,
 fake documents and other illegal items anonymously.

It was shut down by
 the FBI in October 2013 but is now running again. In the last month it 
had 13,648 drugs listings. It is not known where Sasha bought the drugs 
that killed her.
