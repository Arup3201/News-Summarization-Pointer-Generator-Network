Loathed by women and constantly ogled by men, Dana Adiva simply explains 'it sucks being pretty'.

The 21-year-old blonde from Chicago, Illinois, liked being told how attractive she was growing up, but when she hit high school she found her good looks became a burden.

In an episode of MTV’s True Life series titled I’m Too Beautiful, the aspiring pro wrestler says: 'The [girls] were extremely jealous of me, I would have hate mail [saying things like] "you should just go kill yourself".

Downside of beauty: Loathed by women and constantly ogled by men, 21-year-old Dana Adiva simply explains that 'it sucks being pretty'

'It got so bad to the point where I just stopped going to school.'

In a bid to make people see her in a 
different light she experimented with wearing glasses, dying her
hair brown and trying to gain weight.

However, each attempt at hiding her beauty failed.

Today she masks her natural features with layers of make-up and fake tan.

She is even planning on getting a boob job this summer.

Her family, especially her younger sister Nikki, argue her Barbie-like appearance instantly gives people the wrong impression.

Indeed, Miss Adiva says the endless attention she gets from lusty men nowadays prevents her from finding a boyfriend.

And when she does go on dates, potential suitors treat her as a plaything instead of taking her seriously. 

At one point during the MTV show she is seen meeting up with a man named Dom.

'He couldn’t keep his hand off me, I 
couldn’t wait for this night to be over,' she said after the rendezvous,
before adding: 'I'm hoping to find love someday but when you look like 
me it's not easy.

Words of advice: Miss Adiva's mom and sister say that her Barbie-like appearance gives the wrong impression

'My looks get in the way. . .  When I walk into a bar I'm used to every guy staring at me.'

But she says there are some upsides to being attractive, especially in the world of wrestling.

'I get anything I want basically. I 
literally get treated like a princess and I don’t really have to be that
smart I guess because I am my looks.'

British writer Samantha Brick published a piece on MailOnline in April 2012 titled ‘There are Downsides to Looking This Pretty’: Why Women Hate Me for Being Beautiful.

The perception of arrogance caused the article to go viral on social media websites and Samantha Brick trended globally on Twitter.

It got 1.5 million hits and nearly 5,000 readers left comments, many of which were negative.

Speaking from her home in the Dordogne, France, Samantha told the Mail at the time: 'I'm not smug and I’m no flirt, yet over the years I've been dropped by countless friends who felt threatened if I was merely in the presence of their other halves.

'If their partners dared to actually talk to me, a sudden chill would descend on the room.

She also said: 'While I’m no Elle Macpherson, I'm tall, slim, blonde and, so I'm often told, a good-looking woman. I know how lucky I am.

'But there are downsides to being pretty - the main one being that other women hate me for no other reason than my lovely looks.'

Samantha went on to make numerous television appearances and starred on Celebrity Big Brother.
