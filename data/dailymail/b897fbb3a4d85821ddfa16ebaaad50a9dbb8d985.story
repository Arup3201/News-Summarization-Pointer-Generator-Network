The self-styled viscount conned his mother-in-law out of £150,000 while posing as a shipping magnate

A self-styled viscount who conned his mother-in-law out of £150,000 while posing as a shipping magnate was jailed for 40 months.

Kirk Brown, 46, changed his name by deed poll to Vizconde von Hoehen de Bessarabia and claimed he was due a £400m inheritance, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

Pretending to own a shipping firm, the fantasist persuaded his wife's mother, Nicola Young, to plough £150,000 into the non-existent business.

He also convinced his wife's uncle, Richard Birch, to transfer a total of £116,000 into bogus ventures - one involving a Bulgarian ‘whizz-kid’ stock-broker.

Brown convinced his wife's family he was the scion of an obscure European royal family and invented ridiculous excuses when his scheme failed.

The ‘grandiose’ cheat once claimed that an employee had emptied the contents of his bank account and donated it to the Taliban, the court heard.

Prosecutor Robert Hutchinson described how Brown used the title of viscount, ‘purporting to be a member of a royal family’.

‘He married Miss Jodie Young, the daughter of Mrs Young, and obviously knew his mother-in-law pretty well.

‘What Mr Birch fell for on this occasion was the plausibility of the defendant’s story, because of the link to his niece.

‘The money came into a offshore account which he had called ‘Bessarabia Sovereign Holdings’.

‘There was always some difficulty and it was never the defendant who was to blame.’

Mr Birch and Mrs Young were sent faked bank statements by Brown in order to allay their fears.

‘It was a PDF document. Upon inspection of that PDF document it turned out that the defendant was the author of that file.

Later, he told Mr Birch that an employee ‘had embezzled all the money and sent it to the Taliban'.

Judge John Hillen said Brown’s 'manipulation, the false documentation that you created, the many lies, the many deceptions, [and] the many pretenses' in his  £266,000 scam meant prison was inevitable.

‘You had assumed the identity of a grandiose aristocrat, even a royal personage.

‘You lived a lie as, you yourself acknowledge.

‘At what point your life became a lie is not clear. It may have been at a very young age.

‘You had certainly assumed this grandiose position of an aristocrat or royal personage and you did so in order to deceive, to lie, to control and to manipulate the family of the woman which you were married to.

‘The sentence will be concurrent on each of the four charges - one of 40 months imprisonment’, the judge said.

Displaying none of the trappings of wealth, wearing a black suit and black trench-coat, speaking only to confirm his name and guilty pleas.

The conman, wearing a shabby black trench-coat and suit, remained impassive, speaking only to confirm his name and admit four counts of fraud by false representation.

Brown, of Farnham, Surrey, was jailed for 40 months on each of the four counts, to be served concurrently.
