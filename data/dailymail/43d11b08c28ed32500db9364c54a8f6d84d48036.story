Mario Balotelli's agent Mino Raiola has revealed that the Liverpool striker will not be making a return to Italy.

The £16million summer signing has had a torrid start to his Liverpool career, scoring just two goals while attracting criticism from the Anfield faithful.

Despite being just three months into his Liverpool career, the 24-year-old is already being linked with a move away from Anfield following a disastrous start.

Raiola, however, believes Balotelli will not be making a return to Inter Milan where Roberto Mancini has just taken the helm.

He told Gazzetta dello Sport: 'A return to Inter is impossible. Not for Mancini, but for other reasons of which it isn't worth talking about.'

'Even Naples. Mario does not return in Italy.'

Balotelli has been criticised for attending the boxing match between Nathan Cleverly and Tony Bellew on Saturday night as his team were in London preparing for the Premier League clash against Crystal Palace.

The former Manchester City striker was ruled out of Sunday's match with a hamstring injury, but that hasn't stopped Balotelli's ringside presence hitting the headlines. 

Raiola added: 'He lacks the goals, doesn't run well but it is a time that must pass. He now has this injury and we hope to have it resolved as soon as possible.

'The relationship with the team? It is perfect, the English journalists must not be part of his life.'

Without the injured Balotelli, Liverpool were beaten 3-1 by Crystal Palace on Sunday
