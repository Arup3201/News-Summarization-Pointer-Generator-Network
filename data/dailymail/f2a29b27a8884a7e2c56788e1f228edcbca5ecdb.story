These mind-boggling images offer a unique and fascinating view of otherwise ordinary rooms and their everyday contents.

They capture items that are a familiar sight in homes across the globe - from tables, chairs and plants to sinks, toilets, books and shoes - but all seen from below.

Artist Michael Rohde - who was inspired to embark on his project after being homeless for five months - said that, unlike 'simple' pictures snapped using smartphone apps like the ever-popular Instagram, his painstakingly created images offer a means of seeing things 'from a new perspective'.

Mind-boggling: The photographer places his camera on the floor in the middle of a room to capture pictures of the ceiling and walls, then takes separate pictures of every item in the room from below, before 'stitching' the two perspectives together

To create each piece Mr Rohde, a former mechanical engineer from Germany, places his camera on the floor in the middle of a room to capture the walls and ceiling.

The 52-year-old then takes separate pictures of every single item in the room from below, before using a computer to 'stitch' the two perspectives together.

He began with his own flat, before branching out to document the homes of friends and acquaintances around Berlin.

Mr Rohde, who spends at least six weeks perfecting each of his 3.3metre-long creations, regards them as a comment on control and power in society.

Bathroom from below: 'I like to see things from new perspectives', says Michael Rohde, a once homeless former mechanical engineer who created these pictures

Fragments of the everyday: Mr Rohde takes pictures of every single item in a room from below, like the guitars, plants, shoes, table and chairs visible in this piece

'The view of above is adequately known and the most popular in our society, because it is the perspective of control and power,' he said.

'But we also should know the opposite side.'

He said the seed for the project was planted when he spent five months homeless in 2009.

'Homelessness was my choice as I was having problems with government agencies,' he said.

'I collected all kinds of materials from abandoned buildings to make myself a place to sleep at night and photographed them from above. I felt this showed the perspective of control and power.

'Later, once I had my own apartment again, I turned this angle around and that's how the idea for 'From Below' developed,' he said.

'First I take fragmented, individual photos of the whole room from the middle.

'Then
I photograph each of the objects within it - cupboards, chairs, the 
entire inventory - from below, in a personal perspective, so to speak.

'These are combined on the computer to form one complete, multi-perspective composition.

'These are pictures for me, in the reason it's painting and not (classic) photography.'

Mr
Rohde, originally from Lippstadt, has been interested in the perception
of space and perspective within interiors as a theme for 10 years.

'I am not interested in things like Instagram, because most of 
the results are too simple, and big formats are important to me,' he said.

'I like to see things from new perspectives, look at the dissolution of illusion and confusion and focus on interesting details.'

Fresh perspective: Michael Rohde, a former mechanical engineer from Berlin, Germany, says his images of rooms seen from impossible angles are a comment on control and power in society

Never before seen: Mr Rohde's creations offer a fresh perspective on the home from a rarely seen angle, capturing chairs, books, boxes, tables and games in this picture

Playful pictures: The German photographer spends around six weeks perfecting each 3.3metre long piece, which include images of his own flat and those of his friends in Berlin

Impossible angles: The idea for Mr Rohde's project was sparked when he was homeless, and would take photographs of the materials he collected from abandoned buildings to make himself a place to sleep

Painstaking: Mr Rohde photographs the ceiling and walls of a room then documents every single item in it from below with his camera, before using a computer to combine all of the pictures into a single, composite image

Control and power: Mr Rohde has been fascinated by the perception of space and perspective within interiors as a theme for 10 years, he said

Room with a view: The photographer, who regards the view from above as 'the perspective of control and power', says 'we should also know the opposite side'

What lies beneath: This quirky picture shows a bathroom as seen from the floor, and a glimpse of a bicycle and wellington boots seen in a hallway
