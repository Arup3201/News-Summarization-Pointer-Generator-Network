A man has been hospitalized for gunshot wounds sustained just minutes after he left prison following a 15-year jail term.

The 33-year-old man, who has not been identified, was released on Thursday from Otisville State Prison in upstate New York after serving his sentence for weapons and assault.

Jerome Mack and Edgar Wilson, both 35, were charged with attempted murder today in the shooting.

A 33-year-old man, who has not been identified, was shot after leaving prison on Thursday following 15 years inside for weapons and assault charges

The released man had been given a train ticket to take him from the local station to his halfway house in Manhattan - but got into a car that showed up to give him a ride shortly before 10am.   

Police said the men were two miles into the journey when the car pulled over and a second man jumped out of the trunk and fired two shots. 

The vehicle, a white Hyundai, sped away and the victim was able to make it to Otisville Metro-North station where a transport worker called 911. 

The 33-year-old underwent surgery and is in a stable condition at Westchester Medical Center.  

The New York Post reported from law enforcement sources that the victim was shot by a man who he had allegedly snitched on.

The victim was able to speak to police and identify the man who shot him, authorities said. 

The two suspects were arrested hours later in Manhattan. 

Both men were arraigned before Town Justice John Goldsmith and sent to the Orange County Jail without bail on Friday.

The shooting caused a lock down for several hours at schools in the Mount Hope area of Orange County.
