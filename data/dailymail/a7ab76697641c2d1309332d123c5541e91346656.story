Arrested: John Binho Lee, 33, was arrested Tuesday after getting drunk and trying to give a child prescription pills on a flight from New York to Houston

Police arrested a drunk passenger on a JetBlue flight when the 33-year-old tried passing prescription drugs to a child.

An airline spokesman confirmed that John Binho Lee, 22, was on Tuesday night's Flight 581 from John F Kennedy airport to Houston Hobby.

Flight attendants reported that Lee had two to three cocktails during the flight and tried to pass pills to a child seated near him.

When the plane landed at Houston's Hobby airport, the passengers were ordered to stay in their seats.

'We could see some of the flight attendants conferring with each other,' one passenger, Jake Martens, told Click2Houston.

'They asked us all to sit down and the next thing we knew they opened the doors, and I think three officers got onto the plane and lead (out) a man,' Martens added. 

Police say lee had a perscription bottle on him with Xanax and Ambien, but 
could not prove the drugs were perscribed to him.

Officers escorted him off the flight and charged him with possession of a controlled substance.
