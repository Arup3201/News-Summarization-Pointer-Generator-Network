Kill the badgers: 'Any future Conservative government' would push ahead with 'a wider roll-out of the culls',  said Environment Secretary Liz Truss

Environment Secretary Liz Truss has promised to roll out controversial badger culls across Britain if the Tories win the election, calling bovine TB the 'greatest threat' to our food security.

Addressing the National Farmers Union conference yesterday, she said 'any future Conservative government' would push ahead with 'a wider roll-out of the culls', which have been fiercely criticised by wildlife groups. 

Her comments came as NFU president Meurig Raymond said the incidence of TB had decreased on farms in two pilot areas in Somerset and Gloucestershire where culling of badgers has taken place over the last two years.

He urged politicians not to make the controversial cull 'a party political issue' in the run-up to the general election, and criticised Labour for pledging to give up on culling.

Ms Truss pledged that any future Conservative government would 'take the difficult decisions to deal with this disease'.

She told the conference: 'It is shameful that under the previous government bovine TB increased nine-fold and we ended up with the highest levels of the disease in Europe. It is incredible that they would like to make the same mistake again.'

She said the Government's strategy included cattle movement controls, vaccination in 'edge' areas around disease hotspots, and culling where the disease is rife.

'We will not let up, whatever complaints we get from protest groups. We're in it for the long haul. We will not walk away,' she said to the conference, to applause from farmers.

Speaking to journalists after her speech, she said: 'I've been very clear we will continue with the 25-year strategy, and that does envisage a wider roll-out of the culls.'

While she would not say when the roll-out could take place, Mr Raymond said there was 'no reason' why - if the Conservatives get back into power and the strategy was still on the table - other areas would not be ready to start culling this year.

Mr Raymond told delegates at the NFU conference that in the two pilot areas TB incidence had already declined, adding that the reductions were 'not just by a small amount either - in the Somerset pilot area TB incidence on farms has decreased from 34 per cent to 11 per cent compared to two years ago'.

And he said: 'In Gloucestershire, vets are also reporting a reduction in TB in cattle too. And just two days ago, one of our Gloucestershire members was given the fantastic news that his farm is now clear of TB, for the first time in 11 years.

'He is very clear that the only thing that's changed on his farm is that we are now doing something to control the disease in wildlife.'

Mr Raymond also called for the next government to make food and farming a priority, in the face of a report which showed declining self-sufficiency of UK food production.

Research from the NFU released ahead of the conference suggested the UK's self-sufficiency is in a 30-year downward spiral, with 60 per cent of food needs met with produce from farms here.

At current rates, and with the UK population expected to grow to 70 million in 20 years, the figure could fall  to 53 per ent by the 2040s, the NFU claimed, warning it would have serious implications for the British economy, food security and employment.

In his speech to the conference, Mr Raymond said that in 1984 the UK produced more than 80 per cent of what the country consumed.

'If you like to look at it this way, our national cupboard lasted us well into autumn. By 2013, the cupboard was bare by August 7. If we go on like this we will run out by mid-summer.

'Who would want to lead the country down a path where we produce less than half the food we eat? This will be totally unacceptable to the British public and in no way in the national interest.'

Mr Raymond said polling for the NFU showed that 85 per cent of British people wanted to see supermarkets sell more British food, and nearly eight out of ten believed the Government should do more to ensure a secure and affordable supply of British food.

He called for measures to protect farmers from market volatility, including by making sure the food chain worked fairly, better regulation on labelling, preventing 'Nimbys' using the planning system to stop poultry sheds being built or alternative energy projects going ahead, and to 'sort out the mess' of reform to the European Union subsidy system that attempted to make it 'greener'.

On the run: The Tories say they would continue with their 25-year TB eradication strategy, which includes a roll-out of the badger cull

Anti-cull campaigners reacted angrily to Ms Truss's comments.

Claire Bass, Humane Society International/UK's executive director, said: 'The badger cull has been a very expensive, cruel and ineffective farce and Liz Truss cuts an increasingly lonely figure in continuing to defend it.'

She claimed that 'almost unanimous scientific opinion' described the cull as a failure.

And she said: 'This cull fails our wildlife by subjecting badgers to inhumane shooting; it fails farmers by promising a solution to TB that simply doesn't work; and it fails the public by wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.

'The rational, scientific and apolitical solution to bovine TB is happening right now in Wales: a combination of badger vaccination, improved farm biosecurity and stricter cattle movement measures.

'With the election just weeks away the Government has a short window of opportunity to reverse this disastrous strategy and win back some public trust in its countryside policies.'

In Gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot, falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB in livestock, leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there.

The Government claimed the low numbers in Gloucestershire reflected the 'challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation' by anti-cull campaigners.

In Somerset, where the other pilot cull has been carried out, a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in TB in cattle, with 341 culled, in a required range of 316 to 785.

In both of the pilot areas, a significant proportion were killed by the more expensive cage trapping and shooting method, rather than 'controlled shooting' of free-running badgers.

Ministers and farmers insist culling is necessary to tackle TB, which can be spread from badgers to livestock, with more than 26,000 cattle slaughtered in England last year and multimillion-pound losses.

But opponents say badger-culling is inhumane and ineffective, and alternatives such as vaccination should be pursued.

An independent expert panel concluded that controlled shooting of badgers in the first year of the cull was not effective or humane.
