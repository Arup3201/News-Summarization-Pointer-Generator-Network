'Tragic accident': George Dunning died after trying to climb back into a house was locked out of

A schoolboy who locked himself out of the house died after falling and smashing his head on the ground as he tried to climb back in, an inquest heard.

George Dunning, 17, had taken the day off school while he was ill and left the front door open as he stepped outside.

But the door closed behind him and he is understood to have tried to  scale a 6ft tall fence to get in through the back garden in Twyford, Berkshire.

The teenager was found by a neighbour slumped in the front garden fitting and bleeding heavily from the head, the inquest in in Windsor, Berkshire heard.

The inquest heard that George had been at home alone after his mother Wendy reported him sick to school after he was sick three times in the night.

Mrs Dunning range her son from her workplace to check up on him at around 3.30pm. He seemed confused and disorientated.

She left work early and returned to the family home to find her neighbour Hayley Bartlett hunched over George who was in a pool of blood and suffering seizures.

He was airlifted by air ambulance to the specialist head injury unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where he underwent emergency surgery but never regained consciousness. He died two days later, on November 30, last year.

Police investigated the death but were left puzzled as to what happened.

One theory detectives suggested was that George had locked himself out of the front door and had been trying to climb the six foot side fence to access the unlocked back door when he fell.

Fall: The teenager was found in a pool of blood and having seizures after suffering severe head injuries consistent with falling from a height

Coroner Peter Bedford concluded that this theory was the most likely when he recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest on Thursday.

Mrs Dunning told the coroner: 'We as a family are at a loss as to what happened. The only logical reason he sustained the injuries is if he had fallen when climbing the fence.'

Detective Constable Emma Smith said: 'It is not known why George had left the house. It is believed he must have been climbing around the back when he fell.'

The post mortem examination found that George had died from severe head injuries consistent with a fall from a height.

Death: The street in Twyford, Berkshire, where the teenager died after trying to climb over a 6ft fence to get into the back garden while being locked out

Coroner Peter Bedford, in recording a verdict of accidental death, said: 'While at home alone George has apparently locked himself out of the property. It seems to me he deliberately left the front door but that has closed behind him.

'It's logical that having found himself locked out, the obvious step would be to climb the wall and gate to the side of the property to access the back door.

'However, because he was feeling unwell and weaker than normal he has fallen and suffered a head injury.

'It doesn't explain all of the information but potentially it is as close as you can get to explaining these tragic circumstances.'
