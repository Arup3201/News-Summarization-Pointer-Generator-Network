They were worth £200,000 each and hosted decades of happy memories for the families who used them.

But a row of luxury seaside chalets at Monmouth Beach in Lyme Regis, Dorset, were destroyed by bulldozers in a matter of minutes after they were condemned following a landslide.

The wooden huts, worth at total of £1million, were left in a precarious positions after 500 tons of earth fell down the cliffs on which they were positioned.

Some chalet owners were insured but others will have to swallow the bitter pill that their holiday idyll is gone

Eleven chalets will not have their licences renewed because of the landslip

Having been deemed by the council to be unsafe, the owners were given time to retrieve what they could before demolition work began.

Pictures taken today show bulldozers moving in and knocking down what was left of the chalets which had to be removed to prevent them from falling onto other huts and causing further devastation.

Each hut is worth about £70,000 but due to the seaside location and the coastal views they enjoy their sell-on value is between £175,000 to £200,000.

The steady deluge from the landslip built up behind the cabins and pushed them forwards until they were precariously perched on the sloping cliff, with one even tilted up at a 30 degree angle.

The landslide has rendered the stretch of Britain’s Jurassic Coast so unsafe it has been closed off to the public.

The devastated owners were told by the local authority that the area was unsafe and had to salvage their belongings before bulldozers were brought in to level the chalets

Lyme Regis Town Council, which owns the land, announced it will not renew the licences for 11 of the chalets.

One owner said: 'Some people are covered by insurance and some are not. Luckily for us our property is.

'We
are only allowed to insure it up to £70,000. The total value of ours 
was £200,000 so the rest of the value is the location and the ongoing 
licence.

The holiday homes, that overlook Lyme Bay, can only be lived in for nine months of the year and are empty over the winter.

They are privately owned but the land they are on is owned by Lyme Regis Town Council which receives £2,500 a year in rent from each plot.

Monmouth Beach is named after the Duke of Monmouth, who landed there in 1685 during his attempt to take the crown from King James II.

Following the defeat of the Duke of Monmouth, twelve locals were hanged on the beach.

The huts, much sought-after thanks to the location, were heavily damaged by mudslides and condemned
