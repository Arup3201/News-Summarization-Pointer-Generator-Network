In time, this may be remembered as the day Manchester United were reborn. The Gaal-acticos have found their mojo.

It turned into a party, with 75,000 watching United move through the gears and give the fans what they want: goals, and lots of them.

United settled on four, even though manager Louis van Gaal was after more when he sent on Falcao to join Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney in attack for the final 23 minutes.

Radamel Falcao's arrival on the field was greeted with a rapturous reception by the home support

‘Falcao, Falcao, give us a wave,’ demanded the Stretford End when the forward arrived on the pitch and the Colombian duly obliged.

The build-up to his arrival on the field was momentous, with a whole stadium being swept along in the euphoria when Van Gaal sent his latest recruit dashing down the touchline to warm up.

This was like the old United as they piled forward in search of goals, flooding Robert Green’s area and firing at will. QPR never stood a chance.

Bravo Van Gaal, because the Dutch coach abandoned the disastrous three at the back and returned to the system English teams are most comfortable with.

A flat back four feels and sounds antiquated, but at least United’s defenders — Marcos Rojo, Tyler Blackett, Jonny Evans and Rafael — knew what they were doing.

Rojo offered certainty, a composed figure alongside the improving and maturing Blackett. In time, Blackett can be one of the best.

That’s the beauty of Van Gaal, because he has brought through some of the best talents in the game, Clarence Seedorf and Thomas Muller among them. Blackett is beginning to look the part.

For all their eye-bulging spending over the past year, United and their fans know how to look after one of their own. Sunday, in a run that stretches back to October 1937, was the 3,705 successive match in which they have named a homegrown player in the matchday squad.

It is early days for this new-look United, but this stadium responded to a team who played with purpose and pace. When you watch Angel di Maria contort his body to get past Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker, it is mesmerising.

Angel di Maria scores his first Manchester United goal, and, whether deliberate or not, it was deserved

The Argentinian winger was the stand-out performer in a superb Manchester United display

Di Maria was replaced on 82 minutes, given a breather after 95 touches of the ball. Many of them were jaw-dropping. When he influences a game in this fashion, it is easy to understand why Cristiano Ronaldo was so critical of the decision by Real Madrid president Florentino Perez to sell the deep-lying winger.

During the international break, Di Maria scored once and set up three in Argentina’s destruction of world champions Germany in Dusseldorf. This was another bracing performance.

He didn’t seem sure whether his free-kick was supposed to beat QPR’s keeper, but there was no doubt about the touch that led to Juan Mata’s goal.

It was a day for standing ovations, from the moment the team walked off at half-time when United were three goals to the good, to Di Maria’s departure, to Falcao’s arrival on the field. The fans wanted goals and now they have them.

‘Rooney, Rooney,’ they chanted when the captain drilled United’s third goal from the edge of the area just before the break.

United supporters have retained a sense of humour, singing, ‘We’re going to win the league’, as the ball kept rippling the back of Green’s net.

That seems a long way off, but Van Gaal is up and running after an uncomfortable start.

Only a couple of weeks ago, when United were beaten 4-0 at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup, the aura surrounding him seemed to be to wearing off. After this tub-thumping win, the doubts have evaporated.
