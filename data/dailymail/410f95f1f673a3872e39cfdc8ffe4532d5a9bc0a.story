Crystal Palace caretaker boss Keith Millen has said the texts between Malky Mackay and Iain Moody are ‘hard to justify’.

Moody resigned from Palace as sporting director in the wake of the allegations on Thursday.

Mackay was close to be being named Palace boss before Sportsmail’s extraordinary revelations regarding discriminatory texts between the pair.

Unfortunate: Millen's Palace side were unlucky not to get a point from their game against Arsenal

Spectator: Millen said he didn't want to get involved in the reported texts or their content

Speaking ahead of his side’s London derby against West Ham, Millen said: ‘I don’t want to get involved in the texts. That sort of language is not something you hear in football time. It’s hard to justify if it’s true.

'I had a chat with them (the players) about being focused. They have been through a lot of things together.

'He (Moody) was brought in to scout so the chairman will have to look at that situation and I've spoken to the chairman and that will remain private.'

And Millen was coy about the managerial situation at the club, although he insists he would be willing to have a crack at it.

Palace host West Ham United at Selhurst Park on Saturday and Moody is targeting three points following their opening day defeat at Arsenal. 

'Obviously if I can get three points my case (to be manager) is stronger,' he said.

'It's up to the chairman to decide who he wants. He knows what I can do it's just whether he feels it's the right time

'Keeping the players focused is okay, they are serious and focused. The lads know their jobs.

'Malky has a good record and got Cardiff promoted. He is used to players who want to work hard and are organised. And that style suits our squad here, we work hard and we want to be organised.

'Gerry Francis is still here helping me - there's no excuses for us not to perform.

'The tricky part is the transfers. We have meetings all the time, we need to look at what we need. If we can come up with some names for the new manager for when he comes out.'

The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC.

In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete.

The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise.

Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC.

Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter.

Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others.

Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.
