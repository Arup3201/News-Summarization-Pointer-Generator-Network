Jailed: David Simmonds, the son of a company director, admitted battering graduate Jia Ashton to death

A 6ft 2in man battered a petite business analyst to death as she walked home from work and then calmly ordered fish and chips.

Sentencing 19-stone David Simmonds to 28 years in jail for the murder of six-stone Jia Ashton, a judge asked the hushed courtroom: ‘Can you imagine a more unequal contest?’

He said the economics graduate’s final moments as she walked along a woodland path known as the Yellow Brick Road must have been ones of ‘abject terror’.

The injuries she suffered were so horrific that a pathologist compared them to those suffered in a car accident or a fall from a tall building.

Following the brutal killing, tattooed Simmonds then buried her body under logs and rocks before leaving to calmly order a fish and chip dinner from his local shop.

The former Thorntons worker even pretended to friends at the shop that the scratches on his arms and face were caused after he got into a pub brawl to ‘protect a girl’.

Mrs Ashton’s body was found three days later by a mountain rescue dog following an intensive search of the local area.

The 25-year-old, who had been to see a doctor to discuss starting a family shortly before her death, was described in court as ‘conscientious, determined and focused’ with ‘every prospect of a successful career’.

In contrast, Simmonds was staying at the homes of various friends after a fall-out with his parents, and had taken out a £30 crisis loan from his local Jobcentre Plus on the day he killed the young woman.

Nottingham Crown Court heard Simmonds, 21, claimed to have ‘panicked’ while attempting to rob Mrs Ashton, possibly after she fought back or recognised him.

The pair lived in the same area and Simmonds had been employed at Thorntons as a seasonal Christmas worker twice in the past.

But Judge Michael Stokes QC said her horrific injuries, including a ruptured heart, suggested a ‘sinister motive’ and ‘dangerous hidden aspects’ to the 21-year-old.

The hearing was also told that police 
had suspected a sexual motive for the attack, but there was no forensic 
evidence to back the claim.

Judge Stokes added that Simmonds had robbed Mrs Ashton and her husband 
Matthew, 26, of a ‘golden future’ together in a ‘most cruel and wicked 
manner’.

Jailing Simmonds for life, with a recommendation he serve at least 28 
years before being considered for release, he added: ‘You have pleaded 
guilty very late in the day to a truly terrible crime that has left 
Jia’s husband and family utterly devastated.

‘You have visited immense shock on your own family. They can simply not imagine what you have done.

‘Had your motive been only robbery, given the huge disparity in size and
weight, you would have had a simple task of relieving her of the few 
pounds she had in her possession.

‘I am satisfied that, whatever the motive, you intended to kill her.’

Detectives leading the investigation said the attack on Mrs Ashton, who was on her way home along a woodland path known as the Yellow Brick Road, was a chance attack and Simmonds did his best to conceal the murder.

He covered her body with twigs and branches and scattered her belongings around Sleetmoor Woods immediately after the murder.

Mrs Ashton, who graduated from Warwick University with an economics degree, was eventually found by a mountain search and rescue dog on March 13, three days after she vanished.

Simmonds has refused to offer any explanation for the attack, although police say there may have been a ‘sexual element’ to the fatal assault.

While
Mrs Ashton had not been sexually assaulted, her clothing had been 
pulled up, exposing her abdomen, where ‘contact’ DNA was recovered.

Her
purse was also empty, suggesting robbery as a possible motive for the 
attack

Following
Simmonds’s guilty plea, it can be revealed that he had temporary jobs 
at Thorntons over the last two Christmas periods, though police do not 
believe he met Mrs Ashton or her music teacher husband.

Mrs Ashton suffered severe injuries and broken ribs and died of a 
compression to the chest, which caused her heart to fatally rupture.

Her shoulder bag was found 15ft up in the branches of a tree. Five 
buttons from her coat were also scattered nearby. Also discarded in the 
woods were her glasses, MP3 player and damaged mobile phone.

Tragically, Mrs Ashton had rowed with her husband in the days leading up
to her death, causing to him to briefly move out of the home they shared
in Somercotes, Derbyshire, close to the Thorntons headquarters where 
she worked.

In a heart-rending twist, she left a conciliatory voicemail message for 
Matthew, saying they should ‘do something nice’ that evening - but he 
didn’t listen to it until the next day, after she had been killed.

Mr Ashton, a junior school teacher and private piano tutor, had been an 
early suspect in the murder after he had been filmed on CCTV booking 
into a local Travel Lodge around the time his wife disappeared.

He told police he spent a night at the hotel after a fall-out with his 
wife. But the row had ‘not been serious’ and he said he had just needed 
to ‘give Jia some space’.

When he returned home from work the following evening, on March 10 this 
year, he discovered the house was empty and reported her missing.

The 26-year-old was arrested and quizzed by police before being eventually cleared of any involvement in her death.

Shortly after ruling him out, detectives became convinced the killer was
a local after receiving several witness reports of a scruffy man acting
suspiciously in the 50-acre Sleetmoor Woods around the time she was 
attacked.

From the descriptions, police decided there was a strong possibility the
wanted man was a vagrant and obtained from the local council a list of 
the registered homeless.

It included Simmonds, whose fingerprints and DNA matched that found on her belongings recovered from the scene.

It was a vital breakthrough as Simmonds, who had no previous convictions, was not on the police’s national DNA database. 

Simmonds initially pleaded not guilty to Mrs Ashton’s murder and was due
to go on trial on November 1. But he changed his plea at Nottingham 
Crown Court last week.

Following that hearing, Mr Ashton released a statement ‘for the family 
of Jia Ashton’ in which he said: ‘I hope that justice will be done and 
that this despicable being will never be free to kill again.’
