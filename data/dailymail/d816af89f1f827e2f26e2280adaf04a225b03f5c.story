A company boss who took 800 workers on a dream trip to Disney World in Florida is facing a £2.5million bill – because the  taxman ruled it was a perk.

Malcolm Walker treated managers from Iceland supermarkets across Britain to a five-day company conference at the home of Mickey Mouse.

But HM Revenue and Customs officials say the trip was a ‘benefit in kind’ for the staff and are demanding that Iceland pays £2.5million in tax.

Wish you were here? Iceland staff enjoy a day out at Disneyworld in Florida during a 'conference' paid for by the company which HMRC now claims must be taxed to the tune of £2.5million

Mr Walker is furious and refusing to 
pay up, arguing: ‘We did it because it’s an investment. Disney is the 
No 1 in the world for customer service. We’re exposing our staff to 
world-class customer service, and if just 10 per cent of it transfers 
back home, it will be worth every penny.

‘It was fun and I’m not apologising  for that. Having fun has been a key factor in driving what we’ve achieved  at Iceland.’

Mr Walker, 66, flew his team of 
managers to Florida for a £4million conference, including shows and 
day-trips to the Disney resorts, in 2009. But four years later the 
taxman insists the trip was little more than a free holiday for his 
workers.

Mr Walker, who set up Iceland in 
Deeside, North Wales, argued that the £5,000-a-head theme park tour was a
business expense designed to give his senior staff an insight into the 
heights of customer service at Disney World. But HMRC officials say the 
trip was actually a reward for staff, and therefore a taxable benefit.

Mr Walker added: ‘At Iceland, our 
biggest single strategic decision has been to focus on looking after our
colleagues, ensuring that they are happy and motivated. The logic is 
that they, in turn, will look after our customers well and that will 
drive sales and profits.

‘At Iceland, we believe in fun. We 
must be doing something right because we were named by The Sunday Times 
as the Best Big Company to Work For in the UK.’

Iceland has 776 stores employing 
23,000 staff across Britain – taking on the big supermarkets such as 
Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda.

Benefits in kind are goods and services provided to an employee for free or at greatly reduced costs.

They are sometimes called 'perks' or 'fringe benefits' and can include company cars, private medical insurance paid for by the employer or free loans.

Some will be taxed only for people who are not in lower paid employment, while others are applicable to everyone.

The tax is based on the cash equivalent value of the benefit.

Mr Walker – who says Iceland has paid 
£513million in tax over the past eight years – added: ‘We have invested 
millions over the past seven years in giving our store managers and head
office staff the best conferences money can buy.

‘These are unique, mind-blowing events that bring them back to the business buzzing and hungry for more success.

‘You might think that the Government 
would be keen to learn from this success. Instead, they seem determined 
to do their utmost to snuff out the fun in business by taxing as a 
benefit any  kind of corporate event that might be considered 
enjoyable.’

HMRC refuses to discuss individual tax affairs, but offers advice to companies on staff outings.

It says overseas trips ‘variously 
described as conferences, conventions or seminars are often no more than
incentives intended to reward past performance or to motivate employees
for the future’.

On its website, HMRC warns that tax 
collectors will look out for trips where ‘the itinerary will consist 
largely of social occasions, excursions and leisure activities’.

It adds: ‘No deduction should  be permitted for the cost of  such trips.’
