They have a bad reputation for watered-down cocktails, limited dining options and enforced merriment at the post-buffet disco. Not to mention a clientele with a tendency to not wander beyond the confinements of the hotel grounds and actually explore a little of the country they are visiting.

But there are some all-inclusive resorts that put those types to shame. Yes, everything is included but guests can expect high-quality alcohol, fine dining with a decent range of restaurants, and non-cheesy entertainment.

These are the best all-inclusive resorts around the world, as awarded in the TripAdvisor Travelers Awards 2014, which are based on millions of reviews by travelers worldwide.
