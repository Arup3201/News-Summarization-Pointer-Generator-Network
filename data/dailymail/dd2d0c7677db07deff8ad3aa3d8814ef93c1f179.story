Michael Phelps has been handed a six-month suspension by USA Swimming following his arrest for allegedly drink driving last month.

The most successful Olympic athlete in history, with 22 medals in total including 18 golds, announced on Sunday his plan to take a break for an unspecified amount of time to focus on his personal issues in the wake of the scandal.

Yet his governing body has taken a dim view of the incident and released a statement on its official website detailing the punishment for the 29-year-old, who cannot take part in official events sanctioned by USA Swimming until April 6 next year.

Phelps also has to withdraw from the 2015 FINA World Championships team and will have his funding withdrawn for the length of his ban.

'Membership in USA Swimming, and particularly at the national team level, includes a clear obligation to adhere to our code of conduct,' USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus said.

'Should an infraction occur, it is our responsibility to take appropriate action based on the individual case. Michael's conduct was serious and required significant consequences 

Phelps confirmed he would be taking a break from swimming through a series of tweets on Sunday

29-year-old (pictured partying hard during a 2008 Bahamas vacation) was unable to perform standard field sobriety tests, though he remained 'cooperative throughout' the encounter with police they said

'Michael has publicly acknowledged the impact of his decisions, his accountability especially due to his stature in the sport and the steps necessary for self-improvement.

'We endorse and are here to fully support his personal development actions.'

Phelps was arrested and charged in Baltimore, Maryland nearly 10 years after his first infraction for the same offence. 

Phelps is the most decorated Olympian in sports history, winning 18 Olympic golds during his career

On Sunday, he announced on his official Facebook and Twitter pages his plans to take a break, saying: 'I recognise that this is not my first lapse in judgement, and I am extremely disappointed with myself. I'm going to take some time away to attend a program that will provide the help I need to better understand myself.'

Phelps first came to prominence after winning six golds at the 2004 Olympics in Athens before setting a record for the number of gold medals at a Games by topping the podium eight times in Beijing four years later.

Four more golds at London 2012 followed and although he announced his intentions to never compete again, he returned to the pool earlier this year and had been seeking to add to his medal haul at the Rio Games in 2016.
