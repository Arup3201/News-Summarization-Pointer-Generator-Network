The day was probably going swimmingly for this fish – then he got the fright of his life.

As the blue humphead wrasse was distracted by a diver taking photos, another sneaked up behind him, resulting in this snap in which the fish looks as though it’s jumped out of its skin.

Hendric Carlstrvm, who is doing the eyeballing, was on his first scuba dive in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia.

But luckily, curiosity got the better of the blue Humphead Maori Wrasse and the frightened fish soon returned to investigate Swedish born Henric and his strange device once again, making for some great photo opportunities.

Henric said: 'Myself and my girlfriend had no idea we would get such a brilliant photo when we went diving that day.

'It was my first ever scuba dive and I couldn’t wait to see the amazing sea life, I was fascinated as soon as I saw the fish so headed towards it.

'But it didn’t seem to notice me as it was very interested in the camera so I swam over slowly expecting it to notice me, these type of fish are very friendly with divers so I wasn’t nervous about approaching it.

'As I got really close, I thought I would swim alongside it, which was when the picture was taken.'

After appearing to be frightened off, the fish turned back to investigate Mr Carlstrvm and his diving gear

Mr Carlstrvm said the fish was very interested in his camera, which meant he was able to capture the images
