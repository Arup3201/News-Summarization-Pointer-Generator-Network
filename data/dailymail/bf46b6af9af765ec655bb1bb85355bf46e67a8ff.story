One of Britain’s top barristers will tomorrow demand the release of court papers from the trial of Stephen Ward, the high-society fixer at the centre of the Profumo sex scandal, claiming there has been a cover-up.

Geoffrey Robertson QC will publicly criticise the National Archives for what he claims is its refusal to release the transcripts of the trial which took place 50 years ago.

Such transcripts are routinely made available to the public and Mr Robertson last night said he was not aware of another case where relevant papers had not been disclosed.

He said: ‘The Ward trial is the only trial in British legal history in which papers are being withheld.

'This is the most idiotic secrecy which has meant that the cover-up in relation to Stephen Ward continues to this day.’

Mr Robertson added: ‘They have refused me access on an entirely bogus claim that the disclosure of the documents would contrary to the Data Protection Act.

Once a trial is heard in open court, the open justice principle requires transcripts relating to that trial to be public.’

Mr Robertson has carried out his own review of the Ward trial after a lifetime’s fascination with the case.

Tomorrow he will publish his findings in a 190-page report which is expected to cast serious doubt on Ward’s 1963 conviction for living off immoral earnings.

It could lead to renewed pressure that the conviction should  be overturned.

The Profumo scandal was sparked by the
 revelation that War Minister John Profumo had an affair with Christine 
Keeler, a showgirl who was also in a relationship with a Russian naval 
attache. Ward, a successful osteopath and society portrait painter, had 
introduced the pair at a party in 1961.

Ward
 was subsequently charged with living off the immoral earnings of Keeler
 and her friend Mandy Rice-Davies, and with a separate charge of 
procuring prostitutes.

He
 took a fatal overdose before his trial at the Old Bailey ended and was 
still in a coma when he was found guilty of the first charge but cleared
 of the second. He died three days later on August 3, 1963.

Tony Blair wanted to give a knighthood to John Profumo but his plan was blocked by civil servants.

Mr Blair believed that Profumo – forced to quit as Minister of War in 1963 over his scandalous affair with Christine Keeler – deserved the honour because he worked tirelessly to restore his public reputation.

Documents obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws show that Mr Blair was considering a knighthood for the former Tory MP in the New Year’s Honours List of 2000 in recognition of Profumo’s work for charity, including the Toynbee Hall homeless project in London.

But the documents also show that civil servants were adamant that Profumo did not deserve the award. One official wrote: ‘Toynbee Hall is not the most active or stimulating organisation. As a training provider it is very poor . . . we do not support a further honour.’

Profumo, who had already been awarded a CBE in 1975, died in 2006 aged 91.

The decision to prosecute Ward, who is the subject of a new musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber, remains highly contentious.

Sources close to Mr Robertson’s investigation – first revealed by this newspaper in September – say it will argue that either the conviction should be quashed or that Ward should be granted a Royal pardon.

Mr Robertson declined to reveal his full conclusions, but added: ‘I do  analyse certain issues including whether the women were prostitutes at all, whether Ward lived off them or whether they, in fact, lived off him, and whether the judge behaved correctly in allowing the jury to convict on the evidence that was presented.’

A spokeswoman for the National Archives said none of the six files relating to the Ward case was described as a ‘transcript’.

But she confirmed that one file which contained allegations of  prostitution and details of the sex lives of named individuals was  closed until 2046.
