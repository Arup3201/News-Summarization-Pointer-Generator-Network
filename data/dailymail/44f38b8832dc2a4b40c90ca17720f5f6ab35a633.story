Penn State has been forced to surrender $60million in fines, serve a four-year ban on appearing in bowl games and must surrender all wins between 1998 and 2011 following months of turmoil resulting from the appalling Jerry Sandusky child sex scandal.

The punishments against the football team by the NCAA stunned the PSU campus, where students could be seen in shock while watching the announcement on TV.

The NCAA's actions also 
include a five-year probation and a reduction of scholarships for the 
next four, NCAA president Mark Emmert announced during a press 
conference in Indianapolis.

Before and after: Workers gutted the location of the Joe Paterno statue outside Beaver Stadium on Sunday morning, the day before the NCAA sanctions were announced

Guilty: Penn State's storied football programme is now marred by decades of sexual abuse by former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who was convicted last month

Ed Ray, the chairman of the NCAA executive committee, called the Penn State scandal a 'stern wake up call for everyone involved in college sports.'

The university’s storied football programme is now marred by decades of Sandusky's sexual abuse of young boys, some of which had occurred in Penn State facilities the like locker room showers.

The NCAA said the $60million figure is equivalent
to the annual gross revenue of the football program.

The money must be 
paid into an endowment for external programs preventing child sexual 
abuse or assisting victims and may not be used to fund such programs at 
Penn State.

Sadness: Some of those gathered to watch the NCAA announcement were stunned as the sanctions against Penn State were revealed

Response: Penn State students and others react as the NCAA sanctions were announced

'Football will never again be placed ahead of educating, nurturing and protecting young people,' Mr Emmert said.

He
added: 'All involved in intercollegiate athletics must be watchful that
programs and individuals do not overwhelm the values of higher 
education. 

'In the Penn State case, the results were perverse and 
unconscionable.'

Penn State will also be forced to give up 20 scholarships each year for four years.

Earlier in the press conference, Mr Emmert said he had 'never seen anything as egregious' as the horrific crimes of Sandusky and the efforts of head coach Joe Paterno and others at the university - including former Penn State President Graham Spanier and athletic director Tim Curley - to hide it.

Paterno's role in covering up the scandal was detailed in the report of former FBI director Louis Freeh, which was released this month.

The NCAA decided 
not to invoke its so-called 'death penalty,' a ban on competing in a 
sport - a move it has made five times before.

In surrendering all wins from 1998-2011, the NCAA undid 111 victories of Joe Paterno - who coached the team for nearly 50 years.

Once the winningest coach in NCAA Division I history, Paterno will now be No. 5 on the list.

Former Florida State coach Bobby 
Bowden will now hold the top spot in the NCAA Division I record book 
with 377 wins. Paterno will now be credited with 298 wins.

In a statement released on Monday afternoon, the Paterno family said: 'The NCAA has become the latest party to accept the [Freeh] report as the final word on the Sandusky scandal.

'The sanctions announced by the NCAA today defame the legacy and contributions of a great coach and educator without any input from our family or those who knew him best.'

The scholarship reductions mean that Penn State's roster will be capped at 65 scholarship players within a couple of seasons.

On edge: The potential for a historic NCAA penalty also is worrisome for a region where the economy is built at least partially on the strength and popularity of the football program

The normal scholarship limit for major college football programs is 85.

Emmert said that Penn State signed a consent decree, accepting the NCAA's punishment and agreeing not to appeal its decision.

Not long after the NCAA announcement, the Big Ten Conference - to which Penn State belongs - declared its own punishment against the school.

The conference announced that the university will not be allowed to share in the $13million bowl revenue during its postseason ban. Instead, the Big Ten will donate the funds to charity.

Staying or going? Current Penn State football players, pictured on Monday at the university, have been given the option to transfer to other schools

Kayla Weaver, a Penn State senior and 
member of the dance team called the Lionettes, said an NCAA death 
penalty would not only make football players transfer, but it also would
force program changes for cheerleaders, dancers and band members, and 
would hurt season-ticket holders.

'It could ruin everything that we've built here,' said Weaver, from Franklin Lakes, New Jersey.

Added Derek Leonard, a 31-year-old university construction project coordinator who grew up in the area: 'It's going to kill our town.'

Sandusky was convicted last month of using his high-profile position with Penn State football to rape and molest young boys and is currently awaiting sentencing.

He faces up to 500 years in prison.

Removal: The Paterno statue was surrounded by a fence and a tarp before it was taken down by construction workers on Sunday

Team in turmoil: The punitive measures against Penn State will likely impact the team severely in the years ahead

Under Paterno, the team was built into a national power under the slogan of 'success with honour.'

But that honour ended with disgrace for Paterno, who was fired in November after nearly 50 years of coaching.

He died of lung cancer in January.

As part of the NCAA sanctions against the Penn State football program, the university is forced to give up each of the victories it earned between 1998-2011.

For former head coach Joe Paterno, who was fired in November and died in January, 111 of his wins have now been undone.

That drops Paterno's win total down to 298, dropping him down from No. 1 to No. 5 on the list of winningest Division I Football Bowl Subdivision coaches.

Retired Florida State coach Bobby Bowden now takes Paterno's place.

Yesterday, the university tore down a statue of Paterno that stood outside Beaver Stadium.

Yesterday,
workers lifted a massive statue of Paterno off its base and used
a forklift to move it into Beaver Stadium early on Sunday morning.

As the statue was removed, 100 to 150 students who had gathered around chanted: 'We are Penn State.'

The university announced that it was going to take down the monument in the wake of an investigative report that found the late coach and three other top Penn State administrators concealed sex abuse claims against retired assistant coach Jerry Sandusky.

Paterno coached the team for 46 years before he was fired last year at the height of the Sandusky case.

The statue turned into a target for Paterno’s critics after former FBI Director Louis Freeh alleged a cover-up by Paterno and others that allowed Sandusky to continue molesting boys.

Police and construction workers barricaded both sides of the street and the sidewalks near the statue.

In a statement on Sunday morning, the Paterno reacted to the removal of the statue, saying: 'Tearing down the statue of Joe Paterno does not serve the victims of Jerry Sandusky's horrible crimes or help heal the Penn State Community. We believe the only way to help the victims is to uncover the full truth.'

Gone: The site outside Beaver Stadium where Joe Paterno's statue once stood has been stripped of all monuments after workers uprooted the statue honouring the late coach

Reaction: Some students and State College residents could not contain their emotions as they saw Beaver Stadium without the statue

The family also chided the media for what they called one-sided reporting on a document that Paterno is unable to defend himself against.

'The Freeh report, though it has been accepted by the media as the definitive conclusion on the Sandusky scandal, is the equivalent of an indictment - a charging document written by a prosecutor - and an incomplete and unofficial one at that.'

Penn State President Rod Erickson said Paterno's name will remain on the campus library because it 'symbolizes the substantial and lasting contributions to the academic life and educational excellence that the Paterno family has made to Penn State University.'

Farewell: Workers are seen carting away the covered statue of ex-Penn State football coach Joe Paterno on Sunday morning

Bill O'Brien, who was hired to replace Paterno, now faces the task of building the team with severe limitations, and trying to keep current players from fleeing to other schools, which the NCAA says they are free to do.

Star players such as tailback Silas Redd and linebacker Gerald Hodges are now essentially free agents.

O'Brien said: 'I knew when I accepted the position that there would be tough times ahead. But I am committed for the long term to Penn State and our student athletes.'

Last week, the group that runs the parking area dubbed 'Paternoville,' where students camp out for tickets before games, stripped that title and changed the name to 'Nittanyville.'

Down and out: Penn State President Rod Erickson said he decided to have the statue removed and put into storage because it 'has become a source of division and an obstacle to healing'

Removing all traces: Since a scathing report that detailed how much Paterno knew about the child sex scandal, his name is being pulled from much of the school
