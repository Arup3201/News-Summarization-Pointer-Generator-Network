Liverpool owner John Henry has responded to fans over their protest over ticket prices – but supporters have said they will continue to protest until a meeting with the club is organised.

Liverpool supporters union The Spirit of Shankly and fans group Spion Kop 1906 wrote an open letter to the owner saying they will stop flying their protest flags when the club arrange a meeting to discuss the high ticket prices.

Jay McKenna, Spirit of Shankly chairman, told the Liverpool ECHO: ‘John Henry has replied saying the club will be in contact. As yet we haven’t had confirmation of a meeting.

‘As far as we’re concerned until they contact us and tell us there’s a meeting we continue as we are doing.

‘This weekend and December 9 we’re still objecting and will do so until they make contact.’

Fans held a protest during Saturday’s win over Stoke where they replaced their traditional flags and banners with protest ones over the rising ticket prices.

Flags pointed out that the price of tickets increased from £4 in 1990 to £24 in 2000, then to £43 in 2010. A fourth flag had the year 2020 on with a question mark indicating fans’ fears over what prices could rise to. 

A huge banner was also emblazoned with the words ‘Let me tell you a story of a poor boy”, the first line of the Reds’ anthem Scouser Tommy.

This season the most expensive single match adult ticket at Anfield now costs £59, while the cheapest is £37. 

Liverpool owner John Henry has made contact with the groups - but no meeting has been arranged yet

The open letter to Mr Henry read: ‘This isn’t merely a withdrawal of our ‘support’. It’s because we support the team and this football club so much that we persist in protesting. No, this is something much bigger. It is a warning of what is to come.’

Fans fear they will continue to be priced out of the game by the rising prices and want to discuss this with the club before it goes too far.
