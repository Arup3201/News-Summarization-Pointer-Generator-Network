Most teens have a little dabble with alcohol here and there - a cheeky swig of dad's beer or even a house party gone wrong - but that's all part and parcel of adolescence.

And Liz Badcock was no different. At 13 she began to get interested in the effects of booze but sadly, that interest turned toxic when she left home.

Her life turned into a bottomless pit of drink and drugs until, at her lowest, Liz, now 40, was downing two litres of vodka a day and throwing back 2-300 mg of Valium.

Liz Badcock tells how a life of drink and drugs was finally brought to heel when she discovered - by sheer chance - she was pregnant

Telling her story on This Morning, Liz, from Melksham, Wiltshire, explained: 'At 13 I sratred drinking. It was around, in the house.

'School friends would drink when their parents weren't in, that kind of thing.

'But when I left home it tipped over. I realised it [alcohol] made me feel different.

'I was happy and confident, which I wasn't normally and I loved that - and everyone always told me I was the life and soul.'

Happy times: Liz Badcock, right, with her husband Phil left. The couple worked together to help Liz overcome her addiction to drugs and booze and were thrilled to discover she was pregnant with their son, Harry

By 20, she was living in a flat-share and partying so hard she became reliant on alcohol, drinking lager for breakfast.

At 23, Liz was was prescribed diazepam for panic attacks, and didn't confess to the GP at the time that she drank as much as she did.

She then quickly became addicted to the pills too. Despite working as a PA, she drank throughout the day and Liz admits that the wild highs and lows of a life dependent on alcohol and prescription drugs left her suicidal.

Liz Badcock tells her story of drink and drug addiction on This Morning. The 40-year-old hit rock bottom when she discovered she would never have kids - but that wasn't actually to be

She tried to cut her wrists and take overdoses but was always found in time.

Life took a slight turn for the better when at 26 she met Phil, an IT manager at work. The pair quickly moved in together and it wasn't long before Phil realised how serious Liz's addictions were.

'I drank at work, drank first thing in the morning, took diazapam and basically abused it because it got rid of my hangovers.' says Liz.

Phil explains: 'We moved into my house together and after a few weeks I noticed she was drinking lots of bottles.'

'I was very clever at hiding it,' adds Liz. 'There were so many lies and I used to hide bottles in the middle of a bean bag as you couldn't hear them clink.

'I remember feeling rock bottom when I had a fall down the stairs - by then I was drinking two litres of vodka a day and taking 2-300 mgs of valium.'

After the pair married in 2003 Liz promised to cut back on her drinking but it didn't last long.

In fact she was soon running up huge bills by secretly buying pills online - there was only one thing Liz wanted more than pills and drink and that was a child.

She suffered from endometriosis, a severe and painful womb condition, and had never been able to become pregnant. She and Phil had failed attempts at IVF and Liz was told she would probably never be a mother.

That was to be the tipping point for Liz - she began drinking so heavily that she lost her job and Phil convinced her to go into rehab. It was there that she discovered her liver was in a dangerous state.

'I was basically killing myself with alcohol. I was in rehab for four weeks. They wanted me to stay longer but I insisted I wouldn’t relapse if I went home. Three weeks later, I was drinking and taking pills again.' Liz told Paula Greenspan in an interview with The Mirror.

But there would be an amazing peice of news that would finally help turn Liz's life around for good - the news she had always longed to hear- that she was in fact going to be a mother.

On a visit to her GP in 2011 she was asked to do a pregnancy test. She did not think for a second it would be positive but when it was she was overjoyed.

When I was told there was a life growing inside of me it made me reevaluate my whole life,' she explains.

'I was very concerned about what damage might have been done to my baby and I knew I had to give up everything.'

Phil adds: 'There was a lot of joy but a lot of concern but Liz stopped drinking.'

In June 2012 Liz gave birth to couple's son Harry and Liz has now turned her life around.

'I now feel like the richest person in the world and being a mum is the best drug I could ever have.'
