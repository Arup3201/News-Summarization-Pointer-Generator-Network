Syrian government forces yesterday launched an attack on the country’s largest city in what Britain and the U.S. warned may become a massacre.

Artillery fire and an air bombardment pounded rebel-held areas of Aleppo to prepare the ground for a full onslaught.

The rebels have been gradually seizing parts of Syria’s most strategically-important city, and for the past week fighting fierce  battles with President Bashar al-Assad’s forces.

But the pro-government al-Watan 
newspaper warned that the ‘mother of all battles’ was about to start as 
Assad’s regime tries to recapture all of the city.

The battle for 
Aleppo, which is home to 2.5million, is being seen as a turning point in
the 16-month uprising against Assad in a conflict where both the rebels
and the government have struggled to gain the upper hand.

The US State Department said it had 
received credible reports of tank columns moving on Aleppo, along with 
air strikes by helicopter gunships. These represented a serious 
escalation of Assad’s efforts to crush his opponents.

‘This is the concern: that we will see
a massacre in Aleppo, and that’s what the regime appears to be lining 
up for,’ a spokesman said.

British Foreign Secretary William Hague 
warned: ‘This utterly unacceptable escalation of the conflict could lead
to a devastating loss of civilian life and a humanitarian disaster.

‘All those with influence on the 
Syrian regime should bring it to bear now. No nation should stand silent
while people in Aleppo are threatened with a potential massacre.’

He said the looming battle showed why 
Russia and China were wrong to veto a UN Security Council resolution 
that would have imposed new sanctions backed with the threat of military
intervention.

As the remaining residents of Aleppo 
braced themselves for more bloodshed, General Robert Mood, the outgoing 
head of the UN monitoring mission, said Assad’s days were numbered.

‘It is only a matter of time before a 
regime that is using such heavy  military power and disproportional 
violence against the civilian population is going to fall,’ said the 
Norwegian general.

Rebels have detained at least 100 
Syrian soldiers, policemen and pro-government militiamen this week in 
Aleppo, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Some of the detainees’ faces were 
covered with bruises and showed signs of swelling around their eyes and 
when they spoke their voices quavered.

Yesterday government troops stationed 
on the outskirts of the city unleashed barrages of heavy-calibre mortar 
rounds on its western neighbourhoods, while Russian-built  MI-25 
helicopter gunships struck in the east.

The heavy fighting follows an 
audacious bomb attack that killed four of Assad’s closest lieutenants in
Damascus on July 18, a development that led some analysts to speculate 
that the government’s grip was slipping.

Majed al-Nour, an opposition activist,
said: ‘The rebels are present in the east and west of Aleppo, and have a
foothold in areas of the centre.

‘The regime forces control the 
entrances of Aleppo and the main thoroughfares and commercial streets 
and are bombarding the residential districts that fell into rebel 
hands.’ He added that tens of thousands of people had fled Aleppo to 
nearby northern rural regions close to Turkey.
