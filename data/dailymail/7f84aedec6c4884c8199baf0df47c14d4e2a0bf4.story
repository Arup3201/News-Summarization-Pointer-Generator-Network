Las Vegas residents fear voodoo rituals are to blame for piles of headless cockerels and pigeons that are being found on the city's streets.

Piles of birds, intact save for their heads, have been left in several locations in the past few weeks, but every time they are cleared away, more bodies appear.

West African priest Duane Reece has confirmed that the sightings could be linked to magic rituals, saying someone could be trying to use voodoo to appease a spirit.

Ritual: The appearance of headless roosters in the back alleys of Las Vegas has been blamed on voodoo rituals

The birds are mostly roosters and pigeons, and they appear in perfect condition except that their heads have been neatly lopped off.

Street cleaner Ryan Roskins started to see the headless chickens a few weeks back, and told KLAS-TV he has continued to see carcasses as he makes his rounds.

'The first time I saw it, it was a large rooster. Everything else is there, feet, feathers. It’s just decapitated,' he said. 'I actually think it must be voodoo.'

Reece, a priest for the African Ifa religion which has similarities to Voodoo, said the placing of the birds would suggest it is part of a ritual. 

'They might be wiping themselves with 
the bird, letting the blood and then having to discard the body,' Reece said.

He added that those who follow religions like Ifa often sacrifice birds and goats for protection or cleansing rituals.

The carcasses then have to be left in a place the 'deity is calling out for' he added.

Distrubing: The headless pigeons and other birds has upset store owners, who say they are a health risk

With voodoo, most birds or animals used for sacrifice are usually eaten afterwards in communal meals, and their blood is splashed over altars.

But for business owners in Vegas, having to constantly call animal control to have the dead birds removed has become a sickening chore.

The stench of rotting chicken lingers in the alleys behind their businesses, and the store owners are concerned about possible health risks.
