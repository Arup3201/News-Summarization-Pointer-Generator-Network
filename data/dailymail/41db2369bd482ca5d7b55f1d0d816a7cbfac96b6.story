Surrounded by screaming rioters 
and in the grip of a mob mentality, this was the moment a mother and 
daughter were caught on camera preparing to take part looting which left
a shopkeeper with just 25p to his name.

Clarice
Ali, 38, was filmed gesturing obscenely at a television camera seconds 
before she and her 20-year-old daughter Chantelle Dixon-Ali stormed a 
convenience store which was ripped apart in a single night of violence 
during the London riots.

In what 
became one of the enduring images of the looting, grocer Siva Kandiah 
was pictured in tears with only 25p left in his pocket after rioters 
plundered his convenience store in Hackney, East London before setting 
it ablaze on August 8.

their part in the looting

Clarice
Ali was one of the raiders captured on CCTV breaking into Clarence 
Convenience store, while her daughter Dixon-Ali could also be seen 
emptying the shelves.

The 
20-year-old kept her face 
covered throughout the raid in a vain attempt to avoid detection.

But
the shameless pair were caught after her mother pulled down her scarf 
to swear at the camera as a masked mob of other suspected looters 
swarmed around the store.

The defiant gesture cost the mother and daughter team their liberty when they were jailed for violent disorder and burglary.

The pair stood in the dock together as they were put behind bars at Wood Green Crown Court.

Ali was jailed for two years while her daughter will be locked up in a young offenders' institution for 28 months.

Looted: Ali and her daughter ransacked this shop in Hackney

Victim: Shiva Kandiah is pleased that justice has been done after his shop was torn apart in the rioting

Dixon-Ali and her mother, who live together in Dalston, were each charged with violent disorder and burglary on October 21.

Ali admitted violent disorder, but denied the burglary charge, which was then dropped. Dixon-Ali admitted both charges.

Shopkeeper
Siva Kandiah, who has renamed his store Siva's Shop, was devastated 
when savage looters stole his entire stock and even took some of the 
building's fittings and fixtures.

But Mr Kandiah said today: 'I feel like justice has been done.'

Detective Inspector Phil Langworthy, of Hackney Police's riot investigation unit, said he was pleased with the sentences.

He warned: 'If you were involved in the disorder, then I encourage you to come forward before we come to you.'

Siva Kandiah fled his home in 
Tamil-controlled northern Sri Lanka in 1996 to escape a bloody civil war.

Believing Britain was a country 
where he could be safe and would be allowed to run a business, it was 
this country he chose to build a new life for himself.

He started out as a newsagent and 
slowly expanded his business into a convenience shop, saying he 
considered it an 'honour' to serve his new community.

But in a cruel twist of irony, some of his customers were among the yobs who targeted his shop.

The 39-year-old former refugee was horrified when he saw live news footage of his shop being attacked during the riots.

He had boarded up the shop and gone 
home to protect his wife and two daughters, aged six and two, after 
gangs began to prowl through Hackney the day after the first outbreak of
violence in Tottenham.

The former refuge was stunned to find that looters had smashed anything they could not steal including a bank cash machine.

They took everything including 
fixtures and fittings and shelving before setting the store ablaze, 
leaving the devastated businessman with a £50,000 repair bill.

But loyal customers rallied around 
and launched the ‘Friends of Siva’ appeal fund, which raised more than 
£30,000 to help Siva Kandiah return to business.

His store in Hackney - now officially named Siva’s Shop - re-opened just one week after the riots.
