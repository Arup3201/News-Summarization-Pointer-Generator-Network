Chilling photographs reveal the arsenal of deadly weapons recovered from the car of two men accused of plotting to murder soul singer Joss Stone.

Police officers found a Samurai sword, knives, a metal spike chisel and hammers in the battered Fiat Punto of Junior Bradshaw, 32, and Kevin Liverpool, 35.

The photographs, released today by detectives in Devon and Cornwall, also show maps, bags, a length of hosepipe, black balaclavas and black gloves that were found in the vehicle.

Plot: The singer is seen leaving Exeter Crown Court after giving evidence in the trial earlier in the week

Police also released a photo of the red car the pair damaged when they crashed as they drove down from their home in Manchester to Devon. They are accused of making the journey in order to carry out their alleged plot.

Officers found the weapons when they arrested Liverpool and Bradshaw seven miles from the singer's isolated rural home at Ashill, Devon, in June 2011.

The trial has previously heard notes discovered by police referred to decapitating the singer and dumping her body in a river.

Further images reveal a crossbow and a BB gun found among a separate collection of weapons recovered from a cupboard at the ground floor flat the defendants shared in Longsight, Manchester.

The pictures of the key exhibits in the prosecution case were released as prosecutor Simon Morgan concluded the Crown's case against the pair.

The trial jury was told today that no physical evidence had been found from Bradshaw.

Evidence: A length of hosepipe found in the possession of the pair, who deny plotting to murder soul singer Joss Stone

A detective told the court that no fingerprints from Bradshaw had been found on any of the weapons or exhibits seized.

And Det Sgt Martin Sutcliffe - second in charge of the inquiry into the alleged plot to murder and rob the soul diva - told the jury that no text messages relevant to the allegations were sent or received by Bradshaw.

The officer also said the same was true of any telephone calls and that nothing could be found that could be attributed to Bradshaw in any diary or handwriting.

Det Sgt Sutcliffe also agreed under cross examination by Bradshaw's barrister Martin Meeke QC that there was 'no direct evidence that he had researched Joss Stone or printed maps'.

Mr Meeke told the jury that Bradshaw had been jailed eleven times in the past for breaching a signing on order telling police where he lived, after he was convicted of exposing himself on the steps of Leeds Town Hall in 2006.

The defence lawyer said Bradshaw had also appeared at the Old Bailey after sleeping rough in London, and that the court gave him a hospital order which saw him admitted to the Manchester Royal Infirmary's mental unit.

Prosecution: The photographs were released today as the Crown concluded its case against Bradshaw and Liverpool - their defence case will begin on Monday

Liverpool refused to give police any handwriting samples and the jury heard there were 77 matches out of 100 fingerprints found on exhibits.

'Disguise': A black balaclava mask found in the defendants' car

The court heard the crossbow and BB gun were found in their flat. Judge Francis Gilbert QC said the crossbow had no string and was 'not in working order'.

The jury was told Liverpool had previous convictions for assault and for having bladed articles, or knives, in public places.

Exeter Crown Court heard on one occasion in 2007 he had a knife in a holdall along with a ski mask and gloves which were found during a stop and search.

He was also given a community sentence in 2010 with a mental health requirement.

Ms Stone gave evidence earlier this week and told the jury that the first she knew about the alleged plot to murder her was when the police turned up at her home.

The Crown say the motive for the conspiracy may have been robbery. The court heard Liverpool owed Â£920 in court fines. Bradshaw had no outstanding fines.

Local postman Alex Greening told the court he saw two black men from Manchester in narrow country lanes near the singer's home, and claimed one of the man showed him a photo of the singer and asked where she lived.

Det Sgt Sutcliffe said yesterday no photo of the singer was recovered.

The Crown has completed its case and the defence will begin on Monday.

The two men deny conspiracy to murder, rob and cause grievous bodily harm with intent to the internationally acclaimed singer and songwriter.

The trial continues.
