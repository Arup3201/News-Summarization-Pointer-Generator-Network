Charities could be forced to declare their spending on campaigns amid fears they have become too political, it was revealed yesterday.

Under changes proposed by the regulator, charities would have to declare how much of their income comes from the Government, and their annual campaign spend.

The proposals follow concerns that some charities have used millions of pounds of public money to subsidise politically driven campaigns.

A recent study by the Institute of Economic Affairs found many well-known charities had used taxpayers’ cash to push for causes ‘which are not priorities for the electorate and are often unpopular’.

Oxfam was criticised for this campaign which was accused of being too political for spoke out against Government spending cuts 

Current rules allow charities to campaign provided they do not back individual political parties or candidates, but MPs have raised concerns that some recent campaigns have been politically driven.

The Charity Commission is considering a complaint from Conservative MP Conor Burns that Oxfam’s recent anti-poverty campaign was ‘overtly political’.

A mock film poster produced by the charity carried the slogan: ‘The perfect storm… starring zero hours contracts, high prices, benefits cuts, unemployment, childcare costs.’

The aid charity spent £18million on ‘campaigning and advocacy’ in the 2012-3 financial year – seven per cent of its annual expenditure, according to its most recent accounts. It received £34million in funding from the Government in the same period.

It denied the ‘perfect storm’ publicity was political and said it had a duty to highlight hardship in Britain.

Conservative MPs have also raised concerns over the alleged ‘politicisation of poverty’ surrounding food banks in Britain and have claimed that some charities have been used as vehicles for a pro-Labour agenda.

Child care charity the Family and Childcare Trust faced criticism after it posted a series of tweets with the hashtag #childcarecrisis, which has been used by the Labour Party.

The RSPCA was accused of politically motivated prosecutions of hunt supporters after it brought a £326,000 private prosecution against the Heythrop Hunt in David Cameron’s Oxfordshire constituency.

Donations to the charity dropped by more than £7million after it was criticised for spending donors’ money on controversial political issues including hunting, badger culls and horse racing pursuing.

The charity said its spending on prosecutions was separate to its campaigning budget. A spokesman said campaigning accounted for less than one per cent of the charity’s total budget in 2013.

It has hired a senior lawyer to review its prosecutions policy, following the Heythrop private prosecution.

Charities already publish annual reports showing income and expenditure, but the Charity Commission proposals would require greater breakdowns on spending on campaigns and income from Government.

The regulator said it had completed a consultation process and expected to reach a decision in October.

Its own research into public trust and confidence in the charity sector has found overall trust remains high but revealed a slight decrease in trust over charities’ independence.

Fewer people believed that ‘most charities are trustworthy and act in the public interest’ – 71 per cent in 2014 compared to 75 per cent in 2010 – and there was also a slight drop in the number of people who believed charities could be trusted to work independently.

A member of the commission’s board, Gwythian Prins, said the public’s perception of charity campaigns had changed.

He said last year: ‘The weather has changed. The public expects charities to stick to their knitting.

‘Problems arise when charities push the envelope. If a charity campaigns about matters that appear to be outside its objects, then we will look at it.’

But charities have warned the regulator’s proposals are an attempt to silence them and have called on the Charity Commission to abandon the proposed changes.

Sir Stephen Bubb, the head of the ACEVO group which represents charity leaders, said: ‘This is not just a question of free speech but also of fostering a culture of public decision-making based upon evidence and giving a voice to the voiceless in public debate.

‘What we say may make uncomfortable listening but those in government who close their ears ought to be ashamed.’

The Charity Finance Group, which represents finance officers in the sector, said the changes would lead to confusion and would place an ‘unnecessary burden’ on charities.

But Tories welcomed the proposed changes. Charlie Elphicke (corr), Conservative MP for Dover, said: ‘It’s right that charities should be transparent in terms of the money they get from the Government and how they spend it.

‘People want to know that charities walk the walk and really help people on the frontline, rather than just talk the talk.’
