Missing: Mami Konneh Lahun, who finished 20th in the London Marathon, disappeared after the race yesterday but was found today

A female athlete from Sierra Leone who was declared missing then supposedly found is in fact still missing, it has emerged.

Mami Konneh Lahun, 24, was reportedly discovered 'safe and well' in Greenwich 24 hours after disappearing from the finish line of the London Marathon.

But five hours later, Scotland Yard has revealed she is still missing and there has been no trace of her after she finished 20th in yesterday's race.

It is understood a police officer was involved in the error becoming public, although Scotland yard refused to say if that was the case.

A police spokesman said: 'We were given incorrect information, she is still missing.'

It is an embarrassment for Greenwich borough Commander Helen Millichap, whose officers were involved in the search.

Police put out an appeal last night after Miss Lahun failed to return to her temporary accommodation in Greenwich yesterday.

The athlete, who is Sierra Leone's fastest-ever 5,000 metre and 10,000 metre runner, last year won her country's marathon and in neighbouring Liberia.

She is the first woman from Sierra Leone to have represented the country at the London Marathon.

Scotland Yard said she arrived in Britain a week ago to prepare for the marathon, and finished in just over 2 hours 46 minutes.

Detectives looking into her disappearance revealed she had no known links to the UK and no money or mobile phone.

Earlier today, a Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'She has today been found safe and well, having returned to the address in Greenwich'.

It came after the London Olympics in 2012, where dozens of athletes and coaches disappeared or claimed asylum after the Games.

The Mail revealed that seventy claimed political asylum after the Olympics and more than have were given refugee status.

Last year police admitted they were still looking for 21 people who just vanished, with one official saying that some had competed then ‘simply wandered off to make a better life’ in Britain.

Those who failed to return home were from countries including the Ivory Coast, Guinea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Cameroon and Sudan.

Talented: Mami Konneh Lahun was part of the front pack in the elite women's race yesterday, finishing a creditable 20th in 2hrs 46mins

Among those believed to have claimed asylum were the Congolese judo coach Ibula Masengo, athletics director Guy Nkita and boxing trainer Blaise Bekwa.

The Eritrean athlete Weynay Ghebresilasie, 18, was one of four from his country to claim asylum before the Games finished. He said he was doing so because of ‘harsh conditions’ and ‘lack of basic human rights’ in Eritrea.

Anyone with information about the whereabouts of  Mami Konneh Lahun asked to call 101, quoting reference 14MIS012462.
