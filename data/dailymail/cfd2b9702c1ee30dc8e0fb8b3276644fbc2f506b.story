Theresa May announced the end of cheap alcohol today as she set out plans for new minimum prices which will add £2 to a supermarket 12-pack of beer or cider.

The Home Secretary said as a result of the reforms 'cheap vodka, super-strength cider and special brew lagers will go up in price' in a bid to tackle anti-social behaviour.

A minimum price of 40p per unit is likely to be brought in - hitting cut-price supermarket deals.

Other moves in the Government’s long-awaited alcohol strategy include:

Minimum pricing could spell the end for supermarket own brands as they lose their price advantage.

A
two-litre plastic bottle of cider, containing 15 units, can sell for as
little as £3. But under a minimum pricing scheme of 40p per unit, it 
could not be sold for less than £6.

Supermarket
own-brand whisky and vodka bottles containing 28 units can be found for
between £5 and £8. But this would rise to £11.20 under the minimum 
price plans.

12-can packs 
of Fosters and Strongbow are currently priced at £9 in the supermarkets,
but under the reforms they would rise to £11. Bulk buy promotions will also go - so an offer of two 12-pack boxes of beer for £16 would have to go up to at least £22.

Supermarkets will also not be able to offer three-for-two deals on wine.

Party's over: Supermarkets will be banned from offering buy-one-get-one-free deals on alcohol

End of cheap booze: Theresa May outlines new minimum prices for alcohol in the House of Commons today

Theresa May outlined the Government's plans today in a rare Friday statement in the House of Commons.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette 
Cooper accused the Government of rushing out the proposals to avoid further bad 
headlines over this week’s Budget.

She said Mrs May was being 
used as a 'human shield' in an effort to distract attention from the row
over the Budget’s 'granny tax' raid on pensioners.

Mrs May told MPs that by increasing the cheapest drinks in price, anti-social behaviour will be cut.

'Most people have no problem with alcohol, they enjoy a drink - indeed it’s one of life’s pleasures, she said.

'But we all know there is a significant minority in this country who drink dangerously and who cause disproportionate harm.'

Drunken violence had 'made many town centres no-go areas for law-abiding citizens'.

She told the Commons: 'In some shops 
and supermarkets, drinks are now so heavily discounted it is possible to
buy a can of lager for as little as 20p or a two-litre bottle of cider 
for just £1.69.

'That means many people now drink excessively at home and many "pre-load" before they go out.'

She said 'pre-loaders' were estimated to be two-and-a-half times more likely to be involved in violence than other drinkers.

Evidence showed alcohol consumption 
was closely linked to the price of drink and 'increasing the price of 
the very cheapest alcohol does most to reduce heavy drinking', with 
young people particularly affected by increases in cost.

The Government argue that a 40p minimum
price could mean 50,000 fewer crimes each year and 9,000 fewer 
alcohol-related deaths over the next decade.

The death of bargain bulk buy promotions will hit middle class families stocking up on supplies of beer and wine.

Supermarkets will not be able to offer three-for-two deals on wine. An offer of two 12-pack boxes of beer or cider for £16 would have to rise to at least £22 under the reforms.

The Government are targeting young drinkers who 'pre-load' on cheap booze before going out.

By increasing the price of drink bought in bulk, Ministers are confident they will cut consumption and change habits.

However, they will inadvertently hit middle-class occasional drinkers trying to get the best value for money at the checkouts.

The price of cheap two litre bottles of cider - currently just £3 could double under the reforms.

However, they have not ruled 
out setting a higher minimum price and are currently consulting on the 
issue.

The move will be welcomed by medical 
experts, but has faced opposition from some Conservative MPs, who say it
will penalise moderate drinkers and cost consumers as much as 
£700million a year.

Ministers have been warned it could also be ruled 
illegal under EU free trade laws.

Mrs May added that 24-hour drinking had only made the problem of drink in town and city centres worse.

She said: 'We were promised under Labour's Licensing Act 2003 a European-style cafe culture.

'Nothing
could be further from the truth in many of our town centres on a Friday
and Saturday night and it's law-abiding citizens who are actually 
suffering as a result of that.'

The
Government’s alcohol strategy, designed to reduce the estimated 
£21billion annual cost of irresponsible drinking, will mean a ‘zero 
tolerance’ approach to drunken behaviour in A&E departments.

It also proposes a late-night levy to
make pubs and clubs help pay for policing and powers to prevent alcohol
being served to drunks.

The ‘zero tolerance’ 
approach to alcohol in A&E departments will mean hospitals getting 
the right to instigate a review of licences of particular pubs and clubs
if they are getting large numbers of patients they suspect have been 
drinking there.

Police
will be encouraged to put officers in hospitals on Saturday nights and 
other key periods, funded through the late-night levy on pubs and clubs.

The plan says minimum prices will 
tackle so-called ‘pre-loading’, when people drink cheap alcohol at home 
before heading to a pub or nightclub.

She also suggested that action was possible to restrict deep bulk discounts on alcohol.

Critics of the proposal say it will penalise responsible drinkers, such as middle-class members of ‘wine clubs’ who take advantage of discounted deals on fine wines and champagne.

Education Secretary Michael Gove is thought to have been among Cabinet ministers against the move.

Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said last night it was not ‘a magic bullet’, but ‘with the industry, we’re making strong progress. They are announcing a commitment by 2015 to take one billion units of alcohol out of the UK market by reducing alcohol content in some drinks and promoting lower-alcohol products.’

Ms Cooper said ministerial appearances on a Friday were usually only the result of a national emergency.

However 'the only emergency' at the 
moment was 'the Prime Minister and the Chancellor have gone wobbly over 
the coverage of their Budget', she said.

She said: 'There is no precedent for 
handling a long-awaited consultation document on a Friday morning with 
no notice in this way.

'Over the last 10 years there have 
been only three government statements on a Friday: on the Iraq War, on 
swine flu and on Libya. All of them involving serious issues around 
national emergencies.

'What is the national emergency 
today? The only emergency is that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor 
have gone wobbly over the coverage of their Budget.

'Their Budget has gone wrong because 
pensioners are furious about the granny tax, because middle earners are 
shocked to discover they will be paying the higher rate and because 
everyone else is furious to discover they are bringing in a £10,000 tax 
break for the highest earners in the country including, we discover, 
half the Cabinet.

'This is not about a 40p minimum price, it is about their failings on the 40p tax.

'The Home Secretary is being used as a human shield for the Chancellor and the Prime Minister and she should have said no.'

Andrew Opie, of the British Retail Consortium, said minimum pricing was in effect a ‘tax on responsible drinkers’.

But Eric Appleby of Alcohol Concern said: ‘This is a victory for common sense. We cannot carry on with a situation where it’s cheaper to buy cans of lager than a can of Coke.’

And Andrew Langford of the British Liver Trust added: ‘We are delighted the Government has recognised the importance of minimum price and would urge them to increase the amount to 50p per unit so it has more impact.’

There were 1.1million hospital admissions in England relating to alcohol in 2009/10.
