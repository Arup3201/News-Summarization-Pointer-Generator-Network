Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis (pictured arriving at court today) has denied claims he asked BBC staff to edit out footage of him groping a teenage girl on Top Of The Pops

Dave Lee Travis admitted yesterday he has ‘fallen into temptation’ – but insisted he had never forced himself on a woman.

During his second day in the witness box, the former Radio 1 DJ appeared to confess to cheating on his wife of 42 years Marianne.

Travis was asked by his barrister Stephen Vullo if he had ‘on occasion fallen into temptation’. The 68-year-old replied: ‘I don’t like the fact this is being said. Well yes, of course I’ve fallen once or twice. Consensual, I may add.’ Travis added: ‘I don’t force myself on women ... I’m sorry, that’s just not me.’

The former BBC star had earlier been accused of pinching the bottom of the girl as he introduced a song by The Smurfs as the cameras rolled.

The woman’s friend later accused producers of editing out the incriminating footage.

But Travis, 68, today told Southwark Crown Court his career would have been killed 'stone dead' if he had asked for the footage - shot in the late 1970s - to be cut.

He said: 'That wouldn’t happen. I do not have the power you see here.

'I’m probably the lowest of the low as far as the production team and bosses are concerned. We were just the DJs to them. We couldn’t ask for anything. Anything.'

He was asked by his defence barrister, Stephen Vullo, who he would have to ask for the clip to be edited.

He said he would have to ask the top editors and producers at Top Of The Pops to edit out the sequence.

Travis told jurors: 'It is difficult for me to answer that, no such thing happened.

Travis told the court his career would have been killed 'stone dead' if he had asked for the footage - shot in the late 1970s - to be cut

'I would have to go to the man at the 
very top of the BBC, somebody like John Birt. It is such a ridiculous 
thing to ask, nobody would do that. It’s the BBC for goodness sake.'

Asked what the effect would be on his career, Travis said: 'It would have killed it stone dead.

'So
 many would have been involved in that, you just can’t play around with 
these people. You can’t mess with something like the BBC - its simply 
not done.'

He
 branded the allegation 'insane' and said he would never have groped 
anyone while the cameras were rolling and with the audience in full 
view.

Travis said: 'That is a completely insane claim, and it’s especially insane as I’ve seen the video.'

He rubbished claims he had groped a girl, adding: 'We are surrounded by the audience and cameras and people. That’s not good for my career.

'If I had been caught doing that in the Top Of The Pops studio I should have thought that the book would have been thrown at me and I would have been out of the BBC.'

He told jurors: 'I did not sexually attack, put my hands on these girls or anything like that at any time.'

Travis, who is on trial at London’s 
Southwark Crown Court accused of indecently assaulting 10 women and 
sexually assaulting another, denies all the offences against him.

When
 claims he molested a British Airways employee under the table and in 
front of company bosses at a work party were put to him, he retorted: 
'Am I allowed to laugh? Because I’m sorry, it’s a situation which did 
not happen.'

Travis said he took his job seriously and that, even though working in showbusiness was fun, 'it is a business nevertheless'

Travis, from Buckinghamshire, denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault, dating back to 1976 and the height of his career.

Appearing under his birth name David Griffin, the alleged offences occurred when he was working as a BBC DJ, as a broadcaster with Classic Gold radio, while appearing on Top Of The Pops and when starring in panto.

Travis, who chose to sit down to give his evidence, said he took his job seriously and that, even though working in showbusiness was fun, 'it is a business nevertheless'.

Wearing a maroon blazer, white shirt 
and patterned tie, he said he did not like being asked whether he had 
ever cheated on his wife, to whom he has been married since 1971.

But questioned further by Mr Vullo if he had ever 'fallen into temptation', Travis admitted he had 'once or twice'.

'Of course, I’m human,' he told the court. 'Consensual, if I might add.'

Travis asked jurors to 'think logically about it'.

He went on: 'If these women supposedly are chasing after me because I was the pop star of the day, the question would have to be, why would I go and assault somebody?

'I don’t like the idea of assaulting women in any way, shape or form.'

Asked
 about claims that he put his hand up a woman’s skirt in front of the 
organiser of a Norwich Union event he was working at, Travis said he 
'should be committed somewhere' if that had happened because it would 
have been bad for business.

'And it didn’t, by the way,' he added.

The
 court heard that he was alleged to have indecently assaulted a woman 
who was working as a stage hand on a pantomime he featured in.

'This is what has been doing my head in about this case, it’s the numbers,' he told jurors.

'It’s because there are quite a few complaints against me that this is any way important to people.

'I hate this idea that there is no smoke without fire.

'I can only say what I know and the way I feel about things.

'If I had been caught doing that in the 
Top Of The Pops studio I should have thought that the book would have 
been thrown at me and I would have been out of the BBC'

'If I had sexually assaulted this girl in my dressing room, I would fully expect her to go and tell her boss and the boss would tell the person running the panto and that would immediately get me in big trouble.'

He dismissed the idea that she would have decided not to complain because he was a celebrity.

'You are never too big in this industry, you can be knocked over very quickly and I don’t believe in taking risks with my business and I certainly don’t believe in attacking young girls,' he said.

Asked about his relationship with the Chuckle Brothers, who also featured in the pantomime, he said that they were 'all showbizzy friends'.

'They were the comedy duo and I was the butt of all their jokes,' he said.

Travis was asked about his interest in 
photography in relation to evidence heard about a picture he took of a 
female pop star in a bikini.

'I will not have them called sleazy,' he said.

He was also questioned about allegations that he grabbed the breasts of a female journalist who came to interview him at his house after asking if she would pose for photographs.

Mr Vullo asked if they were true.

'No, of course not,' he said.

'I’m not likely to get somebody to agree to do a photograph with me if I’m putting my hands all over them. It’s just not the way it works.'

He also denied claims heard yesterday that he groped another journalist.

'After this I will never have an interview with a female again without somebody else sitting there with me,' he said. 'It just breaks my heart.'

Travis was asked about allegations that he assaulted a teenager in his Radio 1 studio during a live broadcast but said he could not remember any such incident.

'This is just lies, out and out,' he said.

'I don’t have to recall that as it never happened.'

Asked if he could have got away with such behaviour while working at the BBC, Travis said: 'I keep saying this, Mr Vullo.

'Yes, my position was quite high up within the echelons of DJs but nobody is bigger than the station - ever.'

The trial was adjourned until 10.30am tomorrow, when Travis will continue to be questioned.
