A university has been slammed after buying prosthetic masks similar to those used in horror films to portray 'depressed and anxious' patients as part of a training course on interacting with the mentally ill.

Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen introduced the masks to students on a mental health nursing course to help depict 'different patients with developing key conditions'.

A character was assigned to each appearance, with ailments including depression, anxiety disorder and, in one case, being the victim of sexual violence. 

Robert Gordon University came under fire for using masks to illustrate mental health conditions as a means of teaching students how to interact with patients. Above, a student talks with 'Sheila', a character who was the victim of sexual abuse as a child 

The 'patients' were also given names, family histories, accents and jobs as part of the exercise. 

'Billy is a north-east farmer with a strong Doric accent who suffers from depression and 'has a strong odour of whisky'. 

'He is a carer for his wife who is being treated for cancer. He has considered suicide and is a problematic alcohol user,' was how the university's described one character. 

Another, called Sheila, 'experienced sexual and physical violence as a child and suffers from an anxiety order'. 

Sheila is portrayed as an elderly woman wearing a head scarf and shirt.

Upon learning of the masks' appearances, See Me, Scotland's largest anti-mental health stigmatisation charity, urged the university to reconsider their use. 

They have since been 'curtailed' from the programme which is now under review. 

'It is not appropriate. Anyone can experience a mental health problem, there isn't one specific way that someone who does should look,' a spokesman for the charity told MailOnline. 

'We had some real concerns with the use of the masks. The way they look is not appropriate, it's the whole package of how they look. 

Scars, tattoos and facial hair were used to characterise each of the characters and their various mental health conditions. Above, a professor plays the role of Jim, a labourer with three children who suffers from a bipolar disorder

'They're not the most positive portrayals, they don't accurately represent people with mental health problems any more than they do the general public.'  

The university apologised for the use of the masks, adding that their 'acceptability' would be re-evaluated.

'It was not our intention to add to the stigmatisation of people with mental health problems,' a spokesman said. 

'In fact we continue to see simulation and role play, which includes the use of volunteer patients and actors, as a useful part of our teaching, particularly in helping students gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of stigma.

'We intend to review our use of masks by further evaluating their acceptability and effectiveness and will again involve a wide range of stakeholders, including people with lived experience, as we have done to date in developing this approach.'
