A number of roads in the Big Apple - Land Rover’s biggest market - were specially sealed off as he took a spin in the new British-built luxury 4X4.

He got out and walked along a line of photographers and guests for a lightning-fast photo session.

After the drive, in which he is see 
clearly passing New York landmarks such as the Empire State building, Craig said: 'I don't think I've ever done anything like that 
before.

'I've done 
plenty of it in movies and we’ve closed stretches off.  But a live 
event? You suddenly think: do I know how to drive? Can I do this?'

He
said of Land Rover: 'We've had a connection with them at Bond for a 
number of years. And they have been very generous with their cars.
