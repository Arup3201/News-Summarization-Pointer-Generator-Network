A top North Korean banker is on the run in remote eastern Russia with £3million of an alleged government slush fund, it has been reported.

Yun Tae Hyong defected to Russia last week and is now seeking asylum in a third country, a source told the South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo.

The official was said to have been in the port city of Nakhodka, an outpost just 120 miles from Russia's ten-mile-long border with North Korea.

Vanished: One of Kim Jong Un's most trusted bankers has defected to Russia, according to reports yesterday

He reportedly handled money personally for the state's feared autocrat Kim Jong Un.

He worked for the Daesong Bank, which is suspected by the U.S. government of being under the control of the North Korean government's Office 39.

The Office is widely believed to finance illicit activities, including buying luxury goods for Kim's inner circle despite them being banned under UN sanctions.

The bank, which focuses on North Korea's rare exchanges with the outside world, was blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2010.

It was set up in 1978 to handle payments by North Korean trading firms, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry's website.

£15million of North Korean cash which the U.S. accused of being used for illicit activities was frozen in 2005 at the Macau-based Banco Delta Asia.

That case stands as practically the only public success in seizing funds from the isolated country.

The newspaper suggested Yun could come to South Korean, adding North Korea had asked Russian authorities for cooperation in efforts to capture him.

It was not clear how he travelled to Russia or what he was doing before he defected. South Korea's Unification Ministry said it had no knowledge of the matter. 

Kim Jong Un is in his early 30s and came to power in December 2011 when his father, Kim Jong Il, died of a heart attack.

Experts are divided as to whether Kim has managed to exert full control over a country in which he sits at the centre of a leadership cult devoted to his father and grandfather.

Kim's uncle Jang Song Thaek, who was also involved in the operation of Office 39, was purged in December last year along with an unknown number of officials connected to him.

Images showed him being paraded before a court before he was led for execution. 

An expert told Reuters that if Yun has  defected, he may not  have extensive knowledge of the regime because even top officials work in a 'compartmentalised' way.

Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea leadership expert at Dongguk University in Seoul, said: '(Officials) are only able to know about their work and commitments. It is hard to know something big beyond that in North Korea.'
