Its been described as everything from terrifying to terrifc - and, with an estimated 68 million daily customers over 35,000 stores across the world, chances are you're going to meet 'Happy' eventually.

For the singing, dancing, talking (and teethy) red box is McDonald's official new ambassador, even if the initial reaction has been anything but, well, happy.

The slightly-menacing if very-simple mascot - an animated Happy Meal box with Gumby-like arms, a massive mouth and huge teeth - was introduced to America via Twitter on Monday as part of the chain's continual healthy image-based overhaul.

But the reception was hardly as warm as the fast food giant was expecting.

Happy mascot: McDonald's introduced its new ambassador to America on Monday, designed to encourage kids to eat healthier. The reaction was small, not super-sized

Entertainment site The A.V. Club called it 'an effective deterrent to both appetite and sleep'.

According to Bloomberg, other reactions included 'THAT! Is scary', 'Epic fail' and 'This makes me crave Burger King'.

'So creepy,' added another user, Onika Abbott.

'Nightmare food,' offered another, John Estey.

But the mega-restaurant's primary market for 'Happy' - as is a lot of the time with McDonald's - is children.

Happy was designed as an attempt to encourage to kids to think about food in a more healthy fashion, coinciding with the release of a new 50-calorie serving of yoghurt and 
applie slices that can, on request, be served with a Happy Meal 
instead of fries.

Small bottles of milk are also now available to replace soft drink.

'At 
McDonald's, we're always looking to bring fun and happiness to 
families,' said Julie Wenger, senior director of U.S. marketing, 
McDonald's.

The
 animated box also seems to have built for the meme and GIF age, with 
news clips and online campaigns spruiking specials and messages easily 
spread throughout social media.

Back in the day: The promotion of fast food has completely transformed over the last three decades. This ad, from 1984, featured then-mascot Hamburglar, stealing and eating as many cheeseburgers as possible

Image overhaul: To show they were doing their part to help fight America's obesitiy epidemic, McDonald's started including apple slices and a smaller portion of french fries in its Happy Meals in 2012. Now, from July 4, parents can opt to replace the fries with a serving of yoghurt

Compared to past mascots like Hamburglar, Grimace and Ronald McDonald himself, it is a minimalistic, almost clinical approach.

There is no back story or costume, just a box with a message.

McDonald's are said to have road-tested Happy in France in 2009 before unleashing him in the USA, which is not only the restaurant's home but its biggest market.

The little guy has also appeared in Australia and New Zealand.

Old school: Up until recently, the McDonald's stable of mascots featured Hamburglar, Ronald and Grimmace. Ronald underwent a makeover and now wears a sports jersey to appear more active

McDonald's Corp. aren't the other ones having an overhaul.

Burger King Worldwide Inc. said yesterday they have dropped their 'Have It Your Way' slogan after 40 years and replaced it with 'Be Your Way'.

The move is meant to better connect with consumers worldwide and highlight the chain's customizable sandwiches.

Burger King have just changed their famous slogan 'Have It Your Way' to 'Be Your Way', as part of their push to have customers customize their own meals
