Punishment: Whitehall¿s Forfeiture Committee has already stripped former RBS boss Fred Goodwin of his knighthood

Bankers who were in charge during the financial crash are set to be stripped of their knighthoods and other honours this year.

Senior Whitehall sources have told the Mail that mandarins will have no choice but to recommend that the Queen removes gongs from the guilty men if they were handed out for services to banking.

In a stark warning to City fatcats who have so far escaped censure, a source has confirmed that Whitehall’s Forfeiture Committee will meet later this year to consider which bankers should be punished for their role in sending the economy into freefall.

The source said that it will ‘be practically impossible’ for the committee not to recommend that their honours are removed.

The Mail has learned that it will meet ‘fairly soon’ formally to remove the knighthood from former HBOS chief executive Sir James Crosby, whose catastrophic mismanagement of the company helped lead to the taxpayer having to bail it out.

The committee last year stripped former RBS boss Fred Goodwin of his knighthood.

But while Sir James has requested that his honour be removed – and agreed to give up one third of his pension – mandarins will also hold a second meeting at which they will consider the fate of other bankers.

That committee – chaired by civil service boss Sir Bob Kerslake – will consider evidence due to be published later this year by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and the Financial Conduct Authority into where the blame lies.

Catching up with him: Sir George Mathewson ran RBS until Fred Goodwin took the helm in 2000

For an honour to be removed a recognised watchdog needs to find against the individual. Honours are formally taken away by the Queen.

A well-placed source with knowledge of the plans said: ‘Where someone has been criticised for their behaviour at a bank and where they got an honour for services to banking it is hard to see how the committee could do anything but recommend that it is taken away.

‘If the question is put, it will be practically impossible to say “No”, given the public mood and the politics of the situation. Where honours have not been given for banking it will be harder.’

That is bad news for Sir Victor Blank, the former chairman of Lloyds bank, who presided over its disastrous takeover of HBOS.

He has always argued that the pitfalls of the deal were not foreseeable. But a recent report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking found that the deal was doomed from the start.

It is understood that the Forfeiture Committee will consider his honour and that of Lord Stevenson, the former HBOS chairman.

The Banking Commission ruled that responsibility for the near-collapse of the bank ‘lies particularly with Lord Stevenson’.

While he cannot be stripped of his peerage by the committee, the knighthood he received in 1997 could be at risk. But insiders admit it will be ‘much more difficult’ to target him because the honour was not awarded for banking.

So far Peter Cummings, head of HBOS corporate banking from 2006 to 2008, is the only man to have been punished over the HBOS scandal.

He was fined £500,000 last year and banned for life from working in the City.
