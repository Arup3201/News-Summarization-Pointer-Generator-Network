A British jihadist fighting for the Islamic State in Iraq has boasted of preparing for ‘martyrdom’.

Reyaad Khan also claimed he is planning on ‘fireworks’ – sparking fears that he could be part of a wave of suicide attacks against US interests in the north of the country.

The 20-year-old former student from Cardiff has already featured alongside two other Britons in a recruitment propaganda video for the terror group released in June.

British jihadist: Reyaad Khan, 20, a former student from Cardiff, has boasted of preparing for 'martyrdom'

Among a series of vile postings are pictures of beheadings, a fighter holding a severed head by his hair, mass executions and corpses.

In his latest tweet, Khan wrote: ‘Spent the day with 2 German brothers waiting 2 do martyrdom ops. The waiting list is so long, we got fireworks for US when they return.’

Significantly, he yesterday tweeted a picture of the door of a US vehicle – supporting claims that Islamic State had captured American military hardware and weapons that belonged to retreating Iraqi forces.

Monitoring of Islamic State’s communications has picked up English being spoken near the captured northern city of Mosul.

Khan’s claims will also give weight to the belief that Britons have crossed from Syria into Iraq to join foreign fighters besieging tens of thousands stranded in the Sinjar mountains.

Officials fear the militants could now be
 planning an offensive in the Kurdish city of Irbil – just 25 miles from
 Islamic State front lines – as well as suicide attacks against 
Americans. 

Post: In his latest tweet, Khan wrote: 'Spent the day with 2 German brothers waiting 2 do martyrdom ops. The waiting list is so long, we got fireworks for US when they return'

British and US interests in Irbil and the capital Baghdad have been on alert for suicide attacks and yesterday more American citizens left the country after intelligence warnings.

Anti-terror investigators have been 
monitoring the tweets of Khan, who once said he wanted to become 
Britain’s first Asian prime minister.

Reyaad Khan

The former student grew up in a terraced house in the Welsh capital in the same road as Abdul Miah, one of the ringleaders of a foiled plot to unleash a Mumbai-style terror attack on London.

Former schoolmates remembered him as a talented scholar who had moderate views and mixed well with people of all backgrounds.

But last year his interest in religion appeared to intensify and he successfully applied to study at the Madinah University in Saudi Arabia, although he did not take up the position.

He is thought to have joined Islamic State last year, appearing on a recruitment video in June.

In the footage, he can be seen cradling 
an assault rifle while sitting with fellow Cardiff students Nasser 
Muthana, 20, and his 17-year-old brother Aseel.

Vile postings: Khan has used Twitter to post a series of gruesome pictures and sickening boasts

Since then he has used Twitter to post a series of gruesome pictures and sickening boasts.

He wrote on July 5: ‘Executed many prisoners yesterday.’ It prompted another fighter from Portsmouth to reply: ‘Epic executions bro, we need to step it up like the brothers in iraq.’

'Probably saw the longest decapitation ever. And we made sure the knife was sharp'

Reyaad Khan

Three days later, he tweeted: ‘Probably saw the longest decapitation ever. And we made sure the knife was sharp.’ On July 16 Khan posted images of blood-soaked corpses.

A few days later it was followed by the message: ‘Anyone want to sponsor my explosive belt? Gucci, give me a shout.’

His messages and images stopped for a period before reappearing several days ago.

Yesterday there were postings suggesting he was eating a meal with fellow Islamic State fighters while watching a beheading. Several pictures showed severed heads or headless corpses.

United Nations War Crimes investigators have confirmed they are aware of the claims made by Khan and are monitoring Islamic State postings.
