UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been accused of putting ‘fear in people’s hearts’ by scaremongering about immigration in a ferocious attack by a Tory minister.

Anna Soubry told Mr Farage 'I don't like your tone' and accused him of spreading ‘prejudice’ instead of using facts.

The outspoken defence minister also appeared to draw parallels between UKIP and the rise of fascism, claiming Mr Farage was using tough economic times to ‘turn to the stranger and you blame them’.

Clash: UKIP leader Nigel Farage became embroiled in an angry exchange with defence minister Anna Soubry

Row: The pair exchanged verbal blows during a heated episode of BBC's Question Time from Boston in Lincolnshire

The extraordinary criticism from one 
of the Tory party’s rising stars will alarm strategists who had warned 
against alienating disaffected voters who had switched to the UK 
Independence Party.

David 
Cameron has been careful not to repeat his 2006 claim that UKIP is a 
‘bunch of fruit cakes and loonies and closet racists’, insisting he will
 now not ‘insult’ those who have chosen to support the anti-EU party.

There
 was anger in Downing Street when veteran Cabinet minister Kenneth 
Clarke suggested some UKIP politicians are racists and its members are 
'clowns'.

His remarks,
 which came just days before the local elections in May, which saw huge 
gains for Mr Farage's party, were disowned by colleagues.

However, appearing on BBC’s Question Time last night Ms Soubry tore into Mr Farage’s populist anti-immigration rhetoric.

Ms Soubry said: ‘I don't like your tone, Mr 
Farage. You do not talk facts. You talk prejudice. That’s what you talk.
 You scaremonger and you put fear in people’s hearts.

‘Look, times are tough. We know that.
 But
 when times are tough, there’s a danger and history tells us when things
 are not good, you turn to the stranger and you blame them.

‘And you 
shouldn’t. That is wrong. And I’m proud of our country’s history and I’m
 proud that people come here.’

Anna Soubry describes herself as a 'tough old bird' and is not afraid to speak her mind, even if it is not government policy.

The former TV presenter fronted This Morning in the 1980s and retrained spent 15 years as a barrister before being elected MP for Broxtowe in 2010.

The single mother-of-two was quickly promoted to public health minister, but complained she was only given the job because it is 'a soft bloody girly option'.

She also warned rebellious Tories to stop 'quite a lot of t*******' and focus on winning the election.

Later, she said it was possible to tell a poor person because they were often fat, complained about the size of cakes and said eating a sandwich at your desk is 'disgusting'.

In last month's reshuffle she was moved to become the first Tory woman minister at the Ministry of Defence.

The searing critique came after Mr 
Farage again warned of the threat of an influx of Romanians and 
Bulgarians into the UK when working restrictions are lifted next year.

He said he warned about a similar increase in immigration from Poland a decade ago.

The Labour government predicted a population increase of 13,000 people per year, he said.

‘I
 said that was nonsense because logic said if you extend to poor people 
the ability to come to a rich country they’ll come in huge numbers. And 
in the first two years, 800,000 people came. That…is a fact.’

But during angry exchanges, a member of the audience accused him of ‘bandying about figures’ and ‘scaremongering’.

The government has refused to provide an official estimate for the number of people expected to come from Bulgaira and Romania, but privately expect it to be much lower than those from Poland because Britain is among the last countries to lift the restrictions.

Ms Soubry said: ‘People come here to work.

'They come to Boston to work and they work in the fields as you know. They pick the vegetables.

‘The real debate is about why there are so many people in our country who choose not to work. I don’t like your tone Mr Farage.

‘You talk about facts – in my constituency your party put out a leaflet saying 29 million people from Romania and Bulgaria were going to flood into our country.

'The population is only 27.5 million of the two of them.’

But Mr Farage insisted young people in Britain were unable to find jobs because wages had been undercut by migrant workers.

Criticism: The Tories had moved to tone down attacks on UKIP, after David Cameron called them 'fruitcakes and racists' in 2006 and earlier this year Ken Clarke dismissed the party as 'clowns'

Today he hit back, branding Ms Soubry's attack ‘pretty unpleasant’.

Mr Farage said: ‘I don’t like it but it is exactly what I expect. The main motivation of the political class in this country is its own self-perpetuation and there is no depth to which they are not prepared to stoop to try and maintain that status quo.

‘They are getting very concerned about UKIP but I think their fear is now broader than just the European elections,' he told the Telegraph.

'You only have to look at the results from district and country council by-elections up and down the country to see that UKIP is very consistently and clearly out-performing its poll-ratings.

'People are beginning to vote UKIP in domestic elections as well as in European elections.’
