She's
 no stranger to being handed awards for being sexy - she has won 
Sexiest Soap Star five years on the trot and recently beat Kim Kardashian and Rihanna to be crowned best bikini body.

But despite her enviable curves, you won't find Michelle Keegan breaking a sweat in the gym or starving herself on a juice diet.

Speaking about her summer health regime, the former Coronation Street star told MailOnline: 'I haven't had any time for exercise, I'm gutted. I feel so much better when I do work out.

'I don't believe in crash diets or detoxes, I can't live like that. If I have a bad day then I'll have a good day the next.'

How does she do it? Michelle Keegan, who 
showcases her svelte figure in her new Lipsy campaign, has revealed that
 she doesn't work out religiously, dress, £65 

The star, who shows off her enviable figure in her new Lipsy campaign revealed that she tries to fit in 40 minute workouts but 'doesn't like the gym'.

When it comes to her diet, she isn't interested in sugary treats but has more of a 'savoury tooth' and loves crisps and sandwiches although, one look at her new Lipsy campaign, and you'd never guess.

With her showstopping hourglass physique and savvy style, Michelle Keegan is the envy of women worldwide.

Fashion brand Lipsy wanted to tap into the Michelle magic and called on Weatherfield's most stylish export to collaborate on a collection.

After months of hard work, the range is finally here - all modelled by the former Coronation Street star herself, of course.

It's not fair! Despite having one of the best 
bikini bodies in Britain, Michelle doesn't even like the gym and enjoys 
eating sandwiches and crisp, dress, £60

Lipsy stores.

Speaking at the launch of her range on Wednesday, the 26-year-old told MailOnline: 'Coming in here and seeing the clothes and my name up in lights is amazing, it's made it really real now and I keep having to pinch myself.

'I have been working on it for so long and created collages of my favourite red carpet looks and colours and shapes that I love so it's full of things I wear myself. I would describe it as quite minimalistic, classic and tailored with a girly edge.

'It's my dream come true and I hope to design for many years to come.'

The chic range of figure-hugging dresses, cosy coats and on-trend totes was based around Michelle's own fashion choices and outfits she's worn in the past.

Michelle added: 'I have spent a lot of time over
 the last few months working closely with the Lipsy design team to make 
sure that each piece in my collection is something I am excited about 
wearing.

'My collection is classic, unfussy and feminine in style, and I can’t wait for it to hit the high street and see everyone wearing it.'

Speaking about the inspiration behind her range, she cited a certain fashionista as her muse.

'I love Victoria Beckham's style, she is effortlessly chic and looks amazing whenever she steps out.'

Michelle, who loves high street stores Zara, Mango and Topshop - because you can get 'value for your money' - also shares style tips with fiance, Mark Wright.
