Badly behaved: Richard Dawe was jailed after he threw mud at his neighbours' windows in Castlemorton Common, Worcestershire

An Asbo pensioner who terrorised his neighbours living in a quiet village for 14 years has been jailed after he threw mud at their windows.

Richard Dawe, 78, breached a restraining order banning him from walking on a path next to his neighbours’ properties.

Dawe has a string of Asbos - including for singing Oh What A Beautiful Morning and Tom Jones' classic Delilah - at the top of his voice outside their homes.

He also swore at his neighbours, 
attacked one with a shovel and made peacock noises to annoy a woman who 
he claimed played her radio too loudly.

His
bizarre hate campaign against his long-suffering neighbours in the 
pretty village of Castlemorton Common, Worcestershire, dates back to 
1998.

He was finally jailed
for six months on Wednesday after he was caught on CCTV lobbing clumps 
of mud and stone at his neighbour’s garage window which smashed.

Judge
Robert Juckes said Dawe - who once claimed he was the ‘Godfather of 
Castlemorton’ - should have 'learned at your age how to conduct 
yourself'.

'But you have 
not,' Judge Juckes told him, adding: 'You have found it necessary to 
intimidate, frustrate, harass and annoy those about you.

'The
courts have done everything to avoid a prison sentence. The court has 
to enforce its orders and the neighbours are entitled to this short rest
from your activities.'

Worcester Crown Court heard Dawe was 
given a suspended sentence in September 2010 for shouting abuse at his 
neighbours, including calling resident Vivian Schooling, 68, a 'split 
a***'.

The court heard Dawe 
was given a 16-week prison sentence suspended for two years in 2010 but 
last November he smashed another resident’s garage window.

Stephen
Davies, prosecuting, told the court the problems with his neighbours 
started in 1998 which included him 'making bird noises' and even 
'hitting a neighbour with a shovel'.

In
2005, he was slapped with a 15-year Crasbo banning him from contacting 
his neighbours, using threatening words or behaviour or driving a 
vehicle to annoy other people or making any unjustified noise.

In 2010, he breached the order by 
going past his neighbour singing Liza Minnelli hit ‘Life Is A Cabaret’ 
and making insulting remarks.

Richard Bond, defending, said the neighbour disputes were not 'one-way traffic'. He said: 'Mr Dawe’s access to their shared septic tank had been cut off.

'Mr Dawe had thrown mud because his neighbour’s dogs were making a noise and he had not intended to break the window.'

He added that the breaches of the Crasbo came about because he was watering a track he was banned from in order to 'keep down the dust'.

After the hearing, Dawe’s neighbours expressed relief he was finally behind bars.

One woman, who did not want to be named, said: 'It is unfortunate that Mr Dawe has been jailed but we deserve protection from him.

'All we want to do is to live our lives in peace. If nothing else, we will get a few months respite before he is released.'
