A 21-year-old college student has been charged with creating ricin after two concerned professors turned him in.

Kyle Allen Smith allegedly told a biology teacher at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh he was planning something 'borderline illegal' and planned to use the chemical as 'a biological weapon'.

It came after he approached a chemistry professor on October 29, asking him about oil and protein extraction from seeds to make 'ribosomal-inhibiting proteins' - a potentially lethal concoction.

Charged: Kyle Allen Smith, 21, was turned in by two of his professors as they believed he was making ricin 

That night, the professor approach police with fears Smith was making ricin.

A notebook documenting how to create ricin was also seized, authorities told Fox 6.

If found guilty, Smith faces 10 years in prison and up to $250,000 in fines. 

Fears: Smith allegedly approached a biology and a chemistry professor asking how to extract oil and protein, which is a method to create 'ribosomal-inhibiting proteins' - a potentially lethal concoction
