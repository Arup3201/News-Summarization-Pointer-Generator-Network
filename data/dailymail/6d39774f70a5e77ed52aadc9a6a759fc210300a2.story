A million housewives every day pick up a tin of beans and say... well, that was the advertising jingle that was seen in more than a million homes every day. And now it is all changing.

The humble baked bean has had a luxury makeover. No, not just mini pork sausages or mini burgers... From tomorrow, the Queen’s grocer Fortnum & Mason is offering up gourmet baked beans — at £3.95 a tub.

Like the traditional tinned variety, Proper Beans can be heated up on the hob or in the microwave. But there the similarities stop.

Unlike their tinned cousins, Proper Beans have to be kept in the fridge and are available in four (not 57) varieties, including British Fava Beans And Smoked Pork Collar, and Ham Hock, Potato And Thyme.

The range is the brainchild of 33-year-old Londoner Ben Mason.

‘Some people said, “You’re completely crazy,”’ he says. ‘Most people think that beans can’t change.’

But he is hoping for a case of history repeating itself. It was in Fortnum’s Piccadilly store that another young entrepreneur, Henry Heinz from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, introduced the baked bean to Britain in 1886 marketed as an expensive foreign delicacy.
