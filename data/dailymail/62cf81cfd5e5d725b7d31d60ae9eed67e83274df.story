Nottingham Forest have signed Matty Fryatt on a three-year deal.

Fryatt will move to the City Ground on a free transfer when his contract at Hull expires at the end of this month.

The striker rejected the offer of fresh terms with the Barclays Premier League club, whom he helped to reach last season's FA Cup final, in favour of a switch to Stuart Pearce's team.

The 28-year-old has long been a target for the Reds, who have tried to sign him on at least two previous occasions.

But incoming manager Pearce, who will officially begin in the role on July 1, has swooped to conclude a deal for the former Walsall and Leicester forward.

'I am delighted to announce the signing of Matty Fryatt on a three-year contract, he is a player this club has admired for many years,' Forest owner and chairman Fawaz Al Hasawi said via his official Twitter account.

'I am delighted to have finally got our man. I look forward to welcoming him into this great club when his contract starts on July 1.'

The move brings to an end Fryatt's three and a half years with Hull. After joining from Leicester in January 2011, he finished the season with nine goals in his first 18 league appearances.

He was the Tigers' top scorer during the 2011/12 campaign with 16 goals and after injury disrupted his progress the following season, Fryatt rediscovered his form in 2013/14, first through a loan spell with Sheffield Wednesday and then on his return to the KC Stadium, scoring some key goals in the club's run to the FA Cup final.

Fryatt leaves Hull with 31 goals in 94 appearances to his name.
