Four in 10 people are so disconnected from politics they might not vote, new research shows.

The alienated voters do not trust people in public life and are left unimpressed by all political parties. The Commons anti-sleaze watchdog warns that the under-30s are particularly disenchanted, raising fears for the voter turnout in the future.

The Committee on Standards in Public Life
sounded the alarm on voter apathy after comedian Russell Brand and 
Newsnight’s Jeremy Paxman said they had chosen to vote because they were
so unimpressed by the choices on offer.

Apathy: Jeremy Paxman and Russell Brand have admitted in recent weeks not voting after being left unimpressed by today's crop of politicians

A poll by the committee found a ‘considerable proportion’ of the British population, around 40 per cent of those surveyed, were ‘disconnected’ or ‘alienated’ from the domain of party politics.

‘For them, the system offers no party sufficiently attractive to win their vote,’ the committee said.

‘These citizens in particular hold sceptical or deeply sceptical perceptions of standards and do not trust those in public life.’

They are not just disconnected by the incumbent government, but are also turned off by the opposition and even the newer, smaller political parties like the Greens, UKIP and the BNP.

Voters are also now more likely to say MPs will take bribes, lie and are out of touch.

The committee warned: ‘This alienated group of citizens just sees no party that could sufficiently express their political views or represent their interests, and is overwhelmingly sceptical or deeply sceptical about public life.

‘Moreover, they are particularly located in the younger age groups, with 46 per cent of the under 30s falling into this category.’

Lord Bew, who chairs the committee, told The Independent: ‘One particular cause for concern from the research is the number of people, especially young people, who feel disconnected from the political system and political parties.’

The row over high profile stars refusing to vote erupted after Russell Brand said he had never voted because he regarded politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant.

He told the BBC: 'I'm angry, because for me its real. this is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution.

'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.'

Mr Paxman took him to task in a high profile interview but later admitted he finds the current parties so uninspiring he also has not bothered to vote.

The Newsnight host  revealed he failed to cast a ballot in a recent election because he was unable to choose between rival candidates.

Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Paxman said: ‘In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising.

‘By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write “none of the above” on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.’

But Mr Paxman was heavily criticised by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for setting a bad example.

Mr Clegg said: ‘He’s a guy who gets paid £1million or thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers, he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics.’
