These stunning images of Britain's glorious countryside, featuring stunning sunsets, swimming seals and serene streams, have been shortlisted for a Woodland Trust photo competition.

The pictures, which show the great outdoors at its best, were chosen from more than 6,000 entries for the prestigious competition. 

A breathtaking image of a sunset over Dunraven Bay, near Bridgend, south Wales, taken by Joaquim Pinho, from Brighton, wowed the judges and was selected as the overall winner.

Peek-a-boo: Yasmin Hussain's entry was a close-up photograph of a damsel fly peering over a leaf

The winning image shows three people walking up the wet sands of the beach as the sun sets over a cliff which looms in the background.

The competition was hotly contested, with images of Britain's countryside and wildlife making the judges' decision incredibly difficult.

Other stunning snaps include a harvest mouse perched on a branch of blackberries, taken by Brian Robinson, and a cascading waterfall by John Shahabeddin.

Entries showing a damsel fly peering over the end of a leaf, dragonflies reflected in a pond, a white-tailed eagle and a kingfisher catching a stickleback provided further stiff competition.

The aim of the contest, organised by the Woodland Trust and Kelly's of Cornwall, was to capture one of life's simple pleasures - enjoying the British countryside.

Beccy Speight, chief executive of the Woodland Trust, said: 'To receive so many entries just goes to show how inspiring the great outdoors can be and Joaquim's image is a worthy winner.

'It's hugely important to try and create a lasting connection between people and the natural environments they visit, perhaps leading them to help us plant more trees, restore ancient woodland and protect it from disease and development.'

Winner Mr Pinho, who volunteers for the Woodand Trust, added: 'Winning the Woodland Trust photo competition is a great honour.

'It's even more special for me as the accolade comes from a conservation charity that I volunteer with. Having my photography recognised has made me want to spend even more time outdoors.' 

Mr Pinho won a four-night break at a lodge in Cornwall, as well as meal for four at MasterChef restaurant, The Green Room.
