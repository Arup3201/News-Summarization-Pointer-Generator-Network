The teenage girl forced to resign as the country's first youth crime commissioner after offensive rants were discovered on her Twitter account will not face police action, it was confirmed today.

Paris Brown, 17, was appointed to the Â£15,000-a-year role to help Kent Police 'stay in touch with young people' by providing their views on policing, but stepped down amid claims tweets she posted on her personal account were homophobic, racist and violent.

The teenager was questioned over the posts by officers from Kent Police's Special Branch, but the force said today it would take 'no further action' after concluding the case 'does not pass the evidential threshold for prosecution'.

No further action: It has been confirmed that Paris Brown, seen right next to Kent's Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes, will not face police action over her offensive tweets

A spokeswoman for Kent Police said today: 'We have spoken to the CPS about our findings, and given them our view that this case does not pass the evidential threshold for prosecution; we will make no recommendations to them for charges and will take no further police action having discharged our duty to investigate.

'Whilst some of the language used is offensive, particularly the comments which derogatorily refer to particular social groups, we do not believe that in the context they are grossly offensive on a reasonable objective assessment considering intent,' the statement went on.

Remorse: The 17-year-old, who denies being racist or homophobic, as apologised for any offence caused by the messages posted online

In tweets posted on her personal account before she was appointed youth crime commissioner, Miss Brown called homosexuals 'fags', immigrants 'illegals' and travellers 'pikeys', and said she had 'a thing for older men'.

In another tweet she wrote: 'I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.'

Miss Brown also posted: 'Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a ******* fag', in reference to the Channel 4 reality show.

The Twitter account, which has since been deleted, was not checked as part of the recruitment process.

Miss Brown, from Sheerness in Kent has since apologised for causing offence with the messages she posted between the ages of 14 and 16.

She denied being anti-gay or racist, and said she is against taking drugs, insisting that the reference on Twitter to making 'hash brownies' was from a Scooby Doo film.

The teenager's Twitter account was not checked as part of the recruitment process.

Lawyers for Miss Brown had described Kent Police's decision to seize her mobile phone and question her under caution in the wake of the storm over her online comments as 'wholly disproportionate'.

Law firm Olswang wrote to Kent Police Chief Constable Ian Learmonth to argue that the scope and nature of the investigation was 'unjustified having regard to the Twitter material itself and the broader circumstances of the case'.

But Kent Police said at the time it was reacting to complaints from members of the public and seeking to establish whether any offences had been committed.

The force received more than 50 complaints after details of Miss Brown's tweets came to light.
