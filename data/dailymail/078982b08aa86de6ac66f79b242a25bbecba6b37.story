All three home nations made it through to the rugby sevens quarter finals - albeit with none of the sides topping their groups in the pool stage.

England lost out to Australia in Pool D after being dominated in a strong second half from the southern hemisphere side, Wales were beaten to top spot in Pool C by Samoa and Scotland's narrow defeat to champions New Zealand meant they too were runners up.

As a result, England will face Samoa, Wales come up against the Aussies and Scotland will play South Africa in Sunday's quarter finals.

Facing Samoa: England's Charles Hayter

Facing South Africa: Scotland's Scott Wrigh

Facing Australia: Wales' Luke Morgan

Runner up: James Rodwell, complete with a ripped shirt, makes a run for England at Ibrox on Saturday

If England and Scotland both come out on top of their quarter finals they would face each other in the semis with a guaranteed medal up for grabs.

Meanwhile a win for Wales would most likely give them a tough tie against New Zealand, who have never lost a match in Commonwealth Games history.

The sevens tournament concludes on Sunday with the final scheduled for 21:37 at Ibrox.
