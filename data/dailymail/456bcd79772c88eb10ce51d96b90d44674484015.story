A California man attending a huge electronic music party in Las Vegas died Saturday morning after he was taken to a hospital.

The Clark County coroner's office identified the Electric Daisy Carnival attendee as 24-year-old Montomery Tsang of San Leandro.

His cause of death wasn't immediately announced.

Reputation: The festival used to be known as a place for drink, drugs and debauchery. These days people are better behaved but one person still died

Event producer Insomniac issued a statement saying it was 'deeply saddened' by the death and hoped attendees would do their part to keep the weekend-long gathering safe.

Organizers estimate 134,000 people attended the opening night Friday.

Las Vegas police say of nearly 250 mostly minor medical calls the first night, only five resulted in trips to the hospital.

They also reported 29 drug-related felony arrests.

The event was criticized in Los Angeles in 2010 after a 15-year-old girl's fatal drug overdose.

Better behavior: Electric Daisy Carnival moved to Las Vegas four years ago from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum after the 2010 death of a 15-year-old attendee who was treated for drug intoxication

According to the Las Vegas Sun, Tsang collapsed in a parking lot outside the concert venue under unclear circumstances.

The Electric Daisy Carnival originated in Los Angeles but was moved to Las Vegas in 2010 after the death of a 15-year-old attendee due to drug intoxication.

Four deaths in 2013 exposed widespread use of illegal stimulants at concerts, raves and electronic dance music shows, along with the difficulties encountered by organizers to keep those substances out.

'Drugs have always been a big part of the scene and always will be,' said Amy Raves, a Los Angeles-based rave advocate who has attended dozens of electronic music shows.

'The idea is how to promote safer raving, to educate kids that abstinence is the best policy, but to realize that's not always practical,' she said.
