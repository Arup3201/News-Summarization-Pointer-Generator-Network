The heroic doctor who stopped a psychiatric patient's deadly rampage at a Philadelphia hospital last week has been pictured for the first time as he heals from his wounds at home.

Dr Lee Silverman used his own gun to shoot down patient Richard Plotts who snapped and shot dead his mental health caseworker Theresa Hunt during a session last Thursday.

But an armed Dr Silverman stopped Plotts before he could take another victim, by using his own gun to injure the 49-year-old mental patient.

Dr Silverman was injured in the shootout but has since been released from the hospital. In pictures posted to Facebook, Silverman is shown wearing a bandage on his head and hand. In another photo, his daughter holds up a drawing of her father.

'My dad is a hero,' she writes above the picture.

The hospital horror unfolded on Thursday afternoon when patient Plotts arrived at the Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital with Hunt where they met Dr Silverman in an office at the psychiatric unit on the third floor of the hospital.

Once inside, the calamitious series of events began with a heated argument that ended with Hunt being fatally shot in the head, Dr Silverman also suffering a hit to the head and Plotts critically wounded after two gunshot wounds to the torso and one to his arm.

It was Dr. Silverman's quick reaction that saved lives and police have hailed him as a hero for stopping Plotts before he could embark on a gun rampage.

Yeadon Police Chief Donald Molineux said that 'without a doubt, I believe the doctor saved lives.'

'Without
 that firearm, this guy (the patient) could have went out in the hallway
 and just walked down the offices until he ran out of ammunition,' the 
chief said.

after he shot dead his caseworker, Theresa Hunt

Whelan identified the caseworker killed Thursday afternoon at Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital as Theresa Hunt, 53.

Hunt, who was from Philadelphia, had accompanied Plotts to an appointment with Silverman at a psychiatric crisis center adjacent to the hospital in Darby, just southwest of Philadelphia, authorities said.

'When the caseworker was shot, (Silverman) crouched down behind the desk to avoid him being shot,' Whelan said.

'He was able to reach for his weapon, and realizing it was a life or death situation, was able to engage the defendant in the exchange of gunfire.'

A struggle ensued and spilled out into the hallway, Whelan said. Another doctor and a caseworker jumped in to help Silverman and secure Plotts' weapon, he said.

The motive for the shooting remained unclear late Thursday, although Whelan said Plotts, of Upper Darby, might have had issues with the doctor over his treatment plan.

However, it's unclear if that's why Silverman was armed, apparently against hospital policy.

'We do believe that there were some issues between the doctor and the patient, but whether or not he actually feared him is unclear,' the prosecutor said.

'From all accounts, (he) would have acted in self-defense.'

As of Sunday, Plotts, 49, was still in fair condition at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, while Silverman had been treated and released.

Telephone calls to the doctor's home went unanswered.

Fatal shooting: Several victims were reported after shots were fired at the Darby Borough hospital and at least one victim has died

Suspect: Shots broke out around 2pm but by 3pm reports from the scene indicated the suspected shooter was in custody

Swarm: Shots rang out at the Delaware County facility around 2pm and SWAT teams quickly descended on the building

Plotts does not have a listed home phone number. Court records in Delaware County show a man of the same name and age with a lengthy criminal record, but Whelan was uncertain if they were the same person.

The hospital has a policy barring anyone except on-duty law enforcement officers from carrying weapons on its campus, a spokeswoman for the Mercy Health System said.

But Molineux insisted Silverman was a hero who saved lives.

Two guns were recovered from the scene, Whelan said.

Staff members had heard loud arguing inside Silverman's office during the appointment.

They opened the door and noticed the patient had a gun pointed at the doctor, so they quietly closed the door and dialed 911, Whelan said. Gunshots were heard a short time later, just before 2:30 p.m.

About 100 people were evacuated. The shooting reportedly occurred on a third floor psych ward

Plotts, severely wounded from several shots, emerged from the office, and another doctor and a caseworker helped wrestle him to the floor of the hallway and grabbed his weapon, Whelan said.

'They acted vigilantly. They acted bravely,' he said.

The exchange of gunfire occurred on the third floor of the Wellness Center at Mercy Fitzgerald, a 204-bed community teaching hospital. Authorities said there are no surveillance cameras in the doctor's office or the waiting area outside.

They also said the center had no metal detectors.

Patients waiting in the first-floor lobby reported a tense scene when police arrived and ordered everyone out. Most of the patients were elderly.

'I dozed off, and I heard the cop shouting, "Come on, come on, get out!"' said Millicent Russell, of Lansdowne, who was waiting for a 3 p.m. appointment.

'There were people with walkers and canes and stuff. All these cops were outside running here and there with these guns.'

The distraught family of
 Hunt have vented their 
fury at her killer online.

Her 
sister, Martha Trinca, took to Facebook to label Richard Plotts -  who 
was critically wounded by hero Dr. Lee Silverman when he returned fire -
 a 'SOB' who 'needs to rot in hell forever'.

Anger: This is the message that Theresa Hunts sister, Martha Trinca, posted to Facebook on Saturday expressing her rage at her sister's killer

Tears: Dennis Hunt fought back his emotions as he tried to explain how he will feel and cope with the loss of his sister, Theresa, who was shot dead in Philadelphia on Thursday

The
 caseworker's devastated brother, Dennis Hunt, said that he was 'angry' 
at Plotts, 49, for taking Theresa's life, telling reporters that the 
youngest of nine children was known by her siblings as 'Mother Theresa' 
for her compassion.

Writing
 on Facebook about her awful loss, Martha Trinca said that her sister 
was her 'best friend' and 'I'm glad I told her every time we talked how 
much I love her!! I will cherish our time together for the rest of my 
life!!'

Her clearly emotional brother, Dennis, struggled to get through his interview with ABC 6 and said he wants to ask Plotts why he kiled his little sister.

'I
 want people to remember my sister as someone who was strong and stands 
up for what she believes in and good hearted... I don't know what to 
say,' said Dennis to ABC 6.

'I think that doctor who actually was armed, I think was incredible, what he did.'
