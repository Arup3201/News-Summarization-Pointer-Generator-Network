Shots rang out Saturday night outside the Delaware home of Vice President Joe Biden.

Multiple rounds were fired from a vehicle speeding past the New Castle County residence around 8:25pm, according to the Secret Service.

'This occurred on a public road outside the established security perimeter. The shots were heard by Secret Service personnel posted at the residence and a vehicle was observed by an agent leaving the scene at a high rate of speed,' Secret Service spokesman Robert Hoback told CNN.

The Vice President and his physician wife were expected to be in Delaware over the weekend, but were not home during the incident, officials said.

According to CBS News, the couple was 'out for the evening.' 

The Secret Service informed them of the shooting and promised a thorough search of the grounds.

The shots were fired several hundred yards from the home. The road lies outside a perimeter secured by Secret Service.

According to the New York Times, New Castle County police and Secret Service agents were unable to catch the shooter as he or she sped away.

During the subsequent investigation, a car reportedly sped past agents and was pulled over.

The driver's hands tested negative for gunpowder residue.

'The Secret Service is working closely with the New Castle County Police on investigating this incident,' Edwin Donovan, a spokesman for the Secret Service, told the Times.

Biden's neighborhood includes stately stone-and-brick homes along a curving two-lane road that winds through rolling hills. Nestled in a heavily wooded area, the vice president's home is not visible from the main road. A small cottage, occupied by the Secret Service, sits on the property near a gate in front of the driveway that is blocked off by Secret Service vehicles and personnel.

Police said there was a report of shots fired in the nearby area of Hoopes Reservoir, just northwest of the Biden home. The reservoir is a source of fresh water for Wilmington.

Biden's office said the vice president and his wife, Jill Biden, were briefed Saturday night, as was President Barack Obama. Biden's office referred all other questions to the Secret Service.

On Sunday afternoon, half a dozen sport utility vehicles were parked near the entrance of the Bidens' property, providing a heavy security presence in the area. Shortly before 2 p.m., a motorcade of several more SUVs arrived at the house. It was unclear whether the vice president was in any of the vehicles.

Biden planned to speak Monday in Wilmington at the Organization of Minority Women's 31st Annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast.

The Bidens spend many weekends at their Delaware home, and, while he served in the Senate, Biden frequently made a daily commute from Delaware to Washington by train.
