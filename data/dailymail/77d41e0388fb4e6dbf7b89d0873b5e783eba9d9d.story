Scotland Yard declared war on Rupert Murdoch's News International last night over a 'deliberate' attempt to derail the phone-hacking and police bungs investigation into the News of the World.

Senior officers are disgusted by a series of leaks from within the company revealing confidential details of the Met's inquiry.

The final straw came yesterday when the Queen and the Royal Family were drawn into the scandal engulfing the Murdoch machine.

Security risk: Details of the movements of the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were offered for sale to journalists

The BBC's business editor Robert Peston broke the astonishing news that the Sunday newspaper was paying a corrupt Royal Protection Officer for highly sensitive personal details about the Monarch, her close family and staff – a clear danger to security.

The London Evening Standard was also briefed on the claims and within hours Scotland Yard issued an unprecedented and angry statement pointing the finger firmly at the News International empire.

After days of leaks, the Met finally lost patience, saying: 'It is our belief that information that has appeared in the media today is part of a deliberate campaign to undermine the investigation into the alleged payments by corrupt journalists to corrupt police officers.

'At various meetings over the last few weeks information was shared with us by News International and their legal representatives and it was agreed by all parties that this information would be kept confidential so that we could pursue various lines of inquiry, identify those responsible without alerting them, and secure best evidence.

'However, we are extremely concerned and disappointed that the continuous release of selected information – that is only known by a small number of people – could have a significant impact on the corruption investigation.'

The revelation that the Queen and her family had been targeted was the latest sensational development in the hacking and corruption scandal.

According to the BBC's Mr Peston the company uncovered emails back in 2007 containing evidence a reporter was asking for £1,000 payments to give to the royal protection officer for confidential information about the Queen.

In one of the emails Clive Goodman, 
the newspaper's disgraced former royal editor jailed for phone-hacking, 
requests cash from News of the World editor Andy Coulson to buy the 
Green Book, a confidential royal directory. The emails imply that the 
officer had stolen the directory.

Contrary
to some reports yesterday, it does not contain private and direct 
numbers for senior Royals. It contains numbers for main switchboards and
specific departments within the official residences.

Nevertheless,
the book – which has the word 'secure' on the cover – is so sensitive 
that when members of the Royal Household get a copy they must sign for 
it.

On his BBC blog Mr 
Peston quotes a source saying: 'There was clear evidence from the emails
that the security of the Royal family was being put at risk. It is 
quite astonishing that these emails were not handed to the police for 
investigation when they were first found in 2007.'

The information 
being offered by the Royal Protection officer also included tips about 
the Queen's movements but, despite the potential risk to royal security,
they were not passed to Scotland Yard until last month.

Goodman, 53, and Mr Coulson, 43, have been arrested and bailed until October on suspicion of bribing police officers. Buckingham Palace and Clarence House would not comment. Police say the leaks have forced the Yard to 'rip up' its investigations strategy, including the timetable of planned arrests.

Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick's team of 50 investigators is vetted to high level and has sworn a confidentiality oath.

A senior Yard source: 'We are 110 per cent certain that leaks have not come from Met.
