She's known for recycling her outfits. And this time, the similarity was easy to spot.

Visiting an art gallery yesterday, the Duchess of Cambridge had on the same Dalmatian-print coat she wore while pregnant with Prince George.

Kate, whose second child is due in six weeks, accessorised with Stuart Weitzman suede pumps, a Mulberry clutch bag and Annoushka earrings.

Body of work: The Duchess of Cambridge peers at an eerily realistic 'corpse' lying on the gallery floor

She was last seen wearing the £169 coat from high street label Hobbs at a ship’s naming ceremony in 2013.

Yesterday’s visit took a macabre twist when Kate was confronted with a ‘dead body’ lying on the gallery floor.

‘Oh my goodness, what’s that?’ said the duchess as she peered at the eerily realistic bodycast made of silicone by artist Jeremy Millar. 

Titled ‘Self Portrait as a Drowned Man’, it is so lifelike visiting parents have been warned to make sure their children realise it is not the real thing. 

But Kate took it in her stride during her visit to the Turner Contemporary gallery in Margate, Kent.

The 33-year-old, who has a 2:1 history of art degree from St Andrews, looked delighted to be indulging her arty side.

She chatted to artist Gavin Turk, although she seemed more interested in his beard, explaining that her brother James has been growing facial hair of his own. 

Mr Turk said afterwards: ‘She immediately asked me about my beard. She said she was a bit concerned as her brother was growing one.’

Kate also admitted that she sometimes finds it hard to remember she is expecting. 

Artist Jenny Cranstone, who chatted with her, revealed: ‘I said, “You’re looking very trim.” She said, “I sometimes forget I’m pregnant”.’
