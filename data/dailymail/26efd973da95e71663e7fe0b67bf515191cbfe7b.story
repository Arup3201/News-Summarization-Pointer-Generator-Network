A white homeowner who gunned down an unarmed 19-year-old black woman on his porch last year has been sentenced to at least 17 years in prison.

Theodore Wafer was convicted of second-degree murder in August for killing Renisha McBride outside his home in Dearborn Heights in Detroit, Michigan home in the early hours of November 2.

Before getting his sentence, 55-year-old Wafer apologized to McBride's family, saying he killed a woman who was 'too young to leave this world'.

'I apologize from the bottom of my heart, I am truly sorry for your loss and I can only hope and pray that somehow you can forgive me,' Wafer said, pausing to control his emotions.

Sentenced: Theodore Wafer is led from the courtroom on Wednesday after he was sentenced to 17 years for shooting a teenager on his porch last year. He was convicted of second-degree murder last month

Sadness: Jasmine McBride, 23, the sister of 19-year-old victim Renisha, McBride reads an impact statement before the court during the sentencing on Wednesday. Wafer apologized to the family in court

'From my 
fear, I caused the loss of a life that was too young to leave this world
 and for that I'll carry that guilt and sorrow forever.'

In response, Judge Dana Margaret Hathaway, called it 'one of the saddest cases' she's heard.

'I am 
confident that if you weren't going to prison today, you would never 
commit another crime,' she said. 'I
 fully recognize that you did not bring these circumstances to your 
doorstep. They arrived there. But once you did, you made the choices 
that brought you here today.'

Wafer was convicted last month after a nine-day trial that centered on whether he had a reasonable and honest belief that his safety was in peril.

Gunned down: Renisha McBride, 19, was shot dead on Wafer's porch after she crashed her car nearby and banged on his front door in the early hours of the morning. The jury did not believe he was in danger

Relief: Walter Simmons, the victim's father, said outside court that he was happy with the sentence

Decisions: Judge Dana Hathaway said in court on Wednesday that she believes Wafer would never commit another crime if he were freed but that he made the wrong choices that fateful morning

He 
testified that he was awakened by pounding on his doors and shot McBride
 - who was found to be extremely drunk - because he feared for his life.
 But a jury rejected his claim of self-defense.

Wafer
 is white and McBride was black, and some wondered whether race may have
 been a factor, likening it to the shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon 
Martin - but race was hardly mentioned at the trial. 

Prosecutors
 recommended at least 17 years in prison for Wafer, including two years 
for unlawful use of a gun. Defense attorney Cheryl Carpenter asked for 
as few as six years in prison.

Noting Wafer's age, Carpenter said at the hearing Wednesday that anything more than 10 years in prison would be a 'life sentence'.

After the sentencing, McBride's sister, Jasmine, told NBC: 'I'm very happy. I believe justice was served and I believe my sister can rest peacefully now.' 

Emotional: Monica McBride, the mother of the victim, is pictured crying during the guilty verdict last month

No one knows why McBride ended up at Wafer's home about 4.30am, although prosecutors speculated she may have been seeking help. She had crashed her car into a parked car about a half-mile away in Detroit around 1am. An autopsy found she was extremely drunk.

Wafer opened the front door and shot McBride in the face, firing through a screen door. He first suggested to police that it was an accident but later admitted to intentionally pulling the trigger.

The jury convicted Wafer of murder, manslaughter and a gun-related charge on August 7. He will be eligible for parole after serving the minimum sentence.
