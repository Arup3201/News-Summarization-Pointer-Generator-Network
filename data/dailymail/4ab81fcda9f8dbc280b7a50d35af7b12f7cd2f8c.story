Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took a swipe at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday night, boasting that he 'didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family.'

The two Republican politicians have emerged as early frontrunners for their party's 2016 presidential nomination. And though Walker promised just three days ago that he wouldn't launch attacks against other primary candidates, that pledge seems to have gone quickly out the window.

'I realize that unlike some out there, I didn't inherit fame or fortune from my family,' Walker told a convention of Christian broadcasters in Nashville, Tennessee. 'I got a bunch of things that were a whole lot better than that.'

JAB: Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took a shot at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Monday night, saying he didn't 'inherit' fame and fortune from a family legacy

PLEDGE: Walker promised just three days ago at a National Governors Association meeting that he wouldn't attack fellow Republican presidential hopefuls

Spokespersons for Walker didn't immediately respond to questions about whether that line was meant as a brushback pitch at Bush, but his opponent with the marquee political name si the only one in the likely GOP presidential field who fits the bill.

On Saturday, Walker told reporters at a Washington, D.C. meeting of the National Governors Association that he wouldn't go negative against fellow Republicans during what will likely be a fierce primary season.

'If I (am) a candidate, I’m not going to go out and attack my opponents,' he said, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

'You're not going to hear me say ill will about any of the other candidates,' he said.

But on Monday he drew stark lines of comparison between his hardscrabble origins and Bush's privileged upbringing. 

'My grandparents on my mother's side raised my mother on a farm where they didn't have indoor plumbing until she went off to high school,' he said. 'And on my other side of the family, my grandfather was a machinist ... for about four decades,'

'I got from my parents and my grandparents the belief that if you work hard, if you played by the rules, here in America you can do anything you want,' said to applause.

'That's a pretty powerful belief. And I think we need to remind more of our young people today that we need to have that in America, right?'

Video of his remarks surfaced Tuesday morning courtesy of American Bridge 21st Century, a far-left political action committee that supports likely Democratic nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Bush's famous family, and its thorny political legacy, remains the biggest obstacle in his path to the Whtie House.

'Jeb Bush is asking us to do the impossible,' Bloomberg columnist Margaret Carlson wrote Tuesday: 'forget that he’s the son of one president and the brother of another.'
