England play their first World Cup warm-up friendly on Friday against Peru, a team famous for the sash in their kit, here Sportsmail have ranked the best ten kits with a sash.

It is not uncommon for teams to introduce brand new kits ahead of big tournaments or in tournament years and despite not being in the World Cup Peru have released a new home and away kit.

The home kit is a classic representation of their white shirt with red sash whilst the new away kit is an interesting red kit with red sash.

10. Burnley 1887-8 home

A
 far cry from their claret kit of today, Burnley started with a white and 
blue combo when they were formed in the late 1800s. This edition sees 
white shorts with a singular dark blue sash going across the 
chest.

Different: One of Burnley's earliest kits doesn't look much like what they currently turn out in

9. Southampton 1885-89 home and 2010-11 home

Sometimes it is best to go back to your roots and in the 2010-11 season Southampton did exactly that. The club were celebrating their 125th anniversary and decided to go back to the first kit the club had ever worn. Simple and effective, it is a shame it isn't in use now.

8. RC Lens 2013-14 away

A late entry into the contest, RC Lens ditched their traditional stripes this season and opted for a sash on both kits. The home kit is unchanged otherwise but this white and gold number looks very sophisticated.

7. Inter Milan 1993--94 away

This kit coincided with Dennis Bergkamp's first season at Inter and the club winning the UEFA Cup but that isn't why it was selected. This kit emboldens the famous black and blue of Inter in one sash without looking too big and looks impressive.

6. River Plate 2009 home

One of the most recognisable kits in the world, River's white with red sash is one kit that nearly every football fan would be able to identify. The Argentinian giants' kit is so similar year on year that it is difficult to pick one out. We've gone for the 2009 home kit which embodies everything that is great about this particular shirt.

Famous: The River Plate team in 2009, sporting their famous white strip with red sash

5. Peru 2014 home and away

The cause of this piece finding itself at number five is simple. The home kit is truly excellent, capturing the white with red sash perfectly however the away kit is a little more of a problem and that is the reason this kit isn't higher. Surely the logical thing here would have been to have had a red kit with a white sash? Red on red just doesn't look right.

Good and bad: The Peru home kit (left) is let down by the away kit (right)

4. Sweden Euro 2012 away

The traditional yellow is in the sash and we think that it works really well against the darker section of the kit. International kits have the advantage of no sponsorship and if this had been a club kit there is no doubt it wouldn't have been anywhere near as good.

3. Crystal Palace 1980-83 home

Few clubs embrace the sash quite like Crystal Palace, throughout the club's history there are some excellent examples and narrowing them down was tricky. This effort from the early 1980s is one of their finest and although it may not have been a successful period for the club, the kit was of the highest quality.

Simple: Mike Flanagan of Crystal Palace in action for his team in 1980

2. Crystal Palace 2013-14 away

This kit is very unlucky not to be at the top of this list but it remains a fantastic shirt. Palace are famous for their red and blue but on the black the colours seem enhanced. Crystal Palace's support gained plenty of plaudits this season, their kit also deserves a lot of recognition.

1. Belgium World Cup 2014 away

Belgium's football team have shot to world fame in the past couple of years with a talented young squad and a number of Premier League players in their first team. However their kits for the World Cup are also worth talking about, with the black away kit in particular standing out.

The winner: Belgium's black kit for the 2014 World Cup is one of the best kits around at the moment
