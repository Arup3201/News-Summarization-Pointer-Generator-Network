Jailed: Gary Gilleney, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, first abused a little girl in London in 1985 before going on to molest two more girls in the 1990s

A former soldier let off with just a £100 fine after sexually abusing a child in the 1980s has been jailed for preying on other 'highly vulnerable' children in the 1990s.

Gary Gilleney, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, first abused a little girl in London in 1985.

But under a sentencing regime dating back to the 1950s, he was only convicted of indecent assault and gross indecency and ordered to pay just £100. 

The ex-serviceman was dishonourably discharged from the Army as a result of the conviction and went on to abuse two more 'highly vulnerable' children when he was living in council estates in Manchester the 1990s. 

Now Gilleney has been jailed for six years after admitting six sexual assaults against the two later victims, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.

He was arrested after the offences came to light last year.

One of the newly-discovered victims was just seven when she was abused by Gilleney, Manchester Crown Court heard.

In a statement, she told the court that the ordeal made her feel like she 'never had a proper childhood'.

She added: 'He used to threaten me that if I ever reported the abuse and he went down, he would come and get me after he was released.

'As a child I believed it and I was frightened. I couldn't sleep at nights. I have no self-esteem.

'It's affected my relationships since becoming an adult. I'm shy of my own body and suffer from flashbacks.'

The other victim, who came forward last year, was 13 when he plied her with cannabis and sexually abused her.

One of Gilleney's abuse victims told Manchester Crown Court (above) that she 'doesn't trust anyone any more' and has been 'depressed for years'

In a statement she said she 'doesn't trust anyone any more' and has been 'depressed for years'.

Both women described crying themselves to sleep in the aftermath of their traumatic experiences with Gilleney.

Gilleney's defence barrister said he had been 'damaged' by his own childhood.

He told the court: 'He is genuinely confused and remorseful about what he has done.

'It's not a remorse that comes in floods of tears, but there will follow, one hopes, a period of reflection and introspection.

'This is an unsophisticated person, prone to urges he neither understands nor can control.

'It may be easy to suggest he is simply an evil man and it may be there's some truth in that, but it's more complex than that.'

Judge Martin Rudland, sentencing, told Gilleney: 'You corrupted your victims' formative years.'
