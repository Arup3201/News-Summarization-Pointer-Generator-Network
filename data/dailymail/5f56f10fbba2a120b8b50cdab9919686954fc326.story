East Coast intellectuals: say hello to the new smart kids in town! A new study reveals the most educated town in America is Ann Arbor, Michigan.

The Third Coast city was number one on Wallethub.com's list of the 150 most and least educated metropolitan areas in the country.

So what was the least educated town surveyed by the finance website? All the way down at the bottom, as determined by nine metrics including number of workers in tech and science, quality/size of a city's universities and educational attainment was Beaumont, Texas.

Third coast elite: Ann Arbor, Michigan was determined to be the most educated city in America by a survey from the website Wallet Hub

Raleigh-Durham: Two of the major cities in North Carolina's so-called research triangle came in second and third place 

Behind Ann Arbor on Wallet Hub's list were Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina; Provo, Utah; Provo, Utah; Manchester, New Hampshire. 

And just above Beaumont was Salinas, California and Rockford, Illinois. 

So where were the cities typically thought of as the most high-browed of them all? 

Boston, with its bevy of honored institutions came in at number 10 while nearby New York was all the way back at 51. 

Least educated: According to the study, which used metrics such as number of workers in tech and science, quality/size of a city's universities and educational attainment, the least educated of America's 150 largest cities is Beaumont, Texas

While the results include cities from every part of the country, as well as Alaska and Hawaii, most well-rated cities were unsurprisingly concentrated in the eastern US. 

To illustrate exactly how the cities and their educational performance are spread out, Wallet Hub created an interactive map of its results.

How did your city do?
