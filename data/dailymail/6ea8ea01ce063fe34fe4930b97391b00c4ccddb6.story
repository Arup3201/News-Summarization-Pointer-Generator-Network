Covered: Female teachers at Al-Madinah School, pictured, have been ordered to cover their heads with Islamic scarves during school hours even if they are not Muslim

Inspectors are to be sent ‘within days’ to a Muslim free school where girls are segregated from boys and non-Muslim female staff forced to wear hijabs.

Michael Gove has ordered Ofsted to immediately investigate Al-Madinah School amid reports lessons are being replaced by prayers.

The Derby school, which opened last year, was due to have its first inspection later this term but the quality of teaching and leadership will now be scrutinised as a matter of urgency.

Possible outcomes include it being given the lowest possible rating of ‘inadequate’ and placed in special measures.

The Secretary of State acted as critics warned similar practices could spread to other free schools, which are state funded but operate outside local authority control.

The revelations have been embarrassing for Mr Gove, who introduced the schools in 2010 to raise the standard of education.

Insiders at Al-Madinah School say it has become increasingly religious since opening. Teachers claim this has led to children’s education suffering.

Girls allegedly have to sit at the back of the class and give up their place at the front of queues to boys.

Stringed instruments, singing, reading fairy tales and even using the word ‘pig’ are banned, according to staff, who say they are also obliged to wear headscarves.

Former headteacher Andrew Cutts-McKay resigned last month, two months after his deputy, Suzanne Southerland.

Sources claimed they had been ‘bullied’ out of their jobs over concerns about hardline policies. The school denies the claims.

Pressure groups and education experts said failure to take action would promote segregation – and encourage other Islamic free schools to follow Al-Madinah’s extreme model.

They also warned that the way female pupils were being treated could end up damaging their sense of self-worth.

Margaret Morrissey, from pressure group Parents Outloud, said: ‘This is going to make life extremely difficult for female pupils.

‘All the time they are being told they are second-class citizens. It is promoting a segregated society.

‘Children have to understand how to live in our society. If they’re not getting that at school then they’re not getting it anywhere.’

Chris McGovern, from the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘This is a very difficult situation. We live in a multicultural society and a consequence of that is you have multicultural practices. But the buck stops with Michael Gove.’

Under scrutiny: The nation's first Muslim free school has caused controversy with its hard-line rules

And Alasdair Smith, national secretary of the Anti Academies Alliance, said: ‘I can’t understand why there has been the argument that deregulation [of free schools] is a good idea.

‘Some regulation is important because otherwise you get extremism in schools.’

He added: ‘We are creating an education system that is separating sections of society.

‘For the last 40 or 50 years people were brought together by being educated side by side. Now Mr Gove is allowing space for confusion and bigotry.’

A message posted on the school’s website by interim principal Stuart Wilson said: ‘There are a number of rumours circulating that are worrying parents. The school is not going to shut down.’

But a Department for Education spokesman said: ‘These allegations are very worrying. The DfE will not hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to prevent religious intolerance or any breaking of the rules for free schools.’
