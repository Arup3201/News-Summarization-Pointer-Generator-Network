A farmer who claimed he could not walk 30ft and illegally pocketed £100,000 in benefits was caught on camera herding cattle and climbing fences.

David Millward, 55, was secretly filmed by the Department of Work and Pensions carrying bags of animal feed around the field he rented in Coven, Staffordshire.

Footage showed him climbing over a fence, filling feeding trays and loading cattle into his trailer all without walking aids and displaying only a slight limp.

Caught on camera: David Millward was secretly filmed carrying bags of animal feed after he pocketed £100,000 of benefits, claiming he could not walk 30ft

Millward illegally pocketed £75,532 in income support and £24,692 in disability living allowance by the time the scam was uncovered last year following a probe launched after a tip off in 2010. The secret video was shot that summer.

Millward pleaded guilty to two offences of cheating at Wolverhampton Crown Court today.

Inquiries revealed that he had been 
working as a self-employed livestock trader and had been involved in the
business since 1999.

But 
the married man from Breword, Staffordshire failed to mention this when 
he successfully applied for income support and disability allowance in 
2003.

Claimed he could not walk: Millward pleaded guilty to two offences of cheating after he was filmed climbing fences and it was revealed he worked as a self-employed livestock trader

Unaided: Millward displayed only a slight limp but used no walking aids as he fed cattle despite claiming he could not walk

He admitted illegally claiming income support and illegally collecting disability living allowance.

He previously denied the offences. Mr Stephen Blower, defending, asked for a pre-sentence and medical report to be drawn up. 

Judge Amjad Nawaz remanded Millward until February 4 with bail on condition he co-operates with doctors, and added that due to the sums involved a custodial sentence is probable.

The case comes as benefit cheat Alan Lawson, 58, was jailed for eight months after he caught working as a council fitness instructor and teaching people how to lift weights despite his claims he was unemployed and could barely walk.

Lawson, 58, raked in nearly £90,000 over more than eight years claiming he suffered severe back and leg pain.

Pleaded guilty: Millward admitted illegally claiming income support and illegally collecting disability living allowance and was remanded until February 4
