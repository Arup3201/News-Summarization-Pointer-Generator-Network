The entire field is separated by just six shots heading into the final round of the Madeira Islands Open after the tournament was reduced to 36 holes for the second year in succession.

The tournament had been cut to three rounds after winds gusting up to 47mph meant no play was possible on Thursday, while further strong winds on Friday caused a delay of almost two hours before rain ended play early.

Half of the field had yet to complete their rounds when play was abandoned for the day at 6pm and more rain which flooded the course caused further disruption on Saturday.

Heavy rain has forced organisers to reduce the Madeira Islands Open to 36 holes

The European Tour event was reduced for the second year in a row after strong winds and heavy rain

With yet more bad weather forecast for Sunday the decision was taken to make it a 36-hole event, with the top 65 and ties due to play the final round in a shotgun start at 8am.

Denmark's JB Hansen held the clubhouse lead on four under par, one shot ahead of a group of eight players including England's Andrew Marshall and Scotland's Peter Whiteford.

'I'm quite happy, played nicely and left a few out there to be honest, which is nice to say considering I was probably the worst golfer on the European Tour last year!' Whiteford said.

'It's been blowing a hurricane back home so it's kind of what I've been practising in anyway. It's the first time I've been on a golf course and enjoyed it for maybe a year so I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

'I feel very refreshed after taking a little break from the game. The driver is a lot better and that was the thing that was killing me last year, but you work twice as hard when you're playing badly and I was doing more than I should have been doing, working on the wrong things.

'It feels better, the time away helped to refresh the brain a little bit and if I enjoy it I'll play all right. I don't care how I do at the moment as long as I enjoy it.

'It's a major for us on the Challenge Tour, the biggest one of the year so with me certainly, being selfish, I definitely want to get the second round in so I can get a pay cheque and some money onto the rankings.

'After just one round it's going to be an absolute rat race with a huge number of people on the same scores. It'll be a shotgun start so it's not like you'll be under the cosh coming down the stretch because you'll never know where the scores will come from.'
