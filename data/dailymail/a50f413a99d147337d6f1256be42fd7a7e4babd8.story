A dental receptionist and her boss brought a patient 'back from the dead' after he had a heart attack in the waiting room.

Charlotte Anderson-Hughes, 23, and dentist Chandra Metha used a defibrillator on Simon Walker, 53, from Hyde, after he collapsed in Maggie Jackson’s Independent Dental Hygiene Service, in Tameside, Greater Manchester.

After realising an ambulance was not going to arrive in time to save him, they began CPR and used a defibrillator to shock his heart.

Simon Walker, 53, had a heart attack and collapsed in a dentist's waiting room on Monday

Ms Anderson-Hughes said: ‘He collapsed on the floor. Chandra shouted for me and put him in the recovery position but it wasn't working - it was all so fast.

‘I was looking at him and he was clinically dead. He was going blue and his eyes were open. It was awful.

‘We got the defibrillator and used it twice. It was only then that we got a pulse. You just say to yourself, “keep going, keep going or he's going to die”.

‘We do the first aid training but never think you'll have to use it.’

Mr Walker was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital by paramedics after falling ill on Monday and is on his way to recovery.

He sent a text to staff at the practice saying he was 'eternally grateful' for the help.

Mr Walker (pictured with his daughter, Charlotte Walker, in hospital) says he is eternally grateful to the people who saved his life and that he is planning to raise money for more defibrillators to be placed around his town

Speaking from his hospital bed, he said: ‘I owe Charlotte and Chandra big time.

‘How I can pay them back for what they did is impossible to say. I want to do something for them but I don't know what yet - I'll probably raise some money for more defibrillators around the town.

‘My family were at my bedside yesterday and today they are just over the moon that I'm still here. I only walked to the dentist because I thought the exercise wouldn't do me any harm.’

Maggie Jackson, who runs the practice, is friends with Mr Walker and said her staff were ‘incredible’.

She said: ‘He's a friend of mine - so to have my staff save him was amazing.

‘He was dead. He was clinically dead. Chandra did 15 minutes of chest compressions before they used the defibrillator - he's very fit.

‘Thank God he was there. I'm so relieved my staff did what they did. I'm so proud. They were incredible.’

General Dental Council guidelines say all dentists should have a defibrillator on site, but it is not a legal requirement.

Ms Jackson said: ‘Saving somebody's life is priceless. Defibrillators are expensive equipment at around £1,000, but what's that for a life?

‘It's without a doubt the best £1,000 I've ever spent. He was dead yesterday and alive today.

‘If he'd collapsed 100 yards away that would've been it for him.’
