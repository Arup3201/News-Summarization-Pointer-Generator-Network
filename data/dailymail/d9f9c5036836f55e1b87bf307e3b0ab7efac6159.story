Professor Stephen Hawking has sparked new health fears by pulling out of a trip to Ecuador.

The renowned cosmologist was due to speak at a conference in the Pacific city of Guayaquil on February 6.

He informed authorities he would not be able to attend over the weekend, citing health reasons.

The 71-year-old, diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21, missed two birthday parties last year because of health problems.

A spokesman said last night he had suspended his trip to Ecuador on medical advice but insisted it was nothing 'too serious.'

Hawking said he expects to visit 'in the near future,' according to reports.

The physicist had been invited by the Ecuadorian Vice President Lenin Moreno during a visit he paid to London in August 2012.

Moreno, currently in charge of the Presidency, wished him a speedy recovery.

Many experts say Professor Hawking has defied medical science by reaching the age of 71 as his degenerative illness usually proves fatal within five years of diagnosis.

Professor Hawking has become as much a celebrity as he is a scientist, 
appearing on TV cartoon The Simpsons, starring in Star Trek and 
providing narration for a British Telecom commercial that was later 
sampled on a Pink Floyd album.

He also starred in the 2012 Paralympic opening ceremony, and in a TV ad for an insurance firm.

However, his condition worsened recently, causing him to struggle to communicate.

The world renowned physicist has for the past ten years composed his sentences one letter at a time using a twitch of his cheek to stop a cursor as it moves across an on-screen keyboard.

Professor Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease at the age of 21.

Motor neurone disease (MND) attacks the nervous system and leaves 
muscles damaged, causing loss of mobility and difficulties with speech, 
swallowing and breathing.

One in 50,000 people are diagnosed 
with the disease each year and sufferers usually die within five years 
of its onset.

Its cause is a mystery but some experts believe an 
individual's damaged genetic make-up might be a contributory factor.

There is currently no cure.

Stephen Hawking, who is confined to a wheelchair, is the world's 
best known sufferer of the most common form of motor neurone fisease - 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

He
is an exceptional case, having survived for more than 40 years, despite
doctors giving him just two years to live when first diagnosed.

After he painstakingly crafts his sentences one word at a time, a computer attached to his wheelchair reads them out in the distinctive metallic voice for which he is known.

But recently the disease from which he suffers has made his cheek twitch more difficult to control, significantly slowing the rate at which one of the world's sharpest minds is able to communicate with the outside world.

To help, computer hardware firm Intel recently announced it was giving him a device it hopes will help the professor compose up to ten words a minute.

The world-renowned physicist has used a computerised speech generator for years, composing sentences one letter at a time using a twitch of his cheek.

His worsening physical condition has left him able to manage around just one word a minute.

Intel began working on Professor Hawking's new device in 2011, after he asked for help from Intel co-founder Gordon Moore - the man behind computing's famous 'Moore's Law', which says processing power will double every two years.

The new system uses facial recognition technology to recognise not only Hawking's cheek movements, but also twitches from his mouth and eyebrows to send words to a new speech machine.

Justin Rattner, Intel’s chief technology officer, told Scientific American magazine that the upgrade comes after technology finally caught up with the complicated concepts Hawking wanted to express.

'We’ve built a new, character-driven interface in modern terms that includes a better word predictor,' he said.

'Up to now, [previous] technologies didn’t work well enough to satisfy someone like Stephen, who wants to produce a lot of information.'

The new technology offers the 
professor the opportunity to use two different signals to express 
himself, which means he could even communicate using Morse code which, 
said Mr Rattner, 'would be a great improvement'.

Professor
Hawking took to his personal blog to tell how grateful he is for the 
new technology that allows him to continue to speak.

'One’s voice is very important,' he wrote. 'If you have a slurred voice, people are likely to treat you as mentally deficient.

'This [computer] synthesiser is by far the best I have heard, because it varies the intonation, and doesn’t speak like a Dalek.

'The only trouble is that it gives me an American accent.'

Intel has worked with Professor Hawking since the late Nineties to provide the technology he needs to express himself.

In the 1970s, already confined to a wheelchair, he produced a stream of first class research, including probably his most important contribution to cosmology.

This was the discovery of Hawking radiation, which allows a black hole to leak energy and gradually fade away to nothing.

By applying quantum mechanics to black holes, he had taken the first steps to combining quantum theory and general relativity. One describes the universe at the sub-atomic level, and the other at very large scales.

Bringing the two theories together is one of the great unfulfilled goals of modern physics.

In the 1980s, Prof Hawking and Professor Jim Hartle, from the University of California at Santa Barbara, proposed a model of the universe which had no boundaries in space or time.

The concept was described in A Brief History Of Time, which sold 25 million copies worldwide.
