Equality: Ben Bradshaw said the Anglican talent pool is drying up while the Church has a high number of women who would make 'first-class' bishops

The Church of England is running out of male priests good enough to be bishops, a senior Labour MP said yesterday.

Former Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw said the Anglican talent pool is drying up while the Church has a high number of women who would make first-class bishops.

He spoke during a Westminster debate in which MPs warned the Church of England not to delay any longer in its progress towards allowing women to be consecrated as bishops.

Mr Bradshaw said in a Westminster Hall debate that there were rumours that the Church had run out of credible candidates worthy of promotion.

He said: ‘We have a great bunch of bishops and they do a fantastic job in the House of Lords, but one does hear sort of rumours that we are getting to the end of our talent pool when it comes to male suffragans who we can promote up into diocesan bishops.

‘That is certainly not the case when it comes to our senior women clergy. And there are many senior women clergy, who I can imagine, would make absolutely first-class bishops.’

The CofE has been under political pressure to speed the appointment of women bishops since the autumn of 2012, when conservative evangelicals in its parliament, the General Synod, succeeding in wrecking Church laws to remove the block on the promotion of women.

David Cameron said at the time that the Church needed a ‘sharp prod’ and other MPs threatened that Parliament would force the CofE’s hand.

A speed-up of Church legislation now means the first women bishops may be appointed by the end of the years.

Labour Shadow Culture Minister Helen Goodman told MPs in the debate yesterday that Parliament would not settle for an ‘indefinite delay’ on the consecration of female bishops.

Labour Shadow Culture Minister Helen Goodman said the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby had 'managed this situation quite brilliantly and has shown a very deft touch'

She told Tory Sir Tony Baldry, who speaks for the Church in the Commons, said: ‘We want to offer our full support to you, as second Church Estates Commissioner, in the message that Parliament is not content to see indefinite delay.

‘We are 100 per cent behind you in giving that message to the Church.’

Miss Goodman added that the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby had ‘managed this situation quite brilliantly and has shown a very deft touch.’

Sir Tony warned MPs that although the Synod was set to approve women bishops, there would need to be primary legislation in Parliament before they could legally be appointed.
