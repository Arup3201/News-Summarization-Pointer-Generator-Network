German detectives have arrested a man suspected of spying for the United States in what could prove the 'biggest scandal involving a German-American double agent since the Second World War'.

The 31-year-old German citizen was being questioned today on suspicion of snooping on Germany's parliamentary inquiry into the NSA affair.

According to one German newspaper, he was first arrested amid suspicions he tried to make contact with Russian intelligence, only to confess he was in fact spying for the Americans.

Double agent: German authorities would not go into any details as to the identity of the man except that he worked for the BND intelligence service, Germany's equivalent to MI6 (pictured: radomes that contain radar antennas stand at an operating facility of the BND, for whom the suspect works)

'The matter is serious, that is very clear,' a German government spokesman told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.

German authorities would not go into any details as to the identity of the man except that he worked for the BND intelligence service, Germany's equivalent to MI6.

However, German media launched into a fever of speculation today as to who he was and what he was allegedly doing.

Bild reported that the suspected mole was a double agent for the Americans for two years and passed them 218 secret documents in exchange for €25,000, including at least three documents related to the Bundestag NSA enquiry.

The man was said to have met his contact in Austria and passed him the documents on a USB stick, the paper added.

Confession: The man has admitted passing to an American contact details about a special German parliamentary committee set up to investigate the spying revelations made by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden

Germany summoned the U.S. ambassador 
in Berlin on Friday following the arrest, heightening friction between 
the two countries over alleged U.S. eavesdropping in Germany.

Ambassador
 John B. Emerson was called in 'in connection with an investigation by 
the federal prosecutor', the German Foreign Ministry said in a 
statement.

The U.S. envoy 'was asked to help in the swift clarification' of the case, it added.

The arrested man’s exact position in the BND remains shrouded in mystery.

Spiegel suggested he worked in the 
mail room, while Die Welt newspaper reported he had worked in close 
contact with the head of the intelligence service, Gerhard Schindler.

Another paper said the affair will be the 'the biggest scandal involving a German-American double agent since the war'.

The
 affair risks further straining ties with Washington which were damaged 
by revelations last year of mass surveillance of German citizens by the 
U.S. National Security Agency, which included monitoring Chancellor 
Angela Merkel's mobile phone.

The man has admitted passing to an American contact details about a special German parliamentary committee set up to investigate the spying revelations made by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, two politicians, who asked to remain anonymous, said.

Both lawmakers are members of the nine-person parliamentary control committee, whose meetings are confidential, and which is in charge of monitoring German intelligence.

The parliamentary committee investigating the NSA affair also holds some confidential meetings.

'This
 was a man who had no direct contact with the investigative committee...
 He was not a top agent,' said one of the politicians.

The suspect had offered his services to the 
United States voluntarily, the source added.

Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert said: 'We don't take the matter of spying for foreign intelligence agencies lightly'.

When
 asked whether Merkel had discussed it with President Barack Obama 
during a phone conversation on Thursday night, he answered they had 
talked about foreign affairs.

The United States embassy in Berlin, the State Department in Washington and the White House all declined to comment.

Germany
 is particularly sensitive about surveillance because of abuses by the 
East German Stasi secret police and the Nazis. Berlin has demanded that 
Washington agree to a 'no-spy' agreement with its close ally, but the United 
States has been unwilling.
