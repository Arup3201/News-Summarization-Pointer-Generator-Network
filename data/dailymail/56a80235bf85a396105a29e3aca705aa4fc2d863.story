Beauty pageant judge Charlotte Holl groomed and sexually assaulted a young girl, plying her with cigarettes and alcohol

A female beauty pageant judge groomed and sexually assaulted a young girl, plying her with cigarettes and alcohol.

Charlotte Holl, 25, sent 1,200 texts and social media messages to her victim  - who is under 13-years-old - and dreamed of living with her in Florida, Ipswich Crown Court heard.

Holl, of Newmarket, Suffolk, touched the girl’s inner leg over her clothes, kissed her and put her arm around her waist.

But Holl has been spared jail - and was given an 18-month jail sentence suspended for two years after she admitted four sexual assaults on a girl and being an adult who met a girl following grooming.

Robert Sadd, prosecuting, told her sentencing hearing that Holl had no previous convictions.

Duncan O’Donnell, defending, said she had been 'vulnerable and immature'.

He said smitten Holl was 'ashamed' of her actions.

Mr O’Donnell told Ipswich Crown Court: 'Throughout these proceedings she has indicated she has been horrified by what she did.

'She acknowledged in (police) interview what she did.

'These are offences that are never going to happen again.

He added: 'She has pleaded guilty and indicated her full horror over what she has done.

'While the custody threshold has been passed in the circumstances of this offending behaviour it is a custodial sentence that falls within the bracket that could be suspended.'

Sentencing Holl, Judge Rupert Overbury said she was vulnerable.

But he told her: 'It’s plain to me, as it was to the probation service, you certainly did have the intention of going further than kissing.'

Judge Overbury said Holl had carried out the attacks for her own 'sexual satisfaction'.

Messages between the two indicated Holl was thinking of living with the girl and taking her to Florida, the court heard.

She groomed the child and gave her cigarettes and alcohol, the case heard.

As well as her suspended sentence Holl was ordered to do 300 hours unpaid work within 12 months.

She was also given a two-year supervision requirement.

Judge Overbury also made Holl the subject of Sexual Offences Prevention Order 'to protect young members of our society from you committing further offences'.

The restrictions include no unsupervised contact with a child under 16 and ban Holl attending any pageant nationally where girls under 16 are performing.

She was also made subject to the notification requirements of the Sexual Offence Act for five years.
