The world of fashion can be a strange 
and unusual place.

But a new style competition at a school in Japan has taken things to a whole new gothic-charged level.

Inspired
by the spooky fantasy world conjured up in his new film Frankenweenie, children at the Tokyo Mode Gakuen Fashion School were challenged to create a monochrome costume befitting of a Tim Burton epic - and the director even turned up to be a judge.

Accompanied by their dogs (who also dressed up for the occasion), the children involved in the Frankenweenie Fashion Competition wore their own designs, including gothic net skirts, bat-printed cone dresses, Cruella de Vil-esqe wigs and paw-print creations.

The mini fashionistas based their designs on characters from Burton's latest black and white animated film for children, Frankenweenie.

Frankenweenie is shot in monochrome in homage to the old horror films the director used to watch as a boy.

It tells the story of Victor, a lonely child growing up in the small town of New Holland, with only his home movie-making and his beloved dog, Sparky, to keep him company. After a ball-chasing incident, Sparky is run over - until Victor decides to bring him back to life.

The mini models strutted down the catwalk with actual dogs, stuffed toy dogs dalmatian prints, and stuffed white bones attached to monochrome tops, dresses and skirt, while Helena Bonham Carter lookalikes opted for basque dresses befitting of a liquorice all sorts.
