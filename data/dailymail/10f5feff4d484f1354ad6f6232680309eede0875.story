Angry farmers have hit out against European Union rules which they claim will force cows to wear nappies.

Under an EU nitrates directive, the use of fertilisers is being prohibited on hillsides with gradients of more than 15 per cent.

The Bavarian farmers’ association fears the new rules effectively ban them from grazing cows on the slopes - because their cow pats might be construed as fertilising.

Under EU rules, the use of fertilisers is being prohibited on hillsides with gradients of more than 15 per cent and farmers fear it effectively bans them from grazing cows because cow pats might be construed as fertilising

One German farmer, Johann Huber, whose family has farmed on the mountain slopes of Gmund am Tegernsee in the Alps for more than 400 years, has created homemade nappies in an unusual protest at the new rules.

He had made them from large pieces of cloth so his 18 cows don’t fall foul of the fertiliser ban.

Mr Huber said: ‘We have no standard nappies, they have not been developed commercially yet.’

Farmers in breach of the nitrates directive could lose their EU agricultural subsidies, worth thousands of Euros each year - while they fear that complying with the restrictions could also force many out of business.

Anton Kreitmair, farmers’ association president in Upper Bavaria, said: ‘We demand that the ban is stopped in Germany. In Bavaria no fertilisation would be possible on half the cultivated land and restrictions would be needed on cows grazing in Alpine pastures.’

The European Union says its nitrates directive is necessary ‘to avoid leaching of nitrates and water pollution’.

But a spokesman for the European Commission denied the ban would affect cattle.

He said: ‘The directive does not foresee a ban on grazing animals on sloping land.’

The spokesman added that he believed it ‘unlikely’ that Germany would propose its own ban on grazing animals on sloping land.
