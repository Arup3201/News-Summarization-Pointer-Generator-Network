David Beckham is facing a huge backlash against his plans for a 25,000-seater soccer stadium in Miami.

An alliance of shipping businesses and a billionaire car dealer have launched a campaign protesting the football star’s venue, which would be situated at the Port of Miami in Florida, and include a restaurant and a nightclub.

The consortium, which publicized their opposition in a full-page advertisement in two major newspapers yesterday, said if given the green light, it would threaten the city's plans to capitalize on the expansion of the Panama Canal.

Under fire: David Beckham's plans for a 25,000-seater stadium in Miami are facing powerful opposition

Open letter: The Miami Seaport Alliance took out full-page ads in the Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald (pictured) on Monday explaining their opposition to Beckham's plans for a 25,000-seater stadium in Miami

The as-yet-unnamed stadium would be paid for by Beckham and his partners, and the venue would host 17 Major League Soccer games, as well as additional post-season games, soccer friendlies, and other entertainment.

In the Miami Herald and its sister Spanish-language paper, El Nuevo Herald, the Miami Seaport Alliance told Beckham: 'We cannot jeopardize well-paying jobs, like crane operators, longshore workers, and mechanics, for low-paying stadium jobs, such as concession sales.'

The group is being led by John Fox, who has retired as Royal Caribbean Cruise Line's head of governmental affairs.

The group includes billionaire car dealer Norman Braman, the one-time owner of Philadelphia Eagles, in addition to two chapters of the International Longshoremen's Association and two stevedore companies, whose workers load and unload ships.

‘There are plenty of other places for the stadium to be,’ Braman said.

Prime real estate: Port of Miami is one of the world's busiest ports

The English former football player last month unveiled detailed plans for a 25,000-seat waterfront stadium
 on the island port with sweeping views of downtown Miami.

Development of the 36-acre space would cost about $200m and include shops, hotels and offices connected to the mainland by a pedestrian bridge.

The port is one of four potential areas for the new stadium, which Beckham's team say will create a new destination for Miami residents.

Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said: ‘There’s nothing concrete, there's no recommendation pending.’ 

The port's master plan calls for the development of more than 7m-sq-ft of convention, hotel and office space on the same site.

Before Monday's ad, only Royal Caribbean, which is headquartered at the port, has come out publicly against Beckham's plan.

Neisen Kasdin, an attorney for Akerman Senterfitt and adviser for the Beckham group, said: ‘The plan doesn't interfere with port operations.

‘It will likely generate more revenue for the port in the shorter term than other concepts that have been discussed.’

Yet a growing list of opponents say a stadium would jeopardise Miami's aspiration of becoming a more attractive choice for global shippers looking to distribute goods to the US market.

Neither Braman nor Fox would say who paid for the two ads in Monday's papers, worth nearly $25,000.

‘I haven't given any dollars yet but I would if asked,’ Braman added.
