Denise Rich, the wealthy socialite and former wife of pardoned billionaire trader Marc Rich, has given up her U.S. citizenship - and, with it, much of her U.S. tax bill.

Rich, 68, a Grammy-nominated songwriter, top Democratic donor and glamorous figure in European royalty circles, renounced her American passport in November, according to her lawyer.

Her maiden name, Denise Eisenberg, appeared in the Federal Register on April 30 in a quarterly list of Americans who renounced their U.S. citizenship and permanent residents who handed in their green cards.

Wealthy: Denise Rich, a songwriter who was married to pardoned billionaire trader Marc Rich, has denounced her American citizenship and will save millions in U.S. tax bills

By dumping her U.S. passport, Rich, who was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, likely will save tens of millions of dollars or more in U.S. taxes over the long haul, tax lawyers say.

She also has Austrian citizenship through her
deceased father, said Michael Heidt, a lawyer in Hollywood, Florida, 
who represented her in a recent lawsuit. She plans to live in London.

Rich, who wrote songs recorded by Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige and Jessica Simpson, is the latest bold-faced name to join a wave of wealthy people renouncing their American citizenship.

Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin gave up his U.S. passport to become a citizen of Singapore, an offshore tax haven, before the company's initial public offering in May.

Moving on: Her lawyer said she gave up her U.S. passport to be closer to her family and partner, Peter Cervinka

Nearly 1,800 citizens and permanent 
residents, a record since data was first compiled in 1998, expatriated 
last year, according to government figures.

Heidt said Rich had dumped her U.S. 
passport "so that she can be closer to her family and to Peter Cervinka,
her long-time partner."

On leaving the U.S., Rich will have to pay 'exit tax' on property she owns across the world.

But, as an Austrian citizen, she will get tax breaks. While Austria generally taxes its citizens on their worldwide income, it has generous breaks for citizens who spend half the year abroad.

Rich will fulfill this criterion as her main residence will be in London, her lawyer said.

But while in the United Kingdom, she can claim 'non-domiciled' status, the coveted tax status of the international private jet set.

Being a 'non-dom' means you do not have to pay income and capital gains tax on earnings made outside the United Kingdom.

Those earnings will only be taxed if they are remitted to the U.K.

This is at odds with the U.S. which generally taxes its citizens on their worldwide income.

Rich's two daughters live in London; Cervinka, a wealthy property developer, is an Austrian national. Rich plans to make London her main residence and does not intend to acquire other passports, Heidt said.

Rich's ex-husband, commodities trader Marc Rich, fled the United States in 1983 when indicted on charges of tax evasion, fraud, racketeering and illegal trading of oil with Iran. They divorced in 1996.

Marc Rich received a presidential pardon in 2001 on President Bill Clinton's last day in office.

Federal
prosecutors and Congress investigated the pardon, and in 2002 a House 
of Representatives committee concluded Denise Rich had swayed the action
through donations to the Clinton library and campaign.

Dubbed "Lady Gatsby" by Yachting 
magazine, Rich owns multiple properties, including a mansion in Aspen, 
Colorado.

She is a frequent habitue of Cannes, Monte Carlo and St. 
Tropez with celebrities and singers aboard her 157-foot yacht, Lady Joy.

Rich will escape future U.S. taxes but possibly not all current ones. In 2008, Congress imposed an 
expatriation tax on persons with a net worth of more than $2 million who
dump their U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.

Privilege: A committee found Denise Rich had swayed the pardon with donations to the Clinton campaign

Under the law, those people owe an "exit tax" on their worldwide property, computed at a fair market value the day before they leave.

But tax lawyers say the tax can be reduced or avoided by structuring asset holdings through foreign annuities.

While Austria, like the United States, generally taxes its citizens on their worldwide income, it has generous tax breaks for citizens who spend half the year abroad.

In January, Rich put her 5th Avenue 
penthouse in New York on the market for $65 million, according to the 
listing agent, The Corcoran Group.

Career: Rich wrote songs recorded by Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige and Jessica Simpson

Former flame: She was married to trader Marc Rich until 1996. He is worth around $1 billion

New York property records show Rich acquired a 100 percent stake in the apartment, described by Corcoran as "the epitome of luxury and grandeur," for $200,000 in 2006.

Bonnie Evans, the Corcoran broker for the property, declined to discuss details.

The recent lawsuit against Rich was filed on behalf of Lee Goldberg, the former protector of a Cook Islands trust of which Rich is a beneficiary, in February. The case was dismissed in April, court records show.

The Cook Islands, a South Pacific tax haven, offers Swiss-style secrecy for wealthy investors.

Life of luxury: In January, she put her 5th Avenue penthouse in New York on the market for $65 million

Opulent: The 12,000 square feet property has seven bedrooms and eleven bathrooms

High life: The property, which also has a recording studio, has a stunning view over Central Park

The lawsuit accused Rich and Richard Kilstock, a British real estate entrepreneur who is married to Rich's daughter Daniella, of "transferring, moving or secreting trust assets, in violation of the trust's guidelines and without the knowledge or permission of Goldberg."

Rich and Kilstock denied the charges and accused Goldberg of altering trust documents, court filings show.

Both Goldberg and his attorney, Donald Thomas, declined to discuss the case. Rich recently dismissed Goldberg, one of her long-time lawyers, as protector of the trust.

Heidt, who also represents Kilstock in the case, declined to discuss the lawsuit. Kilstock did not return calls requesting comment.
