Apple may have given the world a glimpse of the iWatch - or played an elaborate practical joke on millions of iFans.

The firm's latest iPhone advert shows a user listening to an iPhone, but with a mysterious gadget on his wrist.

Although the screen cannot be clearly seen, many online users have 
speculated that the gadget is in fact Apple's much rumoured iWatch.

Is this the iWatch? Apple's latest TV commercial shows and iPhone user wearing a mysterious gadget on his wrist - and it resembles artist's impressions of what a much-rumoured iWatch could look like

The user is shown drumming on a table, and the gadget appears to have rounded edges similar to tan Apple product, and a mysterious circle on its 'face'

The so-called 'iWatch' is set to take on Google's Glass eyewear in the wearable computer market.

The speculation has let to hundreds of Apple fans creating their own mockups of an iWatch.

However, some onlookers have also pointed out that the device looks uncannily like Apple's current iPod Shuffle, which has wrist mounts available for it it turning into a basic watch.

The advert comes just weeks before Apple's WWDC event for developers, where it tradictionally reveals new products.

This year it is expected to reveal a major overhaul of its iOS software, which reports claim will replace the current software with a 'flat' design being overseen by the Sir Jonathan Ive, the firm's London-born design boss.

However, it has also been rumoured the firm could also reveal details of its much rumoured TV service - and even unveil the iWatch.

Recently MacUser magazine revealed its idea for the watch, shown below.

'We worked with 3D artist Martin Hajek to conceive, design and construct a plausible Apple watch,' said Adam Banks, Editor in Chief of MacUser magazine.

'The brief we gave ourselves was that it had to feel like something we could actually imagine buying from an Apple Store.

'We came to the conclusion that 
Apple’s most likely play would be to keep its watch as conventional as 
possible, with the feel of something classic rather than excitably 
innovative.'

This ruled out the ‘slap wrap’ design featured in a recent Apple patent, which harked back to the 1980s toy craze.

'We came back to the classic leather 
strap, something Apple could make well – like the iPad Smart Cover, for 
example – but for which third parties could also offer alternatives.

MacUser magazine's vision of the iWatch: It believes the watch would look similar to the iPhone 5, and work with Apple's handset to display information

The iWatch will have a leather strap rather than the 'slap wrap' band recently revealed in a patent application, the magazine reveals

The magazine also believe the watch will look similar to Apple's current iPhone 5 design.

'We based the body of the watch on the iPhone 5, because its jewel-like bevelled finish seemed ideally suited to a device in the form of jewellery,' said Banks.

The team believe a first generation iWatch may not include a webcam, and will rely on an iPhone for its data connection.

It also believes Apple may come up with a clever solution for conserving battery life.

'Apple would surely find a nice solution: it has numerous patents on motion and position sensors, and could come up with a way of guessing when you're going to look at your watch.

'A simpler solution might be to formalise the wrist-twisting gesture that typically accompanies checking the time.'

However, Banks also admits the magazine has no insider knowledge.

'Anyone who tells you they know what Apple is planning doesn’t know Apple’s planning.

'But anyone can guess, and those who know Apple best can guess better.'

Figure one of Apple's U.S. Patent Application no. 20130044215: It describes a 'wearable accessory device' which mounts a touchscreen on the user's wrist using the same technology as a slap wrap

Earlier this year it was revealed Apple had patented several technology that could be used in a watch.

U.S. patent application no. 
20130044215, filed by Apple in August 2011, specifies the technology for
a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display'.

It
describes: 'A wearable video device ... comprising: a flexible 
substrate having a flat state and a curled state [and] a flexible 
display disposed upon a first surface of the flexible substrate.'

The
wrist band type device described in the patent application would attach
to users' wrists using the same kind of mechanism as a slap wrap toy.

Unexpected: The design, published for the first time today, shows that even without Steve Jobs at the helm, Apple still has the ability to surprise

Popular among youngsters in the late 
Eighties and early-Nineties, slap wraps are bracelets consisting of 
layered, flexible stainless steel bi-stable spring bands sealed within a
fabric or plastic cover.

The
bracelet can be straightened out, causing tension within the springy 
metal bands, then slapped against a wearer's forearm, causing the bands 
to spring back into a curve that wraps around the wrist.

As
expected by many Apple observers, the iWatch-like device described in 
the '44215 patent app would be 'configured to display information 
wirelessly transmitted from a portable electronic device', most likely 
an iPhone.

As well as the 
touch-sensitive display, the application says it would include 'a 
communication link, allowing two-way communication between the slap 
bracelet and the portable electronic device.'

'Information
generated on either device can be displayed on either the host device 
display or the flexible display,' the application says.

Some of the most interesting innovations described by the application involve the manner in which the device could be powered.

'The
battery can take many forms,' it suggests. 'For example, the battery 
can be distributed in nature by which it is meant that portions of the 
battery can be placed in disparate locations in the accessory.'

It
also describes methods in which the battery life could be extended, 
including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory 
device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some 
wristwatches.'

'An 
accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly 
benefit from this sort of power generation, and could lengthen the 
amount of time between charging,' the application says.
