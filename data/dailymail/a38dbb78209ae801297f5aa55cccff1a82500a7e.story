Students at a northern California high school are petitioning for a security guard fired for beating a disabled student to get his job back, as a second video showing him kicking the teen has emerged.

Security guard Marchell Mitchell, 23, was dismissed by Oakland High School officials on May 19 after he was caught on video beating Francisco Martinez because the student argued with him, slapped his hand and spit on him.

However, classmates of the 17-year-old 
victim are now calling for the security guard to be reinstated, claiming
 Martinez is a troublemaker and deserved being taught a lesson.

Petition: Some teens at Oakland High School claim the 17-year-old victim, Francisco Martinez, is a troublemaker, and deserved being taught a lesson

Meanwhile, the school district released a
 second video Tuesday that captures a beating just moments earlier near 
an elevator - and another security officer has faced discipline.

The latest video apparently shows Martinez slapping the hand of the second guard, identified by the school district as Shalandra Cotton, before Mitchell angrily dumps the student sideways out of his chair and kicks him.

Mitchell then drags Martinez into an elevator, where the altercation continues for some time outside of camera view.

Cotton has been placed on paid leave as the school investigates his involvement and why he didn't break up the fight.

Students claim the wheelchair-bound teen who suffers cerebral palsy is a bully and regularly runs over people's toes.

'There are some students that like [the guard] and were sympathetic,' Oakland Unified School District spokesman Troy Flint told ABC News.

'I think part of the response stems from the fact that many of the students view the attack as a peer to peer situation and they are thinking about what they would have done in that situation.'

But he said students were 'overlooking the fact that the security guard is both an adult and a school employee with higher responsibility.'

There is no consideration of reinstating Mitchell, however, despite the petition, Flint said.

'We're not giving it any consideration,' Flint said. 'There is no conceivable scenario under which Marchell Mitchell will work for Oakland Unified School District again. His fate rests with the judicial system now.'

Mitchell has pleaded not guilty to charges of felony corporal injury to a child.

He's scheduled for a pretrial hearing on June 16, the San Jose Mercury News reported.

Martinez said the attack in the original video has left him in pain.

'He slapped me,' Martinez told KTVU after leaving hospital. 'He hit me so hard, it threw me out of my chair. I hit the floor with my chin first.'

Photos his mother took after the attack show scratches to his chin and head and bruises on his arms.

Abuse: Marchell Mitchell is seen on camera lifting his arm to beat 17-year-old Francisco Martinez, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. The security guard has now been arrested

No escape: The boy was unable to move due to the handcuffs and said the security guard cursed at him

Mitchell, a substitute school resource officer who had been employed by the school following a background check last November, was trying to get students to go to class before the May incident.

Martinez 'either refused to comply or was slow to do so,' Principal Matin Abdel-Qawi said in a letter to parents seen by the San Francisco Chronicle.

Mitchell pushed his chair and, after Martinez objected and tried to push the guard away, Mitchell handcuffed the teenager to the chair, he said.

Martinez admitted that he then spit on the guard because he saw he had no other option.

'I was handcuffed, so I didn't have no way to defend myself but my mouth,' Martinez told KTVU.

Hurt: 17-year-old Martinez, pictured, said he has suffered pain since the incident two weeks ago

Treatment: He is pictured leaving hospital. He suffered a scraped chin and face and bruised arms

The footage then shows Mitchell repeatedly lifting his arm and punching the teenager as they move along the hallway before dumping him out of his chair.

He can be seen standing above the student, who is laid out on the floor, as other students stop to look before walking on.

Martinez said that he was also hit and thrown to the floor in the school's elevator before the incident, although this can not be seen on the camera footage.

Martinez, who has been undergoing therapy so he can strengthen his legs to be able to walk, added that when he told the guard he was in pain, he swore at him.

'He tells me like that, "I don't give a ***! I hope you don't walk for two to three weeks",' Martinez said.

Arrest: Mitchell, 23, was fired from the school and faces felony charges of corporal injury to a child

After the incident, Mitchell was fired and arrested by Oakland police. He has been charged with felony corporal injury to a child.

'I'm shocked and deeply hurt by this behavior and apologize on behalf of the staff at Oakland High,' Abdel-Qawi wrote. 'This incident is not reflective of the kind of culture we cherish at our school or how we treat one another.'

Francisco said he also wants the district to take action against a second security officer seen in the video, but it is not known what action they have taken, if any.

Mitchell will appear in court on June 16 for a pretrial hearing.
