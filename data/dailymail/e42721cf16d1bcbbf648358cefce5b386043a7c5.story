Australian wineries are making the move away from the traditional wine regions and taking their business south of the Bass Strait to Tasmania.

Shiraz is among the varieties increasingly being grown in the southern state, and Nick Glaetzer was one of the first to take the plunge, breaking away from his family's well-known winery in the Barossa region in South Australia.

Initially, Mr Glaetzer's family thought he was crazy trying to grow the grapes down south, which have their roots in the hot and dry Barossa and are famous for their full flavours.

But with temperatures in Australia's main regions including the Hunter Valley and Margaret River on the up according to Business Insider Australia, the young winemaker's daring move may have paid off.

They also report that a study by the U.S. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences discovered up to 73 per cent of Australian land currently used for viticulture could become unsuitable by 2050.

Mr Glaetzer left the Barossa in 2003 and travelled the world, making stops at vineyards in France and Germany, taking note on how the grapes were grown in cooler conditions.

In 2008 he settled in Tasmania, and told the Daily Mail Australia he was 'searching for cooler climate regions,' in part because conditions in the Barossa were getting warmer.

Just years later he became the first person to ever win a prestigious national award, the Jimmy Watson Memorial Trophy, for a Shiraz produced in Tasmania.

'Having worked in the colder climates in France... I understood how to grow these wines in cool climates.' Mr Glaetzer said.

His father still owns the family business, Glaetzer Wines, but Mr Glaetzer said 'I wanted to try and make different styles to what my family was doing.'

'They were a bit surprised (initially), especially picking Tasmania. There's a lot of comments from other winemakers and my family comparing it (Tasmanian wine) to light beer.'

Due to the cooler climate down south, Tasmanian wines tend to be 15-20 percent less alcoholic than those grown in hotter climates. However with global warming, predictions are that some regions may become too hot for the vineyards to properly operate.

Australian Shiraz tends not to be grown in Tasmania, with the main variety produced being Pinot Noir. However, CEO of Wine Tasmania Sheralee Davis said it's a trend that is increasing.

'It's fair to say we are seeing quite a lot of wine producers move to Tasmania... The cooler the climate, within reason, the higher quality of wine.'

Ms Davies also said growing in cooler climates is 'high risk but it's high reward', and over the past few years have seen big expansions from key wine producers in Tasmania.

Tasmanian wine is less alcoholic and more sublet in flavour, but despite this the wine industry is booming the southern state as temperatures increase in other regions

Despite the prediction that rising temperatures on mainland Australia are going to have devastating effects on the wine industry, Michael McCarthy, head of the Barossa Wine Experiment insisted even if this is the case, the change will not be immediate.

'One of the things that people need to remember is if we're going to move into a warmer drier world, it's not going to be sudden.'

Mr McCarthy said the vineyards are adapting as the changes happen, and people need not take the risk and jump ship simply because of what he described as cycles of weather.

When asked if they would make the move down south, Treasury Wine Estates (TWE), which own iconic wine brands Penfolds, Wolf Blass and Lindeman's among many others, said they are monitoring external conditions on their own.

TWE also said they are working to 'develop technologies and management practices to deal with these changes in the vineyards,' but as they already have roots down across Australia have no plans to move all production to one region.
