West Ham United co-owners David Sullivan and David Gold have revealed a 10-point plan for the club in a letter commemorating their five-year anniversary at Upton Park.

In taking over the debt-ridden Hammers on January 19, 2010, the duo issued a similar blueprint.

And now, having taken major strides towards those goals, Sullivan and Gold have stepped things up by declaring their aim to sign more world-class players, be clear of external debt by the time West Ham move to the Olympic Stadium next year, ensure watching West Ham remains affordable and continue playing entertaining football.

‘Today (Monday January 19) marks five years to the day since the moment we, as two proud Eastenders, took to the helm of the club we have loved all our lives,’ reads the letter to supporters.

‘Like you, there are no limits to our ambitions for West Ham and there is no end to our enthusiasm to achieve them.

‘But more importantly, over the coming years, we will, for the first time in the modern era, have the stadium, the playing squad and the global reach that will give us the chance to turn our collective dreams into reality.’
