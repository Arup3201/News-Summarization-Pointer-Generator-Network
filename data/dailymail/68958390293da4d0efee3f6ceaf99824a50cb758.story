Congress' do-nothing strategy has become a source of 'great frustration' for many Americans, Former White House Senior Adviser David Plouffe said today, arguing that too often Washington puts off solving the nation's problems because the solutions are politically unpopular.

'You're not sent here to occupy the darn office,' he declared.

Honing in on Tea Party Republicans, Plouffe criticized conservatives for bragging about their status as Washington outsiders.

'"Oh I'm [on] the outside. I'm sleeping on my couch,"' he said, imitating them. 'The thing they fear more than anything else is going home.'

Great Frustration: David Plouffe, former White House Senior Adviser, said today that Americans are tired of Congress 'kicking cans down the field' instead of providing long-term solutions to the nation's problems. Plouffe is pictured here during an appearance on Meet the Press in 2012

'And you gotta have people who are here to say, "Nope. For the time I'm here, whether it's bad politics, good politics, you know, I'm gonna try to get some things moving on the Hill." '

Plouffe said the 2010 healthcare reform legislation was an example of Democrats putting their political futures on the line to solve an important problem.

'Whether it be a family, a business, a church, a school, you can't just kick problems down the field. You gotta deal with them,' Plouffe said.

The Democratic operative criticized House Republicans for the way they 'just go out of town' without coming up with a 'real solution' to problems like they did last week with immigration.

'There's great frustration that the things that are broadly supported by the American people, that would help the economy, we just kick the can down the field.'

Congress is currently in recess, and lawmakers are not scheduled to return to work until September. Both the House and the Senate left town without agreeing to legislation to provide emergency funding to the Department of Homeland Security and other government agencies for illegal immigration efforts.

White House backed legislation died in the Senate on Thursday night and the House did not pass a bill until Friday night after Senators had already returned home.

The GOP-led House's bill would only have kept the agencies funded for the next several months. As a result, President Barack Obama said he would veto the legislation even if the Senate did pass it, killing all chances of the bill becoming law, regardless of whether the upper chamber had stuck around until the House was finished voting.

Congress currently has an average approval rating of 12.3 percent, according to polling website Real Clear Politics.

Christie Comeback: Plouffe named New Jersey Governor Chris Christie as one of the GOP's most viable 2016 presidential candidates. Christie, who chairs the Republican Governor's Association, spent the latter part of last week in First in the Nation presidential voting state New Hampshire. He was there campaigning for the state's Republican candidate for Governor

Plouffe made his remarks disparaging Congress at a luncheon in Washington, D.C. this afternoon hosted by Politico.

Asked about what it would mean for President Obama if Republicans win a majority of seats in the U.S. Senate in November - as they're increasingly predicted to do - Plouffe said it would depend on how the GOP decides to govern.

'If they take control of the Senate and all they want to do is investigate and go off on these witch hunts like Benghazi, it's bad for the Republican Party and the country,' he said.

Speaking about Republicans' odds at retaking the White House in 2016, the 2008 Obama campaign manager said New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush are among the most viable general election candidates, though he doesn't thank any 2016 hopefuls on the right have what he thinks it takes to win.

'This process just destroys you,' he said, talking about the toll presidential campaigns take on politicians.

The GOP needs to nominate someone who is not part of the 'Tea Party-Washington- Republican crowd,' he said and isn't someone who 'basically pledges allegiance to all of that hard right nonsense.'

The only way that Christie and Bush could win if they are 'faithful to who they are,' Plouffe said.

'They are both pretty conservative folks, but compared to the Tea Party, they're Bernie Sanders,' he said, referring to Vermont's progressive Senator.

Plouffe said if either Christie or Bush abandon their ideals to 'secure the Republican nomination, it is not a nomination worth having' because they won't be able to win the general election.
