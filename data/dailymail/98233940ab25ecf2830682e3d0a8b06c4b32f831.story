A bizarre video has emerged that apparently showing a 'possessed' woman launching a crazed attack on a man on train in Canada.

The clip was taken on an Edmonton Transit System train and posted on Thursday night on a Facebook account with the name Renee A. Carter.

In the video - which was then featured on spoof website Break.com - a young woman is seen looking through her purse when she starts exhibiting strange and violent behaviour.

This video of a 'possessed' woman apparently attacking a passenger on train in Edmonton, Canada, has emerged. She is shown grabbing her hair, and then trying to punch a man to her right

She grabs her hair and head before reaching out and grabbing the neck of the male passenger next to her.

It appears the woman then strikes out at the man and yanks on his ponytail before making her way to the train doors.

The video shows the man approaching her and shoving her several times and the woman kicks him, which leads to a struggle.

The woman then falls onto the floor of the train as ETS security arrive at the scene and subdue both individuals.

At one point, a voice off camera says: 'Hey, hey, hey, she's probably f*****g possessed.'

Although it appears the video may be a hoax, officials with ETS confirm an incident took place.

'Unfortunately, the two individuals were involved in an altercation with each other,' Cheryl Oxford, a spokeswoman with the City of Edmonton told Global News.

The two then get in a tussle (left) before security officers (right) intervene to break up the row

'But luckily, our transit peace 
officers were able to intervene quickly and appropriately, and both 
individuals were removed from the train.'

The
 ETS says transit officers were doing their rounds at Churchill Station 
when the incident occurred and were able to respond quickly.

'Safety
 is our first priority,' Oxford told Global News. 'Our transit system is safe. As 
you see on the video, the transit officers reacted quickly and 
appropriately and were able to ensure the safety of the passengers as 
soon as they were able to intervene.'

'Both of the individuals, as well as witnesses, were interviewed.'

'Based
 on all the information that we were provided, at the end of the day, we
 were able to determine that they could be released and they were issued
 violation tickets for fighting in public.'

'Fighting on the transit is a rare occurrence,' Oxford added.

Both people involved have been fined $500 for fighting in public, she said.

A complaint was not passed on to Edmonton Police Service and the force says it is not investigating the incident at this time.
