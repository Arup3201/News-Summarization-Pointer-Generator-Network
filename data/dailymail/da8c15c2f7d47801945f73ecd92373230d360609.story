They are ethereal images which show the beauty of the night-sky from around the world.

But despite initially appearing to celebrate the wonders of light above dark cities and rural landscapes, these impressive photographs also highlight concerns over it.

The images are part of The World at Night's annual 'Earth and Sky' photography contest and feature some stunning sights. But as well as celebrating beauty, the collection helps to reflect increasing worry over light pollution.

Impressive: These images are part of The World at Night's annual 'Earth and Sky' photography contest and feature some stunning sights. But as well as celebrating the beauty, they also reflect concerns. This was taken at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco

Stunning: This picture is called Stars over Salzburg and shows the glow of the Austrian city's lights from a high Alpine vantage point. The picture helps reflect concerns with light pollution

Ethereal: The night-time glow in Arizona lights up these clouds above the Roosevelt Lake Bridge

Expanse: This impressive image shows a solar eclipse over Queensland in Australia

The photographs include an incredible starry night over an impressively lit Golden Gate Bridge in California, The Milky Way perfectly visible over the Alps in Austria and a solar eclipse in Australia.

Speaking to NBC News, astrophotographer Babak Tafreshi used the image called Stars over Salzburg to demonstrate how the pictures reflect concerns with light pollution.

The picture shows the glow of the city from a high Alpine vantage point. He said people's first reaction is to be impressed with the view of the Austrian city.

But the founder of The World at Night 
added: 'But then you realise the photographer has moved away from the 
city to the mountaintops in order to separate himself from the light 
pollution.

Night beauty:  The Milky Way over Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean is pictured left, while, right, the image is called Solar Storm, it was captured over northern Norway

Radiant: The summer solstice fire festival is seen over Tyrol in Austria

Glorious: This image is called Stars or Lights and was taken in Arizona, U.S.

'Inside the yellow light cast by the city, people are no longer able to see this beauty.'

Recent studies have found that, because of lights illuminating vast cities and their surrounding areas,  80 per cent of the world's population cannot see the Milky Way.

It has also been estimated that up to $1 billion is spent in the U.S. each year generating artificial light which goes to waste.

Mr Tafreshi added that the images 'display how the night sky is becoming a forgotten part of nature for many people in urban, light-polluted areas.'
