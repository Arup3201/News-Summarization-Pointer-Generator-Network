This is the girl who has made a remarkable recovery after going from obese to anorexic.

Going from fat to thin nearly killed Alice Vinall - after she lost a staggering 11 stone in a bid to shed her bulk.

She embarked on a strict diet after doctors told her she may suffer serious future health problems because of her massive weight.

So she existed on one small meal a 
day but her obsessive diet went too far and she became gripped by the 
eating disorder anorexia.

Overweight to underweight: When 5ft 9 Alice Vinall was diagnosed with anorexia (left) she weighed just over seven stone - an 11 stone weight loss from when she was obese (right)

She
was finally admitted to an eating disorders clinic weighing just seven 
stone and spent 18 months being treated at the clinic.

She
has now made a full recovery and weighs a healthy 11 stone - but she 
wants her story to prove a stark warning to other young women.

Miss Vinall, 25, said: ‘Being fat nearly killed me, but being too thin was even more deadly. Now I’m just happy to be alive.

‘I want to show people that losing too much weight can be dangerous. Anorexia is a dangerous disease that can kill.’

Miss
Vinall, who is single and lives in Ware, Hertfordshire, had started 
putting on weight after her 18th birthday, and by the time she reached 
21 she weighed 18 stone 13.

She
said: ‘I was always out drinking and eating with my friends, and I 
would eat all the wrong things. I had a lot of takeaways and fast food, 
and alcoholic sugary drinks. .

Warned to lose weight: Alice shot up to nearly 19st at her heaviest while living a lifestyle of binging and partying

‘I started putting on weight and before I
knew it I weighed nearly 19 stone. I was young and didn’t really think 
about what I was doing. I was just concentrating on having a good time 
with my friends

‘I’d never had a problem with my weight before. At school I’d been good at sport and had been slim like all the other pupils.’

But when Miss Vinall visited her doctor, she was told that she must lose some weight, otherwise she was going to face future health problems such as heart disease and diabetes.

She said: ‘When I went to see the doctor I was shocked. I knew that I was overweight, but she told me that the health problems I may face could be life threatening to me. I knew realised that my weight was actually a danger to me.

‘That night I went home and looked hard in the mirror and was shocked by what I saw. I had got this big and now I knew I needed to do something about it.

'I was fatter than all of my friends 
and I couldn’t shop in the high street shops as they didn’t stock 
anything big enough for me.’

So Miss Vinall joined a local slimming group and embarked on a strict diet.

Instead
of gorging daily on MacDonalds burgers and steak and chips, she instead
ate chicken and salad and low calorie microwave meals.

The pounds started to fall off her, much to her delight.

She said: ‘The first week when I went back to the slimming club I had lost half a stone and I felt a rush of satisfaction. I knew that I could do it.’

But as the months went by she lost more and more weight.

Soon she was existing on just one slice of bread and a small low calorie microwave meal each day.

She said: ‘Because I wasn’t eating I just felt exhausted all the time and I found it difficult to cope with my job as a nanny.

‘Yet I would come home and spend an hour and a half running on the treadmill, trying to lose even more pounds.

‘My periods stopped because of my swift weight loss and mum and dad were so worried about my weight that dad even offered to pay me if I would put some weight back on.’

Miss Vinall stopped going to the slimming club and by 2009 her weight had dropped to a dangerously low 7 stone 13.

Miss Vinall, a pre-school manager, said: ‘I went to see the doctor as I was worried about my periods stopping as I really wanted to be a mum. The doctor told me that at 5ft9, I was dangerously underweight.’

The GP diagnosed her with anorexia and referred her to an eating disorders clinic for treatment.

She was treated for 18 months and is now back up 11 stone, which is a healthy weight for her height.

She said: ‘When I came out of the clinic I smashed the bathroom scales with a hammer and mum sold my running machine.

‘I was determined that I wouldn’t ever be obsessed about losing weight again as it became a dangerous obsession for me.

‘I have forced myself to keep eating and now I’m a healthy weight. It’s still tough but I try not to think about my weight too much.

‘Being fat nearly killed me as I could have suffered from life threatening problems, but being thin was worse. I was happier at 19 stone than I was at seven stone, but I’m just so thankful that I was treated in time and I’m still alive.

‘I feel very lucky and now I’m living my life to the full - and my weight is what it should be.’
