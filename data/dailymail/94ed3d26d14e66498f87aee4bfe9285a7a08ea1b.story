A woman has broken down in tears while testifying that her husband told her 25 years ago that he shot dead his sister and her husband.

Pam Wyngarden told the court in Holland, Michigan on Wednesday that she finally decided to speak out about her husband's 1987 confession because she could not bear lying anymore.

She said they had only been dating a few months when Ryan Wyngarden told her he had killed the couple because he feared his sister would reveal they had had a sexual relationship as teenagers.

The case of Rick and Gail Brink, who were found shot dead at the home, laid unsolved for more than 20 years before investigators decided to re-open it in 2011 and re-interview the Wyngardens.

Testimony: Pam Wyngarden broke down in court as she testified that her husband told her 25 years ago that he had killed his sister and her husband because he was jealous of their relationship

Struggle: She sobbed as she revealed she decided to speak out because she couldn't face lying anymore

At first, Mrs Wyngarden stuck to the story she had repeated for decades: That she and her husband were visiting a friend's house, where they were babysitting the children, at the time of the killings.

But as the investigation continued, the mother-of-four changed her story.

'I was concerned that I would go to jail... because I was holding this information for so long,' she said, Michigan Live reported. 'I told myself I can't have this burden on my shoulders. I can't live with this.'

In court, she recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating.

Emotional: Her husband, Ryan Wyngarden, sobbed and yelled that he was innocent of the crimes

Outburst: As his wife said they had been very in love 25 years ago, he shouted that they still are

'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, "What's wrong?" and he said, "I shot and killed Rick and Gail". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.'

Arrest: Wyngarden was arrested in January after investigators re-opened the cold case

When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said.

Mrs Wyngarden explained that this intimate relationship had been a sexual one.

As she testified, her husband, now 50, sobbed and shouted: 'How can you say these things? I didn't kill them, I didn't.'

As the testimony continues on Thursday, he will be placed in a separate room, from where he will watch the proceedings to avoid any further outbursts.

The bodies of Rick, 28, and Gail Brink, 22, were found by Rick's parents, Isla and Bud Brink, after he failed to show up for work. The couple had last been seen two days before at a wedding.

In court this week, Mrs Brink recounted finding her daughter-in-law on the bed with a pillow over her head and multiple gun wounds. Her son was also found shot dead in his truck outside the home.

The couple had been married less than 18 months at the time of their deaths.

In the years after Wyngarden allegedly told his wife about the murder, he demanded she kept it a secret and would not allow her to have any friends, in fear that she would tell them, she said.

Loss: Gail Brink was 22 when she was killed, and her husband Rick was 28. They had been married 18 months

Missed: Rick's parents found the couple shot dead at their home after he failed to turn up to work

She said their marriage was very dysfunctional, as her relationship had been with her father.

The case fell cold as investigators found no apparent motives and believed that the Brinks could have been victims of mistaken identity.

The trial continues.
