Children could be taught in football stadiums, bingo halls and even a former Woolworths store by 2015 as a baby boom and immigration put pressure on primary schools.

At least 454,571 additional places in primaries will be required in England within three years.

This equates to 2,030 extra schools, with an average intake of 224 pupils.

Councils are scouring empty buildings to house lessons as they struggle to accommodate the influx of pupils.

The estimates – based on Department for Education figures following a survey of 151 local authorities – were released yesterday by Labour’s education spokesman Stephen Twigg.

He said the Coalition must use the Budget to tackle the issue.

The Tories and Liberal Democrats have previously accused the former Labour Government of failing to prepare sufficiently for the looming admissions crisis.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said the last government ignored warnings of a baby boom as early as 2004

The worst affected areas include Lancashire, which needs almost 14,000 extra primary places by 2015; Birmingham, Leeds, Hertfordshire and Hampshire, which all require more than 11,000, and Kent, Manchester and Essex, which need more than 9,000.

Across London, an additional 100,000 primary places are needed by 2015.

In Barking and Dagenham, where more than 8,000 extra primary places are required, the council is proposing to rent out a former Woolworths store and a warehouse from MFI to house temporary classes.

Officials in East Sussex are considering teaching pupils in Brighton and Hove Albion FC’s football stadium, a bingo hall or in redundant churches due to a shortage of school places.

And at Ladybarn Primary School in Manchester, a surge in numbers means pupils have to eat their lunch in five different shifts, with the first wave sitting down to eat at 11.15am. The dining hall is too small to accommodate all 400 pupils at once.

Tens of thousands of children are already being squeezed into overcrowded schools, with one in five primaries at bursting point.

Some 3,428 were classified as ‘full or had pupils in excess of school capacity’ in May last year.

Up to half of primary schools in Brighton and Hove, and Bromley in South East London, were at bursting point. And out of 41 primary schools in Sutton, South London, 26 were full or had excess numbers of pupils.  Mr Twigg yesterday accused the Government of being ‘oblivious’ to the problem and ‘preferring to focus on pet projects’ such as free schools.

He said: ‘The Government needs to address this head on in the budget – allocating all its education capital to meeting real need, not salami slicing some off for pet projects.’

But Education Secretary Michael Gove accused Labour of hypocrisy, pointing out that the last government ignored Office for National Statistics warnings of a baby boom as early as 2004. Under Labour, councils were told to cut primary places.

Mr Gove said: ‘Labour’s hypocrisy is breathtaking. For years they ignored warnings about the baby boom and splurged billions on extravagant secondary school projects instead.

‘By contrast, we have more than doubled funding for extra places to give local authorities the resources they need.’

Last July, Mr Gove announced £500million of funding to create more primary places in time for September 2012, taking the total spend to £1.3billion in 2011/12.

Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘There are limits to how far a primary can grow and still retain the ethos that makes it special and welcoming to young children.

‘Primaries can run well at 500 or even 700 pupils, but then you’re stretching it.’
