India is going to have to wait a little longer for its first Playboy bunnies after authorities stopped promoters opening the country's first Playboy club.

The government in Goa has, after a month of heated debate, refused permission for the club which had been planned to open in a 22,000 sq/ft open-air site on upmarket Candolim beach.

Women's groups and conservative politicians had attacked the proposed club, with Michael Lobo, a legislator from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party saying it was 'tantamount to promoting prostitution.'

But in the end local officials stopped the club from opening in one of India's best-known party locations on technical grounds.

Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar told the state assembly yesterday that licenses to run so-called beach shacks - even ones as large as the proposed Playboy club - could not be granted to companies, only individuals.

'We cannot give them a license to operate a beach shack,' Mr Parrikar said of the application by Mumbai-based PD Lifestyle, which last year got hold of an exclusive license to market the Playboy brand in India.

The company had planned to start with the club in Goa and then expand to the southern city of Hyderabad.

PB Lifestyle chief executive Sanjay Gupta said last year he was working to recast Playboy into an aspirational lifestyle brand, distancing his firm from nudity and toning down the traditional, body-hugging bunny costume.

Goa's decision does not bar the opening of a conventional Playboy club in in the state, just the beach shack. But Mr Lobo has called on the government to prevent Playboy from setting up shop in any form in the state.

'It is not just a question of permitting Playboy in Candolim. It should be banned across Goa, because Goa should be veered away from international chains which promote vulgarity,' he said.

Agnelo Fernandes, a local Congress politician on whose land the beach club was to be located, called the government's decision 'unfortunate.'

He has been acting as a de facto spokesman for the project during the controversy.

'It would have been great for Goa to have an international lifestyle brand. There is no question of vulgarity. Our bunny costumes which we had designed were more sober than the one's worn by the cheerleaders at the IPL (Indian Premier League),' Mr Fernandes said, referring to a raucous Indian cricket league.

Mr Gupta did not immediately respond to a message left at his office, the Associated Press reported.
