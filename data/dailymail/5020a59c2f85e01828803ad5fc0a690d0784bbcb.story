West Brom have been handed a further fitness boost, with forwards Brown Ideye and Victor Anichebe in line for a return to training early next week.

Nigeria internationals Ideye and Anichebe have both missed Albion's last two matches due to ankle and groin problems, respectively.

But Baggies head coach Alan Irvine has revealed they are close to resuming work with the group - news that comes 24 hours after West Brom announced their other recent absentee, winger Silvestre Varela, is set to return to training next week having had a minor groin operation.

Irvine told wba.co.uk on Thursday: 'We are expecting Brown and Victor to train at the beginning of next week - certainly Brown, Victor we are not as confident about.

'He's 50-50 in terms of being able to train on Monday, but Brown we are almost certain will train then.'
