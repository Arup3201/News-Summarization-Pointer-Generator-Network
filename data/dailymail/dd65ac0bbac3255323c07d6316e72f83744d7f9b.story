With its idyllic beaches and seemingly limitless sunshine, most of us have long known that it is the lucky country.

And according to an international league table of happiness, Australia truly does take some beating on its quality of life.

It has ranked number one on the OECD’s first such chart – and, somewhat unsurprisingly,  well ahead of Britain, which  came tenth.

Winner: Australia is the best place in the world to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

But while Britons may not be quite as 
content as our friends Down Under, we’re happier than the Germans or the
 French, according to the rankings.

Australia’s strong economy, good 
public health, low pollution and low levels of crime were some of the 
reasons why it is better off, the OECD said.

The attraction is already well known 
to the tens of thousands of Britons flocking there each year in search 
of a better life. In 2011 49,000 emigrated Down Under.

The OECD’s Better Life Index is based 
on 11 categories, including income, jobs, housing and health, surveyed 
in 36 nations. Overall, the UK was beaten by a string of Scandinavian 
countries, among them Sweden, Norway and Denmark.

Britain scored highly on income 
levels, high employment, low crime, and community spirit – measured by 
polls that found almost everyone knew a person they could rely on in 
times of trouble. It also ranked highly on the environment, based on 
lower air pollution and water quality.

But it was marked down because of 
overcrowding, a school system which ‘favours the rich over the poor’, 
and because the OECD says state spending and benefit cuts ‘will affect 
many families’.

Feeling good: In general, Australians are more satisfied with their lives than the OECD average, with 84 per cent of people saying they have more positive experiences in an average day

Its report added: ‘Progress in child 
poverty reduction in the UK has stalled; social protection spending on 
families needs to be protected.

‘Providing services such as affordable
 and good quality local day-care centres, with flexible opening hours, 
is key to helping families with children on low incomes into work.’

Specifically on happiness levels, 
grumpy Britons lagged behind. In surveys on life satisfaction, recently 
introduced to national statistics by David Cameron, they rated 
themselves at 6.8 out of 10. However, the French are even less cheerful,
 giving themselves 6.6 out of 10. Australians, by contrast, scored 7.2, 
well above the OECD average of 6.6.

France came 18th due to high 
unemployment and poor education for some of its people, beaten by the  
Germans, who were in 17th place. Despite high life expectancy and levels
 of health spending, they rated poorly on health.

However, if work-life balance is given
 the most weight, Australia becomes one of the worst developed nations 
in which to live. More than 14 per cent of Australian workers put in 
more than 50 hours a week, way above the OECD average of 9 per cent.

Eurozone countries, many struggling 
with debt crises and high unemployment, did badly in the index. France, 
Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece were all rated in the bottom half of 
the table.

Down: The life expectancy birth in the United States is almost 79 years, one year lower than the OECD average of 80 years - women live to an average 81 years, compared with 76 for men
