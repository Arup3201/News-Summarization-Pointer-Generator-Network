The high-priced prostitute accused of killing a Google executive by injecting him with heroin claims she was simply following orders.

Alix Tichelman, 26, was on board Forrest Hayes's yacht in Santa Cruz, California, when the 51-year-old father-of-five suffered a lethal overdose and died last November, a court has heard.

But denying manslaughter, Tichelman's lawyers insist her customer requested the shot. 

'Consensual': Lawyers for Alex Tichelman (pictured) in court on Monday said she and Google executive Forrest Hayes were 'consensual adults involved in mutual drug usage'

'My client Alix didn't do anything to Mr Hayes that he didn't want to happen to him,' defense attorney Larry Biggam said at a procedural hearing today, according to NBC. 

'She did what she was asked. Consensual adults involved in mutual drug usage. It went wrong but it wasn't intended.' 

Biggam also called on police to release the full surveillance video taken from the boat, which prosecutors are using as evidence for a number of allegations. 

The footage allegedly shows Tichelman injecting Hayes before watching him die then finishing her glass of wine and stepping over the body.

She then spends time researching legal strategies online, police claim, before gathering her belongings to leave, hours before Hayes was found dead.

Police have berated Tichelman for appearing to make no effort to call 911 in the video described. 

Her defense team has only seen 20 minutes of the footage described in court but Biggam insists it shows the overdose was 'accidental'.

She now faces eight charges which all carry 15-year jail terms, including manslaughter, prostitution, destroying evidence and several related to administering and possessing heroin.

The next hearing is scheduled for December 5. 

Accusations: Police claim a surveillance video shows Tichelman watching Hayes die before stepping over him 

On board: Tichelman's lawyers want police to release a surveillance video taken from the Santa Cruz yacht where Hayes was found which they claim proves it was an accidental, consensual overdose of heroin

Tichelman, who met her clients through a website called Seeking Arrangement, had exchanged texts and emails with Hayes and met with him a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter.

That day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, police said. 

Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident before eventually uncovering Tichelman's correspondence with the victim.

They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County by posing as a client who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. She agreed to meet at a luxury hotel on Fourth of July and was arrested.

She was booked into jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, concealing evidence and transportation of narcotics and remains there on a $1.5 million bond.

Hayes, who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his obituary.

He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google.

'Forrest will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on his boat,' according to a January obituary.

'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.'

Tichelman's Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist.

She called herself a 'model' in jail records.

On social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera.

Charges: Tichelman is facing up to 15 years for  eight charges including manslaughter and prostitution

Lured: She was arrested after law enforcement officers posed as a client and lured her to a Santa Cruz hotel

In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character.

'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an "intense child" and already liked horror movies.'

She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her boyfriend.

She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the serial killer TV show, 'Dexter'.

Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.
