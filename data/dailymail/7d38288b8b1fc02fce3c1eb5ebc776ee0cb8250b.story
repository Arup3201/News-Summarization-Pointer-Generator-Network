Knock-off movies are enjoying a resurgence thanks to the rise of online film distribution sites which make it easier to 'confuse' customers into buying the wrong flick.

Production companies say distribution systems such as Netflix and Redbox provide a 'great opportunity' to sell their imitations, which are made at a fraction of the price.

But consumers have taken issue with the 
tactics because it is harder to distinguish between the two when glancing online as opposed to browsing in the rental store.

Confusing: The DreamWorks blockbuster Puss In Boots (left) cost $130million, whereas its 'mockbuster' Puss In Boots: A Furry Tail had a budget of just $1million. The imitation was released around the same time on DVD

Slick: The DreamWorks version of Puss In Boots was made using the very latest an animation over four years

Mocked up: Behind the similar DVD cover design of Puss In Boots: A Furry Tail lies a rather less sophisticated animation

The knock-offs - known as 
'mockbusters' - are what the film industry calls a 'drafting 
opportunity' which looks to piggyback off a box office smash by using 
similarly titled versions.

They
 invariably come out on DVD at around the same time as their 
budget-busting equivalent in a bid to cash in on the $18.8billion-a-year
 home entertainment business.

One example was last year's Puss in 
Boots: A Furry Tail, which was made by 12 people in an office building 
by Renegade Animation for less than $1million.

By comparison, the DreamWorks version 
Puss in Boots, starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek, was made by 
300 people for fours years at cost of $130million.

Too similar: Production company The Asylum 
changed the name of its Battle: Los Angeles mockbuster, Battle of Los 
Angeles, to Attack Los Angeles because it was confusing buyers

Cashing in: Battle of Los Angeles looked to exploit its blockbuster by creating a similar look to original

Its other knock-off The True Story Of Puss 'N Boots was given more than 1,300 negative reviews on Redbox.

One customer said: 'I made the mistake of renting this thinking it was the Antonio Banderas version. BIG mistake.'

Other mockbusters include Abraham Lincoln Vs Zombies
 (imitating Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter), Kiara the Brave (based on 
Pixar's Brave) and Life's a Jungle: Africa's Most Wanted (exploiting 
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted).

David Rimawi, a partner at The Asylum, which has built much of its business on mockbusters, admitted to the Los Angeles Times that they are having to change the designs of their products to avoid such confusion.

As a result, 2011's Battle Of Los Angeles became Attack Los Angeles.

Drafting opportunities have been given quite a free reign legally since 1993 when Disney lost a lawsuit against Good Times Entertainment, now owned by Gaiam, over their versions of Aladdin.

A U.S. district court judge ruled that the VHS boxes were not similar enough to violate the law.

More recently, Universal Pictures sued The Asylum over claims the latter's American Battleship knock-off was too similar to the former's Battleship.

The companies settled out of court, with The Asylum agreeing to change its name to American Warships.

'As people have migrated to these new platforms, it has been a great opportunity for us," said Sam Toles, vice president of content and acquisitions for Gaiam Entertainment.

'We're not trying to confuse people. We're trying to take advantage of a level of interest in a concept that exists thanks to the major studio release', he told the Los Angeles Times.
