The Minnesota Republican Party county official who called Muslims 'parasites' on his personal Facebook account has resigned and lost his job at his local hardware store.

Republican Jack Whitley resigned from his position as Big Stone County GOP Chair after coming under fire for calling Muslims terrorists, 'parasites,' and saying they deserve to be killed.

Though Whitley had no plans to resign initially, he said he was asked to do so by other board members.

In two separate posts last week, Whitley wrote that he does not believe Muslim terrorists should be waterboarded because that would be a 'waste of resources,' but they should be 'fragged' -- killed using a hand grenade -- instead.

He said that millions of Muslims -- who he called parasites -- should be fragged on their travel to Mecca. 

When Whitley came under fire for these comments, he returned to Facebook to voice his opinions.

Whitley wrote that he will not apologize or compromise and continued to write that Muslims need to accept Jesus Christ or leave the country. 

In a statement, the GOP condemned Whitley's remarks and called them 'outrageous,' according to the StarTribune.

'They could not be further from the Republican Party's beliefs, Keith Downey, Minnesota Republican Party Chairman, said, 'nor more contrary to the efforts we have undertaken to include Muslim Americans, and every American, in our Party.' 

Whitley's resignation was effective Friday, and the Tribune reports that the anti-Muslim comments have cost Whitley is job at a hardware store in Ortonville.

'Everything Jack said was so contrary to the way my husband and I conduct our life and the way we believe and think that we just couldn't tolerate it,' Sue Kulbeik, one owner of 'Hardware Hank,' said.

'We even asked him, 'Is that really how you feel?' And he said, 'Absolutely,'' Kulbeik said. 

'We said, 'You're no longer needed at our store.'

Whitley declined to tell the Associated Press whether he would continue to stand by his statements.
