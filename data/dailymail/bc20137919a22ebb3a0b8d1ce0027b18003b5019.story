A doctor, who was confronted by anti-abortion campaigners, told them that 'aborting ugly black babies' was a service to the taxpayer.

Doctor Ron Virmani was captured on camera last month by pro-life Christian group, Operation Save America.

Two activists wearing T-shirts with religious slogans approached the ob-gyn's door in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Outrage: Dr Ron Virmani made the horrific remarks when members of a Christian pro-life group visited his home in Charlotte, North Carolina

In the short clip, the man who is holding the front door ajar, can be heard saying: 'Don't put pregnancy and adoption on the taxpayers.'

A campaigner then asks: 'What does that got to do with the babies?'

Virmani replies: 'Don't put it on the taxpayers, okay? I don't wish to pay for the baby with my money.'

A female campaigner then asks the doctor: 'You would rather profit off of those children?'

Confrontation: Operation Save America had gone to visit the doctor after he became known to them as someone who performed abortions

He responded: 'No, no, no. I am not profiting. I, as a taxpayer, do not wish to pay for those babies to be born and brought up and kill those people in Colorado.'

He allegedly is referring to the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado where 12 people and an unborn child died and 58 people were injured.

The doctor continues: 'Go ahead and pay for them. Let me see you adopt one of those ugly black babies.

The church members respond: 'If you tell us, we'll adopt them.'

The 37-second clip has been viewed 16,000 times on YouTube. Operation Save America is a fundamentalist, conservative Christian group based in Dallas, Texas who campaign against abortion.

Day Gardner, president of the National Black Pro-Life Union, expressed outrage over the doctor's comments.

He said in a statement: 'It’s all too obvious that he had a particular disgust for black babies and therefore has no problem killing them.'
