In the wake of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar's murder in Pune and a photojournalist's gang-rape in Mumbai, a regional language news channel in Maharashtra carried the pictures of chief minister Prithiviraj Chavan, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and home minister R R Patil with the caption 'Murda' (dead).

It was a strong statement but one that aptly summed up the general sentiment against the government - in fact, the entire political class - across the state.

The political leadership seems simply incapable of doing anything to stem the rot that the state had slipped into.

Law and order - its absence, to be precise - has particularly been an area of concern. The amount of pressure on the government can be gauged by the fact that home minister R R Patil himself went to the NM Joshi Marg police station, where the gang-rape case was registered, and was present during the interrogation of the accused.

Chief minister Prithviraj Chavan, along with other cabinet members, went to pay his last respects to Dabholkar and also visited the Mumbai gang-rape victim in the hospital.

Nervous

That has, however, not assuaged the public anger and the Congress-NCP coalition government has been facing the Opposition heat.

BJP leader Devendra Phadnavis said the two recent incidents of crime "shows that there is no law and order in the state".

The Shiv Sena, which at one time used to laud R R Patil, also slammed him and called for his resignation.

While Patil's detractors in the NCP are happy, the top leadership is worried that his sliding performance - as that of other ministers from the party - could hurt the NCP's prospects in the next Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.

This nervousness is betrayed by the fact that the NCP, which until two years ago was flexing its muscles and planning to go it alone in the next elections, seems to have changed its mind. 

It has decided to contest in alliance with the Congress and on the basis of the old seat-sharing formula.

Political analyst and associate professor in the University of Mumbai, Aruna Pendse, said the fact that the NCP has decided not to demand more seats from the Congress shows the party is on the back foot.

"The two big faces of the NCP in the state are R R Patil and Ajit Pawar and they have been facing flak for a number of issues - Patil for the law and order issue and Pawar for his alleged involvement in the irrigation scam and his insensitive comments in the aftermath of drought.

"Thanks to these leaders, the NCP's image has taken a beating and that could hurt its prospects in the polls," Pendse said.

Poll prospects

According to Pendse, the irrigation scam and the poor law and order situation will not damage the Congress as much as its alliance partner.

"The people know that Patil and Pawar are the faces of the NCP and that they are responsible for the mess in their departments. Also, if the Congress rolls out the Food Security Bill even by December, it could create a favourable impact among the voters," said Pendse.

Also, CM Chavan has maintained a clean image in spite of all the controversies.

Not all, however, agree. The anti-incumbency factor, price rise and the lack of development are some of the strong factors that go against the Congress.

The only solace for the ruling parties 
is that the Opposition seems to be in the shambles and has not been able
to capitalise on the government's failures.

Pendse also feels that despite the hammering that its image has taken, the NCP may not face a poll rout simply because its elected representatives control Western Maharashtra's economy through the sugar cooperatives.

"For the NCP, the emphasis would be on retaining its current eight seats and then try to get more," she said.

If the prognosis for the ruling parties is grim, the Opposition's prospects are not bright either. The BJP is grappling with infighting and the lack of an inspiring leader. Its two biggest leaders in the state, Gopinath Munde and Nitin Gadkari, are staunch rivals.

The situation of its ally, the Shiv Sena, is even worse. Since Bal Thackeray's death, the Senais fast becoming a spent force. Uddhav Thackeray lacks the charisma of his father. Its ties with the BJP have also been strained of late as it's openly aired its unease with Narendra Modi.

With elections approaching, all eyes will be on Raj Thackeray-led MNS, which is being courted by both the BJP and the Congress.

While the people are angry over the failure of political leadership, the political parties are only worried about the impact of some recent developments on their electoral fortunes.

Chief minister Prithviraj Chavan maybe at the receiving end of all the criticism, but it would be unfair to blame him solely for all that transpires in the state.

The Congress and its ally NCP are both in power in the state with almost equal number of seats shared between them. The portfolios are divided between the two in such a manner that the Congress doesn't interfere in the departments held by the NCP and vice versa. Take for example the CCTV promise.

Chavan has not been able to pull up state home minister R R Patil, whose department is supposed to handle the CCTV installation programme, because Patil belongs to the NCP.

Even in the case of bad roads in the state, the chief minister has not been able to assert much as the Public Works Department (PWD) and the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) are headed by NCP ministers.

When the chief minister did try to intervene in the irrigation scam, it shook the stability of the government. Last year, Chavan had questioned how the irrigation department had spent close to Rs 70,000 crore on irrigation projects but had not been able to bring even one per cent of land under cultivation.

This led to a war of words between the chief minister and his deputy Ajit Pawar of the NCP. Pawar had held the irrigation portfolio till a few years ago. The feud between them went to such an extent that Ajit resigned as the deputy chief minister in September last year, prompting a spate of resignations from his supporters.

While the crisis was averted and Ajit was brought back as deputy chief minister a few days later, the issue clearly showed how the two ruling parties were actually behaving in a state of opposition and hurling charges against each other.

Chavan has also been constrained in his task of providing good governance from elements within his own party. Since Chavan took over as the chief minister, there have been at least three attempts to unseat him.

One of attempts was led by State Congress president Manikrao Thakre. Chavan despite hailing from the state does not have a support base of MLAs. This means that almost all factions in the Congress are gunning for him. Many of his party's ministers do not listen to him.
