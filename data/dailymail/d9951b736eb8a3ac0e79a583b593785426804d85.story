BBC presenter Chris Evans won 300,000 extra listeners to his Radio 2 Breakfast Show in the last three months of 2014, figures reveal.

But it was different news over at BBC Radio 5 Live – as morning show host Nicky Campbell shed more than 400,000 listeners from his weekly audience.

According to Rajar, which monitors radio listening figures, Evans now attracts an average audience of 9.6million a week, while Campbell – who presents his show alongside Rachel Burden – typically has 2.2million.

Evans, 48, has seen his weekly audience grow from 8.1million since he took over the Radio 2 Breakfast Show from Sir Terry Wogan in 2010. His all-time high was 9.8million, which he reached in the last three months of 2013.

Campbell, 53, joined Radio 5 Live in 1997 and has occasionally hit the headlines for his on-air outbursts. Last year, he broke down in tears during a discussion about a controversial Coronation Street storyline about the right to die.

However, he has struggled to win the same kind of attention enjoyed by the BBC's other major breakfast programmes.

There were other bright spots in the Rajar figures, however.

Radio 6 Music, a digital radio station that was nearly axed in 2010 because it was supposedly too 'niche', saw its weekly audience surge to 2.1m listeners – a record for any digital station in the UK, and almost as many listeners as Nicky Campbell's breakfast show.

The performance is a huge victory for campaigners who battled to save the show from being cut.

Bob Shennan, controller of Radio 2 and 6 Music, said he was 'thrilled' that it was doing so well.

'Huge thanks to our passionate and dedicated audience who have played such an important part in making 6 Music a unique and exciting destination.'

He added that he was also 'delighted' by Mr Evans' performance.

Overall, the number of people tuning into BBC radio shows fell, as commercial radio stations picked up a bigger share of the listening audience.
