Two boys who were allegedly kidnapped by their parents last week and taken by boat to Cuba think they went on a 'big adventure', their grandparents revealed today.

Four-year-old Cole Hakken and his brother Chase, two, grinned and posed at a press conference in Tampa on Thursday - the first time they have been seen publicly since returning from Cuba.

Just two hours earlier, their parents, Joshua and Sharyn Hakken, made their first court appearance in Tampa on kidnapping charges. They remain held without bond.

Before the boys appeared, their maternal grandparents Patricia and Bob Hauser revealed that the youngsters do not know they were allegedly kidnapped.

'They have been told that everyone heard about their sailboat trip to Cuba - "another country", as they call it,' Mrs Hauser told the press. 'And their airport ride back to America, and that everyone wants to take their picture... We are treating it as if they went on a vacation.'

She added that they are letting the boys share details of their 'adventure' in their own time, saying that so far they have not described what they did on the trip.

When the boys came out of the house, they smiled and waved at the cameras - and Cole even dropped to the ground to lay on his side and pose for pictures.

'Thank you for taking my picture,' Chase said quietly as they were ushered back into the home.

Mrs Hauser told the press that the boys have undergone health checks and are well - aside from a few bug bites. She added that authorities also retrieved the family dog, who was dehydrated.

She said it had been a fraught week since the boys were allegedly snatched by their parents - and she described her relief at finally knowing they were safe.

'They called us from Cuba and let us talk to the boys before they ever left Cuba,' she said. 'We were just smiling from ear to ear and couldn't wait for that plane to arrive.'

The boys had been living at the Hauser's home since last year, but Mrs Hauser was granted permanent custody of Chase and Cole on Tuesday of last week.

Joshua Hakken lost custody of his 
sons last year after a drug possession arrest in Louisiana, and he later
 tried to take them from a foster home at gunpoint, authorities have 
said.

Mr Hauser said that they had never imagined they would be bringing up Cole and Chase - but that the 'smart, chatty' boys were a joy each day.

'It was initially a change of life-style for us, but having these boys here is just amazing,' he said.

Relief: The Hausers said they sobbed with joy when they learned the boys had been found

Pact: The grandparents had asked the press not to mention anything to the boys about being kidnapped

'I come home from work at the end of a
 bad day and the two will come running up hugging and kissing me 
[saying] "Papa's home! Papa's home!" It's just wonderful. We wouldn't 
trade it for anything.'

On Wednesday, Mrs Hauser's 
son-in-law, Joshua Hakken, allegedly entered her house, which is just 
north of Tampa, and tied her up, before fleeing with the boys.

Mrs Hauser allegedly noticed that he had a 
gun when he came to her house to kidnap the children, and before he left
 she heard him say: 'Phase one completed. Ready for phase two.'

Federal, state and local authorities 
searched by air and sea for the
25-foot 1972 Morgan sailboat the 
35-year-old father had recently bought.

It was reported that Hakken likely bought it with the kidnapping in mind, as it 
has enough room to easily fit four people on board.

The truck that Hakken, his wife 
Sharyn and the boys had been traveling in was found late on Thursday, 
abandoned in a parking garage in Madeira Beach.

An Amber Alert for the boys was issued in Florida, Louisiana and other states as part of standard kidnapping protocols.

Authorities received information that
 the Hakken family had arrived on Cuba on Monday and a CNN 
reporter who sailed to the shore questioned a man on a boat who said he 
was Hakken.

He declined to answer questions however and Cuban security asked the CNN reporter to leave. He was with a woman fitting the description of his wife who said the two boys were doing OK.

Earlier Tuesday, Foreign Ministry 
official Johana Tablada said in a statement that Cuba had informed U.S. 
authorities of the country's decision to turn over the couple and their 
children.

Authorities had characterized the Hakkens as 'anti-government.'

'These are not dumb people. They're 
very intelligent people with some emotional issues,' Hillsborough 
Sheriff's spokesman Larry McKinnon said.  'Our goal is to still resolve this peacefully.'

Court documents released Friday state
 that Mr Hakken has previously planned to commit suicide and discussed 
taking 'a journey to Armageddon,' the Tampa Bay Times reported.

The sheriff's office issued a warrant
 for the arrest of Joshua Hakken for two counts of kidnapping, 
two counts child neglect, two counts false imprisonment, one count 
burglary with a battery and one count grand theft auto.
