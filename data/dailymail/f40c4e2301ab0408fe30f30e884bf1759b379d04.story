Under attack: Fraudsters have targeted account holders at the private bank, one of the oldest in the world, by knocking on their doors wearing fake uniforms

Fraudsters dressed as private bankers are targeting some of Britain's richest customers by knocking on their door and asking for financial information, it was revealed today.

C Hoare & Co, the nation's oldest private bank, has written to account holders warning them to be vigilant as scammers become increasingly confident.

Dressed in distinctive uniforms with extensive braiding, the organised fraudsters target three customers a week, fooling some out of thousands of pounds.

First, they send a series of emails to some of the 10,000 customers from a bogus website, before following up with a home visit in costume.

Hacking emails, they managed to squander as much as £500,000 from the client of one account holder.

Alexander Hoare, managing partner and a descendant of the founder of C Hoare & Co, told MailOnline: 'Everyone is under attack all the time, we need to keep people's guards up.

'We've got professional defences, and as a private bank we can recognise a customer's voice, which most banks cannot do.

'But we are urging customers to use our internet banking system, which is safer than post, or the mobile app once it is built.'

The bank, which has a balance sheet of around £2.3billion, has been owned and directed by members of the Hoare family since it was founded by Richard Hoare in 1672.

Started during a surge of private banks in the 17th and 18th century, it is the only remaining firm of its kind.

The family moved their business to Fleet Street from Cheapside in 1690, where it remains today.

Warning: Alexander Hoare, managing partner and descendant of the founder, has written to account holders

Mr Hoare has written to customers warning them about the growing threats posed by hackers, writing: 'About three customers a week have their email accounts hacked, which is invariably inconvenient and sometimes very expensive.

'Criminals are routinely posturing as the bank to try to trick you out of your cards and passwords with the intent of stealing.

'They do this both online and in person, and if someone asks you for your card and PIN, it's not us!'
