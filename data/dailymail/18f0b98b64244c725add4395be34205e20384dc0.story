Two British brands came together on the deck of an American aircraft carrier in New York City on Monday night to announce a partnership which will one day send the first paying customers into space.

Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic and Land Rover announced the joint venture during a glitzy ceremony on the retired and storied USS Intrepid. The firms said it demonstrated their shared vision of pioneering spirit, technological innovation and sense of adventure.

Featuring SpaceshipTwo, the world's first commercial passenger carrying spacecraft and Land Rover's new Discovery Vision Concept car, they confirmed that Land Rover will now be the official vehicles for all Virgin Galactic's future astronauts.

Intrepid partnership: Land Rover, the British brand synonymous with adventure, has revealed a long-term global partnership with Richard Branson's pioneering commercial space venture, Virgin Galactic

British giants: The partnership will see Land Rover's become a part of daily life for the Virgin Galactic team and its intrepid customers as they arrive in New Mexico for training

The partnership will see Land Rover become a part of daily life for the Virgin Galactic team and its intrepid customers as they arrive in New Mexico for training.

Land Rover will base a fleet of vehicles at the Virgin Galactic test centre in the Mojave Desert, California and at its operational New Mexico base, Spaceport America. 

The announcement was revealed in dramatic fashion on board USS Intrepid, a former aircraft carrier and now a museum dedicated to the exploration of sea, air and space and anchored on the Hudson River. 

Land Rover’s first act as exclusive partner was to bring a unique full-size replica of SpaceShipTwo VSS Enterprise to New York, where it joined the Space Shuttle Enterprise upon the Intrepid.

Future: Land Rover unveiled its concept car which features technologies that will be added into a new fleet of Discoveries. They include Gesture Controls, which allows the drivers to open doors, activate indicators and turn on the headlamps using their hands

Branson, who founded Virgin Galactic, said, 'We couldn’t be more delighted to have Land Rover join us on our incredible journey. It is hard to think of a brand which is more synonymous with exploration and adventure.

'We look forward to crossing the final frontier together and to a long and fruitful partnership.'

Like the Space Shuttle, SpaceShipTwo is the first of a revolutionary fleet of reusable human spacecraft. 

Revealed alongside SpaceShipTwo was Land Rover’s Discovery Vision Concept, the company's vision of Land Rover’s future family of Discovery vehicles. 

The vehicle uses augmented reality technology to display a ‘see-through’ view of the terrain ahead, making the front of the car ‘virtually’ invisible from inside the cabin.

Gesture Control allows you to open the doors, operate the indicators or turn on the headlamps simply by moving your hand, while Laser Referencing projects visible markings, symbols and imagery onto the ground ahead to aid low speed or difficult maneuvers.

Phil Popham, Group Marketing Director of Jaguar Land Rover said 'This is a marriage of two of Britain’s most iconic brands who celebrate shared values, a pioneering spirit and a true sense of adventure.

More than 200 VIP guests witnessed the two game-changing vehicles, which were revealed against a Manhattan background and an awe-inspiring projection mapping sequence. 

Courtesy of Land Rover, SpaceShipTwo, will remain on display at Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum for the public to view from 15th to the 22nd April.  

It will sit alongside Enterprise, the prototype NASA orbiter that paved the way for the space shuttle programme and the record-breaking and revolutionary supersonic passenger airliner, the Concorde.

Last April, SpaceShipTwo made its first powered flight over the Mojave Desert. To date, the company has accepted more than $70 million in deposits for space flights from about 580 people. That’s about 10 percent more people than the total number who have ever gone to space, said Virgin Galactic.

SpaceShipTwo is a enhanced version of SpaceShipOne. The original rocket plane, which won the $10 million Ansari X Prize for private spaceflight in 2004 in Mojave, now lives at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.

'2014 will be the year when we will finally put our beautiful spaceship in her natural environment of space. Today, we had our own Chief Pilot flying another flawless supersonic flight and proving the various systems required to take us safely to space, as well as providing the very best experience while we’re up there,' said Virgin CEO Richard Branson.

Celebrities have already started signing up for the exclusive space tours ready to take off later this year. NBC reports that Katy Perry and Justin Bieber have already signed up. Tickets cost $250,000.
