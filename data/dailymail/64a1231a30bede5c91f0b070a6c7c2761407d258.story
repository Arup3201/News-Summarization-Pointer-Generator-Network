Fur is flying at Crufts, with some owners complaining that too many foreign dogs have been allowed in.

This year, Britain's biggest dog show has 3,000 entrants from abroad. Their numbers have been growing since 2001, when legal changes meant pets no longer had to spend six months in quarantine to enter the UK.

But the influx has prompted complaints from owners, who say Crufts is a British event. Others claim foreign rivals have an unfair advantage because they have more experience using hairspray and cosmetic products on dogs – Crufts has only allowed such 'performance enhancers' since 2013.

World beating: Fur is flying at Crufts, with some owners complaining that too many foreign dogs now compete. Some claims foreign rivals have an unfair advantage because they have more experience using hairspray

In 2009 there were 1,100 foreign dogs at Crufts, but this year 2,995 have registered from 45 countries. There are 631 French dogs, 530 from Italy and 513 Germans. 

And the competition is gaining an increasingly international flavour with 67 entrants from the United States and four from South Korea, whilst Thailand and Brazil each have two. 

However, those figures are still dwarfed by the 18,432 British entrants.

Since the quarantine laws were changed in 2001, in some cases foreigners have trotted off with the top prize. Best in Show winners include poodle Topscore Contradiction in 2002, from Norway, Australian Shepherd Caitland Isle Take A Chance in 2006 from the USA and in 2009 Sealyham Terrier Efbe's Hidalgo At Goodspice, also from America.

Caroline Kisko of the Kennel Club, which runs Crufts, said: 'There has been a gradual build in the number of overseas dogs since changes to the quarantine laws in 2001.

'The vast majority of people entering know there will be overseas dogs and very much accept the competition.'

Ms Kisko has a pack of 18 Siberian Huskies who she continues to compete with in harness, but her dogs won't be attending Crufts this year. 'I have to work and focus on the event', she said.

She continued: 'We are very proud to welcome to Crufts those dogs and people who are at the top of their game in their own dog related activity.

'Crufts is an event for everybody and there is so much entertainment and information for all dog lovers, helping to inspire new generations of people to take part in activities with their dogs.'

The show has truly been a British institution since its inception in 1891 where three of Queen Victoria's dogs won prizes. The increase in overseas dogs competing is expected to benefit the event, increasing the strength of the competition and raising the status of Crufts on an international s scale.

Crufts will be at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham from March 5-8.
