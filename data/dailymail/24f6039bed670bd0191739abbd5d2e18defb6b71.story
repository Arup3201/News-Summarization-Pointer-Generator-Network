More than half of adults are now expected to get cancer at some point in their life, research shows.

The risk is increasing so quickly that experts fear as many as two-thirds of today’s children will develop the disease.

Charities said yesterday that the NHS could face a ‘crisis’ if it does not plan ahead for the increase in cases.

The warning came after a study found our odds of getting cancer are steadily increasing due to longer lifespans and unhealthy lifestyles.

The projections are the most accurate calculations to date from Cancer Research UK, which had previously estimated that one in three Britons would develop cancer. 

They take into account the effects of modern lifestyles – namely poor diets, lack of exercise, how many of us sunbathe and smoke.

The number of cancer cases is also set to rise due to longer life expectancy and improved healthcare.

BREAST CANCER: 96 per cent of women survive for at least one year, 87 per cent do so for five years, and 78 per cent for a decade.

SKIN CANCER: 88 per cent of men survive for five years or more. For women the figures are even better, with 92 per cent predicted to survive for at least five years.

LUNG CANCER: Just 8 per cent of men survive for five years or more, compared with 12 per cent of women.

PROSTATE CANCER: Some 85 per cent of patients survive for five years or more.

BOWEL CANCER: 59 per cent of men survive for five years or more. For women, the figure is 58 per cent.

The chances of surviving the illness have increased substantially in recent decades thanks to earlier diagnosis and more advanced treatment. At least half of patients can now expect to live for at least ten years, at which point experts say they are effectively cured.

The new figures, published today in the British Journal of Cancer, show the average lifetime risk of getting cancer for anyone born after 1960 is now 50.5 per cent. It is slightly higher for men (at 53.5 per cent, compared with 47.5 per cent for women) because they are more likely to smoke.

The study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, looked at the risk of being diagnosed with cancer for those born between 1930 and 1960.

For the oldest age group the odds were under 40 per cent, but the risk rose steadily with each passing decade.

Professor Peter Sasieni, an expert in cancer trends who is based at Queen Mary University of London, predicted that for today’s children the chances of getting the disease would be about two in three. 

He added: ‘If people live long enough then most will get cancer at some point. But there’s a lot we can do to make it less likely like giving up smoking, being more active, drinking less alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight.’

Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research’s chief executive, warned that if the NHS ‘doesn’t act and invest now’ then ‘we will face a crisis in the future – with [survival rates] going backwards’. However, he added that ‘for some types of cancers we effectively do have a cure’.

‘If you look at testicular cancer we’re up at survival rates in the high nineties now,’ he said.

The latest figures show there are around 331,000 new cases of cancer in the UK each year, most commonly in the lung, breast, prostate and bowel.

Despite improved survival rates, our figures lag well behind those of other European countries. They are particularly low for elderly patients.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Cancer survival rates are now at their highest ever level, and we are on track to save an extra 12,000 lives this year.

‘But cases of cancer are likely to rise with an ageing population – so we are focused on earlier diagnosis, improving care and tackling preventable cancer.’
