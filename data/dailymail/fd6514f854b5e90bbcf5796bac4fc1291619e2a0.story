A South Australian man who admitted to slaughtering six miniature horses has been branded a 'very, very dangerous man' by the distraught owner of the animals.

Julie Jackson said Michael Martin John O'Connell slashed the throats of the horses after a dispute about building work at her horse stud at Clayton Bay, about 70km south of Adelaide.

'He really does deserve to go to jail,' she told reporters outside the Adelaide Magistrates court on Tuesday.

Michael Martin John O'Connell, who slaughtered six miniature horses in December, pleaded guilty to trespassing on Tuesday

On Tuesday O'Connell, 50, pleaded guilty to trespassing, a charge aggravated by his intention to commit a crime.

The crime involved destroying property worth more than $30,000 and his use of an offensive weapon.

In March the Middleton man attended court with a security guard, where he admitted to destroying property.

This charge related to his killing the two colts and four fillies, all aged about two-years-old, in December.

After he admitted to trespassing on Tuesday, prosecutors dropped six counts of ill-treating an animal as a single damage to property charge carries heavier penalties.

Outside court, Ms Jackson said she would love O'Connell to go to jail, describing him as 'a very, very dangerous man'.

Six miniature show horses had their throats slashed by O'Connell over a building dispute at the stables

Since the killings, Ms Jackson and her husband have sold the breeding and show stud stables and moved to another property.

The stables' horse trainer Terry Hocking also called for the jailing of O'Connell, after previously revealing his shock at seeing the six horses with their throats cut.

'I went straight to the first box, of the horse I love dearly, and his throat was slashed,' he said at the time.

'And I went down, and I just kept finding one after another.

'There were three in the box that were very traumatised and we got them out a little later, so it's going to take some time for them to come back to reality,' Mr Hocking said.

Ms Jackson said they had received incredible world-wide public support after the slaughter.

The case was adjourned to the District Court for a sentencing hearing on July 21.
