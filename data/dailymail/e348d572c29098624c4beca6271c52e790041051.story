Elizabeth Bolton had  been the principal legal officer of Burnley Council until she was arrested in 1999 for torching the car of a local authority park keeper

A lawyer's wife who was spared jail for fire-bombing a car amid an obsession with a teenage girl, has been caught stealing thousands of pounds from the council she works for. 

Former Girls Brigade chief Elizabeth Bolton had once been the principal legal officer of Burnley Council until she was arrested in 1999 for torching the car of a local authority park keeper.

She was appointed clerk to Padiham Town Council, Lancashire, despite warnings over her arson conviction which at the time was said to have arisen out of her obsession with the worker's teenage girlfriend.

But after being given her second chance, Bolton secretly overpaid herself by almost £12,000 over a four year period when she was working 22 hours a week at the council.

Her scam was only discovered after an audit was carried out following her resignation.

At Burnley Crown Court, Bolton, 59, sobbed as she admitted fraud between January 1, 2007 and December 29, 2011 but walked free after a judge said it was 'appropriate' she should be punished in the community.

She was supported in court by her husband Peter - a conveyancing lawyer - and members of a local Methodist church where she attends services.

Inquiries revealed the attack had arisen out of Bolton's 'almost unhealthy obsession' with the then 34-year old council employee's teenage girlfriend. Bolton had been taking an intense interest in the girl's welfare, taking her on holidays and encouraging her academically and got her a holiday in a local park as she awaited her A level results.

But Bolton was said to be furious when she learnt the girl had fallen for the park keeper whose marriage was in difficulties at the time and she caught them embracing in a hut.

After engineering his sacking, Bolton then carried out the arson attack whilst the man parked his car outside the girl's parents' house. He looked out of a bedroom window, to see a flash and flames engulfing the side of his vehicle.

Dashing out, he kicked away a petrol-filled bleach bottle. He found Bolton about to drive off in her car, still wearing rubber gloves and smelling of petrol, and wrestled her to the ground.

In 2001 at Lancaster Crown Court she was given a 12 month suspended jail term after admitting arson. Charges of indecent assault were allowed to lie on file.

But despite the scandal, Bolton was appointed the following year to her £15,000 a year job managing the affairs of Padiham Town Council.

At the time councillors questioned her appointment voicing fears Padiham Town Hall would be left without fire insurance due to her conviction but the then mayor of Padiham Granville Lord said: 'Mrs Bolton was selected for her knowledge of local government. We had some excellent candidates and she came out the best qualified person for the position.

'We were fully aware of Mrs Bolton's past, but I do not think we should sit as judge and jury on someone's past life.'

Speaking at the time, Mrs Bolton said: 'I just want to make a fresh start. People know about what happened and I can't change what I did, which was unfortunate.'

She was one of only two paid employees at the council and was responsible for arranging payment of wages to both herself and the caretaker and looking after the town council's finances. But from 2005 onwards, she arranged that she would be paid a gross wage instead of net.

Bolton disguised the shortfall transferred money from one of two charity accounts held by the the council into the council's main account as the tax year end approached. After the tax year concluded, she would then 'reverse' that payment by repaying the relevant charity fund from the main account, leaving a net shortfall in the main account.

Bolton then paid money in from other sources, including her own account, to make good, but from March 2008, she didn't make enough payments and the money owed began to ' almost run away with itself.' By the time she resigned in May 2012, the net overpayment was £11,696.

Prosecutor Adam Watkins said: 'She was given a very considerable degree of autonomy and there were few, if any, checks conducted upon her.'

In mitigation defence counsel Miss Katherine Pierpoint said: 'This shouldn't have happened. She's embarrassed it has happened. She apologises for that behaviour and she knows she must be dealt with by the court today.'

The barrister said Bolton had struggled with mental health problems for a number of years. She had had help in the past and her mental health was particularly poor when she left her job. The defendant had a problem with alcohol.

Bolton had recently started cognitive behavioural therapy. Miss Pierpoint added: 'She is dealing with her problems properly and it may well be that her mental health now is a lot better than it had been previously.'

Bolton received 10 months in jail, suspended for two years, with a 22 week, 9pm to 7am curfew and must attend the Lancashire Women's Specified Activity Requirement. She was ordered to pay £1,000 costs. The hearing was told the money has been paid back - with interest.

Judge Jonathan Gibson told her : 'You have, of course, a significant mental disorder and you are taking steps to deal with it. I think you can be appropriately punished in the community for what you did.'
