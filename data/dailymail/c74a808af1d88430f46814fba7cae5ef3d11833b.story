This is the moment a female tiger appeared to offer a high-five to a tourist.

The two-year-old animal was captured performing the motion at Tierpark Hagenbeck Zoo in Hamburg, Germany, today.

She can be seen raising her paw up in the air, before placing it flatly against the glass wall of her enclosure.

And the male visitor certainly doesn't leave her hanging - holding his own hand up against the other side of the glass.

The incredible photo was taken by another visitor at the zoo, which is known for being the first facility to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than cages, for certain animals.

Following her high-five, the tigress can be seen raising her other paw against the glass as the man and his daughter beam in delight.

She balances on her rear legs as she touches the transparent barrier - showing off her white-and-black underbelly.

Magnificent: The massive animal was caught on camera by another tourist at the zoo in Hamburg, Germany

And the animal, who was recently transferred from Novosibirsk Zoo in Russia, does not seem to tire of trying to make new friends.

She spends the rest of the day strolling backward and forward within inches of the glass wall - much to the delight of several young visitors.

At one point, she even rests her head against the glass as a boy reaches out as if to stroke her fur.
