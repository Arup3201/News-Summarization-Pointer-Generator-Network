Lewis Hamilton shared a picture on Monday night of himself posing with the Monster Energy girls before the image mysteriously disappeared.

The F1 world champion posted the picture to his Instagram and Twitter accounts only for the links to become unavailable a couple of hours later.

Hamilton was snapped with the scantily clad women, who represent the energy drink brand Monster, at the Monza Rally Show in November but only posted the image six weeks after the event.

'At the Monza Rally Show a couple of months back with the @MonsterEnergy girls!' Hamilton posted on Twitter alongside the photo.

The smiling two-time champion is seen flanked by three girls either side of him, as two more beauties kneel in front of him.

Hamilton attended the three-day show just before being crowned the 2014 drivers' champion after winning the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi.
