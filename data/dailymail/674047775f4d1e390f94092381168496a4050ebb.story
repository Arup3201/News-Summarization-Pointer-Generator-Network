The FA has confirmed that England will travel to Italy for a friendly on Tuesday March 31 2015, with the venue still to be decided.

A return fixture will then take place at Wembley between 2016 and 2018, prior to the  World Cup in Russia.

The March fixture could see striker Mario Balotelli lining up against Liverpool team-mates such as Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson but he will have to get back in the Azzurri squad first after being omitted by new boss Antonio Conte.

Mario Balotelli scored the winner the last time the sides met - a 2-1 win for Italy at the World Cup

Fellow Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge scored for England in that match and the pair could face each other in the friendly scheduled for March

The last time the two sides met was at this summer's World Cup in Brazil when Italy won 2-1 courtesy of goals from Balotelli and Claudio Marchisio either side of  Sturridge's equaliser.

England manager Roy Hodgson said of the friendly: 'Italy have always provided stern opposition for England and these two fixtures will be no different. Italian teams are always set up very well and they have a great history of producing world class footballers. It will give us great preparation leading into major international tournaments.

The last time Italy hosted England was in 2000, with the Azzurri winning 1-0 through a Gennaro Gattuso goal

'After managing in Italy with Inter, it will be a fantastic experience for me personally to go back to Italy and manage England.'

It is 14 years since England's last visit to Italy – they were defeated 1-0 on that occasion by a Gennaro Gattuso strike at Stadio Delle Alpi in David Beckham's first game as captain of his country.
