It has spent more than a decade in the sky, carting almost every Australian from the prime minister to the Socceroos.

Now, after 29 years of service, the last of the Qantas Boeing 767 planes is being retired.

Passengers on the plane's final flight from Melbourne to Sydney on Saturday were treated to bubbly, a flyover of the Sydney Harbour and a water cannon salute at take-off and landing in homage to the trusty aircraft's service to Australian passengers.

Captain Mike Galvin, Boeing 767 pilot and Qantas flying operations head, said it was the end of an era.

'It's a great day for aviation in Australia,' he told reporters on board the trusty aircraft before its final departure.

'There's a lot of nostalgia associated with this very last flight.

'It's an end of an era but the start of something new.'

Mr Galvin said the plane, once the workhorse of the fleet, had served passengers well but would now be sold into another carrier and flown to the US in January.

Qantas acquired the 767s in 1985, with the retiring model joining at the end of 1991. In that time, the wide body aircraft has done 86,000 flying hours.

'That's over ten-and-a-half years airborne and it's done 27,000 landings,' Mr Galvin said.

'It doesn't owe us anything, that's for sure.'

At one stage there were 41 Boeing 767s in the Qantas fleet. In is estimated that during that time, 168 million passengers have flown on a Qantas 767 aircraft.

'So, almost every Australian who's flown on a Qantas aeroplane would've flown on one of these particular aircraft in that time,' Mr Galvin said.

'We've had some great times.'

The aircraft has carried Australian prime ministers, the Socceroos team, the Wallabies and the Australian cricket team. 

They will now be replaced by newer more advanced and fuel efficient aircraft.
