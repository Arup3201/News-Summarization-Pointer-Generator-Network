A gang of yobs who fired a 'BB gun' in the street came face-to-face with the real thing when armed police swooped on them armed with submachine guns.

The two boys and three girls sparked terror in Plymouth city centre when they were spotted brandishing the gun - which reportedly looked like a pistol - and began shooting at a building.

But they soon had problems of their own after 999 operators sent in police marksmen armed with Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine-guns - capable of firing up to 800 rounds-per-minute - to arrest them.

Operation: This was the moment machine-gun wielding cops swooped on an 'armed' teen gang - only to find their weapon was actually a BB gun

Careful: An armed officer keeps guard with his weapon as police search the gang on the floor

Fears: The group of two boys and three girls sparked fears after brandishing the weapon - reported to resemble a pistol - and began shooting

Officers pinned the youngsters down and handcuffed them before establishing the weapon only shoots ball bearings.

The scenes were captured by professional cameraman Patrick Bishop, 45, who was walking past when the swoop unfolded.

He said: 'A police car came to a screaming stop, two officers got out armed with guns and I just reached for my mobile phone.

Contained: Officers pinned the youngsters down and cuffed them before establishing that the fake weapon posed no threat

Response: The forceful response demonstrates how seriously the police treat reports of the use of firearms

Aftermath: Police clear up as the youngsters are taken away. Devon and Cornwall police have warned others against the use of firearms

'By the time I'd got it ready they had the kids on the floor. I know they have to take firearm reports seriously, but it was still a shock because it's not normally something you see in the centre of Plymouth.'

Following the incident on January 10 three girls were later returned home and the two boys, both aged 17, were arrested on suspicion of a public order offence.

One was dealt with by restorative justice while no action was taken against the other. Devon and Cornwall Police issued a warning that anyone carrying weapons - fake or real - would be dealt with by armed officers.
