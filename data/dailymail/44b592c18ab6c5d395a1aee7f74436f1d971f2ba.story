Formula E racing driver Nick Heidfeld had a lucky escape during a race in Beijing as the German was sent flying into heavy barriers after a collision with Nicolas Prost.

Heidfeld, who raced in Formula 1 between 2000 and 2011, tried to overtake Prost but appeared to be clipped by the Frenchman's car.

His car spiralled out of control before crashing into heavy barriers and overturning - leaving watching spectators worried about his health.

However Heidfeld had no major injuries from the collision and even ran to confront Prost after the crash.

The 37-year-old said after the race: 'Thankfully I’m okay. It surprised me that it didn’t hurt more.

'I pulled alongside Nico before the last corner and for there rest there was nothing I could do.'

Prost could now be the subject of an investigation by The Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) if they feel he deliberatly nudged Heidfeld's car.

However Prost has refuted claims he veered into Heidfeld on purpose: 'I didn’t see him and it is disappointing to lose the victory like this. I was in the middle of the track when I braked for the corner, just to be safe.

'But he was next to me and already hit my wheel. I didn’t think he would try something like this. There is no way to overtake there.'
