Laboratory workers in the US have come up with a novel solution for those who hate scrubbing floors.

They have used liquid nitrogen to eradicate of dust and blemishes on the floor of their office in Sugar Land, Texas.

However, this is one science experiment that should be left up to the experts.

Fun with science: Workers at a laboratory in Texas used liquid nitrogen to dust the floor at their office

The laboratory workers had some liquid nitrogen left over after filling tank and they decided to see what would happen when they splashed it on the floor.

This one-minute video shows one of the employees, wearing protective gloves, dumping the contents of a plastic bucket, setting off a cascade of fog.

The fog is accompanied by a sizzling noise as spots of dirt appear to boil.

The camera shows dirt bubbling on the floor like butter in a hot pan.

With an extremely low temperature of nearly -200C, liquid nitrogen freezes anything it touches and has a variety of uses.

For example, doctors use it to kill cancerous tissue, chefs use it to prepare certain dishes in the kitchen, and farmers use it to brand cattle.
