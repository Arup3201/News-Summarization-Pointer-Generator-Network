Arsene Wenger has attempted to lure Iker Casillas away from Real Madrid as the Arsenal boss looks for a new No 1 at the Emirates.

According to reports in Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo, Wenger has called the goalkeeper to convince him to join Arsenal.

Casillas fell behind Diego Lopez as Real Madrid's man between the sticks in La Liga last season, but was still Carlo Ancelotti's first choice in their Champions League-winning run.

The Spanish press are claiming the Premier League is Casillas' favoured destination, and after a disappointing World Cup campaign with the national side, the 33-year-old may be looking for a fresh start.

Wenger is on the lookout for a new
 keeper with Wojciech Szczesny the only first-team stopper at the club after the departure
 of Lukasz Fabianski to Swansea.

Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall, Colombian international David Ospina and Mexican Guillermo Ochoa have all been linked with the No 1 spot at Arsenal this summer.

Casillas has 156 caps for Spain, and has played 678 games for Real Madrid in his 15-year stint at the Bernabeu.Â
