Ally McCoist insisted the perilous financial position at Rangers does not make him immune from the sack.

But the Ibrox boss remains confident he can overcome current criticism and fulfil his remit by guiding the club back into top-flight football.

McCoist has been on the receiving end of heavy flak after Monday evening’s grim 3-1 home defeat from Hibernian left Rangers six points adrift of Hearts.

Ally McCoist claims that no manager is completely safe from losing his job

Some fans have questioned whether the settlement package due on his current £400,000 per year earnings simply makes his dismissal too expensive for the board to consider.

The Ibrox outfit were forced to launch a stop-gap £3.13million share issue last month and could face another cash shortfall by the end of the year.

But McCoist said: ‘I don’t think anyone is bombproof. I wouldn’t sit here for a minute and say I’m bombproof. I’m still wearing the flak jacket but nobody is bombproof.’

Asked if suggestions that he was only still in place for financial reasons were hurtful, McCoist replied: ‘I don’t find that insulting at all. I don’t necessarily agree with it. I don’t think there has ever been a manager at all who hasn’t been sackable.

‘So I don’t think about that at all and it doesn’t annoy me that people have said it. I’ve got far too much on my mind, concentrating on the positives and moving forward.’

Former players and pundits have delivered scathing critiques of McCoist’s tenure this week, with ex-Hearts midfielder Michael Stewart accusing him of failing to coach his players properly.

‘I am not going to sit here and tell you it’s enjoyable when you are getting stick,’ said the 52-year-old, who declined to address any individual remarks.

‘Of course it’s not. But I have a real acceptance that it goes with the territory. If Walter Smith can get Nine-In-A-Row, get to the UEFA Cup final and get dog’s abuse then it is fair to say that we will get our fair share of criticism. I just want to get the job done.’

The Hibs reverse followed an earlier victory for Hearts at Ibrox, but McCoist sees no need for panic as he takes his team to Livingston this afternoon.

‘I accept that criticism is going to come with the two defeats,’ he said. ‘But it is my job to do something about that. We are less than a fifth into the season. There are miles and miles to go.

‘It is important that we don’t get carried away after good performances. And I am not going to get too upset after a 3-1 defeat at home to Hibs. I made a point of checking and, in 2010, we had a team that had nine guys who played in the UEFA Cup final that lost 3-0 to Hibs at home. Three years before, Ivan Sproule scored a hat-trick for Hibs in another 3-0 loss.

‘Now that is not a fob-off. We were beaten 3-1, we had a mad 20 minutes, we need to do something about it. But it is not unique.

‘There is nothing that’s happened this season which has shocked us. We knew right from the word go it was a step up.’

The Championship play-offs would provide a back-up option if Rangers fail to close the gap on Hearts.

‘Getting out of the division is the most important thing,’ added McCoist. ‘We will take whatever we can to get out of this division because it is so important for the club to get back into the top flight as soon as possible.’
