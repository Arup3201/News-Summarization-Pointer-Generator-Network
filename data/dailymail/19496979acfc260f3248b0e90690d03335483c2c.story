Going anywhere fast can be a near impossible experience for many drivers in Ukraine.

The country's road network is a mass of gaping caverns caused by ever-expanding pot holes.

A video posted on YouTube has revealed how much drivers are forced to slow down as they navigate a bumpy road  connecting two major Ukrainian cities.

Cars can be seen weaving in and out and switching to the other side of the road in an attempt to avoid a tyre blowout.

At one point a lorry is on the same path as the car which is filming the road and comes perilously close.

The road was apparently reconstructed a few years ago in preparation for Ukraine hosting Euro 2012.

Temperature
changes and the huge amount of snow on the roads cause melting water 
to penetrate the country's poorly constructed roads, creating gaping holes of 
various sizes.

Although driving through the capital Kyiv’s main 
thoroughfares is relatively easy, the problems begin for drivers outside
these well-surfaced and signposted routes.

A series of roads were revamped for the Euro 2012 last year after Ukraine was one of the host nations.

Despite recent developments, much of 
Ukraine's appearance is still very much dominated by reminders of its 
Soviet past - everything from the buildings and the roads to the parks 
and the  
infrastructure was created by the Soviet Union.

Condition: Generally, roads in Ukraine outside major urban areas are in poor condition and are poorly lit

There are many towns that look almost the same as before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. 

But change is still pushing forward and this month Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov instructed the government to focus on repairs of roads in Ukraine.

'We should focus our resources and 
efforts on immediate repairs of the most damaged areas,' he said at a 
meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.

Ukraine plans to build about 2,000 km of roads in 2013-2018, according to the Kyiv Post.

Roads will have appropriate road infrastructure, the press service of the Infrastructure Ministry has said.

Nearly 30,000 km of public roads, mainly those leading to the major cities, as well as the highways with the most intensive vehicular traffic, will be repaired.
