A man has built a Del Boy version of the famous flying car Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

John Rothwell spent three years constructing the world's first three-wheeled replica using the frame of a Reliant Rialto - similar to the car used in Only Fools and Horses.

The 51-year-old, who is a big fan of the film, which is based on the children's book by Bond creator Ian Fleming, spent about £4,000 converting the car, which comes complete with wings.

Movie magic: Dick Van Dyke in the original Chitty Chitty Bang Bang car from the movie of the same name which came out in 1968 and was based on Ian Fleming's book Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The magical Car

After buying the Reliant Rialto for about £800, Mr Rothwell spent days days stripping the vehicle back to its chassis in May 2011.

He then bought pine to build the frame of the car and 30 strips of red cedar from a fencing company for £300 to make the new body. The boat was made using plywood, using 27, 8ft lengths he cut by hand.

The vehicles engine was stripped and re-built and new brakes were fitted and it was converted to an electronic ignition. 

Mr Rothwell made the wings using fabric usually used to make bouncy castles and used electric window motors to motorise them, at a cost of around £190.

Carpet was added, for £80, and several hundred more was spent on brass and aluminium to give the vehicle a shiny finish.  

Humble beginnings: He built the car using the frame of a Reliant Rialto - like the car used in Only Fools and Horses - which is seen above

Used for parts: He stripped the paneling off the vehicle and spent around £4,000 converting it into a roadworthy version of the vehicle

Bare beginnings: The Reliant Rialto was purchased for £800 and stripped back to its chassis; Mr Rothwell made 120 trips from his home to a council rented garage where he made the car between 2011 and 2014; he completed the job unassisted

Winging it: Mr Rothwell made the wings using fabric usually used to make bouncy castles and used electric window motors to motorise them, at a cost of around £190

The car has even passed its MOT and is now fully legal to drive on the road.

Mr Rothwell, from Cambridge, said: 'I've always liked the film and a few years ago I joked with my friends that one day I'd build a trike version of the Chitty car and now I have.'

Mr Rothwell, a jeweller by trade, said building the car was a 'steep learning curve', something not helped by the fact he didn't have any designs to go on.

He said: I've never even seen the original in real life, so my trike is based completely on pictures from the Internet.'

Mr Rothwell built the car on the framework of a Reliant Rialto in a garage rented from the council, travelling back and fourth from his home 120 times between 2011 and 2014. He completed the job unassisted. 

He said: 'I've never done anything like this before, but I learnt how to do everything, including the upholstery, welding and weather beating.'

Mr Rothwell said driving the vehicle brings joy to more than just him.  

He said: 'We've been out in it a few times now and it's lovely to watch people faces and see them smile as I drive past.'

Dream come true: Mr Rothwell, from Cambridge, said: 'I've always liked the film and a few years ago I joked with my friends that one day I'd build a trike version of the Chitty car and now I have'

A joy to drive: 'We've been out in it a few times now and it's lovely to watch people faces and see them smile as I drive past'

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang tells the story of an inventor who finds success with a flying car

Mr Rothwell, who works as an occupational therapy assistant at Addenbrooke's Hospital and teaches evening classes in jewellery, still has some finishing touches to add to the car.

He plans to put a visible exhaust pipe on the side, a spare wheel on the front and make the wings motorised.

Mr Rothwell hopes it will be completely finished by Easter and plans to take it to shows to raise money for the Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust.

His partner Alison added: 'It has been a brilliant project and it's a lovely car to go out in.'

The film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, which was released in 1968 and stars Dick Van Dyke, tells the story of an inventor who finds success with a flying car.
