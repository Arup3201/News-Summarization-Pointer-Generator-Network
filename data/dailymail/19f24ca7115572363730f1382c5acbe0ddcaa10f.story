Roy Hodgson has been manager of England since May 2012. He is a figure who divides opinions; for some he is a quiet voice of sanity amid the prevailing madness, for others he is a bland, uninspiring presence.

All agree, however, that Hodgson is an instinctively courteous man who controls temper and tongue whatever the provocation. Now, it seems, we shall all have to think again.

The eruption occurred during his spirited defence of England’s midweek performance against Norway.

Fuse: Roy Hodgson hit out at the press following the 1-0 win over Norway at Wembley on Wednesday

Boss: Hodgson saw the positives in the performance, complaining that the media are always turning the knife

His critics having scented blood during the World Cup campaign, Hodgson believes that they are seizing every chance to turn the knife. The sparking point was a questioner’s tendentious use of a statistic. The manager snarled. ‘I can’t turn the clock back,’ he said.

‘But what I can do is analyse what I have seen and judge that through my eyes and not because someone is telling me: “Well, you only had two shots at goal.” Because, for me, that is absolute f****** b*******. I’m sorry.’

From many managers, such an outburst would be unremarkable (not for nothing was Joe Kinnear known as ‘JFK’ during his brief, inglorious spell at Newcastle). But from Hodgson, at an on-the-record Press conference, it was startling. And it may come to be seen as the turning point in his England career.

For the past two years, Hodgson has been at pains to please all and sundry. He has appeared determined to give no offence, to offer no harsh or contentious opinions. His approach has been scrupulously even-handed: ‘On the one hand; but, then again, on the other.’

As a result of that — and of his admirable reluctance to indulge in touchline histrionics — he has been accused of lacking ‘passion’, that preposterously over-rated quality which English football holds so dear.

Now some of his colleagues would have amended that impression by courting the media. It is a well-trodden path; the gushing phone call, the chummy text, the flattering implication that the scribbler’s opinion is warmly valued.

Why, there are managers who have built their careers upon such methods, but Hodgson is not of that number. So far as I am aware, he has bestowed no favours, played no favourites, incurred no obligations. Which leaves him in a remarkably strong position.

Reaction: Wembley was half-empty on Wednesday night after a disappointing World Cup campaign

Had enough? Midfielder Jack Wilshere (right) also hit out at criticism of his personal performances

His England contract runs through to the European Championship finals of 2016. The qualifying hurdles are Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino; barring calamity, all should be cleared with something to spare. 

Back then: The press wanted Bobby Robson out after a 1-1 draw with Saudi Arabia in 1988

The pool of English talent is shallow, since our game prizes domestic greed above international need, but as Hodgson argued the other evening, we have an elite corps of players which is clearly capable of something significant. 

The manager cited the likes of Jordan Henderson, Jack Wilshere and Daniel Sturridge.

He added the substitutes Fabian Delph, Danny Welbeck and Calum Chambers, and mentioned absentees Luke Shaw, Ross Barkley and Adam Lallana.

He paid particular tribute to the dazzling young Raheem Sterling, aware that his main problem there will involve management of expectations. 

Had he been able to identify some adequate central defenders, his case might have been even stronger. But no matter: the point was well taken.

So the scene is invitingly set, and I suspect that Hodgson is in the mood to answer the invitation.

Already, he has brought qualities of dignity and intelligence to the task, and all the signs suggest that his players appreciate his methods. Likewise the public, whose loyalty has been unstinting.

A half–empty Wembley provoked many a glib sneer last week, and yet, as an expression of public optimism, a gate of 40,000 was quite staggering. 

The next move lies with the manager, and there is at least one encouraging precedent for his situation.

Change in mood: Robson on the bench with England boss in 1988, before his fortune changed

Heroes: Robson then took England to the World Cup in Italy in 1990, putting in a passionate performance

Twenty-six years ago, Bobby Robson’s England team reached the Euro 88 finals, where they were beaten in the group stage by the Republic of Ireland, Holland and the USSR. 

The ensuing abuse was savagely hysterical. The side came home and played out a sterile draw in a friendly with Saudi Arabia, whereupon one crass headline bellowed: ‘In the name of Allah, go!’

Two years later, Robson led his team to Italia 90. Improving game by game, they reached the semi-finals, where they lost a cruelly close battle on penalties to West Germany. Robson was established as by far the best and most successful England manager since Sir Alf Ramsey, but he never forgot the pain he had suffered, and how he had coped.

Another era: Paul Gascoigne, one of England's finest performers at Italia '90, playing in the semi-final

Years later — knighted, feted and installed as a national treasure — he told me how he had decided to be his own man, to stand or fall by his own decisions. Then he said something profound: ‘I remember thinking: “If I’m going to have regrets, then they’ve got to be for the things I did, not for the things I didn’t do.” Does that make sense?’ He was a wise man, was Bobby, and it was wisdom born of painful experience.

Roy Hodgson has suffered a little of the pain while accumulating a similar store of experience. He has been offered the chance to become one of England’s most memorable managers. Now he must seize it.

Slotted: Wayne Rooney puts away the penalty - the only goal of the game - in the sterile win against Norway

Don’t worry Wayne, it’s just a strip of cloth

The choice of Wayne Rooney as England captain was not universally popular.

Some worried that the responsibility might prove inhibiting and that his form might suffer.

In the event, the armband made not a scrap of difference. Rooney worked as hard as ever in the match against Norway but his touch was wayward, his efforts unproductive and a game which once came so easily to him now seemed a murky mystery.

Just a title: Rooney captained England on Wednesday night, but the armband made no difference

When he departed, in the 69th minute, he appeared uncertain what to do with the band. He looked around, spotted Gary Cahill nearby and hastily passed it on. It would be good to report that Cahill was inspired by his call to the colours. 

In truth, he simply carried on making the same mistakes he had been making all evening, before thrusting it at Joe Hart with six minutes remaining. The transactions evoked images of harassed mothers handing over a screeching infant.

There are those who cling to the caricature of captaincy, the peculiarly English myth of the fist-shaking skipper, rallying his troops by the force of his personality. That delusion perished when Roy Race hung up his boots at Melchester Rovers. 

Put it in: Rooney in training ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland

We now accept that the captain is required to predict the toss of a coin and make a choice of ends. But we resist pretentious attempts to mystify the office. For we know that the reality of football captaincy can be quite different.

And that it can involve three embarrassed young men, hurriedly exchanging a shabby bauble. Because convention insists that somebody has to be nominally ‘in charge’; his authority signified by a strip of cloth.

Gatlin the problem for Greg 

Greg Rutherford, Britain’s Olympic long jump champion, fears for the future of track and field. With competitions dwindling and public interest fading, he calls for urgent action.

‘There has to be a way of showcasing athletics to make it more fun,’ says Rutherford. He believes there should be more street events, such as Gateshead’s excellent Great North CityGames, and he makes a strong case.

But on the very day that he expressed his worries, a cheat named Justin Gatlin ran the 100 metres in 9.77 secs, the fastest time of the year.

Gatlin is free to compete, despite having served two bans for the use of illegal drugs and his presence is an unacceptable disgrace.

For until the public can believe what it is watching, honourable men like Rutherford will be cruelly handicapped in their struggle to save a great sport.

Triumph: Gatlin recorded a years best time of 9.77s in Brussels on Friday evening

PS

When Lewis Hamilton was asked why his Mercedes team-mate, Nico Rosberg, was so desperate to beat him, he answered: ‘It’s because I’m good-looking, man. I’ve got the car, I’ve got the girlfriend. What can I say?’ 

There are times when I wonder why I find it impossible to take Formula One as seriously as it takes itself. I suspect that the self–effacing Hamilton has just supplied the answer.
