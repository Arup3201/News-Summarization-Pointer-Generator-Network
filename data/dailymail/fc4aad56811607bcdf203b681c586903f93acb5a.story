Professional chefs spend hours perfecting the presentation of dishes, but one photographer has revealed the unseen beauty of food that hides deep within these restaurant meals. 

Austin-based Ajay Malghan thinly slices and flattens food between panes of glass and photographs them by manipulating background light and colour. 

He states his images of potatoes, broccoli, melon, and more resemble supernovas in space, or the vascular system in the human body.

The images were taken by Austin-based Ajay Malghan for his project Naturally Modified.

Malghan began by painting lettuce, using different shades and colours. 

Following the Fukushima disaster, he used neon paints and contrasting hues to represent the radiation seeping into the ground.

The background and colour is manipulated using light shone from behind, and ink within the panes.

His images include melons, tomatoes, potatoes, carrots, broccoli and more.

The project is called Naturally Modified.

‘Food, as well as being what we live off of, is my art. It’s what I work with,’ explained Malghan in The Secret Within documentary, produced by Whole Food’s magazine Dark Rye. 

‘Something so simple can be so complex. There are so many layers to it; we always have this intimate experience with it, but we don’t know anything about it.'

‘I thought it was quite fascinating that you can take something you have an extremely familiar relationship with, and manipulate it in a minor way but one that completely removes you from any context you were familiar with,’ he continued. 

He admitted the images that were the most difficult to get flat, or to slice or get the fluid out of were the most rewarding, including watermelon.

Malghan said the thing that struck him the most as he worked with the food was the similarities to other objects in the universe, such as space and MRI scans. 

‘You start seeing common threads in the universe, you start understanding through how little you know, you want to learn more.’

Malghan also compares the food to the human body. For example, he claims tomatoes are just bags of cells, like our bodies, and his images of watermelons, and corn remind him of the vascular system. 

When he exhibits his artwork, he deliberately doesn’t include labels ‘because that generates a conversation; people have to ask, and talk about the process.’ 

‘A lot of the time, some people view art with a label first and that ruined it for me.’

An example Malghan gives in The Space Within documentary is an image of an orange he exhibited in Hong Kong that was purple.

Many of Malghan's image resembles images from space, such as this shot of Cassiopeia A, a false colour image created using observations from the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes. It is a supernova remnant found 11,000 light years from Earth in the Milky Way

A woman told him she could see people dancing in the painting, while another saw fire. Malghan admitted that these differences and insights ‘blew his mind’

However, he didn’t see the beauty in all foods. 

‘My relationship with fast food really changed after photographing it,’ said Malghan, ‘because I had to have my hands in it for an extended period of time- but [it’s] just an amorphous blob.  

‘There was no definition. Beef came from a cow, so it should have something that tells you what it was before, so after doing that I don’t eat cheeseburgers any more.’ 

Malghan concluded: ‘We usually just take food on the surface, we don’t usually question anything. [This] makes me more curious.’
