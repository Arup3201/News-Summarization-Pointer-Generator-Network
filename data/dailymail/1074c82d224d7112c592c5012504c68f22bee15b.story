A gadget has been invented to solve the age-old problem of tea and coffee drinkers over-dunking their biscuits and losing them to the bottom of their mug.

The small plastic device acts like a reservoir and sits inside a mug, immersed in the drink.

It is held in position by a magnet that is attached to the outside of the cup and can be lowered as the user drinks.

The drinker dunks their biscuit into the one inch deep holder in the middle of the cup, safe in the knowledge that any biscuit loss is contained in the gadget and is easily recoverable.

The Dunkin' Buddy measures 3cm wide and 5.7cm long - the perfect size for most biscuits including Oreos and ginger creams (pictured) as well as digestives, bourbons and cookies

They can even leave the baked snack in the drink-filled holder until it is dunked to their satisfaction or depending on how robust the biscuit is.

The invention, called the 'Dunkin' Buddy' takes out the frenetic rush of finding a teaspoon and trying to fish out your biscuit before the hot drink turns it into a sludgy mess.

It measures 3cm wide and 5.7cm long - the perfect size for most biscuits including digestives and cookies.

The 'Dunkin' Buddy' was invented by Jason Wells, 31, and Kiana Machnicz, 21, both from Connecticut.

Mr Wells said: 'We came up with the idea after watching TV and dunking biscuits into our drinks."The Dunkin' Buddy solves many problems associated with biscuit dunking.

The reservoir-like device can also be used to dunk sweet treats in milk

'It not only means the user does not have to hold each biscuit while being dunked but also saves them from breaking and falling into the bottom of the cup.

'It also stops having to jam your hand in the bottom of the cup when your biscuit does break."The drinker can also dunk biscuits and leave them for a while - depending on how robust the biscuit is - while doing things like playing games or using the computer.

'It works by using two neodymium magnets, one in the handle, and the other one in the tray itself.

'This allows the user to control the tray inside the cup by simply sliding the handle located on the outside in any direction they desire.

'The Dunkin' Buddy works with almost any cup or mug located in the kitchen.

'It can fit one or two cookies inside of it, depending on their size.'

The inventors have posted the 'Dunkin' Buddy' on fundraising website Kickstarter and hope to raise 6,000 pounds to start the manufacturing process.

They expect each model will cost around six pounds to buy when they are sold.
