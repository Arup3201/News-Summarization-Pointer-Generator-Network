There were three winners at the end of a Canadian Grand Prix that sparkled as brightly as the Colgate-advert smile of the man standing on the top step of the podium: Daniel Ricciardo.

Another victor was Nico Rosberg, who extended his championship lead to 22 points over his unfortunate Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton, who retired with mechanical failure when vying for the lead of the race.

The final triumph was for Formula One itself. The Gilles Villeneuve circuit, as it so often does, delivered an abundance of drama on the sun-kissed tarmac next to the Olympic rowing lake.

5. Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) - 60

But we should return to congratulate 
Ricciardo, who had a podium finish in his home race in Melbourne in 
March taken from him because his team broke fuel flow regulations.

On Sunday, told over the radio that he had won, he simply said: ‘Wow.’

Half-collecting
 his thoughts during the ceremony he said: ‘I’m still in shock. This is 
ridiculous. It is a bit surreal. It’s not that we were leading the race 
from start to finish.’

Too
 right. Nothing was that simple. The dramatic start set the tone. 
Rosberg, beginning on pole, was not away as quickly as Hamilton. But the
 German had the positional advantage to hold his team-mate off at the 
first, tight left-hander. Hamilton lost second place to Red Bull’s 
Sebastian Vettel, who ended up third. Race over? Not a bit of it.

More
 drama ensued just moments later involving Marussia. What a difference a
 fortnight made for them. In Monaco they celebrated their first point in
 a four-and-a-half year history through Jules Bianchi’s ninth place. But
 neither of their cars made the end of the first lap here, as Bianchi 
and Max Chilton collided, leaving a smear of oil on the track that 
brought out the safety car for six laps.

The
 accident ended the world’s least spectacular record: Chilton’s streak 
of 25 unbroken finishes stretching back to his debut in Melbourne last 
season.

Soon Hamilton had 
passed Vettel using the DRS boost. At this stage both Mercedes were 
struggling slightly on their supersoft tyres but still lapped quicker 
than everybody else by dint of their superior engines.

After
 18 laps, Rosberg came in. It was a smooth stop of 3.1sec. He was 
followed by Hamilton, delayed half a second longer in the pit box. 
Rosberg rode the kerbs high at the first chicane and nearly wobbled off.

Hamilton
 pulled closer and closer to Rosberg’s exhaust over the following 
minutes, turning the timing screens purple, the colour that denotes 
fastest sectors and laps.

Rosberg
 could see Hamilton getting bigger in his mirrors and, under pressure, 
missed the apex of turn 14, cutting the corner. The stewards issued a 
final warning.

Damage: The remains of Massa's Williams is dragged away from the circuit by a recovery vehicle

Problems: Both Mercedes drivers reported a lack of power midway through the race

It was 
probably the right decision on balance: Rosberg had gained time but not a
 place. It would have been harsh to order the German to cede the 
position.

Hamilton, who 
harried Rosberg for much of the race, started to fall away around the 
middle of the 70 laps, before he complained over the radio: ‘I am losing
 power guys.’ We then learned that Rosberg was suffering the same 
affliction.

Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman in his trademark red cap, wore a worried look in the team’s paddock home.

A
 ship’s horn sounded — like a warning in the St Lawrence River on which 
this island track stands — and well it might. The trauma had barely 
started for the Silver Arrows, who instructed both their drivers to 
reset their systems. Rosberg was told: ‘We don’t think we can resolve 
it. You need to  pick up the pace. P3 (the third –placed car) is 
catching us now.’

Bold: Hamilton tried to jump Rosberg into the first corner but went in too deep

Squeezed off: Hamilton ended up falling behind Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel on the first lap

All gone wrong: Hamilton was forced to retire with over 20 laps of the race remaining

The two 
Mercedes came in for their second stops. Rosberg’s stop was slower than 
that of Hamilton, who came out in the lead. It was short-lived as 
Rosberg passed him. Hamilton fought back but missed the apex at the same
 spot as Rosberg had and had to let his rival back through.

It
 was chaos now. Hamilton, smoke coming from his car, slowed down and 
finally retired with rear break failure, having completed 45 laps. 
Rosberg inexplicably ran over the grass and, still struggling for power 
and therefore speed, was now in a different race — with those behind 
him.

Could he hang on? No. 
With two laps remaining, Ricciardo wrestled his way past the Mercedes of
 Rosberg. ‘Daniel is an amazing young man,’ said Red Bull designer 
Adrian Newey. ‘What impresses me most is how calming he is when he comes
 on the team radio. We were a bit lucky today in truth but we were there
 and ready.’

Correct. 
Rosberg, who had problems with the energy recovery system and 
consequently with overheating brakes, said afterwards: ‘We need to be 
bullet-proof.’ Nevertheless, he could take many positives from the 
weekend, not least beating Hamilton to pole on Saturday.

The
 final twist came in the closing moments when Felipe Massa ran his 
Williams into the back of Sergio Perez, who had driven so brilliantly 
for Force India for so much of the afternoon that he was lying fourth at
 the time. It looked bad, but neither driver was seriously hurt.

The safety car came out, bringing an inappropriately stately, slow end to a rip-roaring race.
