Apple could be about to dip into its $98billion fortune and pay its shareholders a dividend for the first time in 17 years.

New CEO Tim Cook, who took over from Steve Jobs, said he believed the world's most valuable company now has more money than it needs.

And he revealed the board is deciding whether to break from the cash-hoarding ways of his predecessor - who suspended shareholder payments in 1995 when the firm was in such deep trouble it needed to hold on to every cent.

Things got so bad that Apple turned to rival Microsoft in 1997 for a $150 million infusion to stay afloat.

Microsoft came to the rescue at the same time Apple named Jobs, who died in October, as its CEO - a decision that turned out to be one of the smartest business moves ever made.

Haunted by memories of Apple's grim times, Jobs kept accumulating cash even as the company's fortunes soared during the final decade of his life.

Cook, though, appears willing to return some of the cash to shareholders since he succeeded Jobs as Apple's CEO last August.

He said, during a question-and-answer session at the firm's annual shareholders' meeting yesterday: 'We are thinking about this very deeply.

'This isn't a case where 100 percent of people are going to agree with what we do. But, frankly speaking, it's more than we need to run the company.'

One Apple shareholder, Asif Khan of Sugar Land, Texas, urged Cook to resist committing to a dividend every three months.

He said it makes more sense for Apple to pay a one-time dividend later this year before the expiration of a provision that limits the federal tax rate on dividends to 15 per cent.

If Apple opts for a regular quarterly dividend, Khan is worried it might be misinterpreted by some investors as a sign that Apple is losing confidence in its ability to keep propelling its stock price higher as the company churns out hit products such as the iPhone and iPad.

Apple is facing yet another challenge to its use of the iPad trademark in China - but this time in a court in California.

A Proview Electronics spokesman said the company filed a lawsuit against Apple's use of the trademark inside mainland China in the Santa Clara Superior Court on February 17.

An attempt by Proview to win an injunction to stop Apple from selling iPads in Shanghai was foiled this week.

A court there rejected the case pending the resolution of a similar lawsuit in a higher court in China.

Apple had no immediate direct comment on the California lawsuit.

The companies are feuding over whether Proview sold the mainland Chinese rights to the iPad trademark to Apple in a 2009 deal.

During the past year, Apple's stock has surged 50 per cent to create about $160 billion in shareholder wealth.

Apple now has a market value of $480 billion - more than the combined value of Microsoft and prominent rival Google. Apple shares gained $3.35 yesterday to close at $516.39.

The high price sparked a question about whether Apple plans to split its stock to make it more affordable to buy.

Cook indicated it is unlikely to occur, saying the board has studied the history of other companies that regularly split their stock and concluded 'it does nothing' for long-term returns.

Apple last split its stock seven years ago. The shares have increased 11-fold since then.

Although most of those gains occurred under Jobs' leadership, Apple's stock and financial results have remained stellar under Cook, Job's hand-picked successor. Cook has worked as a top Apple executive since 1998.

Given how well Apple has been doing, shareholders had little reason to complain at yesterday's hour-long meeting.

While shareholders waited in a 40-minute line to get inside the meeting at Apple's Cupertino headquarters, a few protesters carried signs urging the company to ensure that workers building its products in Taiwanese and Chinese factories are paid more and treated humanely.

'Stop iSweatshop,' one sign implored. Another stated: 'iWant an ethical phone.'

No questions about the conditions in Apple's overseas factories were posed during the meeting.

In other matters, Apple agreed to adopt a proposal from the public pension fund Calpers that will require all of the company's directors to receive a majority of shareholder votes to remain on the board.

The proposal was backed by more than 80 per cent of the shareholder votes counted in the preliminary results announced by Apple Thursday.

All eight of Apple's current directors were re-elected with at least 81 per cent of the shareholder votes in the preliminary results, so the switch to majority-voting rules wouldn't have changed this year's outcome if the new rules had already been in effect.
