Her father is a scientist, her stepmother a manager at a private hospital and she grew up in a comfortable home playing in the garden with her pet dogs.

Incredibly, this privileged young woman would come to symbolise the very worst of Welfare UK.

Mother of nine Natalie Cann, 33, made headlines last week after she and her partner, who receive £38,000 a year in benefits, demanded they be moved by the state to a five-bedroom house and given a new car because they want to keep having children and have trashed their current council home.

'We are horrified': Stephen Cann, the father of mother-of-nine Natalie, 33, said he was at a 
loss to explain how his rebellious daughter has veered so far from the 
path he intended for her. She claims £38,000 a year in benefits and has demanded a bigger council house

Wanting for nothing: Miss Cann, now 33, was raised by hard-working middle-class parents

But far from being born into the 
benefits ‘trap’, as she claims, she was raised by hard-working 
middle-class parents who are at a loss to explain how their rebellious 
daughter has veered so far from the path they intended for her.

‘It
is deplorable,’ said Stephen Cann, 62, a biomedical scientist who works
full-time for the NHS and lives in a £300,000 cottage in a Wiltshire 
village with his second wife Nikki, 58, a manager at a BMI private 
hospital.

‘Every time I 
tell her to get work she has another baby,’ he said. ‘I keep telling her
she can’t have any more children but she won’t listen. We did not bring
her up like this. We are horrified.’

Miss Cann, who is pregnant with her tenth child with Leigh Miller, 40, a former convict and drug addict, caused a huge row last week after she demanded they be rehoused.

The couple moved into their  semi-detached housing association home in Bournemouth eight years  ago with their daughter Ayesha, now 13, and sons Danny, 12, and Jamie, ten.

Despite neither of them working, they went on to have Dean, now nine, Luke, seven, Leon, four, Karleigh, three, Mercedes, one and Brooke, ten months.

They also keep a pet Royal Python, which lives in a large lit glass vivarium in the lounge.

While they have trashed their home – with doors smashed in, graffiti on the walls and mould growing on the ceilings – the property has the latest gadgets, including a 50in plasma TV, Sky HD+ and broadband, video consoles, an iPad and a brand new American-style fridge, washing machine and tumble drier set.

They have funded their lifestyle with £127 a week in child benefits, £482 a week in child tax credits and a discretionary £200 monthly payment towards their housing association rent, meaning they pay £253 a month for a property which would cost five times that if it were rented privately.

They also received £112.50 in jobseekers’ allowance until last month when Mr Miller, who claimed to have emphysema, was told by a doctor to ‘go to the gym, get fit and get a job’.

Mr Miller, who hasn’t worked since he 
was 17, has threatened to withhold rent payments and go out ‘robbing’ if
their house is not upgraded.

Miss Cann said expecting them to find jobs was unrealistic because ‘once you’re in that benefit trap, you’re in it’.

According to her parents, however, she wanted for nothing when she was growing up.

She
was adopted when she was less than a year old by Mr Cann and his first 
wife, Pauline, and spent the first years of her life by the coast in 
Christchurch, Dorset.

Benefits: Miss Cann and Mr Leigh have funded their lifestyle with £127 a week in child benefits, £482 a week in child tax credits and a discretionary £200 monthly payment towards their housing association rent

After
her parents split up, she lived with her father and his new partner in 
Maidenhead, Berkshire, before they moved to Wiltshire.

She attended a comprehensive but despite encouragement from her parents dropped out at 16 with no qualifications.

She worked for three weeks as a hairdressing assistant but soon met Mr Miller, who had spent the previous eight years in and out of jail, and started having children.

Yesterday her father said: ‘They need counselling. I’ve tried telling her the ways but she doesn’t listen. She’s going about it completely the wrong way. It has backfired big time. Leigh is from a family of nine. Natalie might be being led.

Cramped conditions: Danny, 12, Jamie, 10, Dean, nine, Luke, seven, and Leon, four, share a bedroom

Big family: Ayesha, 13, shares a bedroom with her two sisters Karleigh, aged three, and Mercedes, 22 months

‘I do worry about my grandchildren. Ayesha, the oldest, is just a child but she has to be a second mummy to the younger kids.’

His wife added: ‘We’re appalled. That is not how she was brought up at all. She was brought up to behave properly – that she had to work hard and get qualifications.

‘She was brought up to be an upstanding member of the community but it just didn’t happen.

‘She is putting her children’s health at risk. The house is like it is because they think that will help them get a new house. But it’s nothing you can’t clean up with a mop and soap.’
