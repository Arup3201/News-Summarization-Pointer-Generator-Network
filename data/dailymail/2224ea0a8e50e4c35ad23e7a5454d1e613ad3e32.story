Ford is recalling about 850,000 cars and SUVs because of a problem that could stop the air bags from working in a crash.

The recalled models include the 2013-14 Ford C-Max compact, Fusion midsize, Escape SUV and the Lincoln MKZ luxury car, all sold in North America.

Ford says the restraints control module in the car could short circuit, causing the air-bag warning indicator to light up.

If the short circuit occurs, restraint devices including the air bags, pretensioners, and side curtains might not work in a crash, the car company says.

Ford says the short circuit could also affect the car's stability control and other systems.

Ford Motor Co. says it 'is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this condition. Dealers will replace the restraints control module at no cost to the customer.' 

The company said 746,842 of the vehicles were sold in the U.S., with 82,962 sold in Canada and 20,246 sold in Mexico.

Ford says 'Affected vehicles include certain 2013-2014 C-MAX vehicles built at Michigan Assembly Plant, Jan. 19, 2012 to Nov. 21, 2013; certain 2013-2014 Fusion vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, Feb. 3, 2012 to Aug. 24, 2013; certain 2013-2014 Escape vehicles built at Louisville Assembly Plant, Oct. 5, 2011 to Nov. 1, 2013 and certain 2013-2014 Lincoln MKZ vehicles built at Hermosillo Assembly Plant, April 25, 2012 to Sept. 30, 2013.'

Ford shares rose 7 cents to $16.27 in morning trading.

Automakers have recalled more than 40 million cars and trucks in the U.S. so far this year, which is a record.

Most of those vehicles have been recalled by General Motors Co., which announced early this year that a faulty ignition switch could cut power to the engine, knocking out the power steering or brakes and disabling the air bags if the car crashes.
