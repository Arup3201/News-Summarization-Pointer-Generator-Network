The infatuated accomplice of serial killer Joanna Dennehy has launched an appeal against his life sentence.

Gary Stretch, who is 7ft 3inches tall, was jailed for a minimum of 19 years after being convicted of helping Dennehy murder three men in a gruesome ten-day killing spree.

The 48-year-old - whose real name Gary Richards - shouted 'thank you very much' when he was sentenced in February this year for two counts of attempted murder and preventing the burial of Dennehy's victims.

Dennehy (pictured) was handed a whole-life prison term - only the third ever to be given to a woman - after murdering three men in a ten-day spree 

But Stretch, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, has now launched an appeal against the length of his sentence, for the second time. 

Dennehy, 31, who pleaded guilty to the murders, was handed a whole-life prison term - only the third ever to be given to a woman. 

After the trial, it emerged Stretch had sent Dennehy twisted letters from his cell, calling her his 'devil in the flesh' and describing sex with her as 'a dream never to come true'. 

He also praised her 'bloodthirsty' leanings and 'dirty and dark mind', as they both awaited sentence for their heinous crimes. 

Stretch even signed off the letters with 'Your biggest supporter!' 'Undertaker' and 'Hubby 4 Lifey'.  

During the trial, prosecutors said Dennehy 'cast a spell' over her alleged accomplices and some of her victims as she killed 'for fun'.

The bodies of Dennehy's victims - including John Chapman (left) and Kevin Lee (right) - were found in ditches in East Anglia in March and April last year 

Dennehy also stabbed Lukasz Slaboszewski (pictured) to death, before going on to repeatedly stab two other dog walkers in Hereford, who both survived 

Stretch was described as a 'nodding dog' to Dennehy who was said to be 'a sadistic serial killer with a fearsome personality'. 

Throughout the trial, Stretch claimed he had acted under 'duress' and in fear of what Dennehy might do to him. He also refused to give evidence during his trial at Cambridge Crown Court.

But he was convicted after a trial in which jurors saw CCTV images of him walking hand-in-hand with Dennehy through a motorway service station.

The bodies of Dennehy's victims - Lukasz Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee and John Chapman - were found dumped in ditches in East Anglia in March and April last year.

Dennehy's brutal murders sparked a nationwide manhunt for her and Stretch.  Officers also combed several pieces of land to try and find the pair's victims (pictured) 

After the killings, Dennehy and Stretch drove to Hereford where she selected two other men - Robin Bereza and John Rogers - at random.

She repeatedly stabbed the dog walkers in the street but both survived.  

Dennehy pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, two of attempted murder and three of preventing the lawful and decent burials of her three victims.

Two other accomplices were also jailed.

Robert Moore, 56, was jailed for three years after he admitted sheltering Dennehy and Leslie Layton, 36, was jailed for 14 years for preventing the burials of her victims. 

Stretch's appeal case is due to be heard tomorrow.
