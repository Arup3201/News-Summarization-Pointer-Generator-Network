Shot: Pragaret Singh, 35, was attacked as he left Manchester Food Traders in Openshaw, Manchester

A businessman was shot dead by armed robbers who fled with ‘tens of thousands of pounds’ of his company takings.

Pragaret Singh, 35, who was married with three children aged seven, five and two, was locking up his food whole-sale business with his nephew when he was targeted on Friday night.

As he tried to get into his BMW to drive away he was attacked by two men.

He struggled with the pair but was shot twice, in the chest and stomach. The thieves stole the cash he had been carrying, before fleeing in a small silver hatchback, possibly a Vauxhall.

Mr Singh’s nephew, who was uninjured, dialled 999 following the attack and alerted police. 

Last night relatives and friends of Mr Singh, who was known as Charlie, described him as a ‘true gentleman’ and condemned his murderers.

His brother Tiggy said: ‘He was robbed of his life. He was happy, jolly and full of life – he never said anything bad about anyone. 

'He was the kind of person who’d go out of his way to help anyone in need. He had taken out loans to give financial help to his colleagues, acting as their guarantors.

‘The robbers could have shot him in the leg, they could have hit him with a stick – but instead they shot him twice. He had no chance. If they’d have shot him once, he’s the kind of person who probably would have put up a fight.’ 

British-born Mr Singh lived with his wife Sukhwinder, 33, their children and other members of his extended family in a large £750,000 home on the outskirts of the smart suburb of Worsley, Greater Manchester.

The company director had run Manchester Food Traders, a successful import and export business, for around 15 years. 

He was locking up at the premises, on an industrial estate in Openshaw, with his nephew just after 6pm when the raiders struck.

Mr Singh, who comes from a large, respected Sikh family, was taken to hospital but pronounced dead around an hour later. 

Officers have taken away CCTV footage but last night the offenders remained at large.

Detective Superintendent Jon Chadwick said Mr Singh had simply been trying to ‘protect his livelihood from criminals’. 

He added: ‘Charlie’s entire family have suffered an unimaginable loss. Their lives have been shattered.’

One of the offenders is described as black, in his twenties or thirties, with spiky, knotted hair. He was clean-shaven, tall and slim and wearing a jacket with rolled up sleeves.
