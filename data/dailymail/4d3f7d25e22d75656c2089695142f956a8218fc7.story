The earliest known colour footage of the Beatles showing the Fab Four backstage at a concert in Blackpool has surfaced for the very first time.

The three-and-a-half minute film, that has never before been seen, shows John, Paul, George and Ringo at the ABC Theatre in August 1963.

The footage, that has no sound, was shot on an 8mm film by Chas McDevitt of the Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group, which was one of the support acts for the Beatles that night. 

A still from the earliest known colour footage of the Beatles showing the Fab Four backstage at a concert in Blackpool 

The footage features all four members of the group, including John Lennon, pictured. It was filmed by Chas McDevitt of the Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group, which was one of the support acts for the Beatles that night

Some of the film shows the band performing live and was recorded in the wings of the stage by Mr McDevitt.

The footage has now been made available for sale with copyright at auction alongside more than 100 photos of the Beatles that have also never been seen before.

The black and white snaps were taken by Eve Bowen during the band’s tour of America in 1965 at the height of Beatlemania.

The photographer followed the band as they travelled by train from Washington to New York where they appeared and performed on the Ed Sullivan Show.

Her photos show one of superstar John Lennon having to wait behind the buffet trolley as it wheels its way down the narrow train aisle while passengers sit either looking on.

A sign on the trolley advertising cheese and pickle sandwiches and a can of Coca Cola for 60 cents shows the snacks the group might have enjoyed on the journey.

The pictures of the Fab Four were taken by photographer Eve Bowen, and the 109 original negatives she took are expected to fetch £12,000 at auction 

There is also a snap of George Harrison relaxing while listening to a pair of white earphones, not too dissimilar to the standard Apple ones used today.

While another shot shows the hoards of screaming fans which greeted the Beatles as well as a snaps of them performing on the Ed Sullivan Show taken by Ms Bowen from the audience.

The images, that are also being sold with full copyright, are all previously unseen and unreleased.

The 109 original negatives are valued at £12,000 while the colour footage is estimated at £9,000.

Both lots were acquired by Mark Hayward, a well-known Beatles collector, who is now selling them at Ewbank’s Auctioneers of Woking, Surrey.

Alistair McCrea, of Ewbank’s, said: 'The film footage is the earliest known colour footage of the Beatles.

Ms Bowen also took snaps of the group from the audience while they performed on the Ed Sullivan TV show 

The pictures are being auctioned at Ewbank’s Auctioneers of Woking, Surrey next month

'There might be some earlier film still stuffed in someone’s drawer but we don’t know of any earlier colour footage than this.

'If you think about it, this was 1963 and not that many people had access to colour cameras at that time.

'The film shows the Beatles messing about back stage, chatting and laughing and reading fan letters. There is some footage of them on stage that was shot from the wings.

'Unfortunately it is silent and is a little bit eerie in a way.

The full collection of footage and documentation, which is up for sale, which includes a letter of provenance from Chas McDevitt, who took the footage 

'The same owner who has consigned the negatives has recently had half-a-dozen 6ins by 4ins print made to show the market what they are like.

'They are unusual because they are quite informal and intimate.'

The colour 8mm footage also comes with a DVD version of it and a letter of provenance from Mr McDevitt, who is still alive.

The sale takes place on February 5.
