It really will be Titanic occasion – in terms of scale and location and not that sinking feeling – when Carl Frampton makes his bid for the IBF world super-bantamweight title on September 6.

Promoter Barry McGuigan will stage Frampton’s challenge to Spain’s Kiko Martinez in a specially built arena on the site from which the Titanic was launched in Belfast.

The 16,000-crowd - the biggest fight attendance ever in Northern Ireland – will assemble in a space around the new Titanic Museum and cranes of the old shipyard.

The temporary stands will be erected and then taken down, in quick fire-fashion, similar to the conversion of Wembley Stadium for Carl Froch’s victory over George Groves.

A rescued Titanic stairway in the museum, as well as the slipway into which the great ill-fated ship was launched and the tug which pulled it into the water, will be used for VIP entertaining.

The boxing set-up must be in and out quickly to accommodate the Belfast Proms.

This unique project has required the support of Northern Ireland’s first minister Peter Robinson.

Frampton himself is thrilled by the concept and said: ‘I mustn’t be letting anybody down here.

‘I’m already virtually in shape for the fight. Everybody in Ulster expects me to win a world title as a matter of course but I know it’s not as easy as that.

‘I’m preparing for a tough fight.’

This a rematch following Frampton’s earlier stoppage of Martinez in an eliminator.

But the Spaniard has regrouped since to beat Frampton to the IBF belt.

Martinez claims: ‘I have regained all my confidence from winning the title and I have no doubts about coming back to Belfast to defend it.’

The idea for the very special setting was born, ironically, from McGuigan’s memory of an open air fight in a huge temporary arena which used to be erected in the car park of Cesar’s Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

McGuigan lost his world title in 120-degree heat there to American Steve Cruz in 1986.

But he said: ‘It will be a nostalgic venue but, trust me, there’s not the same result for Carl this time.’
