With their private jets, luxury holidays and wardrobes full of designer labels, the WAG lifestyle is an enviable one to say the least.

But while the glitzy lives of footballers' nearest and dearest look fabulous from the outside, an explosive new book reveals that all isn't quite as it seems.

In The Secret WAG, the anonymous wife of an England international tells of her life in the Premiership fast lane - and the road blocks that come with it.

From being beaten up by bitchy girls in a nightclub toilet to enduring a torrid tabloid sex scandal starring her husband, the life of a WAG isn't always an easy one.

Not, as she's at pains to point out, that everything is bad. 'What I always say is that my children have really benefited,' the Secret WAG revealed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline.

'They are really privileged and we remind them every day how lucky they are. I have travelled a lot and have been lucky enough to see some amazing places - and it's all because of his wages.'

But while she enjoys a £7,000 monthly allowance and lives a jet set lifestyle, the Secret WAG also tells of having to endure girls throwing themselves at her husband, putting her own career ambitions on hold and having to be prepared to relocate at the drop of a hat.

'We were once in this bar together and this girl was really intoxicated and she was just throwing herself at [my husband] and she had her arm round his waist,' recalls the Secret WAG.

'I was stood right next to him and that's when I find it disrespectful. When they are really good looking it does make you feel insecure.'

Luckily, her husband, who was once caught out in a tabloid kiss and tell - a story that the Secret WAG says wasn't true - has developed a strategy for seeing them off.

'He has his own way of being polite but firm and he won't play up to the girls,' she explains. 'He lets them know when they've crossed the line.'

Nevertheless, she says the constant gaggle of girls that surround her husband, understandably, do make her nervous.

'I would be a fool to trust him 100 per cent,' she admits. 
'Footballers don't have a great reputation with all the cheating that's 
reported in the papers.

'There are always going to be doubts in my mind. 
But I don't think he's cheating, I’m 100 per cent about that.'

While girls in nightclubs and paps lurking about outside the door are downsides of the WAG way of life, upsides include glamorous holidays as well as the chance to accompany their men on international tours.

'I do enjoy being away on tour,' admits the Secret WAG, who grew up in a football-loving middle class family and loved going to matches with her father as a child.

'There is a real buzz when the stadium is packed and it’s very exciting. I do enjoy football, I love watching England and I'm really 
looking forward to the World Cup.

'But,' she adds, 'it does dictate my life and my 
husband’s. We aren't always living where we want to live and he has 
ended up missing birthdays and christenings and Christmas.'

There's also the issue of sex before a game which, according to the Secret WAG, really is banned in the hours leading up to a big match.

'There
 is this unwritten rule of no sex before the game,' she laughs. 'I don't know who said
 it - probably a woman who's not very horny.

'I think you’re fine 
the night before, although maybe not just before the game. You might wear him out but that depends on his performance, I suppose.'

More troublesome are the other WAGs, who, as the secret WAG reveals in her book, can be a daunting bunch to begin with.

Nevertheless, she says she resents the WAG stereotype and adds that many have careers and charity work that they're rarely credited for.

'There are a few who do conform, who get great satisfaction from 
getting a new car or a designer handbag and who are really 
materialistic,' she explains.

'But there are a lot who aren't like that who are 
tarnished with the same brush. I know a lot of lovely WAGS who are 
mothers who will go to the playground with their kids and aren't all 
about the glitz and glamour.

'WAGS are never recognised for the good they
 do only the bad - a lot of us are involved in charity work and I really 
try to get involved as much as possible.'

With the World Cup kicking off in Brazil, she's unlikely to have much spare time for charity work over the next month, although she is looking forward to seeing how the world responds to her warts and all memoir.

'I wanted to share the reality of being a
 WAG,' she explains. 'It's my story and it goes way back over the years, from my upbringing
 to how I've progressed. It definitely isn't all glitz and glamour!'
