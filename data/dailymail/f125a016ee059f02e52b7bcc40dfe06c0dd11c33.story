A teenager suspected of looting during last week's riots was out on bail over a murder at the time.

The 18-year-old had previously been arrested after a 21-year-old was chased down and repeatedly stabbed by a gang of 25 youths in north London.

The teenager was back in court at the weekend accused of breaking into a Carphone Warehouse in Holloway, north London last week.

but officers recovered seven tracksuits, two boxed mobile phones, seven
