Spanish striker Ayoze perez celebrates scoring the winner  as Newcastle beat Liverpool 1-0 on Saturday

NEWCASTLE: (4-4-2)

Tim Krul - 6.5

Rarely bothered by Liverpool’s attack but did what he had to with minimum fuss. 

Daryl Janmaat - 7.5

Strong in the tackle – upending Balotelli at the cost of a booking – but was purposeful in attack as well, although he was lucky to avoid second yellow.

Fabricio Coloccini - 7

A picture of coolness and composure yet again. Skipper is in fine form right now. 

Steven Taylor - 7.5

No-nonsense defending throughout and kept Balotelli out of the game. Three wins from three since he came into side.

Paul Dummett - 7

Kept Sterling quiet and for that he must be applauded. Another solid outing. 

Mehdi Abeid - 6.5

Nervy at times on Premier League debut but kept things ticking over in middle of park. 

Jack Colback - 6.5

Tidy if unspectacular but got through a lot of work. 

Moussa Sissoko - 8.5

Menacing runs from deep asked questions of Reds and it was he who had major say in winning goal. Immense from first minute to last. A man of the match performance 

French international Moussa Sissoko, holding off Raheem Sterling, was a constant threat on Saturday

Gabriel Obertan (Off 27') - 6

Was causing problems for Moreno before thigh injury cut short his involvement. 

Papiss Cisse (Off 46') - 5.5

One chance which was cleared from line but did not look as sharp as he did before the knee injury which has troubled him the past fortnight. 

Gabriel Obertan pulls up whilst on another speedy break and had to go off injured in the first-half

Sammy Ameobi (Off 66') - 6

Got at Johnson early on but faded and became sloppy as the game wore on. 

Substitutes:

Rolando Aarons (On 27) - 6

The intent was there but the execution not after first-half introduction. 

Promising Newcastle junior Rolando Aarons manages to keep the ball from Steven Gerrard and Joe Allen

Remy Cabella (On 66') - 6.5

Could have scored his first goal for club but was denied by Mignolet. Was busy after arrival midway through second half.

Ayoze Perez (On 46') - 7

United’s match-winner for the second week in a row and is fast becoming a favourite in these parts.

LIVERPOOL: (4-3-3) 

Liverpool keeper Simon Mignolet made some impressive saves but couldn't keep out Perez's strike 

Simon Mignolet - 5

Flapped at crosses and did not command his area. Looks nervy right now. 

Glen Johnson - 5.5

Was troubled by Ameobi early on but saved his side with goal-line block before half-time.

Martin Skrtel - 6

A couple of shaky moments but was strong apart and perhaps should have scored with first-half header. 

Dejan Lovren - 5.5

Didn’t have a great deal to do in fairness but Rodgers wasn’t pleased with some of his distribution.

Alberto Moreno - 5

His error proved costly when dithering to allow Perez to score. 

Liverpool full back up against Obertan was at fault for the decisive goal in the second-half against Newcastle

Jordan Henderson - 5.5

Failed to impact and barely got a kick first-half. Didn’t fare much better after break. 

Steven Gerrard - 6

Tidy enough but nothing telling from the skipper and raking passes came to precious little. 

Former England captain Steven Gerrard couldn't prevent his Liverpool side losing at St James' Park

Joe Allen (Off 66') - 5

Passed the ball efficiently without ever penetrating United’s backline. 

Philippe Coutinho (Off 80') - 6 

Looked Liverpool’s best bet of conjuring something in final third. 

Mario Balotelli - 5.5

Anonymous first half, although he was too isolated. Came into game after break but still not enough from the Italian.

Mercurial striker Mario Balotelli was closely marked at Newcastle and was isolated for large parts of the game

Raheem Sterling - 5

A subdued afternoon and he’ll be disappointed with this performance. No end product. 

Substitutes:

Fabio Borini (On 66') - 6

Almost made immediate impact with shot which fizzed wide. 

Rickie Lambert (On 80')
