Brendan Rodgers must take the blame for Liverpool's elimination from the Champions League, according to former Reds boss Roy Evans.

The Merseysiders failed to qualify from Group B after being held 1-1 at home by Basle on Tuesday night when a win was needed to progress.

Rodgers admitted his side didn't deserve to win and Evans believes the Liverpool boss got his tactics against the Swiss side.

Evans, speaking to the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show on talkSPORT, said: 'The way we approached the game was a bit negative for me. We started the game - a game we needed to win – with a really low tempo. We didn't put them under pressure and I'm thinking, "Go for them"

'If you need to win, why not put them under pressure from the word go? We waited until we were down to 10 men with 20 minutes to go and then we throw everything at them. We nearly got there but why not do it from the start? That's the only gripe I've got.

'You can be too tactical, you can over think the whole thing. Sometimes you need to think, "OK, we need to win this one game, go out and go for it".'

Former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol believes the defeat and early elimination from the Champions League may have cost Rodgers his job and said: 'If things don't change then ultimately Brendan will pay the price. If this team keeps performing the way it is, I don't think they will have any other option [but to sack Rodgers]. 

'We are not even halfway through the season yet and I'm guessing most people don't expect Liverpool to get into the top four. 

'The biggest surprise is how bad the performances are. The result against Basle was a complete disaster on so many levels. The performance level, the fact they are out of the Champions League and the fact they now go into the Europa League, which is going to do nothing but harm them in the Premier League.

'You really wonder where this team is going. He has tried to add to the squad to make it better and somehow it has turned the other way. It is a team that is completely rudderless. If you watched the game against Basle and the game against Sunderland, they don't look to have any imagination going forward, and defensively they look at odds. This is just a desperate time for Liverpool.'
