England's not-so-friendly friendly with  Scotland takes place at Celtic Park on Tuesday evening.

It might not be a Euro 2016 qualifier but Roy Hodgson's men should be fired-up for the clash with their old rivals, particularly given the Three Lions' impressive record north of the border.

Ahead of the game, Sportsmail takes a closer look at England's last five visits.

13th November 1999, Hampden Park, Glasgow

Scotland 0 England 2 (Scholes, 21 and 42), Euro 2000 qualifier 

Paul Scholes' first-half goals proved decisive as he propelled England towards qualification for Euro 2000. 

Scholes silenced the home crowd in the 21st minute when he side-footed the ball past Neil Sullivan, having superbly controlled a cross from Sol Campbell. 

His second goal of the match came 20 minutes later when he converted a David Beckham free-kick with his head.

27th May 1989, Hampden Park, Glasgow

Scotland 0 England 2 (Waddle, 20, Bull, 82), Rous Cup

This win meant that England won the 1989 Rous Cup, an international tournament contested between England and Scotland and occasionally a guest team from South America. 

Chris Waddle put England ahead in the 20th minute with a diving header from close range before substitute Steve Bull sealed the game eight minutes from time with an emphatic finish after controlling a long ball.

23 May 1987, Hampden Park, Glasgow

Scotland 0 England 0, Rous Cup

One of the less memorable meetings between the sides, dominated by England in terms of possession and chances. 

The chance of the game fell to England captain Bryan Robson, who blazed his header over the bar from six yards out. Scotland went on to lose 2-0 to Brazil who finished as tournament champions.

Scotland 1 (Gough 68) England 0, Rous Cup

Scotland halted celebrations of England's 600th match with a 1-0 win to make them Rous Cup winners in 1985. 

Richard Gough's goal in the 68th minute proved to be the difference. He placed his header in the top-right corner leaving Peter Shilton with no chance.

Scotland 1 (McGhee, 13) England 1 (Woodcock 36), 1984 British Home Championship

The closing fixture of a tournament held between the home nations, with all four sides ending up on level points but Northern Ireland winning on goal difference. 

Scotland's Mark McGhee opened the scoring, nodding past Shilton from a pinpoint Gordon Strachan cross. 

However Tony Woodcock equalised superbly in the 36th minute, cutting inside from the right wing onto his left foot and finding the top corner with a sweetly struck shot from 20 yards.
