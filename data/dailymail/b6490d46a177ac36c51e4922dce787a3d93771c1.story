George Groves will aim to put his Wembley demons behind him when he returns to the ring on September 20 for the first time following his brutal KO at the hands of Carl Froch.

Groves suffered a crushing loss to Froch at the national stadium, but now returns in a final WBC title eliminator against Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse at Wembley Arena.

Should the ‘Saint’ overcome Rebrasse, he will fight for the WBC super-middleweight world title against one of Anthony Dirrell and Sakio Bika, who are due to clash on August 16.

Groves - 
whose defeat to Froch came on May 31, admitted it was crucial not to 
dwell on the nature of the loss - an eighth-round KO - he suffered 
against his bitter rival.

‘It’s 
great to be back, back at Wembley and back in world-class boxing,’ said 
the 26-year-old Groves who signed for Sauerland promotions ahead of his 
rematch with Froch.

‘It didn’t
 go quite as I’d hoped last time out (against Froch), but I think I 
proved I belong at world level. In boxing sometimes it does just take 
one punch and that was what happened to end my ambition to become world 
champion.

‘But we 
are back on the road in that journey and the journey will continue. This
 is a big fight for me - Rebrasse is a very good fighter. Most 
importantly he offers me a step back to be world champion. He has a very
 good record, he’s European champion, and it gives me an opportunity to 
get right back into the picture and become world champion. I’m sure that
 will happen in the very near future.’

Groves, who will expected to beat Rebrasse, 32, comfortably, said he had no regrets following back-to-back defeats to Froch.

‘I didn’t enjoy falling off the horse, but we’ll be back on it soon,’ Groves added. ‘I approach boxing as a high-stakes gambler.

‘I put a 
lot on the line. Sometimes it pays off, but when it doesn’t you end up 
losing big too. Fortunately for me I haven’t changed that mentality. I 
still have a deep conviction that I will be world champion.’

Asked 
whether he would engage in his infamous mind games against Rebrasse, a 
man who speaks no English, Groves joked: ‘maybe I’ll just dribble out 
some Del Boy-style French and see if he can work it out!’

Rebrasse 
has a record of 22 wins, two defeats and three draws. Groves has won 19 
of his 21 fights, with both defeats coming against Froch.

Groves 
promoter Kalle Sauerland said there was a possibility that Liverpool 
heavyweight David Price could fight on the undercard.
