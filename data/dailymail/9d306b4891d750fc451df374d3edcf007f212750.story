The daughter of a former professor and south Mississippian who 'despised phonies' loved bacon, women and his 'over-sized old man remote' has penned a touching and honest tribute to her father which has captured the imagination of thousands.

Amanda Lewis, an attorney from Dallas, decided to eschew formality when it came to remembering her father Harry Weathersby Stamps in her obituary for the Sun Herald.

And she was right. Since it appeared yesterday it has been read by thousands and spread around the world with some readers calling the light-hearted tribute 'the best obit ever'.

Mr Stamps, a Korea war veteran and former government and sociology professor at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College died at home on Saturday, leaving his wife of 50 years, Ann Moore, two daughters and two grandsons.

Lewis wrote the obituary on the journey to her parents home in Long Beach, Mississippi, with her English teacher sister, Alison, helping with the editing process.

'I kept thinking of things -- there are a lot of things I just couldn't put in there -- and I thought, 'Mama's not going to let me run that.' But she read it and said, 'That's him,'' she told the Sun Herald.

'He wouldn't know what going viral means. He would have thought that was a disease he contracted, which would have excited him to have another illness to lord over folks,' she joked in response to the tribute's overnight popularity.

One typical paragraph of the obituary reads: 'He excelled at growing camellias, rebuilding houses after hurricanes, rocking, eradicating mole crickets from his front yard, composting pine needles, living within his means, outsmarting squirrels, never losing a game of competitive sickness, and reading any history book he could get his hands on.'

'He loved to use his over-sized 'old man' remote control, which thankfully survived Hurricane Katrina, to flip between watching The Barefoot Contessa and anything on The History Channel.'

It adds: 'The women in his life were numerous. He particularly fancied smart women.'

Speaking of his close relationship with his daughters, she adds: 'He taught them to fish, to select a quality hammer, to love nature, and to just be thankful. He took great pride in stocking their tool boxes. One of his regrets was not seeing his girl, Hillary Clinton, elected President.'

On his 'natty dressing' she writes: 'Harry
took fashion cues from no one. His signature every day look was all 
his: a plain pocketed T-shirt designed by the fashion house Fruit of the
Loom, his black-label elastic waist shorts worn above the navel and 
sold exclusively at the Sam's on Highway 49, and a pair of old school 
Wallabees (who can even remember where he got those?) that were always 
paired with a grass-stained MSU baseball cap.'

She also listed his loves and hates writing: 'He despised phonies, his 1969 Volvo (which he also loved), know-it-all Yankees, Southerners who used the words 'veranda' and 'porte cochere' to put on airs, eating grape leaves, Law and Order (all franchises), cats, and Martha Stewart. In reverse order. He particularly hated Day Light Saving Time, which he referred to as The Devil's Time. It is not lost on his family that he died the very day that he would have had to spring his clock forward. This can only be viewed as his final protest.'

As an added tribute the family have requested well-wishers write to their senators to make a protest against Day Light Saving Time.

Stamps was also a foodie - the obituary mentions his trademark dish - a bacon and tomato sandwich.

'Harry was locally sourcing his food years before chefs in California starting using cilantro and arugula (both of which he hated),' it says.

Food-lover: A young Harry Stamps leisurely mans the BBQ. He was remembered for his love of good food

'As a point of pride, he purported to remember every meal he had eaten in his 80 years of life. He had a life-long love affair with deviled eggs, Lane cakes, boiled peanuts, Vienna [Vi-e-na] sausages on saltines, his homemade canned fig preserves, pork chops, turnip greens, and buttermilk served in martini glasses garnished with cornbread.

'It's hard to capture him in just one story,' Lewis told the local newspaper. 'For all of us, he was like this.'

'After he was diagnosed with diabetes, he told me, 'Life's not worth living if I can't have butter on my sweet potatoes.' That pretty much summed up his point of view on things.'

'Probably the best compliment I've gotten is that at least six people asked if he wrote it,' she added.

One such compliment came from friend Wayne Catlett who said it 'captured the essence of Harry'.

'He definitely was one of a kind,' he said. 'He always found humor in every situation. It was a great way to cope with life. Whatever it was, he managed to get through it by laughing at it and getting you to laugh.'

'Students referred to his class as the Stamps Comedy Hour. He was a brilliant teacher, incredibly interesting. And you know, I have never heard a student or anybody else say a bad thing about Harry,' he said.

'You never forgot Harry Stamps,' he added.
