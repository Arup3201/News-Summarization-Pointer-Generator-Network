David Cameron is contemplating sending his eldest daughter to an inner-city comprehensive so she can receive a 'normal education'

David Cameron is contemplating sending his eldest daughter to an inner-city comprehensive so she can receive a 'normal education'.

Mr Cameron, who had a privileged education at Eton College, has reportedly visited several state schools in the capital in his quest to find a suitable secondary school place for 10-year-old Nancy.  

The Prime Minister is understood to have visited The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England School, an all-girls comprehensive three-quarters of a mile from Downing Street, according to the Telegraph.  

Chief whip Michael Gove famously chose Grey Coat Hospital school for his daughter Beatrice's secondary education while he was education secretary.

Mr Cameron and his wife also visited Holland Park School – one of the first comprehensives in the UK – earlier this week, according to the Times.

The school is usually more associated with Labour grandees such as the late Tony Benn and also has up to six former pupils who have either left Britain to  become Islamic jihadists in the Middle East or were linked to Islamic terrorism.

Despite being in two of the wealthiest boroughs in the capital, both schools are described as 'ethnically diverse' and have intakes from some of London's most deprived areas.

The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England school - the local secondary school to Number 10 - has two-thirds of pupils from 'a wide range of minority ethnic backgrounds'.

Nancy and Beatrice Gove attended the same primary school in Kensington, central London and it is thought Mr Cameron has been discussing his decision with Mr Gove.  

Mrs Cameron - who was educated at Marlborough College - has also reportedly told friends she is keen for Nancy to have a 'normal education'. 

A friend told the paper: 'Her children's lives are abnormal enough. Being in a state school is a nice antidote to that.

'You get to meet normal children from normal houses whose fathers don't go off and spend the weekend with Angela Merkel.'

Despite its proximity to Number 10, The Grey Coat Hospital Church of England school has two-thirds of pupils from 'a wide range of minority ethnic backgrounds'

In its latest Ofsted report, published in 2009, the school was rated as 'outstanding' - the top ranking given by the education watchdog. 

Grey Coat's intake is described as 'diverse with two thirds of students from a wide range of minority ethnic groups, of which the largest are groups with Black African or Black caribbean heritage'.

It adds that 'one third of students speak a first language other than English but very few are at an early stage of learning English.' 

The 12-page admissions criteria describes how each of the 151 place for Year 7 students is decided upon.

According to the criteria, 15 of the 151 places will be awarded to girls with an aptitude for languages; 80 to practising Church of England families and 28 to 'Churches Together' faiths.

Governors allocate 25 per cent of the places to girls of above- average ability, 50 per cent to those of average ability and 25 per cent to students of below-average ability.

Mr and Mrs Cameron are also considering Holland Park, one of the first comprehensives in the UK, which has up to six former who have left Britain to became Islamic jihadists in the Middle East or were linked to Islamic terrorism

The remaining 28 places will go to children with siblings at the school, and girls living in the surrounding parishes. 

But the school has been criticised in the past for being an 'elite' state school.

After Mr Gove announced his daughter would become a pupil there, research by the Fair Admissions Campaign found 14 per cent of children are eligible for free school meals, compared with an average of 33 per cent locally.

It also claimed it was in the 'top 1 per cent of the least socio-economically inclusive secondary schools in England'.  

Michael Gove’s daughter Beatrice won a place at Grey Coat Hospital School earlier this year, making him the first Conservative education secretary to send his child to a state secondary. 

George Osborne, the chancellor, removed his children from a state primary to send them to a private prep school.

David Willets, the universities and science minister, also caused controversy when opted for private schools Godolphin and Latymer and St Paul’s.

When Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he attracted controversy by sending his children to the Roman Catholic London Oratory school.

Critics said it selected by parental interview, which favoured the professional middle classes.

In addition, he and his wife, Cherie, used teachers from the independent Westminster school to give his sons Euan and Nicky extra tuition.

The Prime Minister has constantly had to battle sceptics who feel his education at Eton College makes him ill-equipped to represent ordinary voters.

And Mrs Cameron is the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield – a landowner descended from Charles II.

She attended the fee-paying Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where the Duchess of Cambridge was also educated.

But her time studying fine arts at the University of the West of England in Bristol apparently convinced Mrs Cameron that her children would benefit from exposure to people of different backgrounds.

The move would see Mr Cameron become the first Tory Prime Minister to send his child to a state school while in Downing Street. 

Other options are thought to include St Marylebone School in central London and Lady Margaret School in Parsons Green, west London. 

Mr Cameron has now visited Holland Park School in Kensington - dubbed the 'Eton of Comprehensives' - twice, including at an open day this week. 

The school counts Hollywood actress Anjelica Huston and Mr Benn’s children among its alumni.

With a catchment area including some of the wealthiest homes in the capital, around 60 per cent of pupils at Holland Park come from ‘a wide range of ethnic backgrounds’, according to Ofsted, and speak English as a second language.

Six former pupils of the school have travelled to Syria, three of whom have been killed in fighting.

One appeared on a video in the summer appealing for more recruits from the UK to join Islamic State’s ‘golden era of jihad’; one woman was found guilty in August of fundraising for terrorism and her female co-defendant, who was in the same year as her at Holland Park, was cleared of the same offence. 

Mr Cameron has spoken openly in the past about his plans to send his children to state schools,

During a question and answer session at the John Cabot Academy in Bristol in November 2012, Mr Cameron said: ‘I would like my children to go to state schools, that’s my intention, and I think what’s happening in the state school system is really exciting.

‘What we’re seeing is something we should have seen years ago which is the flowering of more choice, more competition, more diversity and crucially higher standards. I want my children to be part of that and I’m very heartened by what is happening.’

A Number 10 spokesman said: 'As with other parents at this time of year, the Prime Minister and Mrs Cameron are looking at various schools for their daughter to go to next September.'
