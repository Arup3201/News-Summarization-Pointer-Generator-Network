Gamers who had trouble accessing their PlayStation Plus accounts over the Christmas holidays are set to get an extra five days added to their memberships. The gift is only available to people who had an active PlayStation Plus membership, or who had already activated their free trial, on 25 December

The extra five days will be added to relevant memberships automatically on the day they are due to expire. 

Eric Lempel, vice president of Sony Network Entertainment wrote in a blog post: 'Since access to PlayStation Network was impacted during the holidays, we wanted to show our appreciation for your patience.  

PlayStation Plus lets gamers play with other people online.

Membership to Plus can be purchased through PlayStation Store  for 90 days or a year.

Local prices for memberships can be found at Sony's site. 

In the UK, prices start at £11.99 for 90 days and £39.99 for a year. In the US, this is $17.99 and $49.99 respectively. 

This is a one-off fee.   

'In addition, sometime this month we will announce that for a limited time, we will be offering a 10 per cent discount code good for a one-time discount off a total cart purchase in the PlayStation Store as a thank you to all PSN members.'

Mr Lempel continued that this discount will be available on films, games, game add-ons, season passes and TV shows.   

'Thanks again to all our loyal PlayStation fans and welcome to our newest console owners,' added Mr Lempel. 

Both Sony and Microsoft's online networks were hit by hackers on Christmas Day, and remained offline for days afterwards.   

A group of hackers called Lizard Squad - or someone claiming to speak for it - took credit for the disruptions and said it wanted to expose the firm's poor security.

Microsoft's Xbox Live service, was back online last Friday, although the company reported continuing problems. Sony's service was brought back online on Monday.   

So far, there's no evidence to link these episodes with last month's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment. 

A group of hackers called Lizard Squad took credit for bringing down the Microsoft's Xbox, and Sony's PlayStation online networks. 

Disruptions began on Christmas day. 

The hacking group said it wanted to expose the two firm's poor security.

The consoles rely on an internet connection for many functions.

One of the most popular features of the consoles, for example, is the ability to play against friends and other users. 

While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up.

Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. 

Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack.

A message on the Xbox status page at the weekend said its core services were 'up and running'. 

Sony engineers then confirmed its core services were also back online, but heavy traffic might continue to cause problems, as thousands of users log back on.

The FBI blamed that attack on North Korea, which was said to be furious about Sony's The Interview - a movie comedy about a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

But the country's government has vehemently denied this.  

During a television interview at the weekend, a man who went by the name 'Ryan' said he, and a small group, launched the Christmas Day cyber attack on the computer games consoles.

A notorious group of hackers called Lizard Squad said it carried out the hack 'for the laughs' and to expose poor online security.

Ryan - who is thought to be a member of the group - gave an interview on Sky News saying a small team had masterminded the attack, adding that he understood 'it's a bit unethical'.

Speaking from Finland, he said: 'This attack was basically done by three people. We had a couple of people from outside the group helping with the attacks, helping us a little bit, but most of the traffic was coming from one or two people.

When asked why the group carried out the attack he said: 'Mostly to raise awareness - to amuse ourselves.

'Also one of the big aspects here was raising awareness regarding the low state of computer security at these companies.'

He added that he would be 'worried' if children 'didn't have anything better to do than play games on their consoles on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.' 

However, Sony heavy traffic  continued to cause problems for customers hoping to play their games, as thousands of users logged back on. 'From time to time there may be disruptions due to surges in traffic, but engineers will be working to restore service as quickly as possible,' the firm wrote in a blog post

The consoles rely on an internet connection for many of their functions. 

Parents were so angered by the issues with the machines, that they wrote hundreds of messages to both companies on Twitter accompanied by the message '#christmasruined'.

Ros Bruce said her ten-year-old son had spent weeks planning what games he and his friend would play together ahead of receiving an Xbox One for Christmas. 

The boy was sorely disappointed when he tried to download a game and was still unable to play it more than 15 hours later.  

A Twitter user from Scotland also called for a refund and said: '£450 later and the kids have an expensive plastic paperweight.'

Mark Haynes said there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie (pictured), 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing

Mark Haynes told the Daily Mail there had been 'tantrums, tears and everything else' after attempts to set up the Xbox One console he had bought for his children Archie, 13, and Olivia, 11, kept failing.

Mr Haynes, 50, from Ely, Cambridgeshire, criticised Microsoft's response to the problem after calling technical support four times only to be told by one staff member that the company 'had no idea what was going on'.

Popular games such as Call Of Duty and The Sims 4 were all but useless for frustrated gamers.

Microsoft's Xbox Live service, which also went down Thursday, was back online last Friday, although the company reported continuing problems 

Lizard Squad first announced it planned to take down the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live on Christmas Day in early December, describing itself as the 'next generation Grinch'

Analysts said the attack was a DDOS, or distributed denial of service attack, in which online networks are overwhelmed by traffic, leaving normal users unable to gain access.

One of the most popular features of the consoles is the ability to play against friends and other users who are in different locations. 

This feature, however, requires an internet connection and many players were left disappointed at their inability to use it.

While an internet connection is not required to play all games, new Xbox One consoles need to be online to be successfully set-up. 

Many of those who received the consoles as Christmas presents are thought to have experienced problems getting started. Furthermore, games on both consoles often require an internet connection to be installed fully, which was ruled out by the hack.

There are 48 million worldwide subscribers to the Xbox's internet features, and more than double that for the PlayStation, which has some 110 million.

Last month, Sony announced it had sold one million consoles in the UK just eight months after launching, with a sales boost expected before Christmas.

In an interview on tech website Winbeta, Lizard Squad said it had carried out the attack on Christmas Day to 'anger and reach the largest amount of people'. 

It claimed the attack was to highlight poor online security and that Microsoft had barely any protection at all for its Xbox online network.

This weekend it was also revealed how a gang of internet hackers claiming an affiliation with anarchist group Anonymous claimed it had leaked the details of more than 13,000 users of Playstation, Xbox and online stores including Amazon.

The hackers posted a document online containing username and password combinations. They also added credit card numbers as well as expiry dates.

The group told their followers that they hacked the account details 'for the Lulz'.

According to Dailydot.com , the hackers released account information from users of Xbox Live, Sony Playstation Network and Twitch.tv.

The hackers also released details they claimed came from retailers such as Walmart and Amazon.

They also released details from a host of pornography websites.

In addition they ripped Sony's controversial movie The Interview and uploaded it to a file-sharing website where it could be downloaded illegally.

They additionally claimed to have ripped a copy of The Interview which could then be downloaded illegally
