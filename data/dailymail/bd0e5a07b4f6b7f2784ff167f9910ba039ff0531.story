Gruelling: Christopher Carlson, 45, is alleged to have hit, kicked and choked his three grandsons during long hikes in the Grand Canyon as temperatures soared to 108F

The eldest grandson of a man accused of child abuse testified today that he secretly asked another hiker to call 911 during a long, hot hike in the Grand Canyon last year.

The boy said his vision and hearing became altered and mountains appeared to sway during the 19-mile hike on August 28, a day that saw temperatures soar to 108F.

He also claimed he fell down several times because of cramping.

Prosecutors alleged that Christopher Alan 
Carlson, 45, subjected his three grandsons to a gruelling ordeal, choking 
them and repeatedly beating them during hikes.

The child told the Phoenix court: 'I needed medical attention and I was hurting and he was hitting and pushing me and calling me fat.

'I was scared and it was hard and I was all weak and tired and kind of hurt.'

The child had previously said his grandfather hit him in the face, kicked him and his two brothers and deprived them of food and water during 'hikes from hell' in the Grand Canyon.

Under questioning, the boy also said that Carlson, from Indianapolis, would pinch pressure points in their back that 'kinda hurt' during the hikes.

The statements from the boy are the first he has made publicly about his grandfather, who faces six counts of felony child abuse.

The 45-year-old has pleaded not guilty in the case and could face life in prison.

A criminal complaint said Carlson put his grandsons - 12, nine and eight years old at the time - in circumstances 'likely to cause death or serious bodily injuries'.

The two younger grandsons testified in federal court yesterday and earlier today.

The middle grandson said earlier that Carlson discovered that the boys had hidden cauliflower, asparagus and fish in their van, but made them eat it even though the food had hair and other debris on it.

Another time, the boy said Carlson made him eat broccoli that he had tried to flush down the toilet.

However investigators have also said that 
Carlson told them the boys were overweight and he thought hiking in the 
Grand Canyon would get them into shape.

Defense lawyer Jeffrey Williams portrayed Carlson as a health nut who had a firm hand and wanted to show the boys the world.

After the long hike the boys were tired, hungry and thirsty, but Carlson only allowed them to eat healthy food like tofu, hummus and veggie burgers, Williams said.

'I suppose to an eight, nine or 12-year-old that might seem like child abuse if you like cheeseburgers, French fries and pizza,' he said.

'He wanted to get them from behind the TV, the games and fast food.'

The youngest of the three brother testified that he experienced cramping, nausea and hunger during the miles-long treks.

But he also told jurors that his grandfather took the boys on 'awesome' adventurous trips.

Between the two hikes, Carlson took the 
boys on a tour of the Hoover Dam, to rides atop the Stratosphere hotel 
and a Criss Angel magic show in Las Vegas, as well as Disneyland in 
California.

He also spoke of trips to Mexico, 
Belize, Honduras and across the western U.S. last summer with Carlson 
and his two older brothers.

The trips often included long hikes, 
swimming and fishing in the ocean.

Although investigators have said Carlson withheld food and water, the youngest boy testified that he and his brothers were allowed to drink water most of the time and snacked on celery, carrots, tofu and low-carb hummus during the hikes.

The criminal complaint said that one brother feared one of his siblings would fall to his death because Carlson forced him to walk on the edge of the trail even though he was cramping and falling down.

'There's nothing life-threatening about a
 blister. If these kids were abused they were abused by 
kindness and all the fun and trips they took over the summer.'Â

Another brother said that when he fell, Carlson picked him up by the throat and threw him to the ground, and another said Carlson had slammed his face into a rock.

Investigators said the boys were covered in cuts, bruises and scars that backed up their stories.

But Mr Williams told jurors yesterday the injuries 'are consistent with boys who are just normal boys'.

'There's nothing life-threatening about a blister,' he said. 'If these kids were abused they were abused by kindness and all the fun and trips they took over the summer.'

A ranger with binoculars spotted the group during their 19-mile hike on August 28, the same day a man died on another trail from heat exposure.

He reported seeing Carlson shoving the oldest boy and whipping him with a rolled-up t-shirt.

Rangers fed the boys and gave them water after one showed symptoms of heat stroke and the other two had signs of heat exhaustion and dehydration.

Under questioning from Williams, the boy said his grandfather was in a hurry on the August 28 hike to get to the top of the Grand Canyon so they could watch the sunset together.

The prosecution in their opening statement said: 'These hikes became a life or death situation for these children at the hands of the person that was supposed to be protecting them.'
