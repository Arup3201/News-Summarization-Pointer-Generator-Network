Tristan Chadwick, 36, pictured, has been jailed for two years for stalking and harassing a married female colleague after she ended their affair

A warehouse worker who stalked a married female colleague and threatened to ‘cut up her husband’  after she ended their secret affair has been jailed.

Tristan Chadwick, 36, pestered the woman for sex and bombarded her with hundreds of text messages after she spurned his advances in November last year.

During a terrifying three-month campaign of harassment he threatened to petrol bomb her house if she did not sleep with him and sent one chilling message warning: ‘If you don’t see me, I’ll cut up your husband.’

A court heard the pair met at a construction firm in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, last summer and at first the office worker was ‘flattered’ by the attention.

After Chadwick was made redundant, the pair stayed in touch and even agreed to meet up at a hotel last October.

But the woman, who has not been named, decided she wanted to end their relationship in a bid to save her marriage.

Chadwick then started to pester her with constant calls and text messages, which became more threatening after she turned him down.

The court heard she would wake up in the morning to find hundreds of abusive messages from him on her phone.

She became so frightened of Chadwick that she eventually caved in and agreed to sleep with him.

But the threats continued and the victim finally confronted him outside his flat, telling him: ‘It’s over. Leave me alone.’

She became so terrified she fled her home in Stoke-on-Trent and went to stay with relatives.

Eventually she came clean and told her husband everything and Chadwick was arrested in January.

After pleading guilty to stalking at a previous hearing, Chadwick was jailed for two years at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday.

He was also made subject to a restraining order, banning him from contacting the woman in future after the court heard he had problems with ‘women and rejection’.

In a victim statement read out in court, she said: ‘The whole situation has left me a nervous wreck. I can’t stop shaking.

‘I’m terrified of going to work. I struggle to eat and sleep because I’m so terrified.’

It also emerged in court that Chadwick, from Stoke-on-Trent, had a history of threatening behaviour towards women.

Police had served six separate harassment notices on him in relation to six different women.

Defending Catherine O’Relly said: ‘It’s quite clear that he is an individual who has problems with women and rejection.

‘There’s a history of difficulties with previous partners.’

She added that for the first time he had now started to acknowledge his problems.
