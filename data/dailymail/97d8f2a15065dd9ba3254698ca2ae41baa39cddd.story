In the rough and tumble of football more than a century and a half ago, the 40 players involved in each game were allowed to push over their opponents and even punch the ball to score.

Now a group of four schools will tomorrow play a tournament by the 1858 rules at the world’s oldest football ground - Sandygate Road of non-league team Hallam FC in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

The unusual games will be played as closely to the historic Sheffield Rules as possible under modern health and safety laws, and will be officiated by former Premier League referee Uriah Rennie, 53.

It is believed to be the first time 
that the rules - which prohibit scoring directly from free kicks - will 
be used in a match since the Football Association was founded in 1863, 
reported The Independent.

The
 handwritten rulebook - auctioned off by the world’s oldest football 
club Sheffield FC for almost £900,000 in 2011 - features 11 rules that 
include players having to wear red or blue flannel caps.

Back
 then players competed in 20-a-side matches which could last from one to
 three hours, and could catch the ball provided it had not touched the 
ground or been thrown from the touchline.

The
 game, which was originally derived from rugby, was very different to 
the 21st century sport but formed the basis of the Football Association 
rulebook which was published five years later in 1863.

The Sheffield Rules were put together 
with help from earlier regulations - in particular those used by Cambridge 
University and other public schools, who were the first people to play 
the game.

Modern game: It's debatable how well the top footballers of today such as Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard (pictured right playing for England against Brazil earlier this month) would have fared with the old rules

It was the Sheffield FC set which were influential in the rapid development of football over the next four decades, and the majority of modern football clubs were founded between 1858 and 1900.

'It's been a real eye-opener learning the original rules to referee this competition'

Uriah Rennie, referee

Historian Michael Wood told The Independent he wanted to use the experience of the matches tomorrow to understand why football evolved so fast after the original rules were put in place.

He said: ‘We are always told that football is the great sport of the industrial age. I would love to learn why the game developed so rapidly into the major spectator sport we know today.’

The teams in tomorrow’s tournament will play an adapted version of the rules, with 30-minute games of eight or 12-a-side - and will not be allowed to deliberately push their opponents.

Rennie will be wearing Victorian clothing - including a top hat - to officiate the games, and told The Independent it has ‘been a real eye-opener learning the original rules to referee this competition’.

Sheffield FC still exist and currently play in the Northern Premier League Division One South. Hallam FC are also an active non-league side and play in the Northern Counties East League Division One.
