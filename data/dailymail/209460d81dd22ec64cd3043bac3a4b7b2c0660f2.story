Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic clearly thought one day of pre-season training with a thick beard was enough as the Serbian showed up at Cobham cleanly shaven on Thursday.

The 30-year-old looked as though he'd spent the summer in the wilderness as he posed for a picture with Blues team-mates John Terry, Marco van Ginkel and Nathan Ake on Wednesday as they labelled him 'beast'.

Ivanovic looked in good shape during Chelsea's second training session of pre-season as he kept the ball away from Demba Ba and youngster Dom Solanke.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho looked on as the group of players went through their warm-ups before breaking into some small sided games.

Several Blues youngsters are being given the chance to shine before the host of players that have taken part in the 2014 World Cup return to action.

The likes of Solanke, Isaiah Brown and Lewis Baker will all be hoping to make an impression before the start of the new season.
