Joe Biden sought to make political capital out of presidential rival Hillary Clinton’s recent gaffes about her wealth by claiming that he ‘has no savings account’.

However, financial records shows that he’s not quite the man of the people he claims to be, with a savings account worth between $1,001 and $15,000.

The 2013 financial disclosure he made in May also indicates that the Vice President and his wife, Dr Jill Biden, are worth between $1,323,970 and $162,996.

Biden’s 2014 salary, meanwhile, is $233,000 – considerably more than the average US income of $50,054 per year – which puts him firmly in the top one per cent of earners.

Biden spoke about his personal wealth at the White House's 'Working Families Summit' on Monday.

'Don't hold it against me that I don't own a single stock or bond,' Biden said. 'Don't hold it – I have no savings accounts. But I got a great pension and I get a good salary.'

He declared himself 'the poorest man in Congress.' As vice president, Biden officially presides over the U.S. Senate and can cast tie-breaking votes.

Bill and Hillary Clinton also own a three story, 5,152-sq-ft home in DC that has four bedrooms, six bathrooms, two half bathrooms and a basement. The average home in their neighborhood is valued at $6,586,000, according to real estate website Trulia

Bill and Hillary Clinton's balance sheet has been estimated at between $50 and $100million.

Despite this, the former first lady and secretary of state told the Guardian this weekend that she is 'unlike a lot of people who are truly well off.'

And last week she tripped over her wallet during what was supposed to be a political coming-back-out party in conjunction with a book release, explaining how she and the former president had struggled to afford mortgages on their estates.

'Their estates – more than one,' CNN anchor Alison Kosik giggled Monday morning while reporting the story.

'I don’t know what to do with my millions,' co-host Miguel Marquez jabbed back. 'It’s very tough.'

Former South Carolina Democratic Chairman Dick Harpootlian (L) is a close ally of Vice President Joe Biden, which may explain his pot-shot at Hillary

Dick Harpootlian, a former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina, also smelt blood after Hillary Clinton’s gaffes.

He framed his insult in terms the fictional aristocratic Crawley family and their servants could understand.

'I don't know whether it’s just that she’s been "Madam Secretary" for so long, but she’s generating an imperial image,' Harpootlian told The Washington Post.

'She’s been living 30, going on 40 years with somebody bringing your coffee to you every morning. Is it more Downton Abbey than it is America?'

Harpootlian, like more than half of the Democratic establishment, backed President Barack Obama in his epic battle with Hillary for the 2008 presidential nomination.

He's also an ally of Vice President Joe Biden.

Clinton's handlers have done a substandard job of managing her image this year, setting up ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer with a tour of her $5 million Washington, D.C. home and its lush, Edwardian interiors.

'Swimming pools and Ming vases are just not going to resonate with working stiffs,' an Obama White House insider told MailOnline on Monday. 'Unless half the voters hit the lottery next year, they're just not going to be excited about her.'

Another told the Post that wealth is 'going to be a massive issue for her. When you're somebody like the secretary of state or president of the United States or first lady, you’re totally cut off [from normal activity], so your perception of the middle-class reality gets frozen in a time warp.'

Asked what Democrats should do, the adviser said: 'Panic.'
