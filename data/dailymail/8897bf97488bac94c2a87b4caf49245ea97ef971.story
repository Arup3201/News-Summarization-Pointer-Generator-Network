Sam Allardyce clearly won't be afraid to wield the axe this season.

The West Ham boss was larking about at the Weta workshop at Miramar in Wellington - the home of props, models and weapons used in the studio's films, including Lord of the Rings.

Both the Hammers and Newcastle players went on a tour of the workshop, with the likes of Haris Vukic and Sammy Ameobi posing with props.

Both
 of the Premier League sides are on pre-season tours of New Zealand, 
with the Hammers' first game ending in a loss to Wellington Phoenix and 
looking to bounce back against Sydney FC on Saturday.

Newcastle meanwhile play the reverse fixtures, facing Wellington on Saturday after thrashing Sydney 4-0.
