Skincare super-brand L’Oréal has promised not to make any further claims that two of its popular anti-aging serums 'target' or 'affect' genes, as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Comission's Bureau of Consumer Protection.

According to the FTC, L’Oréal is guilty of making 'false and unsubstantiated claims' about the anti-aging benefits of its Génifique and Youth Code products, which aren't actually backed up by hard science.

Jessica Rich, Director of the FTC said: 'It would be nice if cosmetics could alter our genes and turn back time. But L’Oréal couldn’t support these claims.'

You don't say: L'Oréal has promised not to make any further claims that its Youth Code (pictured) or its Lancôme Génifique anti-aging serums 'target' or 'affect' genes, unless they are backed up by hard science

L’Oréal, the world's largest cosmetics company, previously claimed that its Lancôme Génifique products, which sell for up to $132 a container, are 'clinically proven to boost genes' and simulate the production of 'youth proteins,' resulting in 'visibly younger skin' in just a week.

On the product's website, amid mentions of 'cutting-edge science' and claims that the serum 'recaptures the key signs of youth,' its 'proof' section is merely a handful of consumer testimonials, including, from an 'Anonymous' user: 'This is the most amazing product, I will never go without it again.'

As for L’Oréal's Youth Code serum, which is priced much cheaper at $25 a container, 'ten years of gene research' has led the company to claim: 'We now have the knowledge to help you begin cracking the code to younger acting skin.'

According to a print advertisement for the product - which begs the question: 'Imagine, what if you could grow young?' - the serum 'boosts skin’s natural powers of regeneration so it regains the qualities of young skin.'

Tall claims: L'Oréal has boasted that this Lancôme serum (pictured), which costs up to $132, is 'clinically proven to boost genes,' resulting in 'visibly younger skin' in just a week

Under the settlement, L’Oréal is now prohibited from claiming that its products 'affect genes' unless they are supported by scientific evidence, according to the FTC, and from making any statements that misrepresent the results of any test or study.

The cosmetics company, who launched Génifique in 2009, and Youth Code in 2010, maintains that some of these advertising claims were already discontinued some time ago. It also said that no fines had been ordered, and it didn't admit any improper advertising practices.

It's not the first time L’Oréal has been forced to back down after making over-inflated claims regarding its cosmetics and skincare. In 2007, it withdrew advertising in Australia which touted the 'wrinkle removal' capabilities of its products . And in the UK the same year, the company also found itself in hot water for claiming its Telescopic mascara makes lashes '60per cent longer,' in ad featuring Penelope Cruz, who was in fact wearing false eyelashes.

The Government-run FTC describes itself as 'the nation's consumer protection agency,' and 'takes complaints about businesses that don't make good on their promises or cheat people out of money.'
