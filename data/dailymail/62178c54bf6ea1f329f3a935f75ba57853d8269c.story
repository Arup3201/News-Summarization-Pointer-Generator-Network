It is hardly a secret weapon to strike fear into the heart of his opponent across the net.

But this was the list of ten motivational tips that Andy Murray hoped would inspire him to victory.

Some, including ‘Try your best’ which was second on the list, seemed to be a statement of the obvious for any sportsman, let alone a tennis player ranked No 4 in the world who has looked back to his best in recent weeks.

Likewise the exhortation to ‘Focus on each point’. Other tips were more straightforward, such as ‘Try to keep him at the baseline, make him move’ and ‘Stay low on passes, use your legs’.

But the list also included such seemingly baffling instructions as ‘Be intense with your legs’, ‘Be good to yourself’ – the No 1 instruction – and ‘Be proactive during points’.

And it is to be hoped that Murray won’t be including the sixth on the list, ‘Try to be the one dictating’, in his plans for when he marries girlfriend Kim Sears in April.

Murray was photographed consulting the ten tips, which had been scrawled on the back of a letter of support from his fans, during his quarter-final at a tournament in the Netherlands last week.

Unfortunately, they do not seem to have been much help for the British No 1, who was beaten in straight sets by lower-ranked French player Gilles Simon.

The photograph of the instructions was taken by Dutch journalist Wilfred Genee, who obtained the note after the match.

The scribblings provide an insight into the famously grumpy Scotsman’s mind and suggest he does try to think positively on court.

It is unclear who was responsible for the instructions, as his coach Amelie Mauresmo did not accompany him to the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam.

However, Murray revealed last month that he has been working with a sports psychologist, and the messages are all certainly positive and motivational. 

He has used sports psychologists in the past, although without too much conviction. 

‘I don’t think counting to ten helps when you are playing in the semi-finals of a Grand Slam on Centre Court at Wimbledon against one of the best athletes in the world,’ he once said, scathingly.

On another occasion he suggested that a sports psychologist ‘doesn’t know what it feels like or the best way to deal with things because they haven’t been there’.

But now he appears to believe they can have an important part to play in his career. 

He revealed last month: ‘I think when it comes to psychology it has to be something that the player wants and the player buys into.

‘When it’s someone else’s suggestion, in the past I haven’t felt like it’s worked. But just now I think it’s working well.’

Murray, who lost to Novak Djokovic in the final of the Australian Open a fortnight ago, was pictured looking at the notes in his courtside chair during the match as he lost 6-4 6-2 to Simon – the first time he has been beaten by the Frenchman in 13 meetings.

The paper his instructions were written on – a letter from a group of his most ardent fans – also suggests the famously dour sportsman has a sensitive side.

The letter read: ‘There are good days and bad days in tennis and we know how it feels when something going wrong way [sic], but you must stay strong, never give up and always believe in your dreams.’ 

It was signed @magicmurray fans.

It also urged him to ‘avoid haters’, saying they were ‘always proud of you’ and added: ‘We all believe that you will be number 1 soon… You will be our number 1, always!’
