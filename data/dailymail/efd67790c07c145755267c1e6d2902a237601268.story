The mother of a former Olympic ambassador who turned in her daughter after she claimed she saw her on television during the London riots left court in tears today after seeing her sent down to the cells.

Chelsea Ives, 18, will not appear again at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court until September 7 when the case will be committed to the crown court - meaning she will have to spend at least 21 more days in custody.

Ives, of Leytonstone, east London, is a former Waltham Forest Council youth Olympic ambassador,  and has denied charges of violent disorder, burglary 
at Vodafone and Phones4U stores and causing damage to a police car.

It is alleged that the talented 
singer and athlete hurled a rock through a shop window and then yelled 
to a friend: 'This is the best day ever'.

If convicted Ives could be facing a jail sentence. A raft of sentences over the last 10 days appear to show the courts abandoning guidelines and locking up looters and rioters for lengthy terms.

Many are tougher than the ones handed out to muggers, sex attackers and killer drivers – and are evidence that judges are determined to reflect public demands for the strictest possible punishments.

This afternoon her mother Adrienne Ives, 47, left the court building weeping, flanked by police officers. She said: 'It is an incredibly hard time,' before getting into a waiting car and being driven away.

The court heard that the teenager could face 
further charges after it emerged detectives want to question her about 
incidents in Hackney, east London, during the rioting.

Nathan Paine Davey, prosecuting, told 
the court: 'In the course of the last week other information has come to
the attention of the police about the possibility that Miss Ives was 
involved in other offences in the London Borough of Hackney and they 
wish to question her about it.'

Ives arrived at court wearing a grey Nike top and lip 
piercing with her blonde and black hair scraped back in a side pony 
tail.

District Judge, Nina Tempia, remanded 
the teenager in custody until September 7th

Judge Tempia said: 'If further charges need to be added to the indictment, all the matters can be taken together.'

Last week, Mrs Ives said it was a 'gut-wrenching decision to report her daughter to police, but said it was something any good parent would do.

She claimed she had seen her daughter on television with her husband Roger, 54, during the mayhem in Enfield, north London, on the evening of Sunday, August 7.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'Any parent who loves their child should find the courage to do what we did.'

'If parents keep their mouths shut these kids will keep rampaging through the streets.

'As a mother, I love my daughter. 
It’s not easy, but we hope we’ve done the right thing. It was a hard 
decision to make but it was a decision that any good parent would do.  
These riots happen because good parents do nothing.'

'Roger and I were watching the TV news
and it was absolutely sickening,' she said. 'And then we saw our 
daughter. I could not believe it. For a minute we did not know what to 
do.

'But then, what could normal honest 
parents do? How can you sit there and see that and say, "That's OK".

'I will be portrayed as a bitch – but what are you supposed to do? I had to do what was right. She won't thank us.'
