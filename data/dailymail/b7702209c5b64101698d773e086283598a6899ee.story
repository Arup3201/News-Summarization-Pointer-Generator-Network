Manchester United supporters were left frustrated on Saturday evening when the club's official channel cut out during the friendly match against Roma and failed to broadcast a Wayne Rooney goal.

MUTV's transmission from Denver had been running according to plan when it suddenly lost signal moments before half-time with United two goals to the good after brilliant goals by Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata.

United fans watching in the UK, via their side's subscription service which viewers have to pay each month to watch, were then left guessing as to what would happen next when the picture was lost.

As it transpired, it was dreadful timing for the club's in-house media channel as they missed the moment when Danny Welbeck was brought down to win a penalty. The Manchester United Twitter account attributed the fault to electrical problems at the stadium, saying: 'We apologise for any loss of picture on MUTV. This is due to a power failure at the stadium in Denver.'

Rooney converted the spot-kick to extend United's advantage to 3-0 heading into the interval.

The problem continued into the half-time break, leaving only a few minutes for analysis, although order was restored for the second-half.
