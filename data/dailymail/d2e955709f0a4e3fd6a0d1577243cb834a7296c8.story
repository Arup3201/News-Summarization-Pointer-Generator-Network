She and her husband had been trying to get pregnant for a year.

So, when this woman found out she was expecting a baby just weeks before Halloween, she decided to surprise her partner in a particularly creative way.

The woman, known only as Leslie, bought a black T-shirt picturing an image of a white human rib cage, before fixing an iron-on graphic of a smiling baby skeleton to the bottom of it.

Donning the item of clothing, she then waited for her unsuspecting husband to return to their home in Philadelphia and filmed his incredible reaction to the news on an iPhone.

She later uploaded the video to YouTube,  under the name 'Leslie A', explaining that she made a 'last minute decision' to surprise her husband with the top 'after trying nearly a year to have a baby'.

The footage, posted on October 17, shows Leslie holding her arms across her chest as her husband enters the house.

She then takes his bag while at the same time revealing her cleverly-designed T-shirt, but he is too busy greeting their pet dogs to notice it.
