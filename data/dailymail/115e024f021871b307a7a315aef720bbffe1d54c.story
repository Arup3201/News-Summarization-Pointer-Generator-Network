This rather usual looking character is Senhor Testiculo, which translates in English as Mr Testicle, he is the recently launched mascot of a Brazilian non-profit health organization which seeks to raise cancer awareness.

In case you hadn’t guessed already, Senhor Testiculo is focused on reminding men to check their scrotum for testicular cancer.

Cancer is a serious issue but that hasn’t stopped The Associação de Assistência às Pessoas com Câncer (Association for the Assistance of People with Cancer) in Viçosa a city in the Minas Gerais region from adopting this playful character.

Mr big stuff: Senhor Testiculo is the recently launched mascot of a Brazilian non-profit health organization which raises awareness about testicular cancer

Judging from photos on the association’s website, Senhor Testiculo has a busy time of it attending public event and getting photographed with men, women and even children.

According to the AAPC website, Gawker.com reports; 'Both children and adults loved 
taking pictures with the mascot, a friendly snowman in the shape of 
testicle.'

He might not be the prettiest mascot ever - that hair is particularly off-putting - but that shouldn’t detract from the seriousness of his message.

Senhor Testiculo has certainly attracted a lot of publicity well beyond the Brazilian city of Vicosa, but according to Brazilian newspaper O Globo the association is currently considering whether or not to keep him as their mascot.
