Listeners to the BBC's flagship news programme Today are used to a sober diet of political interviews, thoughts for the day and the shipping forecast.

But this morning fans of the programme accused presenters of 'sinking to a new low' after Sarah Montague and John Humphrys began quizzing each other about their favourite music and most embarrassing moments.

During an item on good music to listen to in the morning, Humphrys, referred to by BBC Radio 6 host Shaun Keaveny as 'The Humph', told a story about meeting Ella Fitzgerald and said it was his 'second greatest humiliation'.

Montague quizzed him on what his greatest humiliation might have been, suggesting it was to do with his getting a tattoo, but Humphrys refused to be drawn, and when he told Montague it was time to move on to the next segment, she replied 'Sod the timings'.

'Like drunk colleagues': Today presenters John Humphrys and Sarah Montague bantered on air this morning

'Is this Daybreak?' Radio 4 listeners took to Twitter to express their surprise as the presenters joked

Fans of the show took to Twitter to express their surprise at the show's diversion from its usual sobriety, with one suggesting it was more like breakfast television, while another wrote: 'Has someone lost the script?'

The banter, which Twitter user JD Penelope likened to 'a drunk conversation between colleagues', began after a discussion over which music was most suitable to play on early morning radio, if any.

Radio 6 breakfast show host Shaun Keaveny said he liked to play motown or funk, but said he understood 'the Humph's' disdain for music too early.

Humphrys went on to say he enjoyed listening to jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, and told how he met her in Cardiff as a teenage journalist and provoked her ire by smashing a mirror in her dressing room. 

He said: 'She erupted.  This huge mountain of a woman said "Get that kid out of here".

'I was 16....It was the greatest humiliation, no, the second-greatest humiliation of my life.'

Montague, who also referred to the veteran broadcaster as 'the Humph', then interrupted to ask: 'What is the greatest humiliation of your life, Mr Humphrys?'.

But the 70-year-old refused to say, urging his colleague instead to hurry to the weather report.

'Awkward': While some listeners enjoying hearing the presenters' japes, not all were convinced

Montague goaded him: 'It was something that went wrong with your tattoo, wasn't it?', to which Humphrys replied: 'Ooh, you heard about that?'.

He then pressed his colleague on her musical preferences, saying: 'Your favourite songs, go, quick,' to which Montague, who has a biology degree from the University of Bristol, retorted: '"Quick"?  God no, go away'.

Listeners surprised by the change in tone wrote on Twitter: 'Is this Daybreak?', while others wanted to know what the presenter's greatest embarrassment was.

However Humphrys was not to be drawn, and requests from MailOnline to discuss it, and his rumoured tattoo, went unanswered.

Earlier this week the 75-year-old presenter of BBC's Question Time, David Dimbleby, was shown getting a scorpion tattooed onto his shoulder.

The presenter, who has anchored every the BBC's general election coverage since 1979, said he chose a scorpion to fulfil a long-held secret ambition because his star sign was Scorpio.
