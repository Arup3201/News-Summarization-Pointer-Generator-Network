Justin Bieber has once again sparked controversy during his worldwide travels - this time by infuriating Chinese and South Korean fans by posting photos online of his visit to a controversial Japanese shrine.

The Canadian pop star put photos on his Instagram feed of Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo which commemorates Japan's 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals.

The shrine is highly controversial, with both China and South Korea viewing it as a glorification of Tokyo's wartime aggression, when Japan occupied large areas of China and the Korean peninsula during the Second World War.

Not happy: Justin infuriated many Chinese and South Koreans by posting photos online of his visit to a controversial Japanese shrine

In bad taste: The Canadian pop star posted photos on his Instagram feed of the Yasukuni Shrine which commemorates Japan's 2.5 million war dead, including convicted war criminals

The 20- year-old is on holiday in Japan with his mother and he posted a photo of the shrine on his Instagram account - tweeting the link to his 51 million Twitter followers.

One photo, of him standing in front of the shrine, was captioned, 'Thank you for your blessings'.

Another which read 'Good morning' showed a photo of him posing with a man in traditional Japanese clothing.

Backtracking: The photos of the shrine which have now been removed, sparked outrage among his followers

The photos, which got more than 585,000 likes, also sparked outrage among his followers.

The Yasukuni shrine was built in 1869 under Emperor Meiji in memory of the country’s war dead.

The shrine contains the remains of some of those commemorated, but is mostly a symbolic destination for relatives.

However the souls of hundreds of convicted war criminals are also enshrined there.

They include Second World War leader General Hideki Tojo, who was put to death for war crimes in 1948.

China and South Korea see the shrine as a symbol of Tokyo’s aggression during the Second World War, when Japan occupied large areas of China and the Korean peninsula.

Japan entered an unwritten agreement with China in the 1970s which suggested that serving leaders would not visit the shrine.

One user wrote: 'The Yasukuni shrine is dedicated to [those who] killed countless Chinese prisoners ... Japanese planned Nanjing massacre killed tens of thousands of people [in] China. Please face up to history. As a Chinese ... I am so sad that you visited the Yasukuni Shrine.'

Another incensed fan wrote: 'Maybe you are a giant in Japan and thats the reason why you like Japan. Anyway, please dont come to China forever, we really don't like stupid people.'

The photos have now been removed and Bieber wrote on his Twitter page: 'While
 in Japan I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful 
shrine. I was mislead to think the Shrines were only a place of prayer.

'To anyone I have offended I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I 
love you Japan'.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang, said he had not been aware of Bieber’s visit to the shrine, reported the New Strait Times.

But he added: “I’m not aware of this situation and I don’t know the political opinion of the so-called Canadian famous singer.'

'I hope that this Canadian singer after visiting the Yasukuni shrine can have a clear understanding of Japan’s history of invasion and militarism, and of the source of Japan’s militarism.'

Last year Bieber was forced to issue an apology after he was pictured kicking the national flag off the stage during a performance in Buenos Aires.

He insisted he had believed the flag was a top, and didn't mean any disrespect by his actions, which caused outrage among many fans in the audience.

The teen idol also ran into trouble after spraying graffiti on a wall in the same country.

A
 few months earlier he caused outrage after leaving a 'tasteless' 
comment in the guestbook at the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam.

The
 singer visited the famous home where Jewish wartime diarist Frank and 
her family hid from Nazi persecution for two years during the Holocaust.

After
 spending an hour touring the home, which opened as a museum in 1960, 
Bieber wrote a message in the guestbook, which read: 'Truly inspiring to
 be able to come here.

'Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.'

The Facebook post garnered hundreds of comments expressing dismay over the young pop sensation's presumptuous remarks.

Many described it as 'disrespectful,' 'disgusting' and an 'embarrassment to Canadians.

Further straining fraught regional ties: Yesterday a Japanese cabinet minister and some 150 politicians visited the shrine

China's
 ties with Japan have long been coloured by what Beijing considers 
Tokyo's failure to atone for its brutal wartime occupation of parts of 
the country and what it sees as whitewashing of atrocities in school 
textbooks.

Yesterday a Japanese cabinet minister and some 150 politicians visited the shrine, in a move that could further strain fraught regional ties.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent an offering to the shrine on Monday, just days before a Tokyo visit by U.S. President Barack Obama, provoking an angry response from China and South Korea, which decried it as romanticizing Japan's wartime past.

Yoshitaka Shindo, the internal affairs minister, along with a close aide to Abe, paid their respects at Yasukuni,as part of the shrine's annual spring festival that ends on Wednesday, the day Obama arrives.

'I'm sorry': Justin Bieber has apologised to his fans in Argentina after a video which appeared to show him kicking their national flag off stage during a performance in Buenos Aires last year

'As this visit was my personal visit, I don't believe that it will have any effect on the U.S. President's visit,' Shindo said. A separate visit Shindo made to Yasukuni earlier this month prompted an angry response from China.

Abe made a December visit to the shrine which sparked widespread global anger, with key ally the United States saying it was 'disappointed'.

But this time Abe opted for an offering, and not a visit, aimed at pleasing his conservative supporters while trying to minimise international criticism.Seiichi Eto, a special aide to Abe, told reporters that his visit and those of the lawmakers 'should have nothing to do' with Obama's visit.

'The government should not interfere with a shrine visit made by an individual, since that would infringe on their freedom of belief,' chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference on Tuesday.

'This is the fundamental thinking of the Abe government.'
