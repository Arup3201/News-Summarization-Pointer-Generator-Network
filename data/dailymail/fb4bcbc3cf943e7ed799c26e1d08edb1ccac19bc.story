Officials from Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery claim Robin Hood (illustrated) originated from Yorkshire. They state the county features predominantly in literature about the outlaw

Everything you know about the legend of Robin Hood may be wrong, after experts have claimed the outlaw was in fact a Yorkshireman.

Refuting centuries-old reports that the villain lived in Sherwood Forest in Nottingham, a curator from a Doncaster museum states evidence suggests otherwise. 

She claims literary references put Robin Hood firmly in Barnsdale, Doncaster and Pontefract throughout his life - and he was also buried in Kirklees, West Yorkshire. 

‘It's more than likely that Robin Hood was a Yorkshireman,' said Carolyn Dalton, from Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery.

‘Robin Hood's links to Yorkshire are far stronger historically, the oldest and most detailed stories give details of the north Doncaster and Pontefract area.

‘I think over the years Yorkshire hasn't made much of the connection. 

'In terms of where Robin and his men lived, history points to Barnsdale near Doncaster.’ 

Legend has always stated the leader of the Merry Men originated from Sherwood Forest - the stomping ground of his archenemy, the Sheriff of Nottingham.

But Yorkshire historians claim the earliest stories put his origins firmly in Barnsdale - on the border between South and West Yorkshire near Doncaster.

The experts argue Yorkshire boasts more points of historical reference than any other county, including the site where Robin Hood's remains are believed to be buried at Kirklees Priory, near Brighouse, West Yorkshire.

One of the earliest stories of the outlaw, The Gest of Robin Hood, is set in Barnsdale Forest, just north of Doncaster, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire.

First written down in the 15th Century, the Gest also mentions a church where Robin later marries Maid Marian, which is thought to be St Mary Magdalene, Campsall, in Doncaster, South Yorkshire.

And in another legend, the outlaw ties the Bishop of Hereford to a tree in Barnsdale and robs him.

One of the earliest stories of Robin Hood, called The Gest of Robin Hood, is set in Barnsdale Forest, just north of Doncaster, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire.

First written down in the 15th Century, the Gest also mentions a church where Robin later marries Maid Marian, which is thought to be St Mary Magdalene, Campsall, in Doncaster, South Yorks.

In another legend, the outlaw ties the Bishop of Hereford to a tree in Barnsdale and robs him.

This was said to have taken place in Skelbrooke Park in Doncaster, South Yorks., where a 'Bishop's tree' still stands, and it is the home of Robin Hood's Well.

Robin Hood's remains are believed to be buried at Kirklees Priory, near Brighouse, in West Yorkshire, too.

But the only early ballad to mention Nottingham is 'Robin Hood and the Monk' and few mention the notorious Sheriff. 

This was said to have taken place in Skelbrooke Park in Doncaster, where a 'Bishop's tree' still stands, and it is the home of Robin Hood's Well.

But the only early ballad to mention Nottingham is Robin Hood and the Monk, and few mention the notorious Sheriff.

Robin Hood was first referred to in the late 14th century, and in tales throughout the 15th century including Robin Hood and the Monk, and Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne.

During this time, there are also accounts of people taking on the name Robin Hood, or Robehod, to imitate the original, which is why there is some confusion over his true identity.

The tales place Robin Hood in the north, but refer to both Barnsdale and Sherwood.

Experts believe the legend may have derived from two separate sources, and could have referred to two separate Robin Hoods.

An epitaph recorded in 1702 claims Robin Hood was buried in Kirklees, in West Yorkshire, where the legend claims he was killed, supposedly by the Sheriff of Nottingham, and dates to 1247. 

Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery has unveiled an exhibition exploring its links to Robin to mark this year's St Leger horse racing festival. 

The town council is also inviting members of the public to support the claims in a visitors' poll.

Ms Dalton holds a 14th century dagger, which she hopes help prove Robin Hood was from Yorkshire. It is part of a wider exhibition that Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery has unveiled, exploring its links to Robin Hood. Nottingham already features a number of statues (pictured right) and tours linked to the outlaw

Medieval artefacts are on display as part of the exhibition, which opened this week, while the question of whether Doncaster can claim Robin will be decided in the visitors' poll.

Ms Dalton is also keen to set up a Robin Hood trail in the area.

Councillor Bob Johnson, Doncaster Council's cabinet member for tourism, said: ‘Robin Hood's links to Doncaster and the rest of Yorkshire are perhaps more convincing than Nottingham's, so I'm hoping the exhibition will be interesting and thought-provoking.’

This is not the first time a custody battle between Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire has been fought.

In 2004, Doncaster was accused of ‘jumping on the bandwagon’ when it named its airport after the hero who robbed from the rich to feed the poor.

The legend of Robin Hood is believed to date back to the reign of King John in the 13th century.

He was one of three prominent outlaws, including Fulk Fitzwarin and Eustace the Monk, but while the latter two were clearly identified historical figures, it is unclear who exactly Robin Hood was.

Forests during this time were covered by forest law and were protected as private places for the king, where he could hunt.

Many fugitives used these areas, however, to hide out and both Sherwood and Barnsdale Forest feature heavily in the legends.
