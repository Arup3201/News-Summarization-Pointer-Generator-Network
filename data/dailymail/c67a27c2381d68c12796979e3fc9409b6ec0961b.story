Russian diplomats are to demand access to a boy and a girl from Russia whose American parents want to reverse their adoption, claiming the children are 'mentally ill'.

Vladimir Putin's commissioner for children's rights has told MailOnline that the move by the unnamed couple from New York, as 'despicable' and said his country's consul must be allowed to see its citizens.

The couple have gone to court to ask a judge to end their legal parenthood of the 12- and 14-year-old, who are being cared for in state mental health facilities in New York.

They claim that when they adopted the children six years ago, via two adoption charities which then worked in Russia, they were not told the children had severe mental problems, and were falsely told they were brother and sister.

Case: A Long Island couple has asked a judge to void the adoption of their Russian-born children because they suffer from serious mental disorders. Above, a file picture of Russian orphans in Rostov-on-Don

The couple claim that although the children were reportedly described by the agencies as 'healthy and socially well-adjusted' siblings, the opposite was the case

A judge is to begin hearing their case next month. Their identities have been kept secret by the court.

However, Russia's Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov has now called for immediate access to the children, and accused the parents of failing to bring them up properly.

Astakhov made clear he wants the Russian consul in New York to meet the children, though under present arrangements there was no way they could come back to Russia until they reach the age of 18 and choose to do so.

'They remain two underage citizens of Russian Federation,' he said.

'They are protected by our laws. The Russian consul has a right to meet them, to access them. This is what must be done right now - to get access to these children. 

'This is what the Russian Consulate in New York must be occupied with now ~ to meet and chat with them.

'There is little chance to bring them back to Russia. The Americans will not give them away. The children can go back only when they reach the right age and make such a decision.'

Astakhov also accused the parents of 'covering their inconsistency by blaming the poor children, who have already been placed in a psychiatric clinic. This is despicable'.

He claimed the children have been labelled and are imprisoned in mental institutions. 'This is deceit,' he said. 

'They want not merely to surrender the children, they are seeking to cancel adoption, alleging the children's diagnoses were somehow concealed from them,' said Astakov.

'This is utter nonsense,' he said. 'The American couple had a complete dossier on each child and had the right to consult any doctor. They could have sought additional medical opinions if they had wished.'

The children were adopted in April 2008 through two U.S. agencies - Spence-Chapin and Cradle of Hope.

The parents are now asking Nassau County Surrogate's Judge Edward McCarty III to dissolve their adoption of the youngsters, dubbed Child A and Child C, who are now aged 12 and 14 respectively.

His outspoken comments come as relations between the US and Russia are at their lowest ebb since the Cold War, with adoption an especially sore issue.

In 2013, Russia approved legislation dubbed the Dima Yakovlev law, which imposed a ban on the adoption of Russian children by American nationals.

The law is named after a Russian toddler who died of heatstroke in 2008 after his American adoptive father left him in an overheated car for hours.

Russian officials allege at least 19 Russian-born children have died at the hands of their US adoptive parents since 1999.

He claimed that there were no such problems with other Western countries where parents had adopted Russian children.

'I think it is to do with the American mentality, their lifestyle and stereotypes,' he said.

'This is the way "the right family" should be, "the right children" should be, 'the right relations' between parents and children.

'This is where all these dramatic stories with adopted Russian children are coming from.

'Each time we hear one and the same thing - alcoholic conception syndrome, lack of affection syndrome. These are two topics they always make big [about Russian children when adoptions go wrong].

'And the third reason, which is becoming popular now as a motive of rejecting the child, is that 'it can't be controlled and he is a danger to our life and security'. 

The parents are  asking Nassau County Surrogate's Judge Edward McCarty III to dissolve their adoption of the youngsters, dubbed Child A and Child C, who are now aged 12 and 14 respectively.

And in an unusual move, Judge McCarty III has agreed to keep the courtroom open, citing public interest in the 'disturbing facts' surrounding the adoption. 

Home: The parents, who are from Long Island (pictured), New York, adopted the youngsters, then aged six and eight, in 2008. The children, now aged 12 and 14, are currently living in state mental health facilities

The case was first reported by the New York Law Journal. 

The judge said an estimated 20 per cent of Russian children adopted in the U.S. suffer from developmental issues, making the hearing one of wide public interest.

If this particular adoption is dissolved, the children would become wards of the state, which could see them either remain in mental facilities or be eligible for ­foster care.

Speaking in court, attorney Irene Steffas said: 'If agencies had to warranty that children are in good health, agencies would shut down.'

But she added that adoptive parents should be entitled to 'every doctor’s report, every shred of evidence about the child’s health and background.'

Adam Pertman, president of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, agreed that parents must receive accurate records so they are prepared for the challenges their children will face.

'They don’t get sufficient training. And they don’t get the support and services they need,' he said.

Over the past two decades, more than 60,000 Russian children have been adopted by Americans, at a total cost of around $330million.

In 2013, Russia banned U.S. couples from adopting its children in a move that was widely seen as retaliation for a controversial bill that President Barack Obama signed into law in December 2012. 

The couple's attorney and the two agencies involved have declined to comment to MailOnline.
