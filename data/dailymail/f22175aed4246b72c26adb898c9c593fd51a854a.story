Police in Jimmy Stewart's Pennsylvania hometown slapped a duplicitous duo with a robbery rap Sunday after the lying pair told two shift workers they worked for a fake reality show - You Just Got Robbed - and then stole a measly $20.

One of the truth-challenged muggers put an Indiana, Pennsylvania man in a headlock about 1:20 a.m. Sunday morning, while the other recorded the incident on a cellphone.

Randall Smith, 21, and Artie Goodwine, 18, were arraigned Monday before District Judge Susanne Steffee, who ordered the bungling duo jailed in lieu of a $25,000 bond, according to The Indiana Gazette.

A third man, who was not arrested, reportedly accompanied Smith and Goodwine, but did not take part in the robbery, police reportedly said.

'There were three guys standing there, and they decided it was going to be a good time to rob us because it was just us two,' one victim, Austin Harnish, told Channel 4 Action News.

'The guys put us in headlocks and said we were going be on a reality TV show. The other guy started filming it on his cellphone.'

Smith posted bail, but Goodwine remains in stir at the Indiana County Jail, located about 45 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, The Gazette reported.

The bizarre incident occurred on South Sixth Street outside Fox's Pizza Den, where the two victims work and had just ended their nightly shift. The robbery concluded when one victim flagged down a passing police car.Â

it was just us two.'

Authorities reportedly collared Smith and Goodwine
after a short foot chase through the small Pennsylvania hamlet of less 
than 14,000 people that is famous as the birthplace of actor Jimmy 
Stewart, of It's a Wonderful Life fame.

'The guy that was filming came up to me and grabbed me by the throat,' Harnish reportedly said in his dramatic account of the strange incident.

'I was like, 'Yep, there's my wallet, you can have whatever's in there' -- 20 bucks.'

Police said Smith hails from Templehill, Md., and Goodwine from Memphis, Tenn.

The Associated Press reports that the muggers attend a technical school in town.

Goodwine and Smith were hit with a raft of charges that included robbery, simple assault, resisting arrest, theft, disorderly conduct, and harassment, the Indiana Borough Police Department told The Daily Mail Monday night.

Court records did not list alleged robbers' attorneys.
