JOE AND MARILYN: LEGENDS IN LOVE by C. David Heymann (Simon & Schuster, £17.99)

The undulating Marilyn Monroe may or may not have been a daffy comic actress of offbeat genius — what C. David Heymann calls her ‘soft simplicity’ could equally have been the consequence of drugs, rather than talent.

But what is beyond dispute is that she had terrible taste in men, illogically believing that, if a chap slapped her around, this ‘confirmed for her just how much he cared about her’.

‘I can’t remember the names of three-quarters of the men I slept with,’ Marilyn once said — though she never forgot Albert Einstein, because he managed to give her the slip. Voice coaches, wig makers, casting agents, Sinatra, Brando, and numerous Kennedys: it was a catholic list.

The ill-fated pair arriving at a theatre together in 1955. Their marriage broke down after just two years.

‘Hollywood,’ Marilyn quickly learned, ‘wasn’t a place where an ambitious starlet could afford to be a prude.’ Maybe not, but a dip into the actress’s past suggests that what she hopelessly sought was a father figure — ‘paternalistic guidance’.

Marilyn had needed considerable strength of character to survive an upbringing that involved suicide, illegitimacy, incest and schizophrenia. Her mother was in the State Asylum, where she remained until 1967, five years after her daughter’s death.

Marilyn herself was sent to the Los Angeles Orphans Home. ‘Nobody ever treated Marilyn like a real daughter,’ says Heymann. ‘Nobody had ever held her. No one kissed her. Nobody.’ Not with genuine warmth and affection, anyway.

Enter Joe DiMaggio, 12 years her senior. He had been star centre-fielder for the New York Yankees, baseball’s greatest living legend, who’d won nine World Series championships and was the holder of a 56-consecutive-game hitting streak. He seemed a solid sort, who’d ‘combat Marilyn’s shortcomings and frailties’.

But he was also a colossal bore, as sports heroes tend to be. He once went to the Metropolitan Museum and came out saying, ‘art bores me to tears’. He now did nothing but drink, watch TV and chain-smoke.

Joe and Marilyn pictured arriving in New York from Tampa, Florida in 1961. The former baseball player disliked Marilyn wearing what he deemed to be provocative clothing.

Marilyn met him in 1952, and they were married two years later. She made the mistake of imagining his taciturnity masked fascinating depths.

‘If his remoteness somehow annoyed her, it also served to pique her interest,’ says Heymann, who is as unconvinced as I am about DiMaggio’s psychological enigma. After a fashion, the couple did have something in common — Marilyn was mobbed by fans and reasoned that ‘movie stars aren’t born, they’re created. Publicity is part of the manufacturing process’. DiMaggio, in his turn, had also known adulation.

He almost grew wistful as he recalled the atmosphere in the stadium, ‘having millions of people look at you with love and excitement while you stand alone getting ready to do something’.

Joe DiMaggio was the star centre-fielder for the New York Yankees and loved the attention that fame brought him

Here may be the place to mention another thing that drew Marilyn to him: ‘Joe’s biggest bat isn’t the one he used at the plate,’ she told Truman Capote.

DiMaggio was the son of a crab fisherman from San Francisco. He dropped out of school in 1930 to play baseball, and was known as ‘the Walloping Wop’. He’d been married before, to a singer called Dorothy Olson. If only Marilyn had found out more about this episode.

DiMaggio had grown to hate Dorothy for ‘playing the effervescent hostess to family and friends’, and begrudged her any personality of her own.

A woman, to his Neanderthal way of thinking, had to cook, clean, run errands, ‘be his sex partner when he wasn’t in bed with someone else. It didn’t seem to occur to him that Dorothy might have her own needs’. They were divorced in 1944 on the ground of his ‘cruel indifference’.

History repeated itself with Marilyn. Joe would scream at her if she wore a swimsuit — accusing her of looking like a whore. To him, women were always housewives or whores, nothing in between. He insisted Marilyn wore dresses with high necklines, and wanted to prevent her from appearing in films ‘that exploited her sexuality’. He expected clauses in her contracts to that effect, and demanded ‘an active voice in choosing her roles’.

DiMaggio read and screened Marilyn’s fan mail and didn’t like it when she had to kiss the leading man.

He tried to control her and, of all the people in the world, she was the one you couldn’t control — certainly not by force.

The tragedy is that, just at the very moment Marilyn was emerging as ‘a shot in the arm for Hollywood’ and world cinema, her boorish husband was intent on compelling and browbeating her to ‘quit making movies to start a family, have babies’. DiMaggio had violent tantrums: ‘He made such a racket and screamed so loudly that guests in a nearby room called the front desk.’

Marilyn would appear in the morning with her face swollen and her eyes red. ‘Joe kept her up all night, every night, yelling and screaming at her. He’d become an erupting volcano, spewing out lava and ash.’

Enraged because ‘his bride had surpassed him in popularity and renown’, DiMaggio did his best to destroy Marilyn as an artist. She began showing up late, upsetting the director and producers.

‘She started taking sedatives. . . she became addicted and began drinking, and the combination of alcohol and pharmaceuticals screwed her up.’ She couldn’t remember lines ‘or if she did, she’d slur them’. She would collapse, develop bronchial ailments. Delays cost studios a small fortune.

What DiMaggio saw as ‘the sanctity of a domestic partnership’ was thoroughly abusive, despite the romantic nonsense of telegrams, champagne and florists delivering a bouquet of roses twice a day when he was trying to patch things up.

His cycles of jealous paranoia and possessiveness didn’t stop when they got divorced after only 286 days, in October 1954. DiMaggio stalked and intimidated Marilyn, even breaking into her apartment — or what he thought was hers.

A distraught Mrs Florence Kotz filed a suit against him for ‘attempted burglary’. Marilyn went on to marry Arthur Miller in 1956 — another disaster. Heymann calls the playwright ‘cold-hearted, dispassionate, intellectually pretentious, cheap and afraid to give of himself. He had no sense of humour’.

Marilyn inadvertently killed herself in 1962 when she forgot how many pills she’d taken, so took some more for good measure. There were enough Nembutal sedatives in her cabinet ‘to have killed a herd of cattle’.

DiMaggio, who’d driven her to drug-taking in the first place, died of lung cancer in 1999. In his later years, he kept company with a mannequin of Marilyn, complete with ‘an almost indecent authenticity to the breasts and other erogenous zones’, which he’d designed and had manufactured for $10,000.

He finally had the wife he always wanted — a silent and obedient rubber doll.
