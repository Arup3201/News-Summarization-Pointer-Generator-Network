It is a common thread through many of the world's dominant religions that those who do not follow the same faith are  barbarians.

Yet new research has now challenged the conventional idea that belief in a powerful and judgmental God is necessary to form large, complex civilisations.

Anthropologists have found that belief in supreme deities often emerged after complex societies had already formed.

The stone heads on Easter Island (shown above) are thought by some to represent ancestors of people living there and could be an example of where the belief system helped drive the emergence of complex society

The scientists studied the development of religion and cultures on Pacific islands that make up Austronesia.

They examined 96 ancient Austronesian cultures - including those on Fiji, Tonga, Hawaii and Samoa - that had not had contact with Abrahamic religions like Christianity and Islam.

They often form a central part of most biblical stories, but it appears that floods, famines and plagues may have also helped to start belief in some gods in the first place.

Researchers at North Carolina State University found that belief in all-powerful and moralising gods tended to appear at times of hardship in human history.

They claim that believing in such a supreme deity helps to ensure people within a society live by certain moral rules that are necessary when living in harsh environments or in times of hardship.

The researchers studied the origins of 583 religious societies around the world.

They compared these to  climate, rainfall and plant growth data for each area to build up a historical picture of the conditions each society was living in.

The findings may help to shed light on how religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam first emerged and why stories of hardship play such a central role. 

Dr Joseph Watts, an expert in cultural evolution at the University of Auckland in new Zealand, said: 'We found 22 instances of high political complexity through out historically and geographically distant regions of Austronesia.

'The results presented here cast doubt on the widely held view that moralizing high gods facilitate the emergence of political complexity.

'Although beliefs in moralising high gods do co-evolve with political complexity, believes follow rather than drive political complexity.'

Instead the researchers found that belief in systems of supernatural punishment - such as vengeful spirits - tended to precede the emergence of complex societies and civilisations on the islands.

These tended to be belief in anthropomorphic beings such as the spirits of dead ancestors.

The researchers found that 37 of the cultures sampled had beliefs of this type while just six believed in supreme deities.

Those that believed in a single all-powerful god tended to be clustered in southeast Asia including the Bontok and Tagbanwa cultures in the Philippines, the Batak Toba people of North Sumatra, the Manggarai tribes of Flores in Indonesia.

The names of their gods are Lumawig, Mangindusa, Mulajadi na Bolon and Mori Karaeng respectively.

The researchers then used trees of evolutionary connections between cultures, deduced from earlier studies of linguistic relationships, to explore how the societies were inter-related and exchanged ideas.

Islam is often seen as having been a civilising influence on Arab culture in the past and millions now make the pilgrimage to Mecca, shown above, every year. But the new research suggests that ancient religions like this that believe in an all powerful God may have emerged after complex cultures had already begun to grow

Native Hawaiians evolved a politically complex society but without belief in a supreme deity. Instead the had a belief system that worked around the representations like wooden Ki'i statues, like those pictured above

They were then able to model how the different religions influenced the development of the political structure and cultural complexity in each society.

Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Dr Watts and his colleagues said: 'For beliefs in systems of supernatural punishment, however, the beliefs seem to help political complexity to emerge, although by no means guarantee it.

'We suggest that the concept of moralising high gods diffused as part of a suite of traits arising from cultural exchange between complex societies.'

Christianity has had a history of trying to convert those of other faiths that were considered heathens but it the latest research suggests that supernatural beliefs played a greater role in civilisation than was thought

However, Mark Pagel, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading, told Nature that he believed the key to increasing political complexity was language not religion.

He said that societies became more complex as networks of trade and reputation emerged.

Instead he said that all powerful gods perhaps were useful as a tool to help those in power to cement their grip on a society.

He said: 'As soon as you have a large society generating lots of goods and services, this wealth can be put to use by someone who can grab the reins of power.

'The most immediate way to do this is to align yourself with a supreme deity and then make lists of things people can and cannot do, and these become ‘morals’ when applied to our social behaviour.'
