A wannabe police office has undergone surgery to reduce the size of her 32GG breasts in the hope that it will increase her chances of getting her dream job.

Former model Hannah Sadowska, 33, paid £3,700 to increase her chest from a B-cup in 2007 after an eating disorder left her 'flat-chested'.

However, the mother of one, from Wrexham, Wales, found that her huge cleavage was a barrier to being taken seriously in the business world, and in October she had them reduced to a D-cup.

Hannah paid for a second surgery on her breasts to remove her implants, taking her from a 32GG (left) to a D and is now confident in pursuing her dream of becoming a police officer 

Last week, glamour model Price revealed she'd had her breasts reduced from a 32FF (left) to a C-cup (right)

Hannah says she wants to warn other women against making the same 'mistake that Katie Price and I did'.

Last week, glamour model Price revealed she'd had her breasts reduced by five sizes to a C-cup. She has had seven boob jobs in total, at her biggest she was a 32FF.

Hannah said: 'When I heard that Katie Price has had a breast reduction too, I wasn't surprised - I know exactly what it feels like when no one can see past your boobs.

'Now I want to warn other girls not to make the same mistake that Katie and I did. Buy a nice new car or treat yourself to a holiday, but don't waste thousands on massive new breasts.'

Hannah is now applying for a job in the police force, and is currently studying for a criminology degree at Glyndwr University.

She said: 'I could never have wrestled a criminal to the ground with my implants - they were far too large for my frame. I want to be taken seriously, not look like a stripper in a fancy dress copper's outfit.' 

Hannah said she always felt self-conscious about her chest after teenage battle with bulimia shrank her breasts from a C-cup to a B-cup.

'I was really chubby when I was 13 and I got really badly bullied for it - which turned me bulimic,' she explained.

'Over a period of eight months, I went from 13 stone to seven stone and my chest never developed.

'Even when I managed to put weight back on my breasts never grew. I resorted to stuffing my bra with tissues and chicken filets.

'I was really self-conscious, I never took my top off in front of a man and never wore vests.'

Hannah said she always dreamed of having a glamour model's body, with a bra size to match. In 2007, she took out a £7,000 loan and used more than half of it to pay for a boob job.

She said: 'As I went under I said to the surgeon "make my breasts as big as you possibly can - even if I die".

'I'd gone through years of bullying so to wake up from surgery with a pair of Katie Price breasts felt incredible.

Hannah's huge bust meant that despite running her own business and studying for a degree she struggled to be taken seriously and said people made assumptions about her based on her appearance 

Hannah also suffered scarring from where her uncomfortably large breasts had rubbed against her bra

'It took me hours to get up as they were very heavy. I had to get used to carrying all this extra weight around in front of me.'

Busty Hannah embarked on a career as a model and launched her own business designing and selling supportive sports bras for women who have undergone breast enlargement surgery.

In 2008, she gave birth to her son Alexander, now six.

But, struggling to be taken seriously in the business world, Hannah decided her large bust had to go. She said: 'When I walked into a room everyone just saw my boobs and not me.

'People always assumed I was going out every night and would sleep with anyone - that could not be further from the truth. I was a mum, studying for a university degree while running my own business - but I looked like a stripper.

In October Hannah Sadowska had a private operation to reduce her breasts by four cup sizes

'I also had some really horrible scarring where from where my uncomfortably large breasts had rubbed against my bra.

'I brought it upon myself. I wanted the glamour girl look and I got it. But it had a negative impact on my health and my life.'

In October this year, Hannah had a private operation to reduce her breasts by four cup sizes.

She said: 'I feel like a different girl - I feel calm, content and quiet. I'm a lot more together, now when I walk into a room I know people are looking at me and not my chest.'

Hannah has now has taken the entrance exam for a job in the police force - she has been to an interview and passed the medical examination.

She said: 'If I didn't change my look then no one would take me seriously as a police officer.

'But it isn't just the way I look, it is a very physically demanding job. My giant breasts would put me and my colleagues at risk as I would not be able to fulfil my role as a police officer.

'Once I pass my degree I will hopefully be accepted to the job and now I also have the look to go with it.'
