A woman who lost a two-year court battle over a family heirloom has claimed the ‘cursed’ £230,000 vase ruined her life – and that she is now being forced to sell her home.

Andrea Calland, 47, found the Chinese ornament in her garage and decided to sell it, expecting it to raise a few hundred pounds.

But the vase sold for a staggering £228,000 at auction – and Miss Calland became embroiled in a lengthy legal fight with her former mother-in-law over who should keep the money.

Her former mother-in-law, Evelyn Galloway, launched a legal bid for the money, claiming she had only lent the vase to Andrea and it was not hers to sell.

After a lengthy court case Miss Calland was made to pay £180,000 to Mrs Galloway and the legal costs have left her with massive financial problems.

The mother-of-three has claimed the five inch, gilt-copper vase is 'cursed' after the cost of the case left her bankrupt and facing eviction.

Miss Calland, from Ruthin, North Wales, said she has now been forced to put her home up for sale to clear her debts.

The 250-year-old decorative vase, made of gilt copper, was commissioned by the Chinese emperor Qianlong, and was looted from the Summer Palace in Peking during the Second Opium War of 1860

She
 said: 'It was an ugly piece of china, it was five inches high and 
tacky. It was something you would see in a Chinese takeaway.

'It
 has ruined my life, I wish I had never set eyes on it really, I’ve lost
 everything I’ve ever owned in the world because of it.

'I owe over £100,000 in legal fees, as well as all the money I have lost on the vase already.It’s ridiculous, I just wanted a few quid for my daughter’s laptop that was all.

'I can’t believe I had got myself into such a mess, over a stupid vase.

'If I go bankrupt it won’t be through choice, all my bills are up to date and I don’t have that much debt.

'I haven’t had a family Christmas with my children for two years, I’ve used all my savings, pawned my jewellery, sold my car, I don’t own a computer, and most of the contents of my house have gone.

'I emailed the new owner, who is a revered Chinese antiquities buyer. He believes it could be cursed because despite advertising it heavily around the world he couldn’t get shift of it.'

Miss Calland’s nightmare first began in 2009 when she decided to sell a number of items of bric-a-brac at auction to buy her daughter Phoebe, 17, a laptop for her birthday.

She took the items to Byrne’s, in Chester, where the vase was given a reserve price of just £500.

To her surprise it was bought by a leading Oriental art dealer for £228,000, who whisked it off to be displayed in New York.

But, after reading about incredible sale price on the front of her local paper Mrs Galloway recognised it as a missing family heirloom and began the lengthy two year legal battle.

The 250-year-old decorative vase, made of gilt copper, was commissioned by the Chinese emperor Qianlong, and was looted from the Summer Palace in Peking during the Second Opium War of 1860.

It was bought by Mrs Galloway’s father, James Alker, a keen art collector, at a sale in Birkenhead, Merseyside, in 1956.

He passed it on to his daughter Mrs Galloway, who claims to have loaned the heirloom to her son, Steven, 52, and Miss Calland in the early 1990s.

Following their split Miss Calland claimed the family never asked for the vase back.

In 2011 however a judge ruled she was not entitled to the windfall because the 18th century case was never hers to sell in the first place.

A wooden ornament that a couple used as a doorstop for 40 years has turned out to be a Chinese relic worth £250,000.

The nine-inch tall item is a carved brush pot dating back to the late 18th century, when it would have been used to store calligraphers’ brushes.

The unnamed couple inherited the ornament, which propped open their living room door.

But when they invited an auctioneer to their home in Hertfordshire to look at some other items, they discovered its true value.

Expert Richard Harrison spotted the doorstop on the floor and instantly recognised it as an 18th century Chinese brush pot.

He said: ‘The carving is three dimensional almost, and shows figures of little boys doing things like setting off fire crackers.

‘It is in superb condition, which is remarkable given what it was being used for.’

Although the case came to an end the freelance science tutor now faces financial ruin after she was unable to cover the extortionate legal costs, despite selling her possessions.

Her only asset left is her beloved home, a pink stone cottage in the picturesque Welsh market town.

'I have no sofa, no TV, no fridge, all that is left in my house is a bed, washing machine, and a one-ring camping gas stove to cook off,' she said.

'The next stage is that they are going to force my house to auction.

'I put my house on the market for £210,000 in 2009 straight after the court date.

'It’s now reduced to £170,000 because it won’t sell. The flooding has put a lot of people off, it is a known flood risk area.

'The next stage is that their solicitors have sent a formal letter saying that I have had all the time in the world with things and it is still not sold.

'I have done everything, fitted a new carpet, kept it decorated, it is in a good form.

'If it is not gone by the end of April they will force me back into court which is yet more fees I can’t afford.

'If it goes to auction and doesn’t raise enough to cover everyone else’s bills I have a serious problem.'

Speaking in 2011, Mrs Galloway said: 'The whole thing has been appalling.

'We could not stand by and let Andrea walk away with all that money. It is an awful lot and we had no idea the vase was worth that amount.'
