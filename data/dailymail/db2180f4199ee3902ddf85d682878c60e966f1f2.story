Inspiration and determination helped France take revenge against Australia with a 29-26 victory at the Stade de France on Saturday as Les Bleus look set to end a miserable year on a high.

Philippe Saint-Andre's team, who had conceded 95 points in three away defeats against Australia in June, were ultra focused this time around. 

Tries by Sebastien Tillous-Bordes and Teddy Thomas as well as the boots of Camille Lopez and Rory Kockott gave them a deserved win.

Lopez converted both five-pointers and four penalties, while Kockott added the other three points in the closing stages that ultimately proved the difference. 

Bernard Foley kicked four penalties for the Wallabies and converted the try of Adam Ashley-Cooper in the first half. 

With France dominant in the second half after some key changes saw the host beef up their pack, Foley's stellar services - he's kick 16 of his last 17 attempts for the Wallabies - weren't required until Rob Simmons late try gave his side a sniff of victory. 

But the Wallabies came up just short in what was another thriller between the two sides in Paris.  

France, who finished the Six Nations in fourth place before being thrashed by Australia in that hapless tour Down Under, nicely followed up last weekend's 40-15 win against Fiji.

Les Bleus take on Argentina at the Stade de France next Saturday while Australia, who beat Wales 33-28 last Saturday, will face Ireland.
