A wild beaver which is one of the first to be seen in Britain for centuries has given birth to three young.

Two adult beavers, one juvenile and the three young, known as kits, are now believed to be living in the River Otter in Devon.

The beavers were originally found to be living in the east Devon river in July last year when dog walker Lorna Douglas, 35, spotted one swimming around.

After being spotted last year, retired environmental scientist Tom Buckley set up three infra-red cameras to film the beavers, which led to the recent discovery that one had given birth to three young (above)

Following the sighting, retired environmental scientist Tom Buckley set up three infra-red cameras – which take photographs when they sense movement – along a stretch of the river.

He has caught them on camera several times since January and they have been filmed grooming themselves, gnawing at the base of trees and happily playing together.

The government had originally said the beavers would be rehomed, as they could be carrying a disease, but wildlife campaigners now hope to get permission for them to stay.

Mr Buckley, who discovered the beavers had mated after spotting the young on his latest footage, said: ‘I was so excited to see the female and the kit. It's fantastic stuff.

‘Our baby beavers have been born free and their freedom should not be taken away by imprisoning them in a zoo.

‘I'd be extremely disappointed if the government did that.’

Devon Wildlife Trust said it was working to get a licence from Natural England for the ‘non-native species’ to remain on the river.

Experts think the beavers most likely escaped from a private collection, rather than being released deliberately

Sightings of the animals in the River Otter were believed to be the first of their kind for 800 years.

Their presence suggests that beavers may be breeding outside captivity for the first time in centuries.

Beavers were once common throughout Britain but were hunted to extinction in England and Wales 800 years ago due to their highly valued fur, meat and for castoreum – a secretion of the animal’s scent gland which was used as a headache cure.

The ast few British beavers were hunted to extinction during the 16th century.

To return the creatures to the UK, conservationists have reintroduced them by using close relatives from Norway.

Between May 2009 and September 2010, the Scottish Beaver Trial released four family groups and one pair of beavers into Knapdale Forest, Argyll.

More recently, beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at Ottery St Mary and Gloucestershire - but none are unaccounted for and the River Otter beavers are thought to have escaped from a private collection.

They remained in Scotland but disappeared from the UK completely 400 years ago.

Experts think the beavers in the River Otter most likely escaped from a private collection, rather than being released deliberately.

The Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said the government was taking ‘precautionary actions’ amid fears the animals could be carrying a disease ‘not currently present in the UK’.

‘We are taking precautionary action by testing the beavers,’ a spokesman said.

‘This will be done with their welfare in mind.’

He added the department would wait until the kits were a suitable age before testing them for disease.

There are two species of beaver - the European and North American.

The adult beavers and their young have been living beside the River Otter in Devon since at least July last year

The European is considered ‘vulnerable’ and is extinct in most of Western Europe, with around 700,000 living in the wild in territories stretching from Eastern Europe to the Chinese and Mongolian borders.

There were several attempts to breed American and European beavers to boost numbers of the European species, until scientists realised they are genetically incompatible.

Conservationists have since introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the UK, but this is thought to be the first group found living in the wild.
