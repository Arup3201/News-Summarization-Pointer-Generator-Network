A hairdresser on a night out suffered 'terrifying' burns after drinking a girly cocktail which had been contaminated with bleach.

Lauren Murphy says she thought she was going to die after she took a sip of the 'pink kangaroo' drink while celebrating her mother's 50th birthday in a Tyneside bar.

She and her friends have now received a pay-out from the insurers of the bar responsible, more than two years after their harrowing ordeal.

Ordeal: Lauren Murphy was poisoned by a cocktail which had been contaminated by bleach

Miss Murphy, 22, was out with her mother and friends in February 2011 at the Raffles and Dantes bar in South Shields, which has since closed down.

One of the group ordered a pink kangaroo, made with tequila, vodka, cider, cranberry juice and orange juice.

Tests later established that the drink had been contaminated with bleach, which is frequently used for cleaning bar pipes.

One woman vomited immediately after taking a gulp, while others suffered throat burns and ran to the toilet to wash out their mouths.

Miss Murphy said: 'I went in the toilets and my friend was nearly passed out because she had swallowed her sip all the way down.

'The police were called and I gave my drink to the officer. By this time everyone was getting burns and I had bleach stains on my black dress.

'Three ambulances turned up and they shut the bar and we were taken to hospital.'

She took more than a month to recover from the poisoning, and has suffered from heartburn ever since.

'I couldn't swallow properly for six weeks,' she added. 'My mouth was swollen and my tongue piercing became all shiny.

'It felt like a ball of fire inside, it was terrifying - I thought I was going to die.'

Five women won Â£2,500 compensation each from the bar's insurer in an out-of-court settlement.

Their lawyer Steven Thomson said: 'We are delighted to have secured a settlement on behalf of our clients but disappointed a settlement could not have been reached without us having to issue court proceedings.

'As a result, this process has taken far longer than it ought to have done, but at least now my clients can put this horrendous incident behind them.

'Many tens of thousands of drinks are bought on Tyneside every weekend and in each case, the customer puts their trust in the bar or pub that the product will be safe to drink.

'I hope lessons will be learned from this incident that the safety of customers always has to be at the very top of the list of priorities.'
