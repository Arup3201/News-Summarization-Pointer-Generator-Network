Jonas Gutierrez could make an 'emotional' return to the Newcastle United first-team squad within two weeks - with manager Alan Pardew vowing to give him 'an even keel' with other players as the Argentine fights back to full fitness.

The 31-year-old recovered from cancer this year - having had a testicle removed in order to beat the disease - and was given the all-clear last month having undergone chemotherapy in Argentina.

And he returned to training with the Magpies this month following an extended recuperation period in his native Argentina.

Gutierrez, who has not played for Newcastle in 12 months, will be given every opportunity by his manager to prove he can work his way back into the first-team fold.

Speaking at his press conference ahead of the Magpies' trip to White Hart Lane for their Capital One Cup quarter-final clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, Pardew said: 'Jonas is one of those people who livens up the training ground just by his personality. Of course, with him recovering from his illness, that's been magnified.

'We are really pleased to have him back. He is finding his feet a little bit. He hasn't been around the ball much, but he looks in pretty good shape.

'We hope in two or three weeks, he will be in and around us.'

Having arrived on Tyneside in the summer of 2008 from Mallorca, Gutierrez has since made 194 appearances for Newcastle, scoring 11 times.

The winger was loaned out to Norwich City last season but is now back in the North East and is enjoying his fight to return to match fitness, according to Pardew.

The Newcastle boss continued: 'He is keen to get back in amongst us and earn his right to play in the first team again.

'Like any player, I have got to give him an even keel, and he will get that. Now it is up to Jonas.

'I know one thing: it will be emotional for him, and for us, when he does return. We are all looking forward to it.'

Gutierrez has also won 22 international caps for Argentina during his career, netting once.Â
