Two elderly men escaped with minor injuries when their light aircraft crashed and ‘cartwheeled’ down a runway today, before splitting in two.

The single-engine Piper PA-28 Cherokee plane landed upside down after plunging onto an airfield during high winds at about midday in Shotteswell, Warwickshire.

On arrival paramedics found the pilot and his passenger had freed themselves from the aircraft - and they were not seriously hurt. Only one of the men, in his 70s, required hospital treatment.

The pilot told fire crews that he had been caught in a strong crosswind during a routine landing exercise, which made the wing hit the ground first and the aircraft cartwheel down the runway.

Local resident Paul Fisher, 44, said: ‘I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the wreckage and they had survived. How they have walked away from that is beyond me.’

Another resident, who did not want to be named, added: ‘We got home after it happened and saw lots of blue flashing lights. I'm glad it sounds like the people involved are going to be okay.’

Warwickshire Police said the injured man was airlifted to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford for treatment, and added that the B4100 road nearby had since reopened after a temporary closure.

Probe: The Air Accident Investigation Branch is now investigating the incident, which happened at midday

And a Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ‘Although the pictures are very dramatic, one pilot has suffered a broken leg with the other walked away with only cuts and bruises.

‘On arrival the ambulance service had already been able to release the two casualties. Firefighters then had to make the aircraft safe as it was leaking fuel.’

The Air Accident Investigation Branch is now investigating. The other man is in his late 60s.

Shotteswell, which has been in use since the Second World War, has a grass runway of just under half a mile. It is regularly used by private aircraft, helicopters, microlights and training flights.

The Met Office has a severe yellow 'be aware' weather warning for wind in place today and tomorrow - although this only covers western Scotland and the north of Northern Ireland.
