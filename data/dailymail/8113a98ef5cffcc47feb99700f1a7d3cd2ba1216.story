Arctic explorer Bxrge Ousland is feeling on top of the world after he and wife Hege became the first couple to get married at to the northern most point on in the world.

They flew to the remote frozen frontier with a party of 15 - including the bestman, bridesmaid and a helicopter crew.

Bxrge, 49 from Oslo, Norway, said: 'The 
North pole is a big part of my life so I felt it needed to play some 
part in my wedding too.

'For me it was all about marrying the woman I love in a place I love.

'It was a very emotional ceremony. Everyone has said it is a very fitting location for me to wed because of my job.'

The couple endured temperatures as low as minus seven degrees celsius as they tied the knot earlier in April.

The
pair were forced to fly from Oslo to a group of islands just north of 
Norway, where they then boarded a Russian research aircraft to the 
Barneo base.

From there they hopped in a helicopter which took them and their guests directly to the north pole.

Bxrge added: 'It was my idea because I spend a lot of time in the arctic and it seemed the perfect place for me to marry.

'I mooted the idea subtly to my wife, Hege, to test the waters. And when she said it was a fabulous idea i got to work straight away trying to make it happen.

'It took a lot of organising. I contacted my Russian friend who helped set it all up.

'We had to get permission from the Norwegian church so that it was all official.

'Thankfully, we found a priest called Dag Henrik Berggrav who was willing to marry us.'

The explorer, who has completed dozens of trips to the chilly frontier, added: 'There were 15 people present in total.

'But that included the helicopter crew who ferried us up to the north pole.

'Just as it finished something truly bizarre happened - a solo skier just happened to be passing.

'The skier Mark came along and shared a glass of champagne with us and passed on his congratulations.

'It was very surreal - we were in one of the remotest places in the world and there was this guy casually skiing along.

'We then headed back to the Russian research base and had a big party there.'

Bxrge and Hege, 35, are now set to jet off to the much sunnier climes of Italy for their honeymoon.
