A family has called the police claiming their six-year-old daughter had five of her teeth removed when she went into hospital for surgery on her legs.

Sarah Morrison suffers from a rare type of brittle bone disease which has seen her suffer from over 200 broken bones since she was born.

She was admitted to Sheffield Children’s Hospital for surgery to have metal rods inserted to make her limbs stronger, but her furious parents say they were ‘horrified’ to learn five of her teeth had also been taken out.

Sarah Morrison, six, who has brittle bone disease, was admitted to Sheffield Children's Hospital to have rods inserted into her legs to make them stronger. Her parents claim doctors also removed five of her teeth

Sheffield Children’s Hospital says the teeth were loose baby teeth which needed to be removed as they ‘posed a serious risk to Sarah’s airway’ during surgery, and that her parents spoke to a clinician beforehand about all the care she may need.

However, Sarah’s parents, Philip Morrison and Sonia McCrossan, dispute this and the hospital is now carrying out an internal review.

Mr Morrison, 37, said: ‘After the surgery I was outside the hospital when my partner rang me in a very erratic state, crying and screaming.

‘At that point I thought Sarah had died. I ran down to the recovery room where I first got a glimpse of Sarah with a mouth full of blood. I was horrified.

‘They didn’t mention at any point that her teeth might be taken out - it wasn’t even on the operation consent form.

‘The hospital is adamant that baby teeth were taken. But two of them were adult teeth, I know because I have the baby teeth at home.

Her parents, Philip Morrison and Sonia McCrossan, claim that two of the teeth that were taken out were adult teeth and say that they have contacted the police about the situation

‘We feel mortified and let down.’

Sarah was born with osteogenesis imperfect – a congenital brittle bone condition - and suffered 30 rib fractures in the womb.

Doctors initially gave her just two days to live but she defied expectations to survive.

Mr Morrison, and his partner Sonia McCrossan, moved from Ireland to Sheffield to be closer to bone specialists at the children’s hospital but they’re now planning to move her to another hospital.

Mr Morrison said the family were told a dentist would examine Sarah’s teeth, but not that any would be removed. He also said the teeth taken were not loose.

Sheffield Children's Hospital (pictured) says that the teeth were milk teeth and that they were removed because they were loose and posed a serious risk to Sarah's airway while she was under anaesthetic

He said: ‘She isn’t going back there again.

‘Sarah has been going mad about the missing teeth. She keeps putting her tongue up there saying “they stole my teeth”.

‘It’s not the fact her teeth were removed. She has a gastro tube and it’s been difficult trying to get her to feed, now this will set us back.’

A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said they had been ‘made aware of an alleged incident’ at the hospital.

Police are to be kept informed during the hospital review but are not investigating.

The hospital says that it is carrying out an internal review but that no staff members have been disciplined

A spokesman for Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘The care given to this patient was done in her best interests.

‘She has a complex condition and had come in for a surgical orthopaedic procedure, during which five baby teeth needed to be removed while she was under general anaesthetic.

‘They were very loose and were judged to pose a serious risk to her airway. No harm was caused to her by the removal of these baby teeth.

‘Her parents spoke to a clinician before any surgery was carried out and the care their child may have needed while undergoing surgery was discussed.

‘As an issue has now been raised by her parents, we will review this as we do with any concern.

‘No action has been taken against any members of staff.

‘We understand her parents have raised this as an issue with the police and we will keep them updated as we would with any incident.’
