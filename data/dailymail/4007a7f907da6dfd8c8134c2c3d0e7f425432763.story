The man responsible for managing Sheik Fahad Al Thani’s racing empire insisted No 1 jockey Jamie Spencer has not been forced out of his job after the rider rode his first winner since announcing his shock plan to retire on Thursday.

The 34-year-old dual champion jockey released pent-up emotion as he waved his whip energetically whip after snatching a last-ditch nose-victory on Mind Of Madness in the Listed Roses Stakes at York.

Spencer, who will be replaced by Andrea Atzeni, has not added to a prepared statement since announcing he was quitting at the end of the season and performed a quick change and exit from the track after collecting his winner’s trophy.

Done: Jamie Spencer announced his shock decision to retire on Thursday after winning at York

Out: David Redvers, Sheik Fahad’s racing adviser, insisted Spencer had made his own decision to retire

But David Redvers, Sheik Fahad’s racing adviser, insisted Spencer had made his own decision while not ruling out a comeback at some stage.

Redvers added: ‘Jamie knows his own mind. It was absolutely his decision. His reasoning to me was very simple. He doesn’t want to be in a position where he doesn’t see his kids grow up.

‘He rode his first Classic winner when he was 17 and has been at it a long time. He is looking for a new challenge. In time, no doubt he will talk to you and give all his reasons. At the moment, I suspect he is taking a chance to breathe.

‘I can understand everybody’s surprise and disappointment that we are not going to see him in the Weighing Room but who knows? In two or three year’s time he might rediscover the hunger.’

Spencer is to work for the Qatar racing management and Redvers said: ‘He won’t be bored and underworked. He will be helping me on a day-to-day basis.

‘We have 54 trainers worldwide. He is not going to be sitting there smoking his pipe and wearing his slippers. He will be getting around the horses and giving us feedback.’

Redvers conceded that Spencer is leaving Qatar Racing after a frustrating year with another near-miss being the fourth place of badly-drawn Pallasator in yesterday’s Ebor Handicap.

Redvers said: ‘Likely looked the best two-year-old filly out and unfortunately got a minor stress fracture. Flaming Spear is our Guineas horse and has had a minor setback. It has been one of those years. If anyone of those had won impressively, no one would be asking questions.’

Congrats: Spencer celebrates after he  won The Gold Cup in 2011 riding on the back of Fame and G
