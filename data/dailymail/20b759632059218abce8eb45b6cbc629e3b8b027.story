The mystery woman photographed on a hotel balcony with Sir Mick Jagger earlier this month is a leading ballerina 43 years his junior, who he met two weeks before his girlfriend L’Wren Scott’s suicide, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Stunning American dancer Melanie Hamrick, 27, was pictured embracing the 70-year-old singer ten days ago in Zurich, where the Rolling Stones were performing.

At the time, sources close to Jagger said the tryst followed a chance encounter in a nightclub. But The Mail on Sunday has discovered that Jagger first met the New York-based dancer three months earlier – and 6,800 miles away – in Japan.

Melanie Hamrick, 27, met Mick Jagger two weeks before L'Wren Scott's tragic suicide however the exchanged contact details three months earlier when they met in Japan after the Rolling Stones played a sell out gig

On March 6 this year, Melanie and a group of other dancers from the American Ballet Theatre were allowed backstage at the Rolling Stone’s sell-out concert in Tokyo’s Dome stadium to be introduced to Mick and the rest of the band.

Melanie, who is a frequent user of Facebook and Instagram, excitedly posted messages and photos of her trip to Japan, but intriguingly, made no mention of the Stones concert.

A spokesman for Jagger has confirmed that the pair met when Melanie and the rest of her group were taken backstage. But a source close to the star stressed that his first liaison with Melanie did not take place until Zurich – and that the pair had merely swapped contact details in Tokyo.

The week before the concert, on February 25, Jagger had attended a special reception for the ballet troupe in Tokyo, hosted by U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, daughter of JFK and a long-standing friend of the rock star, but Melanie did not attend.

There was no sign of Ms Scott on the trip, though she had previously travelled with Mick whenever he was on the road.

At the time of the ambassador’s party, Melanie was said to be engaged to another older man, 46-year-old José Manuel Carreño, a fellow dancer.

She lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just three miles from the home on 11th Avenue that Jagger and Ms Scott shared. It was there that Ms Scott took her life on March 17, at the age of 49.

Mick and Melanie were pictured on the balcony of his sprawling penthouse at the five-star Dolder Grand Hotel in Zurich earlier this month, looking as though they had just got out of bed.

Mick, who himself took up ballet several years ago to keep fit, was in a blue V-necked sweater, while Melanie grinned next to him in a short-sleeved top with slashed sleeves.

During the afternoon he ventured out bare chested and alone, apparently to talk on the phone. Five hours later he was seen wearing a smart, striped shirt and trousers as the dancer stood beside him clutching a glass of water.

The following morning they looked more dishevelled as she stole a kiss from him while sat outside the £2,250-a-night suite.

Friends of Melanie, who has a penchant for older men, did not know why she was in Zurich, believing she flew to Switzerland alone.

One said: ‘Ever since the photos emerged Mel has kept her head down hardly stepping out from her apartment. Talk has been rife about their fling with many believing it wasn’t just a coincidence the two were in Zurich together following the ambassador’s reception in Japan.

‘We all knew it was Mel but many others got the wrong end of the stick when they thought it was principal dancer Diana Vishneva.

'People put two and two together and came up with five because Diana was pictured meeting Mick during the party in Tokyo. But it was Mel on the balcony. They can look quite similar.’

On Friday Melanie braved torrential rain to step out from her New York apartment to do some shopping. Wearing a grey leather jacket, white T-shirt and skinny blue jeans, she had her hair tied back in the same style she wore when with Mick.

After being approached by The Mail on Sunday, Melanie told a friend: ‘They’ve found me, they’ve found me!’ But she refused to comment directly.

She has been romantically involved with Carreño for six years, and engaged since May 2011.

They met in 2004, when she joined the American Ballet Theatre at the age of 17. He was then the Broadway-based company’s premier danseur.

A father of two, who was previously married to fellow Cuban dancer Ana Lourdes Novoa, Carreño has been the principal dancer with the English National Ballet and the Royal Ballet, and has appeared on Dancing With The Stars, America’s version of Strictly Come Dancing.

But earlier this year he moved to California – 2,500 miles from Melanie – after taking a job as artistic director of Ballet San Jose.

In an interview in February, the San Francisco Chronicle wrote: ‘Carreno talks like a person who has come to the South Bay for the long run, which meant leaving behind his fiancee, American Ballet Theatre dancer Melanie Hamrick.’

Melanie’s friends have also noted that she has recently stopped wearing the engagement ring she once sported.

Jagger was flooded with messages of support after Ms Scott, his girlfriend of 13 years, committed suicide while he was touring with the Stones in Australia.

Soon afterwards, he issued a statement saying: ‘I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way.

‘We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves... I will never forget her.’

But the images of the great-grandfather being hugged and kissed by Melanie, who describes herself as ‘goofy and awkward’, left Ms Scott’s family seething.

Speaking from her home in Utah, her  sister Jan Shane said: ‘These pictures make me really wonder what Mick is really thinking and feeling.

‘His daughter says that he is still heartbroken and so devastated about losing my sister – and then you see these photos.

'He will never change. And people wonder why L’Wren was so depressed? The more I think about it – the more angry it makes me.

‘My sister deserves so much more respect than that. It hasn’t even been three months. I now believe that he was a bigger part of her troubles that no one knew about. I am so hurt to know that she was so sad and hurting inside and felt that she had nowhere to go.’

In the days following Ms Scott’s death it emerged her business based in London had been battling crippling debts.

The latest accounts for LS Fashion Ltd, filed in the UK in October 2013, showed the firm had a deficit of £3.5 million. Her company also owed creditors £4.6 million.

The label had been haemorrhaging money for several years despite Mick, worth £200 million, repeatedly bailing her out.

The Tokyo concert was the first time Jagger and the Rolling Stones had played Japan in eight years

The Stones are due to play in Vienna tomorrow night as they continue their 14 On Fire world tour.

Since the band resumed the tour following Ms Scott’s death, rumours have been rife the father-of-seven has been entertained by several women after the shows.

Friends claimed Mick, while performing in Berlin last week, spent the night with an old flame after arranging to meet her in the German capital.

And actress and singer Noa Tishby posted a picture on the internet of herself and Jagger sharing a joke in a hotel room during the Stones’ stay in Israel a fortnight ago.

A source close to the band said: ‘Mick’s way of dealing with L’Wren’s death was to get back on stage as soon as possible. It wasn’t long though before he was up to his old tricks.

‘The girl in Zurich was just a brief fling but she isn’t the first and won’t be the last. Mick is like an old dog who can’t be taught new tricks. Even before he started singing he was a womaniser and he still is. He knows no other way.

‘I’m not sure what the girl in Zurich thinks, but she is a goner.’

Perhaps all the travelling to be with Mick has affected Melanie’s performances on stage. A review last week of American Ballet Theatre’s production of Cinderella, singled her out for having ‘lamentably weak’ feet in her role as the Winter Fairy.
