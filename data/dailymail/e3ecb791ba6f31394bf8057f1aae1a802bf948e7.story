While Louis van Gaal has been criticised for giving Wayne Rooney a new position this season, the decision by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers to take Emre Can out of midfield and put him into a three-man defence seems to have been the making of the £10million German Under 21 international.

From being ridiculed as a plodding central midfield player with the turning capabilities of the QE2, Can is now being compared to Alan Hansen and all the other great Liverpool defenders who were comfortable on the ball and used as a springboard for attacks.

He's gone from Reliant Robin to Rolls Royce, which is how Rodgers described the 21-year-old after snuffing out Everton in the Merseyside derby a couple of weeks ago.

Emre Can (here holding off Tottenham's Eric Dier) has found a new lease of life in a back three at Liverpool

Can was described as performing like a 'Rolls Royce' against Everton by manager Brendan Rodgers 

Can was also man-of-the-match when Liverpool beat Spurs 3-2 on Tuesday night ahead of Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round tie against Crystal Palace, when Rodgers faces a big decision whether to leave Can at the back or restore him in the middle to cover for the injured Steven Gerrard.

Liverpool have lost only once in 11 games in 2015 and Rodgers will be reluctant to change things around too much. After the recent goalless draw at Everton in which Can stopped Romelu Lukaku, the manager said: 'He was like a Rolls Royce. He's only 21 and defended fantastically.'

Once derided, Can is now regarded as a force of nature by fans on The Kop and whatever the manager chooses to do it is a different Can to the one who struggled immediately following his summer move from Bayer Leverkusen.

Tall and powerfully-built, Can was injured just 20 minutes into his pre-season debut at Preston North End, hobbling off with a calf problem. No sooner had he recovered from that, he injured his ankle on international duty.

Rodgers must take credit for recognising Can's aptitude for playing in a three-man defence

In between the knocks, he appeared to struggle with the pace of the English game. Last season's Premier League runners-up started the season badly and Can, signed from Bayer Leverkusen, was lumped together with Dejan Lovren, Lazar Markovic, Mario Balotelli and other overpriced summer buys.

A great strike against Chelsea at Anfield in November was the first real glimpse of his potential but it was only when he dropped further back that things really began to take off.

Lovren was axed and Can slotted in alongside Mamadou Sakho and Martin Skrtel where his calmness on the ball and reading of the game have helped Liverpool stop leaking goals.

He was the victim of Diego Costa's stamp in the Capital One Cup semi-final – a sure sign he was getting under the Chelsea striker's skin.

Gareth Bale was moved further forward from left back and flourished at Tottenham Hotspur

Managers regard it as a badge of honour when they spot a player could do well in a new position. Harry Redknapp was praised for pushing left back Gareth Bale further forward at Spurs and the winger became the world's most expensive player when he moved to Real Madrid.

A less spectacular example, but one remembered fondly by Liverpool fans, is Rafa Benitez converting Dirk Kuyt from striker to right-sided midfield player where his phenomenal work-rate gave the team balance, while still chipping with the odd goal.

It will be interesting to see where Can's career develops from here. Gerrard's departure in the summer means there will be a vacancy for a holding midfielder who can pass the ball. But if it's deemed Can lacks the necessary speed to do that job, he now has another string to his bow.

GARETH BALE

Went 24 Premier League games without a win at left-back but ended 'The curse of Gareth Bale' after he converted into a winger, scoring a hat-trick against Inter Milan and sealing an £86million move from Spurs to Real Madrid.

DIRK KUYT

Signed by Rafa Benitez at Liverpool as a striker but when it became clear he wouldn't score enough goals in English football, he played wide-right and ended up becoming a cult figure in his six seasons at Anfield.

PAUL MERSON 

Merson was a striker when he first won the league championship with Arsenal but it became clear over time his passing ability coupled with a lack of blistering pace would make him more suited to midfield. George Graham switched him and he had more than a decade's success there with Arsenal, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth and England.

RYAN GIGGS

A flying winger who relied on his pace throughout his teens and twenties, Giggs re-invented himself as a clever central midfielder in his later years at Manchester United, enabling him to play on until he was 40.

GARETH BARRY 

Like his former Aston Villa and England team-mate James Milner, has virtually played in every outfield position in his career. Barry started as a full back, made his name for England as a wide player because of his crossing ability but spent the most successful period of his career as a holding midfielder for Manchester City and now Everton.
