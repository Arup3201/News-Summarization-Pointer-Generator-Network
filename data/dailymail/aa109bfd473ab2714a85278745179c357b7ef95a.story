A glorious set of photographs shows how fog gave rearing horses a mysterious appearance as Britain woke up to another cold winterâ€™s morning today.

The animals were pictured in Sapperton, Gloucestershire, while early morning fog was also seen lifting above trees at Bradgate Park in Leicestershire.
