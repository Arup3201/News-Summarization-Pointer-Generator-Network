A high school principal who hypnotised pupils faces up to a year in jail after being charged with carrying out the practice without a license.

Dr George Kenney, 51, hypnotised 75 students, teachers and their families in private sessions at North Port High School in Sarasota, Florida.

George Kenney was suspended after he admitted hypnotising a 16-year-old boy who a day later committed suicide. The teacher has denied any wrongdoing.

He also hypnotised
another student who killed herself and a 16-year-old who died in a car 
crash days after seeing the principal for private sessions.

The headteacher was removed from his post by school authorities and given an administrative role. A spokesman told ABC that he will resign in June when his contract is up but that no further action will be taken by the district.

If found guilty, the two misdemeanor charges could put Dr Kenney in prison for a year. 

Kenney came under the spotlight after student Wesley McKinley, 16, was found dead in an abandoned house from a 
suspected drugs overdose in April 2011. The day before he killed himself
he underwent a hypnosis session with Mr Kenney.

An investigation by officials following the April suicide of of Wesley
uncovered other students who had come under the principal's influence.

Kenney admitted to having hypnotised 17-year-old Brittany Palumbo five months 
before she killed herself on May 4 last year.

He also held hypnosis sessions with 
16-year-old Marcus Freeman six days before he died in a car wreck on 
March 15. All three were students at his school.

A report was filed by school chiefs last June 
who found that Kenney had lied to officials about hypnosis sessions and 
defied three separate orders to stop the practice.

He first told police he never hypnotised Miss Palumbo but later admitted he had lied.The report revealed Kenney hypnotized up to 75 people at the school, including students and their parents, as well as staff members and their children.

A teacher at the school, Linda Thornton, 68, was also killed in a car wreck while driving to work in November 2010. It is not known whether she was hypnotised by Kenney.

Kenney has claimed the students were 
happy to be hypnotised as it helped them concentrate in class. Many had 
been taking part in competitive sports and he said the hypnosis helped 
them focus.

Many pupils at North Port High School have come out to defend Dr Kenney and Facebook groups have been set up called 'Bring Back Dr Kenney' and 'Students in Support of Dr. George Kenney'.

One former student Eric Williams, 20, was the first person Dr Kenney ever hypnotised. He told Good Morning America that his SAT scores 'went up 500 points after the hypnosis'.

When asked about her fellow students' deaths, another former pupil Kallie Dremann added: 'They are just trying to pick someone to blame it on.'

He has published a number of audio CDs which are sold on Amazon. One uses hypnosis to help defeat anxiety while others focus on sports - baseball pitching and batting along with improving basketball throws.

Kenney became a certified hypnotist after attending the Omni Hypnosis Training Centre in Deland, Florida.

An investigation had revealed that Wesley McKinley, who had showed no outward sign of depression, got his mother's signed approval to take part in the session with his high school principal.

But his parents later said they had a 'ton of questions' and wondered if the hypnosis had played a part in their son's decision to take his own life.

According to ABC, private investigators hired by the school district interviewed Kenney, who has been at the Florida school for a decade, over the allegations.

The reported stated that the principal said he felt terrible about 'putting his school and his students through something that they didn't need or deserve to have to endure on top of all the tragedy they already have experienced" and started to cry.
