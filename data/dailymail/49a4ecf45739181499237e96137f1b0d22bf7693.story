Here's a piece of furniture you can really lay into - a sofa that flips to become a punch bag.

The clever design by German designer Tobias Franzel, named 'Champ' brings a cartoon touch to the standard couch, leaving exercise avoiders with little excuse.

While resting, the sofa's arm and punch bag lies flat on the seat, but it can be moved in to position ready for action within seconds.

Tobias, 34, said: 'I needed something to beat up whenever I'm angry need to release tension and it couldn't just be a normal punch bag.

'It should just be a casual thing, something on demand. Then the idea to combine it with a backrest for the sofa sprang to mind.  

'I wanted it to be comic-like, fresh and with a poppy appearance, and the shape just ended up that way.'

He considers each sofa a work of art, so each one is individually handmade, and retails at around £3,000 (3,600euros).

'It's made by hand, in single piece production in a signed series almost like a piece of art,' said Tobias. 

'I always choose the best materials and I pay the highest attention on quality. 

'The craftsmen are not in a hurry and are paid well so they can focus on doing a good job. It's really old-school.

'It's perfect for people who like to have fun and how off their specialities but not worry about the money. 

'It's different to other couches as it's extremely good looking and people will be one of only a few owning such a unique kind of object.'
