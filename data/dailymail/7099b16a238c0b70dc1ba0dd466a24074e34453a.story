Putting it behind her: Lily Allen has accepted an apology from a man who attacked her on Twitter

Lily Allen is no stranger to Twitter spats - but although her latest, with a serving soldier she accused of being racist, ended with flowers it was one of her more serious rows yet.

An official Army investigation, complaints to the Ministry Of Defence and a host of accusatory racist tweets from both sides meant the former singer even considered leaving the social networking site.

But today she announced the row was over after accepting a handwritten apology along with a bunch of flowers from Sniper Lance Corporal Harry Wilson.

L/Cpl Wilson, of the Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland, posted on social networking site Twitter: 'All the best with your new family just seen you bought s*** I meant adopted a child from Africa #hero.'

Allen, who previously suffered two miscarriages, then sent a tweet to the Army, saying: 'Do you condone @harrywil2010 racist comments? His profile says he is in the British Army. he needs disciplining.'

Allen, who Tweets under her married name @lilyrosecooper, reported the comment to the Ministry of Defence.

But this action opened her up to a heap of abuse from her followers and other Twitter users, who slammed her for reporting the message to the MoD.

One, called WilltheGer, said: 'What a rancid b**** you are! Trying to get a hero fired over banter.Of course you'd be ok if you didn't work with Daddy etc.'

Another added: 'We're doing a gig for Help The HEROES in Stranraer was wondering if you want to help.... Oh no wait you want them sacked..!'

And one called CallumAustin15 wrote: 'have you taken the hint that no one likes you and that your accusation is outrageous? Hope harry sue's you for every penny'

But she also had a few people take her side with one who said: 'If what he said was misunderstood then that's for army to investigate. Your not sacking him, Get a grip Harry's friends'

And another added: 'Don't remember @lilyrosecooper being 
linked with any adoption before squaddie t*** brought it up. Lots of 
d**** seem to be missing that.'

Accepting his apology: Lily has asked her followers to 'move on' from the incident

L/Cpl Wilson's page was removed from Twitter and the Army began an investigation, but his family said the message had been 'taken the wrong way', claming there was a comma missing.

His aunt Shirley Allison told the Scottish Sun: 'There is not a racist bone in his body. No way was it meant in a racist way.'

Rows: Lily has also been involved in Twitter spats with Cheryl Cole and Piers Morgan

But Allen, who is a regular tweeter under her married name @lilyrosecooper, has now told fans: 'I have just received some flowers and a handwritten apology from Harry Wilson, which I accept. I hope we can all now move on. Thank you.'

The Smile singer is no stranger to Twitter rows.

Last year she used the micro-blogging site to snub Piers Morgan's offer to appear on his life stories and started a row with singer Cheryl Cole.
