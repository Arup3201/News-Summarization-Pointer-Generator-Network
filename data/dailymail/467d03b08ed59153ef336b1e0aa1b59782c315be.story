Attack: Police are hunting for this teenager who is suspected of trying to break into the hospice and steal memorabilia donated by Gary Barlow

A thief attacked a hospice for babies in an attempt to steal memorabilia donated by Gary Barlow after the Take That star tweeted about his visit, owners believe.

The singer dropped into the hospice a fortnight ago with a BBC camera crew to film scenes for this year’s Children In Need appeal.

He donated dozens of signed pictures, records and books for the charity to auction to raise enough funds to open 24 hours a day.

Moments after leaving Zoe’s Place Baby Hospice in Coventry, the 43-year-old X Factor judge sent a tweet about the visit to his three million followers.

He said: 'Been to "Zoe’s place baby hospice" today and met some inspirational little people!'

But on Sunday, a thief was seen on CCTV smashing a glass pane at the entrance of the centre with a large garden ornament at 6.30pm - the first attempted break in at the charity.

Although the raider, believed to be aged between 17 and 19, left empty-handed, owners believe the high-profile coverage of Mr Barlow's visit may have led to the 'abhorrent' attack.

Fundraising manager Mick McCann said: 'It’s extremely difficult to understand how anyone could stoop so low as to break into a children’s hospice.

'We were told to keep the visit a secret but Gary was so touched by the people he met he tweeted about it after he left.

'As a result, local radio and media contacted us and we told them how he had donated items which we could auction which would be worth a lot of money.

'This is the first time someone has tried to break in.

'Whoever it was needs to be caught.'

Tweet: He told his three million followers about the visit with a Children in Need camera crew

Devastated: Receptionist Deb Lacey holds the broken ornament the thief used to smash the entrance

Happier: Staff were delighted two weeks ago when the X Factor judge chose to do a TV appeal for them

The break-in has cost the charity hundreds of pounds in damage to the glass entrance.

And the bronze statue the teenager used to smash his way inside was broken beyond repair.

No staff, children or parents were inside
the building at the time and the memorabilia has now been moved off the
premises to prevent another possible break-in.

Warwickshire Police today branded the raider 'heartless'.

A
force spokeswoman said: 'Any burglary is upsetting, but it is 
particularly heartless for someone to try to break in to a children’s 
hospice.

'We would like to identify the person in 
the CCTV as they may have information that can help us with our 
investigation and appeal to anyone who know who this person is to get in
touch.'

Famous: X Factor judge Gary Barlow tweeted: 'Been to "Zoe’s place baby hospice" today and met some inspirational little people!' and a few days later the hospice was targeted

First attack: There has never been an attempted break-in at the hospice which offers unique respite for infants

'Heartless': Warwickshire Police branded the abhorrent attack 'heartless' in their appeal to find him

Zoe’s Place Baby Hospice runs respite, palliative and end of life care to families and their children from newborn babies up to five-year-olds who have life-limiting or life-threatening conditions.

Called Zoe’s because it’s the Greek word for 'gift of life', the charity provides the only 'baby-specific' hospices in Britain.

There are three centres across the UK - in Liverpool, Middlesbrough and Coventry - which can each accommodate six children and their families at any one time.

Zoe’s Place is a registered charity and receives little Government funding - meaning they rely on public donations to help raise the £2.5million they need each year.

Anyone with any information can Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
