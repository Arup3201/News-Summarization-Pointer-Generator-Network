George Zimmerman has been investigated by police over allegations that he sent an 'inappropriate still shot photo from an intimate home video' of his girlfriend and sent it to her 11 year-old daughter

George Zimmerman has been investigated by police over allegations that he sent an ‘inappropriate still shot photo from an intimate home video’ of his girlfriend and sent it to her 11-year-old daughter.

The incident dates back to the domestic dispute between Zimmerman and girlfriend Samantha Scheibe at their Florida home last November.

When Scheibe meet with the Seminole Sheriff’s Office in Sanford on November 19, 2013 to discuss the domestic violence incident ‘Scheibe also stated that George Zimmerman had sent [her] 11 year old daughter an inappropriate still shot photo from an intimate home video,’ states the police report seen by RadarOnline.

Scheibe told police that ‘some time ago’ she had made a video that was ‘sexual in nature.’

She said that Zimmerman had found the video on her cell phone and sent it to his own.

According to Scheibe, he also took a still photograph from the video - depicting her lying on a bed - which he then forwarded to her daughter’s cell phone along with the message, ‘Ask mommie what this is’.

Investigators met with Scheibe’s daughter to view the photograph, but determined that it ‘did not show anything pornographic at all’ and ‘only depicted Samantha Scheibe’s upper body and a headboard in the background.’

Zimmerman was subsequently charged with felony aggravated assault in connection with the original domestic incident with Scheibe.

She eventually dropped the charges, telling police she had ‘misspoken’ in her statements to police.

The same police report revealed that Zimmerman has a formidable one-man arsenal - including an AR-15 assault-style rifle, a shotgun and three handguns. 

According to the police report, the handguns were fully loaded when cops arrived on the scene, and Scheibe said he brandished his shotgun when she started moving belongings out of the home that the two shared.

The report showed Zimmerman owns a semi-automatic AR-15, a Keltec 12-gauge shotgun, a Walther .380 handgun, a Taurus 9mm handgun, a Glock 19 handgun, more than 100 rounds of ammunition and countless gun holsters and bags.

Authorities seized the gun collection after Scheibe called 911 last November telling the dispatcher that her infamous boyfriend was pointing a gun at her and had smashed a glass coffee table when she said she was leaving him.

Zimmerman ‘grabbed the shotgun out of the case,’ she told police, according to the report.

‘George Zimmerman then pointed the shotgun at her and asked, ‘Do you really want to do that?’ Then she said she was calling 911, the report said.

He ‘struck a glass top table in the living room using the butt of the shotgun, causing it to shatter,’ according to the report.

Zimmerman then slung the shotgun ‘over his shoulder… pushed her out of the house and locked the door behind her,’ the report said.

Police arrested the unstable former neighborhood watchman and charged him with aggravated assault, domestic violence and battery. 

Authorities issued a restraining order against Zimmerman after Schiebe further accused him of choking her during a subsequent interview with investigators, but she later dropped all charges and claimed she had been ‘intimidated’ by police.

'Visibly
 shaken': Scheibe, pictured, was with Zimmerman when he had a showdown with his wife Shellie over their 
divorce last September

A friend of Scheibe’s told MailOnline at the time that loved ones feared for her safety.

‘We
 would all talk about where the relationship was going, and we knew it 
would end badly,’ the woman said. ‘He is just a time bomb waiting to go 
off.'

Those sentiments were also echoed last year by both his estranged wife Shellie Zimmerman, who also called him a 'monster,' and Sanford Police Chief Steve Bracknell.

Bracknell famously agreed with a local’s comparison of the risk posed by Zimmerman to Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza.

The smiling couple was the picture of happiness when seen a few weeks later leaving a local police department after picking up the guns.

The crux of his defense for shooting the unarmed Trayvon Martin, 17, was that he couldn’t defend himself against the teen.

He also said he also forced to flee a Miami Beach after people accosted him and a $10,000 bounty was placed on his head.

Heavy firepower: A simple attachment to the AR-15 owned by Zimmerman (similar to the one at left) allows it to legally fire 900 rounds per minute, and the shotgun is powerful enough to take down a fully grown deer

Concealed carry: Zimmerman also owns two pistols like the Glock 19 (left) and the Taurus 9mm (right) above, both can easily be carried by the owner in a manner that others can't see
