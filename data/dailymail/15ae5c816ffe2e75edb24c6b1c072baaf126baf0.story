Having just seen their club promoted to the Premier League, most Queens Park Rangers fans might be too busy celebrating to go house-hunting.

But, now might be just the time to do exactly that – for the uber-cool seaside mansion near the house of footballing legend and QPR manager Harry Redknapp has just gone on the market.

With its floor-to-ceiling glass frontage, swanky designer interior and indoor swimming pool complete with a sauna, the trendy property will set its new owner back a staggering £6.9million.

The ultra-modern four-storey, five bedroom mansion is situated near football manager Harry Redknapp's house on the Sandbanks peninsula 
which stretches across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset. It comes 
complete with an indoor swimming pool and has been put on the market for
 a staggering £6.9million

The 1,000sq ft. top floor of the mansion is devoted solely to the master bedroom and comes complete with a separate dressing room, luxurious en-suite and spacious living room. It also has a staircase leading up to it and a terraced decking which overlooks Poole Harbour, Dorset

The property, which has replaced a modest bungalow which was demolished at the site in 2008, comes complete with an indoor swimming pool, sauna and a gymnasium with a shower room

The ultra-modern mansion is situated in the millionaires’ resort of Sandbanks - a peninsula of just half a square mile of golden sand which lies between Poole Harbour in Dorset and the English Channel.

The ‘millionaires’ playground’ is the fourth most expensive property location in the world - behind London, Manhattan and Tokyo – and boasts other high-profile residents including Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis and Liverpool manager Graeme Souness.

This swanky waterfront property is the latest to go up for sale in the sought-after location – and there’s just a 6ft fence between the house and that of Mr Redknapp’s.

The football manager commutes daily from his waterfront home, which he bought with wife Sandra for £3million in 2001, to QPR’s London-based ground Loftus Road.

He’s spent the last five years putting up with building work on the neighbouring site where the four-storey, five bedroom mansion has replaced a modest bungalow which was demolished in 2008.

The property also has a triple garage and double carport with automated doors, professionally landscaped gardens, decked terraces which overlook the harbour (pictured) and a long, sweeping driveway

As well as the master bedroom which comes with a luxury en suite, two of the other four bedrooms also have their own personal bathrooms. Each floor of the house can be accessed via a lift which is featured in the centre of the house

Now finished, it boasts an indoor swimming pool and gym, luxury designer kitchen featuring contemporary Gaggenau & Miele appliances and a fully-fitted media room with cinema-style seating.

It has been put on the market with 
Poole-based estate agent Lloyds Property Group, which describes the 
property as ‘magnificent’.

Managing director Tom Doyle told the Daily Mirror: ‘It is a stunning house in an amazing position.

‘It’s
 totally ‘location, location, location’ as it’s right on the front and 
there are views across the harbour entrance to Studland.’

‘It’s like a property you might find in Dubai.'

Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property.

By area Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', boast the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London.

Sandbanks' popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel.

Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it  was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions.

The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand.

In July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre.

And earlier this month a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be now worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value.

Last month a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million.

In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down.

Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' s reputation has continued to grow.

Notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden also has a home there.
