Ghana's World Cup campaign has been thrown into chaos after star players Sulley Muntari and Kevin Prince Boateng were sent home following an 'unprovoked attack' on an FA official.

Both players were suspended indefinitely and ordered home from Brazil after a team meeting on Tuesday descended into violence.

Ghana's FA claim Muntari launched 'an unprovoked physical attack on Moses Armah', which resulted in his suspension, while Boatang was sent home for a 'vulgar' tirade at team manager Kwesi Appiah.

The timing of the suspension couldn't be worse for Ghana, who face Portugal this evening in a decisive World Cup clash which could see them eliminated from the tournament if they lose.

Suspension: Kevin-Prince Boateng (left) and Sulley Muntari have been sent home from Ghana's squad

The decision to suspend Muntari was taken in the wake of his alleged unprovoked physical attack on Mr Armah, who is a member of the Ghana Football Association's Executive Committee.

A statement released by the FA this afternoon read: 'The 
Ghana Football Association (GFA) has suspended Sulley Ali Muntari 
indefinitely from the Black Stars with immediate effect.'

A second statement, also released today, added that former Tottenham midfielder Boateng had also been sent home from the tournament after a furious showdown with team coach Kwesi Appiah.

‘The Ghana 
Football Association (GFA) has approved coach Kwesi Appiah’s decision to
 suspend Kevin-Prince Boateng indefinitely from the Black Stars,’ it said.

‘The decision takes immediate 
effect.The decision was taken following Boateng’s vulgar verbal insults 
targeted at coach Kwesi Appiah during the team’s training session in 
Maceio this week,' the statement went on to say.

'Boateng
 has since showed no remorse for his actions which has resulted in the 
decision. Boateng’s accreditation for the 2014 World Cup has been 
withdrawn with immediate effect,' it went on.

Showdown: Ghana coach Kwesi Appiah decided to suspend Boateng after a furious training ground bust-up

Ghana face Portugal in Brasilia this 
evening and they must win to stand a chance of progressing into the 
knockout stages, after earning only one point from the first two group 
games.

Muntari was already suspended for the game after collecting a 
yellow card in both of Ghana’s first two games. But Schalke star Boateng is considered one of squad's key players.

The news comes just hours before Ghana's president John Dramani Mahama is expected to arrive in Brazil with $3million in cash to appease players who are angry at being denied bonus payments.

There have been concerns that several members of the squad were planning to boycott tonight's match if they do not receive a bonus, leading the president to intervene in the matter personally.

And earlier this the president of Ghana's FA denied agreeing for the national team to play in matches
 that others were preparing to fix.

An
 undercover investigation identified two people, one a licensed FIFA 
agent and the other a Ghana club official, who said they could fix 
friendly matches involving the national side by bribing officials.

The report by Channel 4's Dispatches and 
The Telegraph claimed that Kwesi Nyantakyi had agreed for 
Ghana to play in two matches after the World Cup, but he has since denied the claims.
