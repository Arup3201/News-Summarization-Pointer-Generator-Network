Ohio's Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team held its postseason banquet in a hospital room in honor of their most courageous player.

The 19-year-old freshman made it through a full season at the Cincinnati university while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life. 

During her senior year of high school, Hill was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 per cent, according to The Cure Starts Now.

Made It: Lauren Hill, 19 (photographed), made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.3 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life

Despite the diagnosis, Hill decided to attend college and play for the Division III school. 

In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. 

Not only did she live, she played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups.

As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. 

The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. 

She's occasionally hospitalized for treatment now, but still holding to each day as tightly as she can and urging others to appreciate their time together.

'That's truly Lauren,' coach Dan Benjamin said in an interview on Thursday. 'That's the message she's been saying forever. 

'She's just thankful God gave her that opportunity and that role because she's the one that could handle it. And she's done it so gracefully.

'Even at the banquet, she comes in her wheelchair and she's all smiles. And that's truly amazing. 

I don't know what her pain level is or how much suffering she's going through, but the girl smiles every time she gets a chance.'

The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. 

Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital.

So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together.

'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said.

The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. 

The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet.

Life: Doctors didn't expect Hill (center) to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain

Doctors didn't expect Hill to live this long with the tumor, which folds around parts of her brain.

'The first diagnosis was December, around Christmas time, which is why I went ahead and tried to get the first game moved up,' Benjamin said.

'But that's Lauren. Lauren's not going to let it beat her. She's going to keep fighting.

'Everybody thought she'd be this small, tiny voice instead of this big lion roar. She's done a great job with that. 

And the money she's raised: Everybody thought she'd get some money, but $1.3 million is amazing.'

In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.'

Throughout her battle, Hill has been honored by several local teams and schools. 

Earlier this week, Hill was honored by Ohio Gov. John Kasich as a recipient of the Governor's Courage Award, according to Sports Illustrated. 

The freshman received and honorary doctorate from the school, Local 12 reports. 

The Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters has been bestowed on a few others before Hill such as Neil Armstrogn, Nick Clooney, and Bob Castellini.  

She was recently named chief motivational officer of The Cure Starts Now, a cancer research foundation.
