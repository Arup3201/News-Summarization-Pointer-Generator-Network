Eyewitnesses have described the harrowing moment when 'bombs fell like rain' during the worst violence seen in Syria since protesters began their uprising last year. 

More than 200 people, including women and children, were killed by President Bashar al-Assad's Syrian forces in the city of Homs which was battered by mortars and artillery overnight.

Wounded civilians took refuge at a mosque in the Khalidiya district which took the brunt of the shells fired by government forces.

Residents including Omar Shakir 
described a night of terror. He told the Sunday Times: 'It was like a 
machine gun shooting randomly, only much, much heavier.

'The bombs fell like rain. You didn't know where they would fall. You could only pray.' 

Several hospitals treating the dead and dying were raided by security forces, according to activists' reports.

The Syrian regime has denied the assault - accusing activists of engaging in a 'hysterical' propaganda campaign - while countries around the world spoke out against the atrocity.

A UN Security Council resolution was vetoed by Russia and China just hours after fighting broke out. 

The vote saw all of the other 13 council members, including the UK, US and France, vote in favour of the resolution.

Foreign Secretary William Hague said Russia and China now had 'blood on their hands'.

The international community was 'not contemplating military action' however, he declared.

Speaking to Sky News, he said: 'The main way forward now is for the Arab League to pursue their plan in any case.

'They do not need the permission of the United Nations, although it would have been good to have a clear mandate.

'They should pursue their plan, they should intensify their own pressure
 on the Assad regime to stop the killing and allow a peaceful political 
transition.'

Mr Hague said the UK and allies had made 'huge efforts' to secure 
support from Russia and China.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said the UN stalemate was 'a stain on the conscience of the world' - and called on Mr Hague to make a statement to MPs tomorrow.

Immediate measures should include hardening asset and travel bans and economic sanctions, he suggested.

And he said he 'would not rule out' joining any coordinated move to withdraw ambassadors.

Meanwhile, former prime minister Sir 
John Major told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show the UN should now not lead 
international efforts over events in Syria.

He said: '(Russia and China) are effectively giving the green light for a pretty bad regime to murder people.

'One needs to put it bluntly so they understand what they have done and so the world understands what they have done.

'If
 China and Russia have vetoed it once, let us see if they will veto it 
again as public pressure and international condemnation builds up.'

Tunisia's prime minister said that 
cutting ties with the Syrian regime is the 'least that we can do' in the
 face of escalating violence, and asserted that Russia and China misused
 their U.N. Security Council veto.

Hamadi
 Jebali spoke at an annual gathering of security officials in Germany, 
where Yemeni Nobel Peace Prize winner Tawakkul Karman also said Russia 
and China bear moral responsibility for killings in Syria and urged 
governments to expel Syrian ambassadors.

The Syrian people 'are expecting deeds, they are expecting concrete measures," Jebali said at the Munich Security Conference.

'We have to expel the Syrian ambassadors from Arab countries and other countries.

'The very least that we can do is to cut our relations to the Syrian regime,' Jebali said.

He also criticised the 'excessive use of the veto' in the U.N. Security Council.

'This is a right that was misused, and undoubtedly the international community has to reconsider this mechanism of decision taking.'

Karman, one of the winners of last year's Nobel Peace Prize, had sharper words for Russia and China.

'Those two countries bear the moral and human responsibility for these massacres,' she said.

'I urge you in the name of the peaceful rebels to expel Syrian ambassadors from your countries and I urge you to call back your ambassadors in Damascus,' Karman said to delegates.

That is the minimum you can do to punish this regime, and I also urge you to take the necessary measures to protect the Syrian people.'

Protest: Police force back protesters at the Syrian Embassy in London this week

The Syrian authorities have responded to
 anti-government protests with overwhelming military force since they 
began in March 2011.

Assad is trying to crush the revolt with a sweeping crackdown that has so far claimed thousands of lives, but neither the government nor the protesters are backing down and clashes between the military and an increasingly bold and armed opposition has meant many parts of the country have seen relentless violence.

The U.N. said weeks ago that more than 5,400 people have been killed in violence since March.

Hundreds more have been killed since that tally was announced.

Violence erupted at the Syrian Embassy in London yesterday.

Police using riot shields forced the demonstrators back after they broke through barriers.
