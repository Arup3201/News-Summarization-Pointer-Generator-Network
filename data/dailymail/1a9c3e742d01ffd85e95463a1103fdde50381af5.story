Jose Mourinho insists there is more to come from Didier Drogba at Chelsea as the striker says he wants to stay at the club beyond the end of the season. 

Mourinho led the tributes to Drogba as he was honoured for his outstanding contribution to the game by the Football Writers' Association at a Gala Tribute evening at the Savoy Hotel in London on Sunday.  

Mourinho hailed Drogba, who first joined Chelsea for £24million in 2004, as the club's 'best value player ever' and insisted the 36-year-old was 'not finished yet.'

Dressed smartly in a blue suit and bow tie, Drogba  followed the likes of Mourinho, Sir Alex Ferguson and David Beckham by picking up the prestigious award.

He said: When you have achieved so much and won so many trophies like we have done in the past 10 years, that creates something special. 

'I hope, and the club makes me believe, I am part of this big family, so we are going to find the best thing for both of us to promote the club in the best way."

'When I left this club (the first time in 2012), I was saying that I had done everything I wanted to do, but I think now that I did not do everything, I think there is more to do.

'I love this club and would love to be part of this club for the future, with the new players.'

Earlier Mourinho, speaking to the Football Writers' Association, said: 'I came to Chelsea in the summer of 2004 and in my first written report to Mr Abramovich in relation to my plans for the club, I gave the names of some players.

'Big names were arriving at Chelsea in that period. The previous summer, for example, Claude Makelele came from Real Madrid and Hernan Crespo came from Inter, among others, but Didier was unknown and the price was very, very high.

'Yet I knew as clearly as I have ever done that he was the player I wanted.

'I was very strong to persuade my club to pay such an amount for him and I think we can already say he was the best-value signing for Chelsea in relation to what he has done for the club over so many years, and he is not finished yet.'

Drogba has been recognised for his impressive performances on the pitch over the last 16 years and also his charity work away from it, with his foundation having funded many projects in his homeland of the Ivory Coast. 

The 36-year-old, who started in Chelsea's shock 4-2 defeat by Bradford on Saturday, expressed his gratitude at being picked as this year's recipient.

He said: 'I am really proud for this award, in the list of previous winners there are a lot of players whom I really respect and grew up trying to reach there level, so for me this is a great honour.

'When I came to England, things were difficult, there was the language barrier and culture change.

'With time, we managed to learn more from each other and today I am really happy that the football writers not only understand me a lot on the pitch, but have also helped me with my foundation work.'

Mourinho also revealed that he counts Drogba as his favourite player, describing him as a 'phenomenal' person.

Mourinho added: 'Throughout my career, I have always refused to say which is my favourite player or the best person, because so many have given soul and blood to play and to fight with me, but if I have to choose one who represents all the good things you want in a player and a man, I think in this moment I would choose Didier.'

'Didier arrived at Stamford Bridge for £24million, but he is probably the best-value Chelsea player ever, and I remember clearly how it happened.

'I came to Chelsea in the summer of 2004 and in my first written report to Mr Abramovich in relation to my plans for the club, I gave the names of some players.

'Big names were arriving at Chelsea in that period. The previous summer, for example, Claude Makelele came from Real Madrid and Hernan Crespo came from Inter, among others, but Didier was unknown and the price was very, very high.

'Yet I knew as clearly as I have ever done that he was the player I wanted.

'I was very strong to persuade my club to pay such an amount for him and I think we can already say he was the best-value signing for Chelsea in relation to what he has done for the club over so many years, and he is not finished yet.

'My story with him started after I got Marseille in my Champions League group when I was manager of Porto. 'Before we played against them, I travelled to Marseille to watch them play Paris Saint Germain and I was amazed with the potential I saw in him.

'When we played against them, I met him in the tunnel before the game and I told him, 'I don't have money to buy you, do you have a cousin like you who is lost in Ivory Coast?'

'That was the first time that the big guy put his arm around me. He told me, 'In Porto, you don't have money to buy me, but if you move to another club where you do have money to buy me, then I will go with you.'

'After the Champions League final with Porto at the end of that season, I moved to Chelsea and immediately began the process to sign him.

'Reflecting on our relationship, I have three moments in my mind that best characterise the man – because Didier the man is just as great as Didier the player.

'The first one was when I met him at Farnborough Airport when he was landing to sign for Chelsea. The way he hugged me, and the way he thanked me was not normal for a player towards a manager, immediately after signing for a new club. Chelsea were changing his life forever in that moment, and he knew that.

'The second moment was after we won the 2007 FA Cup at Wembley against Manchester United. The game finished and I went to the dressing room, leaving the players to enjoy the moment and to celebrate on the pitch.

'I was on the phone with my wife, when suddenly a big monster ran into the dressing room and told me that if I didn't come with the players, they wouldn't collect the cup. They would only go up there with me.

'I told him that I wanted the players to go and enjoy the moment together – that I didn't need to be there – and he said, "We are only one. You can come by your will, or I will carry you there!"

'The third moment was when I left Chelsea in 2007 and I saw the big man crying like a baby.

'So I can say that he is a phenomenal person, and I have also had the privilege to visit his country and to see what he means, not just to the people of Ivory Coast, but to so many African nations in that region.

'I know what he means as a player and as a person. That is why this combination of the player and the person is so amazing.

'Throughout my career, I have always refused to say which is my favourite player or the best person, because so many have given soul and blood to play and to fight with me, but if I have to choose one who represents all the good things you want in a player and a man, I think in this moment I would choose Didier.'
