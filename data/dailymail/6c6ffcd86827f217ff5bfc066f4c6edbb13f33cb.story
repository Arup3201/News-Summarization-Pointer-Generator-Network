John Miller, 36, 'slaughtered' his partner and eight-year-old daughter but spared his 'pure Aryan' youngest daughter

A father butchered his partner and their eight-year-old daughter in a cannabis-induced psychotic frenzy, a court heard yesterday.

John Miller, 38, spared their other daughter, aged four, because she was a ‘true Aryan with blonde hair and blue eyes’.

The family had a ‘last meal’ together at home and watched Coronation Street before Miller – a drug abuser who had smoked skunk cannabis for years – erupted in violence as teacher Sarah Laycock, 31, was putting the girls to bed.

He said he heard voices in his head and was told by ‘electrical signals’ to kill his family members, Leeds Crown Court was told.

Miss Laycock was thrown downstairs and killed by Miller in the kitchen. She was stabbed 19 times – once through her eye – with a knife before being hit four times in the face with an axe.

Miller then killed Abigail in the living room. The schoolgirl put up a ‘considerable struggle’ as her father stabbed her nine times, severing an artery in her neck.

He later slit his wrists and was found wandering around a nature reserve, beating his chest and ‘growling like an animal’.

It took a team of police officers two hours to arrest the fitness fanatic using ‘sheer brute force’. Police found four-year-old Amelia in the house in Garforth, West Yorkshire, with the family’s dog.

The youngster had been alone for more than 12 hours with the bodies of her mother and sister.

Miller, who was a member of the BNP and described as ‘overtly racist’, said he spared Amelia because of her ‘DNA’. He carried the girl upstairs after the horrific attacks, and warned her to stay in a bedroom.

Miller attacked deputy head partner Sarah in the kitchen with a knife, stabbing her 19 times in the face

A court packed with family heard Miller then attacked little Abigail with a bladed weapon. When police found the small body in the living room of the family home she was still dressed in her nightdress

In his interview Miller said he had thrown Sarah down the stairs before attacking her. After being arrested he made 'overtly racist' remarks, claiming that all people with brown eyes had 'muddied the gene pool'

Leeds Crown Court heard that plasterer Miller had picked his daughters up from school on January 13 last year, telling them they 'needed to hurry home because there is going to be a nuclear war

Miller pleaded guilty to manslaughter by 
reason of diminished responsibility and was yesterday jailed for life, 
with a minimum term of 15 years.

The court heard the plasterer was 
mentally ill at the time of the incident in January 2012 and the one-off
violent ‘psychotic episode’ was probably the result of taking cannabis,
cocaine and steroids for many years.

 'I've had no reprieve, no release for good behaviour.

'My daughter and granddaughter - brutally and violently murdered - their basic human rights removed - their right to live.

'Everything I've worked for is now gone.

'Everything I planned for has gone. The lifestyle I accepted as the norm has been shattered.'

The father-of-two later told 
psychiatrists he believed there was going  to be a nuclear war and he 
was instructed by messages from his computer to kill them.

The judge 
dismissed defence claims that he was a paranoid schizophrenic and 
decided he was fit to serve a prison sentence rather than go to 
hospital. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Coulson described the offences as
‘appalling’ and said they were ‘particularly heinous crimes’.

The 
court heard he slit his wrists and waded into a lake at Fairburn Ings 
nature reserve, but didn’t go through with the suicide attempt.

Paramedics were called to treat him but they ran away from the ambulance when he became violent. Michelle
Colborne, QC, prosecuting said that when police officers arrived Miller
was standing on a bank ‘beating his chest and grunting and growling in 
an animal’s voice’.

A ‘large number’ of officers eventually 
overpowered him. Miller initially told police his girlfriend had died in
an accident. But officers went to the house where they found Amelia at 
the top of the stairs cuddling the family’s dog Rex. She had no serious 
physical injuries.

Amelia later told her aunt that she was ‘scared’ 
of her father and asked if he would ever be released from jail. Her one 
question was ‘what was the size of the padlock on Daddy’s door?’.

The
dead teacher’s father Christopher Laycock said in a victim impact 
statement: ‘Everything I have worked for has gone, everything I have 
planned has gone. The lifestyle I accepted as the norm is shattered.’

Detective
Superintendent Lisa Griffin said outside court Miller had ‘no history 
of mental illness and no one could have predicted or prevented this 
terrible tragedy’.

She added: ‘Sarah Laycock was a loyal partner, 
loving mother and a hard-working deputy head teacher. She did nothing to
provoke her violent death and everything to love and protect her children.'
