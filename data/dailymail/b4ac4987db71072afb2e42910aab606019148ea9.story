Families may have to separate their rubbish into six bins from next year, Britain’s biggest waste firm warned yesterday.

EU rules coming into force this January dictate that councils should collect glass, paper, tin cans and plastic separately, to avoid contamination and ensure they can be properly recycled.

Veolia, which collects or sorts rubbish for a third of the population, said the regulations are likely to force councils to place more bins outside every home.

Veolia, a waste company which sorts rubbish for a third of the population, have warned that people may have to sort their rubbish into six bins after new EU recycling laws come into force next year

A spokesman said the firm is calling for ‘a nationwide policy of “no more unnecessary bins”’.

They warned: ‘From January 2015, EU rules mean households and businesses may need to separate their waste into six separate bins. Veolia thinks most of the sorting can be done post-collection and that four bins are more than enough.’

Government officials insist councils should be left to decide how to collect rubbish. They are looking closely at the wording of the revised EU Waste Framework Directive, which remains shrouded in confusion.

They claim the rules may not lead to more bins – as local authorities could be exempted if they demonstrate that adding bins is not feasible.

Officials also say waste could be collected in fewer bins and then separated by binmen on the pavement – but Veolia has dismissed this proposal as dangerous.

The company has attacked the latest rules as ‘unnecessary’ and ‘completely impractical’, adding that modern technology means most rubbish can be separated after it has been collected. 

The firm said those calling for more separate collections are ‘trying to push an environmental agenda that they don’t understand’.

A YouGov poll commissioned by Veolia suggested 69 per cent of people are not prepared to separate their rubbish into more than four bins. 

The poll found that 94 per cent of the 2,500 respondents said recycling was important – but only 12 per cent considered having six or more bins reasonable.

Richard Kirkman, Veolia’s technical director, said: ‘The public are very supportive of recycling, but we must make it easy for them.’

Firm says those asking for more collections are 'pushing an environmental agenda that they don’t understand’

‘Some other groups and consultants are trying to push an environmental agenda that they don’t understand. They are pushing for everything to be separate... this will be completely impractical for people. We are just saying let’s be sensible, it needs to be easier for people, not harder.’

The wording of the waste regulation, drawn up in 2010, is so unclear that the European Commission had to issue a separate document on how to follow the rules.

This still failed to clarify matters, and there has been much debate over whether the rules compel councils to introduce extra bins, or if different items can be placed together in single ‘co-mingled’ containers. 

Environment Minister Lord de Mauley has given guidance to councils, stating: ‘Separate collection does not of course mean that each household will need more bins. 

'For example, many areas have kerbside sort systems where materials are sorted before being loaded into the waste collection vehicle.’

However, Mr Kirkman said kerbside separation ‘is not feasible everywhere’, adding: ‘It is not very safe.’

The Local Government Association insisted councils should be left alone to decide how to deal with waste.

A spokesman said: ‘There is no one-size-fits-all solution... the types of bin which would suit a large detached house in the country would be completely unsuitable for a high-rise block of flats in inner-city London, and vice versa.’

A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘Waste collections need to be easy to understand for residents.

‘Local councils are best placed to decide how to organise collection schemes in their areas. This new regulation does not mean households require more bins.’
