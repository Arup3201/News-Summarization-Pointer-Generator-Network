The Australian mum whose 'miracle' baby survived a premature birth in the back of a Fijian taxi - only to lose her husband a month later - has vowed to give back to the hospital which helped deliver her daughter.

Jayne Wren, 40, and her husband, Ashley, 41, from Port Macquarie on the NSW mid-north coast, unexpectedly welcomed their daughter while they were holidaying in Nadi for a friend's wedding.

An online campaign was launched to help them cover the $60,000 the birth coast as their travel insurance did not cover the expenses of having a baby in Fiji or bringing the child home.

But the family's joy at bringing home a happy and healthy girl called Maddi, has now turned to despair with the death of Ashley, a teacher dubbed 'Ironman', from a suspected heart attack on Friday morning.

Now, Jayne is determined to honour her husband's memory by donated much needed equipment and essentials to the Fijian hospital that cared for her and her daughter.

'It’s Ashley’s legacy to give back to them,' Jayne told 9News.'One day, I’d love to take her back and show the nurses and doctors how she’s thrived.'Jayne began fund raising efforts last month and with the help of Melbourne organisation FijiOz has already shipped 25 cartons of donated items, including toys, blankets and clothes to Nadi Hospital.FijiOz also donated 20 hydraulic hospital beds to the hospital on behalf of the Wrens.Family and friends took to social media to pay tribute to an 'inspirational man' who was much-loved by his community.

'The tears flow and words escape us in disbelief,' one friend wrote.

'Wish I could turn back time for you,' another posted on the mother's Facebook page.

Jayne and Ashley Wren weren't expecting to be parents until July, so they did not purchase travel insurance that covered the cost of their baby being born while they were overseas for a friend's wedding last month.

Funds continue to be donated for the family and has reached more than $26,000 on mycause.com.au with some leaving condolence messages.

They include: 'a smile that is endless... You are missed Ash' and 'Mr Wren was my year 2 teacher. I think about him every time I say, "Cool bananas"'.

Ashley, who taught a year 1 class at St Columba Anglican School, been described as 'a lovely man' and 'one of the funny teachers'.

Principal Terry Muldoon said the teacher was a triathlete and successfully completed in the Port Macquarie Ironman challenge.

One friend was shocked and wrote that Ashley tragically died from a heart attack.

'You just don't expect an Ironman to die like that,' she wrote.

Jayne described her husband as 'the love of my life' in a caption on a Facebook photo.

When she spoke to Daily Mail Australia earlier this month, she described the 'horrendous' moment she began giving birth in the back of a taxi on the streets of Nadi.

'I was so fearful that our baby would die,' she said from Fiji at the time, where she is stranded until they can afford to bring their newborn home - and their baby is strong enough to travel.

'The experience of giving birth in the back of a taxi was horrendous to say the least... This being my first baby, being in a foreign country and not knowing that the labor was progressing so quickly,' Mrs Wren explained.

Recounting the terrifying moment she went into labour early, she said: 'By the time we reached the front of Nadi Hospital, her head was out and I managed to get from the back seat of the taxi to a stretcher bed, where I gave birth on all fours to my baby girl.

'She literally fell out under my dress on to the mattress of the bed... My husband had to try and catch her... It all happened so fast.'

Mrs Wren tried her hardest not to give into contractions but it was no use.

'Everything inside my head in the back of that cab said "don't push"... but when you are in labor, your body just takes over and it just knows what to do.'

Maddison Jayne Cazna Wren arrived early at 33 weeks at 1.7kg and was placed on an incubator at Nadi Hospital.

'The difficulties we are facing at the moment are that she is too small to fly weighing in today at just 1.65kg,' Jayne said.

'She is under the blue ray lights in the incubator at the moment being treated for jaundice, and we will hopefully be able to turn those blue lights off tomorrow or Tuesday.

'Then she has to have the temperature in the humidicrib turned down bit by bit to see if she can tolerate the outside air temperature by herself. This will take another few days. The great news is that she can breath by herself.'

A Facebook post on June 26 revealed that the baby was doing well and weighs at 1.98kg.

'Maddison is going from strength to strength,' Jayne wrote.

The couple had flown to Fiji last month after being granted full permission by doctors in Sydney.

They are grateful for the support they received from staff at Nadi Hospital.

'The treatment for our beautiful daughter at Nadi Hospital has been so amazing,' Jayne said.

'We are lucky enough to have been blessed with an Australian/Fijian doctor by the name of Sai Misi Misi. He is extremely knowledgeable being a pediatrician and has had a lot of experience with premature babies having worked in Australia for a number of years.

'The nursing staff have been so wonderfully loving and caring, and they are totally mesmerised by having a white baby in their care, which is something they don't get to experience very often.'

An online campaign was launched to pay the $60,000 to bring Maddi home

The family waited not only to raise enough money to bring Maddi home but also for her to be strong enough to fly.

'To bring Maddi home we need her to be well enough to fly in an open bassinette (which is Doctor Sai's preference over bringing the humidicrib on the plane with us) and to be able to cope with the cabin pressure of the plane.'

Mrs Wren's friend Angela Allison is the person in charge of setting up the fundraising page with a target of $60,000.

The amount is believed to be needed to cover Maddi's medical bills and travel costs, plus the extra accommodation and flights for the medic to travel with them.

Ms Allison told Daily Mail Australia the new parents have been overwhelmed by support from friends, family and strangers.

'Now that a few Aussie celebs have retweeted we are gaining donations from strangers,' she said.

'Initially it was just friends and family of Ash and Jay and people who read about it via the shared Facebook link. It's so exciting to watch the amount raise and to think about how much this is going to mean for them.'

Medical expenses, accommodation and flights for the baby won't be covered by travel insurance. The campaign has raised $26,000 but needs to raise $60,000
