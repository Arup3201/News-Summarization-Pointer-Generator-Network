It's a difficult, unique and presumably upsetting job.

But the overlooked and controversial work of forensics who use the skulls of murder victims who have been obliterated or decomposed to form facial sculptures has been captured as part of a new photo exhibit.

The sculptures are used to identify the victims and for investigators to get to the bottom of what happened to them.

New York photographer Arne Svenson spent four years traveling the United States and Mexico to capture the images.

Because forensics build the reconstruction around the actual skull, they have to be deconstructed after investigators photograph them, so the sculptures themselves are rare.

Creepy: A New York photographer has captured the strange art of facial reconstruction

Eerie: The practice is the most controversial strand of forensic anthropology

Subjective: Many question the effectiveness of facial reconstruction 

Identification: The new exhibit is called Unspeaking Likeness

Murder victims: Investigators use the sculptures to identify people who have been obliterated or decomposed

Strange: Photographer Arne Svenson spent four years capturing the photos

Rare: Still-existing sculptures are few and far between

Empathy: Svenson says his goal is to humanize these heads

Svenson hopes the viewer relates to the horrible fate that resulted in their appearance in these pictures

The practice is difficult, time-consuming and artful

Despite the controversy associated with it, facial reconstruction helps investigators solve crimes

The exhibit is called Unspeaking Likeness.

Facial reconstruction is controversial because it is not legally recognized as a technique for positive identification, so it is not admissible as expert testimony.

It also very subjective, with many disputing the effectiveness of the technique.

Svenson told Feature Shoot that his goal is to humanize these heads so that the viewer relates them to the horrible fate that resulted in their appearance in these pictures. 

While some of the sculptures appear antinque, the method is still widely used

Forensics deconstruct the sculptures after they have been photographed, making them rare

Facial reconstruction is a technique that is still actively taught and used

The sculptures are photographed and posters are printed to identify the victims

There are many other ways to identify bodies, so facial reconstruction is something of a last resort

Facial reconstruction is not legally recognized as a technique for positive identification

The sculptures are not admissible as expert testimony

Eerie: Arne Svenson is a self-taught photographer

The sculptures are used to identify the victims and for investigators to get to the bottom of what happened to them
