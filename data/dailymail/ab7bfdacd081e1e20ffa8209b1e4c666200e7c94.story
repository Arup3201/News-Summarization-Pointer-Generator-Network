In the event of his death, the astronomer was clear about what he wanted.

He would not have a funeral, but a party – ‘Quite a show. Plenty of drink.’

And yesterday, after Sir Patrick Moore died peacefully at his home, his family and friends vowed to do just that.

The monocle-wearing ‘godfather of astronomy’ passed away aged 89, at his thatched cottage in Selsey, West Sussex, after he contracted an infection.

After a short stay in hospital, it was determined that no further treatment would benefit him, and he died ‘in the company of close friends and carers and his cat Ptolemy’.

Sir Patrick had presented the BBC programme The Sky At Night for 55 years, making him the longest-running host of the same TV show.

The final programme was broadcast just last Monday and he only missed one episode, during a nearly lethal bout of food poisoning in 2004.

In recent years, he had to present the show from his home after he became wheelchair-bound.

Friends and family said he had been an ‘inspiration to generations of astronomers’ and promised a ‘farewell ceremony’ in March, to mark what would have been his 90th birthday.

Sir Patrick wrote dozens of books on astronomy – and at least one on his love for cats – and his research was used by the US and the Russians in their space programmes.

Queen guitarist and astrophysicist Brian May led the tributes to his ‘dear friend’. He said: ‘Patrick is irreplaceable. There will never be another Patrick Moore. But we were lucky enough to get one.’

Dozens of celebrities paid tribute to the star on Twitter. Author Terry Pratchett wrote: ‘Sir, you’ll be sadly missed. A legend.’

Sir Patrick died at home with his cat Ptolemy.

The word Ptolemy is a masculine Greek name, derived from the Greek word polemeios, which means 'aggressive or warlike'.

The world famous Ptolemy was a Greek geographer, mathematician, astronomer and astrologer.

Although his original Greek name is Claudius Ptolemaeus, in English he is simply referred to as Ptolemy.

Professor Brian Cox, a particle physicist and BBC presenter, said Sir Patrick had left ‘a wonderful legacy’, while comedian and presenter Sue Perkins said simply: ‘You taught me to look up.’

Impressionist Jon Culshaw tweeted: ‘Terribly, terribly sad to hear of the passing of Sir Patrick Moore, our godfather of astronomy, he captured its fascination for all of us.’

Hundreds of fans also expressed their sadness, with one tweeting: ‘One more star up there tonight.’

Born in Middlesex in 1923, he became interested in astronomy when he read The Story Of The Solar System at six years old and, aged 11, he became the youngest member of the British Astronomical Association.

He served with the RAF during the Second World War, but his fiancée Lorna, 20, a nurse, was killed in an air raid in 1943. He later said his ‘whole life ended that day’ and he never married.

In 1957, he was invited to present a new BBC show, The Sky At Night – a programme which would make him a household name.

Extraordinarily, he never gained any formal qualifications, but his ability to describe complex phenomena such as the black hole in an exciting and simple way endeared him to generations.

He was knighted in 2001 ‘for services to the popularisation of science and to broadcasting’.

Sir Patrick 'inspired every British astronomer, amateur and professional, for half a century'

Tributes poured in immediately for eccentric stargazer Sir Patrick Moore as news of his death broke.

Queen guitarist Brian May, who holds a PhD in astrophysics, led the chorus of praise, saying the world had 'lost a priceless treasure that can never be replaced' and he had lost a 'dear friend and kind of father figure'.

May said in a statement: 'Patrick was the last of a lost generation, a true gentleman, the most generous in nature that I ever knew, and an inspiration to thousands in his personal life, and to millions through his 50 years of unique broadcasting.

'It's no exaggeration to say that Patrick, in his tireless and ebullient communication of the magic of astronomy, inspired every British astronomer, amateur and professional, for half a century.

'Patrick will be mourned by the many to whom he was a caring uncle, and by all who loved the delightful wit and clarity of his writings, or enjoyed his fearlessly eccentric persona in public life,' he added.

'Patrick is irreplaceable. There will never be another Patrick Moore. But we were lucky enough to get one.'

Professor Brian Cox, who presents a number of science programmes for the BBC, tweeted: 'Very sad news about Sir Patrick. Helped inspire my love of astronomy. I will miss him!'

Former BBC science correspondent and fellow astronomer Dr David Whitehouse told Sky News that Sir Patrick had 'loved astronomy more than he loved himself'.

'He was passionate, he was dedicated and had an unselfish love of astronomy and he passed that on to everybody who knew him and he came across.

'He was a difficult person personally to deal with on many occasions, he was sometimes awkward, truculent, stubborn but that was Patrick, that was part of his remarkable personality which so many people came to enjoy and love.

'I think many people realised he was a unique person.

'He was not a professionally trained astronomer and yet did professional quality work, particularly when it came to mapping the Moon in the 1950s - I think every astronomer in the world owes something to Patrick Moore.'

Space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock said she had got her first inspiration to look at the night sky from Sir Patrick.

She told BBC News: 'He was broadcasting before we actually went into space and he saw a change in our understanding of the universe, and he took us all the way through that, right up until today.'

'What he did was something very straightforward, he would tell us what to look for and where to look for it and for budding astronomers everywhere that is what we need, that information,' she added.

'But he would tell us more, he would go into depth, he would take us on a journey through space and we can't ask for better than that really.'

Dr Marek Kukula, the Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said Sir Patrick had been a 'very charming and hospitable man'.
