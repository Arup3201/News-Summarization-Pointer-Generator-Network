The 'Manhattan Madam' admitted Tuesday to running a high-end prostitution service from her New York City apartment.

Anna Gristina, 44, pleaded guilty in Manhattan Criminal Court to a single count of promoting prostitution.

The sole charge against her stemmed from a tryst she allegedly arranged between two prostitutes and an 
undercover police officer, who was posing as a client, in July 2011.

Copping a plea: Anna Gristina, pictured leaving court on Tuesday, has pleaded guilty to running a high-end prostitution service from her New York City apartment

She took the deal in exchange for a promised sentence of time already served, DNAinfo reported, meaning she won't be going back to jail as she was in Rikers Island for four months earlier this year.

Gristina will be ordered to serve five months probation when she is sentenced on November 20. The judge warned the Scottish-born mother of four that she could also be deported.

The punishment is much more lenient than the potential outcome of a trial; she could have faced seven 
years behind bars if she had been found guilty at a trial scheduled for next month.

She appeared in court at 4
p.m. on Tuesday with her husband, two sons and daughter by her side.

Gristina, also known as the 'Soccer Mom Madam', had denied before she went to court that there would be any such plea deal.

'Yes, I’m going to court today,' she told the New York Daily News. 'I’m going to listen to the options. A trial is still a strong option. There will be no plea today.'

But friends told the New York Post that 
Gristina had been considering a plea deal in recent weeks, as 
prosecutors pushed her to reveal the name of one man, whom she refuses 
to identify.

'The only reason I’d take a plea is 
because I don’t want to turn on a friend,' she said. 'So that nobody 
else gets hurt, no other families get destroyed. I would do it for my 
family and friends.'

She added on Dr. Phil earlier this month: 'I have a deep sense of loyalty and I'm Scottish. It was the way I was raised. Your word is everything. I'm not going to hurt someone with a family.

'I'm not going to put the nail in the coffin of someone who is very dear to me.'

She was arrested after a five-year corruption investigation, which allegedly unearthed Gristina bragging that she had connections in law enforcement
who were protecting her.

Gristina, who is originally from 
Edinburgh in Scotland, has denied she was running a prostitution ring 
and instead claimed that she was simply running a high-class dating 
service.

Speaking out: Appearing on Dr. Phil earlier this month, Gristina said she would never reveal the names of her supposed clients. She has maintained she was providing a matchmaking service

But prosecutors alleged she made 
$15million over ten years for arranging prostitutes - including underage
girls - for wealthy clients.

She was arrested on February 22 and was held at Rikers Island on a hefty $2 million bail until her lawyers managed to argue it down.

Tuesday's appearance was her second since she was released from jail in June after posting $250,000 bail. In August her lawyer's request to drop the charge against her was denied.

Alleged co-madam Jaynie Mae Baker and accused hookers Katherine DeVries and Mhariangela Bottone have already agreed to plea deals and have stayed out of jail.
