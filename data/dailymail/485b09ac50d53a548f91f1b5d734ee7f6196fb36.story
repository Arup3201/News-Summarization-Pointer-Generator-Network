A furry critter has been spotted with wild white hair - and a striking resemblance to Albert Einstein.

The tiny caterpillar was found by Hope Martin, 45, who noticed the bug on the trunk of a walnut tree in her garden in Columbia in Missouri, U.S.

She immediately called over her daughter Jessie who couldn't stop laughing at the bug's fuzzy hairdo, which sprouts out uncontrollably.

With its shock of white hair it resembles scientific genius Albert Einstein

Famed physicist Albert Einstein, who was almost as well-known for for his shock of white hair as his incredible brain

They took photos of the bizarre creature and after making them bigger on her computer Hope noticed the insect's uncanny likeliness to the the German-born physicist, who was famous for developing the general theory of relativity and forever changing our understanding of the universe.

When she researched her finding she discovered the caterpillar was of the Laugher Moth species , found in parts of North America except south-western states.

She said: 'I was amazed at how fuzzy it was and just how much it looked like Albert Einstein too. My daughter and I observed him for quite a while - it was an active little critter.

'The first time put the two side by side 
it was funny but an amazing likeness. It has the hair like Einstein but 
with its distinct markings it makes it look like the famous picture of 
Einstein with his tongue stuck out.'

The tiny caterpillar was found by Hope Martin, 45, who noticed it on the trunk of a tree in her garden in Columbia in Missouri. Albert Einstein developed the general theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics

He said: 'I've always enjoyed looking and learning about what is living around me. Insects are pretty easy too as you don't have to go far to find many.

'We're fortunate to have woods behind our house so we don't have to go further than the garden.

'There always seems to be some kind of insect in a keeper in the house, especially caterpillars. Right now we have two Imperial Moth caterpillars munching away on maple leaves which we have raised from eggs.'

In 1921 Einstein won the Nobel Prize for physics and was so famous that in the period before World War II he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain the theory of relativity.

His ingenious way of handling it was to apologise and explain that he just happened to look like the great man. He died in Princeton, New Jersey in 1955 at the age of 76.
