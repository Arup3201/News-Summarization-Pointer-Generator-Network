Travis, pictured, has denied two charges of indecent assault and a further allegation of sexual assault 

Former BBC star Dave Lee Travis was an ‘opportunist’ who acted as if he had the ‘perfect right’ to grope young women, jurors in his retrial were told yesterday.

Travis, 69, who faces three charges, inappropriately touched women who were ‘many years’ younger than him over a period of more than 20 years, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The former Radio 1 DJ and Top of the Pops presenter faces a retrial on two counts – one of indecent assault of a woman between November 1, 1990, and January 31, 1991, and another of sexual assault on a different woman between June 1, 2008, and November 30, 2008 – on which a jury was unable to reach verdicts at a trial earlier this year.

Charged under his real name of David Griffin, he has also pleaded not guilty to a count of indecent assault alleged to have taken place on January 17, 1995.

Opening the prosecution case, Miranda Moore QC told the jury of six men and six women that a TV expose on Jimmy Savile in 2012 had prompted a number of women to come forward to Operation Yewtree – the investigation set up in the wake of the Savile scandal – about Travis.

She said the allegations spanned 1985 to 2008 and were alleged to have taken place when Travis was working as a DJ or entertainer, such as starring in a pantomime, or as a guest celebrity, or in his own home while he was being interviewed.

Miss Moore said the jury would hear from three women to whom the three charges relate, but also two other women who would describe similar alleged incidents. She said: ‘We say … he has a propensity towards laying his hands in a sexual manner on young women who are alone with him or in vulnerable positions. He is an opportunist.’ 

Southwark Crown Court heard that Travis offered to take his alleged victim's photograph at his home 

Miss Moore said the women were embarrassed and shocked by the alleged assaults and, while they had not told police, all had confided in other people at the time.

She said the first charge related to a woman who was working on a production of Aladdin in which Travis was starring.

The woman claimed that the DJ assaulted her while they were in his dressing room, holding the door closed as he put his hand inside her trousers. She managed to prise open the door to the corridor – where comedy stars the Chuckle Brothers were standing – and escaped, later telling co-workers. The second charge relates to an alleged assault on a young woman working on the Mrs Merton Show.

The court heard today that the trial involves five separate incidents involving similar types of behaviour

In a third count, Travis is alleged to have groped a female journalist when she went to his home to interview him. 

She later told her flatmates and her mother but did not take it any further because she did not want to jeopardise her career, Miss Moore said.

The prosecutor also outlined claims from two other women – to which charges are not related.

One woman claimed she was assaulted by Travis as she served him drinks at a venue on the Isle of Man, when he pinned her against a wall and put one hand on her chest and one between her legs. 

A journalist, who is Travis' third alleged victim told the court that he groped her at his home, pictured, in 2008

Another female journalist claims that Travis assaulted her while she was at his house to interview him.

Travis, who was arrested in October 2012, denies all of the incidents.

Miss Moore said: ‘He has suggested that possibly the women have come forward motivated by greed or compensation or possibly fame.

‘Essentially his defence is, this never happened, it is made up, fabricated, lies, whatever expression you want to use, that’s what he says.’

The trial continues.

The jury was told that one of the alleged assaults was interrupted by the Chuckle Brothers, pictured 

Southwark Crown Court heard that the alleged victim's mother advised her not to tell her employers
