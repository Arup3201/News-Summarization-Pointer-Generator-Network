Prisoners caught using Facebook on smuggled mobile phones will be stripped of their perks or have time added to their sentence, it emerged tonight.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered ‘serious disciplinary consequences’ for any convict who posts pictures of themselves on social networking sites.

It follows revelations by the Mail that hundreds of prisoners - including notorious killers - are using Facebook to taunt their victims from behind bars.

In the last two years nearly 350 inmates have been discovered posting on the social networking site while locked up.

Prisoners are banned from accessing the internet but get online using mobile phones smuggled into their cells. 

Mr Grayling said: ‘Prison is not meant to be a comfortable place, full of perks and undeserved privileges.

‘Those offenders who smuggle mobile phones into prisons and take pictures of themselves and their fellow inmates purporting to be having an easy time should take heed – they will face serious disciplinary consequences.’

The most likely punishments are to remove the privileges enjoyed by inmates, such as having a television inside their cell.

Prisons also have powers to add extra days to the length of time an inmate must serve.

In a separate move, it emerged ministers are planning to remove Sky TV from jails.

Currently, inmates serving time in privately-run institutions have access to the perk.

Insiders say it is likely to be banned as part of a wide-ranging review of privileges being conducted by the Prisons Minister, Jeremy Wright.

The Mail has highlighted a string of cases of criminals using Facebook from behind bars.

They include Jade Braithwaite, who was jailed for life for the murder of Ben Kinsella.

The 22-year-old wrote 'I'm down but not out' and said he wanted to 'delete people'.

He was jailed for life following the knife attack in London in June 2008.

The postings were read by Ben's family who said they were 'appalled' and disgusted and the messages were an 'insult to Ben's memory'.

The killer Ryan Herbert, who murdered 20-year-old Sophie Lancaster in 2007, was found to have sent more than 100 messages using the site.

He sent flirtatious messages to female friends and also posted pictures of himself posing with other inmates in the prison gym.

In another case, a teenage boy who killed a shopkeeper posted a series of pictures on Facebook showing him making 'gangster salutes'.

Liam Ryan, 19, was jailed for life for the murder of Birmingham shopkeeper and Suppiah Tharmaseelan.

He was part of a gang which attacked the father of four after he fought back when they tried to steal alcohol.

The pictures, apparently taken from inside his Young Offenders' Institution cell, show Ryan making an obscene gesture at the camera.

They also show the piles of junk food in his cell and his personal television set and games console.

And eight men posted a mock holiday snap of themselves posing shirtless at HMP Haverigg in Cumbria.

The inmates even likened their prison sentences to a holiday in Spain.

Crackdown: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling says any convict caught posting pictures of themselves on social networking sites faces 'serious disciplinary consequences'.

Ministry of Justice figures released after a Freedom of Information request show 199 Facebook profiles were taken down between July 2010 and June last year.

Another 143 profiles were removed between July 2009 and June 2010. All were removed by Facebook following an investigation by prison officials.

The crackdown emerged in a wide-ranging speech by Mr Grayling, who promised a ‘rehabilitation revolution’ inside Britain’s jails.

He announced education in young offenders' institutions will be dramatically improved to stop the ‘travesty’ of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money being spent on detention for 'little gain'.

Mr Grayling said some teenagers were costing up to £200,000 a year to look after - five times the bill of sending them to a top public school like Eton - but most reoffended.

He also confirmed plans to recruit ex-offenders to act as mentors to newly-released criminals.
