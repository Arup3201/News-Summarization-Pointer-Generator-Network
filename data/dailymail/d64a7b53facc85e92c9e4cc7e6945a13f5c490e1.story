Priced from £12, the collection describes itself as 'elegantly styled with lace detail and Dita's signature tassel trims.'

Each piece is made from a fine woven satin that claims to 'enhance elegance and fit.'

Speaking about the range, Dita said: 'I love contrasting satin and lace, and I really wanted an elegant, smooth bra that also creates voluptuous cleavage.

'The wide-set straps leave the front of the chest very bare, which is very, very sexy.'

The
 41-year-old dancer has spent the last two weeks performing at Revolution in Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida as part of her Burlesque: Strip Strip Hooray! 
southern US tour.
