Newcastle legend Alan Shearer fears his former side could be relegated as they don't look like scoring or keeping clean sheets.

Alan Pardew's men remain rooted to the bottom of the Premier League after picking up just two points from their opening four games, with many Toon fans calling for the manager's head during the 4-0 defeat at Southampton.

And Shearer doesn't see things changing drastically and says the pressure is really on Newcastle now.

Alan Shearer has major concerns over his former side Newcastle this season

Newcastle are lacking the killer instinct they had when Shearer was up front

In his column for The Sun he said: 'Newcastle do not look like scoring and do not look like keeping clean sheets.

'That's a recipe for relegation in anyone's book - and boss Alan Pardew is now under massive pressure. 

'The display against Southampton was just terrible from start to finish.' 

While Toon owner Mike Ashley has given Pardew a vote of confidence following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at Southampton, time is seemingly running out for the 53-year-old, with Shearer stressing that the pressure will continue to build until Newcastle finally turn the corner.

He added: 'Newcastle just simply have to win now. The longer you go without a win, the harder it is to get one. The pressure is well and truly on.'
