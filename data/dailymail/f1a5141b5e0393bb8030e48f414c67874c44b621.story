The decision to use Prince William as the spearhead for England’s 2018 World Cup bid was under scrutiny last night after a controversial inquiry ruled that the FA used corrupt tactics.

The England bid was condemned as ‘improper’ yesterday by a FIFA ethics probe, which cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing.

The Prince was left ‘bitterly disappointed’ in 2010 when he – along with David Beckham and David Cameron – were ‘stitched up’ in the secret ballot, winning only two of a possible 22 votes, despite having privately secured the pledges of at least five FIFA delegates.

The trio felt ‘lied to’, according to one England bid member who said it was ‘embarrassing that William and the Prime Minister have lent their good names’ to the project.

William was reported to have objected to having to fawn to FIFA officials who had assembled in Zurich to decide which countries should host the World Cup finals of 2018 and 2022.

He was quoted as having said: ‘I don’t see why we have to suck up to these people.’

The Premier later shed light on the extent to which William pushed to secure the votes of delegates from FIFA, football’s governing body.

Mr Cameron told how he had met the prince coming out of one meeting: ‘He said it had gone really, really well. I said, “Gosh, how did you do it? What did you offer him, an invitation to the royal wedding?” He said, “Prime Minister, I went so far I think I offered to marry him.”’

William was keeping a dignified silence yesterday. But Football Association chairman Greg Dyke described the FIFA claims as ‘a joke’. 

The report by FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was scathing about England’s conduct, including severely reprimanding it for a £35,000 sponsorship of a gala dinner for the then FIFA vice-president Jack Warner in his native Trinidad

It said that the now disgraced Warner had abused his power to exact personal benefits and England ‘showed willingness, time and again, to meet such expectation, thereby damaging the image of FIFA and the bidding process’.

Russia, which won the 2018 bid, and Qatar, selected as 2022 hosts, were handed a clean bill of health despite suspicions they may have bribed their way to success.

Yet just hours after publishing its findings yesterday, FIFA – long dogged by claims of corruption – was rocked when Eckert’s report was disowned by the chief investigator, US lawyer Michael Garcia.

Eckert’s 42-page report was a summary of a 430-page report – not published – by Garcia who spent nearly two years investigating the corruption claims on behalf of Fifa.

Garcia said the summary contained ‘numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations’.

An FA spokesman said: ‘We strongly refute any suggestions of impropriety by those involved in the England bid.’
