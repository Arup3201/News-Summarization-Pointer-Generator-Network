Russia has urged the world's other major emerging economies to join forces to counter Western clout.

President Vladimir Putin, a frequently critic of Europe and the U.S., said the BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - should broaden their role and get more involved in geopolitics.

His comments come as China's new communist leader sent a defiant signal to the U.S. and Europe today as he arrived in Russia with his first lady on 
his first foreign trip as president.

The visit by Xi Jinping 
underlines the importance of Beijing's growing alliance with Moscow and
will do little to thaw the two countries' difficult relationships with 
the West.

Russia is the
world's largest energy producer and China is it biggest consumer, and 
together the two nations are looking to bolster a financial and geopolitical counter weight to Washington.

Mr Putin was speaking before a summit next week of the group, which also includes Brazil, India and South Africa. It comes amid creasing fears of growing Russian influence in Europe through its dealings with bankrupt Cyprus.

He told news agency Itar-Tass that the BRICS members were working on joint declarations on the conflicts in Syria and Afghanistan, Iran's nuclear programme, the situation in the Middle East and other issues.

'We invite our partners to gradually transform BRICS from a dialogue forum that coordinates approaches to a limited number of issues into a full-scale strategic cooperation mechanism that will allow us to look for solutions to key issues of global politics together,' Putin said according to a Kremlin transcript of the interview.

BRICS leaders are expected to use the March 26-27 meeting in Durban, South Africa to endorse plans to create a joint foreign exchange reserves pool and an infrastructure bank, senior emerging market officials said on Thursday.

Putin, who wants more for foreign investment to bolster Russia's economy, said Russia plans to announce the creation of a BRICS Business Council to promote trade and investment within the group and help launch multilateral business

Today's visit by Xi Jinping is also set against a backdrop of the United States' 'Asia pivot' strategy of additional focus on the region in areas such as trade, investment and military presence and alliances, which worries Beijing.

Mr Xi will meet Mr Putin later and they could preside over deals that would make Beijing Russia's top customer for oil - although they are not expected to sign a long-sought agreement on supplies of pipeline gas to China.

Just before Mr Xi's arrival with first lady Peng Liyuan, a $2 billion deal (£1.3bn) was announced by Russian and Chinese companies to develop coal resources in eastern Siberia, which underlined the countries' intentions.

Mr Putin has said he wants to 'catch the Chinese wind in our economic sail' and that desire will grow stronger if China overtakes the U.S. as the world's largest economy during Mr Xi's 10-year term.

Perhaps symbolically, Mr Xi's visit overshadowed a meeting Russian government leaders and the European Union's Commission also taking place in Moscow.

Friendship: Mr Xi, 59, has fondly recalled how he read Russian literature in his younger days

The two leaders, less than a year apart in age, echoed one another in interviews before the visit, each saying the Chinese leader's choice of Moscow as his first destination was evidence of the 'strategic partnership' between the nations.

A smiling Mr Xi, 59, recalled that he read Russian literature in his younger days. Mr Putin, 60, said Russian-Chinese relations were at 'the best in their centuries-long history'.

The two U.N. Security Council members' solidarity on important global issues has strengthened in recent years.

They have joined forces three times to block Western-backed measures on the conflict in Syria despite talk of grumbling in Beijing, and Russia has followed China's lead on North Korea - two issues likely to come up in Friday's talks.

They have negotiated alongside the West on Iran's nuclear programme, but have watered down past sanctions in the Security Council and opposed new punitive measures as counterproductive.

Russia has added to Japan's woes over territorial disputes with Beijing by playing up its control of an archipelago claimed by Tokyo.

Beijing and Moscow have also stood side-by-side in rejecting Western criticism of their record on human rights.

But the lockstep movement on the global stage has not translated into easy agreement on bilateral energy deals, underlining the limits that persist in the relationship.

A huge business complex on the edge of Moscow, decorated with Chinese paintings and red silk armchairs, is the kind of enterprise Mr Xi wants to nurture in Russia.

A jumble of Chinese and Russian firms, a 400-room hotel and conference venues sprawl over the 77 square mile, $350 million (£2.3m) Greenwood complex.

It was built by a Beijing-controlled consortium with materials shipped from China. Mr Xi's presidency is seen as a chance to put new impetus into such projects and into ties with Russia as a whole.

Mr Putin said this week that bilateral trade had more than doubled in five years and reached $87.5 billion (£58m) in 2012 - although it is about five times smaller than Russia's with the European Union, and far smaller than China's trade with the U.S.

But the rising influence of China, with its proximity to Russia's sparsely populated eastern parts and nearly 10 times more people, has also given rise in Russia to worries China may one day challenge Moscow's influence on its own territory.

Russia has created a separate ministry to channel resources to its far east, which complains of neglect and underfunding more than 20 years after the Soviet Union collapsed.

Defence analysts say Russian efforts to allocate military resources, including air defences and nuclear submarines, to its eastern coast is an effort to counter China's rising military might - even as Russia sells weapons to its neighbour.

Like their populations, their economies are uneven. China's gross domestic product grew 7.8 per cent last year, while Russia's growth was about 3.5 per cent and was close to stagnating in February, with 0.1 per cent year-on-year growth.

Mr Xi and Mr Putin are expected to attend a summit next week of the BRICS group of emerging market economies, another vehicle for their efforts to counter Western clout, and the Chinese leader will visit African nations Beijing is courting.
