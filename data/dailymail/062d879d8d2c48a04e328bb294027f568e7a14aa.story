It's not every day that James Rodriguez is present at Craven Cottage and on Friday night the quaint stadium on the bank of the River Thames was absolutely rocking.

Cheering every moment the Colombia captain touched the ball, the man could do no wrong in front of the electrified spectators in the stands at the home of Fulham Football Club.

Having single-handedly dominated the majority of the match the Real Madrid man was the star of the show for his adoring fans.

And when Teofilo Gutierrez headed in Edwin Cardona's 87th minute cross, the crowd erupted into a manic frenzy. 

As soon as referee Szymon Marciniak put the whistle to his lips to blow for full time, the former Monaco midfielder was mobbed by fans all wanting to get up close with their favourite superstar. 

Not to be forgotten, injured Manchester United and Colombia striker Radamel Falcao was also in the stands, but he was able to remain a little more composed than those around him.
