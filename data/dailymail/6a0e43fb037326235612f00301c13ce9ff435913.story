Andy Murray knew things had changed a week ago when he walked out on Centre Court to the kind of pop star reception not witnessed since the exceptional days of the London 2012 tennis event.

If his first week was marked by a series of sublime displays against relatively unthreatening opposition, it was also notable for an unreserved adulation of the defending champion that has taken years to build.

Members of One Direction, present last week and expected again here (gasp), might have known the feeling Murray got when he came out to tackle his first opponent, David Goffin.

Doubtless on Monday the greeting will be similar, but the challenge will be very different to that offered by the lightweight, diminutive Belgian. The 27 year-old Scot could feel  positively Lilliputian as he walks out alongside South Africa’s Kevin Anderson.

The 6ft 8in giant from Johannesburg is the fourth of seven men whom Murray will have to beat between now and next Sunday to successfully defend his title.

With the way he has played so far, it is easy to forget that last year’s winner has not reached any final since — the process of returning to his best proving lengthy after back surgery and a change of coach.

For now, the temptation has to be resisted of thinking ahead to potentially sumptuous matches later in the week, a possible quarter-final against the coming man Grigor Dimitrov and a semi that would be a repeat of the 2013 final against Novak Djokovic.

Anderson is more dangerous than anyone Murray has met in the  previous rounds, even if he looks like he might have got lost on his way to the nearest basketball court.

He shares something with Murray in that he first got into the game via playing swingball. He graduated to the local junior circuit, where one of his rivals was the prodigiously talented AB de Villiers, now one of the world’s finest cricketers.

Anderson left South Africa for three years on the American  college circuit playing for Illinois State, where he was initially known as someone who only pushed the ball gently around and failed to harness his enormous levers.

At 28 that has all changed and he is one of the most ferocious ball strikers on the tour, aside from  having the hefty serve you would expect. If a rally lasts more than half-a-dozen shots, he is likely to pull the trigger and try to end it with a death-or-glory winner.

When Murray was in the final last year, the genial giant found himself rooting for the home player and accepts that he has to play the  villain when the match starts at around 3pm on Monday.

‘You couldn’t help but hope for Andy last year,’ he admitted. ‘I really enjoy watching Novak play but at this tournament, given the history, Andy had a lot of support, even from other players.

‘Maybe I’ll be the bad guy but I need to try to block that out. Andy has won it now, so I guess there’s no need for him to go on and win two in a row!

‘It will be amazing just to play on Centre Court, not many people in this sport do it. It will be a great experience but I am there to win the match.’

Anderson is a good athlete, to  the point where he was once a promising 800 metres runner.

But while he moves well for  someone of his size, he can expect to be dragged all over the court in rallies by Murray, a master manipulator of the tennis ball.

Murray’s uncommon eye picks up a big serve early and is a major  factor in why he has compiled such a good record against tall players, whom he teases by keeping the ball sliced low. Anderson’s serve is a weapon, although just below the most devastating in the game.

He has delivered 63 aces in three matches so far but been broken six times in 56 service games — and none of his opponents returns as well as Murray. If he keeps his  composure as well as he has so far, Murray should come through.

He has enjoyed the experience of being defending champion and was cheerful on Sunday amid the eerie calm of Wimbledon on its traditional rest day. ‘I think after  winning it last year, the pressure of wanting to win definitely was finally released,’ said Murray. ‘Obviously I’m still feeling the pressure and the nerves but this year they are completely different. I like having the nerves and I’m able to use them positively.’

This week is also a huge test for his new coach Amelie Mauresmo, although their relationship has clearly worked well to date.

‘It’s great having Amelie around. She’s a very calm person but also incredibly supportive, so naturally that helps me,’ said Murray.

‘She’s also a great listener and if I have any concerns she’ll listen to them and then we’ll work through them in practice.

‘She has been over to the house a few times but she’s not living with us. It’s quite important to give each other space, particularly during the Grand Slams as you can spend a lot of time together.’

Defeat on Monday would end things abruptly for this fortnight, although it sounds like Murray’s bold appointment of the Frenchwoman is destined to run further.
