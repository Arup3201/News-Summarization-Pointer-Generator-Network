A millionaire property developer who lost a planning battle over two £15,000 lion-topped gate posts has broken his collarbone as he attempted to remove them.

Officials ruled that Edward Packer, 73, must remove the 12ft high Bath stone pillars outside his seven-bedroom home in the upmarket Sneyd Park area of Bristol - saying they were 'out of keeping' with the local area.

Despite vowing to fight the 'unelected officials' who said they must be removed, Mr Packer lost his battle and was forced to take them down.

Row: Mr Packer, standing in front of the now empty plinths outside his Bristol home, was ordered to remove the posts by council officers who said they were 'out of keeping' with the area - the upmarket Sneyd Park

But as he dismantled the elaborate entrance a stone dislodged, causing him to fall and break his collarbone.

Today, the property magnate said: 'I wish I had never built the pillars in the first place.

'But I am keeping them right here in my garden where they look beautiful.

'I managed to dislodge one of the stones with the jack hammer and I just went down with it.

'I still don’t know why anybody would complain about the pillars in the first place.

'There is nothing offensive about them. I can’t see why this sort of thing is so difficult for people and the council. It seems like everything is a trial with them.

Former glory: The posts, installed by Mr Packer in Christmas last year, were 12ft tall and made from Bath stone

'The doctors said I will be out for six weeks, but I can’t wait to get back to work. I don’t think I’ll ever retire.'

Mr Packer moved into the expansive Cooks Folly, which was built in the 1840s, around 15 years ago.

He erected the pillars outside his ten-acre plot just before Christmas.

However, a few months after installing the pillars he received a letter from the council stating they were 'out of keeping' with the listed 1860s house and had 'no substantial public benefit'.

But Mr Packer disputed the council’s claim and said the posts were an asset, which enhanced the road.

At the time, Mr Packer said: 'An Englishman's home is supposed to be his castle.

Adamant: Mr Packer said the posts were an added asset to his listed 1860s, seven-bedroom property and none of his neighbours objected to them

'Well, I live in a castle but it doesn't feel that way after seeing these officials come up here and tell me to take my pillars down.

'I see the posts as an asset, which enhances the folly. I haven't met one person who doesn't like them.'

Mr Packer instructed his lawyers to challenge the enforcement notice, a process he predicted would cost him £3,000.

He added: 'I didn't realise we needed planning permission for the pillars.

'I found out afterwards that anything above 3ft needed permission so I applied for retrospective planning and they wouldn't have it.

'They won't even let me speak to a conservation officer. The council is so draconian, trees have more rights than people here.

'It is not like it is a block of flats I've just built, they are pillars at the front of a home in a quiet cul-de-sac. What harm will they do? Not one person has complained to me.

'I've lived at the home for 15 years and we've spent thousands restoring it.

'The councillors are a waste of time, they just rubber stamp what unelected planners say. The planners and politicians in Bristol are too busy fighting each other to help the people.'

After a lengthy appeal process Mr Packer was finally given a month to remove the controversial pillars.
