It's not just Victoria Beckham, pictured, who can't resist splashing out on a new handbag - 50 per cent of women in the UK bought a new bag last year

It’s not just the Victoria Beckhams and Paris Hiltons of this world who can’t resist splashing out on a new handbag.

More than half of British women have admitted to buying at least one new handbag last year, according to new research.

And young women as well their mature counterparts both prioritise purchasing the accessory over every day essentials such as underwear.

The report by consumer analysts Mintel shows that a total of 21 per cent of women say they have bought a handbag just to accompany a new outfit from the same store.

And 16 per cent of women who have bought handbags in the last twelve months admit to having bought on impulse.

When it comes to buying fashion accessories, including handbags, it seems most women still cannot resist a bargain, with over half (59 per cent) of them motivated by sales or discounts.

And while low price remains key for many consumers, women aged 25-34 place the least importance on price, with just 47 per cent buying on sales or special offer compared to 56 per cent of 16-24s and 56 per cent of 35-44s.

Tamara Sender, senior fashion analyst at Mintel, said: ‘While consumers have become considerably more prudent with their money as a result of the recession, women have continued to spend on fashion items, with handbags the main driver of sales.’

‘The fact that younger women place more importance on handbags than on everyday essentials such as underwear is good news for the fashion industry - because as this fashion conscious generation grow up, they will continue to invest more as their earnings increase.

More than a third of women aged between 16 to 24 (38 per cent) said they spend their extra money on handbags while 36 per cent bought underwear.

And it is not just young women willing to splash out on the perfect accessories, those aged between aged 45 and 54 also see handbags as one of the most desirable fashion accessories, prioritising handbags (29 per cent) over underwear (26 per cent).

Miss Sender added: ‘Overall, handbags account for the largest share of the fashion accessories market and have seen the strongest sales in the sector, up 11 per cent between 2012 and 2013, to top £1.2 billion.

Overall, the fashion accessories market grew by 4.7 per cent in 2013 to reach £2.5 billion.’

And it is not just women with a love of handbags in the UK, nearly one in 10 (8 per cent) of men spent money on a ‘manbag’ in the last year.

While a new fashion trend is a key purchasing incentive for 14 per cent of women, the figure shoots up to 23 per cent amongst men.

In addition, 22 per cent of male consumers claim to be motivated by innovation when they purchase a new bag for example bags with speakers for playing music.
