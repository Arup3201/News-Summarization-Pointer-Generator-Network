A horse owner has been jailed after his cob was found hanging from a cliff face because he left it tethered too close to the edge.

Samuel Smith, 54, tied his young male gypsy cob near a sheer 50-ft drop at Pakefield near Lowestoft, Suffolk.

The colt was later discovered hanging off the cliff face from the rope that had been left tied around its neck.

Despite attempts to save the horse by RSPCA workers and veterinarians, the colt died from a collapsed windpipe.

Dangerous: Samuel Smith, 54, had left the young colt tied up at Pakefield cliffs in Suffolk - leaving him perilously close to a 50-ft sheer drop

Smith, from Kessingland, Suffolk, admitted causing unnecessary suffering and failing to meet the horse's welfare needs after the incident.

As well as being jailed he was banned from keeping animals for 15 years by Lowestoft magistrates.

The court heard how RSPCA inspector Nicky Thorne was called to the scene where the horse had fallen last March and managed to cut the unconscious piebald colt free with her pocket knife.

Veterinary surgeons battled for six hours to save the horse with the help of fire-fighters and coastguards, but it died from a collapsed windpipe on arrival at the Norfolk-based Redwings Horse Sanctuary.

Inspector Thorne said after the hearing: 'This was a tragic case which highlights just how dangerous tethering can be.

'Dozens of people were involved in trying to save that poor little horse on a cold, wet and windy night - but just one person was responsible for leaving him tethered beside a steep cliff and then hanging by his neck over the edge.

'The prison sentence shows how seriously the court took this case and should act as a deterrent against the reckless use of tethers on horses left unattended like this.'

Nic de Brauwere, a senior veterinary surgeon at Redwings who took part in the rescue, said: 'There is no doubt that the horse suffered terribly, which is harrowing enough in itself.

'But what is most upsetting is the knowledge that the whole incident was completely unnecessary.

'Inspector Thorne behaved with incredible courage and we felt at the time that he might have a chance, but sadly too much damage had been done.

'I thank the courts for recognising the tragedy and futility of this incident and hope that anyone who tethers their horses will be reminded that if it has to be done at all tethering has to be done properly or there can be dire consequences for the horses and ponies involved.'
