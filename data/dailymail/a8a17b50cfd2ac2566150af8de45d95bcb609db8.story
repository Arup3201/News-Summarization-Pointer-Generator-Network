Buyers paid up to $17 million for canvases said to have been created modernist painters such as  Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell.

But it now appears that most, if not all of the 63 works of art (which fetched almost $80 million in sales) were nothing more than fakes and painted in a garage in Queens, New York.

'Thief': Glafira Rosales is accused raking in more than $33million by selling phoney artwork to New York galleries

Gallery president: Ann Freedman sold 40 works of art for Knoedler & Company thinking they were masterpieces when they were in fact fake. The gallery raked in $63 million

Authentic: This is what a REAL Jackson Pollock painting looks like

The paintings were instead created by an artist (73-year-old Chinese-American painter Pei-Shen Qian,) who was paid a few thousand dollars each to create the counterfeit masterpieces.

Federal prosecutors have not named or charged the painter. There are few details except that it is known he trained at Manhattan art school and was selling his work on the streets of New York City until a Chelsea art dealer converted his work into a multi-million dollar fraud.

Glafira Rosales, an obscure dealer from Long Island, has been charged with wire fraud, tax evasion and money laundering, after a lengthy FBI inquiry.

Investigators say Ms. Rosales sold 40 of the counterfeit works through Knoedler & Company and received about $63 million from their sale.

Atelier: The gallery owners were told the works of art had been in someones private collection and sealed up. In reality they were being created in a garage at this home in Queens

Talented: Pei-Shen Qian, 73, a quiet 73-year-old immigrant from China, is suspected of having fooled the art world by creating dozens of works that were modeled after America¿s Modernist masters that were later sold for more than $80 million

Another $17 million was garnered after sales through a second Manhattan dealer, Julian Weissman.

Ms. Rosales has pleaded not guilty and was released earlier this month.

Knoedler, until recently one of New York’s oldest and most respected art galleries, its former president Ann Freedman, 65, and Mr. Weissman have both repeatedly said they believed the works they sold had been authentic.

‘I am as shocked as everybody, more shocked, as I am the central victim. Fifteen years. In my head, these paintings have been right. Horrible,’ she told New York magazine.

Knoedler sold 40 of the fakes for an alleged $63 million.

Before shutting down abruptly in late 2011, the gallery made a $20 million payment to Rosales.

The saga all began when Rosales approached Ms. Freedman claiming to represent a foreign collector who ‘was of Eastern European descent, maintained residences in Switzerland and Mexico, wished to remain anonymous, and had inherited the works ... from a relative.’

 ‘The story was credible,’ said Ms Freedman to New York magazine. ‘Dealers often do not know the specifics of origin or background, or how the art left the artist’s studio. You cannot turn the pages of an auction catalogue or museum publication without seeing a majority of the works labeled ‘private collection.’ The chain of ownership is often out of order and incomplete.’

Low-profile: This is the garage in Queens where  Pei-Shen Qian over a period of 15 years churned out at least 63 drawings and paintings that carried the signatures of artistic giants like Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman and Robert Motherwell

Freedman says that she did her best to get answers from Rosales. ‘I went to Glafira and pushed and pushed to get more information, relentlessly,’ Freedman said. ‘My ongoing diligence met more than the gold standard; there is plenty of evidence of that.’

She even claims that she had the paintings checked over to ensure their authenticity.

‘They were very credible in so many respects,’ says Freedman. ‘I had the best conservation studio examine them. One of the Rothkos had a Sgroi stretcher. He made the stretchers for Rothko. They clearly had the right materials. I got a consensus. Some of the paintings were featured on museum walls.’

Some experts were convinced due to the quality of the paintings that they could only have been achieved by the artists themselves.

‘‘The fact is that the entire Eastern establishment believed in them. I saw the paintings,’ said Stephen Polcari, a scholar of Abstract Expressionism ‘And they were very good. You wouldn’t think twice about them for a second. Ann did everything she could possibly do.’

Near-perfect copy: Rosales allegedly sold bogus versions Willem De Kooning works similar to this authentic piece worth more then $3million

A true original: This authentic Mark Rothko oil on canvas is part of 'Selections From the Collection of the Guggenheim Bilbao'

Did she know? Ann Freedman ended up leaving Knoedler, until recently one of New York¿s oldest and most respected art galleries, around the time suspicions were aroused. The gallery then folded after more than 160 years

But others were not convinced so easily. One of the first experts to publicly identify some of these paintings as forgeries, Jack Flam, president of the Dedalus Foundation told the New York Times that  not only the works themselves, but also the backs of the paintings and the way the canvases were treated and the frames constructed were virtually identical to that artists originals.

‘The way we look at reality is highly influenced by the context it’s presented to us. The fact that they were sold by Knoedler, a respected gallery, influenced people’s opinions, he said.’

The newly painted fakes were even heated, cooled and exposed to elements outdoors in order to make them appear older than they were.

Stories were even created to explain the appearance of so many never-seen-before works.

Both Mr Weissman and Ms. Rosales said  the works had come from a family friend who had inherited the paintings. That they had been in the family since the 1950s and kept in a sealed container.

Things began to unravel for the gallery in 2009 after forensic testing on two paintings supposedly by Robert Motherwell revealed paint chemicals that were historically inconsistent. Suspicion descended on the lot, and mufti-million-dollar buyers agitated for their refunds. Meanwhile, the FBI began circling Rosales.

Ms. Freedman left Knoedler just as 
these suspicions began to emerge. Soon, the 165-year-old business shut 
up shop without warning - the very same week the buyer of the $17 
million Pollock sued both the gallery and her.

Now the lawsuits have begun with eight customers so far suing after claiming they were duped into purchasing forgeries.

Ms.
 Freedman’s lawyer, Nicholas Gravante Jr. told the Times ‘Rosales’s 
confession confirms that Ann Freedman was the central victim of this 
criminal scheme.’

Knoedler’s
 lawyer, Charles D. Schmerler, said in a statement: ‘If proven true, the
 new allegations against Rosales are a sad development for the entire 
art world.’ He said that claims Knoedler knowingly sold inauthentic 
paintings were without foundation.

Astonishing:  'Untitled' by Jackson Pollock was one of the forged works. How imitations of the most heralded Abstract Expressionists by a complete unknown could have fooled connoisseurs and clients remains a mystery

Philip Vann, a Cambridge-based art historian told MailOnline that he is sceptical about how 'convincing' such so-called 'masterpieces' could ever appear to art experts.

'Usually when such a body of forged work is examined en masse and in retrospect, something stylistically awry, anachronistic and perhaps even downright dodgy becomes evident to the discerning eye.

But if Mr Pei-Shen Qian's work avoids and evades all such doubts, then his quite unique, if totally deceptive artistic flair would be a matter of some wonder!'  

The paintings from Rosales proved to be enormously lucrative for the Ms. Freedman’s gallery.

Among the sales were a ‘de Kooning’ that went for $4 million, a ‘Rothko’ for $8.3 million, and a  'Pollock’ for $17 million.

‘If something had been off or wrong on any one of the paintings, I would have put on the brakes,’ she told New York Magazine.

She was so convincing, and so convinced, about the paintings that she even bought three herself — a ‘Rothko,’ a ‘Motherwell,’ and a ‘Pollock.’

‘I was a believer. Not to be stubborn, but I lived with three of those paintings,’ she said. ‘I lived with them, and in the context of my personal collection.’
