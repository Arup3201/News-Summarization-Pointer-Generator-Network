Enjoy it while it lasts: A satellite image from Dundee University shows an almost completely cloudless Britain - but the conditions are not expected to last beyond the middle of this week

First the heatwave, now the downpour.

Britain baked in glorious sunshine over the weekend, as this satellite image showed the entire UK basking in completely cloudless skies.

But forecasters predicted that the unbroken blue skies across Britain were too good to last - for the South East at least.

The Met Office today issued a severe weather warning for the area saying people can expect potential torrential rain and claps of thunder combined with a steamy top temperature of 28C.

Cloud cover is also expected to sweep in by the end of the week thanks to a pattern of cool air coming in from Scotland.

The rest of the country will be cooler than yesterday but dry, a Met Office forecaster said adding that the thundery weather will head to the Midlands and Northern Ireland tomorrow.

Elsewhere it will be sunny but cloudy but further north it might be wise to pack a jumper as the temperature is set to plummet to 14C.

It's due to be more unsettled on Wednesday across much of the country and cooler with temperatures in the low 20s for most parts.

At least there's some good news for the upcoming Jubilee weekend: it's going to be dry for most places.

Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said weekend temperatures would be 'not too exciting' but 'pleasant enough'.

He added there was a small chance of showers on the eastern side but most areas would remain dry.

Today fields of gold shimmered in the Spring sunshine as the biggest buttercup meadows in the UK bloomed in the heat wave.

The top temperatures were spread around the country, as Santon Downham in Suffolk experienced a sweltering 27.7C, as well as Sheffield.

In early afternoon, parts of London were also basking in heat of 26.3C.

A carpet of yellow is now covering the ancient plains in Hatfield Forest, Essex, thanks to days of warm sunny weather, which have made it a 'perfect year' for buttercups.

Visitors have been flocking to see the spectacular sight as half a billion flowers fill 400 acres of natural pasture.

'It is a sea of yellow at the moment and the buttercups look amazing in the sunshine,' said Henry Bexley, countryside manager for the National Trust in Essex and South Suffolk.

'We have around half a billion buttercups here as the wood pasture provides the optimum growing conditions.

'We do not use pesticides or fertiliser, it’s a totally natural pasture which is what produces such a brilliant show of flowers.

'They are a sun-loving flower so the heat wave has brought them out in force and they are looking at their best this week.'

He said the wet weather in April had helped the flowers to flourish on the plains and the high temperatures over the last week have brought on the golden spectacle.

'It’s the best time of the year to see the buttercups and we have had lots of visitors coming to see them,' he added. 'They look amazing, but sadly will only be around for another couple of weeks.'

Golden wonder: In Upper Swaledale walkers were treated to meadows of wild buttercups filling the patchwork of fields in the North Yorkshire Dale

Yesterday the mercury hit 27.9C at Porthmadog in Wales. Everywhere people made the most of the sunshine packing out Britain's beaches and parks.

But drivers were left in a sticky situation in Southampton after the heatwave caused a bridge to melt. The surface of Cobden Bridge began to soften and was damaged as the tarmac sizzled in the spring sunshine.

Motorist James Brent, 31, said: 'I started driving along the bridge and you could feel your tyres sticking to the road. It was very bizarre. There were tracks all along the bridge.'

Booking their place on the grass: Students were among those north of the border who took to Edinburgh's Meadows for some al fresco literature

Councillor Asa Thorpe, head of Transport for Southampton City Council, said: 'When roads get hot they do have a tendency to melt in these extreme temperatures.

'As soon as we think there is a risk to life or property we will be doing something about it. We are asking the public not to panic.'

Meanwhile, in Bournemouth, Dorset, roads were packed during the morning and seafront car parks filled before breakfast.

Thousands of deckchairs and sunloungers were snapped up and beach huts along the seven miles of sand were in use. An estimated 70,000 people flocked to the beach and thousands more were at Sandbanks along the coast in Poole.

Unsettled: It's due to be more unsettled on Wednesday with temperatures in the low 20s

There were keen day-trippers on the beaches by 7am, desperate not to miss a moment of the sun. Ice cream salesmen were doing a roaring trade, seafront traders were delighted and many hotels were fully booked.

Neighbouring resorts in Highcliffe and Swanage were also busy while the Purbeck Hills and New Forest attracted thousands of walkers.

Bournemouth's promenade, gardens and pier were packed and the local economy has been given a timely shot in the arm. The sea temperature was 12C and many people were cooling off in it.

By lunchtime, temperatures were into the 80s and the whole country was experiencing sunny, cloudless skies. Danny Smith and his wife Sue, both 40, were on Bournemouth beach with their daughters Tanya, eight, and Natalie, six.

Mr Smith, a surveyor from Southampton, Hampshire, said: 'We came down on the train this morning. It's the best way to get here from Southampton because when the sun is out the roads get really busy.

'The beach is fabulous and the water is really clear. The kids absolutely love it and it's a great way to spend a day. Living in this country means you can never guarantee the weather so when it is hot you've got to make the most of it.'

Sticky situation: Workmen had to repair the road over Cobden Bridge in Southampton after it started to melt in the weekend's soaring temperatures

Ice cream salesman Mike Harding said: 'These are the days we dream of. They've been queuing all morning and I expect to be busy all day.

'I will almost certainly run out of some varieties and will be re-stocking through the day.'

In Somerset, the weekend almost turned sour for two teenagers who got into trouble on the Bristol Channel.

The pair were enjoying the sweltering temperatures and blazing sun at in Burnham on Sea by going out on their dinghy buy were blown out about half a mile into the water.

Fortunately the pair managed to attract the attention of local coastguards and were rescued around 11am. One of the boys was treated for shock back on the beach by an ambulance crew but the pair sustained no other injuries.

There was a tragic outcome in Buckinghamshire over the weekend, however, when a man drowned while swimming in a lake in Milton Keynes.

The 21-year-old went missing in Caldecotte Lake, Milton Keynes on Saturday evening after taking advantage of the warm temperatures and going swimming.

Specialist search and rescue teams carried out an extensive search of the lake and surrounding area.

His body was recovered today at 11.10am. Thames Valley Police are appealing for witnesses.
