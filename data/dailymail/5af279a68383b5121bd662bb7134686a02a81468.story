These stunning photos show three explorers paragliding over some of Pakistan's most breathtaking landscapes.

Petar Loncar, Veselin Ovcharov and Francois Ragolski spent six weeks soaring above the Karakoram mountain range bordering Pakistan, India and China.

They can be seen paragliding at more than 20,000ft over beautiful valleys, secluded villages and some of the world's highest peaks.

Breathtaking landscape:  Explorer Petar Loncar, 27, from Serbia, soars above the Karakoram mountain range, which spans the borders between Pakistan, India and China

Stunning views: Mr Loncar and his fellow explorers Veselin Ovcharov and Francois Ragolski spent six weeks paragliding at more than 20,000ft over the range

Impressive feat: They can be seen flying over some of plant Earth's highest peaks, including K2 (the world's second highest mountain), Masherbrum and Rakaposhi

Flying high: The breathtaking photos - taken by French director Adrien Nisa, 31 - show the trio soaring above snowy peaks, beautiful valleys and secluded villages

The spectacular photos were taken by French director Adrien Nisa, 31 - known as Shams - in a bid to change global perceptions about the country.

They show the explorers flying over hundreds of snow-capped peaks, including K2 (the world's second highest mountain), Masherbrum and Rakaposhi. 

Mr Loncar, 27, from Serbia, said the feat - which saw the trio paraglide over the range every day for six weeks - had been a dream come true.

'Pakistan is the only 
place on earth where you can fly at this altitude due to the 
configuration of the terrain and high mountains,' he said. 

'Like a fairytale': Mr Loncar, 27, from Serbia, said the feat - which saw the trio paraglide over the range every day for six weeks - had been a dream come true

Suitable conditions: 'Pakistan is the only place on earth where you can fly at this altitude due to the configuration of the terrain and high mountains,' said Mr Loncar

Warning: The explorers, who have been paragliding together for around five years, had been warned that travelling in Pakistan can be dangerous. Above, Mr Ovcharov

'It was a dream of ours to explore the biggest part of the Karakoram mountains and K2 summit. We
 saw the most incredible landscapes and highest summits in the world 
from a bird's eye view which was an invaluable experience.

'If 
anyone tried what we did they would feel like the richest person in the 
world because that feeling of freedom is something nobody can buy.'

The explorers, who have been paragliding together for around five years, had previously ventured to other mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas in Asia.

However, they were warned that travelling in Pakistan can be dangerous - even for a team of four. 

Despite this, they sought out remote villages in the country to act as launch sites, before using specialist equipment and oxygen supplies to climb to the dizzying heights.

High hopes: The explorers hope to change perceptions about Pakistan. Above, the team, left to right, Mr Ragolski, Mr Loncar, friend Shusad, Shams and Mr Ovcharov

'The day before leaving, we were told not to go because it is too dangerous, but we went anyway,' said Shams. 'I never felt like I was in danger at any time during the trip. I hope this footage will give another vision of this beautiful country.'

Mr Ovcharov, 31, from Bulgaria, and Mr Ragolski, 26, from France, agreed that the trip had been 'like a fairytale'.

'Some of the peaks we flew over and around were the biggest and steepest in the world,' said Mr Ovcharov. 'It was like a fairy tale because normally you would need days or weeks to look at them if you were climbing or walking,

'We
 saw a bunch of them in a matter of a few hours using the 
simplest aircraft - a paraglider and the magic of mother nature.'
