Strangers have raised more than $114,000 in a single day for a young pregnant widow whose husband was shot dead during an early-morning mugging.

Nathan Trapuzzano's family set up a Go Fund Me page to help his widow Jennifer raise their baby girl, who is due next month, and pay for funeral costs. By Friday, it had raised more than $130,000.

The school where Mr Trapuzzano, 24, was a software engineer also said it will grant a full two-year scholarship to his unborn daughter.

Loss: Nathan Trapuzzano, pictured with wife Jennifer, was looking forward to the birth of his baby girl

'The Ivy Tech Community College family 
is shocked and saddened by the sudden loss of one of our own, Nathan 
Trapuzzano, a young and bright software engineer at the college,' a statement read.

Police
 are still searching for two suspects who shot Trapuzzano, who was out for his morning walk, in the 
stomach during what police believe was an attempted mugging outside a 
tire shop at 5.50am.

The suspects have been seen on security camera footage running from the scene.

He was found injured outside the Tron Tire Shop, Fox 59 reported.

Police believe he was shot during a struggle with a would-be mugger, while another man acted as a lookout. He died at hospital a couple of hours later.

The
 victim had been due to celebrate the birth of a baby girl, who the 
couple had planned to name Cecelia, and his first wedding anniversary 
next month.

His traumatized family released a statement on Wednesday, saying: '[Nathan] was so in love with his wife Jennifer, and unborn baby daughter, Cecelia. He was so excited about being a new Daddy.

'Nathan
 Trapuzzano was the most kind-hearted person you would ever know.  He 
never had an unkind thought in his head ... The loss of this very, very 
special young man has been such a shock to our entire family.'

Mr Trapuzzano was committed to his Catholic faith and regularly volunteered as a sidewalk counselor outside a city abortion clinic.

His priest, Father Roberts, paid tribute to the 'serious young man [who also] knew how to have fun'.

He recalled feeling honored to marry the couple last year and said: 'My prayer for Nathan and his wife was simple, "May God grant you many, many happy years".'

In his touching tribute to Mr 
Trapuzzano, Father Roberts said the victim's murderers had taken 'the 
life of one of the best young men I have ever known'.

Julie,
 who is Mrs Trapuzzano's sister, posted a statement on the site thanking
 those who had donated and sent messages of support.

'Just knowing that others care so much is really helping us through all of this,' she wrote, before adding that her sister had visited a doctor on Wednesday and was told the couple's unborn baby was doing well.

The college where Mr Trapuzzano worked also paid tribute to the victim, who they described as a 'young and bright software engineer'. It has also offered a scholarship for the couple's daughter, the Indy Star reported.

Mr Trapuzzano was a self-taught computer expert. He had studied Classics at university and had graduated from Ball State in 2011.

Faith: Software engineer Nathan was devoted to his wife and the Catholic Church

One of five children, Mr Trapuzzano had always had a strong faith and was raised in Pennsylvania.

'He had his whole life in front of him, never been in trouble before, never been a problem, was minding his own business, doing what anybody in our community should be able to do and that is to take a morning walk,' Commander David Hofmann told 6ABC.

No motive for the shooting has yet been found, and police say Mr Trapuzzano did not appear to be carrying anything valuable as he went for his regular early morning fitness walk.

Footage from security cameras installed at the tire shop where he was attacked has been released as police try to identity and catch the suspects.
