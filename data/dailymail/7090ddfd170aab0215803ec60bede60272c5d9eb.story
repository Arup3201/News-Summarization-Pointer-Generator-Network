It is not the prettiest of towns, nor the wealthiest, but it does seem to possess the secret to a successful marriage.

Six out of ten adults in Wimborne Minster are married, the highest proportion in  England and Wales and twice the rate of Manchester and some inner London boroughs.

‘East Dorset is the marriage hotspot of the country,’ said David Plumtree, of estate agency Barnard Marcus, which compiled the most married and most divorced districts, based on newly released figures from the 2011 national census.

‘This rural idyll is an especially attractive place to live because of its romantic landscape – sitting between the New Forest to the east and the Dorset coast to the south – and its relaxed pace of life.’

Wimborne Minster has a population of 15,000 and was once home to Thomas Hardy.

It is surrounded by beautiful countryside, has plenty of historic buildings, a lack of modern architecture and a church which has attracted pilgrims for centuries.

In the town and the surrounding East Dorset district – total population 87,000 – 59.4 per cent of adults are married, compared with 25.6 per cent in Islington, 27 in Lambeth, 27.4 in Hackney, 29.4 in Southwark and 29.7 in Manchester.

The area’s most recent claim to fame was in 2009, when it was revealed that it had the highest life expectancy in the country, with 86 per cent of women and 75 per cent of men expected to live to the age of 75.

The other most-married districts are Amersham in Buckinghamshire and the surrounding Chiltern district at 58.5 per cent, followed by Hart in Hampshire – named last year as the place with the highest quality of life – at 58.4 per cent.

They were followed by South Northamptonshire at 58.2 per cent, Wokingham 57.6, Mid Suffolk 56.7, North Kesteven in Lincolnshire, 56.7, Hambleton in North Yorkshire 56.5, Surrey Heath 56.4 and Harborough in Leicestershire, at 56.3 per cent.

Although not far from the attractions of Bournemouth, Wimborne Minster’s couples might benefit from being inland, as nine out of the top ten most divorced districts are seaside areas.

The list is led by Hastings, where 16.5 per cent of the population have had a marriage break-up. In Blackpool, the figure is 16.3 per cent, Margate 15.2, Torbay 14.8, Weymouth/Portland 14.7, Gosport 14.6, Eastbourne 14.4, the Isle of Wight 14.1, Corby 14.1 and Worthing at  14 per cent.
