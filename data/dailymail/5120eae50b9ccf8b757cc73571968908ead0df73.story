Four of the tragic child victims of Sandy Hook Elementary School gunman Adam Lanza lived within short walking distance of the $1.5 million home the killer shared with his mother, whom he also killed.

The startling measure of how close knit the community of Sandy Hook  really is comes as it was revealed that one of the victims of the school massacre, six-year old Dylan Hockley, was a neighbor to the 20-year-old shooter.

And it is now known that three other victims, Jessica Rekos, 6, Grace McDonnell, 6, and Chase Kowalski, 7, all lived within a one-mile radius of the troubled killer who shot dead 26 people in cold blood, including 20 children 1st grade children at the Connecticut school on Friday.

Around those homes, police officers 
are now patrolling the streets of the affluent neighborhood and have 
sealed off Yoganada Street, where Lanza lived with his mother Nancy and 
where Nicole and Ian Hockley are grieving the loss of their boy.

Just
five minutes walk from there at the junction of a main road is the 
beautiful family home where Grace McDonnell lived with her parents on 
picturesque Bresson Farm Road.

it is possible to actually see Adam Lanza's home from the front door of 
the McDonnell family residence.

McDonnell has been described as 'utterly adorable' and 'full of life.'

While her parents have not yet spoken to the media, the MailOnline has learned that they are going through 'indescribable' pain.

Neighbour Dorothy Werden, 49, said: 'I just choke up when I think about it.

'I used to see her waiting for the school bus over the road from our house every day.

'She had blonde hair and blue eyes - she was like a little Barbie doll.'

Compounding the sense of a community tragedy, just one street along from Bresson Farm Road at Bennetts Bridge is where Chase Kowalski lived with his now bereaved parents.

Modest compared to the other properties in the area, the Kowalski's declined to speak to the media and the police officer assigned to their home said that the family was grief stricken.

And then from there, just a ten minute walk along Bennetts Bridge is the home of Jessica Rekos, who lost her life to the random mass shooting that Lanza inflicted upon the devastated town of Sandy Hook.

Poignantly the family pet patrols the front of the Rekos family residence on Sweetbriar Lane, it's barking the only noise heard on the silent street packed with homes decorated in the most elaborate Christmas lights.

In the driveway of the home, basketball nets stand and when Jessica's distraught mother answered the door she declined to comment.

Indeed, the close knit community has been hit hard by the tragic events of Friday and has closed itself off from the gathered media.

Back on Yoganada Street, where Lanza's and the Hockley's homes are, police patrol cars are parked across the road closing off access to the quiet street.

All of Lanza's child massacre victims were first-graders, aged six or seven.

Seven adults, six women who worked at the school, plus Lanza's mother also died at his hands, before he killed himself.

The day before his killing spree the 20-year-old 'Goth' was reported to have visited the school - where he had been a pupil at least a decade ago - and had an 'altercation' with four members of staff.

Three of those four are now among the dead.

However,
it was still not clear yesterday precisely what caused Lanza, a 
socially awkward loner, to snap, though detectives said they had found 
'clues' thought to be emails, at his mother' Nancy's home on Yoganada 
Street.

Police said 
they had found ‘very good evidence’ they hoped would answer questions 
about the motives of the 20-year-old gunman, described by those who knew
him as brilliant but remote.

And investigators said they found no note or ‘manifesto’ of the sort they have come to expect after other murderous rampages.

Just
one person, a woman who worked at the school, was shot and survived – 
an unusually small number in a mass shooting – and police lieutenant 
Paul Vance said her testimony would be ‘instrumental’ in the case.
