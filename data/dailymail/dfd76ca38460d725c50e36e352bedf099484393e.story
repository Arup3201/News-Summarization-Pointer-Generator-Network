He has never once expressed remorse to the family of the 77 people he slaughtered in cold blood.

But mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik apologised to his mother for ruining her life before she died of cancer this year, according to a new biography.

The controversial book, entitled The Mother, is based on hours of conversations with Wenche Behring Breivik by journalist Marit Christensen.

It details the emotional last meeting 
in the surroundings of an austere prison cell between Norway's notorious
 killer and his mother in March.

Wenche was taken by ambulance to visit her son in jail. Glass divided them on previous visits but this time Anders Breivik was allowed out.

Still in handcuffs, he put his arms over and around his mother in a hug. 'Sorry that I have ruined your life,' he whispered, the book said.

By contrast, Breivik showed no compassion for his victims, saying in court that he would do it all over again if he had the chance.

His father, a retired Norwegian diplomat, said after the killings that he wished Anders had never been born.

'I
 hate him,' Wenche Breivik said of her son after days spent recovering 
from the shock of the killings in a psychiatric hospital, the book says.

Afterwards, she felt guilt and feared that she could be killed in a 
revenge attack.

'You can never stop loving your child... It's nature,' Christensen said of Wenche Breivik's conflicting emotions.

In the book, Breivik's mother once described herself as the world's 'saddest mother' who both hated and loved her son.

It
 also details how his mother had no inkling that he was planning the 
attacks on July 22, 2011, cooking him a dinner of spaghetti that got 
cold as she waited in vain for his return and watched the news of 
bombings and shootings by an unknown killer.

anger from the Breivik family

She
 broke down in tears when the police came to her house that night to say
 Anders Breivik was to blame for the massacre - a bombing in Oslo that 
killed eight and a shooting rampage on a nearby island that killed 69, 
many of them teenagers.

Wenche
 Breivik broke off cooperation with Christensen just before her death, 
saying she did not want the book published. Publishers Aschehoug went 
ahead, arguing it was in the public interest.

Jens
 Breivik, father of Norwegian mass-murderer Anders Behring Breivik, 
spoke out today against a book about his late ex-wife in which he is 
negatively portrayed.

He is described in the book as a 'domestic tyrant', according to Norwegian Daily Dagbladet.

Speaking
 to Norwegian radio station P4, Breivik said the description of him in 
the book was fictional, and stressed that the author did not contact him
 while she was writing and researching the book.

He said: 'It's completely made up. Almost nothing is rooted in reality.'

Both Jens Breivik and his former wife are controversial figures in Norway.

When
 told that his son had massacred people in cold blood, Breivik, a former
 diplomat who lives in France, told reporters that Anders had ruined his
 plans for a peaceful retirement.

The
 marriage ended when the couple's son was only one year old, and 
Norwegian social services recommended that the boy be taken into care at
 the age of four due to his mother's mental health problems.

Wenche Behring Breivik was due to speak at her son's trial, but pulled out at the last minute.

She
 initially consented to publication of the book, granting the author 
several interviews, but she withdrew her consent shortly before she died
 in March, claiming that she had been tricked and coerced.

Lawyers
 acting for her estate were expected to announce today whether they 
plan to sue the publisher Aschehoug for releasing the book against their
 client's wishes.

Breivik, a right-wing anti-Islamic fanatic now aged 34, is serving Norway's maximum sentence in jail for the attacks, which were aimed at the Labour-led government and its youth wing.

At the release of her book, Christensen told reporters it was unclear what caused Anders Breivik to become a killer.

She said it was probably a blend of factors including genetics, family background, and social and political influences.

Before the attacks, Wenche Breivik believed her son's explanation that he had become interested in hunting when she questioned why he had a rifle and a shotgun in his bedroom.

A year after the killings she considered - but did not make - an appeal, to say: 'Dear fellow citizens, he who caused the tragedy also struck me. If I go out, someone will shoot me! I am the saddest mother in the world today.'

'(I) have been terribly sad and cried a lot. In addition to the grief of losing a son the sense of guilt weighs heavily on me. It would be easier to bear if he was dead ... his punishment is also my punishment.'
