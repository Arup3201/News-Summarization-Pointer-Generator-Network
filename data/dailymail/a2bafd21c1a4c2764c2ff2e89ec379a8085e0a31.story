Fernando Torres says he returned to Atletico Madrid to experience the special Vicente Calderon atmosphere after scoring his side's winning spot-kick in Tuesday night's penalty shoot-out victory over Bayer Leverkusen.

The former Chelsea striker, on loan from AC Milan, netted from the spot before Leverkusen striker Stefan Kiessling missed his penalty to send Atletico Madrid through to the Champions League quarter-finals with a 3-2 shoot-out victory.

The 30-year-old, who left the Spanish capital for Liverpool in 2007, admits he returned to his first club for those occasions.

Speaking to Teledeporte, Torres said: 'I'm happy to see the fans being happy from the first to the last minute. I wanted to live these nights in the Calderon again.'

Substitute goalkeeper Jan Oblak had to step up in the shoot-out, replacing the injured Miguel Moya before denying Hakan Calhanoglu from the spot.

On the shoot-out, Torres added: 'That was not easy as people think. We suffered a lot, which made us more cautious. When they began to break the game down we had to regain control.

'When it comes to penalties, the team with the greater decisiveness wins.'

The victory made front page news in Spain with AS showing a picture of Arda Turan shouting in celebration with Mario Suarez and Miranda with the headline 'What a way to go through!' while Marca's headline read: 'The quarters as heroes' with an image of Atletico's players celebrating after Kiessling's miss.
