England did not make a mistake on Tuesday in keeping faith with Alastair Cook.  Neither did they make a mistake by backing every player bar Matt Prior who let them down so badly at Lord’s. But they did mess up in taking so long to let the public know their third Test plans.

There was never any question of Cook jumping or being pushed, but in waiting until gone 3.30pm to announce a 13-man squad for the Ageas Bowl on Sunday, the selectors allowed speculation to run wild.

Cook was going to be sacked, it was said. Cook was going to stay as captain but he was going to be rested for the rest of the season, it was suggested. Cook wanted to quit but was talked out of it, was another rumour doing the rounds.

Scrutiny: The duo of Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores have really struggled so far this summer

The truth is England are holding their nerve on Cook while the captain himself, described as a ‘stubborn so-and-so’ on Tuesday by one of those closest to him, has no intention of giving up on the leadership just yet.

His future was not even on the agenda when Peter Moores, James Whitaker, Angus Fraser and Mick Newell met and decided, as expected, to bring in Jos Buttler for Matt Prior and retain those others who threw the Lord’s Test away.

The bottom line is that Cook has three Tests to save his captaincy and he accepts he will have to go if he cannot regain his form at Southampton, Old Trafford or the Oval and England lose this series.

For what it’s worth, I absolutely agree with that, even though I appear to be in an increasing minority with some very credible sources now saying that time should be called on Cook, for his own sake as much as England’s.

Nasser Hussain and Mike Atherton are two of the most respected voices in cricket — to be honest, they should be running the English game but administration’s loss is the media’s gain —and when they speak I usually listen.

But even though those former England captains have said that Cook should go, I believe he has earned the right to try to do what he did in India two years ago and overturn a 1-0 deficit to win a Test series.

Cook has been badly let down by his senior players, those who England hoped would not only create the right culture and environment for young players to thrive, but would also set the right example with their performances.

Cooky crumbles

Pressure: Alastair Cook is under significant scrutiny as England captain 

Instead, Ian Bell, such a key figure, is in almost as bad form as Cook, Prior has been forced to concede defeat in his battle against the ravages of time and Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad had the perfect chance to win the second Test on the first day but under-performed when conditions were made for them.

Cook is said to be in more defiant mood than in Australia, when he considered packing it all in after the Sydney one-day international. He believes there were signs at Lord’s of his form coming back, he is getting on well with Peter Moores and is learning to compartmentalise after becoming a father.

Those clamouring for his head should remember that we are talking about one of England’s best-ever batsmen and a captain good enough to win that series in India and the Ashes last summer, before England’s world came tumbling down. Most important of all, he is a decent man who commands respect.

That England collapse has been spectacularly rapid and another pillar of the side which went to No 1 in the world has gone now that Prior has admitted he is not fit enough to continue.

Coming in: Jos Buttler has been called in to replace the injured Matt Prior

Poor form: Ian Bell has been struggling nearly as badly as Cook with the bat

The keeper-batsman has been integral to England’s successes and has been a selfless, positive presence in the team. We should wish him well while appreciating that some senior players must remain.

The form and fitness of another of those senior men — Stuart Broad — was a much bigger issue for the selectors yesterday and it would be no surprise if he was told to rest his damaged knee at the Ageas Bowl.

England may have picked a virtually unchanged squad — Simon Kerrigan was only ever at Lord’s as part of his rehabilitation — but Sportsmail understands they will make three changes, Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes almost certainly coming in as well as the gifted Buttler, perhaps for Broad and Ben Stokes.

Stokes is in a horror batting run but is a big part of England’s future. His presence in the squad shows they want to carry on working with him and the other young players who have created such a good impression this year.

Issues at the crease: And his batting form has suffered badly as well in recent times

Dip: He is without a century now in 27 innings, and is averaging just 14 this year

For that is the paradox. Every new face introduced by England has done well to a degree and they will be joined in Southampton by the hugely talented Buttler, who has done so well in limited-overs cricket.

A word of caution. Buttler, the most inventive of batsmen, is far from the finished article with the gloves and may make mistakes, as Prior did when he emerged in 2007. Patience, a virtue in understandably short supply after a run of seven defeats in 10 winless Tests, may be needed with him.

The seniors do not deserve as much patience and there were some harsh words in the England dressing room on Monday night. There will be more from the coaches on Friday when England convene again in this non-stop series with the need for more heart, passion and desire emphasised by Moores and Paul Farbrace.

It was never going to be easy this year after a 5-0 humiliation in the Ashes, but it is proving far tougher than anyone involved with England ever imagined.

What Alastair Cook, Peter Moores and Paul Downton need to do more than ever is hold their nerve. The signs yesterday were that they are doing just that.
