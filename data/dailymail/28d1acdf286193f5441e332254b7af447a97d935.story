Probe: The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 fave an Ofcom investigation after interviewing Anjem Choudary after the Woolwich death of Drummer Lee Rigby

Broadcasting regulator Ofcom is investigating the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 over their decision to give airtime to Anjem Choudary after soldier Lee Rigby’s murder.

Shocked viewers complained when the radical cleric refused to condemn the killing in Woolwich in interviews with Channel 4 News, BBC2’s Newsnight and ITV’s Daybreak following Fusilier  Rigby’s death on May 22.

Choudary admitted he knew one of the suspects, Michael Adebolajo, after meeting him at Islamist demonstrations.

Conservative peer Baroness Warsi said at the time that hate preachers who are ‘idiots and nutters’ should not be put on air.

She added she was ‘really angry’ that broadcasters were ‘giving a platform to one appalling man who represents nobody’.

After receiving 22 complaints from viewers, Ofcom has launched an official probe.

The watchdog said there were grounds to look at whether the programmes met ‘acceptable standards’.

Choudary appeared on Channel 4 News and Newsnight on May 23. He told Kirsty Wark on the BBC2 show he was ‘shocked’ by the murder but did not ‘abhor’ it.

Home Secretary Theresa May said the Government had to look at ‘whether we’ve got the right processes, the right rules in place in relation to what is being beamed into people’s homes’.

Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former colonel in the British army,  said the cleric should be banned but stopped short of calling  for a wider prohibition on extremists.

He told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: ‘I think we should consider actually banning this individual but not necessarily others.’

Fusilier Rigby, 25, was buried last week at a service at Bury Parish Church in Greater Manchester attended by thousands.
