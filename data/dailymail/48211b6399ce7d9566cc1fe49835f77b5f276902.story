Trials of video technology will not be coming to football any time soon after lawmakers rejected the idea for at least the next 12 months.

The Dutch FA had wanted to use its system in the Dutch Cup next season but the International FA Board meeting in Belfast wants more information before giving the green light. 

FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke described the introduction of video technology as the 'biggest decision which would come out of this IFAB ever' and said that while future discussions were possible, they would not be rushed.

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke had been keen to push forward live trials but other delegates were more cautious which means it will be at least another year before the go-ahead can be given.

The Dutch FA presented their data on the top to the English, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FAs but not to FIFA.

While the reception was generally good, Welsh FA chief executive Jonathan Ford said: 'We shouldn’t as IFAB just allow experiments to be conducted willy-nilly.'

However, a move to change the 'triple punishment' has been agreed in principle, so that a player who is sent off for a straight red card for denying a goal-scoring chance when conceding a penalty is no longer suspended for the following match.

Irish FA chief executive Patrick Nelson said: 'IFAB did agree that this punishment is too harsh and that we must find a solution to the matter. IFAB has tasked FIFA to look into the feasibility of implementing this on a global level.'

Proposals to allow a fourth substitute in extra-time, which had been put forward by FIFA, were rejected.

'IFAB remains of the view that three substitutions is adequate,' said Nelson, but the issue has been referred back to its technical panels for further analysis.'

Goal-line technology has already been successfully brought in but it won't be joined by video replays...yet
