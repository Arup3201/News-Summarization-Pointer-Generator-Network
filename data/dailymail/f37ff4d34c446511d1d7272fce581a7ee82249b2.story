She caused no shortage of controversy as a fresh faced 16-year-old on Australia's Next Top Model.

And former reality series contestant Cassi Van Den Dungen was back in the headlines on Monday after leading a parade of excruciatingly thin models down the runway at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.

The now 21-year-old mother-of-one looked dramatically thinner than her teenage self as she revealed her slim legs, protruding elbow joints and gaunt and sunken cheeks, but has hit back at claims she is too skinny.

Courting controversy: Model Cassi Van Den Dungen faced a recent backlash after looking gaunt at Alex Perry's Australian Fashion Week show

Shock: The 21-year-old's skeletal frame drew more than one concerned eye as she displayed her thin thighs and protruding elbow joints at Alex Perry's runway show

Posting two photos of food on her Instagram account the next morning, Cassie left a string of hashtag references defending her skeletal physique.

'Love my job, love food, I am who I am, deal with it' (sic) she wrote alongside a photo of a buffet filled with yogurt, fresh fruit and pastries.

A second image posted minutes earlier shows a rucksack filled with Starburst and Haribo sweets, two butter croissants, a banana, a can of energy drink and bottle of water which she boasts is her breakfast for the day.

Taking to the runway at Alex Perry's Autumn/Winter showcase on Monday, Cassi was one of a host of worryingly thin models prompting seasoned front row spectators to voice concern.

Before: Cassi had a much fuller face when she appeared on the show in 2009

Mia Freedman, the creator of Mamma Mia,  dubbed the show: 'The hunger games', while Jackie Frank, editor-in-chief of Marie Claire was compelled to phone one model's agent to inquire after her health.

'When I saw those legs I nearly died,' she told The Daily Telegraph.

'I rang the model agent and said, "Why is that girl walking down the runway when she's clearly not healthy?"'

Defending her frame: Cassi posted two images of food on her Instagram page on Tuesday morning writing, 'Love food, I am who I am, deal with it.'

The fashion industry has long come under fire for their tiny sample sizes which promote the development of unhealthy eating habits.

Models feel intense pressure to fit the sizes or face loosing their livelihood.

Brazilian stunner and Victoria's Secret model Alessandra Ambrosio headlined Alex Perry's runway on Monday and speaking to Today on Tuesday morning said she enjoys eating bacon and egg sandwiches before her shows.

The striking Victoria's Secret alum cut a much healthier and athletic figure as she walked alongside the skeletal Australian models.

Cassi was the runner up in the 2009 cycle of Australia's Next Top Model which was won by Tahnee Atkinson, who in contrast is known for her curvy and voluminous figure.

The young model drew media attention for her angry, foul mouthed outbursts and smoking habit on the show, and famously turned down a modelling contract with a New York agency.

Since finishing the popular competition series, she has been working locally and internationally, appearing at the Melbourne Fashion Festival and walking for up-market brands such as Miu Miu in Paris.

She is also mother to her nearly three-year-old son Drake who was born with a cleft lip and palate.
