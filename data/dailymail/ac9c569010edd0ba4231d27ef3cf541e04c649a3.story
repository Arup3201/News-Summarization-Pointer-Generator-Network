The grandfather who helped his wife and five grandchildren escape
a Tasmanian bushfire by leading them to safety under a jetty returned 
to his house to find it completely destroyed, he revealed today.

Tim Holmes, 62, built his home himself but was helpless to save it as 'tornadoes of fire' swept through his village of Dunalley.

As they became surrounded by flames, his only option was to shepherd his family into the sea, where they sought refuge for nearly three hours before fleeing in a dinghy.  

Hero: Grandfather Tim Holmes led his wife and grandchildren into the sea as a last resort as he watched the fires destroy the house he had built himself

They were later reunited with the children's mother, who feared they had all perished after hearing they had become trapped in the water.

Mr Holmes said: 'It’s all gone, every 
last item, but it’s a great sense of relief to think that we lost not 
one hair on a child’s head.

'All
the things that we've lost, yeah, there's some precious memories there.
But they can be replaced, material things.

'But my 
wife and children, not so easily replaced. Yeah, I just feel blessed 
that my family's all together.'

Speaking after their emotional reunion, the children's mother, Bonnie Walker, said she 'prayed like I
never prayed before' that her family would survive.

She had left her children - Charlotte, two, Esther, four, Caleb, six, Liam, nine, and 
Matilda, 11 - in the care of her parents on Monday as she had to attend a funeral.

My prayers were answered: Mrs Walker feared her family had all been killed after hearing they had been cut off by the fires that ripped through the town of Dunalley

Brave: Mrs Walker's children tell how the fire came at them in all directions leaving them trapped in the sea

But it was only after leaving the area she realised the marauding wildfires had swept into the village. 

Mrs Walker drove to the service in the capital Hobart as fire 
ravaged the land either side of her and just made it through before the 
flames crossed the road and cut her off from her family.

Meanwhile, her husband, David, was hiking along Tasmania's southern coastline unaware of the unfolding drama.

She told Australia's ABC network: 'We just waited by the phone and received
a message at 3.30pm to say that mum and dad had evacuated, that they 
were surrounded by fire, and could we pray.

'So I braced myself to lose my children and my parents.'

Mr Holmes told how he and his wife Tammy led their five 
grandchildren into the sea as their only hope as he watched the house he had built himself go up in flames.

Mr Holmes took the picture as he feared their mother might not see them again

Escaping the flames: The family's pet dog Polly also sought safety on the jetty as the family huddled together in the water

Divine intervention: A building burns near the jetty. The family credits God with their survival from the fire that destroyed around 90 homes in their town of Dunalley as the country was hit with record temperatures

Even there, their 
terror was not over as flames licked the wooden jetty they clung to and 
they struggled to breathe in the smoke-filled air.

With
the oxygen supply quickly running out in the polluted air, Mr Holmes 'rallied against all the odds' to retrieve 
the dinghy from the foreshore.

The ordeal was photographed by 62-year-old Mr Holmes, who 
moved to Australia from Wales, as he feared his daughter my never see her children alive again.

The iconic image of them huddling under the jetty has now been seen around the world.

Mr Holmes said: 'We saw tornadoes of 
fire just coming across towards us and the next thing we knew everything
was on fire, everywhere, all around us.

'By that time I had sent Tammy with the children to go down to the jetty because there was no escape, we couldn't get off.'

After
two and half hours in the water, he found a dinghy and ferried the 
family to safety. ‘We had water up to our chins and could barely 
breathe, it was so toxic,’ he said.

Mr Holmes told how he sent his 
wife, their grandchildren and pet dog Polly to the nearby sea jetty when
he saw smoke from the looming wildfire rise from a nearby ridge.

Despite the arrival of three fire trucks, the 62-year-old realised he could not defend the home he had built himself.

'I looked at the firefighters and said, "I have to go to Tammy and the kids",' he told the West Australian.

'For
the next two-and-a-half hours, we huddled under the jetty as the fire 
intensified and produced a plume of smoke, ash and debris that left us 
with very little oxygen.

'There
were times when we had to move out deeper because it was too hot and 
there were times when the jetty itself caught fire. I was able to scoop 
some water onto the jetty and put it out.'

Thanked God: The children's mother, Bonnie Walker, was unaware of the impending danger when she drove off to attend a funeral and feared her family had been killed when she heard of the devastation

They eventually made their way to safety as the fire burnt itself out.

The family credits God with their survival from the fire went on to destroy more than 100 homes in the village.

Mrs Walker said: 'I spent a lot of time with good friends and prayed like I've never prayed before and I think those prayers have been answered.'

Meanwhile, it emerged today that raging bushfires in south-east Australia are heading towards an army range littered with unexploded bombs.

The
blaze at Dean's Gap, in New South Wales, is just a kilometre away from 
an area that the military used as a bombing range until the 1970s.

Firefighters
are confident that they can stop the fires, which are the result of 
soaring temperatures and protracted spells of intensely hot temperatures
that have been felt in all corners of the country.

Fires continue to cause concern in western, central and southern areas, and Tasmania has been hit particularly hard.

A large blaze is still burning out of control by the Tasman peninsula, near areas already hit by major blazes over the weekend.

More than 20,000 hectares of land and 120 homes have been destroyed, but no deaths have been reported.
