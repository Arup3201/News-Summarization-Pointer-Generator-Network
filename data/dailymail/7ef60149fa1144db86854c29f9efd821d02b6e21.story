Silvio Berlusconi has married his fiancée in a secret wedding at his private chapel, a friend has claimed.

The three-time Italian premier, 77, is said to have wed former TV showgirl Francesca Pascale, 28, at a church inside his palatial villa near Milan, three weeks ago.

The couple, who met when Miss Pascale was a teenage activist in his Forza Italia party, have been knocked in recent weeks by allegations that their relationship is ‘a sham’.

Miss Pascale is seeking Euro 10million damages after a TV station broadcast claims by Bulgarian actress Michele Bonev that she is in fact a lesbian. She says the comments are defamatory.

Now close friend ‘Bunga Bunga’ girl Marythell Polanco has said that she was invited to a secret ceremony, which took place just days before Miss Bonev’s claims surfaced.

Asked on Italian radio if the couple would get married, the Dominican model and singer revealed: ‘They are already married.’

Miss Polanco explained: ‘It’s not a civil marriage, but Silvio has a chapel in his house. He was able to do it there and no one knows anything about it.’

She told Italian station Radio2: ‘They invited me but I couldn’t go because I was in labour with my son.

‘But anyway I sent my congratulations. They got married two or three weeks ago- on 8th or 9th October’, she said.

Miss Polanco admits to being a guest at dozens of Mr Berlusconi’s parties and even released a pop song called ‘Bunga Bunga’, which she says Berlusconi helped her to write.  

The attendees have claimed that the 
soirees were elegant dinners followed by burlesque shows. But 
prosecutors at Berlusconi’s trial for sex with underage prostitute Ruby 
the Heart-stealer described them as ‘Bacchic orgies.’

Miss
Polanco, who was a witness at the trial and is now under investigation 
for perjury, first found fame when she told the court that she had 
dressed up in an Obama mask to perform a striptease to please 
Berlusconi.

The news 
comes as Berlusconi faces a split in his centre right party and a vote 
to expel him from Parliament after a conviction for tax fraud.

But the glamorous TV presenter said that
despite Berlusconi’s political woes, he continues to host bunga bunga 
parties. ‘It’s the one thing they can’t take away from him, she said. 

‘Bunga bunga will never end. As long as there is Berlusconi, there will always be bunga bunga.’

Miss Pascale had also been a guest at bunga bunga parties, where she had danced the conga, Miss Polanco claimed. 

The marriage reportedly took place several days before actress Miss Bonev wrote on her blog:  ‘The "love story" between Francesca Pascale and Silvio Berlusconi [is] a big sham, because Francesca is lesbian, and I have been more than a friend to her,' she wrote.

'Silvio decided to announce his engagement to Francesca only so he could continue to have fun with her and her "friends", and not be judged by the public,' Ms Bonev added.
