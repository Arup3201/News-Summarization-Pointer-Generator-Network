A man who went shopping with his wife but then got bored is celebrating after he wandered off and bought a winning lottery ticket.

Robin Kiddie, 60, decided to leave his wife Christin, also 60, to get the groceries at Tesco in Ludlow, Shropshire, while he went to get a ticket.

His boredom paid off to the tune of £6,299,421 after Saturday's draw when his numbers came up.

He only found out about his win on Monday because he fell asleep after getting home from the England vs France rugby match and only 'half-checking' the ticket.

Robin and Christine Kiddie will split the money with their four children with whom they were in a syndicate

The couple put their success down to a wish they made at a fountain in Rome while they were on holiday

Initially Mr Kiddie thought he had four or five numbers but it was only on Monday when he looked again that he learned of the good news.

He sent a message to his children saying 'I've got good news - we've won the lottery' and it will now be shared among them because they are part of a syndicate.

Celebrating their success at Fishmore Hall Hotel in Ludlow, Mr Kiddie said:  'I'm excited, nervous and a bit confused. I was on two days holiday last week and haven't been doing the lottery every week but happened to be in Tesco in Kidderminster.

'I was at a loose end waiting for Christine so I put the lottery on. And it was pay day as well. But I didn't find out we'd won untIl Monday because I was at the rugby on Saturday watching England v France.

'I drove home Sunday so by the time I got back I was pretty knackered. I thought maybe I've got four or five numbers but I went to bed.

'I went to work the next day, logged on to my computer and thought I would check the numbers to see how much we had won. I saw we had six numbers and I checked and I checked and then came off the website and went back on and checked again.

'A colleague was walking past and I 
asked him to tell me if the numbers were the same. I text my children 
before I phoned Christine. It said something like 'I've got good news, we've won £6.2 million on the lottery'.

The couple celebrated their £6,299,421 win at a hotel in Ludlow, Shropshire

Mr Kiddie didn't realise they had won the lottery until Monday morning because he was too tired to check the tickets properly

'But I got sceptical texts back. Thing like "oh yeh, I'll have a car" or "you can get me a house". They just didn't believe us.'

The couple say they believe their win
may be down to a wish they made while on holiday in Italy at the Trevi 
Fountain. They visited Italy in 2008 and vowed to return there 'if they 
ever won the lottery.'

Mr Kiddie added: 'We took my mother there a few years ago when an opportunity arose. She said she would like to go back and we said we would go back when we won the lottery.

'We threw a coin in the Trevi Fountain just because that's what people do. I don't remember the exact wish but during the holiday we said we wanted to win the lottery so we could come back to Rome - so I suppose it came true.'

The couple's £6 million win is part of a family syndicate with their four adult children, who wished to remain anonymous.

Describing the moment her husband broke the good news Mrs Kiddie, a bank nurse at Ludlow Hospital, said: 'Robin told me to sit down and said he had something to tell me. He said "we've won the lottery". I said "don't be stupid".

'I thought he's losing his marbles now. 'So I phoned my mother-in-law because I thought if he's told her then it must be true because he wouldn't dare tell her a lie.

The couple hope to go back to Rome after vowing they would return if their numbers came up

'This only happened on Monday so it hasn't really sunk in yet. I'm just happy for the kids, they're going to be financially secure for the rest of their lives.

'It's nice that we can see them enjoy the money rather than have it after we have gone.'

The couple, from Ludlow, who have four grown-up children and five grand-children, now plan to pay off the mortgage and buy a new Mercedes for Mr Kiddie as they decide whether to move house or where to go on holiday.

Mrs Kiddie added: 'The children live all around the country but we went for a big family meal on Tuesday night.

'I've barely slept five hours since Monday so we haven't had chance to see friends too much yet. It's all such a shock.'
