Custody: Kenneth Konias Jr, 22, was caught in Florida after allegedly killing Michael Haines and stealing $2.3million from the security van they drove

The armored van guard who killed his partner and stole $2.3million has been captured after going on the run.

Kenneth Konias Jr, 22, waived his right to a removal hearing today in Florida,  hours after he was arrested in Pompano Beach.

He will be transported back to Pittsburgh to face charges.

Konias allegedly killed fellow guard Michael Haines inside their Garda Cash Logistics truck on February 28 and disappeared with the millions.

Haines' body was found in the back of the truck by co-workers where it had been dumped under a Pittsburgh bridge.

Around
$275,000 was recovered following the theft but it wasn't immediately 
clear if authorities had located more of the missing cash.

After escaping from the crime scene, Kenneth Konias Jr called his mother telling her to: 'Go see grandma.'

Police said Konias' relatives found 
$24,000 stashed at his great-grandmother's grave site and another 
$200,000 in his parents' home.

Konias allegedly confessed to a friend last month, phoning up to tell him: 'I f***ed up. My life is over.'

Slaughter: Michael Haines was allegedly shot at point blank range by his collleague

Grim discovery: Michael Haines was discovered dead in the truck when it was found idling under a bridge in Pittsburgh in February

The truck had picked 
up money from the Rivers Casino shortly before 9am on February 28 and was found 
about 3.40pm, after the guards had made several stops elsewhere, police 
said.

Pittsburgh police major crimes Cmdr. Thomas Stangrecki said at the time  that surveillance video from the area shows the truck had been parked 
under the bridge since shortly before 1.30pm that day.

'This is a premeditated murder,' 
Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala told Wpxi.com.

'Our belief is 
that he planned to rob the company and if he had to kill the guard then 
he planned to do that.

'He shot the guy from close range in the back of 
the head to accomplish the robbery. That’s pretty cold.'

Homicide detectives went to the address where Konias lived with his parents in Dravosburg, Pennsylvania and found his bloody uniform jacket in his bedroom.
