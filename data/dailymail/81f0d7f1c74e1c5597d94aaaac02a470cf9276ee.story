An Oregon man's family watched helplessly as a rogue wave swept out to sea while he was attempting to perform a tightrope walk Thursday between two rock formations, authorities said.

James Michael Alejanddo, 25, of Portland, went missing near Pacific City after a wave hit him as he made his way over the rough seas. He was not wearing any kind of safety equipment.

Witnesses say he was briefly seen in the ocean but they lost sight of him. He has not been seen since.

Where it happened: Alejandro was swept out to sea tightrope walking between cliffs at Cape Kiwanda, on the northern coast of Oregon

Alejandro was climbing on a rocky area of Cape Kiwanda with several others Thursday afternoon when he connected a single rope between two large rock sections above the water and tried to walk it.

He attempted to make the daring walk without the benefit of a secondary line or harness, sources told The Oregonian. Authorities believe he was with family members.

A Coast Guard boat and helicopters searched by water and air but didn't find Alejandro. The search is expected to continue for at least the weekend.

Authorities caution that coastal ocean currents are strong and large waves are common in the area, they often take people by surprise.
