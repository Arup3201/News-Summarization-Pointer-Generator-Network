These astonishing pictures of what appears to be a ball of flames dancing in the sky were taken by a schoolgirl after she spotted it out of her bedroom window.

Katie Real, 11, saw the bizarre fireball in the sky above her home in Northampton after going to draw the curtains on Saturday night.

She rushed to get her laptop computer and filmed a 39-second clip showing the bright object apparently performing loop-the-loop in the evening sky.

Schoolgirl Katie Real, 11, spotted the bizarre ball of flame outside her bedroom window in Northampton

She grabbed her laptop and filmed a 39-second clip in which it appears to perform a loop-the-loop in the sky

The 
schoolgirl's mother, Fiona Fearon, 30, said: 'Katie was watching a film 
on her laptop in her bedroom when she went to close the curtains and she
 saw this weird fireball in the sky.

'She quickly pressed a button on her laptop to film it, and when she showed it to me I was just amazed. 

'Initially we thought it could be a plane on fire, but it appeared to be dancing across the sky. It was an amazing site.

Katie's mother, Fiona Fearon, 30, telephoned a local airfield the next day but they didn't know what it was

Katie, who was watching a film when the fireball caught her eye, said: 'I would love to know what it was'

'It’s very weird - it looked like a ball of fire moving around in the sky.

'It just seems to sort of float there, spin around and then disappear behind a clump of trees.'

Mrs
 Fearon said she rang an airfield nearby the following day to ask if the
 ball of light was anything to do with them, and was told it was not. 

The schoolgirl spotted the distant fireball from her bedroom window, and grabbed her laptop to film it

She added: 'I’ve read about strange lights appearing during thunder storms called ball lightning, but there wasn't lightning on Saturday night so it’s a mystery.'

Katie said: 'I was looking out of my window when a large glowing ball of light caught my eye. It was moving very fast.

'It was pretty scary and I’d love to know what it was. I’ve never seen anything like it.'
