A brave moggy, called Sally, has received hero status after it saved its owner from his burning home. 

49 year old Craig Jeeves was alerted to the fire in his Wandin North home in Melbourne early Monday morning when his pet cat screamed at him and woke him up.

It allowed the man to realise the danger he was in before he managed to escape his burning home.

Craig Jeeves was alerted to the fire in his Wandin North home in Melbourne early Monday morning when his pet cat screamed at him and woke him up.

 'She jumped on my head and was screaming at me,' he told the Nine Network.

CFA operations manager Jason Lawrence said it was just after one o'clock this morning the brigade from Wandin responded to the fire.

Fire Crews, who found Mr Jeeves in the bushes outside his home when they arrived, said he was very lucky to be alive.

'The building was largely involved in fire, flames were coming out of the window and walls,' he said.

The size of the fire meant the unit had to call for backup.

'She jumped on my head and was screaming at me,' owner Craig Jeeves told the Nine Network.

'The CFA proceeded to fight the fire from the exterior and hosing down the building. Then neighbouring crews arrived with breathing apparatus.' 

It took fire crews more than half an hour to put out the blaze. There was fairly extensive damage, with an estimated 70 to 80 percent of the house gutted. 

'The cause is being investigated but it's looking like possibly a heating appliance.' Mr Lawrence said. 

The cat's owner, Mr Jeeves, lost everything but escaped relatively unharmed.

He was treated for minor shock and smoke inhalation and will be staying with neighbours until he is able to rebuild the property. 

'I'm happy to be alive but you can't replace the memories,' he said.

The CFA estimated 70-80% of the home was damaged.
