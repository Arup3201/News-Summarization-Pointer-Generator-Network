Spanish police say they have arrested two men for the death of a football fan following a brutal street fight between rival radical fan groups before a match in Madrid two weeks ago.

Spanish police wrote on their official Twitter account that '32 ultras arrested in Madrid, Avila and Toledo for the violent incidents at Manzanares, among them, 2 alleged perpetrators of the homicide.'

On November 30, a large clash between Atletico Madrid and Deportivo La Coruna 'ultra' groups led to 43-year-old Deportivo fan Francisco Javier Romero Taboada dying later from injuries after he fell into the Manzanares River during the fight.

Deportivo took  measures against their own fans after the incident by banning hardcore members of their ultras for the next two games.

Club president Tino Fernandez told Spanish radio station Onda Cero last week: 'I am certain that we will not have any more 'Riazor Blues' at the Riazor (stadium).

'The first step we have taken is to close the 'Riazor Blues' section of the stadium for our next two home games. 

Some Deportivo fans were banned from attending the two home games after the incident

'This is the first measure as there is still an investigation going on.

'We don't have to act against an organisation because the Riazor Blues are not registered as a fan club.

'We have to act against people and we are not sure who those are just yet.'
