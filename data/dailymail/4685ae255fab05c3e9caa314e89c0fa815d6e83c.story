Every couple needs a place to raise a family and these two geese have found their home sweet home in an unlikely location - a supermarket car park.

The geese return to exactly the same spot - Sainsbury's in Cheadle, Stockport - every year to lay their eggs in a corner near the petrol station.

It is thought they choose the spot because it is near where a pond used to be in the corner of the car park.

The feathered family are now treated as VIP guests by staff, who have become rather fond of the local celebrities.

Home sweet home: Canada Geese waddle along in the car park of Sainsbury's in Cheadle, the unlikely surroundings they call home

I'll sit here: The geese are most often seen first thing in the morning, and it is thought they were attracted to the site because a pond used to be on the same industrial estate

They now cordon off the area when they arrive so the birds can nest undisturbed.

David Gaffin, manager of the Wilmslow Road store, said: 'I know they have been coming as long as I've worked here over the last three and-a-half years.

'The mother lays her eggs in the car park and the father stands by, guarding her like a proud parent. It's very cute.'

Although geese can be aggressive when protecting their young, staff and customers have never encountered any bad behaviour from the couple, apart from the occasional hiss.

Mr Gaffin said: 'They have found somewhere they like to come and nest and they must feel quite secure here. Of all the places they could go, and they choose a supermarket car park.

'Our customers are always putting pictures of them on Twitter and Facebook.

'They are like local celebrities now.

The geese are most often seen first thing in the morning, and it is thought they were attracted to the site because of the pond which used to be on the same industrial estate.

The pair usually stick around for about four to five weeks before flying off.

Just the two of us: Both Canada Geese make themselves comfortable with their surroundings

Mr Gaffin said staff were always sorry to see them leave and looked forward to them returning the following year.

He said: 'They're like part of the family now here in Cheadle.'

Canada geese are devoted parents and never leave their goslings unguarded - which is perhaps why staff have never spotted any of their babies.

They tend to return to the same breeding site year after year and often mate for life with the same partner. They have even been known to die of sadness if they lose their mate.

The species was introduced to the UK from North America in the seventeenth century.

Their permanent population is estimated at 90,000, with more migrating in winter.
