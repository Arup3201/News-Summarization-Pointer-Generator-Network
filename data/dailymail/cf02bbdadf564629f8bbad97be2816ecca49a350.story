Six tourists have died after an overcrowded tourist ferry capsized and sank off Thailand today.

Among the dead were three Thais and three foreign nationals, including one Chinese and two Russians - while the rest of the roughly 200 people aboard were rescued near a seaside town.

The double-decker ferry, carrying Thai and foreign tourists, left Lan island for the 30-minute trip to the resort of Pattaya this evening, police spokesman Colonel Suwan Cheawnavinthavat said.

Shortly after the boat departed, an engine problem sent the passengers on the first deck rushing to the second floor, causing the ferry to flip on its side and eventually sink.

‘Witnesses said there were neither enough tubes nor life vests on the ferry,’ Col Suwan said. Some of those who cannot swim had to cling onto coolers or ice containers until rescuers came.’

He said the foreigners who died were a Russian man, a Russian woman and a Chinese man. Three Thais - two women and a man - also were killed. The rest of the passengers were rescued.

Among these was a 12-year-old Russian boy who was tonight in intensive care at a hospital. None of the others were taken to hospital.

He said police were looking for the ferry driver to investigate the cause of the accident.

Pattaya, about 60 miles south-east of Bangkok, has had several fatal boat accidents this year.

Last month, an Indian tourist celebrating her wedding anniversary was killed in a parasailing accident off the town's coast.

In August, two Chinese tourists were killed in a speed boat accident near Pattaya's main pier. Lan island is a popular daytrip destination among tourists near Pattaya.
