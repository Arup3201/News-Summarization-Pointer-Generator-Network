A waiter faces being split up from his civil partner and family and deported to South Africa after government officials claim he does not earn enough to live in the UK.

Couple Matt Mallinson, 24, and Brett Rice, 28, who entered into a civil partnership in 2012, are currently battling a Home Office order which could see Mr Rice deported to South Africa or his birthplace of Zimbabwe.

The Home Office claim Mr Rice falls short of earning brackets by just £300, under rules designed to make sure foreign migrants and their partners do not rely on taxpayers to support them. 

But the couple say their forms were filled in while Mr Rice was still a student at the University of Huddersfield, and only able to work part time.

He now has a full-time job as a waiter, which takes him well past the earnings threshold.

If Mr Rice is deported he will not only be split from his partner but from his own parents, Len and Cynthia, who have lived in Huddersfield for five years after moving from South Africa.

The couple also fear what will happen if Mr Rice is sent back to South Africa or Zimbabwe, due to their tough stance regarding homosexuality.

Mr Mallinson, who is from Sittingbourne in Kent, currently lives with Mr Rice and his parents in Huddersfield.

'It is a very worrying time as it was my understanding that we could appeal the decision,' said Mr Rice.

'Now we have been surprised by the case going straight to court and I have to await legal consultation as my lawyer has had to hand my case over. 

'I'm not sure what is going to happen or where I might be going.

'The Home Office say we have to alert them to any changes such as losing a job but they now refuse to accept that my circumstances have changed considerably since the application.'

The couple awaited the Home Office response but had heard nothing back until they were presented with a letter stating that they will have to appear in court on November 18.

The UK Border Agency has also insisted that Mr Rice has spent 26 years in South Africa, even though  he came to the UK in 2009 to study at university.

He has only ever returned to South Africa in 2012, in order to apply for his visa.

He said: 'It has been very stressful situation for all of us to deal with. We both have been working very hard trying to ensure we reach the earnings requirement.

'Despite the fact we now earning the acceptable amount, we have been told it will not be taken into account.

'It is very upsetting but we are trying to not think too much about the worst possible outcome. It is a really difficult situation for us to face.'

The Home Office have insisted that they will only look at figures dating from the time of the application.

A spokesman for the Home Office said the family rules were brought in to make sure that foreign spouses and partners do not become reliant on the taxpayer for financial support, and are well enough supported to integrate effectively.

He added: 'This is fair to applicants and to the rest of the public, and has been upheld by the Court of Appeal.'

An online petition has now been launched to urge Home Secretary Theresa May to put pressure on Home Office officials, which has already attracted more than 2,000 supporters.
