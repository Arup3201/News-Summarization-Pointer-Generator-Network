Karl Oyston missed seeing Blackpool cast further adrift at the bottom of the Championship.

The controversial chairman was not at Hillsborough where Sheffield Wednesday should have won in greater comfort.

But the Seasiders did force the save of the match when Keiren Westwood somehow kept out Ishmael Miller's point blank header in the second half.

Miller, earlier cautioned for deliberately palming the ball into the net, was sent off in stoppage time for a lunging tackle that produced a second yellow.

There was a certain inevitability about a sterile first half between the two lowest scoring sides in the Championship.

Even bottom team Blackpool had mustered one more than Wednesday's 16 league goals.

It took a penalty for the Owls to draw level on 17, courtesy of a rash challenge by visiting defender Peter Clarke.

Until that 37th minute flashpoint Blackpool had suggested they could mount some sort of recovery from last Saturday's 6-1 home defeat to leaders Bournemouth.

Beyond an apology to fans, manager Lee Clark had refused to overreact, confining himself to four changes.

Jacob Murphy came close to giving them a shock lead as Wednesday threatened only sporadically.

But Stevie May, who failed with an early chance, forced the breakthrough in a run down the right.

The danger seemed to be over as he lost control and tried to recover it, but Clarke lunged in and an assistant referee flagged for the penalty - Wednesday's first in the league this season - as May tumbled.

Chris Maguire netted convincingly from the spot.

Later, May was brilliantly denied by Joe Lewis as Wednesday's second half dominance failed to produce further goals.
