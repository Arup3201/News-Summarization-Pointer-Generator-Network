A new study from Cambridge University reveals language is becoming more informal and even royalty and MPs are speaking incorrectly.

The average English child is likely to say the word 'like' five times as often as his or her grandparents and the word 'love' is used more than six times as often as 'hate'.

The research is part of the Cambridge English Corpus - one of the biggest collections of words in the English language in the world.

Development or decline: Art critic Brian Sewell is regarded as someone who uses formal English while Janet Street-Porter uses a demotic accent and grammar, the study showed

The Corpus contains written and 
spoken English from books, newspapers, advertising, letters, emails, 
websites, and recordings of conversations, lectures, TV, meetings, radio
and many other sources, totalling several billion words.

Over 20 years, researchers have formed a database which shows there is a decline in the correct use of grammar.

Michael
McCarthy, emeritus professor of applied linguistics at the University 
of Cambridge, told The Times: 'We can listen to debates in Parliament 
and hear MPs saying things like 'gonna' instead of 'going to'.

He cited a 2005 interview with Prince Charles, who was educated at Gordonstoun independent school, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme which was 'informal'.

But he said in recent years as a university lecturer, he had seen a weakness in spelling and grammar among his students.

Prince Charles' interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme was considered 'informal' while George Osborne was recently mocked for adopting a 'mockney' accent

Art critic Brian Sewell and historian David Starkey are regarded as public figures who still use formal English.

While Janet Street-Porter and footballer David Beckham are viewed as more 'demotic'.

Recently,
the Chancellor George Osborne was mocked for using informal language 
despite being educated at St Paul's and Oxford University.

Research: Cambridge University carried out the study which reveals language is becoming more informal

Claire Dembry, from Cambridge University Press, said people are now embracing the different forms of the English language.

Researchers also exam papers written by foreign students and discovered the word which caused the most confusion was 'because'.

Other
words which stump non-English speaking students included 
'accommodation', 'beautiful', 'advertisement', 'which' and 
'environment'.
