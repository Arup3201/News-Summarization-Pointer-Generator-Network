Samantha Brick appeared on This Morning today to defend her claim that women must be thin to be happy

Samantha Brick is no stranger to controversy and last week the writer caused a stir by claiming that any woman who wants to be happy needs to be on a constant diet.

42-year-old Samantha confessed that she has been on a diet for 30 years in a feature for the Daily Mail, and encouraged other women to do the same.

She wrote: 'The logic is simple and 
irrefutable: any self-respecting woman wants to be thin, and to be thin 
you need to spend your life on a diet.

'I
don't believe overweight is ever attractive. Whether we like it or not,
we live in an age and a part of the world where men and women regard 
thin as beautiful.'

Samantha was writing an opinion piece in response to news that Joan Collins had revealed that the secret to her good looks was to spend every day of her life dieting.

Samantha added: 'Joan, 79, said she controlled her weight during a long career so that she could stay in work - an entirely laudable attitude.

'Like
Joan, I have no intention of letting my body slide flabbily into middle
age. I believe that any woman with a modicum of self-respect should 
watch her figure with the same vigour. Is it any coincidence that Joan 
is still attractive and in demand for work'

Samantha's comments divided readers and she was soon trending on Twitter.

Today the outspoken blonde appeared on This Morning to defend her views that women can only be happy if they are thin.

She said: 'In the article I talk about the first time that I realised that I was overweight and overlooked and chose to do something about it. I am not suggesting that anyone follows my 14-year-old self's diet methods but we do have a massive problem in this country with obesity. 66 per cent of the population are obese and 25 per cent of 4 and 5 year olds are overweight, it is a massive issue.

'I put on weight while undergoing IVF treatment and my husband has been incredibly supportive but yes I do think that he would leave me if I got fat.'

Journalist Samantha appeared alongside Natasha Devon a writer and positive body image campaigner

Joining the debate was writer and positive Body Image campaigner Natasha Devon.

Natasha, 
who admitted that she has suffered from an eating disorder in the past,
started the Body Gossip campaign which educates young girls on 
self-esteem.

She said:'There are hundreds of ways 
to be gorgeous. We believe that healthy and confident is beauty, and 
healthy and confident means different things to different people.

'We are not all born to be skinny. 

'Women who are confident and rock their own brand of gorgeous are much more attractive.

Some people let being thin take over 
their life. I don't know much about your life Samantha but it seems that
you can't let go and enjoy yourself so I actually feel very sorry for 
you.'

At the end of the debate just 6% of viewers agreed with Samantha that you can only be happy if you are ona  diet while 94% agreed with Natasha's view that Samantha's opinion is dangerous and that we should concentrate on being healthy and happy.

Samantha told the MailOnline: 'Every woman who voted against me during the debate needs to take a long hard look at the digits on their scales.

'I find it extremely alarming that, even though 1 in 4 British women are obese and 66% are overweight - they still believe diet is a dirty word and that it leads to eating disorders. There is zero evidence to back this up.

'I've yet to meet a woman (myself included) who has lost a lot of weight and wished they remained fat. The fact remains that obesity costs British business £2billion a year and obesity is estimated to cost the NHS £6billion in the next 2 years. Who is going to pay for this?

'We've made drinking-driving and smoking in public unacceptable - we need to do the same with over-eating and the excessive consumption of calories. There are grave consequences to pay if we don't do this; there is a generation of children who will be buried by their parents if we don't recognise that eating more than we need is leaving us at risk of heart disease, diabetes and various cancers.

'I stand by my position that fat is failure. Every time someone eats more than they need they are failing themselves, their children and society - by assuming someone else will pick up the health tab for their eating habits.

'I know how hard it is to change cooking and eating habits. It took me years and is something I write about honestly in my memoir: Head over Heels in France. There is no greater pleasure than cooking your own food, with the aware of its calorie contents and eating it with family and friends.'

Natasha is co-founder of Body Gossip, a positive body image campaign

Natasha told MailOnline: 'At Body Gossip we work very hard to promote the 'spectrum of beauty'. We believe that there are thousands of ways to be gorgeous regardless of shape, size, age or weight.

'Trying to conform to a very narrow beauty ideal sadly dominates far too many people's lives and stops them from reaching their potential. Samantha's Brick's message that thin automatically equals beautiful is potentially damaging to anyone young or vulnerable that reads her work. Fortunately, times are changing and opinion's like Brick's are becoming rarer and increasingly perceived as outdated.

'The response Body Gossip has had following the debate has already been phenominal. We speak for real people, with real, healthy bodies who want to rock their own unique brand of gorgeous'.
