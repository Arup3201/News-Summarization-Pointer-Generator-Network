Chelsea have seen an opening bid of £16million rejected for Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder Douglas Costa, according to the player himself.

Brazilian star Costa confirmed on Thursday night that the Barclays Premier League leaders had been in touch about a move to Stamford Bridge – one that the 24-year-old describes as a ‘dream’.

But with Chelsea seeking a cheaper option to Fiorentina’s £27m-rated Juan Cuadrado, Costa’s Ukrainian employers are not keen on letting one of their top players go on the cheap.

Costa confirmed to local press on Shakhtar’s South American tour that Chelsea’s initial offer had been rejected – but said he would speak to his club to try to push a move through.

‘It’s a dream to play for Chelsea, a unique chance. I will try to negotiate,’ he told Brazil’s Globo Esporte.

Ukrainian champions Shakhtar are known to difficult to negotiate with, making it perhaps unsurprising that Chelsea’s bid, understood to be £16m, was rejected.

They face Internacional in Beira-Rio on Friday night in Costa’s homeland, with the Brazilian expected to play some part despite the speculation over his future.

Costa attracted the interest of Chelsea and Manchester United as a teenager at Brazilian side Gremio before moving to Shakhtar in a £4.5m deal.

Talks regarding the futures of Costa, Cuadrado and Chelsea’s Mohamed Salah and Andre Schurrle are expected to continue on Friday.
