The Russian Grand Prix has been given the green light after it passed an FIA track inspection.

The Sochi Autodrom, built on the site of the Winter Olympic Games staged earlier this year, was deemed to be in an ‘extremely good condition’ and will host Russia’s first Formula One race in October.

‘The circuit will be issued with a licence,’ race director Charlie Whiting, who led an FIA delegation in Sochi earlier this week, said.

Taking place: Formula One will head to Sochi for the Russian Grand Prix in October

‘Everything has been done according to the plans - the kerbs are very good, the verges, the guardrails, the walls - everything is in an extremely good condition.

‘Everything has been done to the highest standards and I’m extremely pleased.

‘I can say without hesitation that the circuit is ready 60 days in advance, which is very rare really. What I’ve seen today gives me complete comfort that the circuit will be entirely ready when I come back for the Grand Prix.’
