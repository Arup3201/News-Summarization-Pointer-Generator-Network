British holidaymakers face three more years of being ripped off by extortionate mobile phone 'roaming charges' after Brussels failed to scrap them as promised.

EU governments agreed that the roaming charges for mobile phone users abroad should stay in place until at least until the end of 2018.

The decision comes despite MEPs voting for an end to the charges which they said were too high. The European Parliament had said roaming charges should be scrapped by the end of 2015.

But at a meeting in Brussels, EU governments tonight agreed to allow large mobile phone firms to continue levying extra charges on travellers for at least another three years, when the situation could be reviewed.

Governments said consumers should be given a small roaming allowance to use outside their home country from the middle of next year, but any usage above it should still be subject to further charges.

The decision is a major blow to British tourists travelling to Europe. A recent study showed that the average British person spends an extra £120 on their mobile phone on each trip abroad.

The issue of scrapping roaming charges has seen the EU come head-to-head with the telecoms industry, who argue it will affect their revenues.

Some members of the parliament immediately criticised the decision.

The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats said: 'The only winners from it are national telecoms operators themselves. Member states should hang their heads in shame.'

European consumer groups, speaking through an umbrella organisation, the BEUC, condemned the plan as 'outrageous'. 'Roaming is not justifiable in a single market,' they said.

The member states must now agree a common position with both the European Parliament and Commission before changes take effect, so negotiations in the coming months are likely to be hard-fought.

Current charge caps are €0.24 (20p) per minute for calls, €0.08 (7p) per text message and €0.45 (37p) per megabyte of data, all excluding VAT.

From July 2014 those will be reduced to €0.19 (16p) per minute for calls, €0.06 (5p) per text and €0.20 (17p) per MB of data.
