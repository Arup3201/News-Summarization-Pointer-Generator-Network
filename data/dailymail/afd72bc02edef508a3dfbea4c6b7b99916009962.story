That Whitney Houston's untimely passing left her family reeling, goes without saying, but their decision to deal with this shock by making a reality TV show has caused eyebrows to raise.

While it may be cathartic on some level; the sorry sight of a bereaved family acting out horrible moments against a background of Kardashian-style suspenseful and worse still - quirky - incidental music feels grossly inappropriate.

Too much, too soon: Bobbi Kristina is comforted by Nick Gordon as she sits by her mother Whitney's grave, cameras followed her for her first visit

Place her teenage daughter's relationship with the boy Whitney took into her home at the centre of it amidst a raft of staged showdowns and hokey face pulling, and you have a carcrash.

Worse still, the opening episode features intrusive scenes of 19-year-old Bobbi Kristina, Whitney's daughter with Bobby Brown, visiting her mother's grave for the first time.

If that doesn't pull at your heart strings enough, it's also Mother's Day... and the hideous voyeurism goes further, underage Bobbi Kristina is seen drinking.

'She's not at drinking age,' her aunt complains.

Intrusive: The decision to include this painful visit is dubious at best, Oat Houston stands to the left as Whitney's mother Cissy hugs Bobbi Kristina and Nick sits by the grave

'Please visit me more': Cissys asks her granddaughter to spend more time with her in the future

Hard to watch: This scene was filmed in May... just three months after Whitney's untimely death

Family time: The whole clan went to Whitney's grave for the first time

Bobbi Kristina is seen sipping an alcoholic beverage and turning to her unofficially adopted brother-turned-fiancé, Nick Gordon. T

The horribly intrusive scene also includes Whitney’s mother, Cissy, and brother, Gary, and yet still manages to feel forced and contrived.

At least at this point, Whitney's beautiful, haunting vocal takes over... rendering the scene some awful poignancy.

Though it's hard to look at Bobbi Kristina with her head in her hands next to the headstone, despite the positivity that Whitney's sister-in-law Pat tries to channel into the occasion.

'It tastes like apple juice': Kristina's Aunty Pat doesn't want her niece drinking

'Not on my watch': Pat says she won't let Krissy fall by the wayside 'np way, no how'

Driving a wedge: Bobbi Kristina only wants to be with Nick, but Pat feels that he's taking her down the wrong path

Cissy is seen sadly telling her her granddaughter to stay in touch.

'She was just my mother,' sad Bobbi tells Nick. 'I don't care about anything else.'

Earlier in the episode, she had shown off her mother's ring which she told her shocked family represented an engagement token between the pair.

Nick told the camera: 'Everyone gets it wrong, I was never officially... it's not incest.'

There may be trouble ahead: Whitney's brother Gary is worried about his niece and his own daughter

Goofing off: Pat set up a meeting with an acting coach for Bobbi Kristina but she choose to spend time with Nick in an arcade

Promise rings: Bobbi Kristina and Nick are engaged, the former says that together with her late mother they were 'the three Musketeers'

Pat feels that Bobbi needs to focus on work to help with grieving, instead of her close relationship with Nick.

She encourages her to see an acting coach, after admitting to camera that Bobbi was happy working with Tyler Perry on For Better or Worse.

'Acting is a refuge for me,' Bobbi admits.

Tentative: Cissy and Bobbi Kristina have a fractious relationship but Pat is working on that

'I just want you to look after her': Uncle Gary offers to give Nick some advice

In pain: Bobbi Kristina is understandably suffering in the footage, with her mother not long gone

Response on Twitter was almost unanimously negative; with many commentators horrified at the state of Bobbi Kristina and the fact she was being film just three months after her mother's death.

Kommidity summed up the general consensus by writing: 'Bobbi Kristina needs prayers for strength and clarity, not a reality show! #TheHoustons.'

Shalonda No'Elle wrote: 'Wow, they started this reality show just 3 months after she died!! Why are they really doing this? #TheHoustons.'

A teaser preview at the end of the show hinted that Bobbi's relationship with her father Bobby Brown - who was arrested today in LA for DUI - will be fully explored.
