As the Pentagon prepares its major budget announcement today, the U.S. Army boss says he's comfortable with plans to shrink the size of his force and shift the military's focus to Asia, saying troops there will remain relevant and capable.

Gen Raymond Odierno declined to disclose figures the Pentagon is due to unveil that envision a smaller Army and the withdrawal of two brigade combat teams from Europe. 

Those fixed brigades will be replaced by rotational units.

Cuts: The Pentagon plans to slash the size of his force and shift the military's focus to Asia under a new budget proposal

'We're now out of Iraq, we're reducing our commitment in Afghanistan, so we can now bring the size of the Army down.

And I feel comfortable with how we're going to do that,' Gen Odierno said in an interview from his Pentagon office.

'It's more about the timeline we bring it down on, and I'm satisfied with that timeline.'

The Pentagon will preview President Barack Obama's budget proposal for the Pentagon on Thursday.

It is expected to cut $260billion in projected defence spending over the next five years and favour services like the Navy and the Air Force over the Army and Marines.

At ease: Gen Odierno says he's 'comfortable' with how the Department of Defense plans to reduce the size of the army as part of $260billion in cuts

A U.S. official confirmed media reports that the Pentagon plans to slash eight Army brigades and reduce the overall force to as few as 490,000 over the next decade from around 565,000. 

But President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta have said they will not hollow-out the force with the kind of cuts the military endured in the wake of the Vietnam War.

Prominent in the plan is a renewed focus on Asia, where China's rapid military modernization has raised worry in Washington and rattled U.S. allies.

That, along with continued security threats in the Middle East - especially Iran - is why Panetta wants to invest more in certain air and naval assets.

He also is putting a focus on cybersecurity and commando forces like those who killed Osama bin Laden last May and who swooped into Somalia on Tuesday to rescue two hostages, including an American.

The Pentagon has embraced a proposal by special operations chief Adm Bill McRaven to send more manpower and equipment to worldwide 'Theater Special Operations Commands' to strike back wherever threats arise, according to a senior defence official who spoke to the AP, and other current and former U.S. officials briefed on the program.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the details of the proposal are still being worked out, including how fast the changes could be made.

U.S. officials have pointed to concerns about China's military build-up and North Korea's nuclear advances as they explain plans to focus more on the Asia-Pacific region.

Gen Odierno, fresh from a trip to Asia, acknowledged the need for naval and air assets in any military strategy for the Pacific.

But he stressed that the Army will keep playing an important role in the region, and pointed to the 19,160 soldiers deployed in South Korea as a deterrent against the North.

Gen Odierno saw no downsizing of the Army presence in Asia and said it will further supplement its forces with troops who rotate in and out of the region.

He said: 'That's what we got to decide: How much rotational presence will we be able to do'.

Should the U.S. Army be reduced in size to help the economy?

Gen Odierno noted that the Army could play an important diplomatic role engaging with militaries in Asia, given that 22 out of the 28 chiefs of defence in the Pacific are army officers.

Seven out of the world's 10 largest land armies in the world are in the Pacific, he added.

That common army background 'will help us to build relationships,' he said.

But
several Republicans argue that even the initial cuts totaling nearly 
$490billion would 'hollow' the military and costs tens of thousands of 
jobs nationwide, adding to an 8.5 per cent unemployment rate that they 
already blame on the president's economic policies.

'While Secretary Panetta has conceded
that our nation is now accepting more risk as a result of the budgetary
vise squeezing the Pentagon, it remains unclear exactly what risks our 
nation is assuming,' Rep Randy Forbes, R-Va., a House Armed Services 
Committee member, said this week.

Odierno,
who in the past commanded U.S. forces in Iraq, has put together 
Marching Orders, a pamphlet explaining his vision for the future of the 
Army that he intends to start distributing next week.

In it, he says his intent is to maintain 'the most decisive land force in the world.'

Gen Odierno said: 'We're going to be an Army in transition. We'll be in transition for the next five or six years'.

'But
as we come out of this transition, we're going to take the lessons 
we've learned over the last seven or eight years,' he said, adding the 
future Army would be more versatile and flexible.

'The
president, the secretary [of defence] have been very clear, that they 
need a strong, capable Army. We will continue to have a strong, capable 
Army,' he said.

Change of pace: The new plan will put a focus on cybersecurity and commando forces like those who killed Osama bin Laden last May and who swooped into Somalia this week to rescue two hostages, including an American
