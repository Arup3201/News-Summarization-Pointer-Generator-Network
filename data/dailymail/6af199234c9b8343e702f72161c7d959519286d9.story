Sir Frank Williams, the team's founder and principal, said: ‘The team had a fantastic season last year, we are aiming to replicate this development over the winter and to start the 2015 season in a strong position.

'We have an enormously talented group of people here at Williams who want nothing more than the team to do well. 

'This passion produced a great turn around in fortunes for the team in 2014 and everybody has worked tirelessly to continue that climb up the grid.

‘After a very strong first year with Mercedes we are looking to further develop the relationship as we look for more podiums in 2015. I feel this year will be equally as exciting as the last and look forward to seeing the car on the grid at the first race.’
