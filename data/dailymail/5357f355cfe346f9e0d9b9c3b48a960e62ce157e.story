Nemanja Vidic has revealed that he was inundated with offers when he decided to leave Manchester United, adding that he also declined the option to remain in England. 

The Serbian announced his decision to leave Old Trafford in February after eight years with the club, before agreeing to join Italian side Inter Milan in March upon the expiry of his United contract this summer.

In an emotional interview with MUTV ahead of United’s meeting with Vidic’s Inter in Washington D.C., the defender admitted: ’I had a lot of offers from different countries, even from England. With Inter, the club are in transition, trying to improve but I like the project. Inter will get bigger and bigger and I hope I can help them achieve their aims.’

Vidic, who often reverted to using the
 word ‘we’ when talking about United in the interview, also believes 
that his former side are destined for great improvements under new 
manager Louis van Gaal following the traumatic campaign endured by David
 Moyes.

‘If you look at club
 now, United is in transition. New players coming in, we (United) have 
changed managers, with first David Moyes and now Louis van Gaal and also
 the directors last year when David Gill left (and Ed Woodward was 
promoted).

‘Hopefully this 
year is important for them and the players who have been waiting for a 
chance can step up. The players are ready for their chance.

'The manager knows what he wants from them and that is good. I hope they do well. There is new energy and the club needs positive energy, the players will be fighting for their place in the team. I’m sure it will be much better than last season.’

Meanwhile, Van Gaal’s disaffection with United’s pre-season commitments in the USA was made clear once again on Tuesday evening when he was asked by the club’s in-house media channel whether he would like to win the International Champions Cup.

If United reach the final, they will have to play an extra game in Miami and Van Gaal has already made clear his frustration with the amount of travelling United have done in pre-season.

‘No, I want to win the Premier League and my wife Truus is saying she wants me home too!’ Van Gaal said, only half-in-jest, when asked if he was concerned about progressing in the tournament.

The Dutchman did, however, swiftly clarify that it is his desire to win every match, regardless of the competition, and he also talked up the possibility of meeting Liverpool or Manchester City in the final.
