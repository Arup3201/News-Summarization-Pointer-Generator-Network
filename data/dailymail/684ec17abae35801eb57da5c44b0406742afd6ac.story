Manchester City's first team stars appeared to be in a playful mood during Tuesday's training session ahead of their European showdown with Barcelona.

Eliaquim Mangala was the butt of the jokes at Manchester City's training ground as he feigned an ankle injury following a tackle by Vincent Kompany before sharing a joke with his team-mates.

Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping his stars are fully fit and raring to go as they face a tough task of trying to overturn a 2-1 first leg defeat against the Catalan giants.

The City boss, who said earlier this month that his position will not be under threat even if his side are eliminated from Europe and fail to win the Barclays Premier League, held a meeting with his players on the training pitch before the session.

Manchester City must score at least two goals at the Nou Camp if they are to have any chance of progressing to the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

One man who believes they can do just that is right back Pablo Zabaleta - despite the Argentina international admitting Barcelona are 'one of the best teams in the world'.

'We are going to play against one of the best teams in the world. It's not going to be easy, but nothing is impossible in football,' Zabaleta told Four Four Two.

'You have to be ready for these moments. Things can change on games like this.

'You just have to move on to the next game and try to win it. That's what football is.

'It's good that the game [comes after] just three days. We need to recover well, go to Barcelona and see what we can do. Hopefully we can do it.'
