A man has enlisted the help of family, friends, a 75-piece marching band and a choir to surprise his wife with an over-the-top vow renewal ceremony on their tenth wedding anniversary.

Steven Rosenwasser, of Atlanta, Georgia, pulled off the grand gesture on November 1, explaining that he had spent an entire year brainstorming a truly memorable surprise for his wife, Kelli.

'Last year on our ninth anniversary I said to myself, "I want to do something really special and unique for her." It took about a month or two to come up with the idea and I've been planning it for about ten months, and it's amazing to see it all come to fruition,' Steve explained in a YouTube video that captured the special evening.

Steve had one of Kelli's friends blindfold her and take her to the couple's home, where she was told to put on a formal dress.

Steve then removed the blindfold, telling his wife: 'You've told me that when it comes to love, actions speak louder than words. So I wanted to show you in actions how much I love you.'

The couple was then greeted with a festive performance by a live marching band who proceeded up their driveway, followed by a choir of young women who sang a moving rendition of  'I Can't Help Falling in Love with You'.

'It was about 30 years ago, I went into school and I saw you. You had the warmest brown eyes, prettiest smile, infectious laugh, and I knew I wanted you to be my girlfriend.

'Over the last ten years and even recently, I realized just how deep my love is for you,' he added.

'I know I put up a lot of walls. You haven't simply broken through them, you haven't just touched my heart, you enveloped me. I will open myself up and be vulnerable to everything you have to give me and everything I can give you. To be vulnerable takes a lot of strength and you give me that strength.'

Longtime love: The couple have known each other for 30 years, having met in school
