Sixteen people died and 58 were hurt after a double-decker bus flipped on a tortuos Andean mountain highway and plunged into a deep ravine.

The packed bus tumbled down a 98ft slope at a spot known as the 'Devil's Curve' on the highway leading from the city of Huaraz to Pativilca in Peru's Ancash region.

Among the dead is a one-year-old baby, said Ancash province health director Carlos Segovia.

driver was apparently speeding

A spokesman for the local police told San Antonio, Texas-based newspaper La Prensa that the bus was apparently speeding and its driver exhausted.

He added that the injured were taken to five hospitals in the region and that the bodies of those killed in the accident will be delivered to their families.

The crash happened just before noon on
 Thursday as the bus was making its way to Peru's capital, Lima, which 
lies about 134 miles south-west of the site.

Rescued passengers were freed from the wreckage by police and firefighters, according to officials at one hospital which treated survivors.

The unpaved, high-altitude roads of the Peruvian Andes are notorious for bus plunges, with poor farmers comprising many of the victims.

Inexperienced drivers and poor maintainance of buses also contribute to the death toll. Last year, more than 4,000 people were killed in such accidents.

In October, 51 Quechua farmers died in southeastern Peru in the country's worst highway accident in three decades.
