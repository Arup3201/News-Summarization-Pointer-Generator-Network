India's Ravindra Jadeja proved he is a proper all-rounder at Old Trafford on Thursday by doing his best Dennis Bergkamp impression.

Jadeja, at the centre of the summer's big controversy following his set-to with James Anderson in the Trent Bridge pavilion, was playing football in the outfield and struck a pose reminiscent of the Dutchman's control in a match against Newcastle in 2003. This piece of control is now a statue outside Arsenal's Emirates Stadium.

Maybe Jadeja could be better suited to the other Old Trafford after that touch (with an orange Holland ball, as it happens), although India will be hoping he can put his skills to better use with a cricket ball as they look to regain the lead in the series.

No regrets: MS Dhoni (left) says he was right to pursue James Anderson after Trent Bridge

Meanwhile, India captain MS Dhoni said he had no regrets over pursuing the case against Anderson and said it was up to individual captains to control their players. 

ICC chief executive David Richardson said on Tuesday he would not be appealing against Justice Gordon Lewis’s decision to exonerate both Anderson and Jadeja.

India appealed against the original not guilty verdict as they sought to have Anderson punished for a Level Three offence and banned for the rest of the Test series.

That did not happen but Dhoni says that if Anderson 'carries on being abusive' he should be punished by the authorities.

And the India captain added that match officials should play a greater role in ensuring the game is played in the right spirit: 

‘It’s important that cricket has strong characters – no matter what side they play for,' Dhoni said. 'But what needs to be done is for umpires to step in if the individual crosses the line. If the individual stays within the guidelines, it’s good for the game.

‘If he carries on being abusive and cannot curb his instincts, he should definitely be punished.’

India, meanwhile, could make three changes to the team who put up so little resistance at Southampton. Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin could play his first game of the series, in place of batsman Rohit Sharma, while fast bowler Varun Aaron is in the mix, possibly at the expense of the luckless Pankaj Singh.

The tourists could go for experience at the top of the order, too, where Gautam Gambhir might replace Shikhar Dhawan.
