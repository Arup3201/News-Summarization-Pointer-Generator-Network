Prince Charles steered clear of criticising Sri Lanka's record on human rights on Friday as he made his first address to a Commonwealth summit on behalf of the Queen.

The closest the Prince came to referring to allegations of torture, kidnap and other abuses was when he said the gathering needed to address the ‘security’ of its members nations and referred to the ‘touch of healing’ the 53-nation body can bring.

Although the Queen is Head of the Commonwealth she has decided to scale down her long-haul international travel and asked her son to represent her at this year’s Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

But the Colombo-based gathering has turned into a political minefield, with Canada and India pulling out of the summit in protest at alleged war crimes and attacks against his own people by Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaska.

Charles, who is normally nothing less than outspoken about issues close to his heart, will have to bite his tongue as the Queen is required to stay publically neutral on such issues, although critics of the regime are putting increasing pressure on him to raise concerns with the president privately.

In his opening speech, Charles said: ‘At the personal request of The Queen, I am delighted to be addressing you this morning on behalf of the Head of the Commonwealth.

‘Her Majesty's deep affection for the Commonwealth, and the special importance she has attached to it throughout her reign, are well known to you all. And if I may say so, those very sentiments have been an ever-present cornerstone in my own life also. It is therefore my particular privilege and pleasure to be representing The Queen at this, the 2013 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.

‘I am especially pleased to be back among the people of Sri Lanka who, in recent years, have confronted great adversity. My last visit here, in 2005, came just weeks after the devastating tsunami had struck these shores. I visited communities affected by the disaster and met many of the relief workers who were doing so much to help rebuild broken lives and livelihoods.

‘I recall my admiration for the fortitude shown by them all at that time and commend the progress that has been made since in healing those dreadful scars.’

He said that in the early days of the Commonwealth, India's Prime Minister Nehru declared that the body ‘seemed capable of bringing a touch of healing' to the management of contemporary world problems.

‘More than 60 years later, we should not need to be reminded of the many troubles that beset our world, some of them previously little understood, nor should we underestimate the importance and responsibility of the Commonwealth's role in addressing them,’ he said.

He said the Commonwealth Charter, signed earlier this year, which enshrines human rights in the values of member states, was designed to ‘light the path of all those involved in the work of the Commonwealth.’

He added: ‘At this CHOGM, and guided by that spirit, the Commonwealth is being charged to confront the many issues affecting the security and well-being of its nations and peoples.

‘The Queen wishes you well in these vitally important deliberations.’

He concluded: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, each one of us is here because of the hope and the trust we place in the Commonwealth to bring that “touch of healing” to our troubles and deliver the very best future for our people.’

In his own speech, however, Mr Rajapaska was bullish in defence of his handling of the bitter civil war against the island’s Tamil-dominated north.

Hundreds of ethnic Tamils protested in the main northern city of Jaffna before British Prime Minister David Cameron's arrival, demanding answers about the thousands who went missing near the war's end in 2009 between soldiers and ethnic Tamil rebels

He said: ‘We in Sri Lanka are stepping into a new era of peace, stability and renewed economic opportunities that have long been denied to my people due to the menace of terrorism that existed for nearly three decades.

‘In ending terrorism in 2009 (when the civil war with Tamils in the north ended) we asserted the greatest human right of all - the right to life.

‘I'm happy to say that in the last four years there has not been a single terrorist-related incident anywhere in Sri Lanka.’

He added that the Commonwealth ‘should not be a punitive or judgemental body’.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who hosted the last summit and passed over the chairmanship to Sri Lanka's President, urged the president to grasp the bull by the horns, saying that recent events in South Africa and Ireland showed that ‘intractable’ problems could be solved.

Before the Prince made his speech to open the summit, the heads or representatives of the 53 member nations were announced one by one and took their places on the stage.

Britain’s Cameron was seated two rows behind the Prince, with the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Gordon Darcy Lilo, on his right and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame on his left.

Mr Cameron gave President Rajapaska a round of applause when he came onto the stage at the conference theatre (which is also named after him).

The Prime Minister has defied calls to boycott the Commonwealth summit and today will put his concerns - including demands for an independent inquiry into alleged war crimes by state forces - directly to the Sri Lankan president in a face-to-face meeting.

As many as 40,000 civilians are estimated to have died in the final months of the regime's 26-year fight with Tamil Tiger separatists according to the UN, which wants an international probe if no new inquiry is held.

Mr Rajapaksa rejects claims his forces indiscriminately shelled Tamils fleeing the intense fighting as the Tigers - themselves a brutal guerrilla movement - were defeated and of battlefield executions and rapes.

Among the VIPs in the audience were three of the president's brothers, who are the Speaker, Defence Secretary and Minister for Economic Development, and his three sons, who all play for the national rugby team, of which one is captain.

Meanwhile, The Duchess of Cornwall declared herself a ‘huge fan’ of the Harry Potter books and films on an official visit to a public library in Colombo.

Camilla, who supports several literacy initiatives in the UK, described author JK Rowling as ‘brilliant’ and said she was very sad when the seven-book series came to an end.

While her husband tip-toed his way through the minefield that is Commonwealth politics, the Duchess spent the morning at Colombo’s Public Library’s where she recognised the achievements of children from all religious and ethnic backgrounds - Tamil, Sinhalese, Christian and Muslim – in an annual writing competition.

She also presented a prize to Shenuka Corea, the overall winner of the 2012 Commonwealth Essay Competition, which has been run by the Royal Commonwealth Society since 1883. 

It is the world's oldest and largest essay competition and is open to all Commonwealth citizens aged 18 or under, offering young people the opportunity to make their voice heard on a global platform.

Wearing a pretty cream and beige Anna Valentine dress, the Duchess arrived to a lively traditional local welcome, featuring brilliantly clad dancers and drummers, before chatting with several of the talented youngsters.

Krishnavi Rathnaranjan, 14, who wrote an award-winning essay on ‘why reading makes you perfect’ told her that JK Rowling was her favourite author.

Camilla replied: ‘Oh I love Harry Potter. Have you read all the books and seen the films? I was very sad when it finished. She is a brilliant writer.’

The Duchess was also asked to light a ceremonial candle before the official prize giving ceremony.

Referring to her husband, who almost set his jacket alight yesterday when he brushed past an oil burner, she said: ‘I hope I don’t set this alight. We’ve already had enough trouble.’

As she left Camilla thanked everyone and promised to return. ‘I hope I will be back before too long,’ she said.

The Duchess is keen to promote the benefits of reading. Her Royal Highness is Patron of the National Literacy Trust, BookTrust and First Story, all of which are UK charities that help to promote literacy in young people.
