A refrigerated lorry packed with 48 Albanian stowaways was stopped from entering the UK via the Channel Tunnel, it has emerged.

The group, which included women and children, was discovered in the back of an HGV during a routine check at the Channel Tunnel terminal in Coquelles, near Calais, in northern France.

Following the discovery, a Border Force official warned that using refrigerated lorries and sealed tankers to smuggle people across borders could result in fatalities.

The check was carried out at around 9pm on Tuesday as the lorry was waiting to board a shuttle to Folkestone in Kent.

The lorry, whose refrigeration unit was not turned on, was empty apart from the Albanian nationals on board.

It was due to drive to Dover to pick up a load for delivery to France.

There was no external lock or seal on the lorry when it was checked by Border Force officers who found the 41 male and seven female stowaways apparently in good health.

Three of them were believed to be minors. All were handed over to the French authorities while the Romanian lorry driver was arrested by French border police who are investigating.

Dave Hutchinson, Border Force deputy director for South East and Europe, said: ‘The dangers of using refrigerated lorries and sealed tankers in this way are self-evident. The consequences are potentially fatal.

‘This case demonstrates the complete lack of regard the organised criminals involved in people smuggling have for the individuals concerned. It is even more alarming given that some of those found were minors.’

Sniffer dogs, heartbeat detectors, carbon dioxide probes and physical searches are some of the methods used by Border Force officers to find people hiding in vehicles.
