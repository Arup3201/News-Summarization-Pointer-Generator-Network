A typical Christmas shopping list usually consists of toys, electronics, gift cards, etc. But now, some women are adding positive pregnancy tests to their list -- and checking it twice. 

Women across the country are selling and buying positive pregnancy tests on Craigslist. 

One post from Claremore, Oklahoma offered a positive pregnancy test for $20. 

The advertisement stated: 'I have positive pregnancy test for those of you who need a little help holding onto your man through the holidays, shoot me a message for $20 each.'

Lock: This ad from Lake Charles, Louisiana advertises the positive test as a way to 'lock that new man down'

Responsibility: In a New Jersey add, one seller refuses to take any responsibility for the test after it's sold

Keep: A number of the pregnancy test advertisements offer the test as a way to 'keep' a significant other

Posts from Kansas, California, New York, Texas, and others have advertised the tests as a great prank or a way to 'keep your man,' while some ads clearly state that the buyer doesn't care what is done with the false test. 

Many of the tests range in price, some are being sold for $15 and others for $50.  

A Kansas police officer,  Gary Mason, explained to KCTV how the false test could be used negatively. 

Price: The average cost  of the tests are $20 with prices going up from there

False: Gary Mason, a Kansas police officer, said that if someone used the false test for misrepresentation, that could be a 'level of blackmail'

'For example, if a married man is having an affair and he tried to break it off with the girl, and she became upset and decided to present this fake pregnancy test and demand money, otherwise she would tell the spouse,' Mason said. 

'That would be a level of blackmail.' 

Those who buy the test could face charges including libel, emotional stress, or misrepresentation, according to FOX23.

If the case escalated, those fooled by the fake test could even press fraud charges. 

More and more the saying is becoming true, one really can buy anything on the internet.
