Showing bloodied men kicking and punching each other as hundreds look on, these pictures prove that there really is no such thing as a free lunch.

Every fighter who took part in this traditional martial arts competition in Indonesia today was entitled to a meal ticket.

But first they had to show what they were made of in the ring in the latest round of a contest where just about anything goes.

Ferocious: A fighter is thrown upside down during the traditional martial arts competition in Indonesia

Out for the count: A fighter faints after being kicked by an opponent during a no-holds-barred contest

Pencak Dor is a no-holds-barred competition staged by students at an Islamic boarding school in Kediri, East Java.

Contenders punch and kick their opponents at will in the ring as spectators and judges watch.

Some fighters leap into the air to launch an attack on their rival, often dealing painful blows to the head.

At least one fighter fainted after competing today, and others required medical treatment for facial injuries.

Pencak Dor bouts end when a fighter throws in the towel, blood has been spilled, or referees decide to stop them.

Once they leave the ring, fighters are entitled to a meal ticket as a reward.

Fighters are trained at Pencak Silat, martial arts schools affiliated with Indonesia's largest Muslim organisation, the Nahdlatul Ulama.

The martial arts competitions often take place on the anniversaries of the deaths of well-known Muslim scholars or on the country's Independence Day, August 17.

The fighting is ferocious, but is arguably not as dangerous as other historic combat events - such as the pankration, a martial art introduced into the Ancient Olympics in Greece in 648 BC.

Pankration was founded as a mix of boxing and wrestling but with almost no rules. Only biting and gouging of an opponent's eyes were disallowed.

Events would sometimes end in a fighter's death.
