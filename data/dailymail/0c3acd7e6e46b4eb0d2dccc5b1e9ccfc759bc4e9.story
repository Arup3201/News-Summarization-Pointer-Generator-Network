Fraud: Cheats are costing the taxpayer £200m a year by forging prescription forms (file picture)

Fraudsters who claim free prescriptions they are not entitled to face strict checks in a crackdown designed to save the NHS millions.

The move follows the revelation that prescription fraud costs the taxpayer more than £200 million a year – enough to pay for some 10,000 nurses.

Cheats get free medicines by pretending to belong to the categories of people exempt from charges.

Children, pensioners and those with certain long-term medical conditions do not have to pay the £8.05 charge that is standard in England.

Those paid Income Support, Jobseeker’s Allowance and Universal Credit are also exempt.

To avoid the charge, patients simply tick a box on the back of the form declaring they are entitled to free medicines. Pharmacists are meant to ask for proof but many feel uncomfortable doing so. If a patient does not have written proof, the pharmacist ticks another box saying ‘evidence not seen’.

Very few people are thought to be caught for cheating – so the millions who should pay but avoid doing so know they have a high chance of getting away with it.

Professor Mark Button, director of the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at Portsmouth University, said: ‘People think it’s a soft touch.

‘The man in the street thinks, “Do I know anyone who’s got caught for prescription fraud? No.” ’

An insider said that pharmacists will now be forced to check claimants’ credentials – or risk having their NHS contracts revoked. The source said: ‘Pharmacists’ NHS contracts specifically state they are obliged to check a patient is entitled to free prescription medicines.’

Patients could even be denied free medicines until they prove entitlement. ‘That option has not been ruled out as too radical, as long as safeguards were put in place to protect vulnerable groups,’ the source added.

Both ideas will meet strong resistance from pharmacists, who are opposed to prescription charges in principle and do not think it is their job to ‘police’ the system.

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society believes prescription charges – which have been abolished in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – ‘act as a barrier to people accessing life-saving medicines’. It wants them abolished for all people with long-term medical conditions.

Patients who do get fined usually only have to pay £40 – five times the prescription fee. The maximum fine is just £100.

The cost of prescription fraud jumped from £47 million in 2006, to £100 million in 2008 and £216 million in 2013, according to NHS figures.

Some 900 million prescription items were given out for free on the NHS in England last year – 90 per cent of the total. Some 25 million of those were claimed fraudulently.

A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘Fraud against the NHS can have a serious impact on our ability to deliver high quality health services. We expect all appropriate sanctions and recovery action to take place.’
