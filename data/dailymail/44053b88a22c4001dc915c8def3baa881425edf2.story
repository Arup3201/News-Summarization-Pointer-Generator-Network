One month ago, Manchester City languished eight points behind Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League and appeared to be on the point of Champions League elimination.

Some supporters might have wondered about the future of their likeable coach Manuel Pellegrini.

Fast forward, however, and Sergio Aguero’s last-minute winner against Bayern Munich is beginning to resemble the season-defining moment many suspected it might be.

Manchester City players celebrate as they move level on points with Chelsea at the top of the table

A routine 3-0 victory against Crystal Palace on Saturday — achieved without a recognised striker — was ominous in its simplicity and City now sit level on points with Chelsea at the top of the table.

Pellegrini was pithy in his assessment, saying: ‘I know three weeks ago we were many points behind, close to elimination in the Champions League and we were a team that depends on Sergio Aguero. So maybe this is a miracle. But the miracle has a name — and that is work.’

The modern City do not disappear quietly. Ask Brendan Rodgers, whose Liverpool team were nine points clear of City with four weeks left of the last campaign. ‘We’re Man City, we fight till the end,’ was the defiant chant at the Etihad Stadium.

City have been wearing their ambush paint again in recent weeks and this time it is Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea who must concentrate their formidable energies on keeping their noses in front. It will not be easy, with City on a run of eight victories, six in the Premier League.

It is a streak that features four consecutive clean sheets — mostly without Vincent Kompany, Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. On Saturday, the goalscoring mantle was taken up by David Silva.

With James Milner as the frontman, the Spaniard was typically graceful, conducting the attack with Samir Nasri. The two have struck up a fantastic understanding and, at times, looked to be operating on their own clock.

Yaya Toure completed the rout with his side's third goal from a thunderous strike late in the game

Chilean manager Pellegrini insisted his side's revival this season is the result of hard work 

Palace, it should be said, were limited in the extreme and it is now only one victory in 11 league games for Neil Warnock’s side. They are trying to strengthen at the back and have offered £2.5million for Lille and Senegal left back Pape Souare.

It helps City to have Milner, that Swiss army knife of a footballer who produces accomplished displays wherever he is asked to perform. ‘He is a complete player’ was Silva’s glowing verdict on Milner, who laid on the pass for Yaya Toure to seal the victory.

Silva is sure Chelsea will be tested at Stoke this evening and also in imminent visits to Southampton and Tottenham.

A defeat for Mourinho’s team tonight would see City overtake them and grab first place for Christmas. ‘It will be a tough game for Chelsea,’ added Silva. With fixtures against West Brom, Burnley and Sunderland on the horizon, there is optimism in East Manchester that the pendulum is swinging City’s way.
