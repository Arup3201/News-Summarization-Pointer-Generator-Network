An historic bill was passed by the Norwegian parliament on Tuesday extending mandatory military service to women as part of a plan to promote gender equality.

Proposition 122 L is looking to amend the Military Service and Home Guard Acts to enable women to fight in the military. 

The bill was passed in Oslo with a strong majority of 96 votes in favour of the proposition while just six votes were against. 

Women currently make up about 13 per cent of the Norwegian Armed Forces but that ratio could be set to rise

The proposition will be put to a second reading later in the term before being written into law.

According to the Norwegian government women women currently make up about 13 per cent of the Norwegian Armed Forces.

If the bill is enacted, the same military service conditions will apply to women as their male counterparts.

All medically fit women aged between 19 and 44 years will be obliged to complete at least 19 months of military service. 

During wartime women will also be subject to conscription.

Defense Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide said in a statement, 'The most suitable and most motivated will join the service, regardless of gender.'

Norway is one of the most proactive countries in the world for championing women in the work force.  

Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Finance Minister Siv Jensen are both women.

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development previously acknowledged that the Scandinavian country has the fourth highest proportion of female workers in the world (with 76.1 per cent) after Iceland, Sweden and Switzerland.
