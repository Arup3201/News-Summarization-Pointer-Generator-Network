Bayern Munich look set to smash their way to European domination over the next few years, with the club announcing record finances this week.

Not content with being among the elite on the pitch, the German champions are now among the richest off it. Munich based magazine Focus reported on Sunday that the club had enjoyed a record financial year in the last 12 months.

The report, which was later confirmed by the club itself, estimated Bayern's revenues at about £417million, with the club making a profit of around £13m.

Almost a fifth of their wealth comes from the sale of merchandise. Here, as on the pitch, Bayern lay waste to the rest of the Bundesliga. In the last year, the club sold around 1.7 million replica shirts: more than all the other Bundesliga clubs combined.

It is not just Germany they want to dominate. According to economist Christian Weber, Bayern are now 'on a financial level with the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester United'.

Unlike Madrid and United, of course, Bayern are not weighed down by crippling debts. Through a deal with insurance company Allianz, the club have even been able to pay off all the money owed for their stadium, fifteen years ahead of schedule.

The club's long-term aim remains to be the richest club in world football by the year 2020. They are, however, already the club with the best finances. That is undoubtedly the result of sensible, long term planning from the likes of Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. But it has come at a certain price. 

Bayern sacrificed their status as an entirely member-owned club over a decade ago, and have since allowed in a growing number of investors, with Allianz the latest company welcomed to the fold. The insurance provider are now pushing to be given a seat on Bayern's board alongside fellow investors adidas and Audi.

The vast majority of the club is still owned by the fans, however, and the vast majority of investment goes into the footballing side of things. Bayern's squad is worth around £450m pounds, and their wages are significantly higher than those of any other Bundesliga team.

It is an unbelievable position of economic power, and one which Bayern now plan to turn into continuous on-field success. The Munich press are delighted, and have declared the record figures the start of a potential period of Bayern dominance in Europe.

'The attack on Europe can begin' wrote Focus, while Abendzeitung and TZ agreed with Bayern's finance boss Jans-Christian Dreesen, who declared last year that Bayern are 'a major European power'.

The project to dominate Europe began with bringing in Pep Guardiola. Guardiola was not only told to win trophies, but also to give Bayern a long term footballing identity which will endure even after the Catalan has left. And the former Barcelona man receives a healthy sum of money to achieve that goal. One recent investigation from French magazine L'Équipe estimated Guardiola's salary to be around £13m, making him the highest paid manager in the world.

It remains a far cry from the Galacticos of Florentino Perez at Real Madrid. Bayern's transfer policy, while often costly, is based around creating a team in keeping with Guardiola's style, not about collecting superstars.

As laudable as that is, however, fears remain that Bayern's rude financial health is only bad news for the rest of German football. Only Borussia Dortmund are growing at the same pace, and they are still a long way away from matching Bayern's power. Other clubs such as Schalke rely heavily on one particular investor or sponsor.

There is little sign that anyone in Germany will topple Bayern at any time soon. The Reds are hoping that that will soon be true of the whole of Europe.
