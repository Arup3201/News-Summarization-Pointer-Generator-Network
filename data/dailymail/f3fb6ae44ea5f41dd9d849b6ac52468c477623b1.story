An inmate of an Israeli prison, who reportedly had connections to spy agency Mossad, hanged himself in the shower, it has been revealed.

The man, dubbed 'Prisoner X', was 'found hanging in the shower of his security cell' on December 15 2010.

He died from asphyxiation after he using a sheet tied to the bathroom window of his cell.

An Australian TV show released information that identifies Prisoner X as Australian and Israeli spy Ben Zygier

The details have come to light after Israel partly lifted a gag order on the case, releasing previously unseen court documents.

His cell in Ayalon prison was maximum 
security that had CCTV and was designed for Yigal Amir the killer of 
then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

Writer of the report, Judge Daphna Blatman Kedrai said: 'I have found evidence allegedly suggesting the fault of elements in the Israel Prison Service.

'Orders to prevent suicide were given and the elements entrusted with guarding the prisoner were aware of them. These orders were not upheld and a 'window of opportunity' was used by the deceased to commit suicide.'

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argued last week that 'overexposure of security and intelligence activity' could harm Israel's security.

He said '"We are not like all other countries.

'We are more threatened, more challenged, and therefore we have to ensure the proper activity of our security forces.'

The prisoner was known in the media as Prisoner X as his identity and reasons for his imprisonment were secret.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes that details of the case must be kept secret for Israel's security

On Tuesday the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) identified him as Ben Zygier, 34, who was a dual-citizen with the country.

The agency claimed that Zygier had been working for both Israel's spy agency Mossad and the Australian Security Intelligence Operation.

Israel has never confirmed Prisoner X's identity.

ABC reported that Zygier gave 'comprehensive detail about a number of Mossad operations, including plans for a top-secret mission in Italy that had been years in the making.'

They believe that Zygier was arrested after his connection to Australia was uncovered.

Netanyahu's office released a statement today, saying that Prisoner X' never had any connection with the security and organizational services of Australia.

'Between Israel and all its organizations and between Australia and the Australian Security services, there is excellent cooperation, full coordination and full transparency about all the subjects on the agenda.'
