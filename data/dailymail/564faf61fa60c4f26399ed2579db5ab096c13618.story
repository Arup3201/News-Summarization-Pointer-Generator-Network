The former cellmate of Tracy Lee Brannigan - who died of a heroin overdose in a Sydney prison - has broken down while giving an account of how she found the convicted drug dealer dead and slumped against a wall.

Brannigan died of an overdose while she was confined in a 'high needs' cell at Dillwynia Women's Correctional Centre after she had a 'drug party' with former prisoner Lauren Ironside - one of the women she had a lesbian relationship with in exchange for drugs.

It was found the 41-year-old died between the afternoon of February 24, 2013 and the next morning while she was in lockdown for 17 hours where prison officers and inmates had no contact.

Tracy Lee Brannigan, 41, was found dead in her prison cell last year, after overdosing on heroin during a 'drug party' in her cell, an inquiry has heard

Lauren Ironside told an inquest into Brannigan's death that she had witnessed her cellmate injecting heroin when the pair shared the high-risk cell for three weeks. Ironside said she even joined in one time.

The inquest is looking into whether Corrective Services NSW and Justice Health breached its duty of care by leaving Brannigan unsupervised

It is also looking into whether the long-term addict - who had overdosed at least three times while in custody - was given adequate treatment.

Brannigan was moved to the cell after she returned a positive reading for drugs in her system in a 'dirty urine' sample to authorities.

On the morning before her death, Ironside told Downing Centre Local Court she saw the Woollongong mother-of-three take three Rivotril pills usually used to treat epilepsy.

She said Brannigan was clearly 'off her face' for the entire day even when she returned to the cell for lockdown at 3.30pm.

Ironside also admitted she took two Rivotril pills given to her by Brannigan, but they only made her drowsy and she slept through the afternoon and evening.

But Ironside insisted she had not injected any heroin despite the fact it was found in her system the next day.

She cried as she told the court that when she awoke about 4am she saw Brannigan slumped against the wall, her head between her legs.

'I tried to give her mouth to mouth, but she was cold and stiff,' Ironside said on Wednesday.

An autopsy found fresh track marks on Brannigan's left hand and prison officers discovered syringes concealed in a shampoo bottle inside her cell.

The inquiry, held at the Downing Centre Local court, is investigating whether Ms Brannigan was given adequate care and treatment during her time at the Dillwynia Women's Correctional Centre

Women in Prisoner Advocacy Network director Kat Armstrong said Brannigan was 'obviously intoxicated' on an opiate and possibly prescription medication when she visited the afternoon before her death.

Ms Armstrong said she begged Brannigan to stop and was so concerned she 'alluded' to two prison officers that the 41-year-old was using.

But officers on duty described Brannigan's behaviour as bubbly and responsive.

It was also heard Brannigan had repeatedly refused treatment from Justice Health staff since 2010, and quit a methadone program against advice.

On Tuesday, family members and friends watched CCTV footage of Brannigan's final custodial visit the day before she died for the first time.

Ms Brannigan was seen dressed in white overalls and was closely flanked by two prison officers when she sat down and talked to a friend.

As she spoke, she could be seen gesticulating with her hands, grabbing her crotch and swinging on her chair.

'She's stoned,' muttered one family member in court.

Former cell mate Melissa Edwards fought back tears as she described her friend as 'absolutely flying'.

The court also heard drugs were exchanged at Dillwynia by throwing them over the fence inside tennis balls.

Detective Inspector James said he thought Brannigan overdosed by accident.

Leanne O'Toole, who was Acting General Manager of Dillwynia at the time of Brannigan's death, said an increase in security at the all-female centre would be draconian and inappropriate.

'(But) I would never be able to confidently say I would ever be able to stop every drug coming into that centre,' she said.

The inquest continues.
