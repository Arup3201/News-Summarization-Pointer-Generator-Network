A former public schoolboy tried to rape an ex-classmate after she let him stay the night at her university halls, the Old Bailey heard.

Archie Reed, 20, pulled off the woman’s pyjama bottoms and knickers and pounced on her while she was asleep next to him, it is said.

When she woke up, she allegedly felt Reed groping her and screamed for him to get out of her bedroom.

Former public schoolboy Archie Reed, 20, denies attempting to rape and the assault by penetration of his former class mate after they met at a pub in Warren Street in London where they drank a bottle of wine 

She had met Reed after a drinks reception hosted by top law firm Herbert Smith Freehills, and they spent the rest of the evening drinking wine at a pub in Warren Street

The woman, who was studying in London at the time, invited currency consultant Reed to stay the night as the Tube had stopped running, said prosecutor Dianne Chan.

She said Reed pulled off her clothes, molested her and tried to rape her after she had gone to sleep.

‘She awoke to find Mr Reed on top of her and facing her’, she said.

‘She said she immediately told him to get off her and get out - she didn’t want to see him again.

‘He grabbed his things and he left.

‘She then noticed how her knickers and her pyjama shorts were off her and on the floor.’

Reed then deluged the woman with texts messages and calls, trying to apologise for what had happened, jurors were told.

He sent a message after leaving her flat, saying: ‘I’m so sorry. I owe you everything, I’m so sorry.

‘Just give me a phone call to explain myself. I wasn’t doing it all I promise.’

The Old Bailey heard that the alleged victim invited Reed, pictured, back to her university accommodation as the Tube had stopped running

Reed and his alleged victim had gone to school together, at a top independent school that cannot be identified for legal reasons.

‘They met up because they wanted to catch up on their news’, said Ms Chan.

‘Their friendship was platonic, they were only friends.’

They agreed to meet on October 8 last year at the Northumberland Arms near Tottenham Court Road, and shared two bottles of wine until the early hours of the next morning.

‘She said he could stay the night, and this was not an unusual offer because she said in the past they had topped and tailed - slept together - on a sofa’, said Ms Chan.

They held hands on the 20-minute walk home, something she said was usual for her with male friends, and they stopped off for a bite to eat along the way.

At her halls of residence, she offered Reed a duvet and a pillow, but said he could get into bed with her instead of sleeping on the floor.

After the alleged attack, she called her boyfriend in ‘hysterics’ and woke up a flatmate to tell her what had happened, said Ms Chan.

‘She said I’ve just been raped by Archie’, she said.

‘She woke up to find Archie on top of her having sex with her.’

The alleged attack was reported the following day, when she went with her boyfriend to a chemist to get the morning-after pill.

Reed, after his arrest, told detectives they had kissed and ‘spooned’ in bed, and said she had encouraged him to stay for an extra bottle of wine at the pub.

He said he offered to sleep on the floor, but she said he should lie next to her

Reed also said they had got undressed in front of each other before getting into bed.

‘She moved her bottom closer to him, so he thought - to use his words - he would go for it’, said Ms Chan.

‘The Crown say it was without her consent because she was asleep when he saw the opportunity to sexually abuse her.

‘He also removed her pyjama bottoms - that was just short of him going to have sexual intercourse with her.’

The alleged victim told police of the moment she woke up to find Reed on top of her in bed.

In a statement she said: ‘I went to sleep, I think I went to sleep pretty quickly as I’d had a bit of wine.

‘I didn’t know how long I was asleep for.

‘I don’t know how much longer it was later, but I woke up and he was on top of me.

‘It was pitch black and I didn’t know what was actually happening.

‘I just panicked and said just get off me.’

The alleged victim told police that she awoke to find Reed, pictured, on top of her

She said Reed immediately moved away, as she told him to leave her bedroom.

‘He just jumped off the bed, grabbed everything on the floor, and as he was getting his stuff I said just don’t ever speak to me again’, she said.

‘Straight away I called my boyfriend, and I was trying to explain what was happening.

‘After a while on the phone, he said go and see your flatmate and make sure you are OK.’

She said she spoke to her flatmate then called her best friend from school.

She then arranged to meet her boyfriend the next day at his house.

She met Reed in the Northumberland Arms at around 9.10pm that night, having attended a drinks reception earlier in the evening.

‘He was sitting in the window’, she told the police officer, in a recorded interview played to the court.

‘I got there and he was having a pint.

‘He bought us a bottle of wine to share, and I was like get another bottle of wine and he also had a spirit and mixer.

The Old Bailey heard that the alleged victim and Reed met up for the first time in a year following a school reunion in mid-September and agreed to meet again however, the alleged victim denies flirting with Reed

‘We shared that bottle and that’s when the pub closed.’

Reed and the woman had shared a sofa after a New Year party, the court heard, but had ‘never’ been romantically linked, she told the court.

Asked if they had exchanged flirty texts prior to meeting at the pub, she replied: ‘No, not at all.’

They agreed to meet up to share stories of their gap years, having attended a school reunion a couple of weeks earlier.

She also agreed to go to a football match with Reed later in the week, but cancelled after the alleged attack.

The woman, who cannot be identified, is in the witness box screened off from Reed in the dock. 

She denied flirting with Reed by text message in the weeks running up to the alleged attack.

They had met up for the first time in a year in mid-September last year at a school reunion, and agree to meet again soon.

Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC, defending Reed, suggested the messages may have been misinterpreted by him.

‘There was flirting between the two of you’, she suggested.

‘”It was great to see you, call me let’s meet up”, and you would end communications with a number of crosses and kisses.

Sallie Bennett-Jenkins defending Reed said the content of the alleged victims' text messages 'could have been misinterpreted' by her client as she would end her communications with a number of crosses and kisses

‘Do you agree that maybe taken to be somewhat flirtatious?’

The woman replied firmly: ‘No.’

‘You were now single’, contributed Ms Bennett-Jenkins. ‘Do you think there’s a possibility your communication could have been misinterpreted?’

But she replied: ‘No they have always been like that.’

The woman told the court her boyfriend had known that Reed was allowed into her bed that night before she went to sleep.

However, in her call to police, she suggested that Reed had not been in her bed before she fell asleep.

She and Reed had slept on a sofa together when they were 14 or 15, at a house party for New Year with other friends sleeping in the same room.

She told the court she had not given any romantic signals to Reed during the evening, or on the walk back to halls of residence.

‘We walked back, it was completely normal and we were laughing and joking and stuff’, she said.

‘We were holding hands - it sounds stupid but I had always done that with lots of guy friends, holding their hands.’

She said she was woken up by ‘the feeling of something inside me’ and could see Reed’s silhouette over her.

Archie Reed, right, tried to call and text his alleged victim after the incident to explain what had happened

After kicking Reed out, she said she phoned her boyfriend then called Reed, as he had texted her begging for a chance to explain.

‘When I was on the phone, I was trying to ask what had happened and I couldn’t get a straight answer’, she said.

‘I got the impression something happened before I woke up.

‘I didn’t know how long it was between going to sleep and the time I woke up.

‘I just panicked quite a bit and started crying immediately.

‘I still had my vest on but my shorts and my knickers were both on the floor.’

She took a train to her boyfriend’s house the same day, and went to the pharmacy in the afternoon to get the morning-after pill.

‘I went to the Tesco pharmacy to get the emergency pill, and they obviously knew what had happened’, she said.

‘They obviously didn’t force me to, but they said you have the choice to call the police.’

She said her boyfriend was ‘angry’ at what had happened, but added that he was ‘really good about it’.

Her evidence continues tomorrow.  

Reed, who lives in Hammersmith, west London, denies attempted rape and assault by penetration.

The trial continues.
