A young dress designer is on the brink of international stardom after Helena Bonham Carter wore her dress in the glossy pages of Vanity Fair.

However, she nearly missed her chance because she thought the Hollywood actress' email was a scam.

Rosie Dennington, 22, was about to delete the email from the A-list star because she thought it was a fake message from an online gang attempting to drain her bank account.

Finding fame: Helena Bonham Carter wore a design by Rosie Dennington in Vanity Fair's September issue - but the young designer nearly deleted the A-lister's email because she thought it was spam

Last Christmas her father Jon, 61, secretly sent off samples of her work to the Harry Potter actress.

In May, an email pinged into Rosie’s inbox and she was about to delete it, thinking it was a so-called phishing message from crooks trying to obtain her account details by pretending to be HSBC bank. 

But then she saw it was from ‘HBC’ and when she opened it, she read an invitation from Helena who wanted her to design a dress.

Within weeks the former Cherwell Valley College student was standing in a glitzy London office with Helena twirling around in dresses she had created.

The infamous dress: In May an email pinged into Rosie's inbox and she thought it was a so-called phishing message from crooks trying to obtain her account details by pretending to be HSBC bank - but it was actually from HBC a.k.a. Helena Bonham Carter (model wears the gown Helena chose)

Lavish: The dress, known as the Bird Cage, has three layers of skirts, one of which is embroided with poetry and another strewn with petals and tiny birds

Rosie, of Eynsham, Oxfordshire, said: 'It is like a dream coming true. It is so surreal.'

Rosie, who went to Eynsham Primary School as a child, said: 'I got the email from her PA saying that Helena had seen my designs and really liked them and wanted to see more.

'When I got there I assumed it would just be her PA, but Helena was there too. People say you should never meet your idols, but she was just so lovely and supportive.

'She said "I have a shoot coming up next week, could I take your dress?" and I was trying to be cool, and said "yeah, OK"’.

'Then she mentioned it was for Vanity Fair and the top photographer Mario Testino was shooting it. It was overwhelming. 

'She just takes risks with what she wears, and doesn't care what anyone else thinks. It is a great way of expressing yourself, and I think more people should do it.

'I always wanted to dress her - she’s unique, inventive and expressive about clothing.'

Budding designer: Rosie studied fashion design at Birmingham City University and graduated with a first class degree in 2013 and is now working on her next collection. A model showcases one of her racy designs 

Risque: Rosie, whose designs are pictured on a model, says she loves that Helena takes risks with what she wears and doesn't care what anyone else thinks

Intricate designs: Rosie said having Helena wear her designs, like this one shown on a model, is like a dream coming true. 'It is so surreal'. she said

The dress, known as the Bird Cage, has three layers of skirts, one of which is embroided with poetry and another strewn with petals and tiny birds.

The designer: Rosie, 22, still lives at home with her parents and is trying to stay grounded

The pictures, taken as part of a New York photoshoot on the International Best Dressed List, is in September’s issue, which is out now.

The accompanying article describes Rosie as a ‘new favourite young designer’. While stardom beckons, Rosie is trying to stay grounded - she still lives with her father Jon, mother Elaine, 60, and brother Christopher, 29.

Rosie, who studied fashion design at Birmingham City University and graduated with a first class degree in 2013, is now creating her next collection of work, which she funded by working at the Cancer Research shop in Botley Road, Oxford.

'I would never have believed that I would be in this position before turning 23.

'I was initially quite starstruck. But when you speak to these people you find they are as interested in your work as you are in theirs.

'I believe you should dream big but it’s also backed up by a lot of hard work.'
