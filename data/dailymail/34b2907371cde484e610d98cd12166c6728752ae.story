Sonny Bill Williams’ hopes of being fit to face England at Twickenham on Saturday are in doubt as he limped off after contributing two tries towards the All Blacks’ 74-6 victory over the USA in Chicago.

The cross-code centre  was replaced in the 56th minute of the mismatch at Soldier Field with a sore hip. 

He attempted to strike an optimistic note, saying: ‘I got a bit of a cork near my hip, I’ve had it before. The doc is pretty upbeat about it.’ 

New Zealand coach Steve Hansen was satisfied with Williams’ efforts in the 12-try annihilation of the Eagles, saying: ‘It was what we expected.’

Adam Jones joked that he may set his sights on playing at fly-half after a cheeky drop-goal attempt during Cardiff Blues’ 28-24 Guinness Pro12 defeat at home to Munster on Saturday. 

In reference to his omission from the Wales squad last week, the veteran Lions prop tweeted: ‘If I can’t get picked at 3 any more, I think I’ll try to get the number 10 spot!’ 

While his shot at the posts was off target, Jones was a force in the scrum as the Blues turned the screw on their Irish visitors, only for Paddy Butler’s late try to leave Mark Hammett’s men languishing in ninth place in the table, with just one league win from seven games.

Australia survived a scare at Twickenham on Saturday before beginning their European tour with a thrilling 40-36 win over the Barbarians. 

The invitational side were ahead going into the final quarter but a raft of replacements turned the tide for the Wallabies. 

Tries by Rob Horne and Bernard Foley gave Michael Cheika’s team the edge, despite a late rally by the Barbarians which featured a try and an assist by their Australian wing Nick Cummins. 

New head coach Cheika said: ‘In attack and defence we had some good moments and some poor moments. All in all it wasn’t a bad hit-out for us.’

Saracens are targeting a clean sweep of trophies after beginning their LV= Cup campaign with a win over Harlequins at Allianz Park, according to assistant boss Joe Shaw.

Duncan Taylor, Mike Ellery and Jack Wilson scored Sarries’ tries and Quins could never get close, despite tries from Mark Lambert and Charlie Walker.

Shaw insisted: ‘Each competition is important to us from the A League up. Obviously you have to put youth in at certain stages but we want to win every game.’
