Prosecutors finished presenting their case to a jury Thursday in the corruption trial of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell and his wife, Maureen.

FBI Special Agent David Hulser was the final witness for the government. His wide-ranging testimony helped prosecutors sum up their case against the McDonnells.

Bob and Maureen McDonnell began trial in July on charges that they took more than $165,000 in gifts and loans from Jonnie Williams, the former CEO of dietary supplements maker Star Scientific Inc., in exchange for helping promote his company's products.

They also were accused of falsifying financial documents, and Maureen McDonnell was charged with obstructing the federal investigation.

Hulser told the court that Williams spent more than $36,000 entertaining the McDonnells at a Cape Cod resort in 2012.

the weekend tab included more than $9,000 for food and beverages, including 16 servings of Louis XIII cognac totaling $2,400.

Financial records showed that former Star Scientific CEO covered all the expenses for the McDonnells and three other guests.

The ex-governor, once a rising star in the Republican Party who was widely considered a possible Mitt Romney running mate in 2012, has vigorously denied any wrongdoing and vowed to fight charges that he claimed were politically motivated.

He claims prosecutors improperly stretched the definition of bribery to cover long-accepted political courtesies like hosting receptions and arranging meetings for constituents with government officials.

The trial so far has produced many embarrassing details of the cozy relationship with Williams that destroyed McDonnell's political future.

Williams said he lavished the McDonnells with gifts including Oscar de la Renta dresses; Louis Vuitton shoes;, a $6,500 Rolex watch; golf outings; vacations and $15,000 to cover catering expenses for a daughter's wedding.

He also made three loans totaling $120,000 as the McDonnells struggled with debts related to two family-owned vacation rental properties in Virginia Beach.

All the while, Williams was seeking help from Virginia government officials. The McDonnells attended conferences to promote Star Scientific products and hosted an event for the company at the Executive Mansion, prosecutors showed, and the governor's office arranged a meeting between Williams and the state's top health official to discuss the health benefits of the products.

The trial has been especially embarrassing for Maureen McDonnell, who was portrayed in an unfavorable light by several former aides.

A onetime chief of staff to Virginia's former first lady testified that she told investigators Maureen McDonnell was 'a nutbag.'

McDonnell's former political adviser, Phil Cox, testified that in 2012, Williams and Maureen McDonnell tried unsuccessfully to get a meeting with GOP presidential candidate Romney to pitch Star Scientific's signature product, the anti-inflammatory Anatabloc.

Having failed to get an audience with the candidate, Maureen McDonnell cornered his wife, Ann Romney, on a campaign bus and began telling her how Anatabloc could cure her multiple sclerosis, Cox testified.

'I was horrified,' Cox said. 'I didn't think it sort of showed the governor in a great light.'

The defense is set to begin presenting its case Monday, and Bob McDonnell is expected to testify at some point during the trial.

In court papers, his attorneys argued that everything he did was consistent with a governor's mission of supporting state-based businesses and that Williams did not receive any state grants or other tangible benefits.Lawyers for the McDonnells have contended that the couple could not have been conspiring with Williams, because their marriage was crumbling and they were not on speaking terms.

During the trial, the McDonnells have come to court separately and have avoided looking at each other in court. An attorney for the first lady says she had a 'crush' on Williams.

But prosecutors have produced photos showing the Republican governor and his wife embracing and smiling. Former staff members have said they appeared to be a loving couple.

Maureen McDonnell is not expected to take the stand. If the McDonnells are convicted, they could each face prison sentences of 20 years and heavy fines.
