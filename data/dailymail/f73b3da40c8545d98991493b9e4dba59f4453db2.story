A luxury £60,000 Maserati car crashed into a packed London pub that is aptly called The Plough.

Shocked drinkers watched as the sports car smashed into a blue Mercedes before careering into the front window of the popular bar on St John’s Hill.

Three people suffered minor injuries when the cars crashed into the smoking area of the pub, which is near Clapham Junction station, on Friday night.

Officers surrounded the pub - closing the road for two hours. Three people received minor injuries in the smash

Pictures from the scene show Maserati smashed in to the side of the building - with the front part of the vehicle crushed beyond recognition.

Others show the bright blue Mercedes with the front end of the car in a state of total disrepair.

Plough manager, John Suntram, said: 'For anyone out there it would have been very scary.

'Amazingly, everyone was okay and just a little shaken up.

'The window was made of safety glass so the car didn’t actually break through it but both cars were written off.'

Police were called out to the incident at 8.10pm and the road was closed for two hours.

The other vehicle involved in the crash - this blue Mercedes - was in a total state of disrepair following the smash

Fire engines could be seen outside the pub for a number of hours, it is thought.

A spokesperson for The Metropolitan Police said: ‘There were three walking wounded and only minor injuries were suffered, with cuts and bruises.

‘We are investigating the cause of the accident and so far no arrests have been made.’

According to its website, The Plough is an American-inspired bar that serves a host of international craft beers, an extensive cocktail menu and a selection of meals and snacks.
