A university science lecturer has stripped off her lab coat to be crowned a national champion of pole dancing.

Forensic scientist Amy Cowles, 30, from Abbey Hulton, Staffs. took up the hobby five years ago and says pole dancing has changed her life. 

The previously shy and reserved self-confessed 'science-geek' said the activity gave her the confidence to come out of her shell.

Champion pole dancer Amy Cowles stripped off her lab coat to be crowned at Miss Pole Dance UK

Now the flexible teacher feels quite comfortable gyrating around a pole in front of hundreds of people at competitions across the UK. 

Last month the lecturer at Keele University scooped first place to win at Miss Pole Dance UK in Capel, Surrey.

She took the Semi Pro instructor category and has now set her sights on the professional title at the British championships next month.

Amy said: 'I get an amazing buzz from pole dancing. 

'I have seen big changes in my life since I started. I am much more confident around people.

'I have never been in as good a shape as I am now. I'm so much more toned than I used to be and feel far healthier.

She says the sport gave her the confidence to come out of her shell

'And then mentally it is really positive too. Socially I have seen a difference.

'I am far more outgoing now than I used to be, both because of the physical aspects of it but also from all the friends I have made there. It's like a second home.

'I was definitely more shy before I started this. I was kind of seen as a bit of a geek because I was doing science, and while I did try to have a social life, I had to work really hard too.

'I became a lab assistant at Keele University after that, and then did a teaching qualification so I am a teaching fellow there now.

'It's a complete polar opposite to the pole dancing, but it's nice to have two completely different jobs because I get different things out of both of them.

'People used to see me as geeky, not that it bothered me, but the pole dancing let's people see me in a different light.'

Amy first joined the British Pole Dance Academy, at a studio in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., in 2009.

She has now started teaching her favourite past-time at the academy as well. 

Amy added: 'I tried all sorts of sports but the difference with pole-dancing was I'd found something that interests me, that's got so many different elements to it.

'I was a bit nervous because I'd never done anything like it before.

'I wasn't particularly fit or strong and I was worried I wouldn't be able to do anything and everyone else would be great.'

Amy's potential was soon spotted by academy owner Deb Riley, herself a former British champion. 

She started entering competitions soon after, culminating in her winning the Semi Pro Instructor category at Miss Pole Dance UK, picking up the 'best tricks' category along the way.

Amy won the judges over after performing a five minute routine with a gold-digger theme based on Madonna's Material Girl.

Amy, who lives with her long-term boyfriend, Chris Cooper, 33, said: 'I try to make the costumes myself, I really enjoy it. I buy what I need and then I bling it up.

'I was always quite a girly girl anyway. I love all the outfits, doing my hair and make-up, the eyelashes, the nails, sticking on glitter.

'It's a great excuse to get yourself really done up.

'There were a few people used to say 'oh, I didn't know you did that', but mainly it was 'good for you, doing something you like'.

'It's so normal now I don't even think about it. I'm proud I pole dance and proud to say I pole dance.'

Amy will attempt to win the overall professional Miss Pole Dance UK title in Sussex on On October 4. 

She added: 'I don't have a grand masterplan, I just do it because I enjoy it. Just being up on stage is a massive achievement for me.

'Whatever else happens is a bonus.'

She now hopes to win the overall professional Miss Pole Dance UK title in Sussex on On October 4
