Darrick Guider, 39, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is accused of having sex with a 10-year-old girl and getting her pregnant

A man has been charged after he allegedly raped a young girl on multiple occasions, ultimately getting her pregnant.

Darrick Guider, 39, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is accused of having sex with a 10-year-old girl after she moved into the home he was staying at with her grandmother, who was his girlfriend.

The young girl said that the first time it happened she was watching television when Guider walked into the room and told her 'this is how you make money.'  

According to NBC 13 the girl then said in court documents she tried to scream for her grandmother, but Guider covered her mouth.

This happened shortly after she had moved to the home around June 2014.

The young girl finally told her grandmother that Guider had been 'messing with her' in December, but the woman did not believe her. 

Then, in January, the grandmother took the young girl to the pediatrician, who told her she needed to take the girl to the hospital, which the grandmother did not do for reasons that are not known at this time.

Finally, in March, the girl's mother realized she looked pregnant and took her to the hospital where it was revealed she was due at the end of May.

Abortion is illegal in Wisconsin after 24 weeks, even in instances of rape. 

Guider has been charged with first-degree sexual assault of a child under the age of 12 and faces up to 60 years in prison if convicted.
