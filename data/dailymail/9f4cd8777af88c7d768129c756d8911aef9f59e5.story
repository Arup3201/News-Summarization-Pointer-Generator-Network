A person claiming to be accused Tinder murderer Gable Tostee has taken to a bodybuilding forum to give dating tips.

The 28-year-old was charged with the murder of New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright who fell 14 storeys from his Gold Coast apartment last year.

Under the username 'G T', they responded to the forum post created by another user who was seeking advice on how to get an older women.

The man asks for help to come up with a response after  the women's last message to him was: 'You are a cutie but what can you offer me at your age?' through the online dating site Plenty of Fish.

'I have been trying to come up with a response, but her "cutie" remark has me feeling negged [sic],' the man wrote on the forum.

'For 39 years old (Probably 2-3 years older). I think she is a solid 7-7.5 [out of 10].'

In response to the post,  'G T' suggests the man should say to the women: 'I can do things to you that will make you feel 21.'

Under the username of 'G T', a person on a bodybuilding forum has posted a dating tip in response to a thread

Gable Tostee was charged with the murder of New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright who fell 14 storeys

This isn't the first time ' G T' has reached out on the bodybuilding forum.

Tostee was released under strict bail conditions  to live with his parents in Carrara, keep off Tinder and Facebook, not allowed to drink alcohol and adhere to a nightly curfew.

It comes just over a month after a person who claimed they were Tostee took to the bodybuilding forum to defend the 28-year-old over the death of Wright after they met on online dating app Tinder.

Under the username of 'G T', the person defended Tostee, saying there have been many 'misconceptions and untruths' that have been circulating in the media and the public about his involvement.

They also posted several pictures claiming to be from inside Tostee's apartment. 

One of the photographs show a tanning machine he owns on the Avalon Apartments balcony on Orchid Avenue, which has spectacular views over Surfers Paradise.

GT added he had been left distraught after Ms Wright's death and believed his silence on the topic had done more harm than good.

Ms Wright was a bank clerk and had travelled to Australia for a friend's wedding when she died

'Knowing I was the last person to be with her, it has left me permanently scarred and not a day passes that I don't wish I could go back in time and prevent it,' GT wrote.

'For at least a week after it happened I was so overwhelmed I was unable to laugh or even crack a smile. 

'I broke down in tears several times a day, or whenever I saw her picture in the news. 

'Even though I had only known her for a night I was horrified that this had happened to her. I would never wish for it to happen to anybody.'

GT said he sympathised with Ms Wright's family and it pained him to think of them.

'While I have not had the chance to meet or speak to Warriena's family, it pains me to think of the loss and suffering they must be experiencing,' he wrote.

Along with the posts, GT posted photos of what is believed to be Tostee's balcony overlooking Surfers Paradise

Tostee's case is set to be mentioned in January after he was released on strict bail conditions in November

GT also slammed news outlets for the coverage of the case, describing it as 'disgraceful'.

'They have no respect for the dignity of the people involved,' he said.

'A young woman had died and they needed a villain. My silence only fuelled peoples' imagination, and the media did everything they could to exploit that, including lying and misleading.

'They did everything they could to establish me as an evil monster, a portrayal which could not be further from the truth.' 

Tostee has always maintained his innocence in Wright's death and was released from custody in November

Queensland police have told news.com.au they knew of the post's existence and were looking to confirm if it was in fact Tostee.

But Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said: 'It does not appear to be a breach of any bail condition.'  

If GT is in fact Tostee, this would not be the first time he has reached out on social media.

During his time in custody, the 28-year-old posted a message to family and friends on Facebook - including an address for them to post letters to him.

'To all my friends and those who have been supporting me, I want to thank you and say that I miss you all,' he wrote from jail.

'I have been in custody for almost a month now for a crime I did not commit and have lost contact with almost everyone.

'I maintain my absolute innocence and hope that this nightmare will be over soon.' 

Queensland police say this post would not breach his bail conditions imposed by the court

If GT is in fact Tostee, it is not the first time he has used social media to maintain his innocence

Tostee appeared in court on the Gold Coast on January 12 and applied for a committal mention to be adjourned to March 13. 

On the night of August 8, Tostee allegedly made an audio recording during the time he spent with Wright leading up to her death.

Police alleged the three-hour file allegedly revealed the pair partook in drunk and violent sexual acts before he locked her on the balcony outside.

It is alleged that the Gold Coast man then ordered a pizza within an hour of her death. 

The recording also includes audio from a phone conversation between Tostee and his father, believed to have been made just after Wright fell 14 storeys to her death. 

Tostee was arrested after police obtained the recordings on August 15. 

Tostee's murder trial is unlikely to proceed before late 2016 to early 2017.
