'Security breach': BBC's political editor Nick Robinson lost his phone while watching football in Manchester

As the BBC’s political editor, he has the phone numbers of senior politicians at his fingertips. Well, most of the time...

During an unfortunate incident as he attended a football match, Nick Robinson lost his mobile phone containing personal contacts for everyone from the Prime Minister down.

Mobile numbers for ‘most of the Cabinet’, Downing Street officials and key civil servants were stored on the phone, sources said.

Now the loss of the treasure trove of government contacts is being treated as a ‘serious security breach’ by No.10.

It is also being investigated by the data watchdog the Information Commissioner, it is understood.

Robinson, 50, is a lifelong Manchester United fan and was off-duty to watch a football match at Old Trafford when his phone disappeared. It is unclear if it was mislaid or stolen.

But fears it could end up in the wrong hands sparked a security scare after the journalist reported it was missing.

Last night Robinson confirmed the loss, but played it down, telling the Mail: ‘It was weeks ago and it’s all over.’

A BBC spokesman added: ‘When Nick Robinson lost his mobile phone some weeks ago he informed some of his contacts out of courtesy. The BBC takes its data protection duties seriously and as a precaution the Information Commissioner was also informed.

‘There is no evidence that any of the data on the phone has been accessed or compromised. The Information Commissioner has since told us that he believes the BBC took the appropriate action.’

Robinson is accustomed to keeping his mobile phone with him wherever he goes, often taking and making calls moments before going live in Downing Street to confirm a breaking political news story.

But this is not the first time he has been embarrassed by one of his mobile devices.

Earlier this year during a heated TV debate reviewing Prime Minister’s Questions, the discussion was interrupted by the soundtrack of Fat Bottomed Girls, by rock band Queen, suddenly coming from Robinson’s tablet computer.

And in January, he revealed how his wife Pippa had lost her phone too, when he tweeted: ‘Three cheers for the cabbie who found my wife’s mobile in his cab, charged it up and brought it back! Restores your faith...’

Born in Macclesfield, Robinson became a committed Manchester United supporter as a paper boy when he discovered former United star Stan Pearson was on his round.

And last year he caused a stir by declaring the club’s outgoing manager Sir Alex Ferguson as the ‘greatest living Briton’.

He made the remark on Radio 4’s Today programme whilst ‘slightly distracted’ from his analysis of the Queen’s Speech by speculation around Sir Alex’s retirement.

Hard-hitting Robinson, who is married with three children and lives in North London, is one of the nation’s most trusted broadcasters.

The BBC’s political editor since 2005, he has made the role his own and boasts more viewers and listeners than any of his rivals in the Westminster lobby.

He rises early to broadcast on the Today programme and is still going by the time of the BBC News at 10pm. He also files regular updates from Westminster on his blog, via Twitter and the BBC’s 24-hour news channel.

Last night a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘There is no comment because it is a security issue.’ The Information Commissioner also declined to comment.
