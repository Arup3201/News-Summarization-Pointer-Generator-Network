A white supremacist who appeared in court with a swastika carved into his forehead died after a suicide attempt in prison.

Keith Luke, 28, was found unresponsive by corrections officers in his cell on Saturday, the Brockton Enterprise reported.

Luke was taken to University of Massachusetts Hospital in Worcester and placed on life support but was pronounced dead on Monday shortly after midday.

Luke appeared in court in May 2009 with a swastika carved into his forehead. The white supremacist committed suicide in prison this weekend

The cause of death was not released but a source told The Brockton Enterprise that Luke committed suicide.

Luke
 was sentenced to life in prison last May for the murders of 20-year-old woman Selma Goncalves and 72-year-old Arlindo Goncalves, along with the brutal rape and attempted murder of a second woman.

The neo-nazi had previously attempted 
suicide three other times, the Enterprise reports. He overdosed in his jail cell twice and 
received surgery for a self-inflicted throat wound in April 2010.

He had also carved a swastika into his forehead with a staple.

Luke gunned down Selma 
Goncalves, 20, and Arlindo Goncalves, 72, who are not related, and shot another woman five times after he had brutally raped her
