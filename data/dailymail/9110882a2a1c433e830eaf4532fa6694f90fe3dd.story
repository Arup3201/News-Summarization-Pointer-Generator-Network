Chandler Jones, defensive end for the NFL's New England Patriots, wants to put the sibling rivalry he enjoyed growing up with his older brother Jon to good use, and stage an exhibition fight for charity. 

It's worth noting, though, that Jon is UFC's current world light-heavyweight champion and boasts 21 wins from 22 matches in mixed martial arts. 

Undeterred, Chandler told TMZ Sports, 'Me and my brother used to fight all the time when we were young ... and I'm pretty sure I can take him down now. I am way bigger than he is.'

He went on, 'It will be fun if we actually did a one-round match for charity ... that would be fun. If I win, he would have to donate to the charity of my choice and vice versa.' 

When Jon won his UFC title in 2011, he became the youngest champion in the sport's history and in August last year was ranked No 1 its pound-for-pound rankings. 

But Chandler reckons his brother could be easily dispatched.  'I would just throw him to the ground,' he said. 

Although the Superbowl winner did concede that Patriots' backroom staff might not be happy if the fight went ahead, 'I don't know how my coach would feel about it. I don't think it would fly.'
