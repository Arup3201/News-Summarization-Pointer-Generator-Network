Rebekah Brooks acquired a retired police horse specifically for David Cameron to ride it, it was claimed today.

The tale of Raisa – and whether or not the Prime Minister had ever ridden her – became one of the most bizarre episodes from the fallout of the hacking scandal.

Now the Met Police boss who agreed to provide the horse to Mrs Brooks has claimed she boasted Mr Cameron would be climbing into the saddle, even before she had taken delivery of the animal.

Former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie were loaned a Met Police horse named Raisa in 2008

It emerged in spring 2012 that Mrs Brooks, the former Sun and News of the World editor, had been lent the 24-year-old retired Met horse between 2008 and 2010. The deal was struck after Mrs Brooks Dick Fedorcio – the Met’s then-head of public affairs.

According to a new book, Mrs Brooks suggested Mr Cameron would be riding the horse while she was in talks with the Met about looking after the retired beast.

Alan Hiscox, the head of Imber Court, the Met’s horse training centre, said he was told by his bosses that it would ‘definitely be a good idea for the Met Police’ to loan a horse to Mrs Brooks, according to The News Machine’ by James Hanning with Glenn Mulcaire, serialised in The Independent today.

In October 2007, Mr Hiscox to the Cotswolds to check out the stables and facilities at the Brooks’ home.

Mr Hiscox said: ‘As we were being shown round the stables, she told me that David Cameron would also be riding the retired police horse.

After several days of trying to dodge the question, in 2012 David Cameron finally admitted that he had indeed ridden Raisa

‘At the time I did not think much of it, other than to wonder why she told me that. She may have been trying to show off, but it was a curious thing to say.’

Questions about the horse, and whether Mr Cameron had ridden it, emerged when the spotlight fell on the nature of close relationships between journalists, the police and politicians.

In late February 2012 Mr Cameron’s official spokesman initially insisted: ‘The only horses I am interested in are the type you can put a bet on. He has never been in a race in which I can back a horse.’

Two days later the Prime Minister had to cut off from a Brussels summit to answer questions about the horse. He told reporters that Raisa was among his mounts when he rode with Mrs Brooks’ husband Charlie, a friend since they attended Eton.

‘I have not been riding with him since the election,’ said Mr Cameron. ‘Before the election, yes, I did go riding with him.

‘He has a number of horses and, yes, one of them was this former police horse Raisa which I did ride.’

According to the book, Mr Hiscox added: ‘Why did David Cameron’s office not say he had ridden the horse in the first instance?

‘It wasn’t clear to me why they were so embarrassed about it.

‘It is possible, I suppose, that Rebekah Brooks was trying to ingratiate herself with Mr Cameron and that she had told him she was going to get it for him, but in normal circumstances it should not have been a big deal.’

In 2010 the horse was returned to the Met Police, where it later died. Mr Hiscox added: ‘Clearly it had not been ridden or groomed much, but there was no suggestion by me that it had been mistreated, as was claimed in the press.’

Last month Mr and Mrs Brooks were cleared of all charges in relation to phone hacking and perverting the course of justice.
