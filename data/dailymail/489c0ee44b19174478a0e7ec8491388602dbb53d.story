Spanx may have become a modern byword for figure-flattering undergarments - but as far as the A-list are concerned, there's a new line of shapewear whittling bodies down to red carpet size.

According
to the creator of dMondaine, celebrities including Sofia Vergara, Halle
Barry, Ginnifer Goodwin, Fergie and Kelly Osbourne are all shunning the
market leader in favor of her new, more luxurious alternative that uses
couture techniques to shape the body.

Founder and designer, Kiana Anvaripour, tells MailOnline that the A-list demand is thanks to LA's celebrity stylists.

'Here in Los Angeles where we are 
based, dMondaine has become an essential tool with all the major 
stylists dressing stars for the red carpet,' she said.

Indeed,
Anita Patrickson, who dresses Emma Watson, Julianne Hough and
Bond girl Berenice Marlohe, is one of that number.

She told InStyle.com: 'They’re sexy. They cover all problem areas and add an extra layer of confidence when they’re on the red carpet.'

Ms
Anvaripour says the secret to her success is that her designs not only 
look good, but shape the body and feel comfortable enough to wear all 
day long - something that she felt didn't already exist in the 
marketplace.

'There were pieces that had gussets, scooped out busts to 
allow for your own bra – and numerous images of black bras with a nude 
bicycle short and suspenders on top,' she recalled. 'How can that be sexy when you undress?'

Nor are they typically 
comfortable: 'I often hear stories of women wearing shapewear they feel 
incredibly self conscious in, and have ended up taking it off during an 
evening out to make themselves feel better,' she added.

Ms Anvaripour says her goal was 'about
designing something that gave you 
an instant va-va-voom bombshell factor'. She says she uses 'couture 
techniques that I learned working in London's biggest fashion houses to 
ensure that the items create form and not just flatten. . . Most shapewear out there 
flattens your best bits!'

What's more, each undergarment is intended to look attractive with or without clothes.

'When you catch a glimpse of yourself in 
the mirror I want you to like what you see,' she says.

And
it seems the appeal of dMondaine has gone beyond the A-list. Already, 
Ms Anvaripour's shapewear is being stocked by Neiman Marcus, Barneys and Net-a-porter.com - and customers can't get enough.

The Jane bra, a feature of several items in the dMondaine range, has
been nicknamed 'the boob job in a bra' by fans. It was sported by 
Nicole Scherzinger throughout her latest tour, and has even become an 
unlikely hit among nursing mothers.

'It truly shocks them because not only are they feeling sexy and shaped 
without a wire, but they are able to wear the bra even after they have 
finished nursing and back to their original size,' the designer says.

The Lana high-waisted brief has also won enthusiastic responses.

'Recently
I woke up to an email from a 
major UK retailer asking for a special order of 60 of our Lana 
high-waisted brief,' she said. 'The order was for a customer who had 
tried the Lana and 
fell in love with them so much that she ordered 60 for herself!'

Under where? Ms Anvaripour says some women want to wear the Marilyn slip as outerwear

Ms Anvaripour says that 
while her customer is typically younger, she has fans in their late 
seventies. It is unlikely that the septugenarians are those embracing 
the dMondaine as outerwear though.

'Some women want to wear the Marilyn Contouring Slip 
out on its own with nothing over the top, and many have!'

As for herself, the designer says she lives in the bras and bodysuits, particularly 'for sheer blouses I 
can't button up fully and to feel confident in jeans when my pesky 
muffin top is showing!'

Putting it to the test: FEMAIL was curious to know if dMondaine could genuinely deliver something new to shapewear fans

At 5ft 4in and a U.S. size 6, I
can usually benefit from shapewear beneath my more body-conscious 
clothes. Spanx is my go-to, but I was curious to know if dMondaine could
genuinely deliver something new to shapewear fans, who are inundated 
with a new 'miracle' product on an almost daily basis. 

I
was sent the Marilyn - dMondaine's signature piece - to road-test. It 
is a full-body garment that looks like a rather short, tight, 
cleavage-baring minidress.

Getting
into it was straightforward. It has a zip at the back, and once I'd 
wiggled it up, my less-than-toned midriff instantly looked more 
streamlined.

My
concern, though, was the built-in bra, usually something I avoid as I 
usually require more serious support. But Kiana says that the dMondaine 
designs fit every size, and can be worn by anyone with or without a bra.
In the interests of research, I initially tried the Marilyn without. 
But while it definitely had a 'boob job effect', I felt too unsupported 
to go without a bra, so ended up wearing it as well as the slip.

My
clingy leather/wool pencil skirt, I felt, would be the toughest 
challenge for the dMondaine - it is gorgeous, but unforgiving on my 
gym-phobic body. Perhaps this would be the key to making it more of a 
wardrobe staple.

The result?
The usually tight skirt was verging on loose - I was astonished. I felt
like I'd lost a couple of inches from my waistline. Result!

In
terms of comfort, the dMondaine fared well too. It's not as comfortable
as wearing no shapewear at all, but distinctly more forgiving than any 
other shapewear I've worn. That first day I wore it through several 
meetings and an awards do - it didn't feel restrictive after eating and I
wasn't itching to take it off at the end of the night.

The
verdict? I loved the dMondaine, but it's pricey at $169. The closest 
Spanx equivalent is the Slimplicity open-bust full slip, at $88. If 
you're prepared to splash out though, it's worth every penny.
