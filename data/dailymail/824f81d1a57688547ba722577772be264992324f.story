A disgruntled woman is selling her ex-husband's Porsche for a measly $20,000 as payback for him cheating on her so she can have her own fun with men on a European jaunt.

The jilted woman from Templestowe, in Melbourne's northeast, placed an advertisement titled - Ex-husbands precious Porsche 911 - on the Revenge Sales website with the justification behind her vindictive plan.

'I have been married to this unfaithful poor excuse for a human being for over 25 years and yes we are wealthy,' she firstly pointed out about the 2010 Carrera 997 model that is worth about $150,000.

The daring woman then went onto explain how she discovered her man, that she had committed to for quarter of a century, was doing the dirty.

'I had hunches that my husband was cheating so I followed him out on what he said was a 'guys poker night' to find him at a 5 star restaurant cuddling up to this young blonde woman (cliché),' the ad says.

'So to pay him back, as I have rightful ownership of his precious Porsche, I have decided to sell it for a specific price of $20,000.'

And she ends the post with the clincher on how she plans to spend the money. 

'I figured $20,000 is just enough for a return flight/accommodation to Europe so I can fondle with all the wealthy European men!'

The advertisement naturally caused some colourful responses from interested buyers of both the sports car and its female owner. 

'It's a bit of a ride from the east coast of the USA, but if your offer is legit, I'll be happy to make the trip, respect and pay your $20K asking price, and take you to dinner,' Greg posted.

'ill [sic] come pick it up now and ill take you too if you want but seriously ill come buy it now,' Jayden said. 

The lucky woman already has a place to stay in France on her European trip 

'I'm happy to give you $20000 in cash and a free accommodation in Paris, Amath offered.

The ballsy move of the woman was praised by some on the revenge sales site who could empathise after going through a similar experience.

'YOU GO GIRL!!!:)YOU KICK HIS ASS.YOU ARE WOMAN,.......WE HEAR YOU ROAR;)' Ash said.

'Good on you. This would make a great present for myself as my wife I found out has been doing the same. Think I need to treat myself. Please email me,' Damien said.  

'I am not rich but also went through the exact same thing with my first husband who was cheating on me with any woman that would give him the time of day,' Karen posted.

'What I can never figure out is why these men get married to be in a committed relationship if they do not plan on staying committed.

'I applaud you for hitting him where it hurts the most, which is his wallet! I wish you all the best, and the sooner you get away from this two timer, the better your life will be!!!!! :)' 

The ad attracted some responses by people asking out the woman while others empathised with her situation

While there were others who doubted the post was a legitimate advertisement.

'More like a bogus ad to draw crowds to this site. Try finding another Porsche or Mercedes or anything on here lol why wouldn't this be on carsales and why doesn't it have KM's or a rego plate? Surely with the unbelievable low k's it should still have number plates,' one person questioned.

'I see you removed the plates for the photos, you must know what you are doing.... I call BS on this, so many things don't add up,' Jacques says.

'Is this for real??? I suppose that you have had a heap of people chasing this up but keen to learn more,' David said.

'I walked in on my now ex wife "on the job" so to speak.'

While another doubter aptly called 'Really' with the following reply.

'ya'll still think this is real / even if it was the car has been sold. STOP DREAMING! LOL.'

While other people even doubted that the post was a legitimate advertisement on the Revenge Sales website
