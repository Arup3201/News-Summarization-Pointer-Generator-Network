The strain placed on the NHS by patients from abroad is revealed by figures showing that around half a million immigrants sign up at GP surgeries every year.

The startling finding has come from independent research because the Government has failed to look into the impact of immigration on the health system.

Adding to the demand on the NHS, many GP surgeries lead new arrivals to believe that all health care is free – even though temporary migrants should pay for expensive hospital care, unless it is an emergency.

More and more patients are having to wait longer for an appointment with their GP as half a million immigrants sign up to GP surgeries

While doctors struggle with groaning workloads, they are reluctant to talk about immigration and often downplay the issue.

But with more patients sometimes waiting weeks for an appointment with their GP, the issue has begun to move up the political agenda.

On Thursday, Tory Chief Whip Michael Gove became the latest politician to voice concerns.

He told the BBC’s Question Time audience that ‘the rate and pace of immigration’ was creating particular pressures, including those ‘on access to GPs and hospitals’.

Experts do not know how many immigrants registering at GPs come from within the EU, but it is estimated they account for about 40 per cent, or 200,000 each year.

Despite growing worries, the Department of Health has not carried out a single study into the impact of a decade’s worth of mass immigration on use of the NHS. It has only researched the sensitive issue of ‘health tourism’.

However, analysis by the highly respected Nuffield Trust think-tank has found immigration is leading to about half a million joining GPs’ books every year.

Researchers Adam Steventon and Martin Bardsley looked at the number of people aged 16 and over registering with a GP for the first time. Mr Steventon said: ‘The method is not perfect, but we identified 550,000 probable immigrants registering in the year 2003-04. This rose to 583,000 for 2004-05 and to 625,000 for 2005-06.’

In the absence of Government research, the Trust’s estimates are the most recent figures available.

However, since immigration has remained high, the pressure is continuing to grow on GP surgeries.

In the year to June 2014, 583,000 people came to live and work in the UK, according to the Office for National Statistics, and 325,000 left.

Separate figures show that the average length of GP patient lists has increased in 198 of 211 health authority areas across England since April 2013.

Dr Richard Vautrey, a member of the British Medical Association’s General Practice Committee, said that although doctors were concerned about being overwhelmed, the pressure was not down to immigrants, but the ageing population.

He said: ‘They [GPs] say they are struggling, but it’s not because of changes in the population.’

Dr Vautrey added that immigrants tended to be younger and healthier than the general population, elderly people used the NHS far more and GPs were having to carry out more work traditionally done in hospitals. However, he said migrants with poor English did tend to need longer consultations and also the use of interpreters.

Last year 42,500 women from Eastern Europe gave birth in NHS hospitals, new figures have revealed 

Births to women from Eastern European countries in the EU have leapt tenfold over the past decade at NHS hospitals.

In 2004, there were about 4,500 births in England and Wales to women from Poland and other former Eastern bloc nations that are now members of the EU.

But by 2013 that figure had risen to 42,500, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Polish women account for about half of these births, with their number rising from 1,830 a decade ago to 21,275 in 2013.

The ONS regards ‘new EU countries’ as those that have joined the European Union since the start of 2004 – Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus. Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007, and Croatia in 2013.

With the average hospital delivery costing around £1,500, the NHS’s total maternity bill may have risen by around £57 million due to immigration from these ‘new EU’ countries.

Women from these countries used to account for a tiny proportion of births in England and Wales overall – just 0.7 per cent in 2004. By 2013 that had grown to 6.1 per cent.

Over a similar period, the ratio of UK births to all foreign-born mothers rose from 19.5 per cent to 26.5 per cent – up from 124,563 in 2004 to 189,075 in 2012.

Births to UK-born women numbered 515,144 in 2004 and 540,572 in 2012.

The rises have left maternity units struggling, with the Royal College of Midwives demanding 3,200 more midwives.
