Bayern Munich fans gathered in their thousands to celebrate their team's 2-0 German Cup win against Borussia Dortmund while getting a glimpse of the double winners.

The Bayern players were presented to the fans from the Munich city hall as each squad member took his turn to raise both the Bundesliga shield and the DFB-Pokal cup.

Fans were serenaded by Bayern midfielder Thomas Muller before seeing their favourite players and boss Pep Guardiola enjoy the limelight.

Guardiola's side secured their tenth domestic double on Saturday night after the 2-0 win against Dortmund after extra-time.

Arjen Robben tapped in at the far post in the 107th minute after the country's top two teams slugged it out in a goalless but entertaining 90 minutes.

Muller then raced clear deep in stoppage time to complete the win over their bitter rivals immediately after Marco Reus had missed a chance to equalise.

Team to beat: Bayern have won the domestic double in Germany having already picked up the Bundesliga title

Former Barcelona coach Guardiola had a tough act to follow when he took over this season following Bayernâ€™s treble-winning campaign under former coach Jupp Heynckes.

'This was a very difficult year for me, my first in Germany. So four titles is good,' he said after their 2-0 Cup win over Dortmund.

Guardiola quickly led Bayern to the UEFA Super Cup and the club World Cup title when he took over before racing to the quickest ever Bundesliga title with seven games to spare.

'When a team wins the league title then it is already a good season,' Guardiola told reporters. 'But we are happy to have achieved this season. The German Cup was a big title.'
