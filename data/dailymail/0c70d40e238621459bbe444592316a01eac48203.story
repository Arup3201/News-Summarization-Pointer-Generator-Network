Hebrew graffiti thanking Adolf Hitler and denouncing Zionism have been sprayed inside Israel's own Holocaust museum in Jerusalem.

One giant slogan at the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem read: 'Thank you Hitler for your wonderful Holocaust that you arranged for us, it's only because of you that we got a state at the UN.'

It was sprayed across walls in Warsaw Ghetto Square near to a sculpture depicting the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, in which 13,000 were killed in the first uprising in Nazi occupied Europe.

survivor and former Israeli MP, looks at graffiti sprayed on the Yad Vashem memorial. It reads, 'an 
alternative holocaust memorial to the selective Yad Vashem should be 
built'

Slogans sprayed on the red-brick 
Wall of Remembrance in Warsaw Ghetto Square: One reads: 'The Zionist 
leadership wanted the Holocaust'. The other says: 'If Hitler hadn't 
existed, the Zionists would have invented him'

More graffiti was sprayed next to the cattle car memorial, which remembers how millions of Jews were transported from all over Europe to the Nazi death camps.

Other slogans read: 'The Zionist leadership wanted the Holocaust' and 'If Hitler hadn't existed, the Zionists would have invented him.'

Another said: 'The war of the Zionist regime is not the war of the Jewish people.'

That slogan fuelled suspicion that a small fringe of ultra-Orthodox Jews, who are virulently opposed to the state of Israel, were to blame.

The red, white and black graffiti was written in both formal Hebrew characters as well as in hand-written script and signed: 'The global cynical mafia.'

Investigation: Israeli policemen inspect the anti-Zionist Hebrew graffiti. A police spokesman said it was not clear who was responsible, whether it was 'youngsters, vandals or people acting from other motives'

Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld confirmed basic details of the incident, and said an investigation had been opened.

He said it was not clear who was responsible, whether it was 'youngsters, vandals or people acting from other motives.'

Yad Vashem is the main museum in Israel commemorating the six million Jews who were killed by the Nazi regime during the Second World War.
