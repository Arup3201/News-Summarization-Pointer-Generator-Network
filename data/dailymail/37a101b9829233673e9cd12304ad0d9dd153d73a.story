Stuart Hall has been charged with more historic sex attacks including the rape of a young woman and 14 counts of indecent assault on children as young as a nine.

The veteran broadcaster, 83, was arrested yesterday when he attended a Lancashire police station by appointment over allegations stretching  over a 19-year period.

The rape is alleged to have been in 1976 on a 22-year-old and the indecent assault offences are reported to have been committed between 1967 and 1986. They concern ten girls aged between nine and 16.

The 83-year-old BBC television and radio
 presenter had appeared in court earlier this month to face accusations 
of three other sex attacks.

Further charges: Stuart Hall (pictured outside court on January 7) was arrested yesterday on suspicion of rape and several indecent assaults over a 19-year period

A Lancashire Police statement said: 
‘Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service an 
83-year-old man has this evening been charged with one offence of rape 
and 14 offences of indecent assault.’

Hall had already been charged in December with indecently assaulting three girls.

These charges included an alleged 
assault of an eight-year-old, an 11-year-old and a woman who was then 
aged 16. The allegations cover the period between 1974 and 1984.

Hall, who is known for his 
distinctively highbrow approach to football commentary on Radio 5 Live, 
was released from custody and bailed to appear before court this month 
over the three charges.

But now that case will go before magistrates in 
Preston on April 16. He has already pleaded not guilty.

And, in light of the new allegations 
laid against him, he has been bailed to appear before magistrates, again
 in Preston, on February 7.

In December, Hall’s employers at BBC 
Radio 5 Live announced he would not be working for them while the police
 investigation was continuing.

Hall was first arrested in December 
during a dawn swoop on his £1.5million detached home in Wilmslow, 
Cheshire, where he lives with his wife of 44 years, Hazel, who is 74.

The couple, who have two grown-up 
children, Daniel, 50, and Francesca, 52, are popular among the local  
community where they carry out charity work.

Hall won legions of fans in the 1970s 
and 1980s for his inimitable style and habit of breaking down in fits of
 infectious laughter during It’s a Knockout.

He became an OBE in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting and charity.

Hall’s solicitor, Louise Straw, said 
last night: ‘A number of historic allegations have been made, all of 
which are denied.

'None of these allegations have been raised with the 
authorities in the last three to four decades which raises concerns and 
issues.’

A police spokesman said: ‘We take all allegations of sexual abuse extremely seriously.’

Scrum: There was huge interest as the broadcaster British broadcaster walked to court a fortnight ago

Mr Hall appeared before magistrates a fortnight ago to deny the first three allegations of sexually abusing young girls he was accused of in December.

The veteran broadcaster, who has not been seen in public since, looked drawn and grey – a shadow of his normal ebullient self – as he entered court to face three counts of indecent assault.

Hall was asked if he understood that he faced three separate charges of indecent assault and if he wanted to enter a plea.

He replied: ‘Yes I do. Not guilty to all three charges.’

Hall, who gave his full name, James Stuart Hall, was then allowed to sit down in the witness box while further details of the charges were given at Preston Magistrates’ Court.

Following his arrest Hall condemned the police decision to carry out a dawn raid at his home.

At the time his solicitor, Miss Straw, expressed anger saying her client should not have had to suffer the humiliation of being arrested at his family home in the early hours of the morning.
