Six days after a family 
of four found themselves helpless and adrift in a sailboat far into the 
Pacific with a vomiting and feverish 1-year-old aboard, a Navy warship 
delivered them safely to San Diego, where they had begun their attempted
 around-the world voyage before the child was born.

The
 Rebel Heart, the 36-foot sailboat that had been their home for seven 
years, is at the bottom of the ocean 900 miles off Mexico, sunk by the 
rescuers because it was taking on water after losing its steering and 
most of its communications.

A
 satellite phone ping from the boat Thursday set off a huge rescue 
effort that began hours later with skydiving National Guardsmen and 
involved three federal agencies, a plane, a frigate and scores of 
personnel before it was through.

Back on dry land: The Kaufman family are seen in this April 9 U.S. Navy photo deboarding the guided missile frigate USS Vandegrift after they were rescued with a sick baby nearly 2,000 miles out at sea in a sailboat

Eric and Charlotte Kaufman, with daughters, Lyra, 1, and Cora, 3, were rescued and returned to San Diego by a Navy warship

It also set off a serious debate
 over parenting, and the propriety of hitting the high seas with two 
kids young enough to be in diapers.

The ship, the USS Vandegrift, docked at Naval Air Station North Island about 10 a.m., Navy spokeswoman Lt. Lenaya Rotklein said.

In
 a photo released by the Navy, the family looked like typical 
vacationers, with father Eric dressed in shorts and a baseball cap while
 lugging bags, and his wife, Charlotte, walking behind him, holding the 
toddler in a strap-on carrier and grasping the hand of her 3-year-old 
daughter.

The happy 
scene was a far cry from the miserable conditions described by Navy 
sailors who spoke to reporters after the ship moved to the San Diego 
mainland later in the day without the Kaufmans.

It
 was scheduled to move on to the San Diego mainland later in the day but
 without the Kaufmans, who said they want to tend to their 1-year-old 
daughter, Lyra, first and get some rest before talking publicly, 
Charlotte Kaufman's sister, Sariah English, said.

The
 Kaufmans' decision to sail around the world with Lyra and her 
3-year-old sister Cora drew accusations of reckless foolishness from 
some observers and praise from others for their courageous spirit.

'They'll probably go on the 'Today' 
show to talk about this, and write a book about it, do a miniseries and 
get 15 minutes of fame because that's how our country tends to reward 
people who choose recklessly to put themselves and their children in 
danger,' said Margaret Dilloway, a San Diego novelist who has three children.

English doesn't question the decision of her sister's family. She said sailing is their passion. It's what defines them.

'Charlotte and Eric raise their children how they see fit,' English said. 'They
 are very concerned about child safety. That's their No. 1 concern, and 
they did not do this blindly. They are responsible, good parents.'

But
 they are aware of the criticism. Eric Kaufman, a Coast Guard-licensed 
captain, and his wife sent a statement from the ship defending their 
actions, saying 'when we departed on this journey more than a year ago, 
we were then and remain today confident that we prepared as well as any 
sailing crew could.'

Others 
said children benefit in many intangible ways from parents who show them
 the world, even when they're too young to remember it.

Ivan Alba said the Kaufmans should be commended.

'I
 think it's a great thing, their decision to sail around the world, and 
just because their children are 1 and 3 years old doesn't mean they 
can't be on a boat,' said Alba, of San Diego, who is also planning a 
world trip with his wife and two daughters, 8 and 10. 'It's just too bad
 what happened, but that's also life. Anything can happen, anywhere.'

Four
 California Air National Guard members parachuted to the sailboat 
Thursday and stabilized Lyra, who responded well to medication for 
Salmonella-like symptoms until the warship arrived Sunday.

She
 had previously had salmonella in Mexico, where the family had stopped 
their voyage for her birth, but her pediatrician assured them she was 
recovered and could travel, English said.

But shortly into the trip, the child started showing symptoms and did not respond to antibiotics.
