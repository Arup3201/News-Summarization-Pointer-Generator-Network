An Oregon teenager was arrested after allegedly hitting a pedestrian with her car and fleeing the scene.

Miranda Ashley Calvin, 19, was arrested by Gresham police on Sunday afternoon. 

Police were called to a Gresham road at about 8.30pm on Saturday night where they found 49-year-old Jerrie Ann Hornig dead when they arrived.

Miranda Ashley Calvin, 19, of Gresham, Oregon, was arrested on Sunday afternoon after allegedly hitting a woman with her car and fleeing the scene

The woman Calvin allegedly hit was 49-year-old Jerrie Ann Horning. When police arrived at the scene at about 8.30pm on Saturday night, she was found dead

A white Mercedes Benz had been spotted fleeing the scene and was later seen by a person who was listening to a police scanner, which led to Calvin's arrest, according to Oregon Live.  

Gresham police said that tips from the public helped lead to the teenager's arrest, who was found by police at a Marriott Hotel in Clackamas.  

Calvin was arrested and booked into Multnomah County Detention Center on manslaughter, felony hit-and-run and reckless driving. Her arraignment hearing will be later this week. 

Hornig's son Maxwell Horning posted a status on Facebook remembering his mother after the incident.

'I got the worst new of my life at 1Am last night,' he said. 'My mom was hit and killed by a hit and run driver.'

He wrote that it still feels 'unreal like being trapped in a bad dream you can't escape from but she is in a better place enjoying her new life with old friends and family'. 

He said he missed his mother 'so much already' and that he 'loved her so much', calling himself her 'number 1 son'.

He then posted a picture of his mother from when she was in high school in 1983. She appears to be wearing a cheer leading uniform.  

Gresham Police said that anyone with information about the hit-and-run should call the tip line at (503)618-2719, where callers can remain anonymous if they wish.
