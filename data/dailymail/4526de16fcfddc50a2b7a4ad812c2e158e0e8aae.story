Opera singer Eliana Pretorian outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London where she escaped the threat of jail over a contractual dispute

A young opera star has escaped the threat of jail after she was pursued through the courts by a businessman claiming a cut of her earnings.

UK-based Eliana Pretorian appeared at the Royal Courts of Justice after Romanian businessman Ion Vasile applied for her committal to prison for alleged contempt of court.

The case, which the soprano claims ‘nearly destroyed her life’,  has its origins in a deal said to have been struck between Miss Pretorian’s father and Mr Vasile in 1999, which the businessman claimed entitled him to a share of her future earnings as a singer in return for financing her music studies.

But Miss Pretorian, a soprano who regularly performs at Glyndebourne and Sadler’s Wells, said any such ‘contract’ is worthless because she was only 17 at the time.

Her barrister, Paul Stadden, attacked the deal as ‘usurious’.

Miss Pretorian’s father is said to have agreed on her behalf to pay Mr Vasile 35 per cent of her professional income – ‘earned in such ten years as he might choose’ – in return for a $6,900 (£4,400) contribution to the cost of her musical training. 

Now aged 31 and pregnant, Miss Pretorian tried to have the agreement overturned but the Romanian courts rejected her case in February 2009 and ordered her to pay Mr Vasile his legal costs.

The judgment was later formally recognised by the English courts.

Lawyers representing Mr Vasile 
applied for her committal to jail, accusing her of failing to disclose 
comprehensive details of her professional income.

But Judge Richard Seymour QC threw out the case on Wednesday, ruling that it was ‘doomed to failure’.

He said Miss Pretorian had not 
breached any undertaking to fully disclose her earnings and that she 
could not be punished ‘for failing to do something she was not obliged 
to do’.

By mid-December last year, Miss Pretorian had done all that was required of her, he said.

Judge Seymour added: ‘What was 
unexplained was why, that having happened, the decision was taken – by 
or on behalf of Mr Vasile – to pursue the application for committal.

‘It is manifest that the application to commit is wholly without merit.’

He ordered Mr Vasile, who was not in 
court, to pay £6,525 in legal costs. Outside court, mother-of-one Miss 
Pretorian said she felt the deal was ‘immoral to the root’.

She claimed she had gained little from it and achieved success through her own efforts.

It had overshadowed her ever since, 
even after she won a prestigious scholarship to study at the Royal 
College of Music, she said.

She added: ‘It nearly destroyed my life. It was never a question of him discovering me or his money being vital to my career.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
