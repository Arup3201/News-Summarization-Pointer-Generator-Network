A 15-year-old boy posted a rap video online boasting about killing a 19-year-old man just two days after he gunned him down, authorities have claimed.

After police saw the video, Tommy M. Canady was charged with first degree-intentional homicide in the death of Semar McClain, whose body was found in a backyard in Racine, Wisconsin on July 29.

McClain, who was visiting from Minnesota to attend a friend's funeral, had been shot in the head and his pockets had been emptied, according to authorities, the Racine Journal Times reported.

Two days later, Canady allegedly uploaded a rap song showing him singing: 'I'll kill a (expletive) real quick and snatch his gold.'

Accused: Fifteen-year-old Tommy Canady, pictured left in his mug shot, is accused of murdering 19-year-old Semar McClain, right, and then posting a rap video online describing how he gunned him down

Other lyrics, according to CBS58, added: 'Get Semar slipping, walking through the alley, gangly a** tried to run like an athlete but bullets catch n*****, bullets run track meets, bullet hit the n***** head and he falls to his toes, he thinks he's the s*** now he getting exposed.'

The song has since been removed from the website.

McClain had been seen discussing trading guns with Canady near a stairwell in a building on July 29, and both men were holding guns as they left the area of Jackson Street on bikes.

The older man was later found dead with a gun wound to his head in a backyard.

Investigators found that his pockets had been pulled out, suggesting he had been robbed, and they did not find any money on the body.

'Caught': Canady, pictured, allegedly uploaded the rap to his SoundCloud page two days after the death

Arrest: Canady faces life in prison if he is found guilty of first-degree murder. He is being charged as an adult

According to court documents, the rap video uploaded by Canady included the lyrics:

'Get Semar slipping, walking through the 
alley, gangly a** tried to run like an athlete but bullets catch n*****,
 bullets run track meets, bullet hit the n***** head and he falls to his
 toes, he thinks he's the s*** now he getting exposed.'

''I'll kill a (expletive) real quick and snatch his gold.'

He had been shot with a .38 caliber revolver. That weapon and a .380 caliber handgun the men were seen holding on the day of the killing were found in Canady's home during a police search.

The guns were also linked to two other shootings that day. Two teenagers, aged 15 and 16, were injured in those incidents.

After the killing, authorities acted on a tip and found the rap songs posted to Canady's SoundCloud page - as well as an image of him posing with a gun.

Racine County District Attorney Rich Chiapete called the incident 'a cold, heartless, 
heinous act.'

McClain's older sister, Semaja, a senior at Illinois Wesleyan University, attended Canady's hearing.

Afterwards, she
 said that her family is heartbroken by the loss of the teenager, who 
was working two jobs to be able to afford college in St Paul, Minnesota.

Killed: Semar McClain, pictured left and right, had been seen with Canady earlier that day and a gun he was seen carrying was allegedly found in Canady's home during a police search

Missed: Friends and relatives paid tribute to the slain teen with messages near his home

He had returned to Racine to attend the funeral of a friend who had died after an asthma attack.

'This
 is a tragedy to our family,' she said, the Journal Times reported. 
'Imagine being a big sister and getting a call from the baby asking 
"Why, why, why?"'

Canady is being held in Racine County Jail and his bond has been set at $500,000. He will face adult charges of first-degree intentional homicide and robbery. If convicted, he faces life in prison.

He will be back in court on Thursday for his preliminary hearing.
