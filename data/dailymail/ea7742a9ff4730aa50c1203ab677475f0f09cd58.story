A young woman who reached the final of a beauty contest without organisers realising she was born a boy is now determined to win the next series of Big Brother.

Pammy Rose, so called because she modelled her look on Pamela Anderson, first hit the headlines last year when she made the final of 'The Face of Sunderland'.

The 22-year-old from Seaham, County Durham, later revealed to the judges that she was born as a boy called Paul Witten.

Reality TV hopeful: Pammy Rose, 22, is ready to 'show the world who she really is'

She had entered the beauty contest because she 'wanted to promote different people'.

Now she wants to spread her message even further by starring in the next series of reality TV show Big Brother. 

Pammy Rose, who is on a waiting list for her full sex change operation, has sent a video to producers explaining her struggles in life so far and why should would make a great housemate.

She said: 'I want to win Big Brother, I am dying to get in there. I am a big fan of the show and I absolutely love reality TV. I want to be the second transgender to win Big Brother after Nadia.

'I am ready to show the world this is who I am and I am not afraid to show it.'

She is now one step closer to achieving her dream after Tweeting that she has now been invited to audition for the show.

She wrote: 'I've just received the email I've been waiting for! Looks like it's the beginning of the audition process for big brother tomorrow!' 

The TV hopeful said she can't wait to have an operation to fully change her gender.

'It feels like I have been waiting forever,' she said. 'I am a straight woman. I have always considered myself a woman but inside a man's body.'

Name change: Pammy Rose has been likened to Pamela Anderson - which is why she chose her moniker

Born Paul, Pammy Rose said she always felt different and wasn't happy being a boy.

She recalled: 'I was very feminine when I was younger. I would run around the house with a T-shirt on my head pretending it was hair. I would tell my mum I'm a girl and I don't belong in this body.' 

During school Pammy Rose said she was often bullied and called names and she felt like a 'freak' because she wasn't comfortable living as a boy.

When she turned 14, she decided to embrace who she really was and started growing and bleaching her hair. She began wearing make-up and wore the girls' school uniform instead of the boys'.

She said: 'Once I came out and told everyone I was a woman, everything became a lot easier.'

Journey: Pammy was bullied at school but is enjoying life now she's living as a woman

At the age of 16 her mother, Julie, 49, took her to the doctors to begin her full transition into a female. 

A joke about her looking like Pamela Anderson led to her officially changing her name at the age of 18. The following year, she started taking hormones to begin the process to turn her into a woman.

In spring 2013, a friend entered her in a local beauty contest and she made it to the final.

Pammy Rose said: 'Until I told them in my interview, the organisers said they didn't even know I was transgender.

'I felt like I had to tell them because I really wanted to promote different people entering the competition.'

Following publicity surrounding the competition, Pammy Rose was complimented by Katie Price who spoke of her admiration of her journey in the national press and Tweeted her to wish her well.
