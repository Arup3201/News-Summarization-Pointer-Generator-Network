Martine Lapworth, 41, tried to pick up a child from school after bingeing on wine, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard

A ‘very drunk’ former teacher who drove to pick up a child from school after bingeing on wine has been spared jail.

Martine Lapworth, 41, was nearly four times over the drink-drive limit when she tried to collect the youngster, a court heard.

But staff at the school in Boothstown, Salford, were so concerned about Lapworth’s condition that they ordered her off the premises after a confrontation.

Lapworth got into her VW Polo and drove off without the child following the incident at 3.30pm on May 23, Manchester magistrates’ court was told.

Helen Veitch, prosecuting, said that shortly afterwards police visited Lapworth at her home in Worsley, less than a mile from the school, and found her in a ‘very drunken state’.

When tested she gave a reading of 128 micrograms of alcohol per 100ml of breath. The legal limit is 35mg.

She told officers that she had been drinking while cleaning her home, and admitted downing a mug of wine as she washed her car later.

Miss Veitch said an aggravating feature of the case was that Lapworth had intended to take the child in her car and would have done so but for the reluctance of the youngster and the intervention of school staff.

Lapworth pleaded guilty to driving after consuming excess alcohol and was sentenced to 12 weeks’ imprisonment suspended for a year.

She was banned from driving for three years.

Magistrate Bruce Westwood said that the offence merited a jail sentence.

He told her: ‘What you did crossed the custody threshold.

'You had drunk a great deal of alcohol but you have shown remorse and we intend to suspend the  sentence.’

William Birtwell, defending, said Lapworth was an alcoholic whose condition had had a ‘destructive effect’ on her life.

She had lost her job and her marriage had broken down as a consequence of her drinking.

She now lived on benefits and was receiving treatment for anxiety,  he added.

Mr Birtwell said Lapworth had sought 
help in the past from Salford Alcohol Services and had  re-engaged with 
them for further support in recent weeks.

Lapworth was banned from driving for three years and given a 12-week suspended prison sentence at Manchester Magistrates' Court

‘She has taken a mature stance and shown a great deal of remorse,’ he said.

‘She has not tried to minimise the 
seriousness of what she has done and this has been a steep learning 
curve for her. I doubt if you will see her in court again.’

Lapworth, who left the court  in tears, was ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs and an £80 surcharge.
