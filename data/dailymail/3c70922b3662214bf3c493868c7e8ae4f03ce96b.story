A nine-year-old girl with a broken leg was told to ‘walk it off’ by a doctor, her family claims.

Lucy Holmes was rollerskating with a friend when she fell and injured her leg two weeks ago.

Her mother Helen rushed her to the accident and emergency department at Hull Royal Infirmary, where she says they had to wait about six hours before being seen.

The doctor who examined Lucy asked her to walk on the injured leg, the family claims, but instead of sending her for an x-ray, the medic told her to go home and keep trying to walk.

Lucy Holmes, nine, was told by an A&E doctor to go home and try to walk on her injured leg, which turned out to be fractured

After a night of agony, Lucy returned to the Yorkshire hospital, where an x-ray showed she had a serious spiral fracture.

Lucy said: 'I was skating with my friend and I tried to avoid a pothole when I fell over.

'As I fell my leg went the other way, it was really painful.

'We went to hospital and I was really scared. I was told to walk on it but it was too sore. I can’t remember much else as I was in so much pain.

'It was a horrible experience.

'I am gutted as it is just the start of the summer holidays and I was looking forward to my holiday in Majorca, which we can’t go on now.'

Her father Lee said his daughter's treatment was 'unacceptable'.

'We feel really guilty because we were getting annoyed with Lucy on the Sunday night and said she must be overacting,' he said.

Mr Holmes said: 'We are not seeking monetary compensation but we want to highlight the problems we suffered.

'There is something drastically wrong when you can’t get an x-ray. We know there have been some cuts but is my daughter not worth an x-ray?”

The family, from Bilton, near Hull, have since found out that they will not be able to get a refund on their planned holiday to Majorca - because their travel insurance expired the day before Lucy's accident.

Mr Holmes said: 'We booked the holiday in February and were still insured.

'We
 understand there’s not a lot we can do but we hoped we might be able to
 pull on the heart strings and get something sorted on compassionate 
grounds.

'But, as it stands, we will have to pay between 70 and 90 per cent of the £2,000 holiday.'

Lucy will now spend her school summer holiday in plaster while the family have had to cancel their trip to Majorca

Lucy’s grandmother Pauline Holmes said: 'Something has to be done about this.

'You have to trust what the doctors say but when something like this happens you just don’t know right from wrong.'

Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust has confirmed it is looking into the case.

A spokesman said: 'For patient confidentiality reasons, we are unable to comment on the specific details of Miss Holmes’ treatment.

'We understand the family is in contact with our Patient Advice and Liaison team and we will be happy to discuss their concerns and respond to them directly in due course.'
