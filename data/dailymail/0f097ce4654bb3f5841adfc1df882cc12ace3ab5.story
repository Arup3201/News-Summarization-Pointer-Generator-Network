Notorious New York Yankees third-baseman Alex Rodriguez allegedly paid his cousin a total of $900,000 to stop him from exposing his suspected use of performance enhancing drugs, it was revealed today.

The allegations concerning Rodriguez’s financial dealings with his relative, Yuri Sucart, were outlined in documents filed last week in US District Court for the Southern District of Florida.

The court filings, obtained by the New York Daily News, state that in June 2013, the Yankees slugger paid just short of a million dollars to Sucart in so-called hush money.

'Hush money': Court filings state Alex Rodriguez paid his cousin Yuri Sucart one payment of $700,000 and three more totaling $200,000 as part of settlement in 2013

Sucart is facing federal charges in connection to a doping scandal revolving around the Florida rejuvenation clinic Biogenesis of America, which rocked Major League Baseball last year.

More than a dozen prominent baseball players ended up suspended for their alleged ties to the notorious clinic that was peddling illegal human growth hormones.

Rodriguez was hit with a 211-game suspension in August, but was allowed to play 49 games in the 2013 season pending his appeal.

That same month, Biogenesis founder Anthony Bosch agreed to enter a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to distribute testosterone, and he is currently awaiting sentencing.

Infamous: The New York Yankees third-baseman was among more than a dozen players who were suspended last year over use of performance enhancing drugs

According to court filings, Alex Rodriguez signed off in June 2013 on a confidential settlement with his cousin, whom he had previously named as his supplier of PEDs, paying him $700,000 in one payment, followed by three more installments totaling $200,000.

Six months earlier, Sucart's former attorney, Jeffrey Sonn, allegedly wrote a letter to Rodriguez demanding $5million and a 'life estate' for his client and his wife.

Sports Illustrated magazine reported in 2009 that Rodriguez had tested positive for anabolic steroid use in the 2003 season.

He later admitted using the drugs but dragged the name of his cousin Mr Sucart into the scandal claiming that he had encouraged him to take banned drugs and helped administer them.

Ready for comeback: The 39-year-old slugger is said to be laying the groundwork for his comeback

Sucart was subsequently banned by the Yankees from team flights, facilities and trips.

Rodriguez has not publicly commented on these latest revelations. The 39-year-old slugger, who has three more years left on his contract with the Yankees, is said to be laying the groundwork for his comeback.

'At some point in the future, Alex will have something to say,’ Ron Berkowitz, Rodriguez’s representative, told ESPN New York. ‘Today is not the time. When it is time, everyone will hear from Alex. Right now, he is working out and ready to return for 2015.’
