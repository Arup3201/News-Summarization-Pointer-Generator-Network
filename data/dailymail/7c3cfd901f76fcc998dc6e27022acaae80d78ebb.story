Hurricane Marie's presence on the south California coast has brought surfers to the shore in their droves. 

With waves crashing in at over 30 feet, the flock of wave-chasers are all out looking for the perfect swell.

And where there is a large gathering of surfers, there will be surf stunts.

This one is the most awe-inspiring one yet as a surfer takes two boards into the ocean and swaps them midsurf.

The unknown man is seen riding on the the swell of a giant wave as it thunders towards the shore. 

Tucked neatly under his arm is another surfboard and his body is tense as he prepares to carry out the risky move. 

He crests the swell with ease and in the blink of an eye, he's swapped the boards.

Making a swap: The surfer discards his pink and black striped board and smoothly jumps on another

A monster wave comes crashing down on him but not before he's gracefully ridden the surf 

The crowd cheers with delight as he manages to accomplish the awesome feat. 

He then gracefully glides across the choppy waters and manages to catch another wave before a monster swell comes crashing down, wiping him out.
