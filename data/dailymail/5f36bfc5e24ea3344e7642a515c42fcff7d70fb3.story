Chancellor George Osborne was today forced to defend a Conservative party advert aimed at working class voters, claiming 'they' enjoy bingo and cheap beer.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps 
took to Twitter last night to launch an advert devised by Tory HQ to 
highlight Budget measures supposedly aimed at ‘hardworking people’.

But it has been widely mocked online, and spawned spoof versions referring to whippets, clogs, eating swans, shooting poor people and suggesting the Tories think it is still 1961.

'PR disaster': Grant Shapps tweeted this Tory party advert about beer and bingo cuts in today's Budget

Tweet: The post was immediately slammed as 'ill conceived' by Labour's Ed Miliband

The
 advert read: ‘Bingo! 
Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more 
of the things they enjoy.’ Mr Shapps urged Conservative supporters to ‘spread the word’.

After waves of criticism and ridicule, a Tory source insisted: 'We stand by the advert.'

But the Lib Dems accused their coalition partners of being 'patronising', Labour said it was ‘condescending’ and the writers of political comedy The Thick Of It said they would have rejected it from a script for being 'too far-fetched'.

In a round of media interviews this morning Mr Osborne was repeatedly asked to defend the advert, distracting from his key announcements on help for savers and pensioners.

Tory Chairman Grant Shapps, who tweeted the advert this afternoon after the Budget announcement

In yesterday's Budget Mr Osborne took 
1p off the price of a pint of beer and dramatically halved duty paid on 
bingo from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.

Both measures were seen as part of carefully crafted pitch to win over the skilled manual workers who backed Margaret Thatcher in their droves.

But
 the row over the advert - in particular the use of the word 'they' to 
refer to people who like beer and bingo - has overshadowed the message 
about help for bingo halls and pubs.

'These are important Budget measures, they are not the only Budget measures,' Mr Osborne told the BBC.

'This whole story... was whipped up by a Labour Party that didn’t have anything else to say about the economy.

'We
 are communicating what’s in the Budget. The more people hear about the 
Budget the more confident people can be that they are on the right 
track.'

But his Lib Dem deputy at the Treasury, Danny Alexander, made clear his unease at the ad from his coalition partners.

He it was 'rather patronising' and 'demeans some quite sensible things' in the Budget.

'There
 are good reasons to be supporting Bingo, there are good reasons to be 
encouraging our pub sector to be stronger - that’s the analysis behind 
those measures,' he told BBC 2’s Newsnight programme. 'This language, well that’s for Grant Shapps to justify.'

Nick Clegg said Grant Shapps’ tweet of a Tory poster was “silly”, but should not detract from a strong Budget.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'I think the tweet was a bit silly, partly because actually the issues involved in this Budget were really quite serious, including, by the way, giving support to the bingo industry – an important industry – giving support to our pubs and so on.'

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in on LBC, Mr Clegg added: 'There were just much bigger things at stake in the Budget as well, namely how are over 24million people going to benefit, which they will now do with an additional £100 tax cut.

'The very important package we’ve been working on for weeks to help savers... because people who save, first, should be trusted more with how they manage their own money, their own savings; but secondly, after years and years of low interest rates, we need to make sure as the recovery starts taking root that savers who haven’t really benefitted from that stand to do so from now on.'

Stewart Wood, a senior aide to Labour leader Ed Miliband, described the advert as ‘ill-conceived’ and ‘condescending’.

He said: ‘Of all the ill-conceived aspects of this Tory ad, it’s the condescending use of the word “they” that grates the most.’

Stephen Tall, editor of the grassroots
 Liberal Democrat website LibDem Voice, described the ad as an 
‘embarrassment’, and said it ‘goes back to the 1950s’.

Some Twitter users suggested the advert must be a spoof.

Others
 said it reminded them of Pulp’s hit record ‘Common People’ which mocked
 the futile attempts of a rich student to understand the struggle faced 
by working class people.

Spoof versions of the advert were circulating on the Internet within minutes of its release by Mr Shapps.

One said: ‘Cut the bingo tax and beer duty. That’s what you wretched proles get up to, isn’t it?

'So put on your clogs and grab your whippets and have at it’.

But
 some Tories were dismayed at the advert. One said: ‘Why are we talking 
about beer and bingo, not cuts in income tax? We just look like we’re 
talking down to people.’

Simone Blackwell, a writer on political satire The Thick Of It, said the ad was beyond satire

Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander last night distanced himself from the Tory advert. He told the BBC’s Newsnight programme: ‘I thought it was a spoof at first. It may be our budget, but it’s their words. It’s pretty patronising.’

Labour’s shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie described the advert as ‘quite astonishing’.

‘What better demonstration do you need that they are out of touch?’

The
 overwhelmingly negative reaction to the advert is a major embarrassment
 for Mr Shapps, a grammar school boy who prides himself on his 
understanding of ordinary voters.

Mr Shapps has made it a major priority for the Tories to increase their effectiveness on social media, such as Twitter.

He is now likely to face questions about who designed the advert and why he agreed to sign it off.

It is also embarrassing for David Cameron, who is sensitive to charges that he is part of an out-of-touch metropolitan elite.

A major poll conducted by former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft last month found that the most common description of the Prime Minister by voters was ‘out of touch’.

Mr Cameron has also faced discomfort over his reliance on fellow Old Etonians within his inner circle.Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked anger in Number 10 last week by describing the number of Old Etonians at the heart of Government as ‘preposterous’.

In 2012, Andrew Mitchell, then chief whip, was 
involved in a heated row with another police officer, Toby Rowland, 
after he was refused permission to cycle through the main gate of 
Downing Street.

Mr Mitchell, accused of calling the officer a ‘pleb’, was forced to resign his post after a month of intense media interest.

Two police officers were sacked over the so-called ‘Plebgate’. One, Keith Wallis, was jailed for a year at the Old Bailey for misconduct in a public office.
