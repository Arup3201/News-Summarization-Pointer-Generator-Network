A Massachusetts man busted for 
speeding had a pretty good excuse when he was pulled over: He had just 
won a big lottery prize and was on his way to collect his cash.

It turns out Thursday was 22-year-old Scott Lowe's lucky day in more ways than one. The officer who pulled him over in Hingham issued a verbal warning and urged him to drive safely.

Lowe, of Rockland, told the officer he was speeding because he had won $50,000 on a scratch-off ticket and was on his way to Massachusetts State Lottery headquarters in Braintree to collect his winnings.

WCVB-TV reports that police say Lowe was shaking, and showed the officer his winning ticket.

According to Hingham police Sergeant Steven Dearth, the man was driving on Sharp Street at 11 a.m. and was going 49 miles per hour in a 35-mile-per-hour zone.

After the warning, he went on his way and claimed his prize.

The officer said, ‘You’ve got to get there slow, otherwise you won’t be able to use your winnings’,' Dearth told the Boston Globe.

Lottery officials told the New York Daily News that Lowe filled out the paperwork for his winnings on Thursday and that he walked away with $35,000 after 30 per cent was taken out for taxes.

Lowe was not photographed by the state Lottery because $50,000 is not considered a large enough sum of money to merit a photo for most media outlets.

'It came as a big surprise. It's certainly not the fashion in which most people make their way here to claim a prize,' spokeswoman Beth Bresnahan told the Daily News.

'He was very excited and a little shaky because of all the excitement.'

The Hingham Police Department thought the event was amusing and shared the story on their Twitter. Luckily Lowe had his lotto ticket with him to prevent him from getting a speeding ticket.

Lowe's mother spoke with the Daily News and said that she is slightly concerned for her son's safety because there have been robberies in the area and she fears his new found wealth may attract unwanted attention.

The Mail Online contacted Lowe's mother who said she did not wish for her son's photo in the paper for safety reasons as well. 

The police were so amused by the incident that they decided to share it on their official twitter account
