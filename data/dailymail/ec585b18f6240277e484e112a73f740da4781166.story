David Zolkwer - who has worked on scores of huge events around the world - was the creative mind behind last night's opening ceremony in Glasgow

This is the man behind the Glasgow 2014 opening ceremony - who can also claim credit for some of the world's biggest events including the Royal Wedding.

David Zolkwer, 50, has been the creative director, producer and consultant behind scores of huge shows across the world.

His sporting credits alone include both ceremonies of the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, the 2008 Beijing ceremonies and the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

He also directed the 2002 Commonwealth Games ceremonies in his native Manchester.

Although British film maker Danny Boyle was famously drafted in to direct the London 2012 shows, Mr Zolkwer was asked to organise the Team GB homecoming parade through central London.

Mr Zolkwer, who now lives in London, has also organised numerous other events throughout his career - including the much anticipated wedding of Prince William and the then Catherine Middleton in 2011.

Mr Zolkwer's was the creative director for the celebration sites in London's Hyde Park and Trafalgar Square for the wedding - which saw millions of people descend on to the streets of the capital to celebrate the royal nuptials.

He was also creative director for the annual New Year's Eve celebrations in London from 2007-2012, which were regularly attended by 350,000 people per year.

His huge body of work has been noted with an Honorary Doctorate by Middlesex University for his 'outstanding contribution to his profession and his community'.

Speaking before the Glasgow Opening Ceremony - which was watched by 9.4million people at its peak - Mr Zolkwer said he hoped it would 'speak directly to the rest of the world.'

He added that his ceremony would celebrate the diversity of Scotland and what it had in common with the rest of the 70 competing nations.

In 2007/08, Mr Zolkwer was a creative consultant behind the ceremonies for the Beijing Olympics - one spectacular firework display from the opening of the games pictured

The 50-year-old was also behind the celebration sites for the Royal Wedding of Prince William and the now Duchess of Cambridge in 2011

He told The Daily Record: 'We have a mass cast but we have set out to represent lots and lots of individuals.

'You will see lots of individuals encouraged to do their own thing in a rehearsed and considered way.

'It's not about homogenising the city or asking them to pretend to be anything other than who they are.'

He added: 'It's got humour, warmth, celebrating what we have in common.

'Having said all that, it will always feel like it was created in Glasgow.

'So, although we are telling a universal story, we are telling it with a distinctly Glaswegian accent, which means we are going to be irreverent, funny, principled, sincere, inclusive, personal, direct.'

In 2002, Mr Zolkwer returned to his hometown to direct the ceremonies for the Manchester Commonwealth Games (closing ceremony pictured)

The opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games - with its dancing Tunnock's Teacakes and show-stealing Scottie dogs - was watched by more than nine million viewers on BBC1.

The Glasgow spectacle, which featured musical performances by Rod Stewart and Nicola Benedetti, had a peak audience of 9.4 million - exceeding the number who watched the last time the Games were staged in the UK in 2002, when 8.9 million tuned in at the height of the Manchester opening.

An average of 7.6 million watched for the duration of the programme, which lasted more than three hours, down from the 8.2 million who stuck with the whole ceremony 12 years ago.

But the audience was up hugely on the levels for 2010 stage in Delhi, which drew an average of 3 million, and 2006 for Melbourne, which pulled in 1.3 million.

Last night's coverage accounted for more than two-fifths of the viewers watching TV at that time.
