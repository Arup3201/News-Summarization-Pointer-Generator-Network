Liverpool have activated Lazar Markovic's £20million release clause as they move closer to completing a deal for the Benfica winger.

Manager Brendan Rodgers is keen to spend the £75m he will recuperate from the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona and he is nearing adding Markovic to his squad.

The Anfield club have been in discussions with Benfica for weeks over a deal for the 20-year-old and there are a few details left to iron out before he can be unveiled as a Liverpool player.

Target: Markovic will undergo his medical at Anfield on Thursday ahead of his move

Chelsea have also shown an interest in the Serbian winger in recent months but Liverpool are confident they will sign Markovic within the coming days.

Markovic has played 12 times for Serbia, scoring twice, and he netted seven goals in 49 appearances for Benfica last season.

Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Emre Can have already been added to the playing roster at Anfield - for a combined total of nearly £40m - as Rodgers looks to build a side who can challenge for the Premier League title against next season.

Markovic will be the fourth attacking addition at Liverpool but Rodgers is keen to bolster his defence and is still pursuing a deal for Southampton's Croatian centre back Dejan Lovren.
