This micro pig must be barking mad.

Gilbert was bought as a tiny companion to a pair of Yorkshire Terriers has grown up thinking he's a dog - and now begs for biscuits and rolls over.

The two-year-old was raised with the dogs after his owners snapped him up during the craze to have the miniature animals as family pets.

But it is thought the Yorkie's behaviour rubbed off on confused Gilbert and now the pig will come when he's called, roll over on command and even beg for a biscuit.

Good pig! Gilbert begs Mel Haye from the Sanctuary, for a treat. The confused porker's favourite snacks are dog biscuits and bananas

Peek-a-pig! Gilbert pokes his head through the cat flap, and loves to beg and roll over

He also bangs on the door with his snout to be let into the house, gives kisses to his masters and mistresses and tries to help bring in the post too.

But despite his canine-like talents, Gilbert who started life no bigger than the size of teacup has had to be given a new home after he grew so big his owners were unable to cope with him.

He is now starting a new life at Wilmslow Animal Sanctuary, in Wilmslow, Cheshire - with his old owners making regular visits and making donations towards his upkeep.

Trustee and fundraising coordinator, Melanie Hay, said: 'Gilbert is just like a dog, it's so funny he honestly believes he is one.

'He's big like a dog in size and when you call his name he comes running.

'He sits very well and he will roll over when you ask him to.

Gilbert wasn't abandoned but his family decided they could no longer look after him and asked the sanctuary to take him 

'He just loves playing and he can beg for biscuits like a dog too. He loves to run around and be silly and he has his mad half hours just like dogs.

'If he wants to come inside he bangs on the door with his snout or sticks his head through the cat flap.

'He goes and gets the post but instead of bringing it to us he runs off with it and won't give us it back.

'I think a lot of his "doggy" behaviour has to do with the fact that with his original owners he was brought up with two Yorkshire terrier's.

'I think a lot of how they were must have rubbed off on him.

'He's a real character and he just loves interacting with people.

'The other day he went in my handbag and ran off with my banana, just like a puppy. I had to chase him for it and when I took it from him he just looked at me and gave this loud grunt.'

Micro pigs are a miniature breed, which start out no bigger than a teacup, before growing to a slightly smaller size than a normal pig, around human knee height.

Celebrities such as Paris Hilton bought the tiny piglets and were shocked when the ballooned in size.

However, although Gilbert's previous owners knew he would grow, they could no longer look after him.

Melanie continued: 'Gilbert's original owners knew what they were getting when they got Gilbert, it wasn't a surprise when he got so big.

'But they were moving house and where they were moving to didn't have a garden, so they couldn't take Gilbert with them.

'They visit him all the time and they make donations to the sanctuary for looking after him.

'The good thing is that now he's living the most wonderful life, he talks to the chickens, he's got the ponies as friends and he's got another potbellied pig too.

'Gilbert will stay with us now as part of the sanctuary. His owners know where he is and can come and visit and he's having a fabulous time too.

'He's happy here and we're happy to have to him.

'We've got a real assortment of animals here, we've got 12 ponies, a donkey, two pigs, a lot of chickens, five ferrets, three rabbits and 25 cats, who live here as they cannot be rehomed.

'It costs about £200,000 to keep them all and we don't get support from anywhere except public donations.

'It can be a real struggle but we need to keep going for the sake of animals like Gilbert.'
