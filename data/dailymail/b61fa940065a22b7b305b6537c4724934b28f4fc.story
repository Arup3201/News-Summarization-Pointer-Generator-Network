A professional surfer fled the waves during a competition yesterday after claiming he saw a large shark in the water 'coming straight at him'.

Hawaiian surfer Dusty Payne left the water at San Francisco's Ocean Beach during the Rip Curl Pro Search event after spotting 'the biggest fin I've ever seen' a short distance away.

A jet ski was launched to investigate the sighting but the competition featuring ten-time world champion Kelly Slater was able to continue.

Speaking to Rip Curl Pro Search event's camera crew, Payne said: 'I was just sitting there, and I was waiting for a wave. I’ve seen dolphins before, and it wasn’t a dolphin.

'It was the biggest fin I’ve ever seen in my life coming straight at me.'

Dave Prodan, media director for the Association of Surfing Professionals, said a jet ski saw a dolphin rather than a shark, but wouldn't rule out the possibility both could have been in the water at the same time.

He said: 'Aside from Payne’s initial report, no further sighting of the animal was confirmed and the competition resumed without pausing.'

The sighting follows a shark attack on a surfer on Saturday at Marina State Beach in Monterey County, California.

Eric Tarantino, 27, was surfing with 
friends on Saturday morning at Marina State Beach in Monterey County 
when a nine-foot shark bit him on the neck and right forearm.

The animal also left teeth marks on his surfboard, his friends said.

While the waters off San Francisco are known to be host to white sharks, attacks are rare. The last attack, which was not fatal, occurred Nov. 2, 2005, according to the Shark Research Committee.

Despite Tuesday’s alleged sighting, the contest continued all day.

Ten-time world champion Kelly Slater, 39, won his heat, needing only one more winning heat during the San Francisco contest to capture his 11th title.

The contest in San Francisco began Tuesday, and is the first professional surfing event in the city in decades.
