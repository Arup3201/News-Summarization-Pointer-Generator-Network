She has been a contracted Victoria's 
Secret Angel for 13 years so it's safe to say that Adriana Lima knows exactly what she's doing when it comes to modelling.

And the 31-year-old's latest underwear shoot for the lingerie giant does not disappoint.

Adriana showcases her perfectly toned and tanned body as she strikes a pose in an array of sexy lingerie and swimwear.

In some of the shots, the mother-of-two dons revealing hot pink and black lingerie, which she playfully undoes for the camera.

In other images, she can been seen smouldering in more demure camisoles and silk shorts.

There are also a few snaps of her showcasing the brand's summer swimwear line as she poses on a tropical beach in an array of colourful items.

The model wears her chocolate brown hair in a variety of styles and sizzles with her smokey-eyed beauty look.

Just like fellow Angels Alessandra 
Ambrosio and Doutzen Kroes, and recently retired Angel Miranda Kerr, 
Adriana made a superhuman recovery after giving birth to her second 
child, her daughter Sienna, last year.

Adriana credited boxing for getting 
her runway ready when she was given the arduous task of returning to the
Victoria's Secret catwalk last year just eight weeks after her baby 
girl arrived in September 2012.

Joining
forces with professional boxer Michael Olajide, who co-founded the 
AeroSpace fitness studio in New York, she revealed that she worked out 
an astonishing six hours a day in five weeks before the show.

The supermodel did the training in two three hour sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening, as soon as she got the green light from her doctor.

'The doctor gave me the okay about three weeks after I gave birth and literally two days after that I started working out -- every single day, two times a day,' she explained at the time.

Adriana said that when she discovered boxing, she knew it was the right exercise for her.

'I discovered boxing, accepting that it is great for the body, wonderful for the mind and it give you the best shape ever,' she said. 'It is a challenge, I love a challenge.'

The Brazilian model and actress finished first in Ford's Supermodel of Brazil competition when she was just fifteen.

In 2012, she came 4th on the Forbes top-earning models list, estimated to have earned £4.75 million in one year.

She is married to Serbian basketball player Marko Jarić, with whom she has two daughters.
