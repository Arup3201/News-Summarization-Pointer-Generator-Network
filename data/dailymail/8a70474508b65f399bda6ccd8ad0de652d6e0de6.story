A young woman has described in great detail the horrific moment a fellow surfer was snatched from the ocean by a shark just metres from her, and the traumatic and gruesome events that followed the fatal attack.

Brooke Mason, 20, was surfing at Shelly Beach  on the New South Wales north coast last Monday with a group of around eight others, including Japanese national Tadashi Nakahara.

Nakahara, 41, had both his legs severed straight off in the horrific attack and was pronounced dead at the scene after losing a huge amount of blood.

'I just watched him, I thought he just got off his board took a deep breath and went in for a swim,' Ms Mason told Daily Mail Australia, speaking of the moment Nakahara was pulled underwater.

Tasmanian competitive surfer Brooke Mason, 20, witnessed the horrific fatal shark attack that killed Tadashi Nakahara at Shelly Beach on the NSW north coast last week

About eight other surfers were out in a group when the 41-year-old was snatched from the ocean and dragged underwater at Shelly Beach (pictured)

'I was just watching waiting for him to come back up and he didn't come back up ... The reason I knew it was a shark was there was blood everywhere in the water. It nearly reached me,' she revealed, adding she couldn't have been more than 15 metres from him. 

'There wasn't a sound, it just pulled him under quiet as,' the competitive surfer continued.

The Tasmanian woman said she had always had an enormous fear of sharks, but the attack was nothing like she had envisioned.

She had moved to the area only days before, and the devastating attack took place during her second surf in her new home. 

Ms Mason described the eerie calmness and quiet of the water as she and the other surfers tried to make it back to shore safely after Nakahara had been bitten.

'Everyone was ashen faced paddling in and...There was no waves in, it was the scariest moment of my life', Ms Mason revealed. 

When she had almost reached the shore the young woman said she turned around to see one brave man pulling in Nakahara's disfigured body from the ocean, as another man rushed to help him.

Ms Mason told of the horror of seeing blood fill the water around her and her fear that she would also be attacked

The 20-year-old had moved to the town just two days before the shark attack which has made her reconsider her professional surfing career

Ms Mason, a medical student, acted quickly once Nakahara's body was out of the water tourniquetting the man's legs with ropes from surfboards

'As they were pulling him in I saw that he had no legs, he literally had an inch.'

Having completed her first year of medical school Ms Mason acted quickly, tourniquetting the man's legs with ropes from the group's surfboards.

'I've done first year med school so I was pretty okay with seeing his body,' Ms Mason said.

'I went up and held his head while they were doing CPR.

'I was just saying things like "it’s going to be okay, you’re going to be fine".

'And then there was a pulse and everyone clapped and cheered, there was so much camaraderie.'

Shortly after this paramedics arrived and Ms Mason rushed to meet them at the top of the sand to show them where Nakahara was laying.

'I raced up the hill to the ambulance man and he handed me a defibrillator and something else,' the young woman revealed. 

'I went to run back down to the beach and he stopped me and told me to calm down.

The young woman said she was shattered when paramedics told her Nakahara wasn't going to make it 

Ms Mason revealed that the traumatic experience had made her even more determined to continue her medical studies

The 20-year-old medical student then helped transport Nakahara's body to a stretcher

'I thought every second was crucial but the paramedic said to me "This guy (Nakahara) pretty much has no hope of surviving".

'That was shattering to hear,' Ms Mason recalled.

The 41-year-old surfer's body then lay on the sand for ten minutes while a crowd of 'at least 30 people' watched on.

'They (paramedics) went over and pronounced him dead and he was just lying there for ten minutes and there was all these kids around, it was like a horror scene,' Ms Mason said.

The 20-year-old medical student then helped transport Nakahara's body to a stretcher before it was taken away in an ambulance.

'Me and another girl I babysit plus a few paramedics carried the body up, and his stumps were rubbing against my arms the whole time,' Ms Mason recalled.

Since the horrific attack the surfer said she's had a hard time dealing with the incident, and the traumatic experience has made her reevaluate her aspirations of being a professional surfer.

'I’m just so in shock still I can’t get the images out of my brain,' Ms Mason said.

With her best friend Leo (left) by her side Ms Mason returned to the waves just a week after the incident, in honour of Nakahara's life

'It’s made me think I don’t want surfing to be my whole life.'

She's grappled with the reason Nakahara was taken and not her or someone else, pointing out that the event has really opened her eyes to how quickly life can be taken away.

'I guess you just don’t really understand why it wasn't you, like I had my full body in the water and it doesn't make sense that he went past my legs and attacked him, I don't understand,' Ms Mason said.

The student also said the horrific incident might be a push for her to continue with her medical studies and 'really make a difference in the world'. 

'It’s made me really realise if I was a doctor maybe I could have saved him.'

After the attack Ms Mason went home to see her parents in Tasmania, who tried to convince her to stay away from the water for good.

'My parents got so freaked out they made me come home and wanted to see me well and alive,' she revealed.

But the surfer said she returned to the water just a week after Nakahara's death, to honour him and try and calm her own nerves.

With her best friend Leo by her side the 20-year-old said the surf was still tough, and she had flashbacks of the attack.

'When people were falling off I kept thinking they'd been taken by a shark, I have to remind myself to calm down', Ms Mason said.

'(But) it was actually a really good surf and I feel like he sent a few good waves my way,' Ms Mason revealed.

(It was) just as a bit of a memorial and to celebrate his life.'
