Ronald Koeman's remarkable job with Southampton continued to progress on Saturday afternoon as his rebuilt Saints squad defeated Newcastle 2-1 at St James' Park.

January loan signing Eljero Elia fired in both goals to keep the south coast side third in the Premier League, holding Champions League qualification chasers Manchester United and Arsenal at bay. 

Here is all you need to know about the latest canny bit of business by Koeman...

WHO IS HE?

The 27-year-old Dutchman joined on loan from Werder Bremen at the start of the month.

WHAT’S HIS HISTORY?

Played for ADO Den Haag and FC Twente in Holland, then Hamburg and Juventus before joining Bremen in 2012. He has 27 caps for Holland, including an appearance as a substitute in the 2010 World Cup final.

WHAT KIND OF PLAYER IS HE?

A fast, strong winger.

WHAT ABOUT HIS PERSONALITY?

No shrinking violet. He left his first club after falling out with the manager. He has had rows with fans on social media and he was fined by Hamburg for complaining that they had not looked after him enough following an ankle operation.
