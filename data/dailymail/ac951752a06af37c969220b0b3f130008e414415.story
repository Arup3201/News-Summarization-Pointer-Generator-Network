Elena Vesnina, breezed through to the second round in just 53 minutes at the expense of Austrian Patricia Mayr-Achleitner - and the Russian will pick up at least £43,000.

The 27-year-old won 6-0, 6-4 to register the first victory of this year's Wimbledon Championships.

But it wasn't all bad news for Mayr-Achleitner who receives £27,000 for her day's work.

Easy day's work: Elena Vesnina on her way to victory over Patricia Mayr-Achleitner

Meanwhile, former US Open champion 
Samantha Stosur became the first major casualty on the opening day at 
Wimbledon as the Australian suffered a first-round loss.

The 30-year-old was beaten 6-3 6-4 by Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer on Court Three, situated on the site of the old Court Two which became known as the 'graveyard of champions'.

Wickmayer, supported from the stands by countrywoman and four-time grand slam winner Kim Clijsters, whose academy she trains at, clinched her victory with a classy forehand cross-court winner.

For 17th seed Stosur, the result was the latest in a long line of Wimbledon disappointments and means that after 12 visits she still has yet to go beyond the third round.

Stosur, who last week ended a working partnership with Briton Miles Maclagan, a former coach of Andy Murray and Laura Robson, said of her early exit: 'I don't feel like I played bad. There's only so much you can really be down on yourself about apart from losing.'

She said of her hunt for a new coach: 'I think I still know what I want out of them. There's probably a handful of coaches that you might want to think about. They've probably all got jobs.'

Sloane 
Stephens, the 21-year-old American, was a quarter-finalist at Wimbledon 
in 2013 but made a first-day exit this time, losing what always looked a
 tricky opening assignment against Maria Kirilenko. Russian Kirilenko, 
who reached the last eight two years ago, prevailed 6-2 7-6 (8/6) on 
Court 18.

Stephens said: 'It feels like the end of the world now, but fortunately it's not. So that's a good thing.'

She
 suggested she was having problems behind the scenes, adding: 'There's 
things that you guys don't know about, a lot of things that everyone 
else doesn't see, but you have to work through it and you have to deal 
with it. Sometimes you've got to be a big girl and just work through all
 the things that are troubling you.'

Japanese
 43-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm threatened an upset against an opponent 
18 years her junior as she swept ahead against Russian 22nd seed 
Ekaterina Makarova.

However from 5-0 ahead in the first set Date-Krumm's high standards began to fall and the veteran was beaten 3-6 6-4 7-5.

Date-Krumm
 said: 'She's top 20 and she is a tough player, a big fighter. If I lost
 6-1 6-1 or 6-1 6-2 or something like that then I would need to give up.

'But still I almost won, and my physical level is still not bad for 43 years old.'
