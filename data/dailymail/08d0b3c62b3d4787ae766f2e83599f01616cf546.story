When Alexander and Danielle Meitiv waved goodbye to their children at a Maryland park just before Christmas last year, they thought nothing of letting the youngsters walk a mile home on their own.

After all, Rafi, 10, and Dvora, six, had been on three trips together already, walking up to three quarters of a mile from their parents' house in Montgomery County.

Alex and Danielle, who describe themselves as 'free-range parents', encouraged them to take the journeys to learn responsibility, build confidence, and teach them about the outside world. 

But on this occasion the kids made it halfway home before the cops arrived. They took the infants home, Child Protective Services were called, and Alex and Danielle were accused of neglect.

Danielle (pictured) says she and husband Alexander often let their children Rafi, ten, and Dvora, six, walk alone to teach them about the world - but they have now been accused of neglect

Alexander was asked to sign a form saying he wouldn't let the children go out unsupervised and initially refused, but was told that Rafi and Dvora could be taken away otherwise, so he gave in.

Workers from Montgomery County Child Protective Services (CPS) even went to their children's school and questioned the youngsters without their parents' knowledge.

Alex and Danielle have yet to learn whether any further action will be taken against them, but say whatever happens next, the experience has left them furious.

Danielle told the Washington Post: 'I think what CPS considered neglect, we felt was an essential part of growing up and maturing. 

Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'.

'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe.

However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress.

Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own.

Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves.

'We feel we’re being bullied into a point of view about child-rearing that we strongly disagree with.'

The Meitivs are advocates of 'free range parenting', a school of thought set up in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parents', who micro-manage every element of their children's lives in an attempt to keep them safe.

Danielle insists that while their hands-off approach may panic some people, in fact she is just trying to give her children the same 'old-fashioned' upbringing she had.

She told WUSA-TV: 'I grew up in New York City in the '70s and nobody hesitated to let their kids walk around. 

'The world is actually even safer than when I was a child. The only thing that's changed between then and now is our fear.

'I think it’s absolutely critical for their development — to learn responsibility, to experience the world, to gain confidence and competency.'

She describes parenthood as being 'an exercise in risk management' and say her and her husband spend the same amount of time as any parent worrying about what is and isn't safe.

The only difference is where they decide to draw the line.

She said parents should stop worrying that their children are going to be abducted, saying such disappearances are 'incredibly rare', and should instead focus on more likely problems, such as road safety.

Danielle and Alex waved goodbye to their children at this park in Montgomery County on December 20. The next time they saw them they were in the back of a police car after cops picked them up

She often lets the children go for walks together, around the block, or up to the local 7/11. They even carry a card which reads: 'I'm not lost, I'm a free range kid.'

However, when police stopped the children on December 20 as they were walking back home from Woodside Park, they didn't have the card on them.

The children told officers that they weren't doing anything wrong by walking home, but were still put into a patrol car and driven back to their house.

Alexander said he was given a 'tense' lecture by officers on the dangers of the world. But the real problem began after they left and the CPS showed up.

Even now, more than a month on, their ordeal is not over. According to the Meitivs the CPS tried to search their house, but they refused to answer the door.

They say they have a meeting set for next week at CPS offices in Rockville, but don't know what the outcome will be.

A CPS spokeswoman told the Post that they couldn't comment on individual cases, but pointed to state law which says children under eight must be left with a responsible person aged at least 13.

Police said they could not find information on the case, but a spokeswoman said that when concerns are reported, 'we have a responsibility as part of our duty to check on people’s welfare.'
