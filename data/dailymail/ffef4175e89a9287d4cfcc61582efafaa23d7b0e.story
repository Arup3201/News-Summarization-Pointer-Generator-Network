The early history of civiilisation has been 'filled in' a little as scientists have found settlements up to 8,000 years old dotted across Syria.

The area is thought to have been critical for the growth of civilisation - and thought to have been one of the first places where early man domesticated cattle.

MIT scientists have created software that scans satellite images for towns and settlements - looking for telltalle lighter soil and mounds from the collapse of mud huts.

The software has found 9,000 settlements - which Harvard Professor Jason Ur describes as a 'lifetime's worth'.

The MIT software looks for signs of ancient settlements including earth disturbed by collapsing mud huts, and lighter areas of earth created by disturbed soil

The new sites might reveal clues to the earliest complex human societies - although the instability of the region might hinder investigation. 

Jason Ur, Professor of the Social Sciences at Harvard
University, worked with Bjoern Menze, a research affiliate in MIT's Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, to develop a system that
identified settlements.

The software scans for telltale signs including soil
discolorations and the distinctive mounding that results from the collapse of
mud-brick settlements.

Prof Ur used a computer to examine
satellite images of a 23,000 square-kilometre area of north-eastern Syria, and
turned up around 9,000 possible settlements, an increase of ‘at least an order
of magnitude’ over what had previously been identified.

Prof Ur said: ‘I could do this on the ground, but it would
probably take me the rest of my life to survey an area this size.

‘With these computer science techniques, however, we can
immediately come up with an enormous map which is methodologically very
interesting, but which also shows the staggering amount of human occupation
over the last 7,000 or 8,000 years.

The sofware looks for distinctive mounds created by collapsing huts, and uses the traces to identify likely settlements

‘What's more, anyone who comes back to this area for any
future survey would already know where to go.

‘There's no need to do this sort of initial reconnaissance
to find sites. This allows you to do targeted work, so it maximizes the time we
have on the ground.’

The research was published in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
