The third woman to accuse Bill Cosby of raping her as a teenager has said that she is speaking out so that people know he's not 'Mr. Clean'.

Joan Tarshis, a former publicist, wrote an essay for Hollywood Elsewhere on Sunday accusing the entertainer of assaulting her on two occasions in 1969, when she was 19.

Tarshis said that after it happened, she felt she couldn't speak out because of how others idolized him but that she is now stepping forward in light of accusations made by other women.

'I thought nobody would believe me because of his image, you know, whiter than snow,' she told The Wrap.

Speaking out: Bill Cosby, pictured left on Monday, has been accused of rape by a third woman, Joan Tarshis (right), who said he attacked her twice in 1969 when she was working as a writer for him

In the piece for Hollywood Elsewhere, she explained that she had been in Los Angeles to write for comedian Godfrey Cambridge and she was introduced to Cosby by two women she was staying with.

He invited her to have lunch with him at Universal Studios and 'seemed to take a liking' to her, she said. He invited her back a few times and always poured her strong drinks, she wrote.

One day, he asked her to work on some material with him so she went to his bungalow, where he poured her a drink and she started talking about her ideas, she said. 

'The next thing I remember was coming to on his couch while being undressed,' she wrote.

'Through the haze I thought I was being clever when I told him I had an infection and he would catch it and his wife would know he had sex with someone.

'But he just found another orifice to use. I was sickened by what was happening to me and shocked that this man I had idolized was now raping me. Of course I told no one.' 

'Victim': Tarshis has claimed that Cosby gave her strong drinks that caused her to pass out and that she wake up naked. She said she felt that she could not speak out because of his 'whiter than snow' reputation

In November 2006, Bill Cosby settled a civil lawsuit with Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee who claimed he had drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. 

Her lawyers said they had the names of 13 other women who had come forward voluntarily with similar accounts of drugging or abuse at the hands of Cosby - but the settlement was reached before the other women could testify.

Last month, Barbara Bowman revealed to MailOnline that she had been drugged and raped by Cosby in 1985, when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. She was one of the 13 women willing to support Constand in 2006.

Joan Tarshis has become the latest woman to accuse him of raping her. On Sunday, she revealed she was working as a writer for Cosby in 1969, when he drugged and sexually abused her on two occasions, she said.

Her mother was proud of her daughter's new connection and so when Cosby called to invite Tarshis to a theater production, she felt as if she had to go to the show, she said.

She met him at his hotel, where she says his shaving kit was filled with bottles of pills, and then they went to the show together. In the car, he gave her a drink, she said.

After the show, she was having difficulties standing up and asked the chauffeur to take her back home, she said.

'The next thing I remember was waking up in his bed back at the Sherry, naked,' she wrote. 'I remember thinking "You old s***, I guess you got me this time, but it’s the last time you’ll ever see me".'

Afterwards, she said nothing for 20 years.

'During those years as I grew into adulthood, I watched Cosby be praised by everyone from Presidents to Oprah to the Jello Corporation,' she wrote. 'It all made me ill.'

Speaking to Inside Edition, she explained she felt helpless.

'He’s too powerful,' she said. 'How can you stop him? I’m just a little person. What am I going to say? "He raped me?" Who is going to believe that?'

Speaking to The Wrap after she wrote the piece, she said that she decided to speak out after other women came forward. MailOnline exclusively shared Barbara Bowman's story last month.

'All through the years, before I mentioned it, before anything else came out, I knew I wasn't the only person,' she said. 'That it wasn't just me... I knew that he was a serial rapist.'

She said she hopes her claims go some way to affecting the public's view of him.

Accusations: Last month, Barbara Bowman, who is pictured with an image of her teenage self, told MailOnline how she had been attacked by Cosby. Bowman's story gave Tarshis strength to speak out, she said

She also said she waited until now because she didn't want her parents to find out. Both are now in their 90s and the news won't reach them, she said. 

'They would have really, really been damaged by me telling them something, or finding out something like this,' she said. 

Squeaky clean image: Tarshis said that she hated seeing Cosby on TV, knowing what he had done

Today, she continues to blame herself, she said.

'It still kind of feels that way, that I should have known better,' she said. 'I know intellectually that's incorrect, but that's still a feeling that I have.' 

Tarshis, who lives in upstate New York, became a music publicist in the 1980s and represented Bob Marley and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, among others. She later worked as a journalist and is now getting a master's in mental health counseling, the Wrap reported. 

The renewed attention on Cosby's past began last month when comedian Hannibal Buress assailed him during a stand-up performance in Philadelphia, Cosby's hometown, calling him a 'rapist'.

His remarks were captured on video and posted online, gaining wide exposure.  

Adding to the growing firestorm: One of Cosby's accusers, Barbara Bowman, leveled allegations of sexual assault against him - first speaking to MailOnline last month and later in an online column for the Washington Post.

She explained that in 1985, she was 17 and an aspiring actress when Cosby 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times'.

Cosby, who was never criminally charged in any case, settled a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years before.

On Sunday, Cosby's lawyer said he will not dignify 'decade-old, discredited' claims of sexual abuse with a response.

John P. Schmitt said the fact that the allegations are being repeated 'does not make them true.' 

Silence: Bill Cosby, pictured with his wife Camille on November 6, refused to answer questions about the allegations when the couple were being interviewed by NPR this weekend

Support: Legendary saxophonist Tony Williams, pictured front with Cosby, has stood up for his long-time friend, saying that he believes that the alleged victims are going after the comedian's fame and fortune

'He would like to thank all his fans for the outpouring of support and assure them that, at age 77, he is doing his best work,' Schmitt said.  

Also at the weekend, Cosby stonewalled National Public Radio host Scott Simon during an interview with Cosby and his wife, Camille, about their African-American art collection.

Cosby fell silent when asked by Simon about 'serious allegations raised about you in recent days'.

'You're shaking your head, no,' the host said. 'Do you have any response to those charges? Shaking your head, no.'

Legendary saxophonist, Tony Williams, has also defended his friend, saying he is angry that the claims have resurfaced again and believes the women are just after Cosby's fame and money.

'No, No. He don't have to rape anybody,' Williams told Fox Philly  29 in an interview on Sunday.
