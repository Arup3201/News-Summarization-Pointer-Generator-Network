The latest episode of Game of Thrones shocked viewers with the brutal slaughter of multiple characters - but the creator of the series has insisted that the bloodbath was in fact based on historical events.

Fans of the HBO series were horrified to see some of their favourites murdered at a wedding, and some have accused writer George R.R. Martin of going over the top with the extraordinary scenes.

However Martin, author of the books on which the series is based, has revealed that the 'Red Wedding' was intended to reflect historical reality.

It was based on two tragic moments in Scottish history when feasts turned into fights - one of which was the Black Dinner of 1440 at Edinburgh Castle, when the host killed his own guest after serving him with the ominous head of a black bull.

True story?: A still from the 'Red Wedding' episode of 'Game of Thrones.' The show's creator says the bloody scene came from historical fact

For diehard viewers of Game of Thrones, one of the most shocking elements of last Sunday's episode was seeing the 'hospitality laws' broken when the Frey family turned against their guests, the Starks.

These laws state that once people have broken bread with one another, they are forbidden from harming each other - and this custom was not invented by Martin himself.

‘It was stolen from history,’ he said in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.
‘Hospitality laws were real in Dark Ages society. A host and guest were
not allowed to harm each other even if they were enemies. By violating 
that law, the phrase is, they “condemn themselves for all time.”’

'Edinburgh Castle, toune and towre,God grant thou sink for sin!And that e'en for the black dinnerEarl Douglas gat therein.'

The 'Red Wedding' scene in Game of Thrones, which even shows the slaughter of a pregnant queen, may seem to be a particularly violent example of this type of treachery, but Martin copied it from the medieval past.

‘The Red Wedding is based on a couple real events from Scottish history,’ Martin explained.

At the Black Dinner, in November 1440, the 16-year-old Earl of Douglas was invited to Edinburgh Castle by Sir William Crichton, who as Chancellor of Scotland was a leading member of the court of 10-year-old King James II.

Crichton feared the brothers Douglas and their allies were becoming too powerful.

So he brought in the men to eat and drink until the king's men began ominously pounding drums.

Shameful past: Unlike the Black Dinner, it was the guests who killed the hosts in 'The game of Thrones' Red Wedding. But the fictional and historical violence remains the same

Gory: The bloody scene of treachery shocked many fans

The head of a black bull or boar was served - a sign that death is near.

The king's men then dragged the Earl and 
his followers out of the castle into the courtyard. After a mock trial 
that found them guilty of high treason, they were beheaded.

Martin says he also based his equally loathed and beloved scene on another, more widely known instance of Middle Ages brutality.

‘The larger instance was the Glencoe Massacre,’ he explained, where one Scottish clan slaughtered another.

Half crazy: But George R.R. Martin says the carnage came from Scottish history, not just his imagination

As The Week tells it, the MacDonalds 
had until a prescribed date to swear allegiance to the new king, William
of Orange. But the letter they sent to do so, due to bureaucratic 
mishandling and a secretary of state who had a bone to pick against 
the clan, didn't make it in time.

The Campbells, under the command of Captain Robert Campbell visited the MacDonalds at Glencoe in 1692. Clan Campbell, Martin explained, stayed with Clan MacDonald, so the laws of hospitality were supposed to apply but were quickly - and murderously - ignored.

The clans played cards together and 
then the MacDonalds fell asleep. As they dozed, the vengeful Campbells 
killed 38 of them in their beds. Some 40 women and children escaped, 
only to perish in the blizzard that raged that night.

Though
Martin has said the ‘Red Wedding’ scene lost him a great many readers 
and that even he had trouble watching it in television form, he has defended the bloodshed by insisting that he is only reflected the dark side of human nature, as recorded throughout history.

‘No matter how much I make up,’ he said, ‘there’s stuff in history that’s just as bad, or worse.’
