Jose Mourinho has declared a desire to keep both Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech at Chelsea this season even though he accepts he will soon have to make one of them extremely unhappy.

The Chelsea manager watched Cech make an impressive return from a serious shoulder injury in a pre-season friendly here against RZ Pellets WAC after young French striker Jeremie Boga cancelled out Silvio De Oliveira’s opener for the hosts. 

But Cech faces a serious threat to his place for the first time in a decade at Stamford Bridge, with Courtois the favourite to start against Burnley in Chelsea’s Premier League opener on August 18. Courtois does not report for training until July 30 but the Belgian international was outstanding for Atletico Madrid last season and impressed in the World Cup too.

It leaves Mourinho with a difficult call to make. ‘My situation for the season is fantastic,’ said Mourinho. ‘To have Cech and Courtois, the best young goalkeeper in the world and one of the top three or five experienced keepers, for me and Chelsea it’s perfect.

‘There’s no story. One will play and Chelsea will be in safe hands for good because both are very good players.’

When it was then pointed out to Mourinho that one would be left unhappy, he said: ‘But the Chelsea supporters will be happy and they’re more important than players. If supporters have Cech or Courtois they will be happy because they know we’re in safe hands.

‘The window is the window but I’m so happy with the situation. For a coach the problem is when you don’t have good players. Then we’re in trouble.

‘We have to make decisions but we’re paid to make them and I’m really happy with the situation.

'Tonight the game for Petr was perfect because he had difficult situations to deal with. He had the cross at the far post where he had to stretch his shoulder, another where he had to punch under contact, one off the floor to test his shoulder. He had situations he needed. He’s shown that completely recovered.’
