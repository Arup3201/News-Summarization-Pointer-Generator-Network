Spanish naval officers are facing jail for allegedly shipping more than 127kg cocaine from Colombia to New York on a training ship.

Three sailors were arrested in July following a US operation but the stash - hidden among candles in a storeroom - was not uncovered until today.

Investigations started in May this year after New York police seized 20kg of cocaine from two Colombians in the city. 

Under interrogation, they revealed it had been shipped by the Juan Sebastian Elcano, which serves as a floating embassy for Spain.

The crew was paid to transport the drug after being ambushed by the a gang of drug traffickers when they docked in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, during a six-month tour, reports claim.

Each sailor was allegedly issued with a portion of the drug to hide before setting off for the United States. 

A major international operation was launched between the Spanish Civil Guard and US Homeland Security Investigations when 20kg of the stash was seized in New York in mid-May.

When it docked in Bueu, Pontevedra, north west Spain, on July 12, militia stormed the ship, arresting three sailors - one Ecuadorian and two Spaniards.

Since the operation started in May, the 1927 ship has hosted a number of high-ranking dignitaries, Spanish defence ministers, and 69 trainees from the Spanish navy. 

The investigation is ongoing.
