A surfer who was racially abused by a
 stand-up paddle boarder and told to ‘f*** off back to England’ has 
described the tirade of verbal abuse he received as ‘disgusting’.

Longboarder
 Phil Brown, 29, caught the astonishing incident on camera which saw him
 subjected to the abuse after he accidentally caught the same wave as 
the stand-up paddle (SUP) boarder.

The
 footage shows the SUP rider, who had a Saint Piran's Flag – the flag of
 Cornwall – sticker stuck to the front of his board, launch a number of 
expletives at Mr Brown during the surf session on Saturday.

In the video the SUP 
boarder can be heard shouting: ‘You drop in on me like that again and 
you won’t f*****g surf here again. It’s my wave, keep your f*****g eyes 
open.’

To which Mr Brown, of Bude, Cornwall, can be heard responding: ‘There’s no need to swear.’

However, the unknown SUP boarder then shouts: ‘Don’t tell me not to f*****g swear – you nearly caused me an accident then.

‘I was on the wave. Don’t do it again. Do it again and I will put you in f*****g hospital and that’s a promise.

‘Don’t act like a t**t in the water.’

However, despite Mr Brown apologising, the man continues to hurl abuse and exclaims: ‘F*** off back to England you ****.’

Despite
 Mr Brown pointing out that he is in fact from Cornwall, the man – who 
appears to have a strong Liverpudlian accent - responds: ‘I was born 
here’.

Mr Brown can 
then be heard telling the man it ‘gives him no more right’ but is met by
 a response of ‘f*** off’ by the SUP rider who then paddles off.

The incident, which occurred off Summerleaze Beach in Bude, Cornwall, has left Mr Brown ‘wary of going back into the water’.

He said: ‘I think he’s bang out of order for the way he spoke to me and the localism he used as well.

‘It’s inappropriate - it shouldn’t be used in any way, shape or form.

‘I’ve heard he’s quite renowned for saying these kinds of things to other people in the water. I’ve heard of at least a handful of people saying the same thing has happened to them.

‘It’s disgusting and it’s just not right.

‘It’s the same as racism. It’s exactly the same thing just in a different manner.

‘I am a bit wary to get back in the water now to be honest. I think I’ll go to a different beach now to avoid him.’

The
 former Army serviceman and keen surfer added: ‘I was quite shocked. 
Everyone in Cornwall is pretty laid back – you don’t get that kind of 
thing usually so to receive that from him was one hell of a shock.

‘I told him I’m from Cornwall but he comes across as if it is his water and almost as if he classes me as a holidaymaker.

‘It shouldn’t make any difference where I’m from - it’s the same water.’

Mr Brown, who served eight years in the Army working in The Queen's Royal Hussars on a battle tank Challenger Two – and was deployed to Afghanistan – said other locals have also been left shocked by the incident.

He
 said: ‘They all think it’s disgusting the way he was talking to me. 
There’s no real reason for anyone to talk to anyone else like that.

‘It made me feel horrible and I didn’t appreciate the way he was talking to me.

‘I’ve had suggestions that I should go to the police about it but I don’t really want to go down the formal line.

‘I’m not spiteful and I don’t wish the guy harm, I just want him to know I’m unhappy and I want an apology.’

Mr
 Brown also said he was left confused by the man’s comment telling him 
to ‘f*** off back to England’ and said there was no need for localism.

He said: ‘I don’t know if he’s from Cornwall - he has a broad Liverpuddlian accent - but he said at the time “I was born here”.

‘I don’t know what his views are but I certainly don’t think of Cornwall is its own country or anything like that.

‘I know there’s some good old rivalry between Devon and Cornwall but that’s just banter.’

Phil Brown, centre, said he accidentally caught the same wave as the paddle boarder. He said: 'I didn't realise that if someone is closer to the point of the wave breaking then it's classed as their wave'

It’s
 unclear what the SUP boarder meant by his racist comment but it appears
 he holds the view that Cornwall is a separate entity to England and 
that it should be classed as a different country.

Despite
 his strong northern accent, the black and white Saint Piran’s flag can 
be seen stuck to the front of his paddle board which is used by some 
Cornish people as a symbol of identity.

The
 view that Cornwall is separate from the rest of England is a view which
 is long-held by several people from the county, who regard the ‘Kernow’
 as distinctly separate from the rest of the British Isles. 

A
 minority believe the Cornish should be considered a separate race or 
nation, with their own language, society and customs which is distinct 
from the neighbouring mainland.

Mr
 Brown, who now manages a brewery in the county, said the whole incident
 was an accident on his part and said he just wants an apology from the 
SUP boarder.

The incident, which occurred off Summerleaze Beach in Bude, Cornwall, has left keen surfer Phil Brown, pictured, 'wary of going back into the water'

He said: 
‘I started surfing properly last summer and I didn’t realise that if 
someone is closer to the point of the wave breaking then it’s classed as
 their wave.

‘What I 
did wasn’t dangerous - there was no one in front of us - so there’s no 
reason for him to have said it would’ve created an accident.

‘I’ve
 never seen the guy before in my life, let alone surfed with him before,
 but there was such a distance between us that it shouldn’t have been a 
problem.

‘Apparently I 
was in the wrong but after the wave he seemed quite happy at first until
 he paddled across to me and had a right bl**dy go at me.

‘But to be honest I just want an apology and to shake the guys hand and move on.’

The Saint Piran's Flag is the Cornish flag and is attributed to Saint Piran - a 6th Century Cornish abbot

Saint Piran's Flag is the flag of Cornwall.

It is a white cross on a black background and is used by some Cornish people as a symbol of identity.

It can be found raised outside many homes in Cornwall as well as on car bumper stickers, bunting, t-shirts and tax disc holders.

The flag is attributed to Saint Piran - a 6th century Cornish abbot and saint. One early use of the white cross and black background design was the 15th century coat of arms of the Saint-Peran family.

The earliest known description of the flag was written in 1835.

At the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant in June 2012, the flag was among those flown on the Royal Barge, Gloriana.

Saint Piran's Day - the national day of Cornwall - falls on March 5 annually and is celebrated in the county most notably with parades and processions, ceremonies of raising the flag, shop decorations and family entertainment.

In 2006 Cornish MP Dan Rogerson asked the government to make March 5 a public holiday in Cornwall to recognise St Piran's Day celebrations.

Since then, several employers mark the day by giving their staff a day off to honour ‘St Piran's Day Holiday’.
