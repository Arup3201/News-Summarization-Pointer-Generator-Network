Following a relatively lukewarm reception to its latest handsets, and reports that the larger iPhone 6 Plus bends when stored in a back pocket, Apple has now been forced to pull its latest software update.

Users began reporting overnight that the upgrade to iOS 8.0.1 robbed them of signal, data service and the Touch ID capability.

This is the second major issue to arise with Apple's newest iPhone since it was launched on Friday - making it the most troubled new product release since the iPhone 4 and 'antennagate.'

Brand new and already broken: Apple iOS 8.0.1, which was released today, cut cell and data service to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models (pictured) when installed

However, the company acted quickly to pull iOS 8.0.1 from the Apple store when users began reporting the problems within minutes of its release.

The glitch appears to affect only the newest iPhones - not iPhone 5C or 5S, or older models. 

Apple users on networks across the US, Britain and Canada were reporting problems via Twitter and official support forums after updating their operating systems,MacRumors.com reported. 

Apple’s iOS 8.0.1 was designed to fix a number of glitches with the iOS 8 software.

These included a bug that meant the release of HealthKit apps were delayed, an issue with third-party keyboards, a bug that stopped some apps accessing the photo library, reliability and usability of Apple's Reachability feature, an issue where ringtones were not being restored following iCloud backups, and a problem that could cause ‘unexpected cellular data usage when receiving SMS/MMS messages.’

For many, the update solved many of these issues, but in exchange, caused the TouchID fingerprint scanner to fail, as well as create the loss of data services on networks across the US, UK and Canada.

The bug appears to only be affecting the newest iPhones.

To restore a phone to a previous version of the software, as an alternative to waiting for Apple's next update, follow these steps, taken from Apple's support pages.

1. Make sure that you're using the latest version of iTunes.

2. Connect your iPhone to iTunes, using the Lightning cable. 

3. Back up your iPhone in iTunes on your Mac or PC. iCloud backups won't restore to earlier versions, including iOS 8.0.

4. Download the relevant files for the device that is affected - the iPhone 6 or the iPhone 6 Plus.

5. Select the file by either pressing the Option key and click Check for Update, if using a Mac, or the Shift key and click Check for Update on a PC. 

6. Press Update to install iOS 8 on your iPhone.

The Health app won't work in iOS 8 after these steps. It will be fixed in Apple's upcoming iOS 8.0.2 software update.

People who have only downloaded the update but not installed it yet, there is a way to delete it from the device.

1. Go to Settings, General, Usage and Manage Storage.

2. Select iOS 8.0.1

3. Tap Delete Update, and tap Delete Update again to confirm. 

Apple announced it was investigating the glitch, but in the meantime recommended that owners of affected iPhones restore their devices by connecting to iTunes.

In an official statement, the tech giant said: 'We apologise for the great inconvenience experienced by users, and are working around the clock to prepare iOS 8.0.2 with a fix for the issue.'

Angry users took to Twitter to report the bug and vent their frustrations. 

One user wrote: 'iOS 8.0.1 has broken my phone! No service and no touchid. #apple #Help #iOS8 #ios8bugs.'

'I would call Apple for an answer on this issue. But hang on I can't. NO SERVICE!!!' another said. 

New iPhone 6 users revealed that their phones bent after just a few hours in a pocket. Apple has refused to comment on the issue

This weekend, some iPhone 6 Plus users reported that their devices bent after just a few hours in their pockets. Apple has declined to comment on this particular issue. 

This is not the first time Apple's phones have been dogged by faults. 

Shortly after the iPhone 4 launched in 2012, customers struggled to get signal when the phone was held on the lower left edge of the frame.

Apple issued a statement advising customers should 'avoid gripping [the phone] in the lower left corner' when making or receiving a call, which was met with even more complaints.

The firm later released a software update to fix the problem, as well as offering customers free cases that Steve Jobs said at the time would also solve the issue.

A small number of owners even sued the firm, and received $15 (£9) settlement checks. 

The iPhone 4S was then dogged with battery problems, and some users reported issues with a yellow tint on the display. 

It is believed the thinner model, in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the phone to deform.

A video, uploaded to YouTube by user Lewis Hilsenteger on his channel Unbox Therapy, shows the 5.5-inch model bending using just his fingers.

It has already achieved more than 18.5 million views.  

Mr Hilsenteger has since released a follow up, in which he put Apple's main rival's handsets through the same 'bend' test. 

The Moto X was the most durable, the Nokia Lumia 1020 cracked but didn't bend, and the screen of the HTC One popped out. 

And even BlackBerry - a company that is lagging seriously behind Apple and Samsung in terms of marketshare - made reference to Apple's woes. 

During the launch event for its latest square Passport device, chief executive John Chen said: 'I would challenge you guys to bend our Passport.'

Despite the problems, the newest iteration of the iPhone broke records over the weekend - selling 10 million models after its release on Friday.

The larger screens beat the previous record of 9 million for the iPhone 5S and 5C in 2013. 

It was also met with a huge amount of praise from critics, who labelled it 'the best smartphone ever', and paid particular attention to the luxurious nature of the design and usefulness of the new features.  

Apple stock dropped slightly in response to the report, by less than 1 percent in after-hours trading.
