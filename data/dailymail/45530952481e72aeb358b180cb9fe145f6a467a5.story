Bulgarians and Romanians will flock to Britain in far greater numbers than forecast as our economy races ahead of the rest of Europe, a secret report predicts.

After immigration controls are lifted this week, Britons could find their jobs are squeezed in some areas – while community tensions could rise as the new wave of migrants fight for work with other Eastern Europeans who have been settled in Britain for a decade, it suggests.

The Home Office-funded review – obtained by The Mail on Sunday – also suggests that the UK could lose out financially if low-paid Bulgarians and Romanians drive out Poles on higher wages, who pay more tax.

From Wednesday, Bulgarians and Romanians, known as A2 migrants, will have the same rights as other EU citizens to live and work throughout Europe, but Britain is likely to be seen as more attractive than other countries struggling to make an economic comeback.

The authoritative report by University of Reading academics was  commissioned ahead of the change by a group of 74 councils in the South East of England, working with the UK Border Agency, police and health services, but has not been officially publicised.

Obtained under a Freedom of Information request, the 40-page report reveals that migration overall was likely to be beneficial to the UK but warns that:

Already overcrowded schools will struggle to find places for the children of the new arrivals.

Overstretched hospitals risk coming under fresh strain, and the housing crisis could get worse.

The cost to taxpayers of state handouts, such as Child Benefit, could go up.

Town halls may fail to collect enough council tax from new immigrants to pay for the extra services because they often crowd into one home and have ‘makeshift accommodation arrangements’.

The Government has refused to say how many Romanians and Bulgarians it expects to come. The new report also gives no figures but suggests the recent growth in jobs in Britain, and lengthening dole queues elsewhere in Europe, will encourage more to come here than might be anticipated on previous trends.

The study drawn up for the South East Strategic Partnership for Migration says that immigration restrictions ‘are ending when employment across the EU is changing,’ which could have an impact on migration patterns. 

Bulgarians and Romanians could compete for the jobs of previous immigrants such as Poles

Significantly, it adds: ‘Against this 
background it is feasible the UK might receive a larger share of A2 
migrants than in the recent past.’

It
 says a crucial issue is whether Bulgarians and Romanians think 
Britain’s economic revival is here to stay – if so, it will have ‘a 
greater impact on migration patterns’.

Our financial turnaround may well be long term. Last week, one forecast predicted the UK economy will outstrip France by 2018 and Germany 12 years later.

The authors of the £5,000 Reading university report, Christian Nygaard and Ellie Francis-Brophy, say there is little evidence Eastern European migrants take jobs from British workers overall, though this will ‘vary across localities’.

But since 2004, when Poland and seven other East European countries – the so-called A8 – won full rights within the EU, ‘the employment rate of UK-born 16 to 64-year-old residents in the South East has fallen somewhat whereas that of not UK-born other white residents has increased somewhat.’ 

Worryingly, the report also raises the prospect of tensions between Bulgarians and Romanians on one side and the first wave of Eastern European immigrants on the other.

It speculates that lower skilled Romanians and Bulgarians could undercut existing Polish migrants – with damaging consequences for community relations, and potentially the economy, especially if newly unemployed Poles sign on.

Igor Kaminski, who has a Polish building firm in London, said: ‘There’s a lot of fear the cheaper end of the market will collapse under pressure from Bulgarians and Romanian workers who, for a short time, will accept any prices.’

THE VIEW FROM HERE: 'I CAME FROM ROMANIA TO WORK, BUT UNSKILLED MIGRANTS ARE A WORRY'

By Simon Walters

Talented student Marius Petrea, who came to Britain last year to  pursue his dream of becoming an airline pilot, shares worries that some of his fellow countrymen about to arrive here may not improve his country’s image.

Mr Petrea, 27, says he believes many Romanians will take advantage of the relaxation in immigration rules, including some with few skills or qualifications.

Mr Petrea, who has a Masters degree in English, was allowed to settle here before the rule change under  exemptions for highly skilled immigrants. He is the model of a bright, hard-working young person who left his native country to seek a better life abroad.

‘I am very proud of my country and came here because I am ambitious,’ said Mr Petrea, who works as a minicab driver, regularly working seven days a week. ‘Quite a lot of Romanians will come here because there are jobs in Britain. I am a little worried that some may live up to Romania’s image as having a low-skilled workforce.

‘That would be wrong because most young people in Romania are educated, hard-working, have strong characters and could have a positive effect in Britain. Many want to come here to earn enough money to educate their own children.’

No one could call Mr Petrea low-skilled. His fluent English reflects the Masters degree he obtained in Romania. He paid for private tuition in maths and physics to improve his chances of achieving his dream of becoming a pilot and is determined to raise the six figure sum he needs to train to get his wings.

‘I will not give up until I have done it,’ he says.

THE VIEW FROM THERE: ON THEIR WAY: 34 CRAM INTO A NINE-SEATER BUS

By Martin Delgado

Bulgarians and Romanians are planning to share car journeys or cram vehicles to come to Britain.

The rush to migrate was illustrated just before Christmas when a minibus designed for nine people was stopped in the Bavarian city of Passau. It contained 34 Romanians who had left Bucharest en route for an unspecified western country. The vehicle was impounded.

Forums on Romanian websites are carrying inquiries from people wanting to share cars or find out the price of petrol for a trip across Europe.

It is feared that when they get to the UK, they could elbow British graduates out of the job market.

Bulgaria and Romania have a large number of highly qualified IT specialists, entrepreneurs, aspiring lawyers and accountants and many of them speak good English and other languages.

Barbara Page-Roberts, a British businesswoman who has lived and worked in Bulgaria since 1985, said: ‘I’ve met young Bulgarians who speak four or five languages. It gives them a flexibility and adaptability that most British job seekers lack.’

Gabriela Milanove, 24, wants a job in digital marketing or web development, but is in no hurry to rush to the UK.

With a degree from a Bulgarian University and another from Cardiff Metropolitan University, she said she would like to return to the UK, but not until the furore over so-called ‘benefits tourism’ has died down.

She said: ‘Britain doesn’t really want us at the moment. People there think we will be taking their jobs. But I would go if I had a firm offer or a contract.’

Another would-be migrant, Dobrin Dobrev, 36, who speaks English, Russian and some German and French, plans to set up a telecoms consultancy in Britain.

He said: ‘I wouldn’t say I am better than a British person but I have travelled to many countries and I am very familiar with Eastern Europe, which has an expanding telecoms market.’

Residents of Maidstone in Kent, identified as having one of the highest concentrations of Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants in the South East, said they feared already oversubscribed schools and hospitals will fail to cope with more demand.

Sharon McNeil, 53, said: ‘There’s no room at the schools or extra places. The services are stretched. At my doctor’s surgery you can’t get an appointment for at least two weeks.’ The Reading University report says the impact of migration on public services will be limited ‘in the short run’ because most new arrivals will be young people looking for work, though ‘existing pressure points are likely to be stretched further’.

But there will be an impact on schools as one in three Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants are expected to have school-age children – and one in four will have babies – within four years of arriving.

Migration Watch’s Sir Andrew Green said: ‘The clear conclusion of this report is that we can expect further migration from Romania and Bulgaria next year. However, they duck the key question of numbers.’

South East Strategic Partnership for Migration manager Roy Millard said the report was designed to assist councils with their planning rather than making firm predictions. He said there were no suggestions that there might be violence but ‘there can be resentments within communities when there is competition for resources’.

Meanwhile, councils outside of the South-East have expressed concerns in internal documents, obtained by The Mail on Sunday.

Leeds council said increased pressures on housing could lead to growing homelessness, and that both Bulgaria and Romania had high levels of diseases such as tuberculosis, mumps, measles and rubella.

Manchester City Council highlighted concerns over its Roma community, saying there were high rates of truancy and teenage pregnancy.  Residents also complained that Roma households ‘appeared to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle without appearing to work’.

Despite the fears, virtually no councils have drawn up plans to deal with the expected influx of Romanians and Bulgarians. One exception was Kent, which estimated that the new arrivals could cost it £3 million in extra services, including 390 extra primary school places, though that would be outweighed by the benefit to the economy.

David Cameron has announced controversial plans for curbs on benefits and a review of EU freedom of movement laws to end ‘vast migrations’ from poorer European countries.
