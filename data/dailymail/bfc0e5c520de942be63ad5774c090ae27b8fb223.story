A West End play which opened this week claims Princess Diana was pregnant with Dodi Fayed's child when she died in the Paris car crash.

Controversial theories surrounding the Princess's life, and death, are raised in new 'factional' production Truth, Lies, Diana, which had its opening night in London on Friday.

Among allegations aired in the show, which is centred on a fictional playwright investigating Diana's death, are claims she was pregnant with a 'Muslim baby' when she died on August 31, 1997.

Jon Conway, who also directs and appears in the show, wrote the play using transcripts from the inquest into the Princess's death, leaked official documents and interviews with her former lover James Hewitt and butler Paul Burrell.

Both are depicted in the play, which also features actors playing Dodi's father Mohammed Al-Fayed and Piers Morgan, as well as other members of the Royal family - although Diana herself is not seen on stage.

Claims the Princess was pregnant were dismissed by at the inquest, but the play includes details from a testimony  Conway says was given to him by the ex-girlfriend of a doctor at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital where Diana was formally declared dead.

In the play, 'Rose', a British forensic officer, is seen claiming the doctor, 'Yasser', had called another health worker on the night Diana died.

'Yasser said to him in Arabic, "I can’t believe the news. Were you on duty?" Then he said, "Yes, yes... What? She was pregnant?", she says in the play, according to the Sunday Mirror's Patrick Hill.

'The other doctor told Yasser he saw the foetus and was told never to mention it. Yasser said, "Yes, imagine that, the King of England’s mother, pregnant with a Muslim baby".'

When asked why she and Yasser had not spoken out at the time of Diana's death because to protect their careers, but says she feels it is now time for 'the truth'.

The play, which runs at the Charing Cross theatre until February 14, also includes claims  by Hewitt that Diana had discovered Prince Charles was having an affair with Camilla Parker Bowles days before their 1981 wedding, and had wanted to cancel the ceremony.

Hewitt, who has given his blessing to his depiction in the show, is also seen claiming Diana knew that Prince Philip had alleged flings, but that he and the Queen had 'an arrangement'.

Conway appears as writer Ray in the play, which has been described as 'semi-autobiographical' and 'factional', as well as playing Burrell - who has famously referred to himself as the Princess's 'rock'.  

Mohammed Al-Fayed, Morgan and Yasser are played by actor Barry Hester, while former Hollyoaks and Footballers' Wives star Kim Tiddy plays Ray's wife, an actress who helps with his research and reads out some of Diana's quotes as part of the story.

A summary of the show on its website states: 'A playwright uncovers secrets about Diana and her death, that the establishment have tried to keep hidden. As he does, his own life starts to unravel and he becomes paranoid, suspecting the wife he is devoted to, is being unfaithful.

'Is Ray being manipulated by the ‘men in grey’ that Diana had always maintained existed, or does no-one in their right mind believe Diana was murdered?' 

Conway  said: 'I think it’s important the public is able to hear the whole story. I call it the D-word as nobody wants to talk about it.'

In a question and answer piece on Conway's website, he was asked 'why drag this up again now?'

'The last three years has seen dramatic reinvestigations into many old crimes, exposing covers and corruption in the past,' he said. 

'Jimmy Savile, Steven Lawrence, phone hacking and so on, have vindicated witnesses previously presented as unreliable. None more relevant than the opening of a new Hillsborough inquest. This happened after the Police admitted they altered over 100 witness statements. Yet any questions about Diana’s death are swept aside or met with a wall of silence.'

Respected Royal author Margaret Holder has described the claims in the play as a 'nonsense'.

She said: 'I think this will put him back in the spotlight and it tells producers of reality TV programmes, “Hello, I’m here.” It’s a nonsense but it’s all a game.'

Biographer Hugo Vickers said the play’s claims were not surprising given the people who had been interviewed by Conway.

He said: ‘If you talk to certain people you will get a version of events these people are keen to peddle. They have an agenda of their own.’ 

The play had its opening night on Friday and runs at the Charing Cross theatre until February 14
