Alan Pardew is the toast of Tyneside after Newcastle’s resurgence extended to four straight wins – and the manager was even planning a rare night on the town.

The 53-year-old was left clinging to his job after a run of seven games without victory from the start of the season. One website – SackPardew.com – even attempted to mobilise fans to protest against his employment.

But the 1-0 triumph over Liverpool marked a third win on the spin in the Premier League and came on the back of the midweek success at Manchester City in the League Cup.

Newcastle manager Alan Pardew celebrates as his side beat Liverpool 1-0 at St James' Park

Ayoze Perez scored the only goal for the Magpies in a result which takes them to four straight wins

Perez is a player that has excited Newcastle fans, and Pardew praised his player after the match

Fans even held a ‘BackPardew.com’ banner in support of their boss, and Pardew, who celebrates four years at the club next month, reflected: ‘If you are Newcastle manager it is not all gin and tonics and aperitifs. There will be rough days.

‘We have had a long four years. We have had some success and some of that has got forgotten, but I have always enjoyed it here.

‘I love the city and I enjoy the job. I would like to think I am coming out of this a better manager. It has been interesting and educational. It tests you, this football club, on a number of levels.

‘But our fans are brilliant. It will be fantastic in the town tonight. I might even go in myself – for the first time for a while.

‘That is what this city is about. It loves football. When it does not go well they let you know and when it is going well, they let you know - you take the good with the bad.’

And Pardew praised goalscorer Ayoze Perez, the £1.5million summer signing from Tenerife who was also last weekend’s match-winner at Spurs and collected two individual awards in Spain earlier this week.

‘He has a knack,’ he said. ‘He has a lot to learn about the English Premier League but you know that if something falls for him he will score.

‘You sometimes get a player who can do it in training but not on a matchday, but he has had a fabulous week. Two awards in Spanish football and a great week here.’
