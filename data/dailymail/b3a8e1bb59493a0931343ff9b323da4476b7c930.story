When you slick on your mascara and dab on your blusher in a hurry in the morning do you ever stop to think about the consequences it could be having on your heath?

One outspoken beauty guru believes that the products we put on our skin could be damaging our immune system, causing yeast infections and even giving us panic attacks.

In the same way that we care about what food we put into our mouths, Rose-Marie Swift maintains the same thought-process should go into our beauty regime before it's too late.

Miranda Kerr's beauty guru Rose-Marie Swift believes she fell ill at the hands of 'toxic' products 

The make-up artist, who works with Miranda Kerr, sticks by the mantra: 'the skin is a mirror to your gut', and she speaks from first-hand experience. 

The self-confessed beauty junkie tried out all sorts of skincare and make-up through work but as the years went by, she started to lose her hair, memory and, at times, she couldn't remember what she had done the day before. 

'I had panic and anxiety attacks continually and my hormones were out of control. I found myself getting sicker and weaker and could not get a proper night's sleep at all,' she writes on her website.

'My body was in a constant struggle with candidiasis - a yeast infection throughout my whole body. For years, traditional doctors told me there was nothing wrong, until I finally ended up in the hospital with a completely weakened immune system.'

She finally took responsibility for her own health and paid for some very extensive - and expensive - lab work. When one specialist asked her: 'do you work in the cosmetics industry?', something clicked.

She said: 'I was dumbfounded to learn that make-up and skincare products could cause serious health issues. Sure, companies advertise how their products make us look, but why doesn't anybody tell us how they can make us feel?' 

Her tests showed that she had toxic levels of the heavy metals lead, cadmium, aluminum, barium and mercury. She also had high levels of pesticides and many other chemicals in her system. The lab even said to her: 'we can't believe you're even walking around.'

As a result of her ordeal, several cleanses, and studying nutrition, Rose-Marie launched her a blog, Beautytruth.com, devoted to exposing the use of chemicals in cosmetics, which she believed was to blame for her ill health. 

She went on to launch her own organic skincare and make-up range, RMS Beauty, which landed in Urban Retreat in Harrods in November.

Rose-Marie believes that ingredients in shampoos, hair dyes, and other everyday products may be playing havoc with our hormones that control reproduction. 'We are polluting our physical form and altering our cell structure with this constant chemical assault,' she writes on her blog. 

She prides herself on  creating a product that's not only non-toxic, but that actually heals and nourishes skin. 

'I was surprised to learn that the majority of ingredients used for natural cosmetics are refined, bleached, deodorized, clarified, fractionated and heated to high temperatures. But this means they are not pure natural ingredients anymore - they are now equivalent to man-made chemicals.

'No matter how hard the beauty business proclaims innocence, the undeniable truth is that many of the ingredients in make-up and skincare are toxic to our bodies. It’s time to uncover some beauty truths.' 

She explains that her products are formulated with raw, food grade and organic ingredients in their natural state, all the things her friend and client Miranda loves

Rose's products, which cost around £30 each, include the living luminizer, left, which aims to highlight skin and is loved by Emma Watson, and the beauty oil, right, which she says contains only the finest exotic oils and rare herbal extracts

'I consider it my responsibility to share my personal experience and knowledge about these chemicals in our cosmetic' skincare products so that you too can make informed decisions about your own health and beauty,' she said. 

She explains that her products are formulated with raw, food grade and organic ingredients in their natural state, allowing their living, healing attributes to penetrate and rejuvenate the skin. 

'In their purest form, enzymes, vitamins, antioxidants and their healing properties remain fully intact, encouraging amazing potential for anti-aging effects,' she claims.

Celebrity fans of her range, which uses ingredients such as coconut oil, cocoa butter, bees wax, rosehip oil and vanilla extract, include supermodels Gisele Bundchen, Miranda Kerr and Karlie Kloss.

She concludes: 'We can all have healthy, radiant, beautiful lives if we know the truth.'
