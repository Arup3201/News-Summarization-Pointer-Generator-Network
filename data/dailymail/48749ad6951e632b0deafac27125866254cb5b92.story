Racegoers at Kempton Park on Boxing Day will not only see five-time King George VI Chase winner Kauto Star paraded but also the unveiling of a specially commissioned statue to mark his remarkable record in the race.

The sculpture, by Charlie Langton, is sited in the Parade Ring and is the culmination of eight months work.

Langton said: ‘The over life-size sculpture took around three and half months to sculpt. I used over a ton of clay over the top of a steel framework.

‘I also sought the advice of John Francome, who very kindly spared his time to come and see the sculpture developing.

‘Once we were happy with the clay version, it was moulded over the course of 10 days and then cast in bronze.

‘The casting took about four months, so combined with the sculpting time, the piece took about eight months to complete (or about 900 hours).’

Kauto Star had a career spanning nine years and is widely heralded as one of the finest steeplechasers of all time.

His five King Georges is one more than the great Desert Orchid, whose statue stands just outside the Kempton parade ring.
