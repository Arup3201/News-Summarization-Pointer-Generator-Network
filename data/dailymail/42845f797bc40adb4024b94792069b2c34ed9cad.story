The daughter of a woman involved in a Satanic sex cult has revealed her evil mother made her sleep with 1,800 men by the time she was 18.

The woman, who has called herself Annabelle Forest, was initiated into the sick cult after having to watch her mother perform a sex act on the cult's ringleader Colin Batley at the age of seven. 

At 11 she was raped twice by the man, and three years later made to take part in group sex with her mother at their home near Llanelli in Wales, where at least two other households on the street took part in cult activity.

Colin Batley and Jacqueline Marling were jailed for systemically sexually abusing the girl as she was growing up. 

Batley's wife Elaine was also convicted of sexually assaulting a child alongside Sheila Millar, a prostitute who is thought to have frequented Batley's house. 

A 2011 trial at Swansea Crown Court heard how Batley, who was married at the time and lived on the same street in a different house, wore hooded robes and chanted before having group sex with the women and children. 

Snakes would be kept near an 'altar' in his lounge where residents on the quiet cul-de-sac would congregate on Sunday evenings.  

Now settled with her own family, Annabelle has spoken out against Batley and her mother who were sentenced to at least 11 years and 12 years imprisonment respectively. 

'Nothing can hurt me as much as my mum and that man. My mother was an evil woman and I'll never forgive her,' she said. 

'To be abused like that by your own mum beggars belief.' 

In her recently released memoir, Annabelle reveals she had slept with almost 2,000 men by her 18th birthday after being forced in to prostitution to raise money for the cult's 'church'.

The couple's twisted ideology was based on the Book of the Law by Aleister Crowley, and made children  believe they were proving themselves to god by having sex with other members, all the while egged on by Batley, now 48.

House of horrors: The girl was forced to endure years of sexual abuse at the house in Wales where Batley taught her and other children  that passing sexual 'tests' would please God

Batley and his bisexual wife Elaine invited neighbours from the cul-de-sac round to their home where Annabelle and other children were suffered horrendous sexual abuse

'I was 11 when he first raped me - the worst thing about it was the fact that he made me think I was doing it out of choice,' she said. 

Colin Batley was jailed in 2011 after sexually abusing children for decades

'It was awful. The most painful and shocking thing that had ever happened - but it was my path, that's what he told me, and if I didn't do it I would go to the Abyss, which was our version of hell.

'Colin knew how to manipulate you, to make you believe anything he said.'

'We weren't even allowed to look in his eyes.

'He ruled our little community with an iron will and we were made to do what he ordered for fear of angering the Gods.'

After being sexually assaulted by her own mother aged 14, the teenager tried to kill herself. 

'Afterwards, Colin asked me if I enjoyed it and I knew what I had to say - I had to say yes. 

'But inside I felt like dying.

'I was a schoolgirl by day and a sex slave at night.

'It got so bad that at one point I tried to take my own life.'

At the age of 17, Ms Forest became pregnant by her cruel step-father. 

A year after the birth of the child she fled the house in the dead of the night, and did not see either her mother or Batley until their sentencing in 2011.  

'I went to the sentencing in court because I wanted to see her one last time, I wanted her to reach out to me, to say it was all his fault and she was under his spell.

Evil: Colin Batley forced the woman into prostitution to raise money for the cult's 'church' and fathered a baby with her when she was just 17

The woman, who now calls herself Annabelle Forest, has detailed her horrifying childhood in a book 

'But she didn't. She just made a face and asked what I was doing there.

'She went to prison unrepentant and I suppose that made me realise it wasn't just him. She was evil too.

'As a mother myself I can hardly believe how she treated me. It was unnatural and cruel.

'But there is no point getting depressed about it, you have to live for the future.

'But I never want to see her again. Nothing can hurt me as much as they did, but that is what makes me stronger.'

Annabelle, who now lives in north England, has chronicled her horrifying childhood in a memoir tited The Devil on The Doorstep: My Escape from a Satanic Sex Cult. 

The mother-of-two hopes it will help save other children from the ordeal she faced. 

'If there's one thing I would like to achieve with my book, it would be for others to start really paying attention to the community they live in.'

'There are abused children everywhere - it just takes one person to see it and that life could be saved.'  

The cult’s inspiration, Aleister ‘the Great Beast’ Crowley, believed himself to be a prophet of a new age of personal liberty, controlled by the ancient Egyptian god Horus.

He was a bisexual heroin addict whose doctrine for life was ‘Do What Thou Wilt’, advocating sexual promiscuity and prostitution.

Crowley was a frequenter of orgies and brothels, and contracted gonorrhea from a prostitute. 

Born into a wealthy family in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, he gained such notoriety during his lifetime that he was denounced in the press as ‘the wickedest man in the world’.

Crowley’s work has been cited as an influence by famous figures including Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, who bought Crowley’s former home and set up an occult bookshop and publishing house which published some of his work.

One of Crowley’s publications, the Book of the Law, referred to by the prosecution in Batley and Marling's trial, includes the passage: ‘Let all chaste women be utterly despised among you.'

And, in the Authorised Popular Commentary to the The Book of Law, he wrote this: ‘Some of the most passionate and permanent attachments have begun with rape. Rome was founded thereon.’

Aleister Crowley is one of the most notorious satanists of the 20th century and has been described by the press as the 'wickedest man in the world'
