A Pittsburgh woman is suing authorities after she had to have her arm amputated because police officers used ‘excessive force’ while they arrested her and refused to give her access to a doctor.

The mother-of-three, Amy Needham, 35, of Ross, says the officers entered her home to execute an arrest warrant for failing to show up to a preliminary hearing.

When sheriff's office employees arrived, Needham said she was using the bathroom, but they broke down the bathroom door.

They shocked her with a Taser, applied arm bars and wrist locks, and put on handcuffs 'that were too tight' before taking her to Allegheny County Jail, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

According to her attorney, Marvin Leibowitz, the tight handcuffs caused her to suffer compartment syndrome, a limb- and life-threatening condition that occurs after an injury.

It happens when there is insufficient blood supply to muscles and nerves due to increased pressure within the compartment, such as the arm, leg or any enclosed space within the body. 

If uncorrected, the lack of blood supply leads to injury in the affected muscles and nerves.

Leibowitz says while Needham sat in jail, she made 16 requests to see a doctor for treatment but was denied.

‘They never sent her a doctor. Never 
took her to the doctor. She developed a septic shock. The infection went
 over and she almost died and they had to take off her arm to prevent 
her from dying,’ Leibowitz told KDKA.

Needham, who had previously worked in a restaurant, is now waiting for a prosthesis.

According to Leibowitz, the woman has had ‘severe psychological problems’ due to the incident.

‘I think she’s been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She doesn’t have an arm. How is she going to get a job?’

Deputies had arrested her for failing to show up at a preliminary hearing on a charge that was eventually reduced to disorderly conduct.

She is now suing the deputies in question and the Allegheny County Jail and seeks $75,000 in damages.
