After officially announcing his $300million (£200m) mega-fight against Manny Pacquiao, Floyd Mayweather Jnr returned to his Las Vegas gym, and to work.

With just over seven weeks to go until the biggest fight in boxing history, Mayweather was putting his 'Hard work, dedication' motto into practice.

The 38-year-old took turns working on the speed bag, the heavy bag and had a session on the pads.

'I get to see the things that many fans and the media will never know or see.'It’s both inspiring and motivating'
