Jailed: Damian Chwedczuk bit off his wife's ear in the culmination of years of domestic abuse during which he emptied her dead mother's ashes over the floor before vacuuming them up

A supermarket worker bit off his wife's ear in the culmination of years of domestic abuse during which he emptied her dead mother's ashes over the floor before vacuuming them up.

Damian Chwedczuk subjected wife Debbie to three years of abuse, cutting up the SIM card from her phone so she could not contact friends or family, and destroying treasured photographs of her grandson.

Debbie finally plucked up courage to go 
to police after raging Chwedczuk tore a chunk out of her ear in one 
bloody attack last September.

The grandmother had told the 32-year-old thug that she was leaving him, telling him she would be going to stay at a friend's home and heading upstairs to pack a bag, but he refused to let her leave.

Polish-born Chwedczuk then launched his most brutal attack, punching her in the mouth, kicking her in the back and poking her eyes before ripping her right ear off with his teeth.

As Debbie staggered away she saw the upper part of the ear on the floor, picking it up as she ran away to get help.

'I ended up being punched in the face,
 then at one point I was cowering on the floor, but he was hitting my 
back and even tried to gouge my eyes out,' said Debbie, who is now separated from Chwedczuk and does not 
want to give her last name.

'Then
 he actually bit my ear and I just saw part of it lying on the floor. At
 one point, he had my neck in such a way that I thought he was going to 
kill me.'

Chwedczuk was arrested shortly after the attack on September 7 last year and jailed at Ipswich crown Court in January after admitting wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

He is now serving four years and 11 months behind bars.

He told police he had been annoyed with his wife and wanted to hurt her and claimed he had intended to bite her nose.

Chwedczuk, who worked in the same supermarket as his wife, was also banned from contacting her indefinitely.Â 

Debbie had to undergo plastic surgery to repair the damage he caused.

The domestic violence victim has now spoken out about her abuse, urging other women to speak out if they are being subjected to abuse.

'You are worth a lot more than being abused by somebody else,' she said.

'A year ago I would not have thought that I would be in this situation but I feel like I can move on and have a better life.

'I am happier now. I just wish I had got out sooner.'

Debbie, shared a home with Chwedczuk in East Bergholt, Suffolk and put up with three years of abuse before eventually seeking help.

She said: 'He cut up my SIM card so that I could not contact anybody.

'He also destroyed precious things to me, like the photos of my grandson, and threw my mum's ashes all over the floor before vacuuming them up.

'A couple of years ago, he headbutted me and I ended up being taken to hospital by some of my friends, but I did not press charges.

'I told them the old story that I had fallen down the stairs.

'It was just horrendous. It is hard when people say 'just leave', but there are things that hold you there.

'You just hang on but then it gets worse and worse. I do not really know why I stayed, maybe I just did not want to be on my own.'
