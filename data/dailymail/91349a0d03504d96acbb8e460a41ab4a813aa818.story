Fitness fail: Chief Constable Jacqui Cheer attempted the 'bleep test' but came up short

The police chief who helped catch the Suffolk Strangler has become the first Chief Constable to fail to meet the new police fitness targets.

Jacqui Cheer, boss of the Cleveland force, is believed to be the highest ranking officer to flunk the bleep test - while trying to set an example to her staff.

The force admitted she scored 4.2 on the test, compared to the 5.4 her rank and file officers will need to ensure their jobs are safe when the fitness checks come in officially in 12 months' time.

Mrs Cheer, 52, joined Essex Police in 1984 and spent 28 years in uniform.

She headed the investigation of the five prostitute murders in Ipswich in 2006, for which serial killer Steve Wright was jailed.

Mrs Cheer was played by the TV and film actress Jo McInnes in Five Daughters, the television drama based on the case.

It is understood many Cleveland officers already regard the targets as a farce and their own commander failing to measure up has made them even more scornful.

One source said: ‘They just think the whole thing is a nonsense anyway. They think it's a complete joke.’

Expert Prof Craig Jackson, co-author of the report Are Police Fitness Tests Accurate?, said: ‘This is what happens when senior management try to lead by example.

‘It can go horribly wrong.

‘People might think it was just paying lip service to the fitness test and I would be interested to know if she did any training for it.

Plodding is out of the question for officers if they want to pass the 'bleep test'.

The setting for these tests is usually a large sports hall and the candidates must run continuously between two points set 15 metres apart.

The pace for the runs is set by an audio track that plays continuous beeps, with officers required to reach the fixed points before the beep sounds.

The interval between the beeps gradually lessens, so officers have to run faster and faster.

The total amount of running time is usually around three and a half minutes.

Officers are allowed three warnings if they fall behind the pace. If they can't speed up sufficiently and hit the fixed points before the beep sounds the instructor will fail them.

‘The only way she could turn this into a success by getting fit and passing it. That would win over the officers and people's perceptions.’

Some forces favour an assault course which mimics what front line officers do during the working day, such as crawling and climbing.

The Birmingham City University expert's research suggests this obstacle course is unfair because it excludes too many female officers while letting too many podgy males through.

But he believes the shuttle run used by forces such as Cleveland is fair to both sexes and ‘a fail is a fail’.

He was not aware of any other Chief Constables taking and failing the test.

‘It's good to see one having a go but it seems to have backfired in this particular case and is not good PR,’ he added.

A spokesman for the Police Federation
of England and Wales said: ‘The Police Federation feels that police 
officers should be fit to perform the role they do and we need to be 
realistic about the fact that a Chief Constable is not going to be 
knocking down doors and arresting people in the town centre on a 
Saturday night.

‘We
do have some concerns about the fairness of national fitness testing 
proposals, and will continue to engage with ACPO and the College of 
Policing to ensure these concerns are addressed.’

Time trial: The bleep test involves a series of 15-metre shuttle runs at ever increasing speed

After rising through the ranks, Mrs Cheer joined Suffolk Constabulary in 2006 as Assistant Chief Constable after working in the Home Office Reform Unit.

After helping snare the Suffolk Strangler, she joined Cleveland Police - initially as Temporary Chief Constable - in 2011 when predecessor Sean Price was suspended and later sacked for misconduct following a probe into corruption allegations at the force.

Under the Government plans, officers have to reach level 5.4 of the bleep or 'beep test', which involves completing a series of 15-metre shuttle runs at ever increasing speed.

If they succeed, they will have been able to run for 3 minutes 34 seconds.

Those who fail will be given a fitness plan and 12 months to measure up - or face dismissal for 'unsatisfactory performance'.

At one stage, failure was to be regarded as a disciplinary offence. Now officers are given support and time to pass.

A Cleveland Police spokeswoman said: ‘The fitness tests started as a pilot this month and will be implemented in September 2014 for officers who undertake safety training for roles such as patrolling.

‘Over the summer, a familiarisation exercise was run so that officers could see what the tests would entail, and the Chief Constable took part in the full day as she was keen to see what tests the officers would undergo, as well as supporting her staff.

‘As she does not undertake an active operational role, she is not required to take the fitness test.’The Association of Chief Police Officers refused to comment Mrs Cheer's performance, saying it would not discuss a specific case.

ACC Robin Merrett, national fitness working group lead said: ‘Annual fitness testing is being introduced to policing and involves a 15m shuttle run to be completed to an endurance level of 5:4 and is compliant with equality legislation.’ There is no obstacle course or upper strength testing as part of this annual fitness test.

‘We will be ensuring that the fitness test does not unlawfully discriminate against gender or other protected groups, and for the first 12 month the College of Policing will audit data on pass and failures to understand how specific groups are performing.’

The College of Policing, which is the guiding light of the new fitness regime, underlined there was no instant dismissal threat for officers who failed to measure up.

The scheme was being piloted for 12 months and staff would be given support to pass.If an officer repeatedly failed it would be an operational matter for the individual force whether disciplinary measures were required.

But there was no reference in the official guidelines to dismissal, the College said.
