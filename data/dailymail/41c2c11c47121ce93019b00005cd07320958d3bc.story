In Barrow, Alaska, it all begins with a euphoric voice over a crackling radio: 'Hey, hey, hey!'

The signal from an Inupiat whaling captain in a tiny boat on the grey waters of the Chukchi Sea is heard in nearly every home of this frozen town as far north as you can go in the United States, and its meaning is clearly understood.

A bowhead whale - one of the oldest and largest mammals on earth - has been caught. 

The marine mammal, which can reach sixty feet in length and weigh more than 100 tons, required a Herculean effort to move. Work continued into the night to butcher it into manageable portions.

Keeping with a tradition that stretches back thousands of years, bowhead whales are hunted by boat during the fall season.

Once ashore, residents flock to help in the work of divvying up the whale. 

As children slide down the whale's slippery side, officials inspect the catch and ensure the hunters have followed international guidelines to keep traditional whaling on a subsistence scale for native communities.

The skin and blubber, known as muktuk, is prized by the Inupiat, and often eaten frozen. 

The community says the catch helps them feed their families in the town where produce such as watermelons that are flown in cost as much as $20 each at the local grocery.

Bloody: A cutter stands on top of the whale - the meat, baleen, bones and organs are used for food, art, household goods, and construction

From ship to shore: Once a whale is caught, it is pulled on land by the tiny boats, in an effort that often takes hours

Giant: The whales, which can reach sixty feet in length and weigh more than 100 tons, can take a Herculean effort to move

Sliced: Blades lashed to poles are used to cut down through the blubber in sections, to be hooked and hauled off

Enough for all: A section of the skin and blubber is reserved for the captain of the boat, who hosts a feast for the community 

Tradition: Children of Barrow too small to help with the hooking and cutting, are brought down to the whale to learn about the process

Air mail: Some sections of blubber are placed into duct-taped coolers and shipped by plane to elders living in warmer climates farther south

Keeping the energy up: As workers continue with the cutting and hooking of the whale blubber, others prepare a soup to warm the crews

Getting into the spirit: Most members of a whaling family pitch in once a whale is caught. Often, three generations of a whaling family are at the task of butchering and dividing the whale

Manual task: Young whalers learn about butchering on job - they start by using a hook to pull off the giant slabs of skin and blubber - later, they may move to the more skilled task of cutter

Momento: Whale bones are coveted by many in Barrow, often used to adorn the grave sites of loved ones

Clean up time: After a whale is divided and shared, blood and some remains are hauled off farther from town
