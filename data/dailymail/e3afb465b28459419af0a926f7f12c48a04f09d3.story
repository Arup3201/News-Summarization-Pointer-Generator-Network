Bitter Arctic winds could plunge parts of Britain into the coldest spell of August weather for almost a century.

Thermometers are set to plummet as a stubborn band of low pressure drags air in from the north - with two weeks of wet, windy and cold weather on the horizon.

There is even a chance of snow and sleet over the mountains of Scotland as it dips to near freezing overnight.

Government figures show the last time it was this cold in August was in 1919 when the mercury rose no higher than 8.9C  for four days in Yorkshire and Cumbria.

 It is not expected to rise above 9C in parts of the north during the day all week with chilly winds making it feel much colder.

The Met Office said Loadpot Hill, in Cumbria, is unlikely to see a maximum daytime temperature of more than 8C on Thursday.

Forecasters blame an area of low pressure circling off the north of the UK for the cold and miserable week ahead.

Met Office spokeswoman Charlie Powell said: 'The lowest daily maximum temperature we have is in Cumbria, Yorkshire and Shetland which was 8.9C in 1919. At the moment it looks like Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday this week will see temperatures in that bracket.'

Laura Young from the Met Office said: 'It is going to be much cooler this week, unseasonably cool due to much colder air coming down from the north.

'This is due to low pressure drawing in air from that region, it is going to be much cooler across all parts of the UK, especially at night.'

Two weeks of wet, windy and cool weather have been predicted, with a disappointing Bank Holiday weekend expected in most of the country.

Forecasters said there is 'not much to be optimistic about' as temperatures look set to remain below average with spells of rain throughout the rest of August.

This comes after Britain endured a battering from Hurricane Bertha with raging gales and torrential rain hurtling through the UK earlier this month.

Temperatures today will reach about 20C, three or four degrees lower than normal for August, and drop again tomorrow.

But winds blowing from the Arctic will make it feel even cooler.

Britain should also brace itself for heavy showers, particularly in the eastern side of the country today, according to the Met Office.

Forecaster Dan Williams from the Met Office said: 'There are no warnings in place regarding flooding. But there will be showers today across Britain, especially in the eastern side of the country.

'In most places the temperature will be hovering around the high teens.' 

Overnight the temperature could drop to 3C in the coldest spots in the country, particularly Scotland.

Scattered showers will be continuing across the country tomorrow and the top temperature will be hovering around 19C.

Mr Williams said: 'On Wednesday it will start to become a little milder, with temperatures closer to average. Due to the Westerly airflow, the temperature will have a chance to recover.

'In general it looks unsettled and changeable over the next two weeks. On the Saturday of the bank holiday it doesn't look too bad, with dry weather, calm winds and some sunny spells. But there be low pressure coming from the Atlantic and depending on how fast that moves across will dictate the weather for the Sunday and Monday.'

Billy Payne, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'The weather is certainly looking disappointing for the next couple of weeks.

'It's going to be cool and rather unsettled - there's not much to be optimistic about.

'The next few days will be showery and cold. Most showers will be in the North and West but some spreading south-eastwards.

'Temperatures in Scotland and the North will struggle to reach the teens but still might get to 20 in the South East.

'By the time we get to Thursday there will be longer spells of rain in the North, spreading south-westwards through Friday.'

The early forecast for the Bank Holiday spells cool and windy weather, with the odd shower, which will continue throughout next week.

It will not be welcome news for the organisers of Notting Hill Carnival, Europe's biggest street carnival event, which will see hundreds of musicians and dancers join floats for a procession through the streets of west London on Sunday and Bank Holiday Monday.
