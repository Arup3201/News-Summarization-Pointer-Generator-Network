Hillary Clinton has accepted her husband Bill's philandering ways but told him that 'when we are back in the White House, he'll have to behave,' according to a new book by former Newsweek editor Ed Klein.

That's 'when,' not 'if.'

But Hillary's apparent certainty about her presidential plans has taken a back seat in reviews of the book, 'Blood Feud,' to accounts of vicious backbiting between the Clintons and the Obamas.

Even tales of exploits of the former 'first cheater' have garnered little notice.

According to Klein, Hillary told friends that Bill is 'having another of his middle-age crises.' And she doesn't seem to mind.

No more 'Slick Willie': 'I've told him that when we are back in the White House he'll have to behave,' Hillary Clinton told her friends last year, Ed Klein writes in Blood Feud

During one of Bill Clinton's whirlwind trips across the world, he met with 'the playboy king of Spain' King Juan Carlos I in Madrid

'We accept 
each other as we are and chase our collective dream,' Klein quotes her as saying to a group of confidantes.

'All that s**t of 
throwing things at him and yelling is in the distant past.'

The specter of the former president being properly referred to as America's 'first gentleman' has produced eye-rolls and chuckles in Washington, given his penchant for being seen with gorgeous starlets and famed Lotharios in exotic locations.

'During one recent whirlwind trip around 
the world,' Hillary reportedly told her friends, Bill 'started off in Hollywood with Charlize Theron 
at an event for GLADD, the gay and lesbian advocacy group.'

'Then he went 
to Peru with Scarlett Johansson; jetted off to Madrid to spend a few 
days with Juan Carlos, the playboy king of Spain; went next to London to
 meet Elton John and his husband David Furnish, then was off to Vienna 
for an AIDS benefit with his new best friends Eva Longoria and Carmen 
Electra.'

It was all part of a conversation in May 2013, two months after Hillary left the State Department, at the French restaurant Le Jardin du Roi near the Clintons' home in Chappaqua, New York.

'This guy is unstoppable,' she reportedly told her friends.

'I've told 
him that when we are back in the White House,' she added, according to 
Klein, 'he'll have to behave. He laughed hysterically. We are at that 
point where we can joke about it. You have to love him. I do.'

The revelation came as the Washington Free Beacon published audio excerpts from a series of interviews the Clintons did in the 1980s with a reporter who planned to write a profile for Esquire magazine.

'When a person gets to be a certain age it’s hard to change a lot,' said Clinton, then hovering around 40 years of age.

'But
 I think I have been able to change some of my bad habits, and to shore 
up my weaknesses a little better, set up a system which helps my 
strengths.'

In Hillary Clinton's 2013 dinner conversation, Klein writes, she also bashed president Obama and his leadership style, calling him 'incompetent and feckless' and saying 'you can’t trust the motherf***er.'

'The thing with Obama is that he can’t be bothered and there is no hand on the tiller half the time,' she is said to have barked in a boozy rant. ‘That’s the story of the Obama presidency. No hand on the f***ing tiller.’

'Obama has turned into a joke,' she declares in Klein's account.

'The IRS targeting the Tea Party, the Justice Department’s seizure of AP phone records and James Rosen’s emails – all these scandals. Obama’s allowed his hatred for his enemies to screw him the way Nixon did.'

The Clintons have been under a renewed spotlight since the publication of Hillary's memoir, 'Hard Choices,' and her ham-fisted media interviews in which she claimed she and Bill were not among America's richest elites.

Financial disclosures, however, put their worth in the eight-figure range. And they routinely pull in between $200,000 and $500,000 for public speeches.
