A Stillwater, Minnesota, restaurant is under fire after it passed on a recent minimum wage hike by adding part of the extra 75 cents an hour to customers' checks.

The state ordered a mandatory wage increase effective August 1, but Oasis Cafe owner Craig Beemer reacted by adding a 35 cent 'minimum wage fee' directly to diners' tabs, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.

Members of the community were outraged and took to Facebook to voice their fury. The phone was also reportedly running hot with complaints.

However, Oasis Cafe manager Colin Orcutt defended Beemer's decision claiming they were only being upfront with their customers.

He said that in order to keep their doors open they needed to pass on the increase, and that doing it indirectly through raising prices of their menu items would have been 'a lot more backhanded.'

The increase was the first time Minnesota has hiked the minimum wage in a decade. Beemer only has six servers on the pay roll, but he said it will cost him $10,000 more a year to pay them $8 an hour instead of the federal rate of $7.25 an hour.

It's not clear if Oasis Cafe is only restaurant to react to the news by imposing such a fee.

According to the Star-Tribune, one customer called the cafe Wednesday to demand a refund and others encourage people to boycott the roadside cafe on Facebook.

'We're shocked at what's going on,' manager Colin Orcutt told the Star-Tribune of the public response.

'We're all appalled at the response for just protecting his employees. We're just doing what we have to do.'

But Wade Luneburg of the MN State Council of UNITE HERE Unions told the Star Tribune that the restaurant is 'overreacting.'

'Putting (minimum wage) fees on tickets and passing the cost on to consumers directly is strange at best, and creates an "us against them" mentality while ordering dinner.'

Despite the online boycott threats, business has actually increased at Oasis Cafe this week, Orcutt told the newspaper.

'(Beemer) wants people to be aware we're a small business and we're trying to stay open,' he said, adding that the cafe considered doing away with severs altogether and resorting to counter service to make ends meet.
