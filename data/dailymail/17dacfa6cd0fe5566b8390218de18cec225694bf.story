Residents of an idyllic country village have been so overwhelmed with an invasion of flies that they are considering moving.

Villagers in Finghall, North Yorkshire, say they have been driven to tears by the large number of flies entering their homes.

The infestation is so bad that one resident counted 40 flies in his kitchen and 30 in his dining room, while another local said 150 were found on fly paper that had only been hung three days earlier.

Industrial fly catching bags are full and environmental health have been contacted over the issue

Local poultry farms have been blamed by some for the problem and the council's environmental health team have now been contacted.

At a residents' meeting held to discuss the issue locals said they were keeping doors and windows closed constantly, even on the hottest days.

One villager said a blind relative had inadvertently eaten flies which had landed on his food, while a holiday cottage owner said recent visitors would not return to the village because of the problem.

Margaret Moffatt, who lives in the village with husband Brian, said: 'Apparently one villager was told that he was "silly complaining and what did he expect when living in the rural area surrounded by farms".

'My family has lived in the rural areas far more remote than Finghall and has never experienced the problems we have now.'

Another resident said: 'My wife has given me an ultimatum that we should move out of this area to somewhere they don't have these damn flies.'

Some residents blamed nearby poultry farms for the outbreak, which they said had occurred every summer for more than a decade.

Richmondshire District Council has been notified about the issue and an officer from the environmental health unit left fly papers with residents.

They will be collected after a week and then tested.

A spokeswoman said: 'We have spoken to residents and will be investigating.'

Local mechanic Ray Robson, 46, said: 'The village have been up in arms about it.

'There are a lot more flies than normal and where we sit in our bait room we are getting loads of them buzzing around our face. 

'When I was working on a car the other day there were around 200 flies covering the car. I don't know whether it is weather related.'

Keith Loadman, Richmondshire district councillor, said the problem must be addressed.

He said: 'I have known about it for a couple of years - it is so serious in the village that we can't afford to be fobbed off.'

Ian Hainsworth, chair of the parish council, added: 'This will not be allowed to drop.

'We will take it forward as forcibly as we can.'
