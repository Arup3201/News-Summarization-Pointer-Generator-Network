An enforcer for hate preacher Anjem Choudary yesterday admitted joining a ‘Muslim Patrol’ which threatened to enforce sharia law.

Jordan Horner, 19, was a leading member of a vigilante mob that roamed London’s East End attacking non-Muslims in a campaign against Western culture.

The gang threatened to ‘kill non-believers’ and ‘shank’ or stab them and uploaded videos to YouTube criticising people’s appearance.

The ginger-haired convert, who uses the name Jamaal Uddin, admitted assaulting two men during one confrontation.

During a hearing at the Old Bailey, he
 also pleaded guilty to two public order offences via video link from 
high security Belmarsh Prison.

Horner is a close associate of Choudary and was arrested outside his home earlier this year for assaulting a photographer.

The outspoken thug has boasted that one of his heroes is Osama bin Laden and said British soldiers will burn in hell.

He was held as part of a highly 
sensitive Met investigation into the self-titled Muslim Patrol, that 
operated in the Tower Hamlets area of East London. The intimidating mob 
was seen walking the streets in the early hours of the morning last 
December and January.

One morning, Horner and others 
snatched cans of beers from a group of five men before emptying them in 
the gutter. They shouted: ‘Why are you poisoning your body? It is 
against Islam. This is Muslim Patrol. Kill the non believers.’

One then told another to ‘go get the 
shank’, meaning a knife, but as the men started to walk away, Horner 
threw several punches, hitting one on the jaw. At an earlier hearing a 
prosecutor said: ‘The victims describe the main aggressor as being 
ginger with a ginger beard.’

Horner also admitted threatening two couples and a man in the capital in December and January.

The ‘Muslim Patrol’ sparked huge 
controversy when it posted a series of videos on YouTube, including one 
called ‘The Truth About Saturday Night’.

In them they confronted members
 of the public, demanding they give up alcohol and that women cover 
themselves in a ‘Muslim area’. The hooded men filmed themselves calling 
white women ‘naked animals with no self-respect’ and labelled alcohol 
‘evil’ as they stole it from revellers.

In one bizarre exchange they filmed an
 injured cyclist being treated after a road accident and claimed he was 
hurt because he was unclean.

One said, ‘We don’t care if you are 
appalled at all,’ before calling themselves ‘vigilantes implementing 
Islam upon your own necks.’

Threats: Horner told a photographer he could end up like murdered soldier Lee Rigby, pictured

In another clip, the group protested 
against adverts for push-up bras by High Street retailer H&M, 
pouring petrol over one and setting it alight.

They said: ‘The Muslims have taken it upon themselves to command the good and forbid the evil and cover up these naked people.’

Horner was a troubled youth who became an enforcer for Choudary when he converted to Islam after being approached outside a pub.

He has said: ‘People need to realise 
sharia law is coming. What better person to spread the message than one 
whose life was once so corrupted?’

In July, he was jailed for six weeks 
for beating up a photographer and causing £3,000 of damage to a car in 
an attack outside Choudary’s home.

Horner told his victim that he could 
be killed like soldier Lee Rigby, who was almost decapitated outside his
 barracks in Woolwich, South-East London. The photographer said Horner 
shouted ‘you’re scum, brother’, adding: ‘You should be careful. What 
happened to the boy soldier could happen to you.’

Horner, of Walthamstow, East London, 
appeared at the Old Bailey alongside Ricardo McFarlane and a 23-year-old
 man who cannot be named for legal reasons.

He will be sentenced after 
they go on trial next month accused of also taking part in the attack, 
and other offences.
