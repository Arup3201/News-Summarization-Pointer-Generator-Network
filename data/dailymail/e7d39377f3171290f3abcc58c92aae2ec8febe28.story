A British man has broken the record for speeding on a French motorway hitting at least 160mph.

French transport police said the UK registered Audi R8 was travelling so fast their speed gun went off the scale and stopped working.

As a result it is impossible to know if the car was in fact being driven at a faster speed, police confirmed.

Astonished traffic officers said it took them four miles to catch up with the driver after he roared past them on the A28 motorway in Normandy on Monday.

The driver was identified only as a businessman from London in a company car. French police have so far refused to name him. 

The
 vehicle was impounded on orders from the prosecutor at Evreux and the 
driver's license was confiscated. He was immediately banned from driving
 on all French roads.

He has also been summoned to appear in court where he faces a fine of up to £1,300.

A
 traffic police spokesman said: ‘This is the fastest speed we have ever 
recorded on the entire Normandy motorway network that we patrol.

‘In fact we couldn't get the exact speed because the radar stopped working.’

The
 man was one of seven UK drivers clocked at more than 120mph in on the 
same stretch of road over the weekend, amid police claims British 
motorists treat French roads like a racetrack.

Police in northern 
France frequently complain that British drivers ignore their speed 
limits because they cannot be given points on their licence in France.

Speedway: The driver of the Audi R8 was caught driving at speeds of more than 160mph along the main route from Le Mans to Rouen on Monday

Thousands
 of British racing fans make the annual pilgrimage to the Le Mans 
racetrack at this time of year for the famous 24-hour endurance race.

It
 is not known whether any of the British drivers pulled over by the 
police for speeding at the weekend had attended the race. But the A28 is
 the main route from Calais to the Le Mans

It comes just days after Danish driver Allan Simonsen died after crashing his car during the race last weekend.

Race
 officials said the 34-year-old spun off after about 10 minutes of the 
race in his Aston Martin and hit the safety barriers at the Tertre Rouge
 bend.

He was taken to the medical centre at the premises but later died of his injuries, the organisers said.

Britons en route to the south of France this summer should beware if they spot an innocent-looking Renault Megane on the road.

It it may not be so innocent after all and could in fact be the latest Gallic weapon in the war against speeding drivers.

French police have chosen the holiday months of July and August to test a fleet of 40 anonymous Renault Meganes packed with radar, which will cruise the motorways in disguise hoping to catch speedsters unaware.

Dubbed the 'Beasts with the Kodak' by the traffic officers the cars look harmless but they have radar equipment concealed behind the front number plate and a camera is hidden in a small, black box perched discreetly on the dashboard.

Police officers must wear uniforms when on duty by law, but they aren't obliged to wear their caps.

Exceeding the speed limit by less than 20 kilometres per hour will land motorists with a fine of €68 (£58), rising to a whopping €1,500 (£1271) for excessive speed (more than 50 kph too fast).

The French have plans to equip an extra fleet of Peugeot 208s which will hit the roads in September in time to catch the last homeward bound tourists heading for the channel ports.

The speed limit on a French motorway is 81mph in the dry and 69mph in the wet unless special restrictions apply.

Calais
 police said in an average summer month, eight out of ten motorists 
pulled over for speeding on the A26 motorway between Calais and Paris are British.

Illuminated
 panels warning drivers to cut their speed on the 70-mile stretch of 
road are now flashed up in English as well as French.

A motorway 
police spokesman said: ‘Some British drivers are often oblivious to the 
speed limits, and treat the road like they are out for a day's motor 
racing.’

‘They seem to think that because they are in a foreign country, the rules do not apply to them.’

But
 Rosie Sanderson, a spokesperson for the AA, rejected the stereotype of 
British drivers travelling at break-neck speeds in France. However, she 
admitted it was easy to become complacent about speed limits when 
driving abroad.

‘As soon as you get in the car, you get in holiday 
mode, and as soon as you get on foreign soil, it can be easy to lose 
track of speed limits,’ she said.

Two other Britons have previously broken speed records on French motorways.

A British lawyer hit 148mph in an Aston Martin on the A4 motorway two years ago.

Another
 Briton, Sean Barlow from Surrey, still holds the record for the highest
 speed ever recorded on the A26 motorway from Calais to Paris.

He was jailed for five days in November 2003 for dangerous driving after being clocked doing 153mph.
