Airlines which fly suspected terrorists out of the country in breach of Home Office order will be hit with fines of up to £50,000 under new laws to come into force within weeks.

The penalties would be applied to any carrier which breaches a government ‘no fly’ instruction and allows a jihadist to travel on their planes.

Smaller fines of up to £10,000 could be applied where airlines fail to hand over detailed information about its passengers and crew.

The new powers are designed to prevent potential terrorists travelling overseas to fight with Isis. They were rushed through the House of Commons on Tuesday night and will come into force early next month.

If police or the security agencies are aware of someone’s intention to travel, an automatic alert can be put next to their name which instructs an airline to pull them from the flight.

The new rules will require all carriers to use data systems which automatically respond to instructions from police to offload or screen any passenger.

Anyone who is subject to a Terror Prevention and Investigation Measure (Tpim) will also be prevented from travel.

Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said: ‘We have a fundamental duty as a government to ensure that the people who work to keep us safe have the powers they need to do so.'

Mr Brokenshire added: ‘This important legislation will disrupt the ability of people to travel abroad to fight and then return. It will also enhance our ability to monitor and control those who pose a threat.

‘We have always been clear that we will take the strongest possible action against those who travel to Syria and come back to the UK with the intention of doing harm — both through our existing powers and by toughening them even further.’

All the measures are expected to come into force early next month, subject to approval in the Lords.

Home Secretary Theresa May has also ordered officials to draw up new guidance for airlines requiring them to alert the police if young people attempt to travel on routes used to get to Syria.
