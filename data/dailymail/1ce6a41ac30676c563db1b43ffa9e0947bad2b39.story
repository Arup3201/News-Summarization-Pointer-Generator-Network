An Arizona wife accused of trying to kill her husband by injecting fecal matter into his intravenous line was sentenced Tuesday to a year in jail after being convicted of abuse.

Rose Mary Vogel, 66, of Sun Lakes, pleaded guilty nearly two months ago to a charge of vulnerable adult abuse in the January 30 incident at Chandler Regional Hospital.

The retired nurse - who has a masters and a bachelors degree in nursing -  had faced up to 10 years in prison. 

Her plea agreement called for an attempted murder charge to be dropped.

Caught red-handed: Rose Mary Vogel, 66, was sentenced to four years of probation and one year of weekends in jail after she was found tampering with her husband's IV line at an Arizona hospital in January

Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Robert Gottsfield said Vogel could serve the jail time on weekends, the Arizona Republic reported. 

He also sentenced her to four years of probation.

Authorities say two nurses saw Vogel tampering with her husband's IV line while he was in the hospital for a heart stent procedure earlier this year.

The nurses were responding to a pump alarm that went off, and arrived to find Vogel touching the pump line.

One nurse noticed a brown liquid in the saline solution that smelled.

The nurse capped the line and went to find help, only to return to see Vogel trying to dump the solution in a trash can, according to AZ Central. 

A lab test later determined  substance found in the line was fecal matter. 

Police also say they found three syringes in Vogel's purse, and one had a brown substance on a protective cap.

Her husband survived the contamination after becoming ill.

Vogel said during the sentencing hearing that she was sleep-deprived and depressed when she contaminated the line and had no recollection of it.

'I've always loved my husband through sickness and in health,' she said.

Her husband, Phillip Vogel, said he has forgiven his wife. 

On trial: Prosecutors claimed Vogel was not trying to kill her husband but further debilitate him

The two suggested their relationship is on the mend.

'It's so devastating on our family,' he said. 

'Rose Mary is no danger to me.'

Defense lawyer Lawrence Kazan has said in court records that his client had what appeared to be a fairly happy 35-year marriage. 

But he said there were unspecified problems that caused her to snap and try to harm her husband.

Vogel is a retired registered nurse who has surrendered her nursing license to medical regulators. 

Kazan noted she had no prior criminal history.
