A glamour model known as Sonya Milkshake who dated Rurik Jutting for four years has said: ‘It could have been me.’

Sonya Dyer, 29, was said to be distraught after learning he was suspected of mutilating two prostitutes.

Miss Dyer, who posed for racy photoshoots while pouring banana milkshake over her cleavage, was one of two British women romanced by Jutting before he moved to Hong Kong in July last year.

The other has been named as Goldman Sachs banker Sarah Butt, a privately educated former grammar school student who worked with Jutting at Barclays.

Miss Butt, 28, was said to have been his fiancee two years ago, but he was left heartbroken after their engagement was called off.

Last night a friend of London-born Miss Dyer said the fashion model, who had lived with Jutting in Wapping, East London, was shocked.

‘She was in a relationship with him for over four years and they shared a flat. She thinks it could have been her. She’s feeling really confused,’ said the friend.

‘It was a serious relationship. They lived together although they never got engaged. He never ill-treated her. He never hit her or treated her with anything but respect.

‘That’s why Sonya is emotionally all over the place now. She can’t understand what happened.’ 

Ms Dyers is among a string of beautiful girls linked to the former public schoolboy's astonishing private life, including an British ex-fiancee who apparently left him 'devastated' after cheating on him.

Today, it was revealed that Ms Dyer has featured in a number of racy publications including men's 'urban glamour and lifestyle' magazine CandymagUK - and posed provocatively in a bikini while pouring milkshake over herself and her cleavage.

The fashion student appeared in a saucy video for the magazine in 2010 in which she dances provocatively before covering herself in smoothie.

Speaking to the camera, she says: 'I'm currently on the set of my milkshake shoot. I've got the milkshake here. 

'I'm wearing some sexy gear as well. Keeping it sexy, keeping it funky.

'I'm also going to be pouring some strawberry milkshake over me, so watch as I get dirty.'

However, in an accompanying interview, she said she was keen to show that models are not 'all slutty', adding that she wanted to change's people's perception of the industry. 

Ms Dyer, who was brought up in London by Jamaican parents, said: 'People have got the wrong impression about me but I think from doing this I might be able to change people's minds about models.

'It's important for me to be vocal about who I am, to show people that models aren't all slutty and we're not always at the club every night.

'You can be an intelligent, spiritual and well-rounded woman. And that's inspiring for other girls to look up to.'

In a separate feature with Dream magazine, she told how she started modelling after a friend persuaded her that it would boost her confidence.

Her modelling agent confirmed to reporters that she had been in a relationship with Jutting for several years and that it had ended 'recently'.

She had roles in the 2008 film How To Lose Friends And Alienate People and the BBC1 drama Ashes To Ashes.

Jutting is said to have gone skiing with Miss Dyer in 2013, making it unclear whether there was some overlap with his relationship with Miss Butt.

Pictures of Ms Dyer with Jutting show the trader looking far slimmer than when he was arrested over the weekend. 

The agent was reportedly inviting bids for exclusive access to interview Ms Dyer.

She was once said to have described Jutting as her 'hubby'. 

Asked about him at her flat in West London last night, she tearfully declined to comment.

An acquaintance in the banking world recalled Jutting being distraught two years ago after his then-fiancée – a fellow British trader – cheated on him with another man.

The woman, named by The Telegraph as Sarah Butt, 28, had met Jutting in 2010 when they were both working for Barclays in London. 

However, she reportedly had kissed another man after moving to New York from London to work for Goldman Sachs last year. 

Although the couple attempted to rekindle their romance - even getting engaged for a short time - Jutting struggled to get over the 'affair' and ended the relationship a short time later.

Miss Butt was born in Bury, where her parents still live. One of three siblings, she attended £9,000-a-year Bury Grammar School and studied engineering at Imperial College London.

She worked briefly at PricewaterhouseCoopers before joining Barclays Capital and then Goldman Sachs, spending about 12 months working in New York before returning to London, where she works as an associate on European special situations.

Her main business is with clients who are ‘high net worth individuals’.

Miss Butt, who was named by the Daily Telegraph, could not be traced for comment yesterday and there was no answer at her parents’ house. Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

A City source told the paper that Jutting and Miss Butt ‘spent everything they made’ and described him as ‘preoccupied with power and money’.

After leaving £34,000-a-year Winchester College, he graduated in 2008 from Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he studied law and history and was secretary of the university's history society.

Friends speaking to the Evening Standard described Jutting as 'very sharp, very bright, and perceptive' and 'more a leader than a follower' while a pupil at the college.

Speaking anonymously, one said they assumed Jutting was looking for a job reference when his name appeared in the subject line of an email following his arrest on Saturday.

'If they had been looking for a reference, I'd have said: I wouldn't want to spend more than an hour in a room with him, but he was incredibly bright.'

Another said of the schoolboy Jutting: 'He was more a leader than a follower. He wasn't assertive particularly, but was a bit over the top in his mannerisms. 

'He was arrogant rather than aloof. He was quite pleased with himself.'   

A third Winchester contemporary added: 'I'd say he was - it may seem surprising - rather attractive. He had a sort of controlled poise and a certain understated smugness, a sort of superior air, but lightly worn. 

'He seemed quite detached. I'd never have described him as affable.'

Former schoolmates also spoke of their shock at seeing Jutting looking bloated in recent photographs - adding that they remember him as being 'slim, tanned and attractive.'   

Jutting later worked as a trader at Barclays Bank in London for two years before joining Merrill Lynch. In 2013, he moved to Merrill's Hong Kong office.

He surrounded himself with beautiful Asian women and showed off his new life to friends back home in a series of online updates.

Many of the pictures he posted featured young mother Ariane Guarin from the Philippines – known to friends as Yanie.

The couple uploaded photographs of themselves to their respective Facebook pages in July and August but appear to have broken up by early September.

On September 20, a friend took to Jutting's Facebook page to say she missed the couple and wished they were still together. 

Miss Guarin had divided her time between looking after her children in a small town in the Philippines and partying with overweight Jutting, who called her his 'beautiful honey'. 

Miss Guarin, whose family live in Angono, a tiny town ten miles east of Philippine capital Manila, is seen wearing necklaces and rings in shots with Jutting and appeared to come into money, with friends asking her for loans on Facebook, where she boasted of building a new home in the Philippines.

Such was their lavish lifestyle together, her friends compared the couple to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie – known by the combined name 'Brangelina' – by calling Rurik and Yanie 'Ruyanie'.
