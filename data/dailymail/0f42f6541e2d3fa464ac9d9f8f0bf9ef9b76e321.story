For most holidaymakers, there's enough fear of heights to be had from the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building.

Clearly these are not living on the edge enough for James Kingston - who dangled a 'free climber' off the side of a 377ft-high bridge in the Ukraine holding only his wrist.

The thrillseeker known only as Mustang Wanted is the leader of an urban free climbing craze in Eastern Europe, which sees young people tackling ever-larger monuments with no harnesses.

Don't look down! The Ukranian daredevil known as Mustang Wanted dangles off a 377ft high bridge

Terrifying: Traffic rushes below the thrillseeker's feet as he holds the hand of 23-year-old James Kingston

Dangerous: The climbs are illegal and one slip of the hand could kill those taking part

Iconic: The Moscow Bridge, shown being scaled by 23-year-old James Kingston, is a Ukranian landmark

No fear: The pair of young men on top of the bridge, which carries several lanes of traffic

James, 23, lives with his mother near Southampton and spends his spare time scaling cranes and radio towers.

A new documentary shows him teaming up with the thrillseeker, donning camera helmets and crawling fast up the side of the bridge, which carries several lanes of traffic over the Dnieper River in the Ukranian capital Kiev.

They reach the apex of the bridge and Mustang Wanted rubs his hands together, preparing them for the big stunt.

He and James then secure their grip - before Mustang dangles perilously over the side of the bridge, one slip from certain death.

The film follows James near his Southampton home, climbing 500ft structures, and on an out-of-the-ordinary pilgrimage to the Ukraine - said to be the spiritual home of urban free climbing.

Daring or idiotic: The film shows Ukranian thrillseeker Mustang Wanted scale the metal cables of a bridge

Ascent: As the pair (James behind) climb higher, they rise above billboards and electricity wires

Fearless: Gradually they recede until they are almost impossible to make out against the sky

Sweaty? Mustang Wanted dries his hands on his trousers before attempting the feat

He grabs the wrist of 23-year-old James... and lowers himself off the side of the bridge

A Channel 4 spokesman said the show, which could attract controversy, will come with a warning

There he teams up with Mustang Wanted and on camera they climb derelict buildings and tightrope-walk hundreds of feet above the city, before their final stunt at its iconic bridge.

A Channel 4 spokesman said the documentary, to be shown tonight, explores 'one of the world's most dangerous and most terrifying new crazes'.

The young daredevils climb cranes and derelict buildings illegally for the ultimate adrenaline fix - and one which could well cost them their lives.

The spokesman added: 'James's actions are clearly set in context in the programme.Â  It will be proceeded by an appropriate warning and Channel 4 in no-way condones or encourages his behaviour.'

Don't Look Down airs tonight (Sunday, January 19) on Channel 4 at 9pm.
