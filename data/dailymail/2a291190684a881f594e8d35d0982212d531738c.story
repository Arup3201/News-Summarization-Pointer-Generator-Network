Desperate families who were talked into selling their homes and then renting them back in order to pay-off mortgage arrears and other debts were conned, the City watchdog said.

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has issued a damning verdict on the firms behind these ‘sale and rent back’ schemes.

The companies, generally small specialist finance firms, offered to buy the home of a client – generally for around 60-70per cent of its true market value.

The idea was that the family involved would get a lump sum to clear the mortgage and other debts yet still be able to remain in their home paying rent

The idea was that the family involved would get a lump sum to clear the mortgage and other debts yet still be able to remain in their home paying rent.

However, many did not realise that their right to stay could be limited to just five years, while the cash sums involved were often too little to clear their debts and rents were high.

In a ruling published yesterday, the FSA said: ‘Most sale and rent back (SRB) transactions were either unaffordable or unsuitable and never should have been sold’.

The watchdog has effectively shut down the entire industry with immediate effect, while it is investigating bringing legal action against at least one of the firms.

Five companies involved in selling the deals have been ordered to look through their books in order to offer redress, which could include cancelling the contracts, to victims of the scam.

However, it has emerged that the protection offered by the FSA only relates to 61 families who took out sale and rent back (SRB) schemes since 2009, which is when the watchdog began regulating the sector.

By contrast, another 50,000 people who took out the schemes before 2009 could be left high and dry. The FSA has said they will need to pursue their own claims against the firms involved.

Head of the FSA’s mortgage and general insurance supervision, Nausicaa Delfas(both correct), said: ‘Sale and rent back is often the last resort for struggling homeowners so we expected to see firms treating their customers much better than this report suggests.

‘The resulting temporary closure of this market could have been avoided if sale and rent back firms had taken the time to fully understand their regulatory responsibilities and customers’ needs.

‘It seems most were more focussed on their own commercial success rather than the welfare of the customers, with one firm even resorting to fraud.’

The FSA has found that SRB firms did not correctly assess whether the schemes were appropriate or affordable for the people involved. Customers were not given enough time to consider the agreement.

The sales processes were inadequate and did not allow firms to gather enough information to properly assess whether it was the best option for the family involved.

The promotion of the schemes were inaccurate, while the sales staff did not get the necessary training and were not competent.

A study published by consumer champion, Which?, a year ago found advice to SRB  customers was ‘woefully inadequate’.

Of the 17 advisers across nine firms contacted by Which? Money,  just two offered acceptable advice.

Which? chief executive, Peter Vicary-Smith, said: ‘It’s welcome news that the FSA has taken action to stop people falling prey to shoddy advice from sale and rent back firms.

‘We exposed the shortcomings of this market last year, after our own investigation uncovered woefully inadequate advice.

‘We now want to see redress for those consumers who have been given poor advice by SRB companies, and for this to happen quickly.’
