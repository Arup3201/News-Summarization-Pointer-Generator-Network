The leader of a labor union that represents 12,000 U.S. immigration officials launched a frontal assault against the White House on Tuesday, asking Americans to oppose what he said is a plan to unilaterally open the door to a flood of new immigrants after the Nov. 4 election.

Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, warned in a rare public policy statement that America's immigration tensions are 'about to get exponentially worse – and more dangerous' if the federal government expands, as expected, the numbers of green cards and work permits it issues to foreign nationals.

President Barack Obama has promised to make a move on immigration policy this year, but his timetable and mechanics are a popular Washington, D.C. guessing game whose ramifications touch on next week's election and the possibility of a December budget stalemate that could shut down the federal government.

Palinkas warned Tuesday, however, that the state of play – and his army of paper-pushers – are working in the president's favor.

'We are still the world's rubber-stamp for entry into the United States – regardless of the ramifications of the constant violations to the Immigration and Nationality Act,' Palinkas said.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO AND THE UNION'S MESSAGE

US Citizenship and Immigration Services officials are in charge of issuing documents to immigrants – a task their union chief fears will grow by orders of magnitude if President Obama makes good on his promises

The fate of border-crossers and other illegal immigrants in the US – 11 million of them at least – hangs in the balance as the president mulls his political options 

His union's members, all of whom work for the Department of Homeland Security, staff 223 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) field offices around the world where visa applications and asylum requests are processed and citizenship decisions are rendered. 

Their union is a bargaining unit of the American Federation of Government Employees, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. 

'Whether it's the failure to uphold the public charge laws, the abuse of our asylum procedures, the admission of Islamist radicals, or visas for health risks,' he said, public safety is already 'being endangered on a daily basis.'

Palinkas is known inside the beltway as a consistent thorn in the side of Democrats who want to expand work-visa programs and create new guest worker designations, both of which were part of a Senate immigration reform proposal that stalled in the House of Representatives last year.

The bill, which the White House shepherded through the Senate with the help of a 'Gang of Eight' lawmakers – four Democrats and four Republicans – would have attached those conditions to the GOP's demands for more border security. It would also have put millions of illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship. 

When the House adjourns on December 12, that legislation will be a dead letter. But Obama has pledged to take action on his own if the Capitol Hill stalemate persists.

Part of that action may have been spelled out in a draft proposal published this month, which spelled out USCIS's intention to purchase the paper stock required to produce as many as 34 million new documents – a combination of work permits and 'green cards,' the paperwork that authorizes immigrants to live and work in the United States.

According to the solicitation, the agency will look for a company that can produce a minimum of 4 million cards per year for five years, and 9 million in the early stages.

The company that wins the contract must be equipped to handle a 'potential "surge" in ... demand for up to 9M (9 million) cards during the initial period of performance to support possible future immigration reform initiative requirements,' it reads.

Palinkas said Tuesday that his union members are already seeing an increase in the numbers of interviews they are expected to complete, putting national security at risk. 

34 MILLION new cards: USCIS has drafted a solicition for bids to sell the government enough raw materials to produce 34 million new green cards and work permits, including a 'surge' of 9 million in the early days after a government policy shift

'There are plans,' he warned, 'to waive interviews of applicants who seek adjustment of their status in the U.S. to ready our workforce for the coming onslaught of applications unforeseen in previous administrations.'

Americans, he said, should 'act now to ensure that Congress stops this unilateral amnesty. Let your voice be heard and spread the word to your neighbors.'

'We who serve in our nation's immigration agencies are pleading for your help – don't let this happen.'

It's unclear what Republicans could do to counter the White House if the president decided to create new paperwork options for millions of people to emigrate to the U.S.

It's likely they will take over the U.S. Senate in January, but Obama would be signing any executive order against the backdrop of a lame-duck session of Congress in which Democrats would retain temporary control.

It's also possible that Senate races in Georgia or Louisiana could go to runoffs, leaving the Senate gavel up in the air while Obama readies his signature. 

If Republicans do secure 51 or more Senate seats on Election Day, they will hold most – but not all – the cards.

The latest congressional budget resolution kept the government's bills paid through December 11, a date that the president could hold over the GOP's head in order to win immigration concessions. 

Two political analysts, one who works with Democrats and another who services Republican clients, agreed in background conversations with MailOnline that the White House will likely use the threat of a government shutdown as leverage, even if the Democrats have already been demoted to a Senate minority.

Republicans will need an uncharacteristic show of party unity, the two analysts agreed.

Major constituency: Immigrants' rights groups are a large part of the Democratic Party, a faction the president can't afford to string along forever as the GOP grooms new Hispanic candidates to take the national spotlight

'The White House is really counting on disarray in the GOP,' the Democratic operative said. 'This is the gang that couldn't shoot straight, and the president is waiting for them to squabble their way to chaos. Who's against "amnesty"? Who's part of the Gang of Eight? Who's in bed with the business lobby that wants cheap labor? Obama's team thinks they'll get what they want because no one will be able to stand in a straight line on the other side.' 

Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, told party activists during a conference call on Monday that the GOP establishment is moving to the right and embracing the tea party's position.

'It's unconstitutional, illegal, and we don’t support it,' Priebus said of an executive order granting amnesty to illegal immigrants, according to Breitbart.com. 

'I don’t support it. It is wrong,' Priebus said. 'It is un-American for a president to try and do such a thing. I want to make it clear: There is no part of me, there is not a molecule in my body that agrees with the president on executive amnesty.' 

A Republican campaign adviser told MailOnline that Obama will have to 'lick his wounds and take this one in the teeth if the Democrats lose the Senate. He's just not going to antagonize the majorities of both houses of Congress with a massive immigration executive order.'

'He has two years left in office, and he's going to have to learn how to cross the aisle,' the operative said. 'If he does this amnesty thing, no one on Capitol Hill takes his phone calls and his legacy goes to pieces.'
