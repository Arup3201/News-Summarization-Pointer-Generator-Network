A Chinese hospital is being investigated for human organ trafficking after a patient claimed they stole one of her kidneys.

Factory worker Wai Jianmin, 29, was admitted to Shenzhen Guangsheng Hospital, in China's Guangdong province, for a routine operation to remove a blockage in her urinary tract on August 23.

But when she came round from the procedure she was shocked to learn that her kidney had been removed.

Removed: Ms Jianmin's kidney, which a surgeon claims was bleeding

The surgeon told her that the kidney had begun to bleed and was removed to save her life.

Ms Jianmin was highly suspicious, however.

She said: ‘I was worried because there had never been anything wrong with my kidney and yet here was the doctor telling me out of the blue that it had to go.

‘But when I asked for a second opinion or to transfer to a different hospital he told me that if I didn't have an operation I would die so I reluctantly signed the forms.’

After the operation, Ms Jianmin’s suspicious family asked for independent tests on the kidney, which, they claim, had mysteriously disappeared from the hospital.

‘I think they took my kidney and did something with it. They tried to hush me up by offering me money and compensation, but I want to know what went on,’ said Ms Jianmin, who has made a formal complaint to police and health officials.

A hospital spokesman said: ‘The kidney was removed in agreement with expert opinion and is now in storage at the hospital.’

Officials at the Shenzhen Health Inspection Bureau said: ‘We are investigating the allegations. There is no evidence of wrongdoing yet but we continue to interview people.’
