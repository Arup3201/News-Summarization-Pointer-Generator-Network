A 28-year-old man has been indicted in the murders of an elderly couple who believed they were meeting him to buy their dream car.

Ronnie 'Jay' Towns, who was arrested on January 26, was formally charged with multiple counts, including malice murder, felony murder and armed robbery, in Telfair County, Georgia on Monday.

Towns allegedly shot Marietta couple, Elrey 'Bud' Runion, 69, and his wife June, 66, after he responded to Mr Runion's Craigslist post seeking his dream car.

The grandfather was looking for someone willing to sell their 1966 Ford Mustang convertible; he had bought the same model after returning from the Vietnam War decades ago.

Indicted: Ronnie 'Jay' Towns, pictured in court in January, has been indicted in the deaths of an elderly Georgia couple. They were killed after Towns allegedly told them he had a car they were interested in buying

After receiving a response from a potential seller, the couple set out for Telfair County to check out the car. They were last seen taking their evening trip on January 22.

According to the indictment, Towns met the couple and, brandishing a weapon, stole their phones, Mr Runion's wallet, his wife's purse and  the couple's SUV, the Macon Telegraph reported.

Their SUV was found submerged in a pond near Towns' home  several days later, and the couple's bodies were found along a nearby dirt road. They had been shot in their heads.

Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson has previously said that robbery appears to be the motive for the killings. He said investigators found no evidence he had the sort of car the couple had been seeking.

On Monday, Towns' attorney, Franklin J. Hogue, told the Macon Telegraph that his client, who worked in construction and has a wife and a two-year-old daughter, had not confessed to anything. 

Killed: Bud and June Runion, who had been married for 38 years, were found shot dead along a dirt road in Georgia in January, several days after they left their home to meet a potential car seller

Beloved: The couple, who ran their own charity, left behind three daughters and three grandchildren

Hogue called Towns, who has no prior criminal record, 'very courteous and polite'.

Towns will return to court on April 9 for a bond hearing and on June 25, he will appear at an arraignment, where he will plead guilty or not guilty to the charges.

At that hearing, prosecutors will also reveal if they plan to seek the death penalty.

The beloved couple, who had been married 38 years, left behind three daughters and three grandchildren, according to their obituaries.

They ran a charity called Bud's Bicycles which had helped people in need from storm-damaged Alabama towns and impoverished pockets of West Virginia to their hometown in suburban Atlanta.

'He said, "You can't take money with you when you're gone,"' the couple's daughter, Brittany Patterson, told the Associated Press in January. 'You might as well spend and enjoy it.'

Dream car: Mr Runion had posted an advert on Craigslist looking for a 1966 Ford Mustang Convertible - a car he had bought after returning from Vietnam decades earlier. Towns allegedly told them he had one

Found: The couple's SUV, pictured, was found submerged in a pond near Towns' home several days later

She recalled how, years ago, Runion drove past two young girls sorting through a Dumpster on Christmas Eve. He fixed up two bicycles belonging to his own girls and delivered them as gifts.

It was the beginning of 'Bud's Bicycles,' a charity run loosely out of Mount Paran Church of God in Marietta. Runion met his wife, a teacher, at the church in the 1970s.

Neighbors said the Runions built a shed in their backyard to house the bikes. Their donations eventually expanded to include food, household and school supplies, coats and blankets.

'Basically, he had a food pantry in the basement of their house,' Patterson said.

She added that her father had served in Army's 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam, though he never talked to her about the experience in detail.

'He's a survivor and fighter, and I know he wouldn't have gone out without fighting and trying to protect my mother,' she said.
