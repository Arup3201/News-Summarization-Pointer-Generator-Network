From wasps buzzing around your jam sandwiches to an unscheduled interaction with a crab, a day at the beach comes with more hazards than most of us would like.

But at least you no longer have to put up with a gritty, sandy picnic blanket thanks to a company that uses military technology to keep the annoying grains at bay.

The sand-free rug, Â£34.99, was created by American company, CGear Sand-Free, and uses special technology to keep pesky grit and other spillages away.

Is this the end of sandy sarnies? Out-Right Gear claims their rug will repel sand thanks to its special weave

Multiple uses: The technology has been used by CGear for everything from mats to beach bags

Despite the impressive name, CGear technology is based on something very simple.

A unique type of woven mesh, the technology makes it impossible for sand or other grit to accumulate on top of the mat or rug.

Instead, grains of sand fall through specially designed holes, where they are rendered unable to come back up.

Although CGear originated in the Australian military, it is now used by armed forces across the world - including the UK's.

Originally developed for use by the Australian military, the key to the rug's success is in the multi-weave which means sand 'sifts' through and back to the ground.

The technology behind the rug was originally used by helicopter crews who used it to make moveable heli-mats.

Mats made using CGear Sand-Free were intended to prevent dust and dirt thrown up by whirring blades - better known as 'brownout' - from ending up inside the helicopter where it can cause damage to equipment.

Brownout can also temporarily blind helicopter pilots by obscuring their view. As a result, during the conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and North Africa, brownout was blamed for three in four accidental helicopter crashes.

Now the technology has found a more down-to-earth application in the shape of camping carpets, ground sheets and even a beach bag.

According to Out-Right Gear, which sells the CGear rugs in the UK, traditional camping equipment leaves you 'vulnerable to dirt, sand and dust kicked into and accumulating in your camping space.'

It suggests laying out your sand-free rug with a blanket placed over the top to make it more comfortable, although it does warn that a gap between the edge of the sand-free mat and the traditional one is needed to make it work.

The rug itself, belying its cheerful green and blue tartan design, is made from specially woven water-resistant PVC, which, says the company, also means spillages and mess are also kept at bay.

While the resulting combination will be a bit heavier than other picnic blankets, many will think it well worth it for sand-free sarnies.
