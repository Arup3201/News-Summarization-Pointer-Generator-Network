A man convicted as a teenager in the slaying of a special education teacher in 2000 has been released from prison after his murder conviction was overturned on DNA evidence.

Lorenzo Montoya, 29, pleaded guilty on Monday to being an accessory in the killing of Skinner Middle School teacher Emily Johnson, then 29, in Denver, Colorado.

He was sentenced to ten years in prison but was immediately released because he had already served 13 years and seven months of his life sentence. Four of those years, he spent in solitary confinement.

His defense attorney Lisa Polansky told MailOnline today that Montoya 'had no hard feelings' and 'was one of the most gracious people she had ever met'.

The lawyer said: 'He's not angry. That's not how he wants to be.'

She described the moment Montoya walked out of court as him 'being like a kid all over again'. She said that he had been told about the Internet but was now learning all about it. 

Montoya planned
 to move away from Denver and bad influences from his youth, complete 
his GED and learn a trade.

Ms Polansky added: 'He's thinking about what he wants to do when he grows up.'

Montoya had always denied killing Ms 
Johnson or stealing her car but admitted to going for a joyride in the vehicle the following day.

Ms Johnson, 29, was beaten to death at her home by Nicholas Martinez, then 16, when he stole her brand-new Lexus.

The following day, Montoya, then 14, along with others in the neighborhood, took a ride in the car which Martinez told some people he had bought and to others admitted he had stolen.

Montoya was brought in for police questioning over the stolen car in the company of his mother.

When she left the room, a detective aggressively hounded the teenager, Ms Polanksy said today, forcing a confession. Montoya's police statement was disallowed at his murder trial.  

However Montoya, then 15, was convicted of murder and other charges and sentenced to life without parole in an adult prison. He spent four years in solitary confinement.

The teenager was convicted after the 
prosecution convinced the jury that a sneaker print and a Bronco jacket 
found in the house belonged to Montoya.

However forensic testing carried out by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, at the request of Ms Polansky and her team at the Center For Juvenile Justice, found no DNA belonging to Montoya on either item. 

Ms
 Polansky took on Montoya's case free of charge in 2011 and brought it 
back to court by arguing that his initial lawyer had failed him.

The 29-year-old was cleared on the new DNA evidence. Montoya
 decided not to opt for a new trial, which could have taken several 
years to come to court, and took the DA's offer of a guilty plea to 
accessory to murder.

The
 victim's family asked for privacy but have previously said that if Ms 
Johnson was alive, she would want Montoya to have a second 
chance. 

Martinez was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
