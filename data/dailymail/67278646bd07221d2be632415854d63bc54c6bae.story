A newly discovered dinosaur that lived 100 million years ago has been unearthed by palaeontologists.

Experts believe it is one of the largest species of meat-eating dinosaur that ever lived in North America and was the top predator before the Tyrannosaurus rex.

The dinosaur, Siats meekerorum, has been named after a cannibalistic monster of Red Indian legend, called Siats, which closely resembled a T-Rex.

The ‘man eating monster,’ which is described in the latest issue of Nature Communications, is thought to have measured up to 40 feet long and weighed around seven tonnes.

Palaeontologists think that it was only when Siats meekerorum became extinct that T-Rex was able to become the apex predator.

The fossilised remains of the newly discovered species were found near Green River in the Badlands of Utah.

The dinosaur discovered was a juvenile when it died, but is thought to have measured 30 feet long and weighed 9,000 pounds.

Palaeontologist Dr Lindsay Zanno, of North Carolina State University, said: ‘This dinosaur was a colossal predator second only to the great T-Rex and perhaps Acrocanthosarus in the North American fossil record.

‘It has been 63 years since a predator of this size has been named from North America. You cannot imagine how thrilled we were to see the bones of this behemoth poking out of the hillside.’

Siats meekerorum is one of the three 
largest dinosaurs ever discovered in the U.S. and a species of massive 
meat eaters called carcharodontosaurs which include the Argentinian 
Giganotosaurus.

The only other giant from North America 
is Acrocanthosaurus, which stalked the eastern side of the country more 
than 10 million years earlier.

Dr Zanno discovered part of the 
skeleton of the new species with Dr Peter Makovicky of Chicago's Field 
Museum of Natural History during a 2008 expedition to an area known as 
Cedar Mountain Formation - a famous dinosaur graveyard.

It
 is now clear Siats' large size would have prevented smaller 
tyrannosaurs from taking their place at the top of the food chain.

Dr
 Makovicky said: ‘The huge size difference certainly suggests 
tyrannosaurs were held in check by carcharodontosaurs and only evolved 
into enormous apex predators after the carcharodontosaurs. disappeared.'

Dr Zanno said: ‘Contemporary tyrannosaurs would have been no more than a nuisance to Siats, like jackals at a lion kill. It was not until carcharodontosaurs bowed out the stage could be set for the evolution of T Rex.’

T-Rex evolved 30 million years later and weighed around twice as much as Siats meekerorum

The newly discovered species would have terrorised what is now Utah during the period known geologically as the Late Cretaceous between 100 million years and 66 million years ago and was previously unknown who the top meat eater was in North America at the time.

Dr Zanno said: ‘Carcharodontosaurs reigned for much longer in North America than we expected.’

The newly discovered species fills a gap of more than 30 million years in the fossil record when the top predator role changed hands from carcharodontosaurs in the Early Cretaceous to tyrannosaurs in the Late.

The lack of fossils left palaeontologists unsure about when this change happened and if tyrannosaurs outcompeted carcharodontosaurs, or were simply able to assume apex predator roles following carcharodontosaur extinction.

At the time, Siats dominated the landscape, which would have been populated by plant eating dinosaurs, turtles, crocodiles and giant lungfish and other predators such as early tyrannosaurs and several species of feathered dinosaurs that have yet to be described by the team.

Dr Makovicky said: ‘We have made more exciting discoveries including two new species of dinosaur. Stay tuned. There are a lot more cool critters where Siats came from.’
