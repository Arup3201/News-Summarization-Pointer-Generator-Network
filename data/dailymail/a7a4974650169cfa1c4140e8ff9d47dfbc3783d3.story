A teenage boy who'd gone into cardiac arrest was brought back to life by his friends, who were able to perform CPR thanks to a First Aid class they'd remembered from school.

Joel Massey, 14, had a heart attack and suddenly collapsed while playing football with his three friends Sam Seaborn, Rhodri Whittaker and Ben Stevens, all 16, near his home in Ledbury, Hertfordshire.

Joel’s heart stopped for ten minutes, but thanks to his friends’ quick thinking, he is expected to make a full recovery.

Joel suffers from congenial heart disease Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, an electrical defect which sometimes sees him suffer heart palpitations.

When he collapsed during a kick-about on April 12, his three friends were able to think back to a biology lesson on First Aid, and remembered what to do.

While Sam ran for help, Rhodri dialled 999 and Ben started performing CPR until an ambulance arrived.

Paramedics used a defibrillator to restart his heart and he was taken by ambulance to Birmingham Children's Hospital.

Joel
 was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White when he was 13, and although 
sufferers very rarely are at risk of cardiac arrest, those who are tend 
to be much older than Joel.

In Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, the heart beats abnormally fast due to an extra electrical connection in the heart.

It is one of the most common causes of an abnormally fast heart rate in infants and children, but although the syndrome is congenital, it is often not detected until the child is 10-13.

The heart of a person with WPW will suddenly suffer heart palpitations, before the heartbeat stopps or slows down abruptly.

The length and frequency of these episodes varies from person to person. In many cases, episodes of abnormal heart activity associated with WPW syndrome are harmless, don't last long and settle down on their own without treatment.

Today, Joel has been reunited with his best friends as they were awarded a certificate for their heroic actions.

He said: ‘I really can't remember any of it.

'I can remember earlier that day but all I know from what happened is what I have been told.

‘It has been frustrating being stuck in hospital now because I feel fine.

'I can't believe what the boys did. I am indebted to them really. They saved my life.

‘I think it has brought us all a lot closer together.’

Joel’s friend Ben carried out CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation after remembering a lesson he had in school the year before.

He said: ‘We'd had a bike ride and had stopped to play a game of football when Joel suddenly collapsed.

‘We thought he was mucking about at first so kicked the ball to him but he didn't react so we knew then that something was seriously wrong.

‘I think we just did what we did automatically; I don't think it really sunk in until Joel had been put in the ambulance.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a first aid technique that can be used if someone is not breathing properly or if their heart has stopped.

Always start with calling 999 before performing any type of CPR.  If you have not been trained in CPR, your should do chest compression only:

Try to perform 100-120 chest compressions a minute.

If you’ve been trained in CPR  you should give chest compressions with rescue breaths.

‘I
 had done some CPR as part of Duke of Edinburgh award scheme and we had a
 lesson about the heart in biology last year so I just did what I could.

‘Joel was sick as well so I knew we had to clear his airways and I did mouth-to-mouth.’

Joel's mother Andrea, 44, a nurse, said yesterday: ‘Joel is very lucky to have such good friends.

‘They saved his life, I hate to think what would have happened if he was on his own.

‘Everyone should learn how to do CPR because you never know when you'll need to use it.’

Joel is expected to be in hospital until Tuesday when he will undergo a cardiac ablation to repair his irregular heartbeat.

Cardiologist Dr Vinay Bhole, who is treating Joel, said: ‘With Joel's condition it is an extra electrical condition in the heart and mostly it didn't cause problems.

‘Certainly not heart attacks anyway.

‘The majority of young people don't collapse. But because Joel did we are going to do the operation to hopefully get rid of that extra electrical connection

‘If it is successful he will not need any more medication and if it is not then he will need another operation so we can try again.’
