South Korean
prosecutors on Monday sought the death penalty for the captain
of a ferry that capsized in April, leaving 304 people, most of
them school children, dead or missing, in a trial of 15 crew who
abandoned ship before it sank.

Lee Joon-seok, 68, charged with homicide, should be
sentenced to death for failing to carry out his duty, which in
effect amounted to homicide, the prosecution told the court
before resting its case in a trial that has taken place amid
intense public anger.

Sentiment turned sharply hostile after evidence surfaced
that the mostly teenage passengers waited in their cabins,
obediently following orders, as the crew escaped.

Lee was among 15 accused of abandoning the sharply listing
ferry. Four, including the captain, face homicide charges.

The rest face lesser charges, including negligence. A
three-judge panel is expected to announce its verdicts in
November. No formal pleas have been made but Lee has denied
intent to kill.

'Lee supplied the cause of the sinking of the Sewol ... he
has the heaviest responsibility for the accident,' the lead
prosecutor in the case, Park Jae-eok, told the court in the
south of the country.

The Sewol capsized and sank some 12 miles off the island of Byungpoongon, South Korea, during a routine voyage on April 16

'We ask that the court sentence him to death.'

The prosecutors sought life sentences for the other three
charged with homicide and prison terms ranging from 15 to 30
years for the rest.

The Sewol capsized and sank some 12 miles off the island of Byungpoongon, South Korea, during a routine voyage on April 16,
triggering an outpouring of nationwide grief and sharp criticism
of the government of President Park Geun-hye for its handling of
the rescue operation.

The crew on trial have said they thought it was the coast
guard's job to evacuate passengers. Video footage of their
escape triggered outrage, especially after survivors testified
they repeatedly told passengers to stay put.

After the prosecution rested its case, Lee apologised to the
families of the victims, saying he never intended to harm
anyone.

'I will repent until the day I die and ask for the victims'
families' forgiveness,' he said. 'I swear with my hand over my
heart, I did not intend to kill anyone. I never even thought of
such a thing.'

Most of the crew were represented by state-appointed
lawyers, who argued that the defendants were mostly too badly
trained to handle the disaster.

Some family members of victims who attended Monday's hearing
had called for the death penalty, but Amnesty International said
death was not the answer.

The Justice Ministry said 58 people were currently on death
row. The country last carried out executions in December 1997,
when 23 were hanged.

'While the South Korean court system has a reputation for
being fair, as do other legal systems around the world where the
death penalty still exists, public opinion can still creep in,'
Amnesty International's director of research for East Asia,
Roseann Rife, said.

'...The Sewol ferry accident was a great tragedy and if
negligence or human error was involved, those responsible should
be held to account. But the death penalty is not a solution.'
