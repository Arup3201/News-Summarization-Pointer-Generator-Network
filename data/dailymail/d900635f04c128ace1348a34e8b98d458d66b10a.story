SOUTHAMPTON 

Fraser Forster – 6

One shot on target from the visitors, but the England international couldn’t do anything about the goal. Dominant from set-pieces.

Blues substitute Didier Drogba stretches for the ball but he is unable to score past Fraser Forster

Maya Yoshida - 6 (Gardos 62, 6)

Alarm bells were ringing when the team sheets saw Yoshida up against Hazard, but he coped well, albeit with the help of several others. 

Jose Fonte - 7

Costa wasn’t able to out-muscle the Portuguese defender on this occasion and was quiet at St Mary’s.

Toby Alderweireld - 6.5 

Moved into the centre to deal with Costa, and as mentioned above Chelsea’s top scorer just couldn’t get into the game.

Cesc Fabregas goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by Southampton youngster Matt Targett

Matt Targett - 6

Another English left back from Southampton’s academy, sound familiar? The Saints may have another star on their hands after a solid first Premier League start.

Morgan Schneiderlin - 6.5 

Superb all game until two sloppy tackles in the second-half which saw him sent off.

Victor Wanyama 6.5 

Cut out spaces well in midfield and a dominant physical presence as always.

Steven Davis - 6 (Long 77, 6)

The midfield runner, and run he did. Mikel probably wasn’t needed to deal with his attacking threat 

Sadio Mane raced past Chelsea's defence before lifting the ball over Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois

Saido Mane - 7

Took his goal superbly, his pace troubled John Terry all afternoon. Two in two for the Senegalese summer signing.

Dusan Tadic - 7 (Ward-Prowse 58, 6)

Has struggled with injuries of late but the Saints look much more dangerous with him in the side.

Graziano Pelle - 6

Tough for their top scorer today. Often isolated, Pelle was booked for a frustrated tackle late on. 

Manager - Ronald Koeman: 7

Chelsea captain John Terry applauds the travelling Blues fans after the final whistle 

CHELSEA

Thibaut Courtois - 6 

Rarely troubled on Sunday and like Forster, couldn’t do anything about the goal. Always surprised when the ball gets past him. 

Branislav Ivanovic - 6

Solid but unspectacular going forward. In games like these, Chelsea could do with a real attacking threat from full back.

Gary Cahill - 6

Has been shaky in recent weeks but dealt with Pelle comfortably. The Italian’s game suited Cahill and Terry.

Fabregas was booked by Premier League official Anthony Taylor for an apparent dive

John Terry - 6

Experienced defender was left behind by Mane but other than that was faultless. 

Filipe Luis - 6

A few over-hit crosses didn’t help him in his time to shine. Cesar Azpilicueta shouldn’t worry too much.

John Obi Mikel - 5.5 (Drogba 74)

On hindsight, didn’t really need to be selected. Offers little to nothing going forward and even Matic is better defensively.

Nemanja Matic - 6 

A quiet game by his standards. Played alongside Mikel against Stoke but the partnership appeared uneasy this time. 

Andre Schurrle - 4 

Another poor game for the German who has been bereft of form since the World Cup. 

Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard jumps in the air after scoring his side's equaliser just before the interval

Cesc Fabregas - 7 

Unfortunate to be booked for simulation and, another assist for the former Barcelona man to add to his impressive collection.

Eden Hazard - 7.5 

Another brilliant goal by the Belgian who has been the league leaders' stand-out player this season.

Diego Costa - 6 (Remy 89) 

Kept quiet by Fonte and couldn't influence the game. Nothing really went right for him. 

Manager - Jose Mourinho: 6

Referee: Anthony Taylor 6.
