Just as Zumba was gaining notoriety as the hottest dance class to hit town, the group workout world has been hit by the ultimate fitness craze,The Jungle Body -  which promises to burn up to 700 calories in just one hour.

The Jungle Body has five different group classes - Konga, Vypa, Jagua, Tyga and Burn - and the main objective of the most popular class, Konga, is to walk out  drenched in sweat, aching from head to toe.

Unlike the highly coordinated Zumba classes, Konga is aimed at the average Australian woman and according to founder Tara Simich, the moves are 'really simple'.

Just as Zumba was gaining notoriety as the hottest dance class to hit town, the group workout world has been hit by the ultimate fitness craze,The Jungle Body - which promises to burn up to 700 calories in just one hour

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, the blonde bombshell said she can't believe the success she has achieved from her fitness classes, which started off as a hobby but have now won her countless awards. 

She is the 2014 WaToday Entrepreneur of the Year, the People's Choice Finalist & 2014 Telstra Business Woman Awards Nominee. Not to mention international recognition from Cosmopolitan Magazine and numerous fitness publications.  

Five years ago, the then 19-year-old Perth woman, was working in the US for boxer Wladimir Klitschko. As part of his new business venture, Simich's job was to research the hottest fitness trends.

The Jungle Body founder Tara Simich shows off the impressive results of her gruelling workouts 

She was inspired by the new workouts, including Zumba, which incorporates salsa and latin moves into their routines and wanted to create an ultimate fitness experience for the average Australian Mum.

On her return to Australia in 2010, she was 'shocked' at the lack of variety in group fitness workout classes and vowed to do something about it. 

The Jungle Body was born a few months later and is now enjoyed by hundreds of people in six countries across the globe including Finland, The UK and even as far as Saudi Arabia.

'I was shocked there was really nothing but LesMills and the majority of gyms only offered yoga and pilates so I saw a gap in the market for a different type of group fitness,' Simich said. 

450 instructors teach over 800 classes around the world and all ages from teenagers up to 60-year-old women attend the high intensity classes each day. 

The Konga is an all-in-one workout incorporating a bit of boxing, pilates, cardio and even dance. The aim of the routine is that you can do everything in that one hour so rather than going to separate classes, Konga gives you everything you need.

Simich and her team of dedicated instructors have been shaping women's bodies in Perth and are hoping to offer the classes to more and more people all over the world

Simich has been inundated with emails from women across the globe thanking her for their new toned bodies and posting their pictures on The Jungle Group's Facebook page with pride.

'So many people have found that it's helped them overcome depression and anxiety. The classes are so simple you feel like you've actually achieved something whereas classes that are too difficult make you feel worse,' she said. 

Simich could never have imagined the route her life would take when she was 19-years-old. She was studying Economics at Curtin University.

Simich is hoping to bring out a Jungle Body workout DVD in the next year 

'I was a dancer but I never ever thought it would be my career,' she said. 

Now she is a successful business woman, hoping to bring her fitness classes out on DVD in the coming year.

'We want to create a DVD and expand throughout Europe,' she said. 

'We want to be able to offer it to more and more people.'
