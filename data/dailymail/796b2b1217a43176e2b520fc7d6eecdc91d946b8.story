Thibaut Courtois named his dream five-a-side team in a recent questions and answers session on Twitter.

The Chelsea keeper decided to pick himself between the posts and picked two current Blues players in his line-up.

Courtois also selected two former Atletico Madrid colleagues in a five-a-side consisting of the best players he has featured alongside.

The Chelsea number one Thibaut Courtois has been in impressive form for the Blues this term

THIBAUT COURTOIS

The goalkeeper had to pick himself in the team. The keeper has been in fine form this season and has managed to fight off competition from Petr Cech to be Chelsea’s number one. 

The Blues signed Filipe Luis in the summer for £20m and has once again linked up with Courtois

FILIPE LUIS

Courtois played alongside the Brazilian left-back during his three seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid. They won the Europa League and La Liga together when they were played together in Spain and now both feature in Chelsea’s back four.

Atletico Madrid midfielder Koke was a player that caught the eye of Courtois in their time at the club

KOKE

The diminutive Spanish international has been an important part of Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid team and he clearly impressed Courtois too. Koke has been linked with a move to the Premier League but for now remains one of La Liga’s most impressive midfielders.

Eden Hazard has been in magnificent form for Chelsea and has scored 12 goals this campaign

EDEN HAZARD

The duo play together for the Belgian national team and Hazard has clearly left his mark on Courtois. The 24-year-old has scored 12 goals and made seven assists so far this term. He will continue to be a huge part of Chelsea’s title challenge.

Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao used to play alongside Courtois at Atletico Madrid

RADAMEL FALCAO

The Manchester United striker spent two years at Atletico Madrid before he moved to Old Trafford. He scored a hat-trick against Chelsea in the 2012 Super Cup final. Falcao moved to Monaco, the following campaign, and is now looking to earn a permanent move with Van Gaal’s side at the end of this campaign.
