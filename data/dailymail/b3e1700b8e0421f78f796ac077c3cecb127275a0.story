Big Wall Street firms are handing out pay raises, shortening hours and doling out perks to junior bankers fresh out of college in an attempt to stop them from defecting to startups and convince them to stay in finance.  

The big banks used to take it for granted that every year, top graduates would flock to Lower Manhattan and work long, grueling hours for the chance at high-power, high-paying jobs in finance.

But the 2008 financial crisis, cuts in bonuses and huge financial success of tech startups mean that many top graduates are shunning Wall Street for Silicon Valley. 

To compete, most of the big banks have raised starting salaries 20 to 25percent. 

Goldman Sachs and other big banks have realized that they can't take it for granted any longer that they'll get the best young talent

Goldman Sachs raised its starting salary for financial analysts from $70,000 a year to $85,000 a year. An entry-level banker for the firm can now expect to make $120,000 to $140,000 in the first year with bonuses, Bloomberg reports. 

'$120,000 a year is cheap labor for them,' Patrick Curtis, a former investment banker who now coaches students on how to break into finance, told CNBC. 

Goldman, long the most envied firm on Wall Street, once accepted that droves of Ivy Leaguers would flock to its ranks, willing to wok slavishly for long hours and on weekends. 

Now, Goldman is hiring more junior bankers in an effort to lighten the load so that young employees don't have to work as long.

And the firm has also added 'protected weekends' that are aimed at preventing new employees from checking email or worrying about the office from Friday night until Monday morning. 

Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have also raised starting salaries for junior bankers. 

Big banks are also lowering the emphasis on junior bankers leaving  to get an MBA. A graduate degree used to be all-but a requirement for advancement after two years on Wall Street. 

Now, some banks are discouraging junior bankers from going to school for fear that they'll never come back. 

Instead, they've begun handing out promotions to junior bankers with just an undergraduate degree. 

'They realized, why not keep them and promote them? Keep the organic talent,' Wall Street recruiter Andrea Baker told CNBC.
