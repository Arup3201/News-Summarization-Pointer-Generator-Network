Former Real Madrid and Brazil defender Roberto Carlos has confirmed that he has left Turkish side Sivasspor after 18 months in charge.

The 41-year-old became manager of the Super Lig club in June 2013 and led them to a fifth place finish in his first season.

But, with the club currently second bottom in Turkey's top-flight, Carlos has decided the time is right to move on.

Writing on his Instagram account, the ex-Fenerbahce full back said: 'Thank you very much for all this affection and requests to stay, but it is best for the club that I leave.

'I leave my heart with all of you. Thank you very, very, very much Sivas and Sivasspor.'

Carlos' decision came after his side were beaten 2-0 at home by Istanbul Basaksehir on Saturday.

Sivasspor's first game without Carlos in charge will be Tuesday's Turkish Cup clash with Gaziantep BB.

Carlos enjoyed a glittering playing career which included an 11-year spell at Spanish giants Real Madrid

Left back Carlos also made 125 appearances for Brazil and won the World Cup back in 2002
