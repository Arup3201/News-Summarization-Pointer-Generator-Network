They are spectacular scenes that would cause most people to seek shelter and hide in absolute fear, but one thrill-seeking primary school teacher is travelling the world to chase violent storms.

Inspired by the 1996 disaster film Twister, Valentina Abinanti risks her life to snap extraordinary photos of supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes.

The 31-year-old, from Galliate, Italy, voluntarily puts herself in front of storms that spawn twisters, enormous streaks of lightning and winds of more than 100mph.

Valentina has been photographing violent weather for more than a decade, and she has encountered more than 70 tornadoes and 400 storms.

In May 2013, she survived a deadly tornado in El Reno, Oklahoma.

The widest tornado in recorded history killed four fellow storm chasers and is remembered by the close-knit community as the darkest moment in storm chasing history.

With a width of 2.6 miles, the record-breaking F-5 tornado destroyed everything in its path with extreme winds of nearly 300mph.

In addition to the US, Valentina Abinanti chases storms in Italy; she spotted this massive waterspout in the coastal town of Vesima, near Genoa

By the time the tornado dissipated it left eight people dead and more than 150 injured.

Valentina’s photos are featured on her social media accounts, and they include many snaps from the feared Tornado Alley that cuts through several south-central US states.

Tornadoes in that region typically happen in late spring and occasionally the early fall, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Valentina Abinanti put her dream of becoming a storm chaser on hold while she studied to become a primary school teacher

The 31-year-old decided to pursue her goal of becoming a storm chaser in 2003, when she witnessed a tornado in her hometown in Italy

Valentina has also produced her own e-book and has set up a website, tornadoseeker.com, to promote her work.

She wrote on her blog: ‘Since childhood storms have always fascinated me. The sky darkens, the wind gets up, the threatening clouds thunder closer.

‘It was always a joy when I watched this show.’

Valentina Abinanti, from Galliate, Italy, said she has been fascinated by storms since she was a child

Valentina Abinanti was travelling with fellow storm chasers when she captured this image near Broadus, Montana, last May

After watching the film Twister, which follows a group of storm chasers, she vowed to become one herself.

She put her dream on hold for her studies, but began to teach herself about clouds and weather patterns after she witnessed a tornado near her hometown, west of Milan, in 2003.

In 2007, she joined a team of storm chasers who travelled to the US to photograph tornadoes, and has returned several times since then.
