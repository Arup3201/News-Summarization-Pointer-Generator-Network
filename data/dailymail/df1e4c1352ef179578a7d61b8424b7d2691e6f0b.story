Georgina Wilkin ended up in hospital with anorexia after being told she could hit it big if she lost inches from her hips

A former model for A-list designers has told how she ended up in hospital with anorexia after being told she could be the next big thing if she ‘lost a few inches’ off her hips.

Georgina Wilkin was an impressionable teenager when an agent made the remarks.

Months later, as she began to fall prey to anorexia, she was congratulated on her appearance after starving herself for 48 hours.

She was told that whatever she was doing to lose weight, she should ‘keep it up’.

Once a familiar face on catwalks, Georgina Wilkin turned her back on the fashion industry five years ago after her eating disorder put her in hospital.

Miss Wilkin, 23, described how she was spotted aged just 15.

She added: ‘When I first saw my agent he said “Georgina, you have so much potential to be amazing. There are just a few things you need to be aware of if you want to be a success – just a few inches off your hips, tighten up your waist and join a gym”.

‘Seems reasonable, right? But when you are a 15-year-old girl with dreams of hitting the big time these words don’t just slide off your back.’

Six months later, Miss Wilkin claimed she was already struggling with anorexia while modelling in Japan.

‘I am sitting on the floor of my apartment and I still don’t know where the supermarket is,’ she said.

‘I was given a working contract on the condition that on my flight date back I measured 24, 22, 34 at the bust, waist and hips.

'The week before I left, an agent beamed and said to me “Georgina, whatever you are doing, keep doing it” – I had not eaten for nearly 48 hours.’

She gave up modelling five years ago after she ended up in hospital

Miss Wilkin, who modelled for Prada and other top designers, said that in the end agents did not want to risk their reputation by hiring her and considered her ‘a damaged product’.

Now a personal assistant in London, she added: ‘It was not fair to tell a 15-year-old she has hippo hips and pass that off as constructive career advice.

'It is not right to excuse starvation under a promise of fame and fortune.’

She said her agent did sit her down and tell her she needed help when she became severely ill.

But she added: ‘They did not want to put my card out there as it would reflect badly on them. A model is a product and an agent is only interested in selling that product until you get to a point where you have blue lips.’

She modelled for three years after being spotted by agency IMG London at a lecture on photographer Mario Testino.

Miss Wilkin, who has overcome her anorexia, supports body image charity Beat.

Susan Ringwood of Beat said: ‘Fashion does not cause eating disorders but fashion can be toxic. We want the industry to embrace diversity.’

Miss Wilkin spoke at The Shape of Fashion debate in London on Wednesday hosted by online fashion retailer Asos.
