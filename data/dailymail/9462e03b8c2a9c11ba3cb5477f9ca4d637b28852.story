The ‘Scottish aristocrats’ accused of collecting food stamps, welfare and Medicaid from Florida and Minnesota while living a life of luxury have been deported from the Bahamas and taken into custody in Fort Lauderdale.

Colin
 Chisholm III, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, are currently being held in a Florida jail without bail as they await probable extradition to Minnesota.

The ‘Lord and Lady’ are accused of taking more than $167,000 in government benefits over a seven-year period.

Colin Chisholm III, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, are currently being held in a Florida jail without bail as they await probable extradition to Minnesota

They had been on the run for about six weeks, when on Monday they were visited in Freeport on Monday by police who told them their visas had expired, reports the Orlando Sentinel.

The police escorted the couple, their young son and dog onto a ship headed to Fort Lauderdale, where they taken into custody.

They went peacefully. Their son and dog were turned over to other family members.

The couple claimed to be wealthy 
Scottish aristocrats while living in the community of Deephaven, Minnesota, where authorities pledged last week to do everything in their power to bring them to justice.

'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, have been charged with $165,000 in welfare fraud while it is alleged they were living on a $1.2million yacht in Florida

The couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus and beach property in Florida

'These were rich folks ripping off the 
system,' Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a press 
conference on Friday. 'I will make sure they do hard time.'

While probation is the lightest sentence allowable for the charges of welfare fraud, Freeman vowed to push for prison time, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports.

'I can’t imagine a judge in this district allowing the Lord and Lady to get probation,' Freeman quipped.

The maximum sentence is a $100,000 fine and 20 years behind bars.

Along with the 
million-dollar yacht called the Andrea Aras, the couple have a grand, 
six-bedroom lakeside home, a beach property in Florida and a $30,000 
Lexus, investigators found.

Colin
 Chisholm III, claims he is from a long line of Scottish aristocracy and
 is a wealthy broadcasting executive, according to court filings.

Tough sentence: Hennepin County, Minnesota Attorney Mike Freeman announced at a press conference Friday. 'I will make sure they do hard time.'

The Chisholms also had $3 million in bank accounts which they failed to declare, according to Hennepin County Attorney's office.

The couple were receiving public assistance for their medical care and food stamps in Minnesota for years while also allegedly collecting welfare in Florida.

According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps.

Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be desitute. 

In the welfare applications, the couple allegedly lied about where they were living and who they were living with.

Colin Chisholm did not declare that he 
ran a business nor Lady Chisholm that she had a dog kennel which breeds 
championship-worthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels.

Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, of Deephaven, Minnesota, have been charged with wrongfully obtaining $165,000 in welfare and are still at large

Lady Chisholm is alleged to have claimed for state prenatal care despite having millions of dollars in the bank

According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands.

Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Carribbean.

More than $1 million dollars flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, the complaint states.

The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005.

However for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim.

In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. 

In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker.

Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, Eloise Heidecker and the Chisholms were evicted from the home.

They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views.

The couple moved to a lakefront property on Lake Minnetonka in 2008 - all the while raking in thousands in welfare payments

The home, built in 1909, is believed to have six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres.

None
 of these details were declaired on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea 
Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her 
elderly grandmother. 

Hennepin
 County Attorney Mike Freeman said on Friday: 'It is truly outrageous 
when persons of considerable means steal from the government and all of 
us taxpayers through abusing the social welfare system.

'We will prosecute this case with all the capacity we have.'

Hennepin
 County’s Human Services and Public Health Department terminated all 
welfare benefits to the Chisholms at the end of March 2012.

Prosecutors
 will ask that the judge be allowed to impose a longer sentence than the
 Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines call for because the Chisholms 
committed a major economic offense.
