Bernie Madoff's daughter-in-law has revealed how her husband gushed about their future in a romantic wedding anniversary card - just two months before he killed himself.

Stephanie Madoff Mack’s disclosure comes one year after Mark Madoff, 46, was found hanged in his New York loft apartment - as their two-year-old son Nicholas slept in the next room.

The suicide fell on the second anniversary on the arrest of his father, disgraced financier Bernie Madoff, who is serving a 150-year sentence for masterminding a $60billion financial scam.

In a blog post, Mack said her late husband had given her a card for their sixth anniversary bearing an optimistic message.

She revealed that, a year on, she is still confused about why her husband killed himself when he was so excited about their future.

‘Dear Stephanie,’ the card read. ‘Another year. Another great year. I am so happy waking up next to you. I am so happy that your smile is the last thing that I see before closing my eyes at night. So much to look forward to. I love you. Mark.’

Writing for the Huffington Post, she also recalled their conversation during their celebratory dinner.

Together: Writing a year after her husband's death, Stephanie Madoff Mack said their two young children, Nicholas and Audrey, still say they miss their father every day. She no longer speaks to the Madoff family

It ‘weighed the pros and cons of moving out of New York City to raise our two children in the suburbs’, she said. ‘We talked about possibly having a third child.’

She added: ‘What I remember about that 
dinner is that we were like any other normal couple, in love, 
celebrating their wedding anniversary.

For their sixth wedding anniversary, which they celebrated two months before his death, Mark Madoff wrote Stephanie a card, which read:

Dear Stephanie.

Another
year. Another great year.

I am so happy waking up next to you. I am so 
happy that your smile is the last thing that I see before closing my 
eyes at night.

So much to look forward to.

I love you.

Mark

‘We were not the son and daughter-in-law of Bernard Madoff, the man who turned our life upside down.’

She also described how she was still haunted by questions surrounding his death, which friends have said was borne out of Mark’s fear he would be locked up like his father.

‘His inner turmoil is something I still struggle with every day,’ she wrote. ‘I re-read his last email to me: "I love you" and his last email to his lawyer: "Please take care of my family" and still can make no sense of what he did. None.’

She also expressed her regret that he was not witnessing their two children, Nicholas and Audrey, growing up – and that the children spoke of him every day.

‘He should be here to see how big Nicholas has gotten,’ she wrote. ‘Their heads are the same shape, and Nick is always pushing his sleeves up the way Mark did. It makes me laugh, and then I immediately think: Mark should be here.

‘A day does not go by without either one telling me sadly that they miss Daddy.’

Tragedy: Officials carry Mark's body out of his New York apartment after he was found hanged by a dog leash

Death: The couple's 22-month-old son Nicholas was sleeping in the next room when Mark committed suicide

Ms Madoff Mack, who wrote a book entitled The End of Normal about her part in the family, has publicly fought with the rest of the Madoffs following the death of her husband.

After she continued to contact Bernie, his wife Ruth was banned from Mark’s funeral.

Mr Madoff was overwhelmed with grief and looked 'like someone had shot him in the stomach' when he heard that Mark had committed suicide, a fellow inmate said.

After her husband's Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008, Ruth was warned by her sons Mark and Andrew to leave him or lose contact with them

Divided: The Madoff family, (L-R) Ruth, Bernie, Andrew and Mark, were torn apart by the arrest. Ruth, who was banned from Mark's funeral, angered her sons when she continued to support her disgraced husband

At the time she chose her sons.

But after Mr Madoff was attacked in prison in 2009 she returned to his side, and her furious sons then severed all ties with her.

Mr Madoff revealed earlier this year that his family no longer speak to him following his multi-billion-dollar fraud.

Ruth has stopped visiting in a bid to salvage a relationship with her second son, Andrew.
