A manhunt has been launched to find a pregnant woman who vanished a week before her due date.

Aubrey Andrews, 20, left her husband and three-year-old son at home in Sacramento, California, when she drove off 'distraught' at 10pm on December 6.

She has not been seen since and the next day her purse appeared on the family's porch.

Missing: Aubrey Andrews, 20, has gone missing a week before she was due to give birth to her second son with husband Edward Andrews, pictured right with Aubrey. She had suffered from post-partum depression

Her husband of three years Edward Andrews cried as he said he thought she was going to a friend's house and now thinks she may have fled.

Mrs Andrews, he added, suffered post-partum depression.  

Police have been unable to trace Mrs Andrews and she has not checked into any of the local hospitals.

'If she doesn’t want to be here, she doesn’t have to be,' he told KTLA.

Emotional appeal: Mr Andrews said he thought she was driving to a friend's house and now he's scared

Family life: The couple, married for three years, have a three-year-old son at their home in Sacramento, CA

'But at least let us know. Tell us you went somewhere, that you’re safe.

'The baby could come at any time at this point.'

Mrs Andrews had allegedly become frustrated with doctors' orders to stay and home and rest in the time leading up to her due date.

She has not used her bank card since driving away in her white Toyota Prius and her cellphone goes direct to voicemail.

Police are treating her disappearance as 'unusual' but not suspicious.

Wanted to get out: Mrs Andrews had been frustrated at having to stay in and relax, Mr Andrews told reporters

They believe she may have traveled to south California where she has family and friends.

In an appeal for information on her whereabouts, police described Mrs Andrews as Filipina, 5'1", weighing 150lbs.

She has hazel eyes and black hair with golden blonde highlights.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Sacramento Police Department at 916-264-5471.
