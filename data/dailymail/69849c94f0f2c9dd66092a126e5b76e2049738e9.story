As the start of a much-anticipated English season edges ever closer, the Premier League have launched a promotional video advertising the 2014/15 season.

The clip, titled 'The Ultimate Stage' is fronted by Homeland actor David Harewood, and features several of the league's best players.

 Eden Hazard (Chelsea), Pablo Zabaleta (Manchester City), Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Juan Mata (Manchester United), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool) and Tim Howard (Everton) all star, while Jose Mourinho rounds the video off.

The season starts on Saturday, with Manchester United kicking off proceedings with an early game against Swansea City.

And if the last campaign was anything to go by - as well as the transfer dealings so far this summer - it promises to another cracker.

The title race is poised to be tight with five (or more) potential contenders, and 12 teams are being tipped by bookmakers to be in a relegation battle.

And the latest promotion is sure to get fans excited all around the world. Daryl Goodrich, the man behind the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games bid campaign films, directed the film, while Premier League Director of Sales and Marketing, Richard Masters says he can't wait to get started.

'We hope that The Ultimate Stage video will whet the appetite of Barclays Premier League fans all over the world on the eve of the new season.

'The competitive and compelling football the clubs and players provide is really captured in this film. The drama begins tomorrow and, like the fans, we can't wait.' 

The opening weekend is almost upon us. So as the video says, let the drama begin.
