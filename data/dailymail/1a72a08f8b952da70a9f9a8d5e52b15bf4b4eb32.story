A baby girl was born to save her six-year-old big brother suffering from terminal leukaemia... and doctors have found her to be a perfect donor match.

Wang Cansen was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of four and he initially responded well to treatment.

But when the cancer later returned, doctors informed his parents that without a transplant, he would die, according to The People's Daily.

After failing to find a suitable donor to save Cansen's life, his parents decided to have a second baby 

Cansen's parents tested themselves and other relatives, but the search for a suitable donor proved fruitless.

After learning that a brother or sister would be a possible donor, Cansen's parents decided to have a second baby.

But with China's tough one child policy in place, his father Wang Jiyong and mother Liu Chunping had to apply for special permission to have a second baby - which was granted.

And they were delighted when doctors told them that their new baby daughter Wang Fanyin, born on January 13, is a suitable match.

Despite his age, Cansen is well aware that his illness is life-threatening and that his baby sister was born to save him. 

When his mother was still pregnant with his sister, the little boy touched his mum’s belly and said he would protect his sister forever. 

After being told she could save him, he said: 'I am happy that I will now live longer, and plan to dedicate all my life to making sure my sister who has saved mine is happy.' 

He has two dreams: to grow up to become a solider and to go back home to spend some time with his mother and new sister.

Doctors have been able to save samples from the baby girl's placenta and umbilical cord which will be used to give life-saving treatment to her brother.

Wu Chang, a hospital spokesman, said doctors had supported the parents in their desire to have a second child.

He said: 'Extracting stem cells was relatively risk-free and painless for both mother and newborn, and offered life to the existing son as the operation has an extremely high success rate.'

The operation is now scheduled to take place later this month.

Stem cells taken from blood and tissue  in the umbilical cord can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including various forms of cancer.

Cord blood and cord tissue stem cells are considered to be one of the most promising sources of future medical treatments. 

The first successful cord blood stem cell transplant to treat Fanconi's Anemia took place in 1988. 

Since then, the list of conditions where stem cells are standard therapy has grown to include various forms of Leukaemia and Neuroblastoma, as well as conditions of the blood and the immune system.

More than 30,000 cord blood transplants have been performed worldwide and there are more than 300 clinical trials underway.
