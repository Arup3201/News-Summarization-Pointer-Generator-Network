the beginning of the year.

Visitors
will have the opportunity to learn about the story behind each gown, 
including one which cost a mere £110, and one which was designed by the 
husband.

One star had her 
dress adorned with black crystal roses while another bought the very 
first one she tried on - and another got married in lilac.

The
dress exhibition is part of Brides The Show where visitors can shop for
their own gown among designer collections, sip on champagne at the 
Laurent-Perrier Champagne Bar and learn bridal beauty with one-to-one 
make-up lessons with Bobbi Brown make-up artists.
