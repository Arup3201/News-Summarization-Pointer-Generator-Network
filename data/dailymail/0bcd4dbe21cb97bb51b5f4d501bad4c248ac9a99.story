This week, Woolworths have launched a new campaign to sell misshapen produce as a means of offering better deals.

The supermarket chain has kicked off The Odd Bunch initiative nationally this week, offering seasonal savings on the lumpy and misshapen counterparts of your favourite fresh foods.

It comes three months after Harris Farm launched a comparable operation, The Imperfect Picks range, which offered up to 50 per cent off produce with minor visual imperfections.

Woolworths has kicked off The Odd Bunch initiative nationally this week, offering seasonal savings on the lumpy and misshapen counterpart’s of your favourite fresh foods.

Donald Keith, senior category manager for Woolworths, said ‘we wanted to introduce a unique collection of produce which is normally thrown away, and offer it for a markedly lower price’

It is believed about 25 per cent of fresh produce is discarded due to imperfections or cosmetic damage.

Donald Keith, senior category manager at Woolworths, said the campaign was launched with customers and farmers in mind.

‘We wanted to introduce a unique collection of produce which is normally thrown away, and offer it for a markedly lower price,’ he said.

Mr Keith said this puts more money back into the hands of Australian farmers, as well as Woolworths shoppers.

‘Imperfections are generally caused by extreme weather, be that rain or heat. What doesn’t fit the criteria just gets thrown out.’

‘We will now be able to help farmers continue to sell during these tricky periods’ Mr Keith said.

This week, the Odd Bunch campaign is offering Carrots, Onions and pears, but the offerings are expected to grow.
