Mahatma Gandhi's grandson has blasted the shooting of Michael Brown and 109 other people in St Louis this year.

Addressing hundreds of mothers gathered at a silent march today, Dr Arun Gandhi condemned prejudice in the city as a source of the violence, which has seen a 30 per cent leap in the number of annual homicides this year.

His words came amid fresh outcry over Michael Brown's shooting as it emerged the police officer who killed him has presented a favorable account of his actions - in a move that could see him escape charges.

March: Protesters assembled in St Louis,  Missouri, where the names of 110 slain citizens were read out

'We have looked at it only as racism, and racism is a byproduct of prejudice,' he said, St Louis Public Radio reported. 

'Prejudice exists in every one of us, whether we are black, white, brown, yellow. 

'Whatever our color, wherever we come from, we have prejudice. It is those prejudices that spawn these kinds of byproducts like racism and gender disparities and homophobia.' 

Rev Traci Blackmon addressed the crowds to list all 110 slain citizens since January this year before releasing balloons into the sky.

Standing outside the St Louis County Justice Center at midday today, the group held a four-minute silence for Michael Brown to recognize the four hours his body was left lying in the street after he was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson.

The protest urged mothers to make an emotional plea to police in a desperate bid to end violence in the city.

Their words followed Rev Al Sharpton's fierce speech this morning condemning police officer Darren Wilson, who claims he shot Michael Brown in self-defense.

Listing other black teenagers shot by white men, he also branded the shooting racist, and said: 'We were involved in Trayvon Martin. We were supportive of Jordan Davis.

'The strange thing is that all of them used the same excuse...The only gun there was Darren Wilson's! Strange parallels with all of these cases.' 

In his own version of events, revealed by the New York Times, the police officer told a grand jury he opened fire because the teenager was attacking him and he feared for his life. 

Wilson insists Brown viciously launched through the window of his police car, punching and scratching him repeatedly.

Police officers are generally given more scope for lethal force if they reasonably believe that their life is in imminent danger.

Eventually, Wilson said, he pulled his gun from the holster on his right hip, fired two shots, and one hit Brown's arm - leaving his blood smeared inside the car and on his uniform.

The account stops there and fails to explain why Brown was shot a further four times outside the vehicle. 

Since no other witness had a clear vantage point from which to see the incident, legal experts warn Wilson's testimony will carry significant weight for the grand jury, a legal expert told MailOnline. 

Slamming the account as illogical, Sharpton today raged at his weekly National Action Network rally in Harlem that it is the 'same excuse' as all other shootings of black citizens by white men.

'It sounds like a Michael Dunn defense,' he said, referring to the Florida man who has been convicted of first-degree murder for shooting dead black teenager Jordan Davis. Dunn claimed he did it because Davis was playing music too loudly.

'It didn't work in Florida and it shouldn't work in Missouri,' Sharpton added. 

He spluttered: 'First of all, if you stopped him - Michael Brown and his friend - walking down the street, what led to the scuffle? 

'Secondly, how does he and you get in your car? You trying to do what by yourself?' Sharpton asked. 

'Now, if I go with you with your story all the way to that - that Michael Brown was shot, gets up off you in the car - why are you trying to tell me that a man ran back at you when he knew you had the gun and you already shot him?'
