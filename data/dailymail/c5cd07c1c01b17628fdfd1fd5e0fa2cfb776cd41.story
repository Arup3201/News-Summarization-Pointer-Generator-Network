Philip Sheriff who died after he was bottled in the neck at the Pulse nightclub in Southwark, London

A gig-goer accused of murdering a Blackberry executive by slashing him in the neck with a broken glass bottle 'said he wished he had not done that', a court heard.

Philip Sherriff was at a star-studded party to watch Jessie J perform when he was fatally bottled after a row as he stood at a bar.

Ashley Charles, 26, seized a bottle of beer from the father-of-two then plunged it into his neck after an argument at the bar of the Pulse nightclub in Southwark, south London, the jury was told.

The court heard that Mr Sherriff, 37, had his back to the bar when Charles squeezed between him and a woman and words were exchanged, it was alleged.

Charles then became 'annoyed and irritated' before trying to snatch a phone from Mr Sherriff's hand just after midnight in April this year, the court heard.

He then grabbed the bottle from Mr Sherriff's hand, swung his arm out of view of CCTV cameras before bring to down towards the married father of two's face and neck.

Although the footage did not captured the moment the bottle was smashed, the Old Bailey jury was told Charles could have used a Blackberry display behind him to break it.

The beer bottle sliced through Mr Sherriff's left carotid artery and jugular vein and he began 'immediately and copiously to bleed.'

As those around Mr Sherriff tried to help him Charles was held by bouncers and he told one 'Is he ok? I wish I had not done that.'

He later told police who arrested him 'Yes I know. I bottled him. He retaliated me. I did not mean to harm him, I am sorry.'

Later he added: 'He kept pushing past me throughout the bar area. I felt intimidated so I just lashed out.'

Charles of Leicester denied murder.

Prosecutor Duncan Penny said: 'There 
is no question that this defendant choose to thrust this bottle right 
into the neck and face of a man who had been irritating and from whom he
had just snatched it.'

Describing the lead up to the alleged 
murder at the BlackBerry sponsored event he said: 'Towards the end of 
the event after artistes including Jessie J had finished performing Mr 
Sherriff was standing next to the bar.

'The defendant tried to get to the bar, he squeezed between Mr Sherriff and a female who was also standing there.

'CCTV
showed the defendant continued to jostle Mr Sherriff even after 
obtaining two bottled beers. Obtained not bought because it was a free 
bar.'

He told the jury 'one man was 
irritating the other. Words had been exchanged between them about a girl
who had been at the bar with them. One of them was joking about.

He added: 'One witness heard an 
argument between the defendant and Mr Sherriff which appeared to be 
related to the phone.

'CCTV showed the defendant twice lunging towards Mr
Sherriff's phone but he was not successful.

'The fatal attack however occurred 
seconds afterwards. The defendant took Mr Sherriff's bottle of beer from
his right hand.

'The defendant's hand moved out of camera shot before it 
came back into shot.

'He lunged at the left side of Mr Sherriff's neck. Various witnesses describe seeing the blow as a swipe or slash.

'Undoubtedly it all happened very quickly indeed. Perhaps no more than one second. One second to take a life.'

He added the forensic pathologist said the bottle had been smashed before it made contact with Mr Sherriff.

Mr Sherrif looked 'confused' and 
unaware he had been left with a 'big hole in his neck' after he was 
fatally injured, a witness told the jury.

A partygoer burst into tears as she 
described the moment Mr Sheriff 'just stared' as blood soaked his suit 
and his attacker tried to run away after severing his artery and jugular
vein with a broken bottle.

Lois
Craze told the Old Bailey that she first noticed the man approach the 
bar and next saw him trying to run away before being tackled by another 
reveller.

She turned to the bar to see Mr Sheriff standing there bleeding as people rushed to his aid.

She
told the court she and her three friends had decided to have one last 
drink before heading home to let the queue for the cloakroom die down.

The
group went into the bar just after midnight after the lights came on 
following the Brit Award winner finishing her set by the dance floor of 
the Pulse nightclub in Southwark, south London.

As
she stood 'people watching' while her friends fetched drinks from the 
bar she she noticed a man coming towards the bar on 'a bit of a 
mission'.

She said: 'When he approached the bar
I turned away and the next moment I turned back all I saw was that man 
walking very quickly away from the direction he came. Someone took him 
down to the floor.

'When I looked back this man 
at the bar turned round and his neck was open and bleeding everywhere. 
He was facing me at this point.

'He
was just standing there holding his neck and staring in the direction 
to where the man went, confused and almost as if he did not know what 
had happened to him. He was looking not angry or not even aware he had 
been hurt.

'I could see 
there was a big hole in his neck on the left side and there was blood 
everywhere. It was coming out very quickly and covered his suit jacket.

'His friend I guess that was at the 
bar looked over and saw what happened and noticed the blood and straight
away put his fingers on it. He held him up at the bar and tried to 
stabilise him.'

She said her friends rushed to help 
applying towels from the bar to the manâ€™s wounds as the man who was 
brought to the ground was taken away by bouncers.

Asked
what the man who had been hurt was doing she burst into tears and said:
'I could see his face clearly... he was just staring.'
