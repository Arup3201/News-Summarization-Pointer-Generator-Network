Out of a job? Amy Pascal is the co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, and may lose her job over emails leaked online in the recent company hack. Pictured above at the Los Angeles premiere of film The Interview

For calling Leonardo DiCaprio 'despicable' and being involved in an email exchange describing Angelina Jolie as a 'spoiled brat', Amy Pascal may lose her job. 

Hollywood has been an awkward place for the 56-year-old Sony executive ever since hackers released hundreds of company documents online - including her candid show-business emails.

The hack is thought to be a response to the release of Sony film The Interview, which makes fun of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. The group believed to be behind the attack has ties to the North Korean regime. 

And it seems the hack is doing the destruction the group envisioned, as sources told the New York Daily News that Pascal could be getting sacked for comments made in the private emails. 

'Amy will be getting fired to set an example,' the source told the Daily News on Saturday. 

'Everyone is really upset because Amy is beloved and a good person.' 

The anonymous source went on to say that Pascal's previously stellar reputation made the emails all the more surprising, and have damaged the company as a whole.

One of the most offensive comments made by Pascal in the emails, was in reference to President Obama's film preferences. 

In an email exchange about what she should talk to the president about at an event, she asked 'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' before going on to list other movies about slavery. 

For that racially-insensitive comment, Pascal issued a public apology to the White House and had to humble herself in a phone call with the Reverend Al Sharpton - who has become the president's private adviser on civil rights issues. 

'She kept saying over and over again that’s not who she is,' Sharpton told the Daily News about his chat with Pascal. 'She apologized over and over. But I told her that when I listen to the words, if they were said by somebody of another race about somebody of another race, they would not be tolerated.' 

And the president isn't the only one offended in her emails. Pascal also takes shots at Leonardo DiCpario and Angelina Jolie. 

DiCaprio was one of the main A-list actors trying out for a role in the studio's planned biopic of Steve Jobs.

It seems DiCpario was offered the role first but turned it down, with producer Mark Gordon emailing Pascal about the actor's 'horrible behavior'.

Pascal agrees, calling DiCaprio 'actually despicable'. 

She was also involved in a nasty exchange of words concerning actress Angelina Jolie.

The actress was insulted in an email exchange between Pascal and producer Scott Rudin, as the two got into an argument over whether director David Fincher should work on the Jobs biopic or a Cleopatra movie starring Jolie.

Rudin, who bought the script to the studios, wrote: 'YOU BETTER SHUT ANGIE DOWN BEFORE SHE MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR DAVID TO DO JOBS.'

Pascal then hit back: 'Do not f**king threaten me. I have been asking you to engage with me on this for weeks.'

To which Rudin responded: 'What the hell are you talking about? Who's threatening you? Let me remind you I brought this material to you and I can off her from it in a phone call. Don't for one second even think about trying this s**t with me.'

'There is no movie of Cleopatra to be made (and how that is a bad thing given the insanity and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me) and if you won't tell her that you do not like the script - which, let me remind you, SHE DOESN'T EITHER - this will just spin even further out into Crazyland but let me tell you I have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and I will tell her this myself if you don't.'

Pascal awkwardly had to face Jolie last week when the two attended the annual women in entertainment breakfast.

However, Jolie has since pulled out of promoting her new Sony-produced movie Unbroken, about an American Olympian taken  by the Japanese as a prisoner of war during World War II, citing a chicken pox infection.

Jolie even released a picture of herself, sores and all, but Sony executives say the illness is made up to spite Pascal. 

Other Sony secrets revealed in the hack, was the company's plans for a Ghostbusters remake, the entire script for the new James Bond movie and the salaries for actors like James Franco and Seth Rogen.
