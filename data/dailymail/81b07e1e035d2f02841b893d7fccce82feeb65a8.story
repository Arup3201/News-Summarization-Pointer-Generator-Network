Jim Soar, 53, suffers from cluster headaches

When did you last behave like a two-year-old in public? I mean the full tantrum package: red face, crying, wailing, shouting and stamping.

It was probably when you were a toddler. My last such performance was two months ago in a Sainsbury's car park, and I'm 53. Very undignified. In fact, bent over in agony on the driving seat of our car, I made such a racket that two concerned shoppers called an ambulance.

My excuse is that, like at least 60,000 others in the UK, I suffer from cluster headaches, which leave those they afflict in temporary agony. A cluster headache is unlike the headaches that almost everyone has from time to time - the pain is extraordinary: women who suffer from cluster headaches say it's worse than childbirth, and neurologists have described it as 'the most severe pain experienced by mankind'.

Attacks, while not life-threatening in themselves, are so excruciating that some sufferers have taken their lives, hence the alternative name 'suicide headaches'.

I am a fairly textbook case: I was 38 when my cluster headaches started - most sufferers are diagnosed in their 30s or 40s, and the condition is five times more common in men, though it's not clear why. The pain affects the face and head on just one side. During an attack, my left eyelid droops and my left nostril runs; others may have right-sided pain; a few find that it can swap sides. Again, no one knows why.

In my case, the epicentre shifts from my temple to the ear, eye socket and nose. It has troughs, peaks and plateaus, surging, almost vanishing, then returning redoubled. During an attack I can't think or speak.

To distract from the pain I pace, rock, chant, wail or sing. Any phrase or snatch of pop song will do. To any stranger watching and listening I must seem raving mad. But after the pain has fully escalated I don't care. Painkillers don't help - for me the only thing that can provide relief during an attack is breathing pure oxygen from a canister, via a mask.

Cluster headaches are one of a small group of so-called primary headaches, i.e. those for which no cause has yet been found. In some cases there is probably a genetic link (though no one else in my family has them) and they are more common in smokers (I was formerly a heavy smoker and still smoke a few cigarettes each day).

The pain comes from behind the sinuses, from a cluster of nerves called the trigeminal ganglia. Thanks to advanced scanning techniques, neurologists know that the impulses that set off the agony in these nerves originate in the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controls circadian rhythms - our 'body clock'.

The connection with body clock rhythms may help to explain the cluster headache pattern: they occur in bouts over a period of one to three months, once or twice a year. I've had one such bout a year, lasting six weeks, since 2000, normally from July to September.

Within this time, you experience any number of attacks. The attack frequency builds to a peak, then recedes. One day you feel a mild twinge, a few days later another, worsening until headaches happen about eight times a day, every day.My early attacks, though terrifying, were 15-minute wonders, each ending abruptly as if some invisible hand had flipped a switch from 'Torture' to 'Pain-free Bliss'. But by 2007 they were lasting 30 minutes and taking longer to subside. Last summer it was up to an hour.

You usually get less than a minute's warning. For some it's a droopy eyelid, for me a dull ache in the nose. After that it's downhill fast. At home, I try to reach an oxygen cylinder as fast as possible; it's the most reliable way to take the edge off, though it does little to quell the strongest spells.

Attacks make you sweat profusely, and between them you are exhausted - I also get nightmares throughout a cluster headache bout. My long-suffering wife, daughter and dog are all used to the different creature I become during a bout.

Yet it could be worse. Unluckiest of all are the 20 per cent of victims whose headaches never, or hardly ever, go away. They are said to have chronic cluster headache.

What triggers an attack is another mystery, though exercise, heat, strong sunlight and alcohol can all provoke a monster headache - alcohol especially, though outside a cluster bout it has no unusual effects.

The bad news for 'clusterheads' is that the condition is a lifelong curse. The good news is that periods of remission tend to lengthen with age and there is hope of major medical progress.

'It's not unreasonable to think a cure may be found,' says Professor Peter Goadsby, one of the world's leading experts on cluster headache, who is based at King's College Hospital, London. 'The brain knows how to stop the pain of an attack - it's us who don't. We have to find that piece of the puzzle.'

The Organisation for the Understanding of Cluster Headache (or, for short, OUCH - which hardly does justice to the agony sufferers endure), has helped to organise further brain-imaging investigations to try to discover why cluster headaches occur.

In Norway, scientists were able to numb the side of the face to relieve pain during a cluster bout by injecting Botox up patients' noses through the membrane at the back of the sinuses, to reach the nerve complex.

Other research has suggested that small doses of LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in 'magic mushrooms') can banish cluster headaches for months or even years. The reasons have yet to be explained.

In the less exotic and entirely legal world of the NHS, the first hurdle is getting a diagnosis. According to OUCH, this used to take 25 years on average. Now it's down to six years. One problem is that often it takes a neurologist to identify the symptoms properly. It is common for GPs to mistake cluster headache for other conditions - for instance, trigeminal neuralgia, which causes extreme facial pain.

I was lucky. After an MRI scan had ruled out a brain tumour in 2001, I stumbled on my symptoms in a book about headaches and told my GP, who agreed.

At first I made do with paracetamol, aspirin and ibuprofen - handfuls of them - but to no avail. I moved on to more powerful opiate painkillers, including liquid morphine, but even that wasn't fully effective.

The standard remedies for cluster headaches are the migraine medication sumatriptan (to abort attacks) and blood pressure drug verapamil (to prevent them) and I tried both over the seven years after my diagnosis.

For me, suma-triptan tablets proved ineffective, though the nasal sprays worked better. Verapamil, which you take at the first sign of symptoms and is the first-choice treatment, might have proved a boon, but then I had a heart attack, which meant I had to stop taking it.

In fact, my GP ruled out both drugs - sumatriptan because it narrows blood vessels, raising the risk of a blocked artery, and verapamil because it affects the heart muscle.

I started using oxygen canisters in 2007. Available on prescription from the GP, oxygen remains my chief general weapon against the pain. I strap on a special mask and inhale deeply and repeatedly for as long as an attack lasts. It doesn't take long to drain a large canister.

It's not clear exactly how it works, though oxygen has been shown to lessen sensitivity in facial nerves and it helps in 75 per cent of cases.

Yet according to Professor Goadsby, only one cluster headache sufferer in ten is prescribed it, as neither they nor their doctors are aware it's an option.

Five years ago, I was referred to leading specialist Dr Manjit Matharu, at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, in London. He has given me regular injections with steroids and painkillers in the back of my neck - these act on the greater occipital nerve, which runs from the spine to the back of the head. There are nerve pathways between the occipital and trigeminal nerves.

These injections don't always work for cluster headaches, but in my case they seemed to help.

The first ended my bout after a week, but the effectiveness of subsequent injections has been less clear - it may be that the bout would have ended when it did anyway.

At the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Dr Sarah Miller and others are conducting a trial of R-verapamil, a version of the drug that doesn't affect the heart muscle. If it works and is approved, I'll be first in line.

Meanwhile, I am taking the clinically unproven preventative melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the body clock. Does it help with cluster headaches? Well, this year's bout has ended, though it lasted even longer than usual.

I suspect that, despite being in expert hands, I have plenty more pain in store. Not to mention humiliating trips to the supermarket.
