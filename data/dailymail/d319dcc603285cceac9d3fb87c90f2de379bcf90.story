Almost 25 years ago, McDonald's arrived in the Soviet Union and delighted Russians with their first taste of American fast-food culture - but now the company is the subject of a lawsuit that that could ban it from selling some of its signature products.

The company is being taken to court by the Russian consumer protection agency for selling foods that contain more fats and carbohydrates than are allowed by national regulations.

The lawsuit cannot come at a more difficult time as relations between the United States and Russia worsen as a result of the Ukraine crisis.

Tensions: Russia's consumer protection agency has filed a lawsuit in a Moscow court seeking to ban some of McDonald's Corp's burgers along with its milk shakes and ice cream

Propaganda: Russian food regulators say the company is deceiving consumers about the energy value of its Cheeseburger Royales, Filet-o-Fish, Cheeseburgers and Chicken Burgers and about nutritional value of its milkshakes and ice creams

The U.S. has imposed sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine for allegedly supporting separatist rebels who are fighting in eastern Ukraine.

Although there's no demonstrable connection between the McDonald's suit and the tensions, the consumer protection agency, Rospotrebnadzor, has a history of actions that appear to dovetail Russia's political agenda.

As tensions between Russia and Georgia escalated before their 2008 war, Russia banned the import of Georgian wine and mineral water — two of its major export products — for failing to meet sanitary norms.

Last year, as tensions heated up over Ukraine's desire to sign a trade pact with the European Union, Russia banned imports of chocolates made by the company of Petro Poroshenko, a tycoon who supported the EU deal and is now Ukraine's president.

Rospotrebnadzor said on its website that it brought the case after inspections of two of the company's restaurants in Novgorod.

According to the statement, some food was found with microbial contamination and several items had caloric values two to three times higher than allowed by national regulations.

Fast food: McDonald's said in a statement it had not received any complaint from the agency and had no information about the lawsuit. It said its food was produced according to methods approved by Russian authorities

Products that were mentioned for incorrect nutritional information were cheeseburgers, Royal Cheeseburgers — the local equivalent of the Quarter Pounder — fish sandwiches and several milkshake varieties.

The suits asks that sale of McDonald's products that do not meet the regulations be declared illegal, but it was not clear what penalty the company could face.

The two restaurants in Novgorod were to be fined 70,000 rubles ($2,100).

McDonald's prompted the ire of Russian nationalists earlier this year after it closed its outlets in Crimea.

The animosity is a far cry from the fascination that Muscovites had for McDonald's when it opened its first outlet in the Soviet Union in 1990; customers waited in hours-long lines to experience the efficient service and reliable availability of items — rare novelties in the Soviet era.

After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, other American and European chains staked out their own territory.

Russian malls now have food courts virtually identical to America's, except that Cinnabon, Sbarro and other familiar names are written in Cyrillic.
