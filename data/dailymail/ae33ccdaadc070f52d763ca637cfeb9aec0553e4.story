Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci completed a career Grand Slam on Saturday, battering Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic to win the ladies’ doubles.

The Wimbledon crown was the only major title to have alluded the Italians but they rattled through the final in less than 56 minutes, breaking serve in the first game and easing to a 6-1, 6-3 win.

It was the second seeds’ fifth Grand Slam win as a pairing and the easiest final and they breezed through without one unforced error. They had never previously gone past the quarter-finals at the All England Club.

Babos and Mladenovic, the 14th seeds, had knocked out the top seeds Su-Wei Hsieh and Shuai Peng in the third round but they were badly affected by nerves and Vinci ultimately served out to become the first pair to land all four majors since Venus and Serena Williams in 2001.

Errani said: ‘It’s unbelievable. Not many people have done the Grand Slam. We are really a team all day, with our families, our coaches. Not only for doubles but also when we are in the singles. We know how to help each other.’
