Burnley have warned Liverpool off Danny Ings and said they would be breaking Premier League rules by trying to set up a loan deal.

Liverpool wanted to explore the prospect of signing the England Under 21 striker and allowing him to stay at Turf Moor until the end of the season.

Such a move, however, would be in breach of Premier League guidelines, as clubs are only allowed to loan out new signings to teams in the Championship or abroad, as Liverpool did with striker Divock Origi and Lille.

Ings is out of contract this summer and is not close to signing a new deal.

Burnley chief executive Lee Hoos took the unusual step of issuing a statement on Friday in an attempt to end speculation about the 22-year-old’s future.

‘This type of move would violate Premier League rule V7 regarding transfers, so simply cannot happen,’ said Hoos.

‘This is the last time we will be making any comment regarding the player’s future.’

If Ings, who is also attracting interest from Real Sociedad and Tottenham, leaves in June, Burnley will be entitled to a small amount of compensation. 

Sportsmail understands the player is receptive to a move abroad and would welcome approaches from the Bundesliga in Germany.   

Under FIFA rules regarding young players, Burnley would be entitled to compensation in that instance, but it is understood Sociedad would only be liable to pay £300,000 - leaving them plenty of room to offer a huge salary - while fellow English clubs could end up paying a fee 10 times that amount.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers does not expect many, if any departures, from his first-team squad before Monday but he will allow 17-year-old Sheyi Ojo to go out on loan.

Steven Gerrard could make his 700th appearance for Liverpool and is third on the club’s all-time list:

After Jordon Ibe's success at Derby in the first half of the season, Ojo, who has yet to make his senior debut but was on the bench for recent matches against Burnley and Leicester, is set for a temporary move to Sky Bet Championship strugglers Wigan.

Rodgers, meanwhile, believes Steven Gerrard may be the last entrant into an exclusive group.

If the long-serving captain, who played all 120 minutes of Liverpool’s Capital One Cup semi-final against Chelsea on Tuesday, is involved in Saturday’s game with West Ham at Anfield, it will be his 700th appearance for the club. Only Ian Callaghan and Jamie Carragher have reached that figure.

Rodgers said: ‘It’s incredible. It will take some achievement by any player to do that again.’
