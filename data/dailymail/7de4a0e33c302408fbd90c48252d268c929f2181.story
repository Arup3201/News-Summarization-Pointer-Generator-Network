Police in St Louis have made a third arrest in connection to Sunday's deadly hammer attack on a Bosnian immigrant, charging a 17-year-old as an adult in the slaying.

The arrests of the youths - among them two black teens and one Hispanic - in the death of 32-year-old Zemir Begic came as city officials struggled to tamp down speculations that the killing of the Bosnian man may have been motivated by race or somehow related to the ongoing unrest in Ferguson.

'There is no evidence that this was a crime occasioned by the race or ethnicity of the victim,' St Louis Mayor Francis Slay said in a statement Monday.

Killing: Police said that Zemir Begic was driving in Bevo Mill early Sunday morning when a group of juveniles surrounded his car and began banging on it, beating him when he stepped out

'Speculation that this attack had anything to do with the Ferguson protests is absolutely unfounded.

'I don’t know what happened to them or to their families to lead these young people to commit such a horrific crime. It’s disturbing. We do not know their past. Their futures, though, will be as grim as the judicial system can make it,' the mayor said in the statement cited by the St Louis Post-Dispatch. 

Mayor Slay reiterated his position on the matter in a tweet sent out Monday afternoon, calling the killing an act of 'random and senseless violence.'  

Zemir Begic, 32, a South City resident of Bosnian descent, was driving home with his newlywed wife at around 1.15am when police say a group of teenagers approached his car and began vandalizing it.

Begic emerged from his vehicle to try and stop them, at which point the teenagers allegedly attacked him with hammers, striking him in the head, face and abdomen.

The motorist was taken to an area hospital, where he died from his injuries a short time later. His wife escaped unharmed after her husband reportedly shielded her from the attackers with his body.

Suspect Robert Mitchell, 17, turned himself in Sunday night after two of his alleged accomplices, ages 15 and 16, were arrested by police, reported St Louis Post-Dispatch. 

The 17-year-old is being charged as an adult with first-degree murder and armed criminal action.

Detectives say they know the identity of the fourth suspect in the killing, but as of Monday evening that person has not been taken into custody.

A motive in the killing has not been released, but Police Chief Sam Dotson said there's no indication Begic was targeted by the hammer-wielding youths because he was Bosnian.

Police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said they believe Begic was simply in the wrong place, at the wrong time. 

Zemir Begic  was heading home from a bar at 1.15am in St Louis when a group of teenagers surrounded his car and began banging on it. 

His wife of six months Arijana Mujkanovic (pictured) said: 'The last thing he did before he actually died was pull me out of the way and put himself in front of me, basically giving up his life for me'

The police have said they do not think the attack was racially motivated - but the crowd on Sunday disagreed

Anger: Members of the Bosnian community marched in anger at the killing on Sunday. Police have reassured residents the attack wasn't a hate crime but it has done little to appease outrage

The attack was not related to Ferguson protests taking place in the city, police say

The 32-year-old stepped out of the vehicle, only to be yelled at and set upon with hammers, striking him in the head, abdomen and face and leaving him fatally injured. 

He was unconscious when police arrived  - he was taken to St Louis University Hospital, where he later died.

His wife of six months, Arijana Mujkanovic, said: 'The last thing he did before he actually died was pull me out of the way and put himself in front of me, basically giving up his life for me.' 

'That is out of anger because he doesn't deserve this and most of these people don't even know him,' she told KSDK.

Suad Nuranjkovic, 49, said Begic was driving and he was in the passenger seat when a group of at least five teens started banging on the car. 

'I was afraid that if one of them had a gun, they were going to shoot me, so I didn't know what to do,' Nuranjkovic said. 

He fled to a parking lot across the street. 

'The picture is in my head, what I saw,' he said.

'I don't know why this is happening to Bosnians. We could go around and shoot people, too, but we just want peace.'

Two males, ages 15 and 16, were taken into custody, followed by 17-year-old Robert Mitchell, who surrendered to homicide detectives overnight. A fourth suspect remains at large. 

The suspects are described as being a group of Hispanic and black males by the St Louis Post-Dispatch. 

The attack was not related to Ferguson protests taking place in the city, police say.  

On Sunday evening, members of the Bosnian community protested  Bejic's death in Bevo Hill, and raised the possibility that Begic, who came to the US  in 1996, had been killed because of he was Bosnian.

The protesters, who numbered about 50, said another member of their community was murdered in 2013, when an armed robber killed Haris Gogic, 19, in his family's store.

'There is no indication that the gentleman last night was targeted because he was Bosnian,' Police Chief Sam Dotson told the crowd.

'There's no indication that they knew each other.' 

Seldin Dzananoic, 24, said he was accosted by a group of teens with hammers on the same street about an hour before Begic was attacked, but was able to fight them off with only minor injuries.

'I'm just lucky,' he said. 'God is on my side.'

Dotson said foot patrols would be stepped up in the area as well. 

According to his Facebook profile, Begic worked for a removals company. 

A GoFundMe page that had raised just shy of $5,000 will help cover the costs of Begic's funeral, which is set to be held in Iowa, Begic's sister Denisa said.

The family emigrated from Bosnia to the United States in 1996 and settled in Utica, New York, before moving to Waterloo, Iowa, said Begic's sister from her home in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

'He loved America,' she said. 

'We come from Bosnia because we were getting killed and our homes and families were getting destroyed. Never in my life did I think he would get murdered.'

Begic had lived in Arizona as well before moving to St Louis, and had married his wife only months before his murder.

With a population estimated to be around 70,000, St Louis has the largest community of Bosnians outside of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
