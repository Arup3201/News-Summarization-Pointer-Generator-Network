Scientists are developing a groundbreaking handheld testing kit to diagnose cancer, HIV and a host of other diseases within minutes.

Experts say their pioneering new method of testing patient samples on a small chip plugged into an iPhone will slash costs and waiting times.

Researchers at the University of Southampton, Hants, liken the technology to the tricorder used to remotely scan patients in cult classic film Star Trek.

Testers would stand at a patient's bedside, take smaller samples than currently used, and test them for a variety of killer diseases with ease.

The first prototypes should be available for initial testing next year under the £1million project.

Doctor Themis Prodromakis, from the University's Electronic and Computer Sciences department, said the possibilities were 'exciting'.

The test works by using electrical components as chemical sensors to detect reactions between proteins and antibodies, Dr Prodromakis said.

After a few minutes, the device would give a 'Yes' or 'No' reading for the relevant virus.

Dr Prodromakis said: ‘The current system, which has been in use for 30 years or so, uses antibodies that react with the viruses.

‘The equipment is quite bulky and requires a lot of samples from the patient, which causes them a lot of discomfort.

‘It also needs someone to work overnight in a lab to pipette the material into wells and observe any changes.

‘The new method would detect what 
you're looking for technically, by using PCBs used in consumer 
electronics and computers to automate the process.

‘You'd
 plug one of these chips into a device like an iPhone, put the samples 
in and have a diagnosis within a few minutes, rather than days or weeks.

‘It's
 an incredibly versatile technique that can be used to test many 
different things, such as HIV, tuberculosis or various cancers, in any 
environment.

‘This is a 
very exciting development as it's cheap and mobile and could be used to 
diagnose people in third world countries within minutes.’

Chips would cost £50 compared to around £500 under the conventional system, which also monitors proteins, Dr Prodromakis said.

Dr Prodromakis has teamed up with Newbury Electronics, a leading manufacturer of PCBs in the UK, on the three year project.

Clinical trials will be carried out at the Department of Infection and Immunity at Imperial College Healthcare NHS.

The new technology would need less than one microlitre of blood to be taken from the patient.

In the fictional Star Trek universe, a tricorder is a multifunction hand-held device used for sensor scanning, data analysis and recording data.

Three primary variants of the tricorder are issued in Star Trek's Starfleet.

The standard tricorder is a general-purpose device used primarily to scout unfamiliar areas, make detailed examination of living things, and record and review technical data.

The medical tricorder is used by doctors to help diagnose diseases and collect bodily information about a patient; the key difference between this and a standard tricorder is a detachable hand-held high-resolution scanner stored in a compartment of the tricorder when not in use.

The engineering tricorder is fine-tuned for starship engineering purposes. There are also many other lesser-used varieties of special-use tricorders.

The word 'tricorder' is a combination of 'tri-' and 'recorder', referring to its three device input keys, which by default cover GEO (geological), MET (meteorological), and BIO (biological) functions.
