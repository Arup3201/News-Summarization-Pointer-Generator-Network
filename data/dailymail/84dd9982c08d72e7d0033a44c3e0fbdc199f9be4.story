Mark Cavendish was quick to apply a sense of perspective after withdrawing from the Tour de France with the injury he suffered in a dramatic crash at the finish of the opening stage.

‘I’ve got friends who have come back from Afghanistan with the armed forces,’ he said. ‘You saw my Help for Heroes helmet yesterday.

'My friend Josh is a double amputee and missing his right arm. He sent me a message joking saying "I’ve got a spare arm for you".

Down and out: Mark Cavendish has had to pull out of the Tour de France after injuring his shoulder

‘I’ve also got friends like Taylor Phinney, who is out for the rest of the season. I’m in the left-handed club with him for a bit now but things could be worse. And it was my fault.’

The Isle of Man rider was indeed at fault after trying to squeeze through a gap that just wasn’t there as the riders sprinted towards the finish in Harrogate on Saturday.

He bored into Australian Simon Gerrans with his head in a desperate bid to create some space, succeeding only in bringing both of them down as German Marcel Kittel sped away for the stage win.

After an MRI scan at a nearby hospital it emerged that Cavendish had suffered ‘ligament ruptures with an AC-joint dislocation’ in his right shoulder.

Yesterday morning’s news that he had boarded the Omega Pharma-Quickstep team bus to York racecourse for the start offered a glimmer of hope.

But the team then confirmed the fears of cycling fans hoping to see Cavendish sprint to glory on The Mall at the end of today’s third stage after failure to do so at the London Olympics in 2012.

Had he beaten Kittel along Harrogate’s Parliament Street, it would have been his 26th stage win and his first opportunity to wear the yellow jersey. As it is, he is out of the race.

After emerging from the team bus with his arm in a sling Cavendish said: ‘I knew immediately because normally in crashes I bounce back straight away. My shoulder was sticking out the way it shouldn’t.

‘This was the first time in my career that I knew something was up but I wanted to finish, and I was able to do that, but I was in pain. I had some optimism that the swelling would go down overnight but it’s not possible to start today.

‘I’m absolutely devastated. Firstly, the Tour is in the UK for another two days and secondly we have an incredible team.’ 

Cavendish had accepted responsibility for the crash in a statement on Saturday night.

But
 he added: ‘I spoke to Simon Gerrans at the finish and then I called him
 at his hotel last night too. We both went for Peter Sagan’s wheel but I
 wanted that gap so bad but it wasn’t there.

‘I hope Simon is OK and today is a stage for him. He’s a good guy and I wish him well for the rest of the Tour. I’m sorry.

‘I would have loved to have been here for three weeks as we have a really strong team here but the crash was my fault.’

It
 is the first time since 2008 —when he left prematurely to prepare for 
the Beijing Olympics —that Cavendish will not complete the Tour.

The 2011 points classification winner and world champion won in Paris for four consecutive years from 2009 to 2012.

His
 withdrawal means there are just three Britons left in the 
race:defending champion Chris Froome, his Team Sky team-mate Geraint 
Thomas and Simon Yates from Orica-GreenEdge.

Cavendish will travel to London today for further tests on his injured shoulder but is unlikely to watch the race.

Only
 after it has been established if he will require surgery will a 
decision be made on whether he rides at the Commonwealth Games in 
Glasgow.
