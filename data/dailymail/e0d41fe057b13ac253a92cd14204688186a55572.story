Dressed in a Muslim veil and surrounded from all angles by armed officers, this was the astonishing scene yesterday as a tranquil seaside resort was plunged into a full-scale terror alert.

Scores of officers carrying sub-machine guns and wearing full protective uniform descended on Saltburn-by-the-Sea, near Middlesbrough, at 11am after reports that a woman had a bomb in her bag.

During a dramatic stand-off with police negotiators, the woman – said to be local to the area – was ordered to place the rucksack on the ground.

Armed Police surrounded the woman in Saltburn, Teesside, and took aim. Her bag was behind her

In the tense moments that followed, a
police helicopter hovered overhead as she was then told to drop to her 
knees while keeping her hands up. As negotiators continued to talk to 
her, she was instructed to get to her feet and walk away from the 
rucksack.

As officers trained their weapons on 
her, they watched every step towards the seafront before ordering her to
sit on a nearby bench.

Once there she placed her hands on her head.

The terrifying stand-off went on into
the evening as Army bomb disposal experts headed to the scene from 
nearby Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, to carry out a controlled 
explosion on the rucksack.

Witnesses said the woman, who was 
white and wearing a dress with a veil, had earlier been to a hardware 
store in the town and purchased items.

A resident, who did not want to be 
named, said: 'She doesn't say a lot, she's always walking around wearing
a white hijab. My friend tried to say hello to her once, she just 
snapped at him.

The woman was ordered to walk forward, away from the bag as armed police kept their guns trained on her

The bag was left in the street with concerned officers treating it as a suspect package

Specialist officers took cover in case the package contained a bomb

'We heard she went to M and M DIY Home Improvement hardware store, trying to buy things to make a bomb, apparently.'

Sales assistants at the store would 
not confirm that the woman had been to the shop but a shopkeeper nearby 
said she had been in yesterday morning. Sign-fitter Will Murray was 
working in the arcade in the town's pier when the stand-off began.

As members of the public were 
evacuated from the area, he and his colleagues were trapped inside and 
saw armed police and bomb   experts descend on the scene.

The woman, pictured here with her hands on her head, was found by police sitting on a seafront bench

Police quickly put up a cordon around the scene as police and fire fighters gathered to deal with the incident

The 31-year-old from Gateshead, Tyne 
and Wear, said: 'Police coaxed her out of a small shelter near to the 
pier at around noon and got her to kneel on the floor. I don't think 
they realised we were in here until it was too late to get us out.'

As armed police moved in, another witness described the dramatic scenes.

She said: 'She is sitting on the bench with her hands on her head. An armed policeman is pointing a gun at her.

Officers swamped the small seafront town of Saltburn in Teesside after being alerted at 11am

'There are about four officers that I can see.'

It is not known what the woman's 
intentions were and whether her rucksack contained any explosive 
materials. Nor is it known whether she is an extremist.

Last night, a spokesman for Cleveland
Police said: 'A number of officers were at the scene and a cordon was 
put in place to prevent public access to an area close to the sands and 
to ensure public safety.

'Armed officers and trained negotiators were at the scene as well as other emergency services.'

The spokesman said some people had been evacuated from nearby premises.

'The priority of the police is to bring about a safe conclusion to the incident and inquiries are on-going,' she added.

The incident ended officially at 7.20pm, police said. A 40-year-old woman was detained under the Mental Health Act.

Superintendent Kieron Irvine said: 'This was a fairly lengthy incident with a successful outcome.'
