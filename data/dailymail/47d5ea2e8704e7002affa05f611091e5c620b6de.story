Police investigating the apparent car attack at Beijing's Forbidden City searched Tuesday for information on two ethnic Uighur minority suspects, a hotel employee said, a day after the vehicle plowed through a crowd and crashed, killing five people and injuring 38.

Police released no public information about a possible motive for the incident at one of China's most politically sensitive and heavily guarded public spaces, and it was not immediately clear if the two suspects were among the three people killed inside the vehicle.

Two bystanders, including a Filipino woman, also were killed when the sport utility vehicle veered inside of a barrier separating a crowded sidewalk from a busy avenue and then drove toward Tiananmen Gate, which stands opposite the sprawling Tiananmen Square.

Any incident in the area is sensitive 
because the square was the focus of a 1989 pro-democracy movement that 
was violently suppressed by the military.

The
 38 injured were among the crowds in front of the gate, where a large 
portrait of Mao Zedong hangs near the southern entrance to the former 
imperial palace. Three other Filipinos and a Japanese man were among the
 injured, police said, but there were no immediate details on their 
conditions.

Zhao Fuzhou, a 
security official at Beijing's Xinjiang Dasha hotel, said police had 
circulated a notice searching for information about two suspects with 
Uighur names in the aftermath of Monday's deaths. Unconfirmed copies of 
the notice also were widely circulated on the Chinese Internet.

One
 of the men, identified in the notice as Yusupu Wumaierniyazi, was 
listed as living at the address of a town in Xinjiang in which 24 police
 and civilians and 13 militants were killed in an attack on June 26.

The square normally is under heavy security given its proximity to the Zhongnanhai compound of the central leadership

The car veered off the road at the north entrance of the square before ploughing into pedestrians

Radicals
 among the Muslim Turkic Uighurs have been fighting a low-intensity 
insurgency against Chinese rule for years. This summer saw an unusually 
large number of violent incidents and Chinese security forces say they 
have been guarding against attacks outside of Xinjiang.

Uighurs
 are culturally, religiously and linguistically distinct from China's 
ethnic Han majority and many have chafed under heavy-handed Communist 
Party rule.

Beijing police said on their microblog that they were taking ‘effective measures to ensure the capital's safety and stability.’

A
 police statement said the vehicle had burst into flames after crashing 
at about noon Monday into a guardrail for one of the ancient stone 
bridges leading to the gate. The adjacent Chang'an Avenue was closed as 
police and rescue services converged, but police said traffic was 
restored just over an hour later.

The square was the site of 1989 student-led protests which led to mass violence at the hands of military forces

The
 incident had every appearance of being deliberate, since the driver 
apparently jumped a curb and traveled about 400 meters (yards) to the 
spot where the car was said to have caught fire. Along the way, it 
avoided trees, street lights and at least one security checkpoint.

Photos
 of the scene that briefly circulated on the Internet showed a vehicle 
emitting thick smoke at the gate. Injured people, including a young 
girl, lay on the ground, many of them bleeding heavily.

Philippine
 Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman Raul Hernandez said their 
information indicated that the woman who died and the injured Filipinos -
 two women and a man - were tourists. ‘Our embassy is working to gather 
more details about this incident and to extend the necessary and 
appropriate assistance to the victims,’ he said in a statement.

Police said the other tourist killed was a Chinese man from the southern province of Guangdong.

Attendants
 and nearby concession stand vendors who were asked about the incident 
all said they were not clear on what happened. Such employees are 
generally understood to be part-time police informants.

Just
 west of the square lies the Great Hall of the People, the seat of 
China's parliament, while many of China's top leaders live and work just
 a few hundred meters (yards) away in the tightly guarded Zhongnanhai 
compound.
