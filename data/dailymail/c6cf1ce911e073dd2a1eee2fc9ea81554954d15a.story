Fawning letters from Prince Charles and Tony Blair to Colonel Gaddafi have been discovered at one of the despot’s palaces.

Addressing the dictator as ‘Your Excellency’, the heir to the throne called for greater ties between Libya and the UK.

It is the latest embarrassing link to emerge between the British Establishment  and Gaddafi’s regime, following revelations that Prince Andrew was also used as a go-between.

Prince Charles’s letter is dated June 7, 2007, and was discovered in a palace used by Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi’s London-educated playboy son.

The prince praised the dictator for his work with Christians, Aids victims and the British Council, writing: ‘I just wanted to write to Your Excellency to say how heartened I am by the breadth of these developments.’

Charles’s letter was sent days after Tony Blair had visited Libya in his final weeks as Prime Minister to seek oil and defence deals for British companies.

The prince went on to say he had been briefed on Mr Blair’s trip and ‘the positive way in which relations between Libya and the United Kingdom are developing’.

Another letter to Gaddafi was sent by Mr Blair a month later, stressing the determination of his government to pursue deals with his regime.

Both letters preceded an agreement to provide an air defence system which would have been designed to thwart the type of attacks with which Nato helped to unseat Gaddafi.

Last month, Prince Andrew’s role was revealed in papers discovered at the British ambassador’s residence in Tripoli.

The Duke of York was offered up to meet Gaddafi as the Labour government desperately tried to appease the unpredictable dictator.

Royal sources insisted that Charles’s letter was nothing to do with defence contracts, and was part of an international campaign to free six Bulgarian nurses imprisoned in 1998 after being falsely accused of infecting Libyan children with HIV.

‘The charges were clearly trumped up and governments across the EU were involved in the campaign for their release,’ a royal source told the Daily Mail.

‘This was not something that the prince chose to do off his own back. It was a piece of international diplomacy at the request of the Government.’

A spokesman for Mr Blair said: ‘Gaddafi was received in several European capitals, including Brussels, Rome and Paris.

‘There was, therefore, at that time no reason whatsoever for not continuing to engage with him, especially since Mr Blair in office had been responsible for getting Gaddafi to give up his chemical and nuclear weapons programme and renounce terrorism.’
