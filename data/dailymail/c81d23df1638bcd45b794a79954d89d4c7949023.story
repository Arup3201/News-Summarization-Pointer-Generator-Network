Liverpool have returned to Europe's elite competition for the first time in five years and their Champions League comeback means the youth team can get involved in the fun too.

If you've not come across it by now, the UEFA Youth League is an Under 19 competition that runs parallel to the main show.

And Liverpool's maiden appearance in the tournament was a big success as their academy side defeated Ludogorets Razgrad 4-0 on Tuesday afternoon.

The star of the show at Langtree Park in St Helens was forward Jerome Sinclair, who notched two goals in the comprehensive win.

But who is the hotshot tipped for a big future at Anfield? Sportsmail has everything you need to know.

Jerome Sinclair scored twice as Liverpool's Under 19s beat Ludogorets Razgrad in the UEFA Youth League

Name: Jerome Sinclair

Age: 17

Club: Liverpool

Position: Striker

I'm going to need more than that...

In contrast to the senior side, who needed a stoppage time penalty to overcome Ludogorets at Anfield later in the day, Liverpool's youngsters were far too powerful for their Bulgarian opponents.

They ran the show from first whistle to last in the St Helens sunshine and the chances and goals flowed at frequent intervals.

If they had sustained the free-flowing football of the first-half, in which they scored three times, this could have been a victory for the record books.

But in the end, four goals was more than sufficient, with Jerome Sinclair very happy with his match-defining double.

His first, on the half-hour mark, was an accomplished finish after left-back Sam Hart had split the Ludogorets back line with a surging run from deep.

His second, three minutes from time, was a straightforward piece of opportunism, pouncing to score on the rebound after Harry Wilson's free-kick had rebounded off the post.

These were just two examples of the many types of goal Sinclair is capable of and a small glimpse into the buzz around a 17-year-old coaches at Anfield believe can become the next Raheem Sterling.

Sinclair already holds the distinction of being the youngest player to turn out for Liverpool, making his senior debut with a nine-minute cameo in a League Cup tie at West Brom in september 2012.

He was a tender 16 years and six days old.

Why all the fuss?

Well, although that remains Sinclair's one and only senior outing, he has been making great strides at youth team and Under 21 level.

Born in Birmingham in September 1996, Sinclair was a member of the West Brom academy between the ages of 10 and 14 before being spotted by Liverpool.

He spent the 2011-2012 campaign mainly with the Under 16 side but made a handful of appearances for the Under 18 team towards the end.

His coach Mike Marsh was impressed by his talent and a 15-year-old Sinclair was even invited to rub shoulders with the likes of Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard at Melwood, something he later described as a 'great learning curve.'

It wasn't long before Sinclair found his scoring boots, with a prolific pre-season in 2012 leading to a call up into the squad Rodolfo Borrell was about to lead into the NextGen Series.

Sinclair impressed in the first group match away to Inter Milan, winning a penalty that Krisztian Adorjan converted and going close himself on a number of occasions.

Liverpool were narrowly beaten 3-2 in that game but went on to advance from the group, Sinclair scoring his first goal in continental competition in a 4-1 win over Rosenborg.

These appearances came either side of that first team run-out at The Hawthorns, a moment Sinclair described as a 'dream come true' in a later interview.

Sinclair has since represented the club's Under 18 team and also made three appearances for the Under 21s at the tail end of last season.

His double against Ludogorets will only enhance his reputation, with group matches against Real Madrid and Basle to come.

What about international recognition?

Sinclair has represented England at Under 16 and Under 17 level. His debut came in the Victory Shield in October 2011, when Wales were beaten 4-0.

His first goals for the Three Lions came at the 2012 Montaigu Tournament in France, helping to secure wins against the hosts and also Morocco.

What are his strengths?

As shown in the Youth League, Sinclair is already a good finisher and has a knack of getting into the right place at the right time to gobble up loose balls.

He seems strong on both feet when in and around the penalty area and has good placement.

At 5ft 8in, Sinclair won't win a great deal in their air but he has tricky feet and good acceleration too, so he fits in with the fluid passing game the Liverpool academy try to foster.

What happens next?

Sinclair can really make a name for himself in the Youth League, especially if he performs in the matches against real Madrid, which will enjoy a raised profile.

He will continue to get opportunities for the Under 21 team and has plenty of time on his side to mature and develop in this age bracket.

Though unlikely to break into the first team just yet, he is well on the way to realising his abundant potential.
