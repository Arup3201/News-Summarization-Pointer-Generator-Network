Victimised: Sadia Raza, 49, was harassed by her boss Graham Holland at a Christianity retreat centre

A former housekeeper from Asia has won £43,000 compensation after being asked 'is that how they run hotels in Pakistan?' as she felt harassed by her boss at a Christian retreat centre.

The comment to Sadia Raza, 49, was made after general manager Graham Holland was unimpressed by the way she had made up a room.

The single mother was chided and abused in front of colleagues for no reason at the Whirlow Grange Christianity Centre in Sheffield, a tribunal heard.

On another occasion, Mr Holland picked up a cheesecake dessert in the staff canteen and said: 'If I drop this plate Sadia will lick it up off the floor.'

Mr Holland, who is married with three children and a keen motorcyclist, also asked the Pakistan-born worker while in the kitchen: 'Do you fancy a ride?'

Not realising this was a smutty double entendre, Mrs Raza replied: 'Oh yes, whereabouts?' Mr Holland then said: 'How would you like something red hot and throbbing through your legs.'

Mr Holland also told Mrs Raza she should have a relationship with an Indian-born security guard at the centre saying: 'He wants to stay his visa has expired.'

Once he reduced her to tears when he told her to 'f*** off' as she attempted to wipe clean spilled tea on a lunch table in front of him.

And on another occasion he told a tradesman: 'Oh here she is. This is who gives free hugs to 
people.'

The tribunal ruled that Mrs Raza had been 'upset and humiliated' by Mr Holland's behaviour.

Mrs Raza told the tribunal Mr Holland was 'aggressive and insulting' towards her as if he was 'speaking to an errant ten-year-old child.'

She won her claim for unfair dismissal and victimisation and partly succeeded in a harassment claim following a three-day hearing in Sheffield. However, her claim of race and sex discrimination were rejected.

Mr Holland and Mrs Raza's employers had denied all the allegations.

The incidents all happened while she was working part-time for 16 hours a week at the residential conference and spirituality centre in Sheffield where the Archbishops of York and Canterbury have stayed in the past.

After she got a second job as a care assistant at a Leonard Cheshire home to boost her income she was sacked after just a fortnight there because of a poor reference from Whirlow Grange management.

She then took out employment tribunal proceedings against Whirlow in February 2012.

Abuse: Mrs Raza, 49, was victimised and unfairly dismissed from Whirlow Grange, in Sheffield, the tribunal ruled

She was hauled before a disciplinary meeting and two months later sacked for gross misconduct - over allegations that she sexually harassed four men at the centre.

Management claimed she pinched the bottoms of the male employees, cuddled and flirted with them, even suggested to one man that they go up to his flat.

But none of these witnesses were produced at the Sheffield tribunal and Employment Judge Philip Rostant said 'the tribunal draws an inference that the allegations are not true in their substance or at any rate amount to gross exaggerations of the experience of these men with the claimant.'

Whirlow Grange and Mr Holland, who lived in Chesterfield, claimed Mrs Raza 'conducted a number of acts of 
gross misconduct' involving sexually harassing the head chef and bar 
supervisor and was sacked after a 'reasonable' internal investigation.

The tribunal ruled several other claims made by Mrs Raza were 'outlandish' and that she could be 'irritating' towards Mr Holland on occasions.

But Mr Rostant said she had suffered 'appallingly unfair treatment' during the disciplinary procedure and the panel accepted she was 'upset and humiliated' by Mr Holland's behaviour.

After winning compensation the single mother who is divorced and has a 17-year-old son said: 'Mr Holland told other staff he was a born Christian but his behaviour towards me was hardly Christian-like.'

Mrs Raza, from Sheffield, a British Asian who came to the United Kingdom 18 years ago, had worked in a Citizen's Advice Bureau, for a letting agent and as a cleaner before taking the job at Whirlow Grange in November, 2009.

She earned just £93 a week in her job which involved cleaning, helping in the kitchen and general household duties.

Since she was sacked she has lived on £71 a week Job Seekers Allowance and has suffered ill health which requires her to see a psychiatrist once a month.

She claims her former 'sunny disposition' was wrecked after her dismissal and blames Mr Holland, who left Whirlow Grange in September last year, for her plight.

Her doctor says she is suffering from 'enormous stress' and is currently unfit for work. She is practically penniless and still has a mortgage and bills to pay and represented herself at the tribunal after running up legal bills of £2,500.

She said: 'I was accused of flirting with everybody from the chef to the gardener. It was all rubbish just to fabricate a claim of sexual harassment against me.

'In the beginning I thought Graham Holland was a good person. Then he started bullying me to the point where I used to cry at work. He barked at me like a bulldog and swore at me for no reason.

'He treated me like a piece of dog dirt. He didn't speak to any other member of staff like that. He couldn't stand me for some reason and made my life hell.'

Whirlow Grange and Mr Holland jointly have to pay the £43,000 compensation. He is liable to pay £3,000.

A spokesman for Whirlow Grange has not yet responded to a request for comment.
