Olivia Culpo was reported to police because she showed one of her shoes in this pose

Miss Universe Olivia Culpo has found herself at the center of a storm of controversy during a trip to India after she allegedly violated strict product placement rules at the Taj Mahal on Sunday.

The notoriously inflexible Archaeological Survery of India (ASI) has lodged a police complaint against the 21-year-old 2012 Miss Universe and the agency behind her visit.

It comes after she appeared to model a pair of high-heeled shoes while photographers shot her with the iconic monument to love in the background.

The incident took place at the marble bench popularly known as the Diana Seat, named after the now famous picture taken of a forlorn looking Princess Diana on a trip to the Taj in 1992 - which was seen to highlight the sad state of her marriage to Prince Charles.

Culpo, who is seeing Nick Jonas of 
the Jonas brothers, was in India for 10 days to promote charitable 
issues such as women empowerment and AIDS awareness across the country.

According
 to the Supreme Court of India, any branding or publicity in or around 
the Taj Mahal is prohibited under law and the ASI's complaint alleges 
Culpo and her handlers fell foul of this.

'Sandals (high heels) of a particular brand were taken out of the bag by someone in the group,' says the ASI according to the Hindustan Times of India.

'Culpo
 donned one of the sandals and held another in her hand, reportedly to 
advertise them while cameramen accompanying her shot the scene with the 
Taj in the background.'

During her one-hour vist to the world
 heritage site on Sunday, Culpo and her entourage seemed to show as much
 interest as any of the millions of tourists who visit the 360-year-old 
white marble mausoleum located in Agra, in the central state of Uttar 
Pradesh.

Built by 
Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal and 
completed in 1653, the Taj Mahal visit was going well until Culpo 
reached the marble plinth at the top of the Central Pond that leads to 
the entrance.

It is alleged that her team produced 
shoes which she started trying on as photographers snapped away and 
there was no objection from police on duty.

Known as India's most recognizable building, the white marble mausoleum was built by Emperor Shah Jahan, in memory of his wife Mumtaz after her deathThe construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was completed in 1653. It took a total of twenty two years to complete the construction of this monumentThe Taj Mahal was Shah Jahan’s imagination of Mumtaz’s home in paradise and 20,000 people worked day and night for twenty two years to complete construction of the Taj MahalA popular myth is that Shah Jahan cut off the hands of all the workers so that such a structure could not be built again

'We have taken note of the incident and are appraising the superintending archaeologist in writing,' said Munazzar Ali, conservation archaeologist (CA) for the ASI office at the Taj.

'Indeed, there are guidelines prohibiting branding and publicity on the Taj premises but facts related to the incident are yet to be verified.'

Olivia, who won Miss Universe Title last year, visited India from September 27th till OCtober 6th as part of her Miss Universe Commitments.

Earlier in her trip, Culpo also visited the notorious Tihar jail in the capital New Delhi.

While visiting the jail took a pledge from the inmates against violence against the women.

During her tour, Culpo was shown around and explained the functioning of the jail factory and the products manufactured by the inmates.

And just before she jetted off to India she celebrated her boyfriend, Nick Jonas' 21st birthday in Las Vegas.
