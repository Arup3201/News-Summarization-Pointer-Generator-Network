Basle will be very welcome visitors to the Santiago Bernabeu. They come fresh from a 3-1 defeat to Zurich Grasshoppers at the weekend, they have a new coach in Paulo Sousa who has not convinced supporters, and they have 36-year-old Walter Samuel holding their defence together. It should be a morale-boosting win for Real Madrid... and how they need it.

The team that followed up winning last season’s competition by signing three of the stars of the World Cup are currently languishing in 13th place in La Liga having lost two of their opening three fixtures.

Carlo Ancelotti has admitted there is an ‘attitude problem’ among his squad while the players believe the difficulties have been created by the sale of two of the team’s most important players - either way it’s a mess.

Real Madrid won the Champions League last season but a crisis is starting to brew in the Spanish capital

Supporters jeered Iker Casillas throughout the defeat to Atletico Madrid at the weekend and whistled the whole team off at the end of the game. Several autograph hunters tried to kick out at Gareth Bale’s car as he drove away from the club’s Valdebebas training ground without stopping for signings and photographs, and some of the club’s supporters even took to draping banners over various bridges on the city’s M30 ring road calling for the resignation of president Florentino Perez.

It is Perez who makes the transfer-market decisions in Madrid and his tried and tested formula of signing the latest boy wonder of world football at whatever cost - financing such outlay through commercial deals and the sale of other players - is nothing new and was in evidence again this summer.

Champions League winning coach Carlo Ancelotti was told Angel di Maria was going and that Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez would be incoming. At first Ancelotti, who after years at Milan under Silvio Berlusconi is a master of keeping a very hands-on president happy, did not fret. Kroos, Luka Modric and Xabi Alonso still made for solid midfield three.

But then the club sanctioned Alonso’s move to Bayern Munich. Again Ancelotti kept his calm and moved on to plan C - using Sami Khedira alongside Modric and Kroos. But Khedira got injured and is out for a month so the Italian coach was on to plan D which, judging from defeats to Real Sociedad and Atletico, is not working too well.

The president would like to see Kroos and Modric as a pair in midfield with Bale, James and Ronaldo behind Karim Benzema in attack but Ancelotti and his coaching staff see that option as offering Real Madrid’s full-backs, attacking by nature, little or no protection. Either Bale and Ronaldo would have to spend half the game tracking back, or the likes of Dani Carvajal, Marcelo and Fabio Coentrao would be left exposed.

One-time Madrid sporting director Arrigo Sacchi says in the first galatico era between 2003 and 2006 he once asked Perez to give him his first XI. Owing to the abundance of attacking players the president had Zinedine Zidane at centre-back and David Beckham at right back. This is what Ancelotti must contend with.

It has been suggested to the coach that he put Bale back in midfield to cover the loss of Di Maria. The logic behind the suggestion - understood to have come from on high - is that as a former full-back Bale would be able to do the defensive work that Di Maria used to do.

Having scored the winning goal in the Spanish Cup final last season - running from the half-way line in the 87th minute - and then the goal that put Real Madrid in front in the Champions League final, not to mention 21 other goals and 20 assists, asking Bale to do more defensive work seems bizarre. But maybe no more bizarre than selling the team’s top assist provider Di Maria rather than pay him 4m euros a year more in wages.

On Monday Ancelotti was saying the right things: he is happy with his squad and wouldn’t swap it for any other in Europe. Win on Tuesday against the Swiss and then beat Deportivo away at the weekend and Elche at home, then talk of crisis will subside.

Any slips however, and with a visit to Villarreal in the league - where Madrid could only draw last season - and a trip to Bulgaria to play Ludogorets on the horizon, the question marks will soon go from centring on whether the coach is happy with his squad to whether his president is happy with Ancelotti.
