Guardrails at the side of the nation's road which are supposed to offer protection in the event of a car crash could be making things worse according to an industry whistleblower.

A guardrail meant to save you in a crash could instead end up slicing through a car.

According to Josh Harman a 'design change' may be the cause of the problem on some 600,000 guardrails around the country.

Lawsuit: Joshua Harman is suing Trinity Highway Products LLC and its Dallas-based owner, Trinity Industries, Inc., alleging that it made a quiet design change that transformed guardrail systems across the U.S. into potentially deadly hazards

Whistleblower: Josh Harman says one particular model of guardrail is failing at an alarming rate

Harman, a guardrail engineer from Virginia.  He is the plaintiff in a federal 'False Claims Act' lawsuit against Texas-based Trinity Industries, maker of a popular model of guardrail end terminals

The guardrail end terminals ¿ or ¿heads¿ as they¿re called by engineers ¿ are designed to absorb the energy of a crash

If you look closely at guardrails you may have seen rectangles that are called 'guardrail end terminals' or 'heads'.

In a collision, the the force of the crash feeds the W-shaped guardrail into the head, where it gets flattened into a ribbon of steel, curling off to the side.

The process absorbs the energy of the crash and slows down the vehicle.

But Harman who is a manufacturer of guardrails and owns a company that installs and repairs the terminals says one of the biggest competitors has modified its end terminals without telling the government -- shrinking the length, the height and the width -- to save money.

One of many examples: Firefighters in Gurnee, Illinois, extricate a 22-year-old man who was impaled by a guardrail on June 9, 2013

Crashed out: Harman has gone around the country taking photos of accidents where the guardrails failed

On-message: Harman¿s lawsuit alleges that Trinity changed the dimensions of the ET-Plus guardrail some time between 2002 and 2005 without telling federal authorities. He says that he will not stop spreading his message until the designs are altered

Another example: Joshua Harman points to Darius Williams' Nissan Sentra in the junkyard. A length of guardrail pierced his door, according to the police report, driving the 24-year-old¿s body into the opposite back seat

In his whistleblower lawsuit, Harman says the new model 'causes the guardrail to double over on itself or protrude through the crashing vehicle.'

In a rather gruesome description, Harman says that during a crash the vehicle can flip around thje W shaped beam can cut through the metal of a car and slice of legs - even cut people in half.

Harman says he found this information while defending himself against a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Trinity HIghway Products; it ended with a confidential settlement.

Trinity claims that Harman is simply a sore loser and that he was forced to stop producing an end-terminal to the guardrail that was similar to theirs.

Harman told Bloomberg, 'That is something that is per se, a red herring, they're trying to distract from it. Whether I'm trying to sell the company or whether I'm trying to stay in business has no bearing on the fact that they're failing, people are getting injured, killed.'

Slight change: The guardrails have not been altered substantially but the suit alleges the end terminal piece has been reduced in width to four inches from five

On a mission: Josh Harman (right) goes from state to state and city to city telling anyone who will listen about the supposedly deadly guardrails

Harman claims to have identified more than 100 accidents in which the head of the guardrail failed to function properly.

In 2008, a crash in Tennessee killed a 38-year-old paramedic died when a guardrail entered the passenger compartment of her Honda.

Trinity has filed defamation lawsuits against Harman in several states.

The company claims that Harman 'has published false and malicious statements about its highway safety products, falsely claiming that ET-Plus heads are killing people ... and are failing completely.'

The suit claims 'Harman hopes to financially benefit from ... a class action lawsuit against the plaintiffs.'

The Federal Highway Administration approved the guardrail head design by Trinity, however Harman points out that changes were made after a crash test in May 2005. He alleges that the federal government were not notified about the changes.

Harman has made his position clear that he will not withdraw his whistleblower lawsuit, unless the deal includes a recall of the redesigned guardrail heads.
