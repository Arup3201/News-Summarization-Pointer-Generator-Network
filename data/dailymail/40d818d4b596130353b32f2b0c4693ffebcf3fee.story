The mother of murdered Tia Sharp broke down yesterday as she visited the scene where her daughter’s body was found.

Natalie Sharp wept uncontrollably and had to be physically supported by her partner, David Niles, as she left a message saying she wished she could have been there to ‘protect’ the 12-year-old.

She wailed ‘my little girl’ as she placed an orchid and teddy at a makeshift shrine yards from the home of her mother, Christine Sharp, where Tia’s body was discovered on Friday, a week after she was reported missing.

Miss Sharp, 31, spent five minutes at
 the scene before becoming so overwhelmed with grief that Mr Niles and 
another family friend had to carry her back to a police minibus.

The card for Tia, signed by Miss 
Sharp, Mr Niles and their two young sons, read: ‘Our baby girl. We love 
you very much. Always will. Sorry babe this never should have happened. I
 wish I was there to protect you.

Police finally discovered Tia's body and admitted they should have found it sooner

‘We know you’re safe now and you’re at home with us everywhere we go.’

Her visit came hours after 
37-year-old Stuart Hazell was charged with murder. As well as being 
Christine Sharp’s current partner, Hazell also at one time had a 
relationship with Natalie Sharp.

Tia, who lived in Merton, South 
London, regularly stayed with her grandmother. It was on Friday that 
investigators discovered the 12-year-old’s remains inside the house 
Hazell shared with Sharp in New Addington, near Croydon.

Officers had previously conducted a 
full search of the house and a second sweep using dogs trained to detect
 dead bodies. Colleagues suspect the body was behind a door connecting 
the loft to that of an adjacent property.

Sources claimed a team who spent two 
hours searching the property last Sunday did not check the neighbouring 
loft space because they needed a search warrant.

A further search of Sharp’s house 
began on Friday morning when a junior officer insisted a sniffer dog was
 ‘indicating’ towards a bedroom ceiling. The officers themselves could 
also smell decomposition.

Initially a senior officer co-ordinating the search said the loft had already been checked but was persuaded to change his mind.

Colleagues lifted the loft hatch and 
saw a large ‘container’, possibly a rigid suitcase, containing Tia’s 
body with her arms and legs sprawled outside.

The Metropolitan Police issued a 
statement at the weekend apologising for any ‘distress’ caused by the 
delay in finding the body.

Senior officers have launched an internal review into why the search operation failed.

Tia’s natural father, Steven Carter, 
30, who split from her mother shortly after she was born, visited the 
scene yesterday to lay a yellow rose with a pair of purple angel wings 
attached.

Accompanied by his father, brother and three female friends, he wept as he asked: ‘Why did this happen?’

Hugging his son, his father replied: 
‘There is no reason. She never harmed anybody, son. No child deserves 
this, especially my granddaughter.’

Mr Carter, who has Tia’s name 
tattooed on his arm, had earlier spoken of his horror at being ‘only 
feet away’ from his daughter’s body after travelling from his home in 
Northampton to help search for Tia last weekend.

He said: ‘That first night I stayed 
outside the house and they wouldn’t let me in, and Stuart Hazell walked 
over to me and put his hand on my shoulder and looked me in the eye. 
That now feels horrible.

‘Now it seems so much harder, because when I was outside that house, I was probably only feet away from her body.’
