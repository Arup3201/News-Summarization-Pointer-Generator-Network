A 23-year-old woman has learned to walk again after suffering horrific injuries when she was crushed under a truck while cycling to work at a school in Italy.

Mary Strutt, of Strathmiglo, Fife, suffered a broken pelvis, multiple fractures, broken vertebrae and punctured intestines when the lorry’s wheel ran over half of her body near Milan.

The teacher - who worked with seriously ill children - also had her ear reattached after it was sliced off in the crash, and has undergone rehabilitation and numerous operations on her path to recovery.

Her friends and family raised £7,000 for her healthcare, and she wanted to marry fiancé Daniele Gelfi - but he gave up work to care for her and their plans were halted by the huge bills they faced.

She said: ‘The most difficult part of my recovery was having to go around in a wheelchair, and even when I could walk, for a year even simple tasks made me very tired.

‘But I suppose the most long-standing difficulty I have is fear of roads - and though I'm doing better now, I still get frightened crossing them or being in a car on tight roads.

‘Daniele and I have decided to stay engaged until we recover, as it threw our jobs, plans and savings into the air. So while it is still our plan to get married, we won't be setting a date for now.’

Miss Strutt moved to Italy in 2007 to work at the Royal Acore School near Milan. Doctors feared she would die from her injuries when she was taken to hospital after the crash in May 2011.

But she battled back to health and has learned to walk again. Miss Strutt also claimed that the driver of the lorry did not apologise for the crash.

She said: ‘When I went into surgery they had to reattach my ear, set my shoulder, vertebrae, tailbone, and pelvis, and sealed up two open wounds that I had.

‘The driver of the truck, although he did have my number and details, never came to visit me. It would have been nice to see him, just to forgive him and know he was sorry.'

After leaving hospital she faced gruelling rehabilitation, including having her muscles stimulated with electricity.

She still cannot raise her right arm properly and suffers from swelling in her right leg.

But she added: ‘When these things happen to you, you have to decide whether it will ruin your life and make you bitter and miserable, or if you won't let it. I won't feel sorry for myself.

‘For me, the important thing is I'm here, I can walk, I'm pushing myself more every day and I'm happy.’
