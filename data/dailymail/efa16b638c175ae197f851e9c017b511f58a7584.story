A worried burglar rang police from the bedroom of a house he'd broken into to say he thought another raider was in the same home.

Marius Ionescu hid under the bed after hearing a noise downstairs while he was sifting through his victims' belongings.

Officers who raced to the house in Benesti, Romania, arrested the 31-year-old but failed to find anyone else at the scene.

Break-in: Benesti in Romania where a burglar called the police after he heard a noise in the property he was raiding

Police spokesman Mihaela Straub said: 'The noise he heard was probably just the family cat.

'He already has a criminal record for similar break-ins and given his nervous disposition he probably should look for another job.

'He's likely to have a lot of time inside jail to consider things.'
