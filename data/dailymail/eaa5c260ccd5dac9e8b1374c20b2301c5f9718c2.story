Clare Balding has shown off her slimmer look after shedding pounds by walking 12,000 steps a day.

The sports broadcaster, 44, used a step-counting machine as she went on a diet – and lost an impressive 20lb in under three months. 

Miss Balding said the weight loss had boosted her self-esteem.

Sports broadcaster Clare Balding (pictured with partner Alice Arnold earlier this week) used a step-counting machine and went on a diet – and lost an impressive 20lb in under three months

‘I’m more confident about my body now. I just think, “Get on with it, no one’s looking.”

'I’m less conscious of the things that don’t matter so much,’ she said.

In an interview with Woman & Home magazine, out on Thursday, she revealed her partner Alice Arnold, 52, had her reservations about the weight loss.

‘But when she saw me in it she thought I looked good. And I felt great,’ she added.

Miss Balding’s glamorous new look makes a change from the jeans and loose-fitting blouses she is more often seen wearing to present programmes such as Channel 4’s racing coverage.

 And it highlights just how much her shape has changed in recent years, after a bet with her mother spurred on to get in shape.

She had caught sight of herself looking ‘as if I’d been blown up with a bicycle pump’, she once said, on a TV monitor at the Newmarket races in 2013.

Miss Balding was spurred to get in shape after a bet with her mother, offering £100 per pound of weight shed to whoever lost the most. 

She used a Jawbone fitness band to count her steps, which she said made ‘a massive difference to my life’.

She walked 10,000 steps per day, monitored by a calorie-counting app, and went on a diet – although she has admitted not sticking to the 1,200 calorie limit.

And the result was a 20lb weight loss in the space of two-and-a-half months.

Tomorrow Miss Balding’s new entertainment and sport chat show begins on BBC2.

The channel acquired the rights from BT Sport and the programme will be screened on both channels.
