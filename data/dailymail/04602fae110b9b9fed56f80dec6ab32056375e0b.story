Brendan Rodgers has left no stone unturned ahead of Liverpool's International Champions Cup final match against Manchester United - by making his players train at Miami's Sun Life Stadium.

Liverpool face bitter rivals United in what can hardly be described as a pre-season friendly at Miami's Sun Life Stadium on Tuesday.

It will be the first time that Rodgers has come up against United's new manager Louis van Gaal, and he was determined his players would be in fighting-fit shape ahead of the game.
