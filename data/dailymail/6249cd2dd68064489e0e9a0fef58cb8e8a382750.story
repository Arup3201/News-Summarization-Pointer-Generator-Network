London is facing more than a week of travel chaos as an eight-day strike by Tube power workers gets underway tonight.

Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union and Unite are due to walk out from 8pm as part of a long-running row over pensions and working conditions.

Union leaders have warned that the strike could 'close the entire Tube system', causing 'severe disruption' to commuters in the capital.

But London Underground (LU) has insisted that the industrial action will have no impact on Tube services.

Today, Mick Cash, RMT acting general secretary, said the walkout follows the failure of last-ditch talks between union members and LU.

'This dispute is over an all-out attack on the power control grade that would hit pensions, length of service and working conditions and damage the futures of this key group of Tube workers,' he said.

'Management’s claim that they can run the system without them is both provocative and dangerous.

Around 40 
technicians based at the power control room at Blackfriars, which oversees 
power supply for the entire Tube network, are due to walk out from 8pm tonight.

The
 dispute involves employees who transferred to other organisations years
 ago, then returned to London Underground (LU) management with different
 pensions and working conditions.

A previous strike in May was called off for last-ditch talks, but these have reportedly now broken down.

Unions
 have warned the strike, which would still be on when the Tour de France
 cycle race visits London on July 7, could 'close the entire system' if 
an agreement is not reached.

But LU has insisted that the industrial action will have no impact on Tube services.

'These staff are effectively the national grid for London Underground and this action will have the most severe consequences for Tube operations, but has been forced on us by management wrecking the earlier talks.'

He added that there was still time to head off the strike, which will continue until 7.59pm on July 9.

Around 40 technicians based at the power control room at Blackfriars, which oversees power supply for the entire 270-station Tube network, are expected to walk out tonight.

The dispute involves employees who transferred to other organisations years ago, then returned to LU management with different pensions and working conditions.

A previous strike in May was called off to allow last-ditch talks, but these have reportedly now broken down.

Unions have warned the strike, which would still be on when the Tour de France cycle race visits London on July 7, could affect all Tube services if an agreement is not reached.

A Unite spokesman said: 'The blame for any disruption will lie with the management because this dispute should have been resolved weeks ago.

'The travelling public faces the very real prospect of their journeys being disrupted because of the irresponsibility of the management.'

However, Richard Jones, London Underground’s head of command and control, said: 'Due to detailed planning there will be no visible impact on the network should the strike action go ahead.

'We remain committed to discussions with Unite, TSSA and RMT representatives around working terms and conditions for staff in our power control team.

'I urge them to continue with constructive discussions rather than threaten pointless industrial action.'

The strike comes just months after Tube workers caused severe delays and travel chaos in the capital by walking out for 48 hours over plans to close ticket offices.
