Tens of thousands of people have signed an online petition calling for British CNN host Piers Morgan to be deported from the U.S. over his gun control views.

Morgan has demanded tighter U.S. gun laws following the Sandy Hook massacre and last week on Piers Morgan Tonight, he interviewed a gun advocate and called him an 'unbelievably stupid man'.

On December 21, a man in Texas launched a petition on the White House e-petition website demanding Morgan be deported immediately for 
'exploiting his position as a national network television host to stage 
attacks against the rights of American citizens'.

Divisive: A petition has been launched to deport Piers Morgan after he has taken a strict stance on gun laws

The petition accuses Morgan of engaging in a 'hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution' by targeting the Second Amendment - the right to bear arms.

It has already garnered more than 42,000 signatures - far exceeding the 25,000 signature threshold required to get a White House response.

But Morgan seemed unfazed by the effort to oust him.

In a series of Twitter messages, he urged his followers to sign the petition and in response to one article about the petition even said: 'Bring it on'.

He wrote: 'If I do get 
deported from America for wanting fewer gun murders, are there any other
countries that will have me?'

Speaking out: The petition had already garnered more than 40,000 signatures by Monday afternoon

He also insisted that he is not attacking the 
Constitution and only wants the U.S. to outlaw military-style assault 
weapons without infringing on people's 
rights.

In response to the petition, Jeremy Clarkson, the British Top Gear presenter, added on Twitter: 'Americans. It took us 40 years 
to get rid of Piers Morgan. Pleease don't send him back.'

Morgan will have to do more than express an opinion to get booted out the country, immigration attorney Mark Schifanelli told ABC News.

'He's got certain rights,' he said. 'Even as a foreign national in the United States, 
he's afforded various rights under national security law and due 
process.'

He added that Morgan's supposed attack 
on the Second Amendment would probably be protected by the First 
Amendment, his right to free speech.

Hitting back: Morgan has responded to the growing petition with a series of tweets

Outspoken: Morgan called gun advocate Larry Pratt 'an unbelievably stupid man' on his show last week

His remarks would have to present 'immediate danger' in order to break the law, but Schifanelli said it is unlikely that what Morgan has said has reached that requirement.

The discussion was sparked after a gunman opened fire at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, killing 20 children and six members of staff.

Following the tragedy last Tuesday, Morgan interviewed Larry Pratt, the executive director of Gun Owners of America.

When Pratt suggested that the answer to the America’s gun problem was more firearms in schools, Morgan responded: 'You’re an unbelievably stupid man aren't you? You have absolutely no coherent argument. You don't actually give a damn about the gun murder rate in America.'
