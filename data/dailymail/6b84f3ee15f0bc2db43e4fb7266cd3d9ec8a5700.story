We may enjoy the love and affection our pet provides, but a problem most dog owners can identify with is a pooch's pongy breath.

When canine friends get up close and personal that undeniable, hot, 'dog breath' can make us recoil.

But a dental company set up especially for dogs claims to provide the perfect cure.

The brush features four inline scrapers which you coat with poultry flavored 'Lickies' toothpaste

The Orapup ultra­soft, micro­pointed bristled paddle brush is said to reach deep into the crevices of your pet's tongue to clean up stench-inducing bacteria.

But you won't have to force your pooch to embrace it - as the toothpaste tastes like chicken.

The brush has four inline scrapers which you coat with poultry flavored 'Lickies' toothpaste, helping fight tartar with natural enzymes that neutralize the dog's mouth.

The gel collects and removes bacteria and residue, generated from the brushing, which helps cure a dog's bad breath.

The gluten and MSG free Lickies comes in three flavours: beef and bacon, cinnamon chicken, and cherry chicken. These 
are said to be fortified for oral health with additional benefits 
for skin, coat and joint health.

The 'toothpaste' contains brown 
rice syrup, natural flavors, grapefruit seed extract, 
grape seed extract, peptizyme, papain, sodium benzoate and potassium 
sorbate.

Now you can feed your pup all the stinky treats they love without having to worry about their breath

While some flavours, such as beef and 
bacon, have been specifically formulated for a dog's taste, makers say 
the product could also be used on a cat.

The entire starter kit which contains all essentials to get your started - a brush and two bottles of Lickies, appx 20 uses - comes in at less than £20, with additional postage fees.

The company ship free to some packages in the US, £3 for Canada and £6 for everywhere else, including the UK.

The brush comes in blue, pink, black and green, and daily use is recommended for the average dog.

As the Lickies gel is water soluble, you 
can simply rinse the Orapup off after each use with water or for a more thorough 
clean you can wash the device in the dishwasher.
