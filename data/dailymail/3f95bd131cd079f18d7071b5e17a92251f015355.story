A Pittsburgh woman convicted of stealing her cancer-stricken neighbor's dog and having the pet put down was sentenced to up to six months in jail on Friday.

An Allegheny County judge ruled that 58-year-old Gisele Paris will serve jail time followed by 18 months of probation for stealing an eight-year-old Siberian Husky from her sick neighbor and having the dog euthanized, CBS reported.

In December 2014, a jury found Paris guilty of theft, receiving stolen property and cruelty to animals. 

Paris claimed that she believed the dog, named Thor, was being neglected - despite a humane officer's assurances that Thor was not.

Thor's owner, Mark Boehler, who had been undergoing treatment for stage 3 esophageal cancer, pleaded for the safe return of the dog only to learn that Thor had been put down.

Thor disappeared from Boehler's fenced-in yard on Thanksgiving Day in 2013, but Paris held that she found the dog in a vacant lot.

'I think it was very fair and there is justice,' Mr Boehler told TribLive about the sentence. 'She's going to pay dearly ... I was hoping that the judge would be hard on her and he was.'

Paris claimed that she cared for the dog and took it to an animal hospital because it had been neglected but in February, decided to have it put down because the necessary treatments for the dog were too expensive.  

'He was everything I had,' Boehler told CBS. 'I don't have no children, so they're like members of the family. Everybody that has a pet, they know that.'

In court in December, an attorney said Paris' action was an attempt to hide the fact that she had stolen the dog as police went to her home in search of the Husky, according to the Post-Gazette.

'Gisele Paris was on a criminally delusional mission to take Thor from a situation, from conditions that she didn't approve of,' the attorney said during the weeklong trial. 

'Then it becomes more than she can deal with. The police close in on her, and she kills the dog to destroy the evidence.'

A memorial was held for the husky in March 2014, during December's court proceedings, Boehler was disappointed when the judge denied his request to have the dog's remains returned to him, the Post-Gazette reports. 

Paris said she buried the dog on her family's farm in Armstrong County. 

The judge denied Boehler's request and went on to say that it is unlikely that the dog's remains are on the farm, noting that the ground in Armstrong County is as 'hard as [a] desk,' which would have made it difficult for Paris to bury the remains there. 

Paris appeared shaken up in court on Friday, TribLive reports, and said she was remorseful. Her attorney acknowledged that Paris was wrong for having the dog euthanized.
