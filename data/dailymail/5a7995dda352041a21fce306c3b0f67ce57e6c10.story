Former Liverpool FC player and manager Kenny Dalglish was questioned about drunk and ticketless fans 'prone' to violence

Former Liverpool FC player and manager Kenny Dalglish was questioned about drunk fans 'prone' to violence who would try to get into grounds without tickets when giving evidence at the Hillsborough inquests today.

In a heated exchange, the barrister representing former Hillsborough match commander Superintendent David Duckenfield repeatedly asked Mr Dalglish about fan hooliganism.

John Beggs QC quizzed the former manager about what he had written in his autobiography about ticketless fans 'bunking in' to games – prompting angry scenes at the inquests.

Mr Dalglish was the team boss on the day the tragedy unfolded in April 1989 and broadcast a message to fans asking for calm at the request of South Yorkshire Police.

Ninety-six Liverpool fans died from the crush at the Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest got under way.

Mr Beggs pointed out that in Mr Dalgish's 2010 book My Liverpool Home, he spoke of 'Scousers' climbing through windows and using ropes to get into Wembley Stadium.

He write that the fans were 'bunking in to the most famous stadium in the world for the final of the oldest trophy in football' for the Liverpool v Everton FA Cup Final in 1986.

Mr Beggs read another passage in which Mr Dalglish gave his reaction when the official attendance was given at the game - 98,000.

'I just laughed, as there must have been 110,000 crammed in, beneath the twin towers.'

The barrister told the court, here was an 'icon' of the game of football, and especially to Liverpool fans, 'laughing at the fact they broke the law' by gaining entry to a football ground without tickets.

Mr Dalglish said he laughed at the official attendance figures - not people allegedly 'bunking in'.

Mr Beggs then moved on to a post-match Home Office report about the FA Cup Final in 1989, another all-Merseyside final, a month after the Hillsborough disaster.

The report spoke of the 'sheer scale' of attempts to bunk in from fans from Merseyside, which was 'troubling'.

Mr Dalglish said the 'clamber for tickets' for the all-Merseyside Cup Final was 'overwhelming' to 'show their unity and support for the families who had lost loved ones at Hillsborough'.

The witness was then asked about what he had written in his book about the Heysel disaster of 1985 involving Liverpool fans in which 39 rival Juventus fans were killed.

Mr Dalglish had written that only 'chicken wire' separated the groups of 'passionate' supporters which was inadequate.

Mr Beggs continued: 'Are you not acknowledging that within the Liverpool supporters there was a cohort of supporters prone to violence?'

'No,' Mr Dalglish replied.

Rajiv Menon QC, representing some of the families of victims of the disaster, also questioned the former manager about the behaviour and reputation of Liverpool fans in the 1980s. 

Mr Dalglish replied saying: 'I think Liverpool football fans, with that one exception, were very highly respected and revered. I think they were well known for the support they gave the team.'

Pete Weatherby QC, also representing families, asked the witness if, in his opinion, there was 'no connection whatsoever' between what happened at Hillsborough and the Heysel disaster.

Mr Dalglish replied: 'Heysel, it's people fighting and people have been arrested and charged and jailed.' 

Wearing a suit with a red and white striped tie and a '96' badge, Mr Dalglish also told the inquests there was no way he would have objected to a request to delay the kick off.

The jury heard that Mr Dalglish arrived with his team at 1.30pm on the day and went straight to the dressing room where he remained until just before kick-off.

When asked by Christina Lambert, counsel to the inquests about the six minutes between kick-off and the referee stopping play, Mr Dalglish said his focus was on the game.

'We were watching what we were doing during the game and making sure that we were organised and we were doing our job properly,' he said. 

He described the 'mayhem' at Hillsborough during the disaster.

'Nobody knew what was going on,' he told the inquests. 'There were stories coming from every angle.'
