As far as things to do with your children, it's certainly not the most common activity.

But a mother-of-one has defend her decision to pole dance with her two-year-old daughter, saying she is an advocate of attachment parenting.

Ashley Wright, from California, US, posted a video on Facebook of herself performing on her pole while holding Shannon Marie, which has now been viewed more than 500,000 times. 

The three-minute footage starts with Ashley, dressed in skimpy black underwear, spinning around the pole as her toddler wanders into the room, holding her hands towards her. 

Ashley can then be seen picking up her young child and resumes spinning round the pole with the toddler clasped in her arms.

Later in the routine, the mother seductively writhe around on the floor as Shannon Marie appears totally entertained and attempts to join in.

Ashley says she is an extreme advocate of attachment parenting - a style intended to create a very empathetic and nurtured child.

Some of the hallmarks of attachment parenting are co-sleeping with the entire family and babywearing (where an infant is worn in a sling).

Ashley said she hasn't been shocked by the negative reaction she has received and claims her dancing demonstrated a strong mother-daughter bond.

'It is no surprise that many are put off, and even more confused by this shared display of divine femininity, sensual acceptance, power and open, unapologetic, love for self and for my child,' she said.

'Unfortunately, many did not receive nor have bared witness to this form of love and therefore only see what is they can connect with; shame.' 

Nearly 5,000 people have commented on the video. Johanna Marie wrote: 'It looked like the baby was reaching up for mommy but she's to busy dancing on the pole with her undergarments.'

Jo-Ann Sagat added: 'Nothing wrong with pole dancing but not when you should be spending time with your child... do it when the child is in bed...that is NOT the time to be doing it.'

And Kyralee Swann said: 'How about teaching your daughter to read or count or spell, instill qualities in her that will make her bright and successful?

'Instead of instilling skills in her that will only benefit her if she needs to degrade herself for money.'

On her website Ms Wright's Way, she writes: 'It is okay to be 100 per cent committed to your child(ren) and loved ones. In doing so make sure that you take the time to give to yourself. 

'Get your hair done, go to a game, practice the yoga, take the zumba class, because if you don’t continue to give to yourself you compromise the quality of care for others.'
