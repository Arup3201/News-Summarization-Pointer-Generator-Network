Katherine Jackson has
broken her silence after 'deserting' her grandchildren for ten 
days - to claim she 'wasn't kidnapped' and 'just needed a rest'.

Following days of escalating tensions amongst her feuding family Katherine was filmed by  ABC news claiming: 'There are rumours going around about me that I
have been kidnapped... I am here today to let everybody to know that I 
am good and fine.

'My children would never do anything to me like that. It's stupid.'

In
a bizarre show of unity her children Jermaine, Janet and Rebbie stood 
close around the anxious 82-year-old as she read out a prepared 
statement at the luxury resort where she has been staying.

Katherine seemed confused at times, calling grandson Prince 'my nephew'.

Emotional: Katherine Jackson read a statement to ABC as she claimed she was 'devastated' to lose custody and said she had been on a 'short vacation'

Bizarre: Katherine was surrounded by family in a show of unity, with Janet, Jermaine, Rebbie and Rebbie's daughter joining her, along with the marketing manager for the Tuscon resort where she has been staying

Earlier the Jackson family 
matriarch had lost custody of her late son Michael's three children after a judge
awarded temporary guardianship of the trio to their cousin TJ.

Prince,
15, Paris, 14, and Blanket, 10 will be cared for by their 34-year-old 
cousin who had been staying with them in their grandmother's absence.

Katherine said: 'I am devastated that while I've been away, my grandchildren have been taken away from me and I'm coming home.'

And she claimed the move was 'based on a bunch of lies.'

Supportive? Janet and Jermaine whispered to each other and exchanged glances

But she failed to explain why she hadn't notified her three wards of her intention to take a 'short vacation and rest'.

'One reason I didn't call is I just gave up my phone and I didn't want to have any phone calls while I was here,' she said.

Katherine also confirmed that she had left her grandson TJ in charge.

The film crew were told they were not to ask Katherine any questions as she read the statement.

At one stage Janet and Jermaine exchanged glances and whispered.

Katherine also explained that her assistant had been in contact with her grandson Prince.

'He said everything 
was going fine back home,' she said. 'Still I think about the children... worry 
about them but they're fine.'

She then confirmed reports that she had spoken to her grandchildren after ten days without contact.

'I told them I would come home today and they're waiting for me to come,' she said.

Bizarrely she also repeatedly thanked the resort where she had been staying, adding: 'I had a very good time here - and if anyone wants to rest I think they should come here.'

ON THE 'KIDNAPPING'

There are rumors going around about me that I have been kidnapped and held against my will.

I am here today to let everybody know that I am fine and I am here with my children, and my children would never do a thing to me like that, holding me against my will.

It's very stupid for people to think that.

ON THE LOSS OF CUSTODY OF HER GRANDCHILDRENI am devastated that while I've been away, that my children, my grandchildren, have been taken away from me, and I'm coming home to see about that, also.

WHO WAS LOOKING AFTER HER GRANDCHILDREN?

Before I left I put everything in order with the appropriate people to take care of my children for me and it's really bad to hear that what's going on at home, and the children have been taken away - but I know that... I'll get there in time to get them back.

And after I finish this, I will be on my way home.

WHERE DID SHE GO?I am grateful for my children that they saw that I needed rest and they wanted to take me away for a while, just a short vacation and rest up.

They have taken good care of me and have made sure that I got the rest that I needed.

WHY DIDN'T SHE CALL?One reason I haven't called is I just gave up my phone and I didn't want to have any phone calls while I was here.

The latest feud between the Jacksons is said to have been stemmed from a dispute over Michael Jackson's $500million will.

Jackson died in June 2009 at age 50 
and left his estate to care for his mother and three children. He left 
nothing to his father or siblings, who have repeatedly tried to 
intervene in the estate. 

Several have expressed doubts about the validity of his will, although the courts have rejected this.

Following yesterday's ruling TJ, the son of Michael's brother 
Tito, will now get access to funds from the estate in order to 
care for the children, who are said to be in favour of him being their 
temporary guardian.

Before the judge: An artist's impression of TJ's court hearing

TJ became tearful in court as he told Judge Mitchell Beckloff how he had a
strange phone conversation with Katherine.

'I've never heard my grandmother talk like that,' said TJ, who once dated Kim Kardashian.

Saying
he thought she was talking in code, he went on: 'She wasn't sharp. The 
pauses, choice of vocabulary... she has not used certain phrases like 
that before.'

Members
of her house are said to have been 'alarmed and nervous' after 
Katherine's call - with sources telling TMZ the 'prevailing view
is that Randy and company have drugged their mom'.

Judge Beckloff said that his understanding was that TJ's application was not a 'power play'.

While members of the Jackson clan
are feuding over Michael's estate TJ is not one of them.

Earlier this week TJ's father Tito 
withdrew from the plot - involving Randy, Janet, Jermaine and Rebbie - 
to overthrow the executors of their brother's will, which leaves everything
to his children and nothing to them.

Judge Beckloff said Katherine's 
guardianship was not suspended for wrongdoing - but argued she has been 
prevented from doing her duties by 'intentional acts from third parties'
-
an apparent reference to Randy, Janet, Jermaine and Rebbie.

Tough
talk: Katherine lawyer, Perry Sanders, gives a press conference after 
the hearing and said he will file a motion to get her reinstated as 
guardian upon her return to LA

TJ's attorney, Charles A. Schultz described the situation as dire.

He
said: 'There's immediate harm to the minor children, there was a 
potential abduction at the house, in addition to a phone call from 
Katherine last night that gave us real concern.

Schultz went on: 'We are looking at this as a Band-Aid until Miss Jackson returns or re-establishes contact with the kids.'

One of Katherine's lawyers, Sandra Ribera, added: 'I have reason to believe she's being held against her will.'

Confused: Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson have been pining for their grandmother over recent days

Another of Katherine's lawyers, Perry
Sanders, said he will file a motion to get her re-instated as guardian 
upon her return to LA.

The judge also ordered that Prince, 
Paris and Blanket should not be removed from California without a court 
order - and urged TJ to file for permanent guardianship.

TJ claimed he had previously assisted his grandmother with caring for his cousins.

In court papers seen by website TMZ he claims that before Katherine left the house she had placed her grandchildren in his care.

Daily updates: Paris tweeted this picture of herself

And in a new twist TJ also alleged 
that his aunts and uncles arranged for a 'fake' doctor to convince his 
grandmother to abandon plans to attend a concert, instead going to a 
luxury spa to rest.

The court case was simply the latest 
twist in an ongoing sage which began when Katherine left the house over a
week ago, telling her grandchildren she was going to see her sons in 
concert.

She did not return or contact her grandchildren.

With a worried Paris tweeting that 
her grandmother was 'missing' concerns arose that Katherine had been 
'kidnapped by her children', with her own lawyers even stating 
that this was the case.

Police stepped in and performed a 
welfare visit, with the 82-year-old found to be in good spirits at her 
daughter Rebbie's house in Arizona.

But she still failed to contact her 
young wards, with her son Jermaine admitting he had cut off her access 
to phones for her own 'well being'.
