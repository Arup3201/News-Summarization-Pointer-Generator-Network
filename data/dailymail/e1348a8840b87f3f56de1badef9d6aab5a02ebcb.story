It has been her lifelong dream to break away from the show that propelled her to fame and cement her name as a model - and now Kendall Jenner is making her fantasy a reality.

The youngest of the Kardashian clan walked in the season's hottest fashion week shows and was last week unveiled as the face of Estee Lauder.

Now Karl Lagerfeld, the industry's most esteemed designer, has revealed that Kendall has been chosen as the face of his SS15 campaign.

Rising star: Kendall Jenner has made the break from Keeping Up With The Kardashians star to in-demand model - and now Karl Lagerfeld has snapped her up to front his self eponymous campaign 

According to WWD, the 19-year-old joins fellow Lagerfeld favourites Sasha Luss, Ming Xi and Baptiste Giabiconi in the campaign, which has already been shot at his Paris studio.

So, could a Chanel campaign be next on the cards for the burgeoning star? 

Kendall is no stranger to the prestigious French fashion house and has already walked in Lagerfeld's shows. 

If she does land the glossy campaign, she will replace best friend and current face of Chanel, Cara Delevingne.

Cara, 23, recently revealed that she will be focussing more on acting in the New Year, which could well leave the role open for Kendall. 

Kendall's meteoric rise in the fashion industry from her reality TV roots has led her to compare her double life to that of a certain Disney Channel star.

'It's definitely two different worlds. I feel like Hannah Montana. But it's fun,' the model told the New York Times.

The brunette socialite currently appears on the KUWTK spin-off Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons, which airs Sundays on E! 

Viewers have seen her grow up in front of the camera as she first appeared on Keeping Up With the Kardashians at the age of 11.

The daughter of Kris Jenner and half sister of Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian, some have questioned whether Kendall has won her modelling contracts on merit or because she's part of the famous family. 

Moving with the times: Estee Lauder have named Kendall as their new face and asked her to announce the news via her social media accounts

Indeed many were surprised when she was named as the new face of Estee Lauder as in the past they have gone for more established A-listers such as Gwyneth Paltow and Elizabeth Hurley. 

But it seems the cosmetics giant are keen to appeal to a younger, internet-savvy market, making Kendall the perfect choice. She has more than 9 million followers on Twitter and 16m followers on Instagram.

They capitalised on her online popularity by getting her to announce her appointment with them via her social media accounts - including a link to their website showcasing her favourite products.

Now many in the fashion industry believe Kendall's star power will keep increasing and could eventually elevate her to the status of supermodel.

Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing told Vogue: 'Kendall is the new pop-culture model. She's inspiring girls in the way Claudia Schiffer or Naomi Campbell did. They aspire to look like her.'
