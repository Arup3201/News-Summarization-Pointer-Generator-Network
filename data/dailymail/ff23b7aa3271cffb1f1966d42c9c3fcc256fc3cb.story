Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino has had a complete change of heart by insisting he will embark on the first European campaign of his managerial career with a view to winning the Europa League.

Unsurprisingly he likes the incentive of the invite to the Champions League that comes with the trophy and it will be interesting to see to what extent Tottenham’s priorities change after the New Year, if they are off the pace in the Barclays Premier League but still in this competition.

Until then, there are caveats galore from Pochettino, who dismissed the Europa League as a competition that ‘kills you’ when he was at Southampton.

‘It’s not a competition that’s attractive to me,’ he had said in February. ‘I don’t see the appeal. It’s for teams not good enough to be playing with the best.’

His tune has changed, and who can blame him? It still takes 16 games to make it from this stage to the final in Warsaw in May, but UEFA have upped the ante with the Champions League place on offer and the Argentinian has moved to Spurs, where he has a stronger squad and greater expectation than at Southampton.

‘The Europa League is now a different competition,’ said Pochettino here last night. ‘Why? Well, if you won it last year you basically got nothing, just a trophy. Now the Europa League gives you the opportunity to play in the Champions League. That is a big challenge for us.’

Nevertheless, Tottenham travelled to Cyprus for the first leg of their play-off tie against AEL Limassol with a 21-man squad missing several senior players.

Five of those who started at West Ham on Saturday have not travelled — Aaron Lennon, Younes Kaboul, Emmanuel Adebayor, Christian Eriksen and Etienne Capoue — and there could be as many as nine changes.

Goalkeeper Hugo Lloris prefers to carry on playing as will Kyle Naughton, sent off at Upton Park and banned from Sunday’s home game against Queens Park Rangers. Both should start.

Back-up keeper Michel Vorm has not been included in the squad for this round after an extended World Cup with Holland. Providing Spurs qualify, they will submit another squad before the group stage which starts next month after the transfer window has closed.

It is a calculated risk against AEL. The runners-up in the Cypriot League should not trouble Spurs but they gave Zenit St Petersburg, managed by Andre Villas-Boas, a fright in the Champions League qualifiers, beating the Russians 1-0 in Larnaca before losing 3-0 away. Tottenham are still capable of fielding a strong team, such is the depth available, and Pochettino intends to work closely with his medical team and the club’s sports scientists to monitor individual fitness levels as the season unfolds. 

‘The year is very difficult because of the World Cup,’ he said. ‘The players came in to train at different times. We need to analyse each case and work to decide what is best for the player and the team. We need to be clear when we start a recovery, not only (a player’s) physical performance but his psychology, too.’

Temperatures are expected to reach 38˚C in Larnaca, where AEL Limassol play their European games in Anorthosis Famagusta’s Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium because their own does not meet UEFA’s floodlight standards.

‘We travelled four-and-a-half hours from London,’ said Pochettino. ‘It is more than 30 degrees and it is tough for the players. It is a different environment. We need to be focused and ready. 

‘We need to change our chip — our way of thinking — because AEL will be difficult opponents.’

AEL’s Bulgarian coach Ivaylo Petev is aware his side’s task is a tall one, but insisted: ‘There is belief.’

Pochettino will be satisfied if it all begins in the same way as his European debut as a player, also in Cyprus, when Espanyol beat APOEL Nicosia 3-2 on aggregate in the UEFA Cup in 1996.
