A Maryland man who is believed to have abducted his 11-year-old daughter after killing her mother, is facing a murder charge.

The search for Timothy Virts and his daughter, Caitlyn, has become a nationwide operation, with police believing his daughter could be in danger.

Virts is wanted in connection with the death of his wife, Bobbie Jo Cortez, who was found with multiple cuts to her upper body on Thursday morning.

The FBI believe Virts, 38, may have left the state and taken Caitlyn with him after Ms Cortez's body was discovered at her Dundalk home.

An autopsy was due to take place on Friday, and police have not said what used to inflict the injuries.

Police spokeswoman Elise Armacost said probable cause for the murder charge was based on physical evidence and interviews with people in the house at the time Ms Cortez was killed.

Caitlyn's twin sister and Ms Cortez's young son, as well as two other adults, were also living at the home.

Armacost said Virts had been staying there too, for the past several weeks.

The FBI said that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Maryland has charged Virts with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.

The agency said it is searching nationwide for Caitlyn and Virts and is working to put up digital billboards across the country on the search.

An Amber Alert issued in Maryland was expanded late Thursday to include West Virginia.

A police spokesman told WUSA9 they believed Virts had connections to West Virginia and were 'doing our due diligence' to follow tips.

Authorities said anyone who sees Caitlyn, Virts or the vehicle Virts is believed to be driving should call 911. Virts may be armed and is dangerous.

Victim: Bobbie Jo Cortez was found in her home, covered in multiple cuts, on Thursday

He may be driving a black 1999 Dodge Durango with Maryland plates 5AJ4458. The car is registered to Ms Cortez's husband, Daniel Williams Cortez.

Mr Cortez, 38, is currently being held at the Baltimore County Detention Center on sexual assault charges. Police said they do not believe he has anything to do with the murder of his wife.
