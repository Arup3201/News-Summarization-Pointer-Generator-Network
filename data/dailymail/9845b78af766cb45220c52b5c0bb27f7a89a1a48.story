An Iowa man renovating his basement has found what police believe to be the skeletal remains of its former occupant who went missing three years ago.

Police in Sac City say the new homeowner of six months discovered the human remains on Monday with 58-year-old Mark Koster having vanished in July of 2009.

'All signs point to believe that it’s probably Mr Koster, but you never know,' Sac City police Chief John Thomsen told the Sioux City Journal.

Human remains: A man renovating his home made a horrific discovery when finding human remains believed to belong to its former owner, Mark E. Koster, pictured, who vanished in 2009

No one had lived in the home since Mr Koster's disappearance with it being sold to its new owner in May of this year.

Sandra Dierenfeld who lived next door to Mr Koster said the last communication she had with the man was through a note on his door.

It said he and his roommate, a man from Florida whom police say could be suspect, were going on a trip.

'Yeah they were just gone. They left a note saying they were going to Florida, they'd see me in the spring, please take care of the property,' she said. 

Grave site: The homeowner had purchased the property in May of this year after it sat unoccupied for three years after Mr Koster's disappearance

Ms Dierenfeld says Mr Koster was a smoker and in noticeably bad health.

She thinks if the remains are his, Mr Koster's death may have been a suicide.

'His accounts were never touched; everything was left intact in the house. I think it was what he wanted,' she said.

Daniel Koster, his brother, was the first to report him missing having received notice that his brother's utility bills weren't being paid.

Final note: The last anyone heard from Mr Koster was a neighbour who said he left a note on his door saying he was going on a trip with a friend, the property's basement pictured

After his brother's petition, Mr Koster was declared dead as of October 10, 2011.

An autopsy is currently underway to confirm the identity with its results expected Thursday or Friday.

The examiner is not ruling out the possibility of foul play.

'We don't know for sure. That's why we need to wait to get the results back and, hopefully identification. Then we'll go from there,' said Chief Thomsen.
