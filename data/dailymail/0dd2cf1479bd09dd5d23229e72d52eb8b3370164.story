A taxpayer-funded body has sparked anger among Tories by spending £1 million on a film based on the antics of the Bullingdon Club, the notorious Oxford University society that counted David Cameron and Boris Johnson as members.

The British Film Institute is using the Lottery money to help fund a film adaptation of the West End hit Posh.

It follows the drunken exploits of The Riot Club, who cause havoc after descending on a pub for one of their dinners.

Members are portrayed as upper-class yobs who sneak a prostitute into the venue before wrecking the pub and assaulting the landlord.

In one scene, a former member of The Riot Club – now a Tory MP – explains how he has managed to limit the fallout resulting from their behaviour.

The film, due to be released next year, will feature Jeremy Irons’s son Max, Douglas Booth and Natalie Dormer, the star of Game Of Thrones.

Last night Tory MP Lee Scott said: ‘I have to question the timing and motive in awarding Lottery money for what looks like a politically biased film to be released on the eve of the next General Election.’

Complaints: Tory MPs have criticised the film about the notorious society for being politically-motivated. Some of the party's leading figures were part of the club while studying at Oxford (pictured)

Fellow Tory Angie Bray added: ‘This looks like revenge for George Osborne cutting film industry subsidies.’

The BFI said: ‘A major part of our role as the UK’s leading film organisation is to help British talent develop their careers. 

‘Posh is an excellent example of a British story told by a first-time British screenwriter, with British producers and featuring a cast of young British actors.’
