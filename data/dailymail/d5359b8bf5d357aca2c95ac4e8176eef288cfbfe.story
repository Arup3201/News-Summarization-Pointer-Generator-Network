A south African businessman was today fined £610 after he spilled a drink on the country's president Jacob Zuma.

Daryl Peense, 34, was ordered to pay up or face two months in prison after he was convicted of assault over the incident.

The company boss was found guilty in July when a court heard he deliberately tipped a glass of whisky on Mr Zuma, 69, last year at a race course.

The father of one, who runs an online betting firm, has always claimed the incident was an accident.

Today he told of his relief that he had avoided a custodial sentence over the spillage but said he was angry that he had been prosecuted at all.

He said: 'This was a total over-reaction to a silly incident.

'They said I deliberately spilled my drink but that's simply not true.

'I'm relieved today as they had warned me I might get sent to prison, but it still feels like a heavy-handed sentence.

'I'm angry that they prosecuted me at all for something so stupid and will have to live with a criminal record now forever.'

Today's sentencing came after Peense was arrested and charged following his encounter with Mr Zuma last July at a racing event in the city of Durban.

The businessman was held when of the president's bodyguards told police he saw him deliberately tipping his drink over Mr Zuma from a balcony.

This whole thing has been a total nightmare.

I have had this hanging over me for more than a year and am badly out of pocket with all the legal fees.

Mr Zuma had been attending the event with an entourage and was walking around the VIP enclosure when Peense spotted him from a first floor private box.

The court heard one of the president's companions used his jacket to deflect the liquid as it fell from above.

Peense, from Alberton, near Johannesburg, admitted spilling his Johnnie Walker Black Label whisky but claimed he had done so accidentally.

His lawyer told the court he was drunk at the time of the incident, which happened at 4pm.

A magistrate today handed him the £610 fine or a four month prison sentence, of which two months were suspended.

The entrepreneur was also ordered to attend a six month rehabilitation course for alcohol abuse.

Speaking after the sentencing, Peense claimed the court battle had cost him £10,500.

He said: 'This whole thing has been a total nightmare.

'I have had this hanging over me for more than a year and am badly out of pocket with all the legal fees.

'My business has suffered as I haven't been able to concentrate on my work.

'All of this because I spilled a drink on the president - it's just absolutely ridiculous.'
