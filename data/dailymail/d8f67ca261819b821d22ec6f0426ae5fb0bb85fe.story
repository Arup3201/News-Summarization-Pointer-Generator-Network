Parents held: Ella Henderson's parents were arrested yesterday in a money laundering investigation

The brother of X-Factor star Ella Henderson said today the arrest of their parents on suspicion of money laundering could ruin the start of her singing career.

Officers swooped on two large detached 
houses owned by the teenage singerâ€™s father Sean Henderson, 47, and 
mother Michelle, 49, in the village of Tetney, near Grimsby.

Ella's brother Patrick, 25, said that the singer, who is currently recording her debut album, has been a 'great ambassador' for her local area - and he worries that her prospects will be affected by the raids.

The singer, 17, is currently living 
in London where she is putting the finishing touches to her album after 
starring on the ITV talent show last year.

Her
mother was arrested at the family home in Tetney, while her father, who
is also her manager, was arrested in London by officers from the 
Metropolitan Police.

He is expected to be driven back up north for questioning by Humberside Police.

Speaking from the family's smaller detached, Patrick said today that he hoped Ella's reputation would not be hit by the arrests.

'Everyone
knows whose house this is. We don't want any bad press for her. She has
been an ambassador for this area. It could ruin the start of her early 
career,' he said.

'All 
we are asking for is to make sure not to get anything out of proportion 
and try not to get carried away about something that has been ongoing 
for a while. We are co-operating with the police.

'Michelle is fine. Everyone is fine. It was a shock to us when they all arrived. It is all part of an on-going investigation.'

Mr and Mrs Henderson are still being held in police custody today.

Officers with dogs searched the 
red-brick Tetney Manor and their second home - a four-bedroom property 
complete with swimming pool and jacuzzi four doors away yesterday.

There were two dog section vans and a number of scenes of crime officers at the Henderson's home for up to six hours.

And the large police presence in the village was supported by the specialist underwater search team.

Divers were seen combing The Beck, which runs through Tetney, but it is unclear why.

Investigation: The star's parents Sean and Michelle were arrested as police searched the property. Underwater teams were also searching nearby

At least six police vehicles were 
parked outside their larger property yesterday and officers searching 
for evidence were seen going in and out 
with bags and boxes.

The Metropolitan Police arrested Mr 
Henderson, a former car dealer who also made a fortune in property in 
Dubai, in London, acting on instruction from Humberside Police, at 
around the same time the Mrs Henderson was arrested in Tetney.

Mr and Mrs Henderson have two daughters - Ella and her sister Holly, as well as two sons.

Neighbour Miles Balderson said: 'I could not believe the amount of police activity.'

Local caretaker Bartholomew Easton, 
59, said: 'They bought a little cottage on Thoresby Road about five or 
six years and demolished it and then put up a massive luxury house on 
the two acres site.

'They have then called it Tetney Manor, even though there is already a really good old Grade II manor house in the village.'

Officers: The raid at the home in Tetney, Lincolnshire was connected to allegations of money laundering
