Tasmanian hoteliers have been advised to offer Chinese tourists free underwear, cup noodles, disposable slippers and 'fancy' condoms.

The booklet of recommendations was released by the Tasmanian Hospitality Association as a 'practical guide' to help get businesses 'China ready'.

The 16-page pamphlet, funded by the state government and launched on Monday, provides information that will ensure all operators maximise their opportunities whilst also providing high-quality visitor experiences, THA general manager Steve Old said.

The booklet was released by the Tasmanian Hospitality Association on Monday to help get businesses 'China ready'

'It's about just understanding the very basic needs of a Chinese guest and understanding that they might not react in the same that we do,' Mr Old told the ABC.

'So it's about putting it to the simplest terms for any operator...to be able to understand their needs.'

Other recommendations include free souvenirs, children's toys and unrefrigerated bottled water.

The booklet also warns restaurateurs that Chinese diners can be 'noisy' and 'prone to back-slapping'.

Tasmania's Premier and Tourism Minister, Will Hodgman, says there has been a 50 per cent increase in Chinese nationals arriving in Tasmania in the last 12 months to March this year

'We're getting almost 20,000 Chinese visitors coming into Tasmania now, and there's no doubt that that's going to increase,' he told the ABC.

Author Bob Priestley says the information published in the booklet is based on extensive research.

He added that theÂ Chinese hospitality industry was very attentive to the needs of their guests.

'When I got to China, they fuss over me. If I go to a Chinese restaurant, they fuss over me, they want me to have a good time,' he said.

Mr Hodgman said the state government is committed to a target of attracting 1.5 million visitors to Tasmania per year by 2020, which would hopefully create up to 8,000 new jobs.
