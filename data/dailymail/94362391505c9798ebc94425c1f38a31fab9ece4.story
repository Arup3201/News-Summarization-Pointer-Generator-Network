The mother of a 16-year-old girl who was filmed being attacked in a brutal Snapchat video has revealed that her daughter was drugged, sexually assaulted and left for dead.

Suspect Rashad Deihim, 19, who had been on the run, turned himself into police on Saturday and is now in custody alongside Kailyn Bonia, 18, and a minor co-defendant, aged 17.

The trio are accused of the horrific attack on 3 September in woods behind Waybright Elementary School in Sangus, Massachusetts.

The video shows the teenagers assaulting and starting to rape the naked and impaired 16-year-old girl, as she desperately tries to get away,  according to prosecutors.

Suspect Rashad Deihim, 19, (pictured yesterday) had been on the run for weeks, turned himself into police on Saturday

Suspect Rashad Deihim, 19, (left) is now in custody alongside Kailyn Bonia, 18, (right) and a minor co-defendant, aged 17. Police found the severely intoxicated 16-year-old after a friend of the victim saw the graphic footage on Snapchat and recognized the location before leading police to the scene

Police found the severely intoxicated 16-year-old after a friend of the victim saw the graphic footage on the video and photo-sharing app recognized the location and led them to the scene. 

Court documents state the girl was foaming at the mouth when she arrived at hospital, possibly on a narcotic and had cuts all over body  - when detectives interviewed her days later she could not recalled what had happened.

The victim's mother told WHDH, her daughter was drugged, sexually assaulted and left for dead.

 'What they did was disgusting it was sick, I almost lost my daughter,' the mother said. 

'She was barely breathing she was found with nothing on.'  

'She had fingerprints, at least two hands held down by her throat. '

Police found the girl partially-naked and covered in cuts and bruises in woods behind Waybright Elementary School (pictured) in Sangus, Massachusetts

'Her breasts were bruised, her whole body was ripped, shredded, broken toes.'

'Somebody noticed who it was and called the cops, and if this person didn't call the cops my daughter wouldn't be here right now,' the mom said. 

Yesterday Assistant Essex District Attorney Erin Bellavia stated graphic details of the video, in which she said Deihim can be clearly identified, reports the Boston Herald. 

Deihim had his pants unzipped and suspect  Bonia can be 'seen wrapping her arms around the victim's neck as if she was strangling her while grabbing at the victim's naked body,' Bellavia said. 

Deihim (pictured) and Bonia are charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or older, posing a child in a state of nudity and kidnapping

Deihim, who denies the charges, was deemed dangerous and held without bail alongside Bonia

'She attempted to run away naked in one of the videos but she could not because she was so impaired,' Bellavia said and added that she is seen shaking her head as if to to protest against their actions.

Bellavia said the unnamed 17-year-old male suspect who sent the Snapchat videos to a friend of the victim's can be 'heard in the background laughing in the videos.' 

Deihim and Bonia are charged with assault with intent to rape, indecent assault and battery on a person 14 or older, posing a child in a state of nudity and kidnapping. 

The minor co-defendant is charged as a juvenile with identical charges and distribution of child pornography. 

The victim's mother is calling for the trio to be charged with attempted murder saying: 'Somebody noticed who it was and called the cops, and if this person didn't call the cops my daughter wouldn't be here right now,'

A report by an officer who arrived at the scene said: 'The female appeared to be extremely intoxicated.

'I conducted a search of the area and located what we believe is the scene where the sexual activity took place on a floral print couch in the wooded area about 100 feet from the baseball field.'  

Lynn court records show Deihim has been the subject of four restraining orders, according to the Boston Globe - one on behalf of a younger sibling, one from his mother, and two for a female Saugus High student

The victim's friend who received the Snapchat videos took screen shots, according to a police report.

The victim's friend asked the juvenile defendant where he was and he said, 'Waybright, but then realized he gave up where they were and panicked,' the report said.

The two friends spoke after the victim was released from the hospital which is when the victim thanked the girl 'for saving her life,' the report said.

Yesterday Deihim, who denies the charges, was deemed dangerous and held without bail alongside Bonia. 

According to reports, when Bonia was arrested she called Deihim to alert him and said: 'Dude, I'm like being held for all these charges. Where is (juvenile defendant), this is all his fault. They should have him.'

Deihim's lawyer, David Newton, said, 'Mr. Deihim turned himself in so he can answer to these charges. ... He's innocent till proven guilty.'

Lynn court records show Deihim has been the subject of four restraining orders, according to the Boston Globe - one on behalf of a younger sibling, one from his mother, and two for a female Saugus High student.

He has been arrested several times - in August he arrested on accusations of dragging a woman with his car.
