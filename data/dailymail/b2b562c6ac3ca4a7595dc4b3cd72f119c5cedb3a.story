Graeme McDowell will take a glorious trip down memory lane next week to ensure he is in the right frame of mind for this year’s Ryder Cup at Gleneagles.

The 35-year-old Northern Irishman has added the Wales Open at Celtic Manor to his schedule and so will warm up for this year’s match at the venue where he holed the winning putt in 2010.

‘I’ve got so many happy memories there,’ he said. ‘I also won the Wales Open at Celtic Manor in 2010 as well as enjoying my time at the Ryder Cup, so it will certainly get the juices flowing a bit. 

Happy return: McDowell sealed a home win for Europe at Celtic Manor in 2010 and will play there again

Getting into the swing: McDowell hopes to find his best form at the course ahead of Gleneagles

'My thinking is that I want to know the state of my game. I don’t want to take a week off and be thinking: “What if?” I want to be sharp because you know by Tuesday at Gleneagles you are playing for your place in the starting line-up.’

McDowell made it into the side via automatic qualifying by the skin of his teeth over Stephen Gallacher to create a record he is justifiably proud about.

‘I’m the only man to play in the last four Ryder Cups without needing a wildcard pick, so I will give myself a pat on the back for that,’ he said. 

‘It certainly makes a difference to make it off my own efforts, even if the margin was tiny. There’s more pressure if you’re a wildcard, although it never seems to do Ian Poulter any harm!

‘But it has been an amazing qualifying period for me, for so many reasons. Off the course, I got married when it started last September and it has ended with me becoming a parent. I won the French Open in July and now I have got the Ryder Cup so it has been a brilliant summer.’

Great year: McDowell's marriage and first child have added to Ryder Cup qualification in a good year

McDowell watched Gallacher’s valiant effort to pip him for the last automatic spot at the Italian Open last week with mixed emotions. ‘I thought with four or five holes to go Stevie was going to make it and I felt for him when he didn’t,’ he said. 

‘I was so pleased when he got a pick. It would have been devastating to get so close and not make the team, and particularly given it is in Scotland. How special to play in a Ryder Cup in your home country? Not many players get to experience that. I know I won’t.’

McDowell took last week off for the birth of his first child and mum Kristin and daughter Vale are doing well.

Understandably, he had the air of a distracted man for the first two rounds of the BMW Championship here and was well down the field at halfway. ‘I guess it’s not too surprising I’ve not been at the races and it has been one long physical letdown,’ he said.

With little chance now of qualifying for the FedEx Cup finale in Atlanta that starts on Thursday, McDowell will seek to recapture his form in Wales the following week. As for the Ryder Cup, he could not help but reflect he has packed an awful lot into his three appearances to date.

‘I’ve certainly ridden that Ryder Cup rollercoaster,’ he smiled. ‘I have experienced all the emotions the contest can throw up. I’ve hit the first and last shot, I’ve won on both sides of the Atlantic, and I’ve been on a losing side.’

Super Macs: McDowell and McIlroy celebrate after Medinah and will play together again at Gleneagles

McDowell wasn’t at his formidable match play best and contributed little to the Medinah miracle in 2012 but is determined things will be different this time. 

‘I’m ready to go to Gleneagles and enjoy it, and that’s not always the case with the Ryder Cup,’ he said. ‘You can get too wrapped up with the pressure. I didn’t enjoy it last time because I was washed up mentally, having played too much in the build-up.’

Europe captain Paul McGinley told Sportsmail in July we will see the celebrated pairing of G-Mac and ‘Wee Mac’ at some point, even if the friendship of McDowell and Rory McIIroy has been strained for the past year. 

McIlroy has been involved in an ugly legal wrangle with his former management group Horizon Sports, who also look after McDowell, and the latter has felt caught in the middle.

McDowell himself will now be leaving Horizon at the end of the year, albeit on more amicable terms, and it would come as no surprise if he and Rory start rebuilding bridges.

And where better to start than Gleneagles, reviving their awesome combination of old and cutting down some Americans. That would help any friendship along, wouldn’t it?
