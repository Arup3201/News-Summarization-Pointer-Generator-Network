To catch a predator: 31-year-old Malik Taylor resigned from his position at a Manhattan high school in May after it was revealed he slept with four students

A former dean at a New York City High School, slept with four students, sexually harassed another four, and sent them all text messages and calls from his wife's cellphone.

31-year-old Malik Taylor was a 'community adviser' and dean at the Business of Sports School in Manhattan.

Taylor resigned from his position on May 28, after one of the students he slept with reported his behavior, prompting a school district investigation.

The school was made aware of his behavior when the 19-year-old student told another teacher, Tarawhona Bellevue, about the relationship and that she believed Taylor was in a relationship with one other student.

But Taylor's abuses of power went further than two students. According to a report published by the Special Commissioner of Investigation, Taylor slept with four students and further harassed another four students during his one year at the school.

One of the students was so troubled by her affair with the dean that she ran away. Others had to deal with sexual comments directed at them in the school hallway like 'Why do you have such a bigÂ  breasts?'

He kept in contact with the students using his wife's cell phone and even admitted to having intercourse with two of the students in empty classrooms after school.

The student who reported the crime said that soon after she met Taylor, the month he was started at the school, he began making jokes about her and lewd comments about her buttocks.

He regularly told her that her 'ass is ridiculous' and mentioned his daughter - but she believed he was unmarried.

One day while in the cafeteria, he grabbed her buttocks, and when she confronted him he said 'I just had to.'

Somehow he got her phone number and started texting her from his wife's phone, asking the girl to give him a chance.

She relented and in February 2013, he drove her into Manhattan where they ate gyros.

Afterwards he asked her to go to a motel ad she consented.

According to the report 'she agreed because Taylor basically had beaten her down over the months with requests to be intimate with her.'

They would have sex on one other occasion, three weeks later at a downtown Manhattan motel. Taylor did not wear protection either time.

While two of the other girls he had sex with were 17 (the age of consent in New York) one was not.

Resigned: After finding out that one of the students he had sex with reported him to school administrators, Taylor resigned. He had worked at Business of Sports school for one year

He had sex with a 16-year-old about five times, and admittedly twice in a classroom after school. When he was interviewed in June by investigators, he said he knew the student was 16 when he had intercourse with her.

And those weren't the only times he had trysts in empty classrooms. He said he had sex twice in an empty classroom with one 17-year-old student. This student believed they were in an exclusive relationship when he 'started talking to her in a a more romantic way.'

The final student he had sex with is the most mysterious. The 16-year-old student told investigators that this other student 'really had feelings for him' and that he once asked her if she wanted to have a threesome with the 16-year-old, but she declined.

According to the student who first reported Taylor, something happened between the fourth student and Taylor that caused her to be angry, and the girl ran away.

Investigators tried to contact this mystery fourth student, but were unsuccessful.

Taylor was less successful wooing four other students.

One 17-year-old student described Taylor once approaching her on the school elevator and asking her 'You know how I recognize you?' and then pointing to her buttocks.

She said that comment made her feel 'scared' of Taylor.

He also told her that he would like to date her and that made her feel 'disgusted and not safe.'

One of her friends said that Taylor asked the student why her butt was so big in the hallway on several occasions, and once turned his harassment to her asking 'Why do you have such big breasts?'

Trysts: Taylor took one of the students to the Capri Motel in the Bronx, according to the report

He once got another student out of class and told her to meet him at the local McDonald's. She says at the restaurant he asked her to get marijuana and meet him at his house. She took his number but did not get the marijuana or meet up with him. Taylor denies asking her over to his house.

When interviewed, Taylor said the girl had a drug problem and he did not ask her to his house.

On another occasion he told the same student that he was going to 'f*** the s*** out of' her and she told him she didn't want to have sex with him.

Taylor asked if he could 'at least suck on her boobs?'

He then told her not to tell anyone about her conversation, because he knew where she lived. She wasn't sure if that was a threat since he was laughing.

He asked another student to walk down the stairs in front of him so he could see her 'a** shake' and held the door open for her saying 'there's not enough room for me and your big a**.'

The New York Post reports that Taylor is currently in Georgia visiting relatives.

The school district has referred the case to both the Manhattan and Brooklyn District Attorney's Offices.
