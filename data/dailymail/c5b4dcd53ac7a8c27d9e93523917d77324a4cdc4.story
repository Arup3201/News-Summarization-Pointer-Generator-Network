The funeral of an 18-year-old college freshman was held today as her boyfriend appeared in court charged with her murder.

Family, friends and fellow students packed the church in New Hartford on Thursday to remember the short life of Alexandra Kogut. Her family urged mourners to 'celebrate her love and her life, rather than remember the few tragic moments that took her from us'.

The teenager was discovered beaten to death in her dorm room last Saturday at the State University of New York College at Brockport, near Rochester, New York.

Tragic: The funeral of Alexandra Kogut, 18, was held today in her hometown of New Hartford while her boyfriend appeared in court charged with her murder

Tributes: Kelly Kogut and Victor Gerace, the godmother and godfather of Alexandra Kogut, read a statement at her funeral service at St John the Evangelist Church

Purple ribbons drawing attention to 
domestic violence draped the trees outside St John the Evangelist Church 
on Thursday while hundreds of people attended the funeral.

Relatives of Miss Kogut said the community support, which has been evident in vigils, signs and an outpouring of purple, has sustained them.

'Every purple blouse, ribbon, Facebook post, balloon and even the tiniest purple painted fingernail reminds us of our dear Alex,' read a funeral program note signed by the Kogut family.

Miss Kogut's boyfriend Clayton Whittemore, also from New Hartford, was due to appear in Sweden Town Court on Thursday.

The 21-year-old had pleaded not guilty to an initial charge of second-degree murder. Monroe County prosecutors said a grand jury voted to indict Whittemore but formal charges have not yet been decided.

Members of the New Hartford High School swim team, which Kogut captained
before graduating in June, wiped tears away as they entered the church 
behind the casket.

The Reverend Paul Drobin said that if Kogut were there, she would tell those gathered: 'Care for each other, love one another as I have loved you.'

A photograph of the young woman's face was displayed in front of the church as her godparents, Victor Gerace and Kelly Kogut, wept and spoke on behalf of her parents, The Utica Observer-Dispatch reported.

'We are comforted by knowing Alex was at a very good time in her life – so happy and optimistic – because some people never achieve the happiness she had,' Mr Gerace read from their statement.

In remembrance: Family and friends packed the church for the funeral service of Miss Kogut

'Our message to you today is please don't let anger cloud your memories of Alex,' Kelly Kogut read.

'It's very important to us that you 
do not harbor any hatred. Our hope is that you will celebrate her love 
and her life, rather than remember the few tragic moments that took her 
from us.'

Miss Kogut was one month into her 
first year at college, majoring in communications, when authorities say 
she was killed during a visit by Whittemore, an accounting student at 
Utica College.

Whittemore told state troopers he intentionally killed Kogut, according to a criminal complaint. No motive was given.

Hours before Miss Kogut was brutally 
beaten to death in her dorm room, she 
wrote a final, chilling final tweet: 'Should have known.'

The
teenager had been carrying on a long distance relationship with 
Whittemore, 21, after she went to school 150 miles away from their 
hometown of New Hartford.

Police say Whittemore admitted to battering his girlfriend, whom he had been dating for about a year, after he was arrested at a rest stop between Brockport and New Hartford.

The couple exchanged dozens of messages with each other over Twitter. Most were 
playful and affectionate.

'So excited for @Whittemore21 to come
to Brockport Saturday and bring me half moons,' she tweeted to her 
boyfriend in early September.

'Not if I eat them all first yummm,' Whittemore responded.

'You better not eat my half moons or tomato pie!!!!' was her retort. 'Half moon' is another name for black and white cookies.

Kogut and Whittemore lived in New 
Hartford, in central New York about two and a half hours east of 
Brockport, and attended the same high school.

Kogut's childhood friend Mary Kate 
Heaton said the two had appeared 'perfectly content' in the 
relationship, which began last year.

'I know she loved him a lot,' Ms Heaton said earlier this week.

Heaton and Kogut, along with their 
mothers, had taken a trip to New York City just before heading off to 
college, Heaton said. Kogut gave no hint of trouble as the group shopped
and saw 'Phantom of the Opera' on Broadway in New York City, she said.

'She was texting him throughout the whole trip,' Heaton said.

Brutal death: Alexandra Kogut was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend Clayton Whittemore in her NY college dorm room

Caught: Clayton Whittemore (left) has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder

Kogut's body was found early Saturday
in her dorm at the State University of New York campus after her mother
called them concerned because she couldn't reach her, Monroe County 
sheriff's spokesman John Helfer said.

Whittemore, a student at Utica 
College near his hometown, was arrested at a Thruway rest stop near 
Syracuse, 100 miles east, about an hour later.

The cause of death was ruled blunt 
force trauma, Helfer said, but he declined to say whether a weapon was 
used.

Her injuries were extensive and mostly focused on her upper body, 
the campus police chief said.

Whittemore pleaded not guilty last weekend to a second-degree murder charge and is being held without bail in Monroe 
County Jail.

Telephone messages left at his family's New Hartford home 
and at his public defender's office weren't immediately returned Monday.

On the run: Though he apparently confessed to police when they found him, that happened at a highway rest stop more than 100 miles away from the dorm room where the young woman's body was found

School shock: Whittemore is not enrolled at SUNY Brockport, but his girlfriend was a student at the school

Whittemore lives in his hometown of New Hartford and was a promising hockey star during high school. He was featured as an 'Athlete of the Week' by WKTV Utica in 2010.

He is being held under the custody of the Monroe County Sheriff and has yet to be issued bail.

'It's tragic when anyone loses their life,' campus police chief Robert Kehoe told ABC affiliate WHAM.

'When a young lady who's a college student and apparently in a safe environment, is brutally murdered as this young lady was, it's certainly a tragedy for her family and friends and the entire Brockport college community.'
