Heavy drinking is in sharp decline, according to a large-scale survey.

Numbers of people who drink every day of the week have fallen by a third since the 1990s, it was found.

The biggest drinkers in the country are the middle-aged and higher-earners, the state-backed survey said.

There was a sharp fall in the proportion of people who said they had drunk alcohol on five or more days in the previous week

And despite the apparent prevalence 
of teenage binge-drinking, the findings show that drinking is going out 
of fashion among the young.

The results come from the General 
Lifestyle Survey drawn up by the Office for National Statistics from 
interviews with 15,000 people.

More than half of women under 50 are now unmarried, new figures show.

The Office for National Statistics said that over the last 30 years the proportion of women who were married has fallen by a third while the proportion cohabiting has tripled.

Since 1979, the proportion of women aged 
18-49 who were married fell from 74per cent to 47 per cent in 
2011.

Over the same period the proportion of couples cohabiting trebled from 11 per cent to 34 per cent. One in five women over 45 do not have children.

The proportion of one-parent households has also tripled, and the proportion of families with only one child increased by around a third.

In 1973 just two per cent of 25-44-year-olds lived alone but by 2011 it had soared to 10 per cent.

They suggest that heavy alcohol 
consumption is now following smoking as a social and personal habit that
 is increasingly uncommon among the young.

Instead it is most typically found among those who developed a taste for drink years ago.

Declining heavy drinking will further
 undermine David Cameron’s scheme to introduce minimum pricing on 
alcohol bought in supermarkets.

The Prime Minister believes that 
blocking sales of cheap alcohol with minimum prices, possible 50 pence a
 unit, would tackle alcoholism, violence and anti-social behaviour, and 
save the NHS large sums.

But the ONS findings back the 
majority of the Cabinet who have opposed the pricing plan on the grounds
 that it would punish lower income people who drink moderately.

Yesterday’s survey says that people in routine jobs and on low incomes drink less alcohol – as do the unemployed.

The survey said that in 1998 some 23 per cent of men and 13 per cent of women were drinking on five or more days every week.

By 2011, that had dropped to 16 per 
cent of men and 9 per cent of women. It added that the people most 
likely to drink five days or more a week were those over 45, and that 
younger people drink less.

There was a major drop in 
binge-drinking among men under 24. In 2005, nearly half, 46 per cent, 
reported drinking more than four units of alcohol on their heaviest 
drinking day in the week before they were interviewed.

Just half of 16-24-year-olds reported drinking in a week, down from 60 per cent in 2005

Four units is the equivalent of two pints of beer, two medium glasses of wine, or four pub measures of spirits.

By 2011, fewer than a third of men in that age group – 32 per cent – were drinking at that level.

The ONS said there was a similar downward trend in the proportions of women exceeding three units.

The survey said highest levels of 
regular drinking were among managers and professionals, and lowest 
levels among those whose work was described as routine or manual.

Similarly, the wealthier the household, the more likely the people in it to drink.

Three-quarters of men with jobs drank
 alcohol in the week before they were interviewed, but fewer than half 
of those who were unemployed or workless had drunk.

The calorie count of alcoholic drinks could be displayed in pubs and shops under plans to warn people about how fattening booze can be

It was also found that 67 per cent of
 men and 54 per cent of women had a drink in the week before their 
interview in England, compared with 56 per cent and 48 per cent in 
Scotland.

Almost one in ten pregnant women continue to drink during pregnancy, the General Lifestyle Survey found.

The survey also noted that the number of people who smoke has gone down from 45 per cent in 1974 to 20 per cent in 2011.

Elaine Hindal, of the Drinkaware 
pressure group, said: ‘On the surface, today’s figures seem to suggest 
we’re all drinking less, but if you take a closer look, there’s still 
cause for concern. Of regular drinkers, more than half report drinking 
over the guidelines, and a quarter are drinking to binge-drinking 
levels.’
