Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, who has revealed he drew on his own experience for a recent storyline in the show 

He captivates audiences with his depiction of 1920’s upper-class society, taking in the rules and etiquette of the time and creating characters who struggle to live by them.

But Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has revealed that he drew on his own experience for his latest storyline for the show set in the roaring 1920s.

Lord Fellowes said he used an episode of romantic rejection when he was a young man to create a plot for the show’s fifth series.

His character Lady Rose, played by actress Lily James, was torn between her love interest, the son of Jewish immigrants and her family who do not approve of him.

The 65-year-old told the New York Times that he too was left feeling insecure after he was rejected by one of his first loves because of his religion.

'I felt it as a Catholic when I was young. One of my first girlfriends was from a fairly senior Jewish family', he said. 

'They were a very nice family – I’m still friendly, actually, with the girl and her brother.

'But her parents wanted a Jewish husband. 

'And it’s a very strange feeling when you realise that people don’t like you because of what you are.’

He also told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz that the rejection was 'sort of my first experience of not being desirable.' 

He added: 'They certainly didn’t want a Catholic in the family.

‘People always think the prejudice is one-way, but it can be two ways. I wanted to use that in the show.’

He said the 1920s was a time when: ‘People didn’t mind if you came to their house or you shot their pheasants, you ate their dinners or went to their daughter’s dances.

'But, my God, they didn’t want you to marry her.’

Lord Fellowes refused to identify the woman who spurned him, but has said she belongs to one of the 'great Jewish families'.

In Downton Abbey, the character Lady Rose, played by Lily James, right, was torn between her love interest, Atticus, the son of Jewish immigrants played by Matt Barber, and her family who do not approve of him

He has now been married to his wife Emma Kitchener for 25 years.

A sixth series of Downton Abbey has been commissioned and goes into production later this year.

However, he has hinted that the series may be the last saying 'it is not going to go on forever'.

The screenwriter admits there is no way he could continue to write it while working on his next major project, The Gilded Age. 

He was commissioned almost a year ago by US television network NBC to write the programme, which has been dubbed the American version of of the ITV1 show.

A sixth series of Downton Abbey has been commissioned by ITV and goes into production later this year but Lord Fellowes has hinted this  series may be the last

The Gilded Age will chart 'the dizzying, brilliant ascents and calamitous falls' of New York society in late 19th century.

It is being billed by NBC as ‘an epic tale of the princes of the American Renaissance and the vast fortunes made - and spent - in late 19th- century New York’.

'This was a vivid time in America,' said Lord Fellowes. 'There was record-breaking ostentation and savage rivalry, in a time when money was king.'
