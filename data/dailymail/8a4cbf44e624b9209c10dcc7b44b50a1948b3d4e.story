A van driver was handed a £200 fine for not displaying a No Smoking sticker on his new vehicle four times more than if he'd been caught actually puffing at the wheel.

Freddie Beasley, 28, from Cleankill Environmental Services had just picked up the brand new van  from a garage when he was pulled over in a joint police and council operation to clamp down on 'dodgy vehicles.

Mr Beasley, who does not smoke, was warned that lighting up in company 
vehicles was illegal and that he would have been fined £50 if he had 
been caught taking a drag behind the wheel.

Fuming: Company boss Paul Bates with the £200 fine handed to one of his drivers for not displaying a no smoking sign on a brand new vehicle

Clipboard-wielding
council officers then, however, spotted that he didn't had a 'no 
smoking' sticker on his gleaming van and he was given an on-the-spot 
fine of £200.

Mr Beasley tried to explain that he had only just picked the new van up from a workshop where workers had painted the Cleankill logo on the side and that he was driving it back to the firm's HQ in Surrey.

The law states that any 'company 
vehicle' must have a no smoking sign - meaning that if he had been in 
the van with no logo he wouldn't have been fined as it would have been 
considered a 'personal van'.

Yesterday Mr Beasley's boss Paul Bates said he was 'fuming' at the fine.

He
said: 'Let this be a warning to anybody that drives a company van...we 
have just been fined £200 for not displaying a no smoking sign in one of
our vans.

Offence: Mr Beasley had failed to display a no-smoking sign in the brand new van

'All our vans normally have them, but this was a new van we have only just had sign written, and was driven by somebody who doesn't smoke - but try explaining that to Haringey Council!

'The irony is that if our technician had been smoking he would have been fined four time less, just £50.

'There was no warning or caution - it is absolutely ridiculous and at a time when small business like ours are having a tough time financially.'

The operation - run by Haringey Council, police and bailiffs - was called 'Operation Stop It' and was aimed at cracking down on 'unlicensed waste carriers' - fly-tippers - and other vehicles guilty of 'environmental crime'.

Bosses at Haringey Council said that 95 vehicles were stopped outside the Wickes DIY store in Haringey last Friday.

Among those stopped included six people driving vehicles in such a bad state they were seized by police, one man arrested for possessing drugs, one for stealing a disabled badge and several fly-tippers.

They also doled out 12 £200 fines for not displaying 'no smoking signs' in company vehicles and two £50 fines to people caught smoking inside company vans.

Cllr Nilgun Canver, Cabinet Member for the Environment at Haringey Council, said: 'We will continue to work closely with our partners in the police and the courts to tackle illegal activity around vehicles, especially looking out for unlicensed waste carriers that are responsible for so much dumping in our borough.

'We will continue to protect those workers who are forced to sit in smoke polluted environments because their employers don't comply with the law which bans smoke in company vehicles.'
