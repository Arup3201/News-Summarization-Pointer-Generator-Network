Canada’s Milos Raonic celebrated his qualification for this month’s season-end finale in London by defeating Tomas Berdych on Saturday to make the final of Paris Masters.

The 23-year-old from Toronto followed up his victory over Roger Federer on Friday by overcoming the Czech 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, thus registering back-to-back wins over a top-five player for the first time in his career.

He will need to beat another top player, world No 1 Novak Djokovic, if he is to win the final Masters event of the year ahead of the Barclays World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena that begin a week on Sunday.

Djokovic later comfortably overcame Japan’s Kei Nishikori 6-2, 6-3 after the Serb had already given Andy Murray a free weekend by defeating him on Friday evening. 

The world No 1 is tightening his grip on that position, faced with the challenge from Federer.

Late on Friday Nishikori overcame Spain’s David Ferrer in the last quarter-final, and that finally ended all the mathematical calculations that had dominated the week in the French capital. 

Nishikori reaching the last four meant that he had qualified for the elite eight-man field in London along with Raonic, thus completing the line-up that will play for bumper prize money and points starting this time next week.

Djokovic's win takes him one step closer to becoming the first player to retain the Paris Masters

Being in the top nine was required to make the World Tour Finals this year, as Rafael Nadal is absent having an operation on his appendix.

British No 2 James Ward was defeated 6-3, 7-6 by top seed Robin Haase in the semi-final of the Challenger on Reunion Island, although his progress has given him the chance of joining Andy Murray in the world’s top 100.

The Londoner will be up to around 111 in Monday’s rankings and he is within touching distance of gaining direct entry to the Australian Open without having to qualify.
