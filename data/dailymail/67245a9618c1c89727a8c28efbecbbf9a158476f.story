Debt-ridden: Shelley MacKenney racked up £20,000k on credit cards and overdrafts and owed money to loan sharks

After racking up £20k in debt by the age of 22, a desperate young woman felt giving up her life and living on the streets was her only option.

So one day in 2002, Shelley MacKenney caught the first coach she found leaving London and didn't look back.

She left behind her grandmother, who had raised her in South London after her mother walked out on her at the age of three.

Shelley's grandfather, father and grandmother were all involved at various stages of their life in criminal activity, forcing Shelley to grow up fast and become responsible for paying the bills and mortgage legally.

She got a job at a bank but the seemingly readily available money at her fingertips led to her spiraling into debt.

‘I was available to everything on offer – cards, loans, overdrafts – and because I worked in the bank and had such good credit, more and more of them just kept on coming through my door and were never questioned,’ Shelley said when she appeared on yesterday's This Morning.

'Debt doesn’t just happen overnight. At first I was paying them all off but eventually, over time, the debts grew.'

She showered her friends and family with presents and was oblivious to her outgoings.

'I took Nan shopping and bought takeaways for the whole family and spent hundreds of pounds on groceries - I always wanted to see the cupboards full of food because they weren't when I was younger,' she writes in a book of her experiences, called Missing.

'I wanted my family to have everything: my family who had known nothing but hardship, persecution and prosecution, who'd had nothing before. Now they could have everything and I'd pay for it. I was trying to prove that I could be useful.'

But three years of overspending led to £200,000 of debt. 'By now I was using one credit card to pay off another,' she writes. She added that once the credit cards and overdrafts were maxed out, she had to seek other means to fuel her spending, going to dangerous loan sharks.

She sank into depression and shopping became her only release and escapism - adding further to her debt.

Escape: Shelley revealed on This Morning how she felt her only option was to disappear

With the loan sharks starting to threaten her with violence if she didn't pay them back, she resorted to stealling £1,000 from the bank where she worked.

Guilt-ridden, she later confessed and lost her job, which caused her to sink deeper into depression. She even considered taking her own life. 'I didn't want to be alive anymore,' she confessed to  Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning.

It was then Shelley decided to flee. She went to Victoria coach station, asked for a ticket to 'anywhere,' and ended up in Birmingham.

Once there, Shelley became a missing person. She was so ashamed by her debts and overcome with depression – she wanted to forget her identity altogether.

'It's easy to disappear initially, but you have to work to stay under the radar,' she explained on This Morning. 'Every part of society is trying to bring you back in. You have a NI number. You have to become a non-person.'

Turned her life around: Now she's a proud mother and published author

For several months, Shelley spent time on the streets or in hostels, resorting to drastic measures to get by including conning men out of money by pretending to be interested in them.

All this time, her grandmother had no idea what had become of her and Shelley didn't get in touch. She moved from place to place making it impossible for her to be tracked down.

In trying to explain how she could leave her grandmother without even a note to explain her absence, Shelley says: 'I was so emotionally distraught and had gone through all the emotions you can think of before I left. By the time I did leave it was like I was numb. It was like the person before was dead. I couldn't feel anything anymore.'

Shelley's memoir, Missing, published by Penguin, recounts her time living on the streets and in shelters and the dangers she encountered.

She eventually changed her name by deed poll using legal aid and this enabled her to start signing on, open a bank account and get part-time work without fear of being discovered for who she really was.

It was becoming a mother that finally made Shelley realise she couldn't keep running away from her old life.

'I didn't want to live on the streets anymore,' she says. 'I wanted her to have a proper upbringing,' she said of her daughter, Alyssia, who she fell pregnant with after a brief relationship with a man she met in a pub.

Shelley went to a doctor and asked for help. They promptly put her in for counselling and she was supported by the Salvation Army. Eventually, she was ready to be reunited with her nan and her father and got back in touch with them. She now regrets running away from them for so long.

She writes in her book: 'I need to say sorry to the people I walked away from. I can only imagine how they must have felt.'

Now age 34 and a proud mother settled in Birmingham, Shelley now earns a living through book writing. She first helped her grandmother publish her story, Borstal Girl, and has now released her own memoir.

She hopes sharing her story can help others. She advises people who get into debt to seek help and speak out rather than running away like she did.

'Always talk about what's gong on inside you. Don't keep it to yourself. I know it's hard and sometimes more difficult to talk to people you know than a stranger. But you are never alone, like I thought I was.'

Shelley's book, Missing, was published this week to coincide with International Missing Children's Day, www.missingpeople.org.uk
