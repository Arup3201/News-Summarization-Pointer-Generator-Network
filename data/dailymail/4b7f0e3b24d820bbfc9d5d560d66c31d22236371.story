In the second half of last year, Twitter saw a dramatic rise in the number of governments  asking for content to be removed from the site.

An interactive map based on the site's latest transparency report shows Turkey filed 477 requests between July and December - an increase of more than 150 per cent compared to the first six months of 2014.

Russia and Germany followed with 91 and 43 removal requests respectively, and overall requests for removal of material were up 40 per cent globally. 

An interactive map (grab pictured) plots the number of content removal requests from global governments, and how the number of these requests has changed since January 2012. The figures are taken from the site's annual transparency report

The map also reveals that Turkey filed more than five times the number of content removal requests  than any other country.

Twitter created its first annual transparency report in 2012 and the reports are designed to 'shine a light on government requests for customers’ information.'

The site added: 'Providing this insight is simply the right thing to do, especially in an age of increasing concerns about government surveillance.'

Turkish requests predominantly focused around accusations of
violation of personal rights and defamation of private citizens
and government officials.

The figures are likely to reinforce fears of a crackdown on internet freedom in the NATO state where
President Tayyip Erdogan has said he is determined to stamp out
what he sees as illegal online activities.

For example, Turkey temporarily blocked Twitter and YouTube in the run-up
to local elections last March. 

This block came after audio recordings
purportedly showing corruption in President Erdogan's inner circle were
leaked online. The decision caused a public uproar and
drew international criticism.

'We filed court objections in response to over 70 per cent of
the Turkish court orders we received, winning around 5 per cent
of our appeals,' Twitter said, adding that 15 per cent of
its objections were still pending with the courts.

In Russia, requests ranged from promotion of illegal drugs to attempts to suppress non-violent demonstrations. 

'While we had a compliance rate of 13 per cent, we denied several requests to silence popular critics of the Russian government and other demands to limit speech about non-violent demonstrations in Ukraine' continued the report. 

Most German requests dealt with complaints of alleged hateful and discriminatory content, resulting in 37 per cent compliance. 

The United States (pictured) was in fifth place, with a 29 per cent increase in requests, but none of the 32 attempts were withheld. The UK was in seventh place with 22 requests for removal, all of which were denied. Compliance rates globally increased 8 per cent

The highest compliance rates were in France where 43 per cent of the 35 requests were withheld.  

Australia, Colombia, Cyprus, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Norway, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela were among the countries that didn't file any removal requests in the second half of last year.  

Compliance rates globally increased 8 per cent and all of the requests that were withheld are publicly available online at Chilling Effects. 

'Providing this level of transparency is not without its complications and sometimes means we get tough questions and criticism about our decisions,' concluded the report.

'However, this candid feedback helps us to be evermore thoughtful about our policies and decisions regarding content and compliance as we navigate complex, diverse legal regimes around the world. 

'As more companies consider publishing or expanding their own reports, we strongly encourage them to join us and our peers at Google, Vimeo, WordPress and Wikimedia in publishing government removal demands. 

'The global community deserves this level of transparency from its governments and its service providers.'
