They are the immortal words that have been etched in Australian political history.

With a booming voice, Gough Whitlam stood on the steps of old parliament house in Canberra in 1975 and declared: 'Well may we say 'God save the Queen', because nothing will save the Governor-General.'

He had just been informed of the news he was to become the first and only prime minister of Australia to be sacked.

Gough Whitlam stood on the steps of old parliament house in Canberra in 1975 and declared: 'Well may we say 'God save the Queen', because nothing will save the Governor-General.'

But little did he know his comments directed towards Governor-General John Kerr would become as equally as famous as his dismissal.

Whitlam, who passed away at the age of 98 on Tuesday, will be remembered for his sweeping changes as a Prime Minister but also his sharp tongue and quick wit in and out of Australia politics.

Following his dismissal on November 11, 1975, Whitlam infamously took aim at those he held responsible. 

'The proclamation which you have just heard read was counter-signed by Malcolm Fraser who will undoubtedly go down in Australia's history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr's cur... Maintain your rage and enthusiasm through the campaign for the election now to be held,' he said. 

'It is the first time the burglar has been appointed as caretaker.'

'Comrades, did I go too far?' Whitlam, who once said 'the fun is where I am!' quipped to his Labor colleagues following his rant.

Whitlam, who passed away at the age of 98 on Tuesday, will be remembered for his sweeping changes as a Prime Minister but also his most memorable commentary in and out of Australia politics

Following his dismissal on November 11, 1975, Whitlam infamously took aim at those he held responsible by labelling the Governor-General's actions as 'Kerr's cur'

One of his most famous sledges of all time was directed towards High Court Chief Justice Garfield Barwick when he took great care in calling him a 'truculent runt'.

Barwick had advised Governor-General Sir John Kerr on the legality of dismissing Whitlam in 1975. 

So naturally, when Whitlam met West Indian cricketer, Sir Garfield Sobers, he told him: 'You’re the one Sir Garfield I will shake hands with'.

On his campaign trail, Whitlam once hit out at a rowdy man who heckled him for his opinion on abortion at a public meeting.

'Let me make quite clear that I am for abortion and, in your case Sir, we should make it retrospective,' he said.

He also took aim at Sir Winton Turbull when the rural MP shouted: 'I am a Country member'. Whitlam quickly responded with 'I remember', which earned an applause from both sides of the house. 

'He could not understand why, for the first time in all the years he had been speaking in the House, there was instant and loud applause from both sides,' Whitlam later elaborated. 

One of his most famous sledges during his time in parliament was directed towards Garfield Barwick when he took great care in calling him a 'truculent runt'

When Whitlam was asked by a reporter in 1975 what the Labor government would do if Indonesia invaded East Timor, he responded: 'We would do absolutely nothing. Now that's a blunt, truthful answer'. Three days later East Timor was invaded.  

When thousands of Vietnamese refugees sought refuge in Australia after Saigon was taken over by northern Vietnamese troops in 1975, Whitlam reportedly declared: 'I'm not having hundreds of f***ing Vietnamese Balts coming into this country with their religious and political hatreds against us!'  

In August 1975, Whitlam gave the Gurindji people at Wattie Creek in the Northern Territory title deeds to their traditional lands. 

'Vincent Lingiari, I solemnly hand to you these deeds as proof, in Australian law, that these lands belong to the Gurindji people and I put into your hands this piece of the earth itself as a sign that we restore them to you and your children forever'.

Whitlam abolished the last remnants of the White Australia Policy during his three year term and later said: 'I was profoundly embarrassed by (the policy) and I did all I could to change it'

His comments still circulate today in the political arena with Prime Minister Tony Abbott comparing former Labor PM Kevin Rudd to the late Whitlam

He also abolished the last remnants of the White Australia Policy during his three year term and later said: 'I was profoundly embarrassed by (The White Australia Policy) and I did all I could to change it.'

In a speech at the centenary of the federal ALP caucus in 2001, Whitlam joked about his days as prime minister. 

'The Caucus I joined in 1953 had as many Boer War veterans as men who had seen active service in World War II, three from each. The Ministry appointed on 5 December 1972 was composed entirely of ex-servicemen: Lance Barnard and me,' he said. 

Whitlam spoke of his dismissal regularly in the years to follow that fateful day in 1975 and he also referred to having 'more influence now than when I had the power'

'A conservative government survives essentially by dampening expectations and subduing hopes. Conservatism is basically pessimistic, reformism is basically optimistic,' he once said of the Liberal party.  

His comments still circulate today in the political arena with Prime Minister Tony Abbott comparing former Labor PM Kevin Rudd to the late Whitlam. 

'The punters know that the horse named Morality rarely gets past the post, whereas the nag named Self-interest always runs a good race,' Whitlam said. 

But his comments following politics have been as equally as memorable. 

Whitlam spoke of his dismissal regularly in the years to follow that fateful day in 1975. 

In his 1997 book he said: 'If I begin my book with a review of the coup, it is only to show that my abiding interests for Australia did not end with it. They shall end only with a long and fortunate life.'

He also referred to having 'more influence now than when I had the power'.
