Police say it looks like something may have 'spooked' a young couple who suddenly disappeared with their four-month-old baby three weeks ago leaving their personal belongings behind.

It appears that Timothy Medsker, 33, wife Sabrina, 34, and baby son Joshua, who were last seen on February 12, left their Michigan home in their silver Ford pick-up.  

The couple from the small town of Petoskey have apparently abandoned their successful cleaning business and left in the middle of packing leaving clothing, computers, food and paperwork behind.

'This is 100 percent out of character and very concerning,' Kelly Manthei, Mr Medsker's sister, told ABC News.

Although the new parents have not been 
in contact with anyone they know, police said there was no evidence of foul play. 

'Anytime we have a missing person or someone who can't be contacted usually in a small town like this, a few phone calls and we know where there at.

'But obviously now almost going on three weeks this is not the case,' Petoskey Detective David Schultz.told ABC News.

Police have searched the home a 
second time this week and took computers and personal papers  for clues 
about what happened to the family.

'All
of their personal belongings were there including clothing, computers, 
food, paperwork – it looked like something spooked them,' added Schultz.

February 23 after being contacted by concerned customers. The Medskers,
who were described as 'very private', reportedly have family in 
Orlando, Florida.

'We love you and we love Joshua. Please just call somebody or write or email. Please let us know you guys are ok, we're so worried about you.'

The town of Petoskey has a population of around 6,000 and sits on the northeast shore of Lake Michigan.

Mr Calabrese told The Orlando Sentinel that: 'It appears the family left the Petoskey area by choice, however, family members and friends are requesting the public's help in locating them.'

The family also has connections in Chicago and Gary, Indiana. At one time, the Medskeys may have lived in Arizona or Florida.
