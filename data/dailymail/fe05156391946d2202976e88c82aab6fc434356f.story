Faced with a school project on space, Lucas Whiteley boldly went where few four-year-olds have gone before . . . and asked the big boys at NASA for help.

With a little help from his dad, the primary school pupil sent a video of himself asking three questions to the US space agency’s website.

To his delight, Lucas received an email with a ten-minute video made for him by research engineer Ted Garbeff of NASA’s Ames Research Center.Scroll down for video

That's out of this world! Lucas Whiteley, pictured with his father James, received a personal response to his space-related questions from the experts at NASA

Mr
 Garbeff, whose work in experimental fluid physics includes studying the
 wake of space capsules, answered the questions and gave a virtual tour 
of the base in Mountain View, California.

Teachers at Lucas’s primary school in Wrenthorpe, West Yorkshire, were so impressed they played it in assembly.

Lucas’s
 father James Whiteley, 37, an app designer, said: ‘When I was a kid I 
wrote to NASA and got a brochure, so I thought we might be lucky if we 
sent a video of Lucas asking questions.

‘What we got back three 
weeks later was amazing. Obviously Ted has thought about his audience 
and gone to a lot of trouble just for them.

At your service: NASA engineer Ted Garbeff responded with a 10-minute video answering all four-year-old Lucas's questions

Guided tour: Ted Garbeff gave a virtual tour round his base in California and answered little Lucas's questions

Whoooosh! The NASA engineer used models of his rockets to help answer the questions for Lucas's school project

Chuffed: Father James was over the moon, saying it had been 'the most amazing response to my son's questions'

‘When I sat down to watch it with Lucas he had a big smile on his face.

‘Ted is a fantastic bloke to go out of his way for someone he doesn’t know on the other side of the world.’

And the big questions?

First of all, Lucas asked: ‘How many stars are there?’

Mr Garbeff said no one has counted, but scientists estimate that there are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

Close to the action: NASA space expert Ted also talked about animals in space and which countries came second and third in the race to land on the moon, which was one of Lucas's questions

Transatlantic message: The engineer was filmed giving a tour of the base and advised Lucas and his classmates to listen to their teachers, before saying he hoped to see them all 'up in space one day'

Space fanatic: Lucas' father James said: 'When I was a kid I wrote to NASA and got a brochure, so when Lucas was doing a project on space I thought we might be lucky if we sent a video of Lucas asking some questions'

Science enthusiast: Lucas is fascinated by all things science and space so was obviously thrilled when he received the message

Next,
 Lucas wanted to know ‘who came second and third in the race to the 
moon’. Mr Garbeff said he would place Russia second, and China third – 
although only the US has put a man on the moon.

Finally, Lucas asked if 
any animals have been sent to the moon. They haven’t – but  several have
 gone to space, Mr Garbeff said. He also explained that his work 
involves studying planes and rockets and ‘figuring out how things work’.

Thanking Lucas for his ‘great’ questions, he added: ‘It’s really a 
lot of fun being an engineer – you get to play with great toys all day 
and most importantly you get to learn about the world.

‘It wasn’t 
easy, though,  getting here, I had to work really hard. So remember to 
work hard in school and listen to your teacher.’

He urged Lucas to work 
together with his class to solve problems, and signed off: ‘So hopefully
 one of these days I’ll see you all – maybe up in space.’

Thrilled: James said the video was 'amazing' and added that Ted had thought about his audience and gone to a lot of trouble just for them

Personalised: Mr Garbeff said the video had been 'super fun' to make, 'especially as Lucas asked such great questions'
