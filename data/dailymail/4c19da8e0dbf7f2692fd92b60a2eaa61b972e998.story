A jobless thug whose pet dog mauled his partner's 11-month-old baby to death has been spared jail despite sending her vile Snapchat messages threatening to murder her and abuse her corpse.

Lee Wright, 27, bombarded his former partner Chloe King, 21, with a serious of sickening messages which included blaming her for the death of Ava-Jayne Corless in February.

The baby had been sleeping when she was brutally savaged by Wright's American pitbull terrier.

Vile: Lee Wright was spared jail despite sending a series of sick threats to his former partner - after his American pitbull terrier mauled her 11-month-old daughter to death

Wright and Miss King were watching television downstairs when the dog killed the girl, and although they tried to rescue her from the jaws of the pet, she suffered horrific injuries and died in hospital. 

Following the attack, Miss King ended the relationship.

Two weeks ago Blackburn Magistrates' Court heard that Wright then sent abusive messages, also calling her a 'slag' and a 'slut', saying 'it was your fault Ava died'. 

Appearing via video link at Blackburn Magistrates' Court today, Wright was given an 18-week prison sentence, suspended for two years and a two-year supervision order after he pleaded guilty to harassment at an earlier hearing.

Restraining order: Wright is banned from making contact with Miss King or her mother Claire for two years

He was also given a two year restraining order banning him from any form of contact with Miss King or her mother Claire King.

And he was ordered to stay at home between 7pm and 4am for 12 months and told to pay a victim surcharge of £85 and costs of £85 to be taken from his benefits.

The court heard that when Miss King told Wright the relationship was over, he sent her a number of insulting messages before she contacted the police out of desperation.

He was warned not to have any further contact with her but on August 6 he bumped into Miss King and was 'very apologetic' and she felt sorry for him, prosecutor Chrissie Hunt said.

'She began to speak to him while making it very clear she wanted not further relationship with him, however a couple of weeks after contact was reinstated he began to send her messages which included images of pills and rope,' she said.

Jobless: Wright swears as he enters Blackburn Magistrates' Court two weeks ago

'The defendant began to utilise social media in order to contact Chloe King, which she ignored. 

'Then he created false Facebook profiles to contact her. Miss King has tried desperately to block contact from that particular source.

'The defendant's behaviour deteriorated towards the end of August and the messages became worse. He sent her a list of things he wanted to do prior to killing himself - the list included publishing intimate photos of her.'

Ms Hunt added that in September Miss King saw Wright near her home and was so concerned that she withheld her number and phoned him to ask what he was doing.

Mitigation: Wright's lawyer Paul Huxley said his client was 'absolutely gutted' as to what happened in February

Miss King's mother Claire - the grandmother of Ava-Jayne - then tried to speak with Wright's mother to discuss his behaviour while he was present.

However, during the summit he ran upstairs and cut himself with a Stanley knife, the court heard.

When he was eventually arrested and interviewed by police, Wright remained defiant - asked why he went near her house, he said 'I will go where I want, it's a free country'.

In mitigation, Paul Huxley said his client was 'absolutely gutted' as to what happened in February and he feels a huge amount of responsibility for the incident.

He added: 'I'm not going to discuss the dog itself because that's not relevant, but what then follows on is press interest and a huge amount of public interest to the point gentlemen walk down the street and he is verbally shouted at by random people. 

'He has been shunned by his friends and it must be said, this has been the worst year of his life.

'He has made a foolish and immature comment about killing her and freezing her - it's ridiculous to say the least.'

Blackburn JPs considered the aggravating features of his case but decided to suspend his sentence so he can be rehabilitated in the community.

Chair John Wainwright said: 'This has caused stress, been over a long period of time and included photos. 

'This was emotional and caused distress to the complainant and her family. The reason for this sentence is for punishment and rehabilitation. 

'This is to allow you to react with the probation service over a prolonged period of time.'
