A rector who handed out 550 pounds in tenners to his congregation in the hope that they would invest it was handed back nearly £10,000 on Easter Sunday.

The staggering return on his generosity, which amounted to over sixteen times his original outlay, not only humbled Reverend Richard Steel but meant that much needed renovations can now be completed.

Richard, 55, rector at Kirkheaton Parish Church in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, decided to put his hand in his own pocket last November to help with a final push to raise £73,000 to help with the building work.

Generous: Rev Richard Steel gave out crisp ten pound notes to his parishioners last year so that they could invest and make money to help pay for church renovations

Payback: Richard received £10,000 from his parishioners today after they invested his generous donation

Taking his cue from the Parable of the Talents in the Bible - where Jesus tells the story of a man who entrusts money to his servants - Richard wanted to see some creative ideas for a return on his investment.

Richard said he had never expected such a huge response to his ten pound giveaway.

Speaking on Easter Sunday, he said: 'The whole thing has been fantastic and very heartwarming.

'Everyone involved has dug deep and been very, very thoughtful.

Charity: The money and gifts were handed over at a special service held at the church on Easter Sunday, three months after he gave out the original tenners

Imaginative: After giving out £550 pounds Richard has now been given back £10,000 in cash and goods from his canny parishioners who invested the cash

'One 11-year-old girl handed me £550, she has been making homemade cards and selling them for 75 pence each, that is a lot of cards.

'Another woman just handed me £50, she said she didn't know what to do but works as a volunteer and sometimes she gets paid so she gave me a day's wages.

'One man was left some jewellery after his mother died and has been selling pieces of it, he gave £500.

Grateful: The reverend has thanked his parish for being as inventive as they where in paying back the money

'Nine thousand pounds is such a tremendous total and much of it has been raised by the congregation, along with gifts and donations from others.

'The whole process has been really life inspiring to those taking part.

'I just want to say a huge thank you to the congregation. They are a fantastic bunch of people.

'The handing out of the money was a good idea as a lot of these things wouldn't have happened if I hadn't. There are people from eight to 80 who wouldn't have been able to give anything unless they had that little bit to get them started.

'I gave £10 to a woman on Thursday so maybe it will keep on going.'

Engineer Steve Jackson, 49, was one of the congregation who took a tenner and it helped him start making birdboxes, a surprisingly lucractive sideline that has brought in over £700.

He said: 'The £10 spurred me on to get started.

'Everyone seemed to want one once they heard about them, all the business has just been through word of mouth.

'I've made about 30 and I am stopping taking orders after Easter.'

Steve's sister, Sara Jackson, also took a £10 note at the service and like her brother felt compelled to put it to good use.

Faith: Rector Richard Steel hands out the £10 notes to his parishioners to invest in the hope that parishioners will make a fortune to help with church repairs.

Parable: The rector has taken inspiration from the biblical tale where a man entrusts money to his servants

She said: 'Once people heard about it they kept coming up and asking what I was going to do with the money.

'If I hadn't taken the money I would have probably just baked a cake or something but I decided to make chocolate truffles instead.

'I made one batch before Christmas and another for Easter.

'With the Christmas batch I made £280 and I still have to count up what it will be for Easter.

'I didn't realise how much attention it would get but it has been great for the church and people have really taken notice and helped.'
