A report detailing Jimmy Savileâ€™s abuse of up to 1,000 children on BBC premises has been delayed, it was announced last night.

Dame Janet Smithâ€™s review of the paedophile DJâ€™s victims at the corporation was expected to be published later this month.

But now it will be shelved until the middle of the year, at the request of police and prosecutors who want it delayed until after the trial of former presenter Stuart Hall.

Last night victims' lawyers expressed disappointment at the setback.

It means the BBC is spared a crisis, for now, over the scale of Savile's offending.

The report is expected to accuse BBC executives of turning a blind eye to the rape and sexual abuse of up to 1,000 boys and girls in the corporation's changing rooms and studios.

The review, led by former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith, is expected to suggest the abuse took place on BBC property for more than four decades.

In three known cases, Savile carried out his abuse with the help of others connected to the BBC, the review has heard.

A source said: 'It will go right to the heart of how Savile was able to get away with the most heinous of crimes under the very noses of BBC staff for more than 40 years.'

Yesterday a spokesman for the Dame Janet Smith Review said: 'The Review recently received a request from Lancashire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service to postpone delivery of its report until the criminal proceedings against Stuart Hall have concluded in mid-2014.'

He said there were concerns it could 'adversely affect the fairness of Mr Hall's trial', and said Dame Janet Smith had agreed to postpone her report.

Liz Dux, a lawyer at Slater & Gordon representing 74 victims of Savile, said: 'The victims will be naturally disappointed by the delay in the release of this report. They have been living with the trauma of this matter in the spotlight now for 16 months.

'Those that have given evidence to the Dame Janet Smith review were pleased with how sympathetically they were listened to but there has been no follow up support given by the BBC after they went through the trauma of giving their statements.

'They will understand the reasons why the release of the report has been delayed but for them their suffering continues until answers are given.'

The Dame Janet Smith Review is expected to overshadow the investigation led by Nick Pollard, former head of Sky News, which sought to uncover why the BBC dropped its Newsnight programme on the Savile allegations.

Police investigations have so far uncovered that at least 450 people were abused by the Jim'll Fix It presenter on BBC premises.

They also say at least 1,300 people were attacked by him over the course of 54 years.

Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is said to have carried out most of the attacks in the 1960s and 1970s, when his popularity as a BBC presenter was at its peak.

However, aged 79 he groped a teenage girl while filming the last Top of the Pops.

Described as Britain's worst ever paedophile, Savile's abuse also took place on NHS premises, prompting a further review expected later this year.
