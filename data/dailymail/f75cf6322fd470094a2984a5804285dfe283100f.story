A domestic abuser murdered his girlfriend with a kitchen knife then told police he 'enjoyed' being Tasered and they needed 'more volts', a court heard.

Andre Bright, 30, is accused of stabbing Victoria Adams to death while their baby daughter slept in her home in Oldham, Greater Manchester - just two days after she voiced fears he would kill.

The 22-year-old told friends Bright had thrown a bottle at her, spat in her face and talked about having sex with her friends, a jury heard, prompting her to flee tearfully in her dressing gown.

Bright denied murder as a trial began today at Manchester Crown Court, where the public gallery was packed with relatives of Miss Adams and her alleged killer.

The pair met in 2007 when Bright was 23 and Miss Adams was just 16, and entered into an on-off relationship before she had his daughter in August 2013.

But the jury heard Bright had a number of girlfriends and other children, would only meet Miss Adams late at night and they never did things as a couple.

When his girlfriend took a pregnancy test in January 2013, she sent a text to Bright telling him she was pregnant - to which he allegedly told her to delete his number and never speak to him again.

Their relationship reconvened, but events came to a head on December 5, 2013, when the college graduate went on her first night out with friends since giving birth.

Bright called at her home in the early hours of the next day, and his alleged behaviour was said to have led his tearful girlfriend to flee in her dressing gown and bare feet to a friend's house.

Bright was said to have begun calling other girls in front of her and putting them on loudspeaker.

Fears: Miss Adams had been in an on-off relationship with Bright since she was 16 and he was 23

Mark Kellett, prosecuting, said: 'She told them that she had run from her house fearing that Andre Bright would kill her.'

Then on the night of December 7, Bright was out drinking in Oldham with friends when he was refused entry to a bar.

Said to be a known troublemaker, Bright - who was barred from a number of nightspots - confronted a bouncer and then attempted to urinate on him, said Mr Kellett.

CCTV footage showed Bright pulling an Afro comb from his hair and repeatedly stabbing the bouncer's face and head, causing cuts and grazes, jurors heard.

Bright also denies a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in relation to this incident. 

Miss Adams left her home for a second time when he arrived in the early hours, and did not return until she knew he had gone.

But he later arrived at about 9.35am drunk and high on cannabis and cocaine, prosecutors said.

Nearly 30 minutes later he rang the emergency services and told the operator: 'Someone is dying in front of me... someone has stabbed her, I don't know what's happened. She's dying.'

But he allegedly became angry as the call handler asked for more information, and when asked for the third time how the stabbing had happened he replied 'shut up' and put the phone down. 

Miss Adams died two hours after the attack at Manchester Royal Infirmary

Post-mortem results showed she had been stabbed once to the chest, causing a wound 8cm deep, and once to the abdomen. That wound was 12cm deep and had penetrated her kidney.

When police arrived Bright was allegedly standing with a 'fixed, almost vacant gaze', with his hands in his tracksuit pockets while Miss Adams lay dying on the floor near the front door.

Fearing he may still have a knife, police Tasered him and warned they would do so again - to which he replied: 'I enjoyed that. You need more volts in your Taser', the jury heard. 

One female officer said Bright looked directly at her and smiled as he was put in a police van.

Mr Kellett said: 'The Crown say this defendant knowing what he was doing was seeking to ridicule and intimidate the officers.

'A paramedic with the North West Ambulance Service saw Victoria Adams lying in the hallway of the property on her back with her legs facing into the sitting room.

'She was bleeding heavily to the chest and officers were administering first aid.

'He tried to question her, but she kept asking where the baby was. The baby was upstairs, safe, where the officers could take control.'

Aftermath: Dozens of floral tributes were laid at the scene of the killing in Oldham, Greater Manchester

Bright, from Oldham, denies murder, saying it was a combination of an accident and psychotic incident

The court heard Bright accepts that he killed Miss Adams, but will argue that it was a combination of an accident and a psychotic incident.

But Mr Kellet told the jury: 'The Crown say that you will be sure that stabbing Victoria twice was not an accident, it was a deliberate intentional act.

'Moreover, in terms of his intention to cause really serious harm at least, what other intention could the defendant have at the point of stabbing her?

'The Crown say that he was fully aware of his actions and their consequences.' 

Bright, from Oldham, denies murder and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The trial, which is expected to last around two weeks, continues.
