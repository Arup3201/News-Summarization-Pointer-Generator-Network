Syria's ambassador to the UN was attacked last night for making an 'utterly grotesque' comparison between the bloody repression in his country and last year's riots in Britain.

At least 15,000 people have been murdered by dictator Bashar al-Assad's regime since the uprising began in March last year.

By comparison, five people lost their lives in the riots that swept across England last summer – none of them at the hands of the police.

But Syria's UN ambassador Bashar Jaafari appeared to suggest that his government should not be criticised for the brutal crackdown – claiming that David Cameron had stressed the need for national security when dealing with the riots.

Syrian government forces have carried out a series of bloody massacres against civilians.

But Damascus refuses to accept responsibility, claiming they are conducted by terrorist groups.

Mr Jaafari said: 'Our national security is also important.

'We are a sovereign state and in all the presidential statements there is a clear cut reference to safeguarding the sovereignty of Syria.

'You may remember the Prime Minister, what he said one day when the troubles erupted in London. He said that when it is related to the national security, “Don't talk to me about human rights”.

'I am not repeating what he said. I am saying we care about the human rights of our people but we cannot do everything alone. There are third parties in the domestic crisis in Syria.'

Mr Jaafari appeared to be referring to comments made by Mr Cameron last year when he said he would 'not let any phoney concerns about human rights get in the way' when it came to finding and charging suspected rioters.

Mr Jaafari's comments drew angry criticism from Britain's ambassador to the UN, Sir Mark Lyall Grant.

He said: 'Coming from a representative of a regime that is now responsible for the deaths of well over 15,000 citizens, the Syrian ambassador's comparison of his regime's response with what happened in England last summer was utterly grotesque.

'It just goes to show how untenable the position of the Syrian regime has now become, and how desperate are the few remaining people willing to defend it.'

Labour MP Ann Clwyd, a member of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said: 'It is so crass. People will be shocked by that assessment, which bears no relation to reality. The carnage that is going on in Syria, with innocent men, women and children being slaughtered, cannot be compared to the riots – it is absolutely ludicrous.'

It emerged last night that Assad could be offered safe passage to a UN conference on the future of his country under a plan being pushed by Britain and Syria.

David Cameron and the US are prepared to open talks with Assad on moving to a transitional government led by someone else and including figures from the current regime and the opposition.

One UN official said it was possible that the deal could include clemency for Assad, though that would be highly controversial.
