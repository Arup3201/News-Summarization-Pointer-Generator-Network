In a strange case from Georgia, investigators are trying to track down a man who is wanted for the rape of a child last month but has been living under the same name as a high-profile British actor.

Kallis Shannon Kirkland, 28, is accused of raping a juvenile on or around January 22 in Albany.

However Kirkland has been going by the alias 'Benedict Cumberbatch', police say.
