A pair of suicide bombers struck outside Nato's largest base in southern Afghanistan today killing 23 civilians and wounding 50 in one of the bloodiest attacks in recent weeks.              

A
bomber on a motorcycle first blew himself up in a parking lot outside Kandahar  
airbase which was packed with truck drivers and other civilians waiting to get into the 
facility. 

A few minutes later, as people 
gathered at the site of the blast, another bomber on foot walked into 
the crowd and detonated his explosives, said Ahmad Faisal, a spokesman 
for the provincial governor.

Four provincial governors from the 
south were at a meeting at the sprawling Nato base in Kandahar when the 
twin suicide attacks took place, General Abdul Hameed, Afghan army 
commander for the southern region said.

A
spokesman for the Nato-led force said the coalition was aware of the 
incident, but directed all questions to civilian 
authorities.     

Also today officials and villagers in Logar 
province, about 30 km south of Kabul, said a Nato air strike killed 18 
civilians, including women and children, along with six Taliban 
insurgents.    

The
Nato-led International Security Assistance Force said there was an air 
strike in the area during a raid on a Taliban commander, but there were 
no civilian deaths. It said two women received non life-threatening 
injuries and that a number of insurgents were killed.

Violence has surged across Afghanistan since the Taliban began a spring offensive in April, vowing to target the Afghan government and security forces, as well as the 130,000 foreign troops in the country.          

Kandahar, the birthplace of the Taliban, has seen some of the worst attacks.   

The violence has stoked concern that 
Afghan forces may struggle against a Taliban insurgency at its deadliest
once most Western combat troops leave by the end of 
2014.                

Ahead
of the handover, foreign and Afghan forces have stepped up operations 
in the southern and eastern strongholds of the Taliban.    

On Wednesday, the coalition and Afghan
forces conducted an operation in the Baraki Barak district of Logar 
province against a Taliban commander.         

Rais
Khan Sadiq, the senior police detective for Logar, said 18 civilians 
were killed in the air strike that followed the raid - five women, seven
children and six men, three of them elderly.

'The air strike was on two houses,' he said. Six insurgents were also killed, he said.

But Nato spokesman Major Martyn Crighton said the coalition had received no information on civilian deaths.             

'We can confirm there was an Afghan and coalition mission in Baraki Barak district last night or early this morning. We can confirm in follow-on assessments the security force discovered two women who had sustained non-life-threatening injuries,' he said, adding they were treated at an ISAF facility.

'Beyond that, we don't have anything at this stage,' he said.      

President Hamid Karzai has repeatedly warned against civilian casualties in military operations. He said last month that a strategic partnership agreement signed with the United States was at risk of becoming 'meaningless' if Afghans did not feel safe.
