The Government's NHS reforms have seen bosses handed nearly £1.6billion in redundancy payments over the past four years, the Mail reveals today

Nearly £1.6billion in redundancy payments has been given to NHS bureaucrats in the past four years, including thousands who have since been rehired.

In the past 12 months alone, at least £8million was spent paying off 40 managers, handed cheques for £200,000 or more.

A revolving door in the NHS means 4,000 managers paid off since the last election later returned to the health payroll.

Labour said it amounted to mismanagement of the health service.

A government spokesman said the cost in redundancies as a result of NHS reforms was much lower than anticipated, adding there were thousands fewer managers.

Official figures published yesterday showed that in the last full financial year, 2013-14, a total of 6,330 exit payoffs were signed off for NHS staff, at a cost of £197million.

Added to figures from earlier years, this took the total to 38,419 individual deals totalling £1.588billion. 

The figures also showed that in the same period, a total of 237 managers were given payoffs totalling between £100,000 and £150,000. 

Another 83 were handed cheques of between £150,000 and £200,000, and 40 walked away with more than £200,000.

Since 2010-11, payouts to NHS managers have included 1,693 of between £100,000 and £150,000, and 596 worth £150,000 to £200,000. 

At least £74million was spent on 370 payouts worth more than £200,000.

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said Labour had predicted David Cameron’s reorganisation of the health service would cost at least £3billion and ‘this shows we were right – it explains why the NHS is now in such a financial mess’.

He added: ‘This scandalous waste cannot be justified when older people are being denied essential hip and cataract operations and when cancer patients are waiting longer for treatment.

‘Nurses denied a modest pay rise will find it galling to see millions wasted on six-figure payoffs for managers who were then rehired. It amounts to mismanagement of the NHS on a mammoth scale.’

Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said the restructuring of the health service should cost no more than £1.5billion, and save an annual £1.5billion from this year onwards.

Last week government auditors revealed that growing numbers of health trusts are getting into financial problems.

The Department of Health said the total cost of redundancy payments directly resulting from NHS reforms was £456million – less than half the figure originally predicted.

A spokesman said: ‘There are now nearly 7,000 fewer managers and over 16,450 more clinicians than in 2010.’
