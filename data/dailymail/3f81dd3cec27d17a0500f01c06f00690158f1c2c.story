One in ten households in the UK now have assets worth more than £1million, experts have found.

Soaring house prices in London, rising share prices and brimming pension pots mean that more people than ever are sitting on huge virtual nest eggs totalling £5.5trillion in Britain.

But the figures analysed by the London School of Economics also show a growing wealth gap, with the richest one per cent now having 850 times more in assets than the poorest in society.

A picture of Britain's wealth: One in ten households had assets worth £967,200 in 2010, but experts say this is now worth at least £1million

Figures show the very wealthiest own an 
average of £2.8million of assets compared to the average £3,600 of debt 
by those most struggling to get by.

Professor John Hills, who lead the study, found that 10 per cent of UK homes had total assets of £967,200 in 2010, but an upturn in the UK economy since then means this 'has pushed the entry point into that wealthiest tenth over the million-pound mark today', he said.

Around 2.5million of households are in this enviable position.

And the majority are those most well-off 
are middle aged, having benefited from decades of rising house prices 
and also various inheritances.

Academics said today that this proves that Governments policies in key areas like tax and benefits are inconsistent and fail to narrow the increasing wealth gap in the UK.

The research was funded by the Nuffield Foundation with support from the Economic and Social Research Council.

'Our research shows that there are very sharp differences in treatment between people.  Some are strongly encouraged and helped by the tax system to accumulate wealth in particular forms, while others face strong disincentives from means-testing to do so.  People can even face both at the same time. These systems often reinforce wealth inequalities, rather than narrow them,' Professor Hills said.

The study showed that a typical family has total household wealth of £232,000 – although many of them feel far from wealthy and regularly face a struggle to make ends meet.

While they have significant assets, much of it is tied up in something which they cannot actually use to pay for the weekly food shop or their rising energy bill, such as their pension pot or their home.

The Office for National Statistics has also looked at the same figures and found there are huge regional variations in the number of millionaire households.

The South East is the biggest winner, with 15.5 per cent – or more than one in six – of households in the richest 10 per cent, compared to only 6.9 per cent in Scotland and 7.6 per cent in the North East and North West.

Their research shows the effect of the house price boom. Many of the millionaire households bought their properties decades ago and have seen their value soar.

There are 668,500 households between the age of 45 and 54 and 929,600 households between the age of 55 and 64 who are in the richest top 10 per cent of Britons. Because they are nearing retirement, they often have very large pension pots.
