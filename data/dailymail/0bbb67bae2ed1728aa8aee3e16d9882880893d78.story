It is one of the strangest photographs returned from Mars yet - giving a snapshot of what Mars was like when it had a dynamic surface.

The small spherical objects in this image from Opportunity - still scouring the surface of Mars after nearly 10 years on the Red Planet - are tiny mineral-rich nodules, nicknamed 'blueberries' by NASA, which are sticking out of the face of a crater.

Now the Opportunity has been joined by the Curiosity - but the older brother is still proving its worth, capturing the geological formations which show how Mars was once a wet world with surface water.

The 'spherules' are small - only three millimetres across each - and have been magnified for this image, which shows an area only 2.4inches (6 centimeters) across.

They appeared on an outcrop called 'Kirkwood' in the Cape York segment of the western rim of Endeavour Crater.

The Microscopic Imager took the 
component images during the 3,064th Martian day of Opportunity's travels
- September 6th by Earth time.

Opportunity discovered spherules at 
its landing site more than eight-and-a-half years earlier, and they were
promptly nicknamed 'blueberries'.

They provided important evidence 
about long-ago wet environmental conditions on Mars because researchers 
using Opportunity's science instruments identified them as concretions 
rich in the mineral 'hematite', which was deposited by water saturating 
the bedrock.

However these spherules are different
- they do not have the iron-rich composition of the blueberries, and 
also differ in concentration, distribution and structure.

Some of the spherules in this image have been partially eroded away, revealing concentric internal structure.

Opportunity's science team plans to 
use the rover for further investigation of these spherules to determine 
what evidence they can provide about ancient Martian environmental 
conditions.

Opportunity’s principal investigator, Steve Squyres of Cornell University, said: 'This is one of the most extraordinary pictures from the whole mission.

'Kirkwood is chock full of a dense 
accumulation of these small spherical objects. Of course, we immediately
thought of the blueberries, but this is something different. We never 
have seen such a dense accumulation of spherules in a rock outcrop on 
Mars.'

The Martian blueberries found 
elsewhere by Opportunity are concretions formed by action of 
mineral-laden water inside rocks, evidence of a wet environment on early
Mars.

Concretions result when minerals 
precipitate out of water to become hard masses inside sedimentary rocks.
Many of the Kirkwood spheres are broken and eroded by the wind. Where 
wind has partially etched them away, a concentric structure is evident.

Opportunity used the microscopic 
imagern its arm to look closely at Kirkwood. Researchers checked the 
spheres’ composition by using an instrument called the Alpha Particle 
X-Ray Spectrometer on Opportunity’s arm.

Squyres added: 'They seem to be 
crunchy on the outside, and softer in the middle.,They are different in 
concentration. They are different in structure. They are different in 
composition. They are different in distribution.

'So, we have a wonderful geological 
puzzle in front of us. We have multiple working hypotheses, and we have 
no favorite hypothesis at this time. It’s going to take a while to work 
this out, so the thing to do now is keep an open mind and let the rocks 
do the talking.'

Just past Kirkwood lies another science target area for Opportunity.

The location is an extensive 
pale-toned outcrop in an area of Cape York where observations from orbit
have detected signs of clay minerals.

That may be the rover’s next study 
site after Kirkwood. Four years ago, Opportunity departed Victoria 
Crater, which it had investigated for two years, to reach different 
types of geological evidence at the rim of the much larger Endeavour 
Crater.
