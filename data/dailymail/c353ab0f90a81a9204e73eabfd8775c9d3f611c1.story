Declan's mother Paula, 32, a nurse, decided to donate his organs to help save other lives

As 12-year-old Declan Hodgson lay on a life-support machine, his parents sat beside him and stroked his hands.

They
 told Declan they loved him and then, with tears of disbelief, said 
goodbye. They walked on either side of their son as he was wheeled 
towards theatre, in the agonising knowledge that the operation Declan 
was about to have would not save his own life, but that of other people.

The
 previous day Declan, who was born with a heart defect, had undergone 
major surgery. But catastrophic bleeding at the start of the operation 
had starved Declan's brain of oxygen and he was pronounced brain dead.

In
 the midst of almost unimaginable grief, his mother Paula and father 
Kevin were asked if they were willing to donate their son's organs. They
 didn't hesitate.

'It would be selfish not to give others a chance 
of life,' says Kevin, 35, a civil servant. 'As painful as the process 
was, we were determined to view it as a positive decision.'

It's now
 a year since Declan's death, and while the family's grief is still raw,
 they are proud of the fact their son's kidneys, liver and pancreas have
 helped save three other people's lives.

'No matter how poorly Declan
 was, he remained positive. He never gave up. He was such a loving, 
brave boy and I would do anything to have him back, says Paula, 32, an 
orthopaedic nurse. 'But there was never any doubt that I would donate 
his organs, to spare other parents the heartache we are going through.'

Yet
 figures released yesterday to mark National Transplant Week suggest 
many other families would behave differently: 45 per cent of people 
refuse to donate their loved one's organs because they don't know what 
that person wanted; the figure rises to 47 per cent for children.

In 
the past five years, 112 children have died because no donor organ was 
available. Currently, 149 under-18s in the UK are waiting for an organ.

According
 to NHS Blood and Transplant, the authority responsible for organ 
donations, many parents are driven by a misplaced desire to protect 
their children, even after their death.

'I think some also 
mistakenly believe not as much effort will go into saving their child's 
life because their organs are needed,' adds Paula.

'But I can't stress enough how important it is that they donate. It is the right thing to do.'

Although
 children's organs are mainly used for other children, they can also be 
given to adults depending on the organ needed. So one of Declan's 
kidneys and his pancreas saved a woman in her 40s, his other kidney 
helped a woman in her 20s and his liver saved a teenage boy.

'Declan was simply excited that he was having an operation to make him better,' says Paula

'Knowing I had saved someone else's child, especially, gave me strength,' says Paula, through tears.

Declan
 was diagnosed with congenital heart disease - a defect in the structure
 of his heart - soon after his birth in May 2001. His lips had turned 
blue and he was transferred to the paediatric unit at Leeds General 
Infirmary.

Scans showed that the blood vessels in his heart were in 
the wrong place, while a blockage was obstructing blood flow to his 
lungs. The wall dividing the left and right lower chambers of his heart 
was also faulty. As a result blood was not being pumped properly around 
his body, causing cyanosis - where the skin turns blue because of poor 
circulation - and fatigue.

Doctors warned Kevin and Paula that, as Declan grew up, he would need operations to improve the efficacy of his heart.

If
 these were successful, his life expectancy could still be normal. In 
the meantime he would need to take aspirin every day to thin his blood 
so that it could circulate better.

Kevin, from Wakefield, Yorkshire,
 says: 'We clung to the hope that Declan could still lead a normal life -
 especially as he developed healthily as a baby.'

In fact, at six 
months Declan was deemed robust enough to endure a nine-hour operation 
to have a shunt - a 3cm tube - fitted in his heart to create a detour 
from the heart to the lungs, so blood picks up more oxygen and 
circulation is improved.

The operation was a success and Declan blossomed.

'He
 occasionally grew tired if he over-exerted himself, but refused to let 
it hold him back,' says Kevin.

'He took his first steps at a year and 
thrived at school.'

(Although Kevin and Paula separated when Declan was 12 months old, they remained friends and shared custody of their son).

But in 2008 Declan, then seven, fell and cut his arm.

Although
 only a small 2cm graze, within days he developed flu-like symptoms, 
caused by an infection in his blood that travelled to his heart. The 
following month he was diagnosed with endocarditis - a potentially fatal
 heart infection.

Declan spent three months in hospital on an 
intravenous antibiotic drip. Though the infection cleared up, his heart 
had become weaker.

Paula says: 'His condition could have deteriorated
 anyway. We'll never know if the cut was the cause.' Declan grew so 
lethargic that she had to drive him the half-mile to school. 'If he 
exerted himself he would turn blue or throw up,' says Kevin.

'Declan dreamt of being a footballer and asked why he couldn't run around like his friends. It made us constantly anxious.'

In
 January 2010 Declan underwent surgery to have a large vein connected 
directly to an artery, bypassing the heart so blood could go straight 
into the lungs to be oxygenated.

But his condition continued to 
deteriorate and last year his consultant said he needed another, similar
 procedure. This was the only treatment option left - without it, he 
would need a heart transplant.

'We never talked about this with Declan. We thought he was too young to understand,' says Paula. They
 were warned the operation carried a risk of brain damage, internal 
bleeding and infection. 'Because his life expectancy was limited anyway,
 we didn't feel we had a choice,' says Paula.

The 12-hour operation 
took place on June 12 last year. 'Declan was simply excited that he was 
having an operation to make him better. I told him I loved him and 
promised that everything would be OK,' says Kevin.

Declan's father Kevin says it would have been hypocritical to say no

But early on in 
the procedure, surgeons discovered Declan's heart lining had fused to 
his ribcage. Opening the ribs caused his heart to bleed, and in the time
 it took for surgeons to stop the bleeding, Declan's brain was starved 
of oxygen.

His consultant told Declan's parents he had suffered an 
irreversible brain injury. 'It was a nightmare I couldn't comprehend,' 
says Paula. 'I screamed and vomited.'

Their son was pronounced brain
 dead at 3am on June 13. Shortly afterwards, a specialist organ donation
 nurse - on call in every hospital - asked Declan's parents whether 
they'd let his organs be used to help others live. 'Given that Declan 
would have needed a transplant, it would have been hypocritical to say 
no,' says Kevin.

Aside from Declan's heart and lungs which were 
damaged, the couple agreed to donate everything else except his corneas.
 'His blue eyes were so sparkly,' says Kevin. 'They reminded me of how 
happy he had been and I couldn't stand the thought of them being taken 
away.'

By 6pm the transplant nurse had found three recipients for 
Declan's kidneys, pancreas and liver. The process is time-sensitive as 
organs don't last for long outside the body. A liver can survive between
 six and eight hours before transplant, a pancreas 12 hours and a kidney
 up to 24 hours.

Declan was kept on the life-support machine until 
that evening and the recipients had been prepared for surgery in other 
hospitals. As his parents kept a vigil by his bedside, a nurse cut a 
lock of his strawberry-blond hair for them to keep and created Declan's 
handprints out of clay.

Then the family was moved into a private room to say goodbye.

'We
 kissed him and told him we loved him,' says Kevin. 'I had promised 
Declan he would be OK and he wasn't. I felt I had failed my son.'

At Declan's funeral, the 200 guests were banned from wearing black.

'We
 wanted it to be a celebration of life and the love everyone felt for 
Declan,' says Kevin. 'I miss everything about him, from the way he 
bounded into bed with me in the morning for a cuddle to the Barnsley 
football matches we watched together.'

Paula has kept Declan's 
bedroom untouched. Sometimes she sits amid his Horrid Henry books and 
football posters, inhaling the boyish scent still on his dressing gown.

'I still wake up some mornings and for a few seconds forget my beautiful boy is not here,' she says. 'My heart is broken.'

Last
 month, on the anniversary of Declan's death, the couple received a card
 from the lady who had received Declan's kidney and pancreas.

She wrote about how sorry she was for what had happened to Declan, and said she would be for ever in their debt.

'We were incredibly touched,' says Paula. 'I feel ready to meet the recipients now - I think it would give me hope.'

Adds Kevin: 'We would do anything to have Declan back. But knowing he has helped others means his legacy lives on.'
