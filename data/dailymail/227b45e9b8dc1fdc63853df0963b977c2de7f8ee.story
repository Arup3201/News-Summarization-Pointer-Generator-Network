At least two of the three babies whose skeletal remains were found in a filthy Massachusetts home may have been alive 'for some period of time', a court heard today.

Both bodies were found wearing diapers and one-piece infant outfits in closets in the vermin-infested Blackstone home, assistant district attorney John Bradley said at a pretrial hearing for Erika Murray in Uxbridge District Court.

Murray, 31, has been held without bail since her arraignment last month on charges of fetal death concealment, witness intimidation and permitting substantial injury to a child.

She did not appear in front of the judge, who set her bail at $1 million. 

Murray’s attorney Keith Halpern said she is spending about 23 hours a day in isolation for her safety.

In August the state Department of Children and Families removed four children ranging in age from six months to 13 years from Murray's home in about 50 miles southwest of Boston along the Rhode Island border. 

They were discovered after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's house and asked for help in quieting a crying baby.

After interviewing the older children, police got a search warrant and went back to the house, where they found the skeletal remains of one baby with a full head of hair in a backpack in the closet of an upstairs bedroom

The neighbor found the youngest child, a six-month-old covered in feces and a three-year-old child. 

Neither child has birth records and both are severely malnourished  - the infant is extremely sensitive to sunlight and the three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds.

Today Bradley told the court both of them are developmentally delayed, reports CBSBoston.

'The pediatrician determined that the two had been profoundly neglected. 

'The muscle tone of the three-year old was such that it appeared she had spent most of her young life on her back,' said Bradley.

Police investigators work outside a home after they discovered the remains of three infants inside a home filled with bugs and trash including dirty diapers piled several feet high, in Blackstone, Massachusetts

Blackstone code enforcement officer Bill Walsh said when he walked inside the smell was overwhelming, reports the Boston Herald.

The second floor looked like a landfill and was 'unbearable.'

He said the hidden upstairs were like 'jellyfish,' covered in feces and maggots surrounded by hundreds of dirty diapers.

Murray arrived at the house and agreed the children should not live in the home, but did not seem to be upset they would be removed from her care and appeared more concerned about her cat which had disappeared. 

After interviewing the older children, police got a search warrant and went back to the house, where they found the skeletal remains of one baby with a full head of hair in a backpack in the closet of an upstairs bedroom.

After discovering those remains, police obtained another search warrant.

During the second search, they found the remains of two other babies in another bedroom, also inside a closet.

The state medical examiner is trying to determine whether they were newborns or fetuses.

Murray's attorney, Keith Halpern, has said he believes Murray is suffering from a mental illness.  

Today the Boston Herald reported that Murray gave birth to her first child in 2001 after meeting her partner, Raymond Rivera who was seven years older, when they both worked at McDonald's.

The young family lived with her parents, but when she became pregnant again aged 21 they moved to Rivera's sister's three-bedroom house in Blackstone and she moved out.

Friends and family told the news outlet this is when Murray's mental health began to deteriorate. 

Wearing baggier clothes and not inviting people into her home, she became pregnant twice more, giving birth at the house - it was the bodies of those babies which investigators found.

She then gave birth to two more children - the three-year-old and the six-month-old baby. 

Halpern says that he believes Murray secretly gave birth to those children because her boyfriend didn't want any more kids than the two they already had together, the 10-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl. 

Murray's boyfriend and the father of the children, Ramon Rivera, has not been charged in connection with the discovery of the infants' remains, but faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the home's basement

Initially Murray kept them hidden upstairs when Rivera, 37, was home. 

She told police that it was only in the summer she told Rivera and her two eldest children of their existence but insisted that she was babysitting them. 

He is thought to be the father of all seven children, but did apparently did not know he had two younger children, according to investigators. 

Today in court Halpern insisted it did not make sense that he did not know about the conditions in the house.

'There are parts of this story that make absolutely no sense,' said Halpern, reports CBSBoston.

'It makes no sense particularly given how small this house was, that he could've lived in this house and shared this bedroom and not realized that there were these two that shared the house with him.'

Rivera, has not been charged in connection with the discovery of the infants' remains, but faces drug charges for allegedly growing marijuana in the home's basement. 

Prosecutors also said that the charges against Murray could be upgraded once a grand jury investigation concludes. 

The Blackstone Board of Health condemned the house where Murray, Rivera and the children lived and are planning to demolish it later this month. 

Investigators working in the small house had to wear hazardous material suits. 

'The house is filled with vermin,' the prosecutor said in August. 

'We have flies. We have bugs. We have used diapers, in some areas, as much as a foot-and-a-half to 2-feet high.'

Marilynn Soucy, 68, who lives a few doors down, said she was still in shock at the news in the neighborhood where she has lived for 35 years. 

'I am so disgusted. It hasn't really registered in my head yet,' she said. 'My husband and I raised seven children. We have 11 grandchildren and two great grandchildren. I cannot imagine hurting a child.' 

She said she and her husband, Bob, had rarely seen the couple who lived in the house for at least three years, or their children.

She said they occasionally saw the 10-year-old, a boy, playing outside or the woman sit on her porch.

Soucy said she never heard any major complaints about the couple, other than her grandkids noted once that the house smelled bad.  

The two older children are staying with a paternal grandparent, while the two younger ones are receiving medical attention under foster care.
