The $100million wrongful death lawsuit filed against Elle McPherson's billionaire husband Jeffrey Soffer that was withdrawn last month has been refiled in a different court.

Bob Martinez said that Daria Pastouhkova Gogoleva refiled the lawsuit Friday in Miami Dade Circuit Court claiming Mr Soffer is responsible for a helicopter accident that killed her husband, Lance Valdez, in 2012.

The original complaint made similar claims but was filed in Miami Federal District Court.

'Soffer was flying the helicopter at the time of the... crash, and he was responsible for the crash that killed Lance Valdez,' the suit claims, according to the New York Post.

'Despite being responsible for the death of his friend, Soffer repeatedly lied to and intentionally deceived Daria about his involvement in the crash in an effort to persuade her to pursue an insurance recovery rather than a claim against him,' claims the suit.

The grieving widow is suing for wrongful death, fraudulent inducement and conspiracy - she is seeking a jury trial, the Post reported.

Robert Martinez, Mr Soffer's lawyer, told the paper that 'a bad lawsuit doesn’t get any better just by refiling it in another court.

The lawyer claims the original lawsuit was withdrawn only one day before Mr Soffer was planning to file a motion to have it dismissed.

'That lawyer now says that he made a mistake and has filed the same complaint in another court,' he continued. 'The complaint rehashes the same mistakes and false accusations.better just by refiling it in another court.'

Supermodel Elle Macpherson is also accused
 of helping her billionaire husband conceal he was flying the helicopter.

Macpherson urged widow Daria Valdez to take the payout after husband 
Jeffrey Soffer, who also owns Miami’s Fontainebleau Hotel, piloted the 
chopper into the ground November 22, 2012 in the Bahamas, the lawsuit said.

-Soffer was at the helm despite not being licensed to fly. A licensed 
pilot was on board the aircraft but not at the controls, the suit 
alleges. The $100million wrongful death suit was filed 10 December Miami.

A copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline claimed that Soffer was at the controls when the helicopter when it crashed on Great Cauna Cay last year, taking the life of tax lawyer Lance Valdez.

‘Contrary to published newspaper reports, at the time of the helicopter crash the helicopter was being piloted by Jeffrey Soffer,’ the suit claims.

‘Soffer was not licensed to fly,’ the suit continues. ‘[Nor was he a] sufficiently experienced helicopter pilot.’

The suit also accused supermodel Elle Macpherson of taking part in the conspiracy by personally  calling close friends for the purpose of having them convince the devastated widow to take the money.

'Soffer induced…Elle Macpherson…to call Charles Holzer, another close friend of both Lance and Daria, and told him that Soffer was annoyed about Daria’s delay in signing the release, telling Holzer that ‘Soffer doesn’t have to do this you know,' the suit alleged.

Taking the millions in hush money meant signing a release relieving Mr Soffer of all liability stemming from the crash, according to the suit.

'They knew Daria was beset with grief…at the time that they inappropriately pressured her to sign a release they knew was based upon false information,' the suit said.

'They took undue and improper advantage of her and the situation and circumstances surrounding the helicopter crash,' it continued.

Pilot David Pearce also signed a lawsuit guaranteeing him a six-figure salary with Mr Soffer's company in exchange for swearing he was piloting the helicopter at the time it crashed, according to the suit.

Mr Valdez, 48 and a father of three, was joined on the flight by a handful of other people but was the only one who did not survive the accident, according to the suit.

Daria Valdez, now a widow, claims in the suit she was handed $2million in insurance hush money to keep quiet about Mr Soffer piloting the chopper into the ground.

According to the lawsuit, co-defendants Daniel and Paula Riordan, as well as Alex Krys, were also on board the ill-fated flight and conspired with Mr Soffer and the pilot to conceal who was actually flying the chopper when her husband died.

‘The defendants] conspired and otherwise agreed to conceal… [that Mr Soffer] was flying the helicopter at the time of the crash,’ the suit said.

‘The purpose of this concealment and deception was, in turn, to induce [Mr Valdez’s widow] to accept $2million in insurance proceeds from insurance maintained on the helicopter… and to withhold from any civil or other action against [Mr] Soffer,’ the suit explains.

The Riordans are employees of Mr Soffer, Mr Krys is his COO, according to the suit.

Ms Valdez, who goes by Dasha, according to the Post, was convinced to keep quiet about Mr Soffer’s involvement in her husband’s death while grieving over the loss of the father of her three young children – aged two, seven and nine.

Mr Soffer took advantage of her fragile emotional state in order to avoid ‘his own liability in an exponentially greater amount as compared to the $2million,’ according to the suit.

'Despite being responsible for the loss of his friend, [Mr] Soffer repeatedly lied to and intentionally deceived Daria about his involvement in the crash in an effort to persuade her to pursue an insurance recovery rather than a claim against him.'

The suit also claims that Mr Soffer led Mr Valdez to believe he was a licensed and experienced pilot, as well as fled the scene while first responders tried to revive his best friend’s lifeless body.

The hotel magnate is licensed to fly - fixed airplanes, not helicopters.

'He was recklessly flying and controlling the helicopter at the time of the helicopter crash without an up-to-date and valid helicopter pilot's license,' the lawsuit further claims.

‘Soffer arranged to have himself and the Riordans transported by boat… in order to escape, flee and/or remove himself and the Riordans from the Bahamas before any investigation of the crash could be conducted,’ according to the suit.

He did not contact Mr Valdez’s widow until four days later, and also skipped his pal’s funeral.

'Jeff Soffer is very sympathetic to Dasha and the children for their grave loss [and] denies all the allegations of wrongdoing,' his lawyer told the New York Post in a statement. 'Mr. Soffer has no further comments to make at this time since the lawsuit is now pending in federal court.'
