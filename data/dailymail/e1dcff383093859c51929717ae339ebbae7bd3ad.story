Testing: A Harrods customer tests the store's cherries - some of the first to be grown outside this year

Everybody wants a bite of the cherry... but you’ll need deep pockets to do so – as Harrods has opened this year’s season for the fruit by selling them at a juicy £1.65 each.

At the upmarket store in Knightsbridge, West London, The Mail on Sunday paid £41.16 for a punnet that weighed 294g (10.5oz) and contained just 25 cherries.

At £140 a kilo (or £64/lb), industry sources said this was a ‘record’ price for early-season cherries.

The fruit is not available at all until April, when the only supply in the world comes from heated Spanish greenhouses.

But the Harrods cherries are among the first of the year to be grown outdoors.

Bruce Langlands, the store’s director of foods, said: ‘We sell French Glamour Edoa cherries from a small producer in the Pyrenees with a limited number of trees.

'They grow in the open and are only available for four weeks in the year. Each cherry is hand-picked at optimal ripeness with direct, same-day distribution into Harrods.

‘The producer only supplies Harrods with this variety. As these cherries are very difficult to grow, very few people do. Because they are so rare, they are expensive.’

But even more common varieties of cherry might plunge the average family budget into the red.

At Marks & Spencer on Friday, a 200g (7oz) pack of cherries cost £5. With 20 cherries in the pack each cherry worked out at 25p.

A Marks & Spencer spokeswoman said: ‘It’s early for the cherry season but demand is outstripping supply and that is why shoppers are having to pay these prices.

'Next week though the season comes into full swing, cherries will be in abundance and prices will come down.’

Morrisons cherries will also be on 
promotion from tomorrow, with a 10oz punnet priced £2 – almost 20 times 
cheaper than Harrods’ variety.

Stone me! Our receipt and one of the fabulously expensive cherries from the upmarket Knightsbridge store

Last
 night, The Mail on Sunday gave four people blind tests with cherries 
from five stores; Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Fortnum & Masons, 
Harrods and upmarket organic chain Whole Foods.

Two of our tasters preferred Harrods cherries, while two opted for the Whole Foods range.

Federica Richards, 25, a South African living in London, chose Harrods as her favourite and Tesco as least enjoyable.

‘I usually buy my cherries from Sainsbury’s but the Harrods ones are just as good,’ she said, adding she would expect to pay about £6 for a packet.

When told how much the luxury store was selling its cherries for, she said: ‘Oh, I’d never pay that, that’s ridiculous.’

Barbara Frantini, 31, originally from Italy but living in the capital, said the ‘sour and tasteless’ Harrods cherries were the worst and Whole Foods ‘the best by far’.
