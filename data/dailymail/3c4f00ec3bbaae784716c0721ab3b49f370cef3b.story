Nathaniel Clyne and Jonjo Shelvey are the surprise call-ups by Hodgson for his England squad.

The Southampton right-back has not won a cap for England, but his strong displays this season have earned him a place.

On his inclusion, Hodgson said: 'He's impressed us for a while. Even before the World Cup he was a name we were constantly considering, but there were others in front of him then.

Jonjo Shelvey, who won his first England cap in 2012, has also been called up to Roy Hodgson's squad

'Now we've lost Glen Johnson and Kyle Walker. John Stones played there but we're looking for someone else who would be an interesting candidate for the right-back post.

He was considered even before the last two matches, this time he's asked to come.'

Hodgson revealed that Swansea midfielder Shelvey was in a similar position. 'He's another player like Clyne who's constantly in our thoughts and discussions.

'The way we're looking to play could suit him. He's had an excellent start to the season and he's there on merit because of his form and qualities he possesses.' 

Shelvey revealed the call-up is a proud moment and that his family are delighted by the news.

England manager Hodgson claimed Clyne and Shelvey have constantly been in his thoughts

'It’s fantastic to be called up by England at any level, but to be called up to the senior side is a very proud moment for me, said the midfielder. 'I’ve just spoken to my family and they’re all over the moon.

'It’s nice to be recognised for my performances in recent weeks. Hopefully I can show everyone what I can do in the upcoming international matches. My main focus is on the game against Newcastle this Saturday, but I am looking forward to training with England on Monday.

'It’s a big thing for me and my family. There will be a lot of my relatives in the crowd supporting me. A lot of it is down to Garry Monk and the coaching staff here with the way they have got us playing. We have earned a lot of praise for that. During the last international break there was only about eight of us here training, so it’s a credit to everyone at Swansea for earning international recognition.'

Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher tweeted after the squad was announced: 'Delighted for Shelvey call up to the England squad didn't quite happen at Lfc but shows how regular football can help players development.'

The former Liverpool defender later added: 'Thought there may have been an outside chance for Downing as he's doing well in a diamond system at West Ham, which England will use.'

Arsenal left-back Kieran Gibbs has also been named in Hodgson's squad along with Gunners team-mates Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.
