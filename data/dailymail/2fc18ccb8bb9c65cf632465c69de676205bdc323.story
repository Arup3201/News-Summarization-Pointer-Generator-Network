A pilot whose plane was running dangerously low on fuel used the aircraft's parachute system to ditch the plane in the Pacific off Hawaii on Sunday.

The man's landing was all caught on camera - as well as the moment he was plucked to safety by rescuers out of the water.

Coast Guard video shows the plane releasing its parachute and briefly dropping nose-first before leveling out and plopping into the sea. The pilot escapes out the top of the aircraft and drifts away in a small raft from the plane before it rolls over on its top.   

Trouble: The pilot traveling from Tracy, California, to Maui radioed authorities of plans to ditch at 12:30:pm because of dwindling fuel

Heading down: The plane makes toward the water - 253 miles off of Hawaii 

Pilot: The man used the plane's parachute system and landed in the water 

Maneuver: The Coast Guard directed the pilot to put down near a cruise ship called the Veendam

Recovery: The pilot is seen peering out after his plane landed in the water 

The pilot safely landed in the water after being in contact with the US Coast Guard 

Adrift: The pilot lies in his life boat after he managed to ditch the Cirrus SR-22 in the water 

The cruise ship then plucked the pilot to safety unhurt shortly before 5:30pm, the Coast Guard said

Danger: The pilot only had about three hours' worth of fuel when he made the ditch 

Later that day, four people on a different plane were rescued after they, too, had to ditch their plane.

The Coast Guard says the separate incidents Sunday involved a Cirrus SR-22 plane carrying a solo pilot 253 miles off the island of Maui, and a Cessna with four people aboard just a few miles off the island of Oahu.

In the first incident, a pilot traveling from Tracy, California, to Maui radioed authorities at 12:30 p.m. about plans to ditch a Cirrus SR-22 aircraft because of dwindling fuel - only about three hours' worth.

The Coast Guard directed the plane to go down near a cruise ship called the Veendam.

'At approximately 4:44 p.m. the pilot was able to deploy the aircraft’s airframe parachute system and safely exit the aircraft into a life raft,' the Coast Guard said in a release.

'The pretty unique thing about about a Cirrus is that the aircraft itself has a parachute on board,' co-pilot Lt. JG. Michael Carman told KHON. 'So the aircraft orbited and when they were 5,000 feet above the water, slightly in front of the cruise ship, they deployed their parachute.'

Amid 9- to 12-foot seas and winds of 25 to 28 mph, the cruise-ship crew rescued the pilot, who was in good condition, authorities said.  

Later Sunday, the single-engine Cessna plane with four aboard ditched 11 miles off shore.

The Coast Guard said in a release 'At 6:18 p.m., the pilot contacted the Hawaii Control Facility at Honolulu International Airport and declared and in flight emergency 30 miles west of Oahu. The pilot reported the aircraft was running out of fuel and that the aircraft may have to ditch.

'At 6:27 p.m., the aircraft disappeared from radar and lost communications.'

A Coast Guard helicopter hoisted the three adults and one child.

KHON reported there was a 22-year-old woman, a 24-year-old man, a 37-year-old man and a 1-year-old girl on the plane, and listed their conditions as stable.

Lt. Commander Clay Cary told the affiliate station 'We searched for a little bit and were able to locate a light in the water, that’s the only thing we saw, we didn't see any wreckage right away.

'So we came down into a hover and found the light was attached to a life jacket down there and when we looked a little closer we saw we had survivors in the water.'

Petty Ofc. Donnie Walker told KHON 'Seeing the small child and how small and in fact and in - young it was was emotional, but you just get it done and get 'em out of there, you know, so it's over for them.' 

Officials say all four were treated for undisclosed injuries. 

The plane was flying from Kauai to Oahu.

Second rescue: Later Sunday, the single-engine Cessna plane with four aboard ditched 11 miles off shore

Treatment: Officials say all four of the rescued plane's passengers were treated for undisclosed injuries

Survival: A Coast Guard helicopter hoisted the three adults and one child to safety after their Cessna plane was extremely low on fuel on Sunday

Embrace: There was a 22-year-old woman, a 24-year-old man, a 37-year-old man and a 1-year-old girl on the Cessna plane, and they are believed to be in stable condition
