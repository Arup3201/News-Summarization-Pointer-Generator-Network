The hottest looks for autumn/winter 2015  menswear will be statement jumpers, sheer trousers... and plastic bag hats.

At least that's the message coming from the house of Christopher Shannon judging by his presentation at London Collections: Men this weekend.

The young Liverpudlian designer sent many of his male models down the runway with their heads and faces covered in corner shop carrier bags. The unlikely  accessory was also seen fashioned into pretty neck ties or jewellery by the show's co-stylist Judy Blame.

Many of the black, white and striped 'masks' had little holes cut in them so the models could see where they were going.

The headpieces topped many of the outlandish outfits from his collection, which featured knitted statement jumpers - with sombre slogans such as 'Broke', 'Broken', 'Save Me', and 'Thanks 4 Nothing' - cinched with tutu belts, chunky work boots and slashed or sheer trousers.

In reference to the pinstriped peplums Shannon told Dazed Digital: 'The thing is, that's the top of a boxer short so it is a nod to another street code, another way of dressing, breaking those things a part a little bit, and trying to find a new line for sportswear, because I think that's our job, isn't it? I think that's my job at least, apart from paying bills!'

Shannon got his MA in Menswear at legendary fashion school Central Saint Martins, and has worked with heavyweights like William Baker and Helmut Lang. 

He's had his own label for several years and has earned a reputation for sportswear-influenced menswear  heavy in contemporary colour-blocking, feminine frills and quirky embroidery.

London Collections: Men is the male equivalent to London Fashion Week and while not yet as popular, it aims to emphasise the creative and commercial importance of British brands and emerging talent in the capital.

All events on the schedule - including shows from Barbour, Burberry, Belstaff and Tom Ford - are designed to showcase the breadth of British fashion talent, from the world's most innovative emerging talents to global menswear brands and Savile Row tailors. 

The Designer Showrooms are split across two venues with Ready-to-Wear designers at the Hospital Club and NEWGEN MEN and Accessories designers at Victoria House. 

In addition to the BFC Presentation Space at the Hospital Club and the BFC Show Space at Victoria House, there will also be a BFC Show Space at the Old Sorting Office. 

The event runs until Monday January 12.

Boys wear pink at Sibling

In terms of colour and thread the theme at Sibling this season was definitely Cheshire Cat.

For AW15, the trio who make up Sipling presented a pink and punky collection of striped jumpers and scarves, socks and striped animal toys all made from candy-coloured yarn.

Some jumpers had a sports sweatshirt-inspired look, while others were intentionally holey with cobwebby loose weaves

Models with painted hair carried giant teddy bears as they presented jumpers, shorts and onesies all in the same rich fuchsia shade.

Knit styles varied from item to item - some jumpers were neat bar the colour composition, some were intentionally holey or lumpy, while others resembled stretched out, crumpled cobwebs.

Sibling has become known for bright and playful  knitwear, Breton stripes and vibrant colour.
