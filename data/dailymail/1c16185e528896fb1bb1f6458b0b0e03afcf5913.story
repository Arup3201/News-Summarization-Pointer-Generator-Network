The dogs taking part in the agility events at Crufts each year appear to have the time of their lives.

And now you can live their moment with them thanks to a POV GoPro recording of two dogs taking part in the Flyball.

In the video dog owners can be seen attaching cameras to the collars of a pair of excited pooches – a Border Collie and a Springer Spaniel.

Barking in excitement, the Border Collie waits for its owner’s command to go and then springs into action jumping over the four gates and pouncing on the spring-loaded pad at the end.

After catching the tennis ball the dog turns and makes its way back – the GoPro picking up the frenetic footage of the dog bounding happily towards its owner.

Next is the turn of the Springer Spaniel who, if possible, appears to run even quicker.

Hurdling the gates and collecting the ball, the dog runs back towards its owner and jumps up excitedly.

Floppy ears: The excited Springer Spaniel hurdles the four gates at great speed before collecting the tennis ball in its mouth

The two dogs are briefly shown at the end dropping the tennis balls at the feet of their owners and receiving a pet for their hard work.

Crufts 2015, which kicked off on March 5, presents dogs in the gundog, working and pastoral, terrier and hound, and toy and utility categories.

The Flyball, which is hugely popular with the crowds, features on all four days of the show with the team final being held on Friday 7.
