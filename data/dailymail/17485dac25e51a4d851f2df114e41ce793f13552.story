A vintage Rolls Royce that was given to screen goddess Marlene Dietrich by her Paramount studio bosses is set to fetch £350,000 at auction.

The Phantom I sedan was given to the actress and singer to help her settle in to Hollywood life when she moved there in 1930 from her native Germany.

Dietrich was often photographed being chauffeur-driven around Los Angeles in it and the car even went on to feature in her first Hollywood film Morocco in 1930.

The blonde siren sold the 1929 Rolls Royce Phantom I Convertible Sedan in 1945 to a millionaire - and it has been in private ownership ever since.

It is now come to public light again after its current owner, a classic car collector, died recently and his family decided to sell it at auction.

Screen presence: Dietrich reportedly fell in love with the car and it went on to be used in her first Hollywood 
movie, Morocco, in which she starred opposite Gary Cooper

When the late vendor bought the Rolls 
Royce it was in a decrepit condition with its original green paintwork 
being stripped back to its shell.

He spent tens of thousands of pounds on restoring the motor to its former glory before his death.

It is likely to be highly sought-after not only because of its association with the screen legend but it is also unique.

Before giving it to Dietrich, Paramount Studios commissioned a custom car body builder to turn it into a stylish convertible.

The finished product cost £17,000 and was one of the most expensive cars in the world at the time.

The car comes complete with a small 
shelf in the back that still houses Dietrich's compact mirror for 
make-up and two bottles of perfume.

Eric
Minoff, of auctioneers Bonhams which is selling the car, said: 'It was 
given to Marlene Dietrich as new in 1930 by Josef von Sternberg, a movie
director at Paramount Studios.

Interior: The car's former owner spent tens of thousands of pounds on restoring the car to its former glory

'She was seen in it quite a lot with her driver in the front while she sat in the back.

'Both Dietrich and her green Rolls Royce became quite popular in the Hollywood area and she was photographed frequently in it.

'After
the war she sold the car to a man from Colorado and it remained in his 
family until it sold to the current vendor in the 1990s.

'It
didn't have much paint left on it and it was in a pretty tired and sad 
state by that stage. It hadn't been driven in a long time.

Original fittings: The car even comes with Dietrich's make-up mirror and two bottles of her perfume

Horsepower: The 'straight six' engine was painstakingly restored to pristine condition

'The current vendor commissioned a full restoration of the car and had it returned to its former glory. He spent a lot of money on it to make it a knock-out car that she used to be.

'We will have to wait and see whether the family will get the investment back on the car but a lot of these people do it as a labour of love.

'It is being sold by his estate. It is a cracking and really gorgeous car.

'We have had a lot of interest in it because of its history.' The auction is being held by Bonhams at Scottsdale, Arizona, on January 19.
