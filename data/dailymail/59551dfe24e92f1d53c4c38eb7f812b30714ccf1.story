The second-highest official in the Archdiocese of Newark, New Jersey is stepping down in the wake of a sex scandal involving a former priest accused of violating an agreement barring him from working with children.

After the Reverend Michael Fugee was accused of molesting children, vicar general Monsignor John Doran signed a court document promising to supervise the priest in the future.

However, Fugee was discovered to have violated his lifetime ban on ministering to children last week, leading to Doran's resignation.

Monsignor John Doran, a senior church official in the Newark, New Jersey archidoces resigned after he failed to properly supervise a priest with a history of molesting children

Church officials say that Doran's resignation is among several changes the archdiocese says it's implementing to protect children.Â 

The changes are noted in a letter from Archbishop John Myers, which will be read in parishes across the archdiocese this weekend.

'Appointing a new Vicar General will be just one step in a 
comprehensive plan to strengthen our 
internal protocols and ensure we are doing everything we can to 
safeguard the children of our community,' Myers said in the letter.

He continued to note that an outside review found 'operational failures' in the handling of the Rev. Michael Fugee, who also resigned this month.

Rev. Michael Fugee broke an agreement with law enforcement to never work with children. He was forced to resign from the Catholic church, along with his supervisor John Doran

Myers statement doesn't blame Doran, who had been vicar general for six years, for the lax in oversight..

Fugee, 52, was convicted in 2003 of fondling a boy in Wyckoff.

However, that verdict was vacated because of judicial error. Fugee 
entered a program to avoid retrial, overseen by Doran, and agreed to never again work with 
children.

Fugee violated his agreement when he recently attended youth retreats and heard children's confessions.

Myers has faced heavy criticism over his handling of the Fugee case, with victims' advocates and some politicians calling for him to resign.

But in the letter, Myers said the archdiocese has an 'exemplary record of addressing allegations against our clergy.'
