Daisy Lowe, the rock star spawn, model, and socialite, has posed for Vs. magazine’s high-minded cameras in a new sultry fashion shoot.

The 24-year-old English native appears in a spread shot in New York City.

Photographed by Guy Aroch and styled by Tatler Russia fashion director Anya Ziourova, the spread has Lowe stripped down in NYC subway stations, bodegas, wine shops, and diners in bits of lingerie and some of fall 2013’s best coats.

‘Indecent exposure is a regular occurrence on the streets of New York. But most flashers don’t look like Daisy Lowe…’ reads the fashion feature’s introduction.

The spread comes along with interesting timing. Last month New York played home to a series of models who publicly exposed themselves in restaurants as part of an art project.

Vs. magazine's Lowe feature was inspired by Marc Jacobs’s fall 2013 collection for Louis Vuitton, in which the designer paired dainty negligees and smatterings of underwear with sumptuous outerwear and accessories.

‘Daisy and her irrepressible curves explored the grittier side of the city in fall’s most luxurious coats with (almost) nothing underneath,’ continues the introduction.

The spread features clothing by Stella McCartney, Chanel, Sonia Rykiel, and Eres, among other labels.

Lowe, who is praised for her curves in the spread, recently spoke out about her body.

'I'd rather be fit than thin. I can dance for longer. I feel stronger, healthier, brighter and less stressed,' she told The Sunday Times Style magazine. 'Diets feel like starvation. I love a belly on a woman - it's so beautiful. I want Beyoncé's body.'
