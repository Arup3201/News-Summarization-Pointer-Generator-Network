Germany faces an angry backlash in the US where it has been accused of making a 'dangerous over-reaction' to spying revelations.

Responding to German offers of political asylum to fugitive US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden after he revealed Angela Merkel’s phone had been bugged, some commentators have accused pacifist Germany of forgetting who its true friends and enemies are.

Germany’s defence and intelligence capabilities have been constrained since the end of the Second World War.

US media have responded with fury to German offers of political asylum to fugitive leaker Edward Snowden

Many Germans who have expressed support for Snowden may be forgetting they have lived for years under the umbrella of US protection, say American critics.

The German newspaper Die Zeit reflected the anti US-feeling in its cover this week which shows a US-German heart logo breaking apart above the headline 'Goodbye Friend!'

Germany has also been accused of making a 'dangerous over-reaction' to allegations that security services bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone

Writing on the US website The Daily Beast yesterday, commentator James Kirchick said: 'The hue and cry over American espionage illustrates just how out of touch many Germans are about the world, and their country’s place in it.'

Mr Kirchick, who is based in Berlin, warned that 'welcoming Snowden…would risk a rupture in transatlantic relations more severe than anything caused by American spy methods'.

It would also 'adversely affect Germany’s own internal security, which is heavily dependent upon the help it gets from the NSA and other American intelligence agencies', he said.

He quoted an unnamed German intelligence official who this week conceded that 'without information from the Americans, there would have been successful terrorist attacks in Germany in the past years'.

The crisis escalated after the German foreign ministry announced it had asked Britain to respond to a report that its Berlin embassy is being used as a covert listening post.

The report claimed that documents from the US National Security Agency, together with aerial photos, suggest the British could be operating a spy station using equipment housed on the embassy roof.
