A family which has produced only male offspring since 1913 has welcomed its first female arrival in a century 

The all-boy run was finally broken when Jeremy Silverton, 43, and partner Danielle Andrews, 36, welcomed a daughter called Poppy.

She is the first Silverton female since her late great aunt Jessie Silverton who was born 101 years ago when King George VI was on the throne, women had no vote and the WWI was still a year away.

It's a girl! Danielle Andrews, 36, and Jeremy Silverton, 40,  are celebrating the birth of their first baby girl in a century - breaking a streak of 21 boys over four generations

Jessie’s parents, horse and cart driver Edward Silverton, and his wife Emma had five children between 1910 and 1917.

Between them, Jessie, older siblings Amy and Edward, and younger brothers Vick and John, went on to have five children themselves - all of them male.

Amy had two sons, Ronnie and Vick, Jessie had a boy called Peter, Vick had a baby called Roy and John had a son called David, who is Jeremy’s father.

Welcome to the world: Since 1913 the Silverton clan have had nothing but male children, defying odds of 10,000 to one but the spell was finally broken when Jeremy Silverton, 43, and partner Danielle Andrews, 36, finally welcomed a daughter called Poppy.

It's a man's world: (Back row left-right) Amy, Jessie's sister, Jessie Silverton, Mark Rouse, Amy's husband, Tots, Jessie's aunt, Hilda Silverton David's mother, Emma Silverton, Jessie's mother, John Silverton, David's father, and (front left - right) Jessie's son Peter Kindell, six,
Vic Rouse, David's cousin, 14, David Silverton, 11, and Monica, Tot's daughter-in-law at Lulworth Cove

The all-male generation added seven more children of their own to the family tree - again, all of them boys - leaving Jeremy with a brother, Christopher, and five male cousins.

Jeremy, a farmer and agricultural lecturer of Tiverton, Devon, already has two sons, Oscar, four, and Harry, six.

They brought the grand total of male births to 16 before the chain was broken by Poppy on September 9.

She arrived at 8.45pm at the Royal Devon and and Exeter Hospital weighing a healthy 8lb and 11oz.

Danielle’s mother Jo had predicated a girl because of the way her care worker daughter was holding herself but Jeremy dismissed it as superstition.

Little Princess: Her parents say Poppy is likely to be very spoiled being the only girl but Harry and Oscar, their two boys, are taking it all in their stride

But he then started to paint his blue nursery pink after doctors took an ultrasound and confirmed a daughter was on the way.

Jeremy said: 'It’s always a 50/50 chance, you could flip a coin to guess but it just so happens that up until now our family has only had boys.

'However, Danielle’s mother is the superstitious type and saw signs of it being a girl.

'I just thought it was an old wives' tale but because Danielle wanted a girl so badly we decided to go get a scan to find out the gender.

'We couldn’t believe it when we got the news from the scans. As soon as we got home the previously blue nursery was repainted pink and white - there was no time wasted.

'When I first told my mother over the phone it took about five minutes for the penny to drop that she would be having a granddaughter and not another grandson.

'Poppy is likely to be very spoilt being the only girl but Harry and Oscar, our two boys, are taking it all in their stride.

'As far as children know a baby is just a baby, it’s only when she gets older and stops playing with tractors and cars that they will start to notice a difference - that is, if she stops playing with tractors and cars.'

Fit and well:  Baby Poppy arrived at 8.45pm at the Royal Devon and and Exeter Hospital weighing a healthy 8lb and 11oz
