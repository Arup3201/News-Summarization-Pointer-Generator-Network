The England rugby team will have the weight of the nation on their shoulders at the World Cup 2015 on home soil, but they will at least know that a herbal cocoon body wrap will be close to hand. 

With all things going to plan, the Stuart Lancaster-coached hosts could spend the preparations for all but one game at the World Cup - a group A match in Manchester - in their favoured  headquarters at Pennyhill Park in Surrey.

Chris Robshaw and his team-mates will be based at the Bagshot facility and have access to not just the expertly kept football pitch but The Spa, where whatever body or beauty treatment they could possibly desire will be found.

Headquarters: Pennyhill Park in Surrey where England's rugby team will stay during the World Cup

Perfect preparation: Chris Robshaw and his England side will be at their preferred Bagshot resort

Winding down: After a tough day England will have access to a wide array of spa facilities 

The hotel's adjoining spa offers a wide range of treatments including de-stress hot stone or vitality massages that could prove a godsend after a battering 80 minutes of action at Twickenham. 

And if they really want to feel special they could get a Man-i-cure, Pedicure for Men or a Gentleman’s Tonic facial. 

The football pitch is pristine, as discovered by the visiting NFL team the Oakland Raiders during their recent stay there before their match at Wembley. 

The gym is fully equipped for elite athletes with Technogym equipment, each with its own entertainment system, and a Junckers sprung exercise studio. There's also a wide range of classes such as pilates, yoga and aqua aerobics if they're up for some 'extras'. 

If it's outdoor relaxation that's required, the nine-hole golf course, pools and hot tubs should do the trick.

Bespoke: No two bedrooms are the same but each has  handcrafted mattresses and a pillow menu

Paddock to plate: Michael Wignall's The Latymer has two Michelin stars to its name

Deluxe: The pool at The Spa, the luxury facility Stuart Lancaster's side will have access to

Extra comfort: One of the bathroom designs, Silver Berch, has two free standing white volcanic limestone baths with a Champagne chiller between them and a large flat screen television recessed into the wall

Dining wise, haute cuisine may not be on the menu for the burly rugby players mid-tournament but it's on offer for the rest of us at two deluxe restaurants - two Michein-starred The Latymer, with chef Michael Wignall, and the more laid-back Brasserie.

No worries about England's chargers not getting a good rest between matches either, with the five-star accommodation extending to hand-crafted mattresses and a pillow menu in each individually designed room. But there could be a worry of them becoming a little too precious with their underfloor heated bathrooms, oversized shower heads and side rain bars.

The country mansion-styled Ascot Bar is perfect place for a tipple at the end of the day also. Though that will be largely off limits to the players until they have the William Webb Ellis trophy in their grasp.
