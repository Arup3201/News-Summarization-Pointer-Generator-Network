The closest thing to a real life Barbie Dream House has just been sold as the mansion of the businesswoman who re-established the doll as an American icon just sold her lavish California mansion.

Former Mattel CEO Jill Barad has sold her Sunset Boulevard house to an as-yet-unnamed buyer for $10.2million, according to Redfin real estate brokers.

The house, which has been on and off the market since 2010, was originally listed for $14.995million.

The Med-style home was built in 1991 with wood paneling

Barad was put in charge of the Barbie line in 1982 - a time when the doll was seeing lackluster sales.

She's credited with making Barbie hot again by coming up with the idea of packaging different version of the doll with different accessories as an enticement for little girls to want more than one.

Under Barad's leadership sales soared, and she was promoted to run the whole firm in 1997.

Her rapid ascent capped a remarkable 
career for the executive, who initially dropped out of college to sell 
cosmetics then became a bit-part actress before entering the toys world.

Barad left the company in 2000 after enjoying mixed success as CEO.

The businesswoman's mansion features 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms,  kitchen, family room, dining room, and even a multi-level master wing with sitting room marble bathroom with 
soaking tub.

It also features a swimming pool, 
luxury spa and even its own 'playhouse', an outdoor pavilion which opens
onto a perfectly manicured lawn.

But photographs of the property 
suggest that the house might not be altogether to Barbie's own tastes - 
rather than the kitsch hot pink decoration seen in the toy's plastic 
properties, it is tastefully decked out with interiors which are only 
slightly over-the-top.
