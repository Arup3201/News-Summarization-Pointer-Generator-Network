Victim of discrimination: Isabel Sitz pictured arriving at her first employment tribunal in July this year

A City banker was fired by a firm dubbed ‘Bunga Bunga Securities’ when she complained about bosses slashing her £95,000-a-year salary to the £6.08-an-hour minimum wage because she was a woman.

Isabel Sitz, 42, told a tribunal how sexist managers at Oppenheimer Europe stripped her of lucrative client accounts.

She said that boss Max Lami gave the best business to 'his boys', who could bond with male clients over beer, rugby and hunting.

Another manager referred to her as 'sweetheart' and male colleagues compared their firm to the notorious sex parties of Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi in emails discussing ‘bunga bunga’, the tribunal heard.

When Miss Sitz alleged gender discrimination over the sudden, £80,000 cut to her basic salary, she was fired the very next working day.

A panel at Central London employment tribunal found that she suffered sex discrimination, victimisation and unfair dismissal.

It ruled that Oppenheimer 'falsely claimed that there had been a real investigation' into Miss Sitz’s discrimination complaint.

It noted that the firm would not let her approach her key contacts when they moved firms to drum up new business - but expected her to introduce her clients to new colleagues.

And a poorly performing male colleague had staged reductions to his salary rather than being put on the then UK hourly minimum wage of £6.08.

Miss Sitz is now set to receive substantial compensation from Oppenheimer for lost earnings and injury to feelings.

In its judgment, the panel ruled: 'Looking at the evidence as a whole - and particularly the difference in treatment between the claimant and her colleagues - there is evidence from which we could infer, in the absence of an adequate explanation, that the claimant has been subject to sex discrimination in her dismissal and the process leading up to it.'

It added: 'We find that the claimant’s gender was a factor in Oppenheimer’s decision to dismiss her.

'In particular, we find that when the claimant’s figures reduced, Mr Lami was less willing to assist her to gain alternative clients than he would have been had she been a man.'

Speaking after the judgment, Miss Sitz’s solicitor Andrej Pungerl, of law firm Stone Joseph, said: 'The tribunal had a full view of all the evidence and came to its decision, which vindicates Isabel and she is delighted by the decision.'

Mr Pungerl declined to say how much compensation Miss Sitz is seeking from Oppenheimer after winning her case.

He said: 'For Isabel, it is about the principle, not the money.

'Without the discrimination, Isabel ‘s career trajectory was of a senior, top broker.'

Miss Sitz joined the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce World Markets in 2007.

The bank was acquired by Oppenheimer, which provides investment services to institutional clients, the following year.

Miss Sitz became an executive director for Oppenheimer, in charge of US equity sales.

Giving evidence, she said: 'There were many comments about bunga bunga. That was done all the time.

'I kept my head down and worked rather than listening but there were also emails sent around, such as the reference to OpCo as ‘bunga bunga securities’ (when bunga bunga refers to erotic parties with sexual favours dispensed to men by women) which to my mind was demeaning.

'I couldn’t believe this was being sent around. Of course I was offended by this kind of thing.'

In each of 2009 and 2010, Miss Sitz made around £1.2 million in revenue for the investment bank.

She earned up to 25 per cent in commission from revenue brought in.

And at her peak, she was the firm’s third best performer, bringing in 12 percent of its total revenue.

But she claimed her performance plummeted after Mr Lami gave the best business to 'his boys'.

She said: 'Max Lami has a PA called Nadia. He would call out her name, ‘Nadia, Nadia’. He was shouting at her.

'And then the boys in the office would shout ‘Nadia, Nadia’. She had to prepare his lunch every day in the kitchen.

'I remember a couple of occasions when he told me: "Isabel, I don’t understand why my wife works. I bring in the money." Things like that really shocked me.'

Miss Sitz said her plight worsened when another boss, Robert Van Den Bergh, stripped her of more accounts and called her ‘sweetheart’.

He said he was handing over her Irish accounts to John Todman because the clients were all ‘boyos’.

She said: 'He called the Irish a bunch of lying, cheating, stealing time-wasters. He then went on to explain it is mostly about beer and rugby in Ireland, and so he thought I should be removed from the Irish accounts and they should be given to Mr Todman who could take the clients to rugby matches.'

It was also said that it would not be appropriate for her to join male clients on hunting trips.

But Mr Van Den Bergh insisted he only removed her from the Irish accounts because she was 'irrelevant and unknown' to the clients.

He said his comments were a light-hearted attempt to take her off the accounts without hurting her feelings.

Mr Lami told the tribunal that Miss Sitz was 'caught up in a fantasy of her own making' after being abandoned by her core client base.

Miss Sitz said she 'begged' to be given more accounts and be allowed to contact potential clients but was 'ignored'.

By 2012 she was left with just four accounts, only two of which made significant money and was a 'broken woman', she said.

She said: “I wanted an equal opportunity for my success which I wasn’t given. I threatened the men. I think they felt threatened by me.

'I don’t like to be all walked over. That is what a woman has to go through in the City.'

Miss Sitz complained of gender discrimination on Friday June 8, 2012 - and was made redundant on the following Monday.

Spanish Miss Sitz, however, lost her claim of race discrimination.

In a statement, the firm insisted today that it was right to fire her - despite the tribunal ruling of unfair dismissal.

It said: 'Oppenheimer Europe was disappointed to learn of the tribunal’s decision, even though it dismissed a substantial portion of the claim, and believes the facts of the case supported a full dismissal.

'We are proud that both our male and female employees, comprising over a dozen nationalities, testified that the company does not engage in discrimination in the workplace.

'The company will review its options with its legal counsel, including taking an appeal of this decision.'
