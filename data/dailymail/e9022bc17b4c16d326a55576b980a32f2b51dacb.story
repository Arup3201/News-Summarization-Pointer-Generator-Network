Parents have branded a secondary school as 'lazy' after it ordered its pupils to wear name badges to class.

Cambourne Village College, which opened in Cambridgeshire two years ago and has 317 pupils, introduced tags to help children get to know each other, manage behaviour and help teachers.

If pupils fail to wear the colour-coded labels showing the pupils' year and initials of their tutor group, they could face a detention.  

Students at Cambourne Village College in Cambridgeshire have to wear name badges as part of school policy

The school's website says the badges are aimed at creating a 'family feel' and claim they 'reduce the likelihood of any child being unkind to others since everyone is identifiable.'

But parents have criticised the school for not learning children's names and say the idea is 'ridiculous'. 

Ruth Swain, whose daughter in Year 8 has been issued with three name badges, said: 'It is the most stupid idea I have ever seen.

'I understand the school is growing and they want to keep that family feel so that everyone knows each other but it's just the height of laziness. Why can't teachers just learn the names like they always have?

'Pupils get to know each other by asking each other's name rather than reading a name badge. It could have a counter-effect.

'My daughter forgot hers and was given a stern telling off. It makes them feel like they're just machines and it's incredibly uniformed.'

While other parents have taken to social media to hit out at the notion. Hasan Osman wrote: 'They should make more effort in educating them, than worrying about who has a name tag on. Ridiculous.'

Vicki Rose posted on Facebook: 'Teachers should learn to remember their pupils' names or can they just not be bothered that is bloody ridiculous!'

Fiona Porter added: 'It's just bloody laziness on the school's behalf. It's not a very good idea.'

The Campaign for Real Education spokesman Chris McGovern said: 'This is a lazy approach, it's dreadful.

'It suggests the teachers are clearly struggling to learn the children's names despite it being half way through the year. It's very, very important that staff learn the name of the children.

Pupils that fail to wear the badges could face detention. Parents have branded the coloured labels as 'lazy'

'If they can't be bothered to learn the name of the children they may as well give up teaching.

'It makes teaching impersonal and teachers are supposed to form a relationship with the pupils they teach whereas this creates distance.

'With computers creating personalised teaching there is less 'whole-class' learning and it really is a reflection of the times that teachers don't feel the need to learn the kids' names.' 

He also warned that the badges could encourage bullying: 'It's an intrusion into their identity and privacy and if any child walked out of school with it accidentally still on it's also a safety issue.' 

The school's policy is that badges, which show their first names, are left in the children's lockers overnight and not worn out of school.

Sarah Smith, who has a child at the school, believes that the policy of leaving them at school is not practical. 

She said: 'It makes it much easier for strangers to approach children if they can see their name. I know they are expected to leave them in their lockers, but if they forget it's very worrying.'

Another mother, Laura Peat, whose son is at the school, is concerned the badges could potentially be used as a weapon.  

'They are extremely sharp and although they are supposed to be left at school, many children wear them home. I saw at least 20 walk past me yesterday displaying their name.'

One mother, who did not wish to be named, said her 13 year-old son has been given countless detentions after making a stand against the rule.

She said: 'My son wore the badge and caught it in his coat and ripped his jumper. He wont wear his and that's his decision, I have encouraged him and tried to be positive about it but he just won't wear it.

'He has had a detention break and lunchtime for the past week so has not been able to get any fresh air. The deputy head told him he is fighting a a battle he simply wont win. 

'My son is quite a quiet child and doesn't want all the pupils calling his name all the time. I am happy for my son to wear the uniform and I am very strict about it, but the badge is a bit over the top.'

The school, which is the most recent to open in Cambridgeshire, received its first intake in September 2013, and currently has two year groups aged 11 to 13.

This year it will have an intake of 180 students and the school has been built for an eventual capacity of 750 pupils and 100 staff.

Headmistress Claire Coates said students who deliberately fail to wear name badges will be 'sanctioned as for a deliberate uniform infringement'.

She said: 'In keeping with many other schools, Cambourne Village College introduced identity badges for students this term.

'In our last parental survey, 97.5 per cent of parents agreed with the statement "this school makes sure its students are well behaved" and name badges help to encourage positive behaviour in our students and to maintain the friendly, community feel of our growing college.

'The vast majority of our students have taken to wearing an identity badge in their usual polite and cooperative fashion.' 

The £20 million pound building has state-of-the-art ICT, sports and performance halls, music and drama studios and large playing fields.
