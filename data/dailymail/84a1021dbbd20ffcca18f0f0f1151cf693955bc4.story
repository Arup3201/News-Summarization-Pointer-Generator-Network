There’s nothing worse than getting a headless pint of beer at the pub.

No one wants to be forced to consume a beverage that’s best served with a head of foam.

But one company has the solution – they’ve crafted a device that will artificially give your beer the topping it needs for the ultimate refreshment.

The Sonic Foamer can give your beer a head at the touch of a button

Called the Sonic Foamer, the device uses ultrasonic waves to create a head on any beer. 

It uses six AA batteries which, according to manufacturer ThinkGeek’s website, can provide you with ‘3,000 foams.’

They promise their beer rescuer, available for $34.99 (£20.89; €25.37), ‘will not flatten the beer.’

It is believed man first learned to make a basic gruel from barley.

Then natural yeast, perhaps supplied by insects, would have fermented the gruel and created a basic type of beer.

Beer was actually easier to make than bread.

After discovering this, humans would have started cultivating grain, settling to tend the crop.

When a button is pressed, vibrations are produced at the bottom of the device.

This creates waves that evenly open up the beer as they travel through it.

The uniform bubbles then create a head of foam when they reach the surface.

This also releases the beer's aromas.

But ThinkGeek warn you should ‘remember to leave room for the head or you’ll be mopping.’

Nonetheless, beer lovers everywhere will surely delight at being able to enjoy their drink as intended whenever they want.

Before and after: ThinkGeek say one set of batteries can provide 3,000 foams
