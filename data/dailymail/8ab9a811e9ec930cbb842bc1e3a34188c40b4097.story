Miles Scott, the 5-year-old cancer survivor who warmed hearts last fall when the Make-a-Wish foundation let him be superhero 'Batkid' for a day, had an appearance at the Academy Awards canceled - and actor Andrew Garfield may be to blame.

The Spider-Man star was set to appear in a segment with Miles, but skipped the ceremony last minute because he didn't like his lines, a source told the New York Post.

Following a montage of superheroes in film, Garfield was supposed to introduce Scott as 'the world's next superhero' with Scott coming onstage for an applause.

Five-year-old Miles Scott made headlines in October when the Make-A-Wish foundation let him be a superhero for a day. He was set to appear at the Academy Awards on Sunday but his segment was cancelled last minute

Where was he? Spider-man star Andrew Garfield was 
supposed to be in a segment with Miles, but skipped the ceremony last 
minute. One source told the New York Post that the actor backed out because he didn't like his lines

The Academy Awards took place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday night and were hosted by Ellen DeGeneres

The boy's family traveled down to Los Angeles from their home in Northern California on relatively short notice to participate in the awards ceremony.

Miles even rehearsed with Garfield for the ceremony in front of a Gotham backdrop that had the name 'Batkid' in big letters on Saturday.

The source told the Post that it was in the middle of rehearsals that Garfield decided 'he didn't like his lines'.

'Garfield refused to go by the script. He came up with his own lines. The producers felt that Garfield’s [rewrites] were not appropriate. Garfield had a tantrum. He stormed off.

'Garfield was such a spoiled brat that he didn’t even want to be a presenter,' the source said.

Early Sunday morning, Miles' family was notified that the segment had been cut without explanation.

'I don’t know if they ran out of time, or if there was something about the segment they didn’t like,' Miles' mom Natalie Scott told the International Business Times. 'It got pulled so quickly that we didn’t have a lot of insight into what was going on.'

The happiest place on Earth: After the segment was cancelled, The Academy Awards paid for the Scott family to go to Disneyland. Above, Batkid (second right) with mom Natalie, dad Nick and his little brother

Mrs Scott says that while her son was disappointed he couldn't wear his fancy tux, they tried to make the most of the trip.

'It is kind of a disappointment, but things happen,' Mrs Scott added. 'I know that’s how TV goes and how Hollywood is. We’re just not used to that; we’re from a really small town.'

As consolation, the family was treated to a trip to Disneyland, paid for by the Academy Awards, and that's how Miles spent Sunday and Monday.

While the Academy offered no explanation to the family, it seems actor Andrew Garfield's disappearance may have played a role in the change of program.

In addition to rumors of creative differences, a source speculated to Radar that Garfield's disappearance was a serious family issue, either at home in England or with girlfriend Emma Stone's family in Arizona.

'If it were a fight or something between [Andrew and Emma] one would have just came without the other, but this seemed to be more of something going on with one of their families.

'With Emma, it’s all family first. And Andrew is so devoted to her that he wouldn’t just leave her in New York dealing with some sort of crisis on her own,' the source said.

Switched: A source speculated to Radar that Garfield may have had to miss the ceremony due to a personal matter, which may have involved girlfriend Emma Stone (pictured together shooting Spider-Man on the left). Captain America star Chris Evans was brought in as a replacement

Captain America star Chris Evans was brought in as Garfield's replacement.

'He got the call pretty much day of that he'd have to go on,' a source close to Evans told US Weekly. 'Chris hadn't been planning on even going to the Oscars'.

The Make-a-Wish Foundation, which organized Batkid's San Francisco superhero day in October, said they had nothing to do with the Oscars segment getting cut.

'Make-A-Wish was not involved in any way with any decision about what did not or what did make it in on-air that evening,' said Josh de Berge, national communications manager for the Make-A-Wish of America organization.
