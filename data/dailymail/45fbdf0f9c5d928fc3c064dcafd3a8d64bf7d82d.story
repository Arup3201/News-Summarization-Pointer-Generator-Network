Ronald Tatchell was in agony after a back operation and died from neglect, an inquest heard

A grandfather was allegedly branded a 'drama king' by an NHS doctor just hours before he died in agony, an inquest heard today.

The coroner decided Ronald Tatchell, 66, died of medical neglect after suffering severe pain following a back operation in hospital.

Hospital officials have apologised to his family over his 'tragic' death with the promise of a full investigation.Â 

The hearing was told that a ward nurse alerted a doctor as Mr Tatchell was in extreme pain - but claimed she was told the patient was a 'drama king'.

Father-of-two Mr Tatchell was the victim of a 'whole system failure' by staff at the 530-bed Llandough Hospital in Cardiff.

Retired bailiff Mr Tatchell was recovering well from the operation and his family was looking forward to him coming home.

But his colour suddenly drained, the whites of his eyes turned yellow and his abdomen became swollen and tender.

Staff nurse Rhian Grapes told the inquest: 'I told the senior house officer who referred to him as being a drama king.'

But senior house officer Dr Olamide Eso denied the nurse's claim - saying: 'I can categorically say that I did not refer to Mr Tatchell this way.

'That's just not how I would speak about my patients.'

The inquest heard that ward manager Sally Lewis became so concerned she went over Dr Eso's head by contacting the surgeon who carried out the operation.

Miss Lewis said: 'I didn't feel the doctor looking after him had assessed Ron's condition enough.'

The inquest heard blood samples taken at 6.30am were marked 'urgent', but the results were not received until around 11.55am.

Surgeon Declan O'Doherty, who carried out a review of the treatment, told the hearing: 'The whole thing was just dysfunctional.

'At no stage did anyone actually know what his state was - I think there's been effectively a whole system failure.'

Retired council bailiff Mr Tatchell, of Bridgend, South Wales, died of hypovolemic shock as a result of haemorrhage following spinal surgery.

Cardiff assistant deputy coroner Christopher Woolley ruled that Mr Tatchell died as a result of neglect by hospital staff.

He said: 'There was a continuous sequence of shortcomings.There's a link between the failure and Ron's death. So I do find there has been neglect.'

Cardiff and Vale University Health Board has apologised to Mr Tatchell's widow Angela, 66, and his two sons Steven, 36, and Matthew, 42.

Director of nursing Ruth Walker said: 'Words are of little comfort at such a distressing time but we would like to offer our sincere and unreserved apologies to Mr Tatchell's family. The failures in his care are absolutely unacceptable.

'While no one individual is to blame, it is clear that the system let down Mr Tatchell, with tragic consequences.

'We have already undertaken a full and in-depth investigation into Mr Tatchell's care which we shared with his family and the coroner ahead of the inquest.

'We will review urgently the detail of his findings to make sure that we address fully all of the failings identified.'
