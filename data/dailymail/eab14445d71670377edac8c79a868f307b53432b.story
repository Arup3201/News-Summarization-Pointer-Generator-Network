This could be the prelude to a formal engagement announcement. I hear that Prince Harry is planning to take Cressida Bonas to Balmoral this summer.

It would be the 25-year-old dancer’s first visit to the Queen’s Scottish retreat and would be likely to involve a meeting with Her Majesty.

‘Prince Harry is expected to bring Cressida,’ a source at Balmoral tells me. ‘It is the talk of the estate.’

Good company: Cressida Bonas' maternal second great grandmother, Lady Georgiana Spencer-Churchill, was Winston Churchill's aunt. Miss Bonas is believed to have been in a relationship with Prince Harry since 2012

Visits to the Queen’s 49,000-acre home in the Highlands are a rite of passage for any royal bride-to-be.

Kate Middleton and her parents were invited to join Prince William on a private shooting party at Balmoral in October 2010.

William and Kate’s engagement was announced the following month.

The Middletons spent the weekend at Birkhall, Prince Charles’s private residence on the Balmoral estate, which is where Cressida is expected to stay with Harry.

William and Kate cemented their relationship at Balmoral, where they were given use of a cottage to spend weekends together while they were students at St Andrews University.

Last Friday, Cressida attended her first public engagement with Harry, at the WE Day UK youth event at Wembley Arena.

While the couple have been secretive in the past, arriving separately at parties, this time they were happy to be photographed cuddling and displaying open signs of affection.

Yesterday they were pictured enjoying the rugby at Twickenham. The daughter of businessman Jeffrey Bonas and the aristocratic former model Lady Mary Gaye Curzon has been courting Harry for almost two years.

Their relationship survived the Prince’s four-month posting to Afghanistan.

Last October, it was reported that Cressida had finally overcome her reservations about marrying into the Royal Family.

‘Cressie is going to marry Harry,’ one of her friends told a broadsheet newspaper. ‘Harry never stops talking about marriage and children, and she has now got used to the idea. The wedding is likely to take place next year.’

The Prince turns 30 in September and many of his closest friends are now married or engaged.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman says: ‘We would never comment on any private engagements.’

A source close to Cressida tells me: ‘I think it is too early in the year for a formal invitation to have been made.’
