Britain's most famous locomotive is celebrating its 80th anniversary since becoming the first ever train to travel at over 100mph.

A stunning set of pictures of the Flying Scotsman have now been released to mark its world record breaking journey on November 30,  1934, as it travelled between Edinburgh and London.

The London North and Eastern Railway, LNER, locomotive's speed hit triple digits on the downwards slope of Stoke Bank near Grantham, when it officially became the fastest train in the world.

Photographs show the A3 Gresley Pacific, a class of locomotive built by LNER, in all its glory and feature driver William Sparshatt, aged 61 at the time, on the day the landmark journey took place as he guided the train between London and Edinburgh.

Sir Nigel Gresley had designed the steam train after the LNER asked him to help them find a new way to take passengers from the capital to Newcastle in four hours instead of buying a German diesel-powered 'Flying Hamburger'.

Built in Doncaster in 1923, the locomotive was named the 'Flying Scotsman' after the London to Edinburgh rail service which had been running since 1862, and was the first train to complete the 392-mile route non-stop on May 1, 1928.

The locomotive was the first train to reach 100mph and also the first to complete the 392-mile London to Edinburgh route non-stop on May 1, 1928

Arguably the world's most famous train, the Flying Scotsman has been restored and studied extensively, as can be seen here where scientific research is carried out onboard in 1931

Since then it has had various owners including record producer Pete Waterman, and has toured the United States and Australia where it set its second world record, for the longest non-stop run by a steam locomotive.

The Flying Scotsman made a special charter journey in 2005 also captured in the pictures before being moved to the National Railway Museum in York for complete restoration.  

Paul Kirkman, Director of the National Railway Museum, said: 'We are now progressing full steam ahead towards completing the restoration.

'We are showcasing British engineering genius, with our Mallard 75 Great Goodbye celebration at Locomotion; the National Railway Museum at Shildon next month so it's great that we can announce good news regarding another Gresley-designed icon. 

It served for 39 years before being decommissioned from scheduled service in 1963 after it had clocked up more than two million miles.

The flagship locomotive had its first taste of fame at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 before it was selected for the prestigious London to Edinburgh service.

When British Railways decided to scrap the train in in 1963, a campaign group called 'Save Our Scotsman' attempted to raise the money to buy the Flying Scotsman. The group failed and it was instead bought by railway preservationist Alan Pegler who restored it to 1930s condition, before he famously took it on a tour of the United States, supported by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, for which it was fitted with a bell, headlamp and cowcatcher.

When Pegler was hit by financial issues, British businessman William McAlpine bought the Flying Scotsman and toured Australia between 1988-9 it, where the train broke its second world record, for the longest ever non-stop run by a steam locomotive,  when it ran 422 miles (679 km) on 8 August 1989.

The locomotive was to change hands several times again but in 2004, following a successful campaign, Flying Scotsman was returned to public ownership when it was purchased by the National Railways Museum.

As part of ongoing restorations, it was moved to Bury last year and engineers working on the locomotive hope it will be ready for action on modern British train tracks in summer 2015.
