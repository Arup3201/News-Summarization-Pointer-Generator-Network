The family of a 20-year-old British waitress allegedly beaten to death by her boyfriend in Crete today watched as he was given leave to return home to the UK.

Luke Walker, 24, from Brierley Hill, 
near Dudley, West Midlands, is accused of attacking girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman, inflicting fatal injuries.

His previous bail conditions stated that he must remain on the island, but he was today told he could await the next stage in his trial at home - because judges in Greece are on strike.

Downcast: Walker, right, will present 11 witnesses to the court in an effort to prove his girlfriend died from a fall rather than from him attacking her

His family looked emotional and some burst into tears as they heard the news at Heraklion Mixed Court today.

Walker denies murder and claims that Ms Hyndman, of Castleford, West Yorkshire,  
fell after a night out in the resort town of Malia, Crete, where 
they both lived and worked in bars.

The 20-year-old waitress died after she was admitted to hospital in Heraklion with abdominal pains in May 2010.

Two post-mortem examinations have been carried out on her body, evidence from which is expected to play a key role in the trial.

After the four jurors were sworn in today, Walker spoke through an interpreter to confirm his identity.

He gave his occupation as 'electrician' and told the three judges he lived in Stalis, a coastal resort in Crete.

The court sat for less than an hour before adjourning because key prosecution witnesses had not been summoned.

Many of the witnesses in the case had flown in from Britain. Ms Hyndman's mother, Heather, and her family sat in the front rows of the public gallery.

Walker's solicitor, George Pyromallis, asked that the defendant be allowed to return to England on bail.

The 24-year-old has spent the last two-and-a-half years in Crete, initially on remand for five months before he was granted bail at on the condition he did not leave the island.

Speaking after the hearing, Walker said it was the 'best outcome so far'.

He said: 'I expected the trial to go ahead today - I thought this would be it now.

'I haven't even thought about what I'll do when I get home. It hasn't crossed my mind.

'I'm actually feeling a bit scared about it but it's amazing news.

'All I want to do is clear my name. It's been a nightmare; horrible. Work has been difficult, I can't get jobs.

'But my family and friends have been amazing and really supported me. I can't thank them enough.'

Walker said he was 'chuffed' to be coming home, and paid tribute to the girlfriend he is accused of beating to death - saying she was the 'love of my life.'

'I had fully prepared myself to fight my case - but I'm chuffed that I'll be going home,' he said.

'I haven't felt safe here since my arrest. I've been stuck in a prison cell where nobody speaks English.

'There were about 18 people in a 10 man cell, and I had to climb over people to even get to a toilet. It's been hell.

Nights out: Walker said he had been in 'hell' since Ms Hyndman's death, and that she was the 'love of his life'

'It has been such a mental battle to deal with all this. Chelsea was the love of my life and I'm determined to protest my innocence in court.

'But right now, all I want to do is go back home. I came to Crete to enjoy the sun and sand - I never thought I could miss the Black Country so much.'

He will return to Brierley Hill with his family and may work in the family's electrical business.

His parents, who have been regularly visiting him at his apartment in Crete, said they were relieved at the development.

'I'm just so glad he's going home,' said his father, Patrick. 'But to know it's not over and we still have the trial to come is hard.

'It's going to be hard for Luke too. He hasn't been to England in two-and-a-half years so it'll take some settling in.'

He added that the family will return home from Stalis, a 25-minute drive from Heraklion, as soon as bail has been arranged.

Ms Hyndman's family left without speaking to the media.

The first stage of the trial was 
originally scheduled for today and tomorrow, but a strike by Greek 
judges reduced it to a day, with a date for further hearings yet to be 
set.

Judges will be on strike each day in 
Greece until October 31 as industrial action continues across the 
country, with metro workers and doctors also staging walkouts in protest
at Government cuts. 

Walker
intends to present 11 witnesses as he tries to disprove the 
prosecution’s claims that Ms Hyndman's injuries were caused after he 
flew into a fit of jealous rage.

Last night Ms Hyndman's mother said the loss of her daughter has left a horrendous gap in her life.

Place in the sun: Ms Hyndman's mother Heather said no verdict could ever bring her daughter back

Mrs Hyndman, 47, also from Castleford, said no verdict could ever bring her daughter back.

'She
just loved life, loved her friends, loved going out at the weekends, 
going to work, going to the gym, driving lessons, a typical 
20-year-old,' she told BBC Look North.

'Every
morning I wake up and I know that I am not going to be able to see her 
and touch her and then I just tell myself, "you can get through this 
day".

'If you do manage to laugh then you feel guilty because how can you be feeling happy when your daughter is not with you?

'It's just the worst thing that could possibly happen to a mother.'

She said she has had tremendous support from family and friends and is reassured that the case will be heard by a judge.
