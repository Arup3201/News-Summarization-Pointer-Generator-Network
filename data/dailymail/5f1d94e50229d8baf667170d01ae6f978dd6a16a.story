President Obama today defended his administration’s slow response to reports of chemical weapon use in Syria, in spite of his earlier promises that the use of such weapons would be considered ‘crossing a red line’.

The President said at a press conference on Tuesday that ‘there is a whole host of steps that we've been taking’ but he did not specifically say whether his administration would be prepared to take military action against Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

He said the war-torn country is ‘a blemish on the international community.’

Pausing: President Obama said that there are a 'host of options' for how the U.S. reacts to news of Syria using chemical weapons though they have not determined whether they will or not

‘Generally when you use these kinds of weapons, you have the potential of killing massive numbers of people in the most inhumane way possible,’ Obama said.

‘We don’t want that genie out of the bottle.’

Photos and videos of civilians were released online last week that reportedly showed victims of chemical weapons attacks in Aleppo.

The President said that his administration is still working to establish a ‘chain of custody’ for the weapons used in the attacks, as he says it is unclear exactly who fired them.

‘We don't know when they were used, how they were used. We don't know who used them,’ Obama said.

‘If we end up rushing to judgement without hard effective evidence... there may be objections even among some who are sympathetic with the opposition in the region.

‘By game changer I mean we would have the rethink the range of options that are available to us. Like I said we're already invested in trying to find a solution that is available in Syria.’

He said that his military teams have been compiling ‘a spectrum of options’ in terms of possible American use of force in the region since ‘as early as last year’ but they are still evaluating their plan.

Addressing the issue: Tuesday's press conference was the first made by the President since the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday but relations seemed tense

The talk covered a wide range of issues, including his approval of the FBI’s work both leading up to and in response to the Boston Marathon bombings, his continued disapproval of Guantanamo Bay prison camp, and the sequester.

He took the opportunity to reassure Americans in the wake of the April 15 bombing, saying that one of the things he was ‘most proud of’ following the attack was the resilience that he saw in Bostonians.

‘You don’t get a sense that anybody's intimidated when they go to Fenway Park a couple of days after the bombing,’ he said.

He defended the work of the FBI, even though they have been subject to criticism following the revelation that both the FBI and the CIA had the elder suspect, Tamerlan Tsarnaev on terrorist watchlists but he was allowed to re-enter the country following six months abroad where it is believed that he may have become more radicalized.

‘It’s not as if the FBI did nothing: they not only investigated the older brother they interviewed the older brother. The question then is is there something that happened that triggered radicalization.

Search: President Obama said that investigators had identified the perpetrators 'hours' after they secured the Marathon crime scene on Monday, but the photo of the suspects was not released until Thursday

‘Are there additional things that could have been done in that interim that could have prevented? We won’t know that until that review is completed.

‘Based on what I’ve seen so far, the FBI performed its duties, the Department of Homeland Security did what it is supposed to be doing, but this is hard stuff.’

He said that Russian intelligence forces have been cooperating fully with the investigation, though the relationship between the two countries is still frosty, as a residual side effect of the Cold War.

'You know, obviously, old habits die hard. There are still suspicions sometimes between our intelligence and law enforcement agencies that date back 10, 20, 30 years, back to the Cold War. But they're continually improving,' he said.

'I've spoken to President Putin directly. He's committed to working with me to make sure that those who report to us are cooperating fully in not only this investigation but how do we work on counter-terrorism issues generally.'

On the agenda: President Obama said that the continued usage of Guantanamo Bay prison camp is hurting American credibility abroad and is being used as a recruitment tool for terrorists

President Obama also said that another factor hurting our ability to fight terrorism is the continued usage of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, where prisoners are currently holding a hunger strike to show their disgust with their treatment.

'I don't want these individuals to die...all of us should reflect on why are we doing this? Why are we doing this?' Obama said.

'I think it is critical for us to understand that Guantanamo is not necessary to keep America safe. It is expensive. It is inefficient. It hurts us in terms of our international standing. It lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts. It is a recruitment tool for extremists. It needs to be closed.' 

Facing the critics: President Obama has been criticized for not speaking to the press and holding the fewest conferences of many recent presidents, so he took an hour on Tuesday to address that point

The press conference was the first that the President held since the White House Correspondents’ Dinner on Saturday night, where funny speeches were used to show a lighter relationship between the White House and the press.

The weekend revelry evaporated during one tense moment when reporter Jonathan Karl asked the President if he had enough ‘juice’ to get through the rest of his term, even though a number of his initiatives- including the gun control bill- have been overturned in the first 100 days of his second term.

‘If you put it that way Jonathan maybe I should just pack up and go home, golly,’ the President said jokingly.

‘As Mark Twain said “rumors of my demise may be a little exaggerated at this point.”’

The last question of the conference was taken on the fly as he was headed out of the briefing room, when someone asked his thoughts on the revelation that basketball player Jason Collins is gay.

'I had a chance to talk to him yesterday. He seems like a terrific young man, and, you know, I told him I couldn't be prouder of him,' President Obama said.

'Given the importance of sports in our society, for an individual who's excelled at the highest levels in one of major sports go ahead and say, this is who I am, I'm proud of it, I'm still a great competitor, I'm still seven feet tall and can bang with Shaq and, you know, deliver a hard foul -- and for, you know, a lot of young people out there who, you know, are -- are -- are, you know, gay or lesbian, who are struggling with these issues, to see a role model like that who's unafraid, I think it's a great thing.'
