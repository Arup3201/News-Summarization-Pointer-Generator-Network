William Dresser has been arrested for attempted murder after police say he shot his elderly wife in the chest while she lay in hospital

An 88-year-old man allegedly shot his elderly wife in the chest while she was lying in a hospital bed.

According to police William Dresser, 88, walked into the rehab unit of Carson Tahoe Regional Medical Center, Nevada, yesterday morning before shooting his wife once in the chest with a pistol.

Dresser was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and has been placed on suicide watch by officers.

His wife, who has not been identified, suffered life-threatening injuries and was transferred to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno.

No details of why she was originally admitted to the hospital were released, but officials don't suspect foul play.

Dresser's wife was alone in the rehab unit when allegedly he carried out the attack around 11.30am.

The hospital was placed into a state of lockdown while hospital security personnel and state Department of Corrections officials detained the man until sheriff's deputies arrived.

Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong said that Dresser, who recently bought the gun, has no previous criminal record in the Carson City area. Dresser's bail has been set at $225,000.

The shooting comes about a month after a gunman walked into a medical facility next to the Reno hospital and killed one doctor and shot another before committing suicide.

Alan Oliver Frazier, 51, made it clear in a suicide note that he was targeting physicians at Urology Nevada in the Dec. 17 attack.

Frazier complained of pain and fatigue for years in an Internet chat room and to neighbors- symptoms he blamed on a botched vasectomy that the center disputes.
