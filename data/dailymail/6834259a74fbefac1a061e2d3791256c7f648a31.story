A career criminal sobbed in the dock yesterday as he was jailed for the brutal murder of a war veteran in his own bed.

Daniel Crompton, 24, broke into the home of widower Frank Worsley, 87, and demanded to know where he kept his money.

When the terrified pensioner said he didn’t have any cash, Crompton took off his T-shirt, wrapped it around his fist and beat him  savagely around the head.

Terror: Daniel Crompton, left, has been sentenced to life in prison over the killing of Frank Worsley, right 

Mr Worsley was left badly injured  and told police he was ‘shocked and frightened’ by the ferocity of the attack.

Later
 that day the veteran, who served with the Royal Navy Medical Corps, 
suffered a bleed on the brain and was taken to hospital where he later 
died.

Yesterday Crompton, a
 drug user who had clocked up 42 previous convictions since the age of 
14, was jailed for 18 years at Manchester Crown Court.

Passing
 sentence, Mr Justice Turner told him: ‘You neither knew nor cared 
whether the house was occupied. All you cared about was your craving for
 further cocaine.

Couple: Mr Worsley spent 25 years nursing his wife Mary through her battle with multiple sclerosis 

‘The attack was as brutal as it was cowardly.  

‘When
 Mr Worsley was on his way to hospital, you were busily spending his 
money.’ The jury heard Mr Worsley, a grandfather and father of two, had 
lived alone since the death of his wife, Mary, in 2012.

On August 3 last year he awoke to the terrifying sight of Crompton standing over him and demanding he hand over money.

The court was told the drug-addicted father of one had needed money to buy cocaine and pay off debts from payday loans.

He
 had been to a party, drunk lager and snorted cocaine and was said to be
 ‘wired and excited’ when he left to carry out the raid on the 
vulnerable elderly man.

Home: Crompton broke in to Mr Worsley terraced house in Bolton and stole £85 to buy cocaine 

Even
 after being beaten Mr Worsley bravely refused to comply with Crompton’s
 demands, so the intruder snatched a wallet and chequebook and fled – 
leaving his palm print on a window frame.

Jurors
 looked visibly shocked as Mr Worsley’s frantic 999 call was played to 
the court, in which he begged the operator: ‘Help me please.  

‘He’s 
hit me and beaten me and attacked me and taken my wallet.’

Later in 
hospital, medical staff decided against surgery for the bleed on his 
brain because he had been taking the anticoagulant drug warfarin for a 
heart complaint and operating would have been too dangerous.

Beloved: Mr Worsley's family paid tribute to him after his murderer was sentenced to life in prison

He
 was taken off the drug in the hope it would help but he suffered a 
stroke on August 7 and died on August 20. The jury heard Mr Worsley was a
 former Sunday school teacher and amateur operatics enthusiast.

After
 leaving the Navy he worked in several jobs before taking retirement so 
he could care full-time for his wife, Mary, who suffered from multiple 
sclerosis.  

They were 
married for 62 years and he nursed her for 25 years until her death in 
September 2012. He had fitted extra locks at their Bolton terraced house
 after a previous burglary in 2010.

Crompton
 claimed the pensioner had been injured during a tussle between the pair
 but a jury took six hours to find him guilty of murder by a majority 
verdict of 10-2.

He sobbed 
in the dock when the verdict was returned and shouted, ‘I hope you’re 
pleased with yourselves’ at the jury as he was  led away.

His girlfriend Beverley Hardman, 25, of Bolton, is accused of helping Crompton evade police and faces a trial in May.

Mr
 Worsley’s family said in a statement: ‘We could be more accepting of 
his death if it had been of old age, peaceful and dignified. Instead it 
wasn’t peaceful, he wasn’t comfortable, he was scared, agitated and 
distressed as a result of this callous attack.’
