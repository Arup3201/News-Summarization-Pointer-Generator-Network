Javier Manquillo was forced to belly-slide along the floor of Liverpool's Melwood dining room after losing a bet to Jose Enrique.

The former Newcastle man posted a video of the young full back carrying out the forfeit on his Instagram account.

Enrique wrote: 'Thanks #manquillo. This is what happens when you bet against me on ping pong or fifa any of them.'

Manquillo played the full 90 minutes as Liverpool got back to winning ways in the Capital One Cup with a 2-1 win over Swansea.

Brendan Rodgers must have feared the worst when his side went behind mid-way through the second half, but goals from Mario Balotelli and Dejan Lovren turned the result on its head, and earned the hosts their first win in three games.

Next up for Liverpool is a trip to a resurgent Newcastle, who beat Tottenham in their last Premier League outing.
