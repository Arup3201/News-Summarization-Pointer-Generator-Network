Princess Beatrice looked happy and relaxed as she continued her social summer at Royal Ascot with sister Eugenie by her side.

Although she hasn't always won plaudits 
for her style, Beatrice looked stunning in an embellished navy dress and
a neat gold fascinator.

Eugenie, meanwhile, plumped for a silver 
pillbox hat by milliner Nerida Fraiman, which she teamed with a turquoise
dress andÂ  a cream jacket.

Lovely: Princess Beatrice, meanwhile, arrived with a radiant Princess Royal who was pretty in eau de nil

Elegant: Princess Eugenie arrived in a carriage with the Duke and Duchess of Argyll and the Hon. Hugo Palmer

Fun: The sisters then spent time in the paddock checking the form before heading to the Royal Box

The sisters have had a busy summer with both Beatrice and Eugenie joining the rest of the royal family at Trooping the 
Colour last week and at the coronation celebrations the week before.

But they seemed to have the most fun at Ascot where they watched the racing accompanied by their father, the Duke of York.

The Queen, in a deep purple coat and matching hat, also looked in good spirits as she watched the racing with her eldest grandson Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn, dressed fashionably in a green bodycon dress with a large-brimmed cream hat.

But the real surprise of the afternoon came when the Queen's thoroughbred filly Estimate, an 80th birthday present from the Aga Khan, romped home to take the Gold Cup - much to the delight of the monarch and her two cheering granddaughters.

An ecstatic Beatrice could be seen jumping for joy as the horse thundered past to win, while Eugenie beamed as she watched the race come to a dramatic conclusion.

Relaxed: Princess Beatrice looked happy and at ease - despite the presence of four large bay horses

Later, the pair could be seen smiling and laughing as their father presented their grandmother with the gleaming gold trophy.

Also with the royal party was Princess Anne who looked wonderful in pale eau de nil silk and a matching hat.

She joined Princess Beatrice for the traditional horse-drawn parade along the Ascot racecourse, while Princess Eugenie rode with the Duke and Duchess of Argyll and the Hon. Hugo Palmer.

Jubilant: The twosome then roared the Queen's horse Estimate onto victory in the Gold Cup

Victory! The princesses are elated as the horse romps home to take the trophy by a length

But one person was even happier: The Queen looked thrilled to see Estimate win the Gold Cup
