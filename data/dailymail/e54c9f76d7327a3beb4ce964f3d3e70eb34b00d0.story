A disabled 92-year-old was battered to death by her own granddaughter after the pensioner found out she was stealing her life savings.

Daisy Myring was found crying on her bedroom floor after Sheila Jones had attacked her with a stool.

The widow died hours later. Yesterday Jones, 36, stood impassively in the dock as she was jailed for life after admitting murder.

The mother of two – who wore a 
crucifix in court – had launched the attack hours before Mrs Myring was 
due to visit her building society over suspicions Jones had been raiding
her account.

The pensioner, who was registered 
blind and had a heart condition, had four visits a day from professional
carers, but Jones helped to look after her at her home in Brownhills, 
West Midlands. Prosecutor Gareth Walters said Jones was entrusted with 
access to Mrs Myring’s building society account.

She ‘frittered’ away £7,200 of the widow’s money on a TV, a holiday and gifts for her two children.

By the time of her death in May, a year after the thefts started, Mrs Myring had just £48 to her name.

Mr Walters said Jones had gone to her grandmother’s house during the night with a torch and a pillow, intending to smother her.

‘She was hoping to put it down to 
Daisy’s poor heart’, he said. But ‘something went wrong,’ and when the 
pensioner resisted, Jones picked up the plastic stool.

Home: Jones's house in Norton Canes, Staffordshire. She has been sentenced to life imprisonment

In a ‘frenzied and ferocious’ attack, 
Jones smashed the chair over Mrs Myring’s head, punched and kicked her 
and attempted to strangle her.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard that 
Mrs Myring, who relied on a pacemaker, was found conscious by a carer 
the morning after she was attacked, but was so dazed she could not 
identify her attacker.

She was severely injured, with five 
large cuts to her head, a bruise the size of a fist on her face, a 
broken collarbone, a dislocated shoulder, fractured rib and extensive 
bruising on her neck. She died later in hospital.

Mr Walters said Jones was arrested in the aftermath of the attack but claimed her grandmother had loaned her £6,000.

She was released on bail due to a lack
of evidence but was rearrested when, ‘by chance’, a police patrol car 
saw her walking in a country lane carrying two bin liners.

The black sacks contained the broken stool and clothing and a pillow spattered with her victim’s blood.

The bags had been left on open ground,
but Jones, from Norton Canes, Staffordshire, had gone to retrieve them 
after becoming ‘frightened’ by reports police were due to search the 
area. Sentencing, Judge Phillip Parker QC told Jones: ‘You killed the 
person you were entrusted with looking after.

‘Taking her savings was callous and cruel but taking her life was unforgivable.

‘You deprived her of a peaceful end to her life and you deprived her of leaving her precious savings to those she wished.’

He gave Jones a life sentence and ordered that she serve a minimum term of 22-and-a-half years.

Detective Inspector Simon Astle from West Midlands Police said the motive for the crime was simple greed.

David Worrall, the victim’s grandson and Jones’s brother, said his family was ‘delighted’ by the sentence.
