Thousands of anti-gay protesters, including Orthodox priests, picketed a gay pride parade in Georgia today, with some threatening to lash homosexual activists with stinging nettles.

Police in Tbilisi guarded several dozen gay activists and bused them out of the city center shortly after they arrived at the gathering.

In extraordinary scenes that saw chaos spread through the capital, those occupying the street held posters reading 'We don't need Sodom and Gomorrah!' and 'Democracy does not equal immorality!'

A number of protesters carrying bunches of stinging nettles threatened to use them on gay activists. They insist that homosexuality runs against Georgia's traditional Orthodox Christian values.

Father David, a priest who was one of the organizers of Friday's anti-gay rally, said the parade 'insults people's traditions and national sentiments.'

A gay rally in Tbilisi last year was also short-lived and ended in a scuffle.

Georgia's authorities had given the green light for the gay parade to take place, saying that all Georgian citizens, irrespective of their sexuality, are entitled to voice their views in public.

'We are against the propaganda of homosexuality,' 21-year-old student Nikolai Kiladze said.

'Deplorable': Those occupying the street held posters and placards reading 'We don't need Sodom and Gomorrah!' and 'Democracy does not equal immorality!'

Love is love: Georgia is one of only few countries in the former Soviet bloc that directly prohibits discrimination against homosexuality in law - but in an ultra Orthodox Christian country gay people are nonetheless targeted by vigilantes

'If we need to allow parades like this in order to become a member of the European Union or other Western organizations and blocs, then I'm against joining these organizations.'

Georgia's human rights ombudsman, Uchi Nanuashvili, said it is 'deplorable' that gay people's constitutional rights were violated on Rustavi Street on Friday.

Georgia is one of only few countries in the former Soviet bloc that directly prohibits discrimination against homosexuality in law.

Nevertheless, in a highly traditional Orthodox Christian country, where public discussions of sexuality in general tend to be shunned and ignored, homosexuality is considered a major deviation from  the norm.

As a result, gay people are often targets of abuse and physical violence.
