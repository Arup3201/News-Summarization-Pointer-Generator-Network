A Minnesota man has admitted to shooting his wife, sawing her body into pieces and hiding her remains in plastic bins in a friend's garage after she threatened to leave him and take their toddler.

Steven Roger Johnson, 34, of St. Paul, is charged with second-degree murder after prosecutors say he shot his wife, Manya Jewel Johnson, 32, in the head before trying to dispose of her body in the presence of their 18-month-old son.

Johnson told police he had been drinking when he shot his wife in the head on Sunday and 'used a saw to dismember her body in the shower and he placed her in several plastic bins,' the criminal complaint read.

Johnson said he then cleaned up his home to hide any evidence and took the bins to his unsuspecting friend's garage in the St. Paul suburb of White Bear Lake.

The friend didn't know what had happened until Johnson told him later, and the friend called authorities.

Johnson was in custody on Wednesday and unavailable for comment. It was unclear if he had an attorney.

According to the charges, St. Paul police went to the Johnson home on Monday to check on Manya Johnson when she failed to show up for work.

When officers arrived, they were told that White Bear Lake police had received a call from Johnson's friend, who reported that Johnson told him Manya Johnson was dead after slipping in the shower, a neighbour told the Post Bulletin.

Violent past: Johnson, seen at the age of 18, was previously convicted of felony criminal sexual conduct in 1996 that imprisoned him from December of 1996 until February of 2008

He then admitted to hiding her body in
his garage but asked for help renting a storage unit for its holding, 
according to the source who asked not to be named.

While
St. Paul police were at Johnson's home, he showed up with a woman who 
worked with Manya Johnson, and they both told police they were looking 
for Manya.

Johnson told police he had left his job to look for his wife after getting a text message saying she hadn't shown up for work.

Manya's co-worker and Johnson told police they found her car at a park-and-ride lot.

As
an officer was talking with Johnson, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal 
Apprehension called the officer and said authorities had found the 
dismembered body.

Johnson was then arrested, the complaint said.

'This
horrific crime is an unfortunate example of how quickly domestic 
violence can turn into homicide,' Ramsey County Attorney John Choi said 
in a statement.

Johnson was convicted of first-degree 
criminal sexual conduct in 1996, after he and an accomplice allegedly 
handcuffed a stranger in a car and raped her.

Authorities alleged Johnson threatened to kill the woman and claimed he had a gun.

He was on supervised release until 2018.

When
the couple moved into the neighbourhood in 2010, neighbour Cherste 
Eidman told the Bulletin that she did her best to look past Johnson’s 
criminal history, with him being a registered sex offender.

‘My husband and I, we put a card in their mailbox that said, “We know about your past, but we believe in second chances, and it sounds like you've done your time. We welcome you to the neighborhood,”’ Mrs Eidman said. ‘That night, Manya and Steve showed up at our doorstep, holding the card and almost in tears. They said, “Thank you, thank you for reaching out to us.”’

He is being held on $2,000,000 bail.
