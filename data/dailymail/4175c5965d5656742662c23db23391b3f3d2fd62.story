Click here for Sportsmail's brilliant Match Zone from Everton's draw with Swansea

Swansea manager Garry Monk allowed himself a wry smile just 24 hours after clear-the-air talks with refereeing bosses Mike Riley and Howard Webb. His influential midfielder, Jonjo Shelvey, had just been sent off and his side were also denied a clear penalty.

Monk, 35, is the Premier League’s youngest manager but he certainly is not backward in coming forwards.

He met Riley and Webb on Friday two weeks after a ‘cheat’ outburst against Stoke City’s Victor Moses and then professed himself satisfied with the chat.

‘I had a good meeting with Mike and Howard and got a bit of clarification,’ he said. ‘We were having a lot of wrong decisions in a short period that was hurting us.’

On Saturday's two major talking points, Monk did not offer any defence on behalf of Shelvey, who received a yellow card for foolishly kicking the ball away and then a second for grappling with James McCarthy as the Everton midfielder burst towards the penalty area.

But he was incredulous that Antolin Alcaraz’s handball to block Shelvey’s shot in the first half had not been spotted by referee Kevin Friend.

‘I didn’t know you could play with two goalkeepers,’ he smiled. ‘He [Alcaraz] actually saved the ball. It was a good strong wrist. I’ll be showing my goalkeepers that’s how you do it. It was a clear penalty.

‘I’m not particularly complaining about the sending off. You can’t kick the ball away for the first yellow, it is something he [Shelvey] needs to learn from. But the way things are going for us at the moment, any time we make contact on a yellow card, it then becomes a red.

‘But we have to help ourselves get over the periods where the odd 50-50 goes against us. And we did that today — defensively we were brilliant.’

Roberto Martinez cut his managerial teeth at Swansea and set down the template for slick passing and good attacking movement. But after managerial stints by Brendan Rodgers and Michael Laudrup, Monk, a former centre-half, has improved Swansea’s defensive qualities

He was proud of the way his players threw their bodies in the path of the ball on countless occasions to block out an Everton side trying to make their extra man count in the final 18 minutes.

‘I’ve played in many Swansea teams that played attractive football but sometimes we didn’t do enough work defensively. It is something I brought in. There are times where we can’t play free-flowing football and if we hadn’t done that work on our shape, we would have lost games like this.’

Martinez was not flattering about what he saw from his former club.

‘There were organised but that’s not what you’d normally highlight from a Swansea team. It was strange to see them play like that.’

It smacked of our sour grapes and perhaps Martinez is concerned his own side have just one Premier League win at Goodison Park this season.

True, Swansea did not have a shot on target but they deserved a penalty and had the game’s clearest chance when Wilfried Bony shot wide after being put clean through by Gylfi Sigurdsson.

Everton’s game was more about half-chances. Aiden McGeady’s shot was saved by Lukasz Fabianski and Leighton Baines fired wide with a free-kick.

They did press more right at the end but Romelu Lukaku, on the bench until the final quarter, inadvertently blocked Baines’s shot in added time and then failed to get a touch on a Samuel Eto’o cross.

‘The way we moved the ball wasn’t quick enough,’ admitted the Everton manager. ‘Swansea defended well, you have to give them credit. But we had bad fortune, too. Leighton had a good angle at the end but his shot hit Romelu’s legs.’

Martinez was also disappointed to see Alcaraz leave the action clutching his shoulder. He faces another prolonged spell on the sidelines after falling badly as he challenged Bony in the air.

‘He has damaged his joint in the shoulder and he is going to be out for a long spell. It is a real negative for us,’ said Martinez.

Shelvey, 22, might have feared he had cost his side the game when he was ordered off 18 minutes from the end.

He has already picked up 22 bookings and two red cards in his short career and, as an ex-Liverpool player, he was booed all the way to the dressing-room by Everton fans.

But his team-mates did him proud as they kept Everton at bay.

Martinez said: ‘I’m disappointed as I thought it was going to be more of a spectacle but it didn’t turn out to be. I thought we were a little frustrated.’

Thanks to his players’ resilience, Monk could afford to let the officials off this time. ‘I have just told my players they will never win a harder-earned point,’ he said.
