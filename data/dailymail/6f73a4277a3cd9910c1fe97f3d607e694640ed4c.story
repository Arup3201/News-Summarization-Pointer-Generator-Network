Bayern Munich maintained their unbeaten start to the season after hammering Werder Bremen 6-0 at the Allianz Arena in the German top flight.

With winger Franck Ribery making his comeback as a substitute on the hour, league leaders Bayern were in complete control with Philipp Lahm and Xabi Alonso giving them an early two-goal cushion.

With Werder unable to counter the Bavarian attacks, a 43rd-minute penalty from Thomas Muller and Mario Gotze's shot two minutes later killed off the game before half-time.

Lahm and Gotze got their second goals of the afternoon in the second half to lift Bayern to 20 points, four ahead of second-placed Borussia Monchengladbach, who eased past Hanover 96 3-0 with two goals from forward Max Kruse.

Ribery's return came with the French midfielder having only played 22 minutes this season following a knee problem, but the 31-year-old was eased into action with the German champions already 4-0 up by the time he replaced Arjen Robben.

By contrast the defeat for Bremen left them rock bottom of the Bundesliga after eight games with Robin Dutt's team yet to win a league game this term.
