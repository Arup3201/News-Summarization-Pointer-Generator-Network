Jodi Arias was sentenced to life behind bars today after a jury failed to reach a verdict on whether to execute her for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander - causing his distraught sister to break down in tears and wish Arias to 'burn in hell'.

The harrowing scene played out in Maricopa Country Superior Court as Judge Sherry Stephens declared a mistrial meaning Arias, 34, would not be able to face the death penalty.

Tanisha Sorenson was overcome with grief and held her face in her hand as other members of Alexander's family wept while a shackled Arias looked on impassively as she escaped with her life.

Speaking to the media afterwards, a furious Sorensen said, 'The real justice will be in the afterlife when Jodi burns in hell.' 

It is now up to the judge to decide if Arias gets 25-years to-life with parole or without parole and Stephens told the court she would announce this in April.

Arias' mother, Sandra, broke down too and received a hug from a friend.

It is the second time a jury has failed to decide on life or death for Arias, 34, and under Arizona state law she cannot be tried again - a sore disappointment for the prosecution who have always sought execution.

Indeed, it was revealed afterwards that jurors who deadlocked on punishment for convicted murderer Jodi Arias say they were split 11-1 in favor of the death penalty and that they tried unsuccessfully to get the lone dissenter, a woman, kicked off the panel.

Fourteen jurors, including at least one alternate and one woman removed from the panel earlier, talked to reporters Thursday after the verdict. None of them would reveal their names.

Many of the jurors said Arias lacked remorse and some said she tried to manipulate them.

Jurors also said they believed the holdout was biased and that the woman even had an agenda.

'The one holdout had her mind made up from the beginning,' a male juror said according to AZ Central.

'The 11 of us strived for justice, but to no avail,' another juror, who was also not identified, said. 'We absolutely feel the penalty should have been death.'

The Alexander family released a statement to say they are 'saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty. However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time.'

'Obviously, as I said, during the closing arguments, during the opening statements, and several times during the trial, that the events of June 4, 2008 were a tragedy, and the no verdict ultimately could repair that sadness. I don't think today's victory will repair any sadness or change anything but we hope it can begin the closure process for all those who were affected by that tragedy. Thank you,' Arias' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi told reporters Thursday. 

'Travis Alexander's surviving brothers and sisters Gary Alexander, Dennis "Greg" Alexander, Tanisha Sorenson, Samantha Alexander, Hillary Wilcox, Steven Alexander and Allie Iglesias are saddened by the jury's inability to reach a decision on the death penalty.

'However, they understand the difficulty of the decision, and have nothing but respect for the jury's time. They appreciate Deputy Count Attorney's Juan Martinez and appreciate the outpouring of support they have received from the public.

'Without the public's support, it would have been impossible for the family to attend trial over the past many years while the case worked its way through the justice system.

'The siblings request that their privacy be respected. They will not be making any further statements or participate in any interviews at this time.'

The controversial decision came after jurors deliberated for five days over the 2008 murder which Arias was found guilty of in 2013.

Arias, a 34-year-old former waitress from Salinas, California, was found guilty of the murder in 2013, but jurors at the original trial deadlocked on whether to give her the death penalty. 

Prosecutors accuse Arias of murdering her ex-partner, Travis Alexander, in a jealous rage, but she says she acted in self-defense. 

Alexander, 30, was found dead in a shower at his Phoenix-area home. 

He had been stabbed multiple times, his throat was cut almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face.

In closing statements, defense attorney Kirk Nurmi called for Arias' life to be spared, describing her as a remorseful and mentally ill woman who had been abused since childhood.

Prosecutor Juan Martinez accused Arias of acting in a cold and calculating way and said there were no factors preventing the jury from giving her the death penalty.

On Tuesday, the jury of eight women and four men were told by Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens to try harder to come to a decision, after apparently deadlocking.

Arias decided not to plead her case directly to the jury at the end of the sentencing retrial after Stephens denied the defendant's request that the courtroom be closed to the public and media during her comments.

The original trial in 2013 was broadcast live and drew a large audience with its gruesome crime scene photographs and sexually explicit testimony.

On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens denied a request by Arias' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial.

Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse, though the judge and prosecutor Juan Martinez never confirmed that in open court.

Jurors posed two questions to Stephens, who didn't reveal details. The judge and lawyers held closed-door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom.

Stephens told them that she didn't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors shouldn't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors.

If the current jury can't decide on a sentence, the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if Arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years.

Last week, Nurmi pleaded Arias' life, saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Alexander.

A judge declared a mistrial Thursday in the Jodi Arias sentencing case after a jury deadlocked on whether the convicted murderer should be executed or sent to prison for life for killing her lover in 2008.

Tragedy: Arias' 2013 trial became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with Alexander and that she shot him in the head and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated

Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'.

'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said.

Arias cried as prosecutor Juan Martinez displayed gruesome autopsy photographs of Alexander on a large screen during his closing argument.

Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim.

He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead.

'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.'

Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed.

So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation.
