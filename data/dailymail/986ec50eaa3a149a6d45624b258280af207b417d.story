An oil rig that no longer has any commercial value would usually be destined for the scrap heap, but not off the south-eastern coast of the Malaysian state of Sabah.

There stands a redundant rig that's been given a rebirth as a hotel haven for scuba divers keen for a unique holiday exploring the expansive wrecks and reefs next to the tiny Mabul Island.

Proud of its origin as a base for oil and gas exploration, Seaventures Dive Rig offers a direct route to stunning dive sites in the famed Coral Triangle. 

Seaventures Dive Rig  is a refurbished oil rig that was towed to the south-eastern coast off the Malaysian state of Sabah

The refurbished site is also has 27 fully-furnished rooms including twin shares and family rooms, as well as a dormitory 

The rig once served as accommodation element of oil rigs around various locations but was given a new lease on life when it was towed from a shipyard in Singapore to the south-eastern coast of the Malaysian state of Sabah.

The refurbished site is also has 27 fully-furnished rooms including twin shares and family rooms, as well as a dormitory. 

There is also more entertainment on offer than one would expect of what is effectively, now it's no longer a working rig, a tin shed in the middle of the ocean.

It has a movie room, a karaoke lounge and bar, pool tables, table tennis table, a souvenir shop and a conference room accommodating up to 60 people. It even has free wi-fi access.

They also host a weekly barbecue and offer live music in the form of the dive master's band, The Sea Gypsies. 

For time above the water, the resort offers has a movie room, a karaoke lounge and bar, and pool tables to keep guests entertained

Twin rooms are also available with all accommodation on the former oil rig enjoying air-conditioning

But it's really all about what goes on under water and the remarkably easy access to it, once you get there via boat transfer – there used to be a helipad for helicopter access but that’s now been converted into a sundeck.

A major feature of the rig is its elevator that takes divers directly into the reef underneath, which means no longer do divers have to lug their gear on and off a boat.

The lift also serves as the main platform for the hotel's 'Rig Jump', which as the name suggests is a chance for guests to leap into the crystal clear Celebes Sea from a height. The resort is still, however, deciding whether or not to make it a permanent fixture.

Being part of the Coral Triangle the area is teeming with sea life.

'A unique dive resort and the only one of its kind in the world, Seaventures still maintains the allure and spirit of a working rig yet the rooms are made more comfortable, the food highly acclaimed, service exemplary and diving world class.'

'It truly is a novelty alternative to any dive resort and best of all it is situated in one of the diving industry’s renowned dive destinations commonly ranked as being one of the world’s best.'

Those running the rig offer official PADI five-star IDC courses and the opportunity to get additional diving qualifications.
