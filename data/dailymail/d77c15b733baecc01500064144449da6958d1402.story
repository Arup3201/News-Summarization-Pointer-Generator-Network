Tottenham Hotspur are set to table an offer for Standard Liege striker Michy Batshuayi.

The Belgium Under 21 forward, 20, has been linked with Arsenal, Everton and Swansea already this summer and would be following in the footsteps of success stories such as Christian Benteke and Romelu Lukaku, who hit a hat-trick in the 5-1 friendly win over Luxembourg on Monday.

However, Spurs chief Daniel Levy is ready to make a bid for the highly-rated frontman, who has an £8million release clause, depending on Mauricio Pochettino’s approval.

Levy is confident of completing a deal for Pochettino, 42, to replace Tim Sherwood, preferring the Southampton boss to Ajax chief Frank de Boer.

Sportsmail revealed Tottenham’s intention to approach Pochettino on March 7.

The Argentine is expected to sign a three-year deal, worth up to £3.5million a year.

A condition of the managerial move is that Pochettino will be asked to conduct his media duties in English once he is appointed.

 McClaren, whose Derby side lost to QPR in the Championship play-off on 
Saturday, is in the frame to take over at Southampton.
