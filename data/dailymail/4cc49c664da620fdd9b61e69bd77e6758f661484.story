Celtic manager Ronny Deila called on Celtic fans to roar his team to the Champions League group stages after they secured a worthy 1-1 draw in Maribor.

Callum McGregor was the goal hero once again as he fired Celtic into a sixth-minute lead.

While Maribor punished slack defending and equalised through Danjan Bohar soon after, there was little prospect of a repeat of Celtic’s Warsaw capitulation which saw them ship four goals after McGregor had also given them the perfect start.

Now very much in the driving seat, Deila is relishing the prospect of the return leg of the play-off encounter and his first experience of a European night at Parkhead after the temporary home at Murrayfield.

‘That is one of the advantages, we play them at home and I saw on Saturday how much it means for the players,’ he said. ‘It is important now that people meet up and give us everything, the way Celtic Park is.

‘We have a big chance now.

‘The second leg is going to be a tough game. It could be that Maribor are more dangerous away than at home because they will play in the same way.

‘We have to play with the right balance and attack them the right way. But of course we have the advantage of playing at Celtic Park and that’s what we are going to use to get through to the group stages. I have a good feeling we can reach it.’

After being handed a shock reprieve in the competition thanks to Legia Warsaw’s administrative blunder, Celtic last night were a far more composed and controlled force than they had been in the 6-1 reverse to the Poles.

And Deila insisted his side were unfortunate not to travel back to Glasgow with a win.

‘I think we were closer to winning than they were,’ he said. ‘But I think the performance was good and we worked very hard for 90 minutes.

‘We got into the game in the right way so I am pleased. it is going to be very exciting to play them now at Celtic Park on Tuesday.

‘I am very pleased with the performance today. We were well prepared and we knew what we were going to meet. The players were fantastic for 90 minutes.

‘There are things to work on but we are looking like a team now. We are working hard and creating chances. 1-1 was a good result but I think we could have won the game.

‘We knew they were going to sit deep because we had seen a lot on video and you know what you can expect. They are very good on the counter attacks and they showed they are also good to go through the middle. But we kept them away for long periods and we created chances ourselves so I am happy today.’

Goal hero McGregor was singled out for special praise in what was a strong team performance. The 20-year-old, who spent last season on loan at Notts County, made it four goals in seven games after being given his first-team chance this season.

‘He is a fantastic player,’ Deila said. ‘He works both ways, good in defence and in offence so again a very good player and today he performed fantastic.

‘We can be proud he is a product of the Celtic youth department.’

At the other end, Craig Gordon also stood strong when Maribor threatened to take advantage of any slackness.

Blameless for the goal which came through weak defending on Celtic’s part, Deila said of his keeper: ‘You see every day the hunger he has and wants to get back to the level where he was. I think he is almost there now.

‘I believe he is an experienced keeper who is calm and knows how to focus and he is a leader in the group now. That is very important.

‘He is so calm when he stands in the goal, he is athletic so I am pleased with him as well today.’
