A gender non-conforming teenager from South Carolina is demanding to have a driver's license retaken after DMV staff barred him from wearing make up.

Chase Culpepper claims DMV staff said the make up should be removed because the teenager didn't look like how a boy should.

The 16-year-old, who wears androgynous clothing and make up, agreed to the staff's demands to get a license, but now wants to have the photo redone.

Upset: Chase wanted to have the license picture, above, retaken after he was forced to remove his make up

Denied: A request to let Chase, a gender non-conforming teenager, get a new picture has been turned down

Big day: Chase had been excited about applying for a driver's license, but left the DMV offices upset

Chase says staff claimed that DMV rules stated that the photo needed to show the person as they appear normally, and banned pictures taken in 'disguise'.

'This is who I am and my clothing and make-up reflect that,' Chase said. 'The Department of Motor Vehicles should
 not have forced me to remove my make-up simply because my appearance 
does not meet their expectations of what a boy should look like.'

Chase's mother, Teresa Culpepper, told WYFF4: 'They said he was wearing a disguise. It was very hurtful. He was absolutely devastated. That’s who he is 24/7.'

The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund has sent a formal letter to the South Carolina office, claiming that Chase's freedom to express gender was 'restricted'.

Lifestyle choice: Chase was hurt by the DMV's actions and believes the office banned make up because the teenager didn't meet their expectations of what a boy should look like

The letter also requests that Chase be allowed to have a new photo taken, 11 Alive reported.

Mrs Culpepper said the DMV policy had ruined what should have been an exciting day for the teenager.

'Instead, he was singled out and discriminated against because he did not meet the DMV’s expectations of how a boy should look,' she told Pink News.

'I want my son to be able to be himself without discrimination or harassment. I love him that way and the government should not be telling him that he’s not OK the way he is.'

Beth Parks, of the DMV, said that staff at the office had been following state policy, which had been updated in 2009 to say: 'At no time will an applicant be photographed when it appears that he or she is purposely altering his or her appearance so that the photo would misrepresent his or her identity.'
