The singer's altercation came after she had performed her latest gig on her Loud world tour at the city's Pavilhão Atlântico.

She wrote: 'I just met the most racist c**t EVER!!! This man said the craziest s**t about black women - called us dogs, sl**s, we don't look like s**t, we don't belong in the same hotels.

'Needless to say, the #N**** in me came out! Bajan accent and all! Lol! Turns out the hotel manager's black.

Angry: Rihanna took to her Twitter page after the altercation

'Oh and he had the NERVE to diss black people in his tighty whitey's!!!! SMH (shake my head)...and tbh (to be honest) a lil' black wouldn't hurt him.'

Rihanna's hotel clash came after she ended up running off stage after feeling sick on stage.

The Barbadian star dashed off to throw up, but soon returned and carried on singing like nothing had happened.

Her illness has prompted speculation she may be working too hard with his gruelling tour schedule, which has been going on since June.

She explained on Twitter: 'Portugal tonight was legendary!!! I ran 
off stage to throw up, halfway thru What's My Name... made it back 
juuuust (sic) in time for Rude Boy.'
