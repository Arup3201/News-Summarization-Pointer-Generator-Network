The plot of the new film 'Argo', in which a CIA operative poses as a Hollywood bigwig scouting locations in Tehran during political upheaval and secretly rescues six hostages, is almost as unbelievable as the true story behind the silver screen adaptation.

But CIA master of disguise Antonio Mendez is real, as are the six Americans saved in the daring rescue mission in 1979 during the Iran hostage crisis.

For almost three months, the group hid 
out in Iran, sheltered by the Canadian government until Mr Mendez flew in with fake business cards and a ridiculous cover story - and the Iranian revolutionaries believed every word.Â 

'This movie..if it weren't true, it would be terrible,' director Ben Affleck said. 'It would just seem absurd... the CIA is trying to get these people out of Iran and they turned to Hollywood for help?'

Iranian militants stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979, taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.

But a small group of six diplomats miraculously made it outside of the embassy and into the residence of the Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor, where they stayed for 79 days until their rescue.

Robert Anders, Henry Schatz, Mark and Cora Lijek and Joseph and Kathleen Stafford effectively didn't exist - the militants didn't know they were missing hostages and the Americans couldn't give away their position.

'It was like robbing banks, except in our case, we had to make it look like the money was still there,' Mr Mendez said to CBS.

As cover, Mr Mendez concocted an elaborate back story involving a Hollywood film called 'Argo'.

'When you're doing an ex-filtration of a group of people you need a cover story... a lie,' he said.

'Maybe it's not credible but it's so strange that it couldn't be false - it had to be true.'

Mr Mendez developed a plan to disguise the Americans as a Hollywood group scouting locations for the fake film. He said the team chose the name 'Argo' based on an obscene knock, knock joke.

He said the joke goes as follows: 'Knock, knock', 'Who's there?', 'Argo', 'Argo who?', 'Arr...go...f*** yourself.'

'"Argo" was kind of a battle cry we used when things were going a little dicey,' Mr Mendez said.

Taken Captive: 52 Americans were held captive in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, but six managed to escape to the Canadian ambassador's home, where they awaited rescue

Danger: A mass of Iranian protestors is held back from the gates of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Nov. 5, 1979. Iranian students stormed the embassy the day before, taking scores of American and other nationals as hostages

Crisis: Two lines of troops loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini stand in front of the U.S. Embassy during shooting in the compound, Feb. 15, 1979 in Tehran

As part of the plot, he obtained a 
script, advertised the film, printed business cards, and rented and 
staffed a Hollywood office in case anyone in Iran checked up on the 
story.

'We decided to call it "Studio Six" productions because there was six of these guys and gals,' he remembered.

Then, posing as the film's producer, 
he slipped into Tehran and began prepping the hostages for their big roles. As time went on, the situation became more and more dangerous, he said.

'The Canadian ambassador was getting anonymous phone calls with people asking for them by name,' Mr Mendez said.

'My chore was to get in and get everyone to believe in the first meeting that we were going to be able to do this.'

With a back story for each and every hostage, Mr Mendez helped transform the embassy workers into 
Hollywood types and handed them fake Canadian passports and whisked them to the airport.

Mr Schatz remembers how terrified he was when they got to the heavily guarded airport.

'Our hats were Canadian, our shirts were Canadian, all of the paraphernalia that comes along with life had that Canadian mark if someone decided to pull us aside and go through luggage,' he said to CBS. 'I ended up going through clearance first and was questioned.'

He said they first asked him if he was the person in his photograph, to which he responded 'yes.'

Then, he said, the guard left him and his compatriots in line and went into a side room. A few minutes later he returned - with a cup of tea.

Safely through the security check, the group waited patiently for their flight, which was delayed, before they successfully escaped on January 27, 1980. The Canadian embassy was closed on the same day and all of the people who aided the Americans were flown safely out of the country.

The other 52 hostages were released on January 20, 1981, after several attempt to negotiatetheir release and a failed rescue mission, with the signing of the Algiers Accords in Algeria on January 19, 1981 minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.

Once home, Mr Schatz gave Studio Six a ring.

'I called the phone number on my business card. I asked to speak to myself. They said "He's traveling in the Mid East,' Mr Schatz said. 'And I said, "No", I said "He's home"'

For years, Canada was credited as the organizers of the ingenious plot, the CIA getting no credit for the operation. It was even known as the 'Canadian Caper.'

That changed in 1997, the 50th anniversary of the CIA. Mr Mendez was honored by the agency that year, and the story behind Argo was declassified.

WIRED magazine covered the story in 2007 and in an ironic twist, director Ben Affleck optioned it for a real movie.

'The fact that it's based on true events means that you have to sort of take it seriously,' he said to CBS. He stars in it as Mr Mendez and Bryan Cranston, Alan Arkin and John Goodman star alongside him.
