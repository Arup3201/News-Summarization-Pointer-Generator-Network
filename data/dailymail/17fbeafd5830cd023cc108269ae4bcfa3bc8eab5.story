Mario Balotelli had a quiet transfer deadline day – so he took advantage by going for dinner with his ex-girlfriend Raffaella Fico and their daughter Pia.

Balotelli has struggled since his return to England with Liverpool. The Italian has two goals, one each in the Champions League and Capital One Cup, but is yet to find the net in the Premier League.

Earlier in the transfer window Balotelli had been linked with a return to Italy – but that never materialised and the striker spent the final hours of the transfer window in San Carlo restaurant in Manchester.

In December, Balotelli’s former manager at Manchester City Roberto Mancini said he was keen to take the striker to Inter Milan – but it never happened.

Last week, Balotelli’s agent Mino Raiola said the striker was ‘very disappointed' with his time at Liverpool but has no immediate plans to leave the club. 

'The plan is to continue at Anfield,' Raiola told Gazzetta dello Sport. 'I saw him Monday and told him: "You have a four-year contract and I won't bring you away. Or you leave Liverpool at 60-70 million, and I won my bet, or you'll die there."

Balotelli dated briefly a few years ago and had a daughter Pia together 

'It's the first time I've made a speech like that to a player. I've seen him quiet, changed, different than at Milan.

'He's very disappointed with himself, too. He's going through a bad time like he never had. In Liverpool he hasn't his spaces: if you don't make things as they want, you stay out. Then he was broken for eight weeks, he lost the rhythm.'

Balotelli and Raffaella enjoyed an evening together on Monday night 

Singer Raffaella and Balotelli dated briefly at the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012 and she gave birth to Pia in the summer of 2012.

Raffaella celebrated her 27th birthday last week and released her debut album Rush in October last year.
