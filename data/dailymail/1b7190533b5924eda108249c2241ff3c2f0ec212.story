Revenge came for the Tigers yesterday and sent out an ominous warning to the rest of the Aviva Premiership — the big cats from the east Midlands are in the title hunt again.

Bath had braced themselves for a ‘backlash’ after inflicting a record 45-0 humiliation on Leicester in September, but being prepared didn’t save them.

At a full and freezing Welford Road, this was a hot and spicy encounter, with countless off-the-ball scuffles as the fired-up home side pounded their way to the result they craved.

Bath — who had England hopeful Sam Burgess playing at centre for a full 80 minutes — made a sustained response in the final quarter and should have secured at least a losing bonus point, but they were repelled by the Tigers’ defence. 

A last-minute try by Ross Batty gave England fly-half George Ford a conversion which would have sent the visitors home with some consolation for their efforts, but he dragged his shot wide.

Soon after being annihilated at The Rec four months ago, Leicester slumped to ninth place in the table, amid a forensic inquest into the cause of the injury epidemic which was undermining their season.

But gradually the cavalry have been returning and Richard Cockerill, the Tigers’ director of rugby, declared this result will serve as a statement to the rest of the league.

‘It sends a bullet across the bows of everybody that we’re still in the mix and we still have the appetite to compete,’ he said.

‘It proves that we can beat the sides who have been on really good form, as clearly Bath have been. It puts us right back in the mix.

‘If we can win that game, with the quality that we’ve still got to come back into the side, it bodes well. In isolation it is a massive win for us. It’s only round 12 so there’s a long way to go but it’s certainly a building block for us. I’m relieved because we’ve put ourselves into a position to compete for the title.’

Cockerill attempted to play down the vengeance theme, adding: ‘We didn’t talk about that (45-0 defeat in the reverse fixture). We didn’t really want to re-visit it too much because every time we watched it, they looked so good!

‘I think it was in the back of the players’ minds but we focused on ourselves and on what we can do well. We wanted it more than they did. We defended exceptionally well and didn’t allow their back-line to create the opportunities they usually get.

‘Bath are a very physical team. The only way to meet physicality is with physicality. We felt we didn’t do that at The Rec and I think we put that right today. 

'We’ve seen how good Bath are when they’re on the front foot and playing well, but it’s also about how you deal with having an off-day and coming to a side who are very motivated.’ In many ways, this was a throw-back contest; awash with mud and bad-tempered needle as two pedigree packs jostled for supremacy.

Having been taken apart in the previous clash between the sides, the Tigers forwards channelled their angst to deliver a performance full of driving power.

They won a series of scrum penalties, although their line-out was hit and miss throughout. Ford and Owen Williams had landed a penalty apiece when Leicester claimed their solitary try in the 17th minute. It came in fitting fashion, from a close-range rolling maul in the Bath 22 which backs Miles Benjamin and Vereniki Goneva joined to help force Tom Youngs over the line.

Fast-forward to the 80th minute and Batty’s try came in the same place, by the same method. Aside from those scores, both defences held firm and the Tigers relied on three more penalties by Williams. Bath had several chances to hit back in the last 20 minutes but it was a day when the bounce of the ball and the interpretation of the officials didn’t fall in their favour.

They were forced to cope without Kyle Eastmond for the majority of the game as their England centre went off after suffering a bang to the calf. 

Burgess featured in the visitors’ midfield and thought he had claimed his maiden first-team try in union in the 31st minute, but it was ruled out as the pass he received from Ollie Devoto was deemed to have gone forward.

It was one of several close calls which went against Bath and their head coach, Mike Ford, said: ‘We were on the wrong side of the referee and we couldn’t adapt.

‘Is it because we’ve come to Leicester and the crowd are baying for our blood?

‘I’m not sure but I’m disappointed. I’m proud of the way we kept going and a bonus point was the least we deserved today. We expected the backlash and we got it, but to finish one try all at Leicester is no disgrace.’

When the dust had settled, Bath remained second in the table, with the Tigers fifth. Both clubs will be in the title shake-up at the end of the season.
