Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer both safely progressed to the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris.

Taking to the court last on Thursday, reigning champion and top seed Djokovic was made to work hard before ending the hopes of Paris-born Gael Monfils 6-3 7-6 (7/2) to claim his 11th win in 11 meetings with the Frenchman.

Djokovic’s victory came after Federer had kept up the heat on the Serbian in the fight to end the year as the world No 1 with a 6-4 6-4 success over 20-year-old qualifier Lucas Pouille.

Federer has now claimed 14 successive victories and is looking for a third consecutive title following his triumphs in Shanghai and Basle. 

If the 33-year-old second seed wins in Paris and Djokovic fails to reach the final, then the Swiss will replace his rival at the top of the world rankings.

Federer, the 2011 champion in Paris, next faces seventh seed Milos Raonic, who beat 11th-seeded Spaniard Roberto Bautista-Agut 7-5 7-6 (9/7) and has a chance of qualifying for next month’s World Tour Finals in London.
