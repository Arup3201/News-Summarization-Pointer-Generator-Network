A man convicted of hacking to death a woman he claimed was a witch has been sentenced to jail for 30 years in Papua New Guinea.

The 21-year-old man from the central highlands, where other so-called witches have received severe punishment, began his sentence as the country reels from the shock of the gang rape of a U.S. academic.

The rape of the unidentified 32-year-old American last Friday has resulted in scores of police searching the island where the incident occurred in the hope of finding the offenders in the untamed jungles.

Over the years there have been numerous accounts of 'witch killings', with the victims in many cases being attacked with bush knives and their bodies burned in Papua New Guinea

Her ordeal was yet another example of the violence women experience in the country lying to the north of Australia - particularly any suspected of practising sorcery to bring about the death of someone.

Many perpetrators who wreak vengeance on suspected witches escape justice - but this time villager Saku Aiya has been brought before a national court where he heard a judge tell him that his killing of a suspected witch was 'senseless, barbaric and brutal'.

Judge Mekeo Gauli said that for too long women groups had been asking for tough sentences to be imposed on those who murdered women they claimed were using sorcery against others.

The court was told that Aiya and two others blamed the death of their brother on witchcraft - and accused their uncle's wife, Penny Toyo.

In the early hours of June 26, 2010, Aiya and the two who are still at large went to Miss Toyo's home and held the family hostage with home-made guns.

Then they set about attacking Miss Toyo with machetes and an axe, striking her on an arm, neck and head.

Miss Toyo's family told the court how they watched helplessly as the ferocious attack took place.

They could only watch, they said, as 'her blood splattered across the floor before she collapsed and died'.

A senior police officer admitted that this was the first sorcery-related killing to reach the national court, although many other similar crimes occurred.

'So many such cases are reported but rarely go through to the high court as relatives accept their own customary ways of settlement in the village courts,' said Senior Sergeant Simon Mek, acting commander of the Porgera police station, in whose district the crime occurred.

A spokeswoman for women's groups, Miss Pinema Vakai, told the paper that the court decision to send Aiya to jail for 30 years was 'good and encouraged women to stop accepting compensation and should instead take these matters to court.'

Referring to the kinds of payments that were made to compensate for murders, Miss Vakai said: 'We don't want compensation payments for our sister's death - we have pigs, we have money.

'No compensation can bring our sister back to life.'

The judge said that in his view some people were using sorcery as an excuse to terminate someone's life though the suspect may not be a sorcerer.

But he said accusations of sorcery were becoming prevalent, yet only a handful were reported in the local media.

Earlier this year a young woman accused of sorcery was dragged from her home in the central highlands and burned to death on a rubbish dump.

In regional Bougainville a woman accused of being a witch was beheaded in front of a large crowd.

Over the years there have been numerous accounts of 'witch killing', with the victims in many cases being attacked with bush knives and their bodies burned.

An academic from the U.S. has spoken out about being gang raped in Papua New Guinea to highlight the violence suffered by women throughout the country

Meanwhile as the hunt continues for the nine armed men who attacked the US academic, police said they knew that one of the perpetrators was an escaped prisoner.

The 32-year-old woman, who was conducting research into exotic birds in a remote forest on Karkar Island, was walking along a bush track with her husband and a guide on Friday when they were set upon by the gang armed with knives and rifles.

Her husband and the guide were stripped and bound by the men, who then used a bush knife to hack off the woman's hair before raping her in a terrifying ordeal lasting 20 minutes.

The woman chose to speak out about the horrific attack - condemned by the country's prime minister Peter O'Neil as 'the cowardly act of animals' - to highlight the violence that women in Papua New Guinea experience.

The U.S. woman, who posed for a photograph but did not want to reveal her identity, spoke to media in Port Moresby as she and her husband waited for a flight to leave the country.

Relaying an ordeal that has sent shock waves throughout the country, the woman said the men first ordered her husband and the guide to strip naked before they were tried to trees.

Then they turned to the woman.

Her clothes were torn off, her hands were bound and her blonde hair was chopped off with bush knives. She was then raped one by one by the gang for a terrifying 20 minutes.

Her ordeal ended only when something in the forest startled the gang and they ran away.

The U.S. couple's guide managed to break free and released them, before they all ran naked along jungle tracks for several hours, determined to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the scene of the attack in case the gang came back.

Eventually they reached a remote village where they were given some clothing and from where they were able to raise the alarm.
