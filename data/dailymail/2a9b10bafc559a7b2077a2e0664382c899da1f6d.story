Marseille have made a fresh approach for Newcastle United defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa. 

The French side want the centre-back on a season loan with view to a permanent deal.

Meanwhile, Newcastle are interested in Rayo Vallecano's Guinea international right winger Lass Bangoura, 22.

On the move? Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa (centre) is a target for French club Marseille 

Elsewhere, Hatem Ben Arfa looks ready to dig in his heels and reject any move away from Newcastle in the current transfer window.

the France playmaker, forced to train with Newcastle's reserves by manager Alan Pardew, is determined to fight for his St James' Park future.

Newcastle bosses claimed Ben Arfa returned for the start of pre-season overweight, but the French midfielder looked sharp as he scored in a 5-2 reserve-team victory over Reading on Monday.

Ben Arfa's contract expires next summer and Newcastle are keen to offload the 27-year-old, with Pardew deeming him surplus to requirements.
