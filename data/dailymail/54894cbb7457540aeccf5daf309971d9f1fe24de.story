Enlarged heart: Medical examiners said Tuesday that American Idol season 7 contestant Michael Johns who was mysteriously found dead on a friend's couch in August died of a severely enlarged heart.

in laymen's terms, he had an enlarged heart that could no longer effectively pump blood through his body.

The condition, more common in men than in women, can be caused by a number of things, including infections and thyroid disease, but also severe alcohol abuse.

The Daily News reports that Johns also had a fatty liver and traces of a cold medicine in his system when he died.

The singer died at a friend's home in Orange County. Johns had sprained his ankle that had swelled to his knee and had sought medical attention the day before he died..

A tragic 911 call made by the friend who found Michael Johns' cold, motionless body was  released following his death.

TMZ obtained the recording in which the pal says he fears Michael is dead because he is cold to the touch and rigor mortis seems to have set in, suggesting he in fact passed more than an hour earlier.

Idol fan favorite: In laymen's terms, he had an enlarged heart that could no longer effectively pump blood through his body.

He also can be heard desperately giving the star CPR. He tells the dispatcher that he had seen Johns two hours prior and he seemed OK but when he returned his friend wasn't breathing.

The dramatic call  came after it was reported that Johns had been drinking heavily at some point before he died.

Johns was reportedly in full cardiac arrest when paramedics arrived on the scene and could not be revived. 

Johns, who was born Michael John Lee, was very close with his mother Janet and stepfather John, who was the father figure in Mr Johns' life.

Janet and John Burke both still live in Perth but visited their son frequently, including a surprise trip to Michael's home last year.

At the time, Michael expressed his delight that his mother and stepfather had 'turned up unannounced on his doorstep'. 

In a 2008 interview Johns spoke affectionately about his musical upbringing in Australia with his mother, stepfather and siblings, Cindy and Stephen.

'Everyone in my family is musical. My mum has a very pretty Doris Day-type voice,' he said.

'My brother and sister both play piano and sing. My stepfather is a great singer too. I was always around music growing up.'

Johns attended co-ed college Newman College in Churchlands, Perth.

Whilst in Perth, he sang in bands and was active in the musical theatre community, performing in performances including Pinocchio and Anything Goes at Perth's Regal Theatre and His Majesty's Theatre.

Mr Johns left Australia at the age of 18 to pursue music at the advice of his idol, You Am I frontman, Tim Rogers.

In a 2004 interview, Mr Johns thanked an encounter with the singer at the Australian music festival Big Day Out for inspiring his move to the United States.

'I snuck backstage and approached You Am I lead singer, Tim Rogers for advice. He told me if I wanted to make something happen, I had to go to the States.'

Michael left behind his Texan wife, Stacy Vuduris, whom he met in 2003 and married in 2007.

The singer competed in the seventh season of American Idol in 2008. During the show his supporters called themselves 'The Aussie Posse'.
