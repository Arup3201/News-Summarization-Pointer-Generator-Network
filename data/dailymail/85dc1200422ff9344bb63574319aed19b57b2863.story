Thousands of people lined the streets of York to welcome troops home from Afghanistan in a 'humbling' display, days after soldier Lee Rigby was murdered in the street in Woolwich.

The death of Drummer Rigby, 25, who was hacked to death by alleged Islamist extremists on Wednesday, left the nation appalled, and the community in York appeared determined to show its support for the armed forces as 2 Signal Regiment marched through the city yesterday.

The regiment's commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Colin Vaudin said the massive turnout at the parade was 'testament to the character of the British people'.

Defiant display: Hundreds of soldiers from 2 Signal Regiment marched through the city of York in a 'show of solidarity and strength against abhorrent acts'

'Humbled': The regiment's commanding officer said the huge turn-out in York was 'testament to the character of the British people'

Support: Thousands of people - including many dressed in Help for Heroes clothing - cheered on the soldiers as they paraded through the city streets, two days after Drummer Lee Rigby was murdered in the street in Woolwich

Drummer Rigby, from Halifax in Yorkshire, was walking to his London barracks wearing a Help for Heroes top when he was set upon and butchered by extremists wielding cleavers and knives.

Many members of the crowd were wearing tops and hats emblazoned with the name of the military charity, which has seen donations rocket in the days after the 25-year-old soldier's shocking death.

An order banning military personnel from wearing their uniforms in public was issued in the wake of the attack, but was quickly scrapped by Prime Minister David Cameron, who told Defence Secretary Philip Hammond he was 'seriously dismayed' by the official guidance.

The order had prompted defiant soldiers to post pictures of themselves in full military dress on line, and Mr Cameron insisted 'brave' service personnel must 'go about their lives as normal'.

The fury sparked by the short-lived ban made the sight of more than 300 uniformed soldiers marching in unison through York yesterday especially resonant.

Warm reception: The show of support for the military in York came two days after 25-year-old Drummer Lee Rigby was killed in the street in Woolwich

Lt Col Vaudin said the cheers from the crowd yesterday were evidence of the huge support for the armed forces among the public.

'I think the crowd have been superb,' he said yesterday.

'They've been very,
 very large, very supportive and hearing their claps and shouts of 
support means so much to myself and the soldiers of my regiment.

'Clearly the shocking attack on Drummer Rigby has affected us all and 
our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.

'The public support that was on display in the city of York is 
testament to the character of the British People and the warmth and 
respect they have for the armed forces.

'Throughout my service the people of the UK - the vast majority - are 
hugely supportive of the armed forces and everything we do, and I think 
that's what we've seen.'

Respect: The soldiers said the support from the crowd yesterday was evidence of the public's 'warmth and respect' for the armed forces

'Great job': More than 300 soldiers in full uniform marched through the city, left, while well-wishers including a young boy, right, cheered and waved Union flags

His wife, Jenny Vaudin, was one of the many who lined the route to 
welcome family and friends home from the six-month tour, which the 
regiment returned from last week.

'We came out to see the guys home, because they've done a great job and we're really proud of them,' she said.

Mrs Vaudin said the Woolwich attack had strengthened public support for troops.

'It's really hard to put into words that it's happening here,' she said.

'The good part of it is people are joining together in a show of 
solidarity and strength against acts like this, which are absolutely 
abhorrent.'

Solidarity: Troops are seen standing to attention in front of York Minster yesterday, as the regiment's return from Afghanistan was celebrated with a welcome parade

Parade: Soldiers from the regiment have spent months working in Helmand Province and Kabul, providing force protection as well as IT and telecommunications services

More than 300 soldiers took part in the parade from York Minster, accompanied by the Royal Corps of Signals Band.

The Lord Mayor of York, Councillor Julie Gunnell and Brigadier Greville 
Bibby CBE, Commander of 15 North East, Brigade saluted lines of troops 
as they marched past Mansion House.

Prayers: The murder of Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, on Wednesday left the nation stunned

The soldiers have been working at several locations within Helmand 
Province and Kabul providing force protection as well as 
telecommunications and IT services.

Watching the parade was Steven Beckett, a mechanic who turned out to show his gratitude.

'With the events of recent days, we need to show that as a nation we 
support our troops and stand by them when something so tragic happens,' 
he said.

Marie Hunt, a nurse who waved a Union flag as soldiers paraded past, 
said: 'This is an important day for the lads and lasses who've been in 
Afghanistan.

'To come home to news of the attack on the soldier must be absolutely horrible.'

North Yorkshire Police said no extra officers were deployed for the event but officers had been told to 'remain vigilant' as the parade took place.

Elsewhere yesterday the town of Poulton-le-Fylde in Lancashire was brought to a standstill as hundreds lined the streets as a mark of respect for a young soldier killed in Afghanistan.

Shops closed their doors as the hearse carrying Fusilier Samuel Flint's coffin approached St Chad's Church in the town centre, with many onlookers stepping forward to throw flowers onto the vehicle.

By the time the cortege reached the gates of the church it was covered in blooms.

The 21-year-old soldier died when the
 Mastiff armoured vehicle he was travelling in hit an IED while on 
patrol in Helmand province on April 30.

He was killed along with Corporal 
William Savage, 30, who served with him in the 2nd Battalion The Royal 
Regiment of Scotland, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, who served 
with the 7th Battalion of the Regiment.

The
 hundreds who had gathered in the square outside the church stood in 
silence as the pallbearers made their way through the graveyard to the 
sound of a lone piper.

Fusilier Flint's coffin was carried into the service with full military honours yesterday, as his family walked behind.

The Ministry of Defence said all 
three men were part of a patrol travelling along Route 611 between 
Forward Operating Base Ouellette and Patrol Base Lashkar Gah Durai in 
Nahr-e-Saraj when their vehicle was hit by the IED blast.

Avid Manchester City fan Fusilier Flint joined the Army in November 2011 and was deployed to Afghanistan in March.

The
 crowd broke into spontaneous applause when Fusilier Flint's coffin was 
carried out of the church following the hour-long service.

Mark of respect: Hundreds of people lined the streets of Poulten-Le-Fylde to mark the funeral of Fusilier Samuel Flint, 21, yesterday, with many throwing flowers onto the hearse as it passed en route to St Chad's Church

Grief: Relatives and friends of the young soldier, who was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan on April 30, walked behind the hearse before his coffin was carried into the church with full military honours

Heartbreak: Fusilier Samuel Flint was killed along with Corporal William Savage, 30, and Private Robert Hetherington, 25, when the armoured vehicle they were travelling in drove over an IED

Many of those packed outside were in tears as the congregation left to Swedish House Mafia's Don't You Worry Child.

Earlier,
 the crowd listened in silence to the service, which included eulogies 
from Fusilier Flint's friend Fusilier Jeffrey Batista and some of his 
six brothers and sisters.

Emotion: A soldier looks on as the hearse carrying the coffin of Fusilier Samuel Flint made its way through Poulton-Le-Fylde in Lancashire yesterday

Service: Apparently overcome, the soldier was comforted by a colleague outside the service in St Chad's Church in Fusilier Flint's home town
