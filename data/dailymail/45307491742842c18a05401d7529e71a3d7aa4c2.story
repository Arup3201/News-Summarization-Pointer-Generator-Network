There was nothing immaculate about a Catholic school teacher’s conception.

Christa Dias, a former teacher at Holy Family and St. Lawrence Catholic schools in Cincinnati, Ohio, claims she was fired for becoming pregnant using artificial insemination.

Ms Dias was fired in October 2010 when, at five and a half months pregnant, she approached her employer about maternity leave options.

The schools initially fired Ms Dias, 32, for being single and pregnant, Cincinnati.com reports. 

When the schools discovered that violated several federal and state anti-discrimination laws, they said she was fired because she became pregnant using artificial insemination.

That, the school said, was in direct violation of her contract.

‘She has a right to her opinion, but she doesn’t have a right to violate her (employment) contract,’ Archdiocese of Cincinnati spokesman Dan Andriacco told the website.

The contract Ms Dias signed called for employees to adhere to Catholic social teachings, including the avowal that having a child without a husband and out of wedlock is a ‘grave immoral’ act.

Ms Dias is still unemployed and now has a ten-month-old daughter for which to care.

Her case against the schools is on hold in the U.S. District Course in Cincinnati as the Supreme Court rules on a similar case.

'I'm disappointed more than anything that I couldn't continue my career because I wanted a child.'

Ms Dias, formerly of Michigan, began teaching in the Cincinnati schools in 2007 after graduating from Notre Dame College in South Euclid, Ohio, on a volleyball scholarship.

She began teaching at Holy Family in 2008 and at St Lawrence a year later. She served as the technology coordinator at each school and earned a collective salary of around $36,000.

The Enquirer says that while she is not Catholic, she is a practising Christian.

‘I’m disappointed more than anything that I couldn’t continue my career because I wanted a child,’ the former teacher told Cincinnati.com. 

According to her attorney, both schools have admitted ‘they had no other reason to terminate Ms Dias’ employment’ aside from her controversial pregnancy.

Ms Dias said she is suing because, according to her, the school holds a double-standard.

Men who participate in artificial insemination don’t have the tell-tale signs of pregnancy, she said, but the fact that it isn’t enforced is much of the problem.

The schools attorneys said the case is all about Ms Dias violating her contract. They said any argument besides that would ‘unavoidably put (Catholic) doctrine itself on trial.’

'(My daughter is) an amazing gift from God. She's amazing and wonderful. I would do it all over again for her.'

However, per the U.S. Constitution, Americans have the right to practise their religion of choice.

Reverend James Kiffermeyer, who was himself suspended in 2002 after being accused of sexual misconduct, fired Ms Dias.

The Archdiocese made a financial settlement with one accuser, while the Vatican reviewed the cases and didn’t discipline Mr Kiffermeyer.

Both men were over 18 at the time.

He was reinstated in 2006 and became pastor at Holy Family church.

Legal dealings aside, Ms Dias said she is happy to have a young life to care for and still believes she made the right decision. ‘She’s an amazing gift from God,’ she said of her daughter.

‘She’s amazing and wonderful. I would do it all over again for her.’
