I keep hearing about the win-win relationship between England and the Premiership clubs but, exactly a year out from the World Cup, I am seriously questioning the effectiveness of this partnership from the national team’s perspective.

Top-level sport is an unforgiving arena; you normally get just one chance, and there can be no room for compromise. Yet England and the RFU are allowing things to happen that are already damaging our World Cup chances. The clubs, in contrast, fight their fights with an uncompromising resolve and conviction.

Firstly, how on earth can England allow Steffon Armitage’s name to appear in Philippe Saint-Andre’s 74-man preliminary World Cup squad, subject to him receiving a French passport? The player named the best in Europe last season is English, has played for England and wants to play for England again. Yet his name is on a French team sheet. It’s baffling.

Toulon's Steffon Armitage is English and wants to play for England, but is in a preliminary squad for France

Armitage isn't picked for England due to his playing in France, but new salary cap rules make it illogical that he remain an exile from Stuart Lancaster's team

The World Cup draw dictates there is a decent chance England could meet the French in the semi-finals next year — we’ve played each other in the last three World Cups — and how are we going to feel if Armitage reels off a match-winning performance at Twickenham against us?

The Armitage situation is wrong on so many levels. The man in the England No 7 shirt needs to know he is the best and just as importantly his team-mates must be in no doubt. Stuart Lancaster should not tolerate a situation in which, potentially, there is somebody else he could have picked if ‘made available’. And what about the fans shelling out big money? They also have a right to know that England are leaving no stone unturned to select the best squad and then the strongest team.

We have a talented pack including outstanding back-rowers, but would we be better for having Armitage available? Certainly. Are we worse off with Armitage playing against us? Emphatically so. So why is this happening?

England’s decision not to pick Armitage — or any other player playing outside England — is justified as a way of protecting the club game from an exodus of stars. However, winning a home World Cup would result in the biggest boost imaginable to English rugby, and to have a chance of delivering this we must pick the best players.

Compounding all this comes the breaking news that from next season Premiership clubs will be allowed to sign two marquee players who will not be considered part of the £5million salary cap. These players will almost certainly be overseas stars off the back of the World Cup. They will be the best players money can buy.

Some would call that self-serving of the clubs but although there are downsides, I disagree. The clubs are simply asserting the initiative and the ‘no compromise’ mentality required and which is the essence of elite sport.

Armitage, the 2013-14 European player of the year, during his man of the match performance in the Heineken Cup final against Saracens - he could play against England at the World Cup after applying for a passport

What the announcement this week does is totally expose the RFU’s now untenable position of not picking England players abroad and leaves them wide open to criticism of double standards. 

There is no logic in England’s Premiership being encouraged and allowed by the RFU to sign these key overseas players — to recognise their value and status in the professional game — while the England management continue to treat English players overseas like outcasts and bans them from representing their country. 

There is hypocrisy everywhere. Armitage is and has always been fully available for England, he negotiated that with Toulon from the start. What is the moral difference between Steffon Armitage now and England players currently in the Premiership who will join French clubs after the World Cup?

Chris Robshaw not captaining Harlequins in a World Cup year is another example of the RFU falling short in this so-called win-win relationship with the clubs. Robshaw needs to be making big decisions and vital calls under pressure every week, he needs to be on top of his game and a big part of that game is the confidence and authority he carries as a captain.

Robshaw has combined being the Quins and England captain since 2011 and has done a fine job with both in challenging circumstances. It’s been the making of him as a player. Take one part of that equation away and you could end up with a lesser player as well as a diminished leader. Do that and his position will quickly come under threat because England do not lack for back-row options.

This is not the season for Robshaw to take a back seat. Can you imagine Martin Johnson or Lawrence Dallaglio allowing this situation to arise? It might suit Harlequins but it doesn’t suit England. Stuart Lancaster should be throwing tea cups around over this decision. He needs all his leaders to the fore this season, ideally ensuring at least six of his starting team are captaining their clubs week in, week out. In the 2003 World Cup we had 11 past, present and future England captains in the matchday squad for the final.

I applaud the clubs for their hard-line attitude and flexing their muscles to get what they want and need. Their priority is to win the Premiership and European Champions Cup, to put bums on seats, to make a profit, to grow professional rugby in this country. End of story.

The clubs will do what it takes, within the laws and regulations. It’s about time the RFU started showing real toughness and matched this attitude head-on. If it was their jobs on the line, these decisions would not be made, and that is why we are getting compromise.

The alarm bells started ringing earlier this year when the clubs got their way and wouldn’t rejig their Premiership schedule to allow England to field a first team in the opening Test against New Zealand in Auckland. Again I don’t blame the clubs, but I do blame the RFU for not fighting their corner much harder and this single decision derailed England. We will only know by how much at a later date.

The World Cup starts in 365 days and the gloves have to come off. We must get tougher off the field. In a World Cup year, it’s your prerogative; and when that World Cup is at home, it’s your right.

The RFU needs to get tougher with clubs a year out from the World Cup

@highlight

Steffon Armitage has been named in France's preliminary World Cup squad

@highlight

He could be available to Philippe Saint-Andre, subject to getting a passport 

@highlight

Europe's best player for Toulon is English and wants to play for England

@highlight

Yet he could conceivably play for France in England at the World Cup 

@highlight

With the new marquee player rules in the Premiership, it's hypocritical of the RFU to not pick Armitage because he took a big-money deal in France

@highlight

Chris Robshaw should captain Harlequins AND England

@highlight

Robshaw was stepped down from the Quins role for Joe Marler

England coach Stuart Lancaster should be throwing tea cups over the move - Robshaw needs to be making big calls under pressure every week
