Poundland is partnering on a new range of bakeware with celebrity baker, author and actress Jane Asher.

Launching in spring 2014, the exclusive collection of £1 items marks the first celebrity range for the discount retailer.  

Jane, 67, has helped design the range of bakeware for 
Europe's biggest single price discount retailer. The range will be sold across its 
490 shops in the UK and Ireland.

Pots, jugs and stands are all part of Jane Asher's collection of bakeware for Poundland - all £1 each

Full details of the collection will be revealed in February.

Jane has acted since childhood and is well-known for her many roles on stage and screen since making waves in Alfie opposite Michael Caine in 1966.

More recently she has been heavily involved in charitable work with the National Autistic Society and Autistica, raising funds for autism research.

A passionate baker with her own party cakes business and shop, she also has several books on baking to her name.

She said: 'I'm delighted to be working with Poundland on developing this fantastic new bakeware range and have designed, tested and worked with every single product.

'Home baking can give such enormous 
pleasure - both to those who bake and those who eat it! It is also an 
economical way of making great quality breads, cakes and pies but of 
course the cost of all the equipment can be an issue for some.

'In my new
Poundland range this will no longer be a problem as all the baking 
essentials are covered and offer amazing value for money.

'The range is very pretty, and comes in four pastel colours which can be mixed and matched. I've also included six quick, easy and delicious cake mixes.'

CEO of Poundland, Jim McCarthy, said: 'We're very proud that we're the first discount retailer to launch a celebrity range and very excited to be working with Jane Asher.

'We're extremely pleased to be offering our customers an affordable entry point into the hugely popular home baking trend.

'For well under £10 they will be ready to bake with Poundland - and we're confident that combining the excitement of a bargain with the enthusiasm of baking is going to be a recipe for success!'

Poundland's debut celebrity 
collaboration comes off the back of the rising popularity in baking in 
the UK, which now sees one in seven Britons baking more than twice a 
week.
