She the London-born beauty who’s wowed Hollywood and can call George Clooney and Jennifer Aniston close friends.

In fact, it was at George’s estate in Lake Como where she married actor John Krasinski.

But ever-modest Emily Blunt, 31, maintains that her life is just as chaotic and unglamorous as any other new mother's.

Back to business: Three months after giving birth Emily Blunt is on the promotion trail for her new action-film Edge of Tomorrow, with Tom Crusie

Praise indeed: Apparently Tom Cruise initiated a meeting with Emily Blunt after being impressed by her performance in another film

And, despite a recent holiday in Mexico with Jennifer Aniston and her fiancé Justin Theroux, Emily says her life is, actually, really quite normal.

In an interview with Helena de Bertodano for Stella magazine, the actress, who is currently promoting her new film Edge of Tomorrow with Tom Cruise, says: ‘I don’t feel I lead a glamorous life. Most of the people we’re friends with are people you can just hang out with.’

Emily, who gave birth to first daughter Hazel in February, also maintains that the glitzy Hollywood lifestyle is never going to go to her head.

‘Everybody was asking, “What’s your birth plan?”’ she says.

‘And I was like, “I don’t really have one, to be honest.” The nurses were like, “Thank God” - they’re used to women who come in and say, “I want this music playing when the baby comes out, I want this candle, these flowers…”’

Edge of 
Tomorrow is Emily’s first film since the birth of Hazel, and one which 
required a gruelling three-month training regime to get her into shape.

Fortunately, she says, all the filming was done before she became pregnant as she got injured and fell over so often.

Since
 Emily’s been back in the spotlight, and just three months after the 
birth of Hazel, she has noticeably whipped back into shape quickly,
 though has credited breast-feeding for her slim physique.

‘I found that because I managed to produce a lot of milk, I don't know why, it helped me lose the weight,’ she told Ellen DeGeneres recently.

‘My boobs thought I had 12 children!’

Prior to Edge of Tomorrow, Emily is most famous for playing the bitchy and ruthlessly-ambitious assistant in The Devil Wears Prada, and Queen Victoria in The Young Victoria, to name but a few staring roles.

Whether it’s action, comedy or drama, Emily’s career has gone from strength-to-strength, and it was apparently her performance in The Adjustment Bureau with Matt Damon in 2011 that made Tom Cruise sit up, take notice, and asked his team to arrange an interview.

Hard to believe, then, that Emily nearly changed her name when her career started.

She hated her surname: ‘Because we all know what it rhymes with. But my English agent at the time said, “Don’t, it’s so memorable.” Now, every male actor I work with ends up just calling me “Blunt.”’
