One plane was diverted and another delayed to avoid two Russian bombers that flew through Irish-controlled air space without warning in February, the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) said.

The disruption is believed to have occurred during the same February 18 incident in which British RAF Typhoon fighters were scrambled to escort two Russian bear bombers identified flying close to British airspace.

The move was seen as a show of strength by Russia amid tensions over the conflict in Ukraine, where Prime Minister David Cameron has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of challenging the territorial integrity of Kiev.

The Irish authority said the two Russian aircraft were flying with their transponders switched off - devices that help aircraft to be identified by air traffic control radars. 

The two Typhoons, armed with air-to-air missiles, were launched from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire after the Russian bombers were spotted at 6.30pm.

They were escorted as they flew south, then turned around and flew north past the Irish coast.

'One aircraft's departure from Dublin was delayed due to the activity of the Russian military aircraft in UK-controlled airspace,' the IAA said in a statement.

'The routing of one en route aircraft was changed to ensure that its track was sufficiently separated from the track of the two Russian military aircraft,' it added.

Since January last year, there have been at least 17 shows of military strength by Russia near the UK. The most serious included:

Feb 18: RAF jets scrambled after two Russian Bear bombers spotted off the coast of Cornwall, forcing a flight from Dublin to divert.

Feb 15: Russian warship intercepted by Royal Navy in the English Channel.

Jan 28: RAF fighters challenge two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear missiles south of Bournemouth.

Jan 8: Defence chiefs ask for US help to hunt a suspected Russian submarine lurking off the coast of Scotland.

Nov 2014: Russian flotilla on military exercise in the Channel escorted from UK waters by HMS Tyne.

Nov 2014: Nato aircraft called in to hunt suspected Russian submarine off the west coast of Scotland.

Oct 2014: RAF Typhoon warplanes shadow two Bears as they fly down the west coast of Britain.

The diverted and delayed planes were commercial jets 'carrying hundreds of people', the Irish Examiner newspaper reported. 

However, the IAA sad there had been 'no safety impact to civilian traffic in Irish controlled airspace'.

The aircraft did not enter Irish sovereign airspace, but flew in Irish controlled airspace within 25 nautical miles (46.3 km) of the Irish coast between 3pm GMT and 7pm GMT, according to the authority. 

That incident came after one of the huge Cold War-era Tu-95 planes was spotted in the skies off the coast of Bournemouth in January.

British Defence Minister Michael Fallon warned that NATO needs to be ready for 'any kind of aggression from Russia' following the incident, which came after London summoned the Russian ambassador over a similar episode in January.

On Tuesday, leaders of the United States, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and EU head Donald Tusk called for a 'strong reaction' from the international community to any major violation of a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine in a bid to increase pressure on Russia.

Both Kiev forces and pro-Russian rebels accuse the other of continuing to mount attacks in defiance of a deal forged in a bid to end 11 months of bloodshed that has killed over 6,000 people, according to the UN.

Nevertheless, violence has abated over the past week, increasing hopes the agreement could hold.

The move has been seen as a show of strength by Russia amid tensions over the conflict in Ukraine, where David Cameron has accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of challenging the territorial integrity of Kiev
