More issues in Ferguson: Former Ferguson, Missouri correctional officer Jaris Hayden is accused in a criminal suit of having sex with a pregnant inmate and then setting her free. In a separate civil suit, the inmate says she was raped by Hayden

A former Ferguson corrections officer faces felony charges and a lawsuit for allegedly having sex with a pregnant inmate and allowing her to escape, a case that comes as the St. Louis suburb's police force is already under scrutiny following the shooting death of Michael Brown.

Jaris Hayden, 29, will be arraigned December 3 on charges of acceding to corruption by a public servant, permitting escape and two counts of sexual contact with a prisoner. His attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said Hayden posted $10,000 bond and intends to plead not guilty.

The incident allegedly happened October 9, 2013. Hayden was indicted by a grand jury earlier this month, and the woman filed her lawsuit against Hayden on Friday in federal court.

In her suit, the woman identified as J.W. alleges the misconduct began as soon as she got to the jail, when she was booked by Hayden and he told her 'You smell good' and said 'this will teach you a lesson.'

According to the woman's lawsuit, she was taken to jail for driving with expired license plates and giving the officer a false name.

The suit said her boyfriend had already posted $200 bond when Hayden took her to a boiler room at the jail and forced her to have sex.

But while still in the cell, J.W. says she told Hayden she'd 'do anything to go home,' but that she did not mean sex notes Buzzfeed.

Nonetheless, J.W. says Hayden took her downstairs and told her to perform oral sex on him, which she did. 

The suit says they then had vaginal intercourse. Afterwards, Hayden allegedly set her free out a side door.

A pubic hair J.W. says she took from the scene has since tested positive as Hayden's. 

Ferguson City Attorney Stephanie Karr said in a statement that after the city learned of the complaint against Hayden, it began its own investigation that led to his firing on Nov. 19, 2013. He had worked for the city for 18 months. Karr said city officials and employees cooperated with federal authorities in the investigation. 

Shocking: The alleged incident occurred at the Ferguson City Jail, where a plaintiff named only as J.W. says she was raped in the boiler room before being let out a side door

The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault. The woman was only identified by her initials in the lawsuit.

Bevis Schock, the woman's attorney, said the case raises renewed concerns in Ferguson.

'The numerous acts of violence against the citizenry by law enforcement of the City of Ferguson constitute a pattern,' Schock said in the lawsuit.

The criminal case is different than the lawsuit in that it alleges that Hayden accepted the woman's offer to perform sex acts in exchange for allowing her to escape. Schock said the woman was raped and there was no such agreement.

The suit said the woman was several months pregnant.

Ferguson has been the site of protests since the 18-year-old Brown, who was unarmed, was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. A grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge Wilson. Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch, said the Wilson grand jury is not the same one that indicted Hayden.

A St. Louis County town that neighbors Ferguson, Missouri, is warning residents to prepare for potential unrest that may follow the grand jury announcement in the Michael Brown case.

Berkeley officials passed out flyers this week urging its 9,000 residents to be prepared just as they would in the event of a major storm, with plenty of food, water and medicine on hand in case they're unable to leave home for several days.

The flyer says Lambert Airport will be protected by the National Guard, but airport spokesman Jeff Lea says that's wrong. Lea says the airport will continue to be protected by its own security force.

Brown was killed Aug. 9 by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge Wilson.

A suburban St. Louis school district says schools will get early notice once the Ferguson grand jury reaches a decision.

A letter on the Hazelwood School District's site from Superintendent Grayling Tobias says the St. Louis County prosecutor's office will alert districts 24 hours before the media if the decision is on a weekend.

If it's a weekday, Tobias says districts will learn three hours before media, so students can be sent home before potential protests. District spokesman Jack Wang says districts won't be told what the decision is.
