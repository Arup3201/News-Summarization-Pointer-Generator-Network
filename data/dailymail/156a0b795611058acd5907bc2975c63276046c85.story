Mysterious bright lights in the sky have been baffling astronomers and amazing the public from coast to coast all weekend.

Reports of unusual red and blue lights streaking across the sky from San Francisco to Washington DC have been coming in since Friday, with seasoned sky watchers claiming that they are moving too slow to be meteors.

Some have speculated that they could be a secret missile test or space junk falling to earth, but as of Monday morning there was no word from NASA or the Defense Department to confirm either of these theories.

What is it? The light lit up the sky from the West Coast of the country to the East Coast over the weekend

Social media lit up on Saturday on the West Coast as more than 100 people from British Columbia to San Francisco saw a strange streak of light tear across the night sky.

'I am used to seeing planes early in the morning with lights, but this was different,”' said one bystander.

'This had something coming out of it, it wasn’t just the light. I could see it spraying something.'

On Sunday evening on the other side of the country, reports began coming in of a bright light in the sky witnessed from Pittsburgh to New York City.

Lighting up the sky: According to experts the trail behind the light appears to be vapour and is too long to be a genuine shooting star

Unusual: The lights appeared to witnesses from over the weekend - but the US Air Force have denied any missile tests took place

Described as a bright white or yellow flash, the American Meteor Society was inundated with eye witness accounts.

Despite there being two meteor showers taking place currently across the northern hemisphere, astronomers are unsure if the evidence points towards shooting stars.

The Southern Taurid meteor shower usually produces shooting stars and the less well known Piscids usally peak in later September and October.

Bing Quock of the Morrison Planetarium at the California Academy of Scienes said that he needs to see more evidence.

'Looking at the website of the American Meteor Society, it looks like there are several reports of a large bright object falling through the sky,' he said to CBS San Francisco.

'It’s rather unusual in that this one had a rather large tail following behind it.'

Geral McKeegan of the Chabot Space and Sciene Center in Oakland had interesting conclusions.

'We’re thinking maybe it was either a piece of space junk that has fallen out of orbit and into our atmosphere or it might have been some kind of a missile test launch,' said McKeegan.

However, the US Air Force Based at Vandenburg said no missile launches have taken place this weekend.
