The internet celebrity known as 'Kai, the hatchet-wielding hitchhiker' who faces murder charges for allegedly killing a lawyer has been rushed to hospital following an apparent suicide attempt.

Caleb 'Kai' McGillvary, 24, was taken from the Union County jail in Elizabeth, New Jersey to hospital on Wednesday with non life-threatening injuries and is expected to recover.

He was later transferred to another health facility, where he remains under guard, officials told The Star-Ledger of Newark. They declined to detail the injuries or how he was found.

Kai became an Internet celebrity after
he thwarted a deadly attack on a California woman with the help of his 
hatchet in February.

But despite appearances on Jimmy Kimmel and an immediate fan base, his hero status quickly disintegrated after he was accused of beating 73-year-old lawyer Joseph Galfy to death at his home after they met in Times Square.

Galfy's body was found two days later. Their earlier encounter was caught on surveillance video.

The victim was found severely beaten and wearing only his underwear and socks by police, who went to his home to check on his well-being.

Statements posted on McGillvary's Facebook page following the homicide indicated the encounter was sexual in nature.

On his Facebook page, McGillvary's last post before he was arrested said: 'What would you do? if you awoke in a stranger's house and found you'd been drugged and sexually assaulted.'

One friend who commented suggests 'hitting him with a hatchet' – and McGillvary's final comment on the post said: 'I like your idea.'

Photos and a YouTube video from early March show the 24-year-old vagrant getting an elaborate tattoo on his right cheek which helped police apprehend him after a Starbucks barrista recognized it and told police.

McGillivary was later booked into the Union county Jail on $3million bail.

McGillvary, better known on YouTube and Facebook as Kai
Lawrence, Caleb Kai Lawrence and Kai Nicodemus, became an instant Internet celebrity
in February when he was featured on a California news report for saving three people
from 54-year-old Jett Simmons McBride by hitting him on the head with a
hatchet.

The homeless hitchhiker, who describes himself as 'homefree,'
was riding in a passenger seat with McBride when he said the man started making
racist comments and calling himself Jesus Christ.

The incident culminated with the out-of-control driver slamming
into a black utility worker and pinning him against his truck.

He then
allegedly attacked two women who came to the aid of the victim, at which point
McGillvary jumped into action and hit the assailant over the head with a
hatchet he had on him. 

McGillvary, sporting long shaggy hair tied with a bandanna,
later described his heroics in a hilarious, profanity-laced stream-of-consciousness
interview that instantly went viral online.

Since the February incident, the 24-year-old self-described
surfer dude has been regularly writing about his adventures on the road on his
Facebook page under the user name 'Caleb Kai Lawrence Yodhehwawheh.

According to his Facebook page, Galfy was a founding partner
at the Rahway law firm Kochanski, Baron Galfy, P.C.    

Galfy's neighbors said the 73-year-old had been living alone
since his long-time partner died five years prior.

According to 
Galfy's obituary, he served in the Army from 1965 to 1970 as a major, 
and got his Juris Doctor degree from Seton Hall University.

Galfy served as the attorney for the Planning Board in Green Brook, and in his free time played in a wedding band for 25 years.
