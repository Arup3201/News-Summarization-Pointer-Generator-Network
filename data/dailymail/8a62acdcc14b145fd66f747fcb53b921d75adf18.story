Two hero bin men today told how they rescued a terrified woman and her dog from a sinking car - after she drove off a 20ft harbour wall and plunged into the sea.

Derek Main, 35, and Gary Roberts, 43, were eating their lunch at Burghead harbour in Moray when they heard a loud revving noise followed by a massive splash.

The duo fled to the water's edge to find the shocked woman and her dog trapped in a brand new Vauxhall Corsa.

Mystery: It is not yet clear what happened to lead to the red Vauxhall flying into the sea, but thankfully there were no injuries

While Derek ran for some ropes, Gary swam into the harbour with a mystery Irish cyclist who said he was a lifeguard and freed the panicking woman, thought to be in her 50s, from the stricken vehicle.

Derek, of Lossiemouth, recalled the bizarre incident which happened 12.20pm on Thursday afternoon.

He said: 'We were at the harbour having our lunch. We saw a person sitting in the car and we thought she was taking in the view, which is not unusual.

'But suddenly there was an almighty revving sound and the car shot into the water.'

Gary ran down the slipway and began swimming out to the car, while the Irish man, who would only give his name as Paddy, stripped off and dived 20ft off the pier into the water.

With the car being washed out to sea and already submerged in water as deep as 12ft, the men had to act quickly.

Gary, 43, of nearby Lhanbryde, said: 'Derek took his boots off, but I went straight in with all my gear on.

'I noticed there was a woman in the front seat holding a dog.

'I'd just reached the car when this Irish guy got the woman out of the driver's seat.

'As he was pulling her to safety he shouted out that there was still a dog in the back of the car.

'At this stage the car was sinking and I didn't think I'd be able to open the door because of the water pressure, but I just about managed it.

'A collie dog clambered out, but then it started swimming the wrong way out into the harbour.

'It was panicking and snarling at me, so after pushing it round the right way I decided to just let it make its own way back.'

Derek added: 'The woman was probably aged in her 50s.

'After she was brought out of the water, she started going on about how she had valuables in the car, so the Irish guy went back into the water.

'The car was completely submerged by then, but he dived down and managed to bring a couple of items back, including the dog's pillow.

'The woman was quite shaken and shivering. She seemed to be suffering from shock.

'The whole incident was a scary thing to be involved in.

'We didn't think about it at the time, but afterwards you realise just what a close thing it had been.'

Gary said: 'It was a close shave, if it hadn't been for that other guy jumping in and helping, who knows what would have happened?

'The lady was very lucky.'

Local resident Sarah Doonan said she thinks the woman accidentally drove off the edge of the pier.

She said: 'It's all a bit bizarre, but thankfully she's OK.

'She seems to have just been sitting there looking out to sea and then somehow managed to press the accelerator by mistake and drove into the sea.

'She definitely didn't mean to do it as she said she had a lot of valuables and money in the car.'

The woman was taken to Dy Gray's Hospital in Elgin for a check-up but is not thought to have suffered any serious injuries.

Police and an ambulance went to the scene, as did the village's coastguard, who winched the woman's Corsa - which became completely submerged at one point - up the slipway and out of the water.

It is thought that the woman's dog is recovering in a local boarding kennel.Â
