A miniature satellite carrying a smartphone has been launched into space.

The British-built Strand-1 spacecraft, developed by scientists in Surrey, was sent into orbit from Sriharikota in India.

Known as 'phonesat', the device is 
the first off-the-shelf smartphone to be sent out of the earth's 
atmosphere, where it will orbit the planet in synchronisation with the 
sun at 488 miles (785km).

You'd expect to see an Android in space... A UK team is set to launch the first satellite controlled by a smartphone. The STRaND-1 satellite will be controlled by a Google Nexus during part of its space mission

Scientists from the University of 
Surrey's Surrey Space Centre (SSC) and Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd 
(SSTL) are testing how gadgets that are available on the high street can
perform in space.

The Google Nexus One android 
smartphone has been loaded with special experimental apps and will act 
as the 'brain of the satellite'.

Professor Sir Martin Sweeting, SSC 
director and also executive chairman of SSTL, said: "This mission is a 
fantastic achievement and a great tribute to the hard work of the 
engineers involved.

'The UK's first nanosatellite Snap-1,
also built by SSC and SSTL and launched in 2000, was the world's most 
advanced nanosatellite at the time - Strand-1 continues that story with 
the latest technologies available to us in 2013.'

The smartphones that many people 
carry around in their pockets contain the highly advanced technologies 
that are integral to satellites - such as cameras, radio links, 
accelerometers and high performance computer processors.

Experts said they have almost everything needed to operate a satellite - except the solar panels and propulsion.

The Google Nexus One has been tested to work in a vacuum and at temperatures as low as minus 20C and as high as 50C.

Its apps were chosen from entries to a
Facebook competition, one of which tests whether a 'Scream in Space' 
can be heard through vibrations in the phone's microphone.

Developed by Cambridge University Space Flight, it makes use of several screams that were submitted by visitors to the project's website.

Alien, starring Sigourney Weaver, had the tagline: 'In space no-one can hear you scream'

At various points, the app will play videos of the screams and monitor if the phone's onboard speaker picks up the noise.

Also fitted on the 3.9in (10cm) x 11.8in (30cm) satellite - which weighs
9.5lbs (4.3kg) - is a new Linux-based high-speed processor, an orbit 
control system and two water-alcohol fuelled plasma thrusters.

The smartphone is pressed up against a side panel of the 30cm-long, 4.3kg cubesat, so that it's 5MP camera can look out and take pictures of the Earth and the Moon.

The STRaND-1 (which stands for Surrey Training Research and Nanosatellite Demonstration) is a joint project between Surrey Space Centre and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, a world leader in small commercial spacecraft.

Modern smartphones contain advanced technologies and incorporate several key features that are essential to satellites like cameras, radio links, accelerometers and high performance computer processors.

Add in solar panels and propulsion systems and that's almost everything a spacecraft needs to fly.

During the first phase of the mission, STRaND-1 will use a number of experimental 'Apps' to collect data whilst a new high-speed linux-based CubeSat computer developed by SSC takes care of the satellite.

In phase two, the STRaND-1 team plan to switch the satellite's in-orbit operations to the smartphone, thereby testing the capabilities of a number of standard smartphone components for a space environment.

During the summer of 2011, the STRaND team ran a Facebook competition to find apps to be loaded onto the satellite's Nexus One smartphone prior to its launch.

The winners are:

iTesa, which will record the magnitude of the magnetic field around the phone during orbit.  Used as a precursor to further scientific studies, such as detecting Alfven waves (magnetic oscillations in our upper atmosphere), the iTEsa app could provide proof of principle.

The STRAND Data app, which will show satellite telemetry on the smartphone's display which can be imaged by an additional camera on-board. This will enable new graphical telemetry to interpret trends.

Postcards from Space and 360 are joint winners, using an app that will take images using the smartphone's camera and use the technology onboard the spacecraft to establish STRaND-1's position.  The public will be able to request their own unique satellite image of Earth through a website, where images can be seen on a map showing where they have been acquired.

The Scream in Space app will make full use of the smartphone's speakers.  Testing the theory 'in space no-one can hear you scream, made popular in the 1979 film 'Alien', the app will allow the public to upload videos of themselves screaming in a creative way to an allocated website.  The most popular videos will be played on the phone while in orbit and the scream recorded using the smartphone's microphone.

Dr Bridges added: 'A smartphone on a satellite like this has never been launched before but our tests have been pretty thorough, subjecting the phone to oven and freezer temperatures, to a vacuum and blasting it with radiation.

'It has a good chance of working as it should, but you can never make true design evolutions or foster innovation without taking a few risks. STRaND is cool because it allows us to do just that.'

The satellite will be commissioned and operated from the Surrey Space Centre's ground station at the University of Surrey.

Being the first smartphone satellite in orbit is just one of many 'firsts' that STRaND-1 is hoping to achieve. Another important mission is the testing of two new propulsion technologies.

The first, known as the Water Alcohol Resisto-jet Propulsion De-orbit Re-entry Velocity Experiment (which benefits from the grand acronym Warp Drive), will use the ejection of a water alcohol mixture to provide thrust.

The second is its Pulsed Plasma Thrusters that use an electric current to heat and ablate a material to produce a charged gas which can then be accelerated by a magnetic field to push the cubesat along.

Although both propulsion systems produce only tiny amounts of thrust they interesting for their fuel efficiency.

Doug Liddle, head of science for SSTL, said: 'We've deliberately asked this enthusiastic and talented young team to do something very non-standard in terms of the timescales, processes and the technologies used to put the satellite together because we want to maximise what we learn from this research programme.

'I can't wait to see what happens next.'

STRaND-2 is already in development.
