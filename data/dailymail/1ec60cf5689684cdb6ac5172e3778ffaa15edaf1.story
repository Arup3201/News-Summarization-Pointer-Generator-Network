Chinese officials have sealed off large parts of a city after a resident who was bitten by a rodent died of bubonic plague.

The 38-year-old victim from the city of Yumen in Gansu province was infected by a marmot, a wild rodent, last week. Reports suggested the marmot was already dead but he chopped it up and fed it to his dog and began suffering from a fever later that day.

Around 30,000 residents have now been told they cannot leave  and police at roadblocks on the perimeter of the city are telling motorists to find alternative routes.

It said 151 people who came into direct contact with the victim have also been placed in quarantine and are being analysed by epidemic prevention teams deployed around the city.

Reports by China Central television say that those in quarantine are in a stable condition and there have been no further cases.

The city is said to have enough rice, flour and oil to supply all its residents for up to one month after setting aside 1 million yuan ($161,200) for emergency vaccinations.

The plague is a bacterial disease spread by the fleas of wild rodents such as marmots. 

While the disease can be effectively treated, patients can die 24 hours after the initial infection, the World Health Organisation says.

Outbreaks in China have been rare in recent years, and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west. 

China's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of Qinghai in 2009, and one in Sichuan in 2012.

Beijing's disease control centre sought to dispel worries about a wider outbreak of the disease in China, saying on its website  that the risk of the disease spreading to the capital was minimal

Prepared: Hundreds of extra emergency service personnel are on standby to try and prevent the outbreak from spreading 

Precautions: Epidemic prevention team trucks have been deployed around the city to prevent an outbreak. The victim was bitten by a wild marmot (file picture right)

Black death: A town crier says 'bring out your dead'

Bubonic plague is one of the most devastating diseases in history, having killed around 100million people during the 'Black Death' in the 14th century.

Drawings and paintings from the outbreak, which wiped out about a third of the European population, depict town criers saying 'bring out your dead' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses.

It is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats.

The disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'.

It kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated, although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive.

After the Black Death arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century.

Bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the rich world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa.

However, there have been a few non-fatal cases in the U.S. in recent years, while in August 2013 a 15-year-old boy died in Kyrgyzstan after eating a groundhog infected with the disease.

Three months later, an outbreak  in a Madagascan killed at least 20 people in a week. A year before 60 people died as a result of the infection, more than in any other country in the world.

Outbreaks in China have been rare in recent years, and most have happened in remote rural areas of the west. 

China's state broadcaster said there were 12 diagnosed cases and three deaths in the province of Qinghai in 2009, and one in Sichuan in 2012. 

In the United States between five and 15 people die every year as a result, mostly in western states.
