A 17-year-old has been charged with the murder of a pizza delivery man who was killed on the job in Alabama last weekend.

Father-of-four Najeh Masaeid, 63, a Jordanian immigrant, was delivering a Dominos order to an apartment building in Birmingham, but when he got there it was vacant.

Corey Arrington Jr is accused of killing Mr Masaeid during a robbery.  

Killed: Najeh Masaeid, 63, was found dead in Brimingham, Alabama, on Sunday while delivering a Dominos pizza, in what police believe was a set-up robbery

Family man: Tributes have been pouring in for Masaeid, a father-of-four who has been described as honorable, hard-working, energetic and funny. A GoFundMe page set up for his family has received over $65,000

He is in custody and undergoing questioning, held on a $100,000 bond for the robbery charge. There is no bond for the murder charge, AL.com reported.

Mr Masaeid's body was found in a hallway, having died of blunt force trauma to the head, in what police believe was a premeditated robbery.

However the owner of the Domino's shop where Masaeid had worked for over 15 years said Masaeid likely only had about $20 on him.

'He came here for the American Dream and it was shattered by American greed,' Masaeid's daughter, Jordan Hosey, told AL.com. 

'Where's the justice in that?' 

'Nothing is free. You work. You pay for what you want. You don't get free.'

'He really valued an honorable dollar.'

Police evacuated the surrounding apartments before going into the one that was on Masaeid's order, only to find it empty.

No one in the building reported anything out of the ordinary.

Mrs Hosey said her father and mother moved to the US almost 20 years ago.

He took a job at Dominos and worked 80 hours a week to afford a modest apartment for his family in Shelby County.

Favorite employee: Masaeid had worked at the same Dominos for 15 years and was loved by his colleagues

Jokester: Masaeid has been described as full of life and someone who could always make a person laugh

Mrs Hosey further explained the story of her father on a GoFundMe page set up to help her mother. 

The family hoped for $25,000, but have already received over $65,000.

Most of the donations are believed to have come from locals who often had pizzas delivered by Masaeid. 

'My dad didn't make much, and I often times paid their bills,' she wrote on the page.

'He never ONCE went to the government for money, although his legal status entitled for him for it. HE never believed in this. His words to me were always "Nothing is free, you work, you pay for what you want, you don't get free".

'My Father was simply trying to earn an honorable dollar. 

Scene: The 63-year-old's body was found in a hallway at The District at The Summit apartment building

Set-up: Police said the person who placed the pizza order did not live at the building and lured Masaeid there

'He didn't feel entitled for it, he worked for it, and it makes me sick to my core how someone felt they were entitled to his money (and drivers never carry much, he always deposits it everytime he runs back to the store) or his life over what? $20? 

'My dads life was ended for $20?

'I can't bear it. I just can't believe it.'

Masaeid will be buried on Christmas Day.

Police are hoping people will information will come forward. 

The death is being investigated as a homicide, according to WIAT.com.

David Daewoud, the owner of the Domino’s where Masaeid worked, said the address of the order Masaeid was delivering was changed at the last minute, which was not unusual, as people often might go to a friend's house and ask the order be delivered there. 

'They’re luxury apartments that you would never think something like that would happen,' Daewould told WIAT.com

'Unfortunately, the caller was a fake order. 

'He was waiting on our driver Najeh by the stairs. And we don’t know all the details yet. 

'We’re waiting on the police report. And the investigator is trying to find out how he was hit.'
