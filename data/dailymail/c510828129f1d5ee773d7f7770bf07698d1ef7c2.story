Nathan Redmond is ready to lead the England Under-21s push for Euro 2015 after being toughened up by the rough and tumble of life in the Championship.

The Norwich City winger will be a key player when Gareth Southgate’s squad go head-to-head over two legs with Croatia for a place in the Czech Republic, starting at Molineux.

Redmond, 20, has been thriving at Norwich and insists he has no regrets after seeing moves to Stoke or West Ham fail to materialise in the summer, as he says the experience of life outside the Barclays Premier League has been invaluable to his development.

Nathan Redmond said life in the Championship means he has gotten used to being roughed up on the pitch

‘I’m finding myself with four men on me at times,’ says Redmond. ‘I expect to be targeted during games or getting a kick every now and then. It’s toughened me up a bit. I can accept a bit of a kick or a nudge in the back now.

‘It helps when we go away to places like Moldova (last month) as you know what’s coming from the foreign players, who like to stamp on your toes or elbow in the back.’

Redmond is accustomed to rough treatment from his early days at Birmingham City. ‘I was only 15 and getting rattled about by Roger Johnson and Stephen Carr,’ he recalls. ‘There was Barry Ferguson and Lee Bowyer too. It was a scary group really. I’d be running over to training and think ‘‘Oh no. . .’’

‘Stephen Carr would smash me from the first minute and said he wouldn’t stop until I learned to deal with it...I haven’t had it easy but it has really helped.’

Redmond has become a fixture in the side under Southgate and says there is a desire among the group not to let a run of nine wins from 10 games in the group stages go to waste.

‘Playing for your country is a big honour for everyone involved, so it’s spurred us on,’ says Redmond. ‘Now I want to qualify for these finals and come up against some of the best teams and win it.’
