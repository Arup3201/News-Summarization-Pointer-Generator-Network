Malik Bendjelloul, the acclaimed Swedish film director behind the Oscar-winning music documentary Searching for Sugar Man has died. He was 36.

Police spokeswoman Pia Glenvik told the Associated Press Bendjelloul died in Stockholm late Tuesday, but wouldn't specify the cause of death, saying only that no crime is suspected.

On Wednesday his brother told a local Swedish paper that he took his own life.

Award-winning documentary filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul committed suicide in Sweden this week after a bout with depression.

Malik Bendjelloul won the Oscar for best documentary for Searching for Sugar Man in February 2013. Police spokeswoman Pia Glenvik said Bendjelloul died in Stockholm late Tuesday, May 13, 2014

'I can confirm that it was suicide and
 that he had been depressed for a short period of time,' his brother 
Johar Bendjellou told Aftonbladet.

'Life is not always so easy... It's the worst. I don't know how to handle it.'

Police would not say where the body was 
found.

His family have asked for privacy.

Searching for Sugar Man, which detailed the life and career of American singer Sixto Rodriguez, won the Oscar for best documentary in 2013.

He also won the BAFTA, Director's Guild of America, Producer's Guild of America, Writer's Guild of America and Sundance audience award.

Bendjelloul grew up in central and southern Sweden as the child of a painter and a translator.

He acted in Swedish TV-series Ebba and Didrik as a child during the 1990s.

He studied journalism and media-production at the Linnaeus University of Kalmar in southern Sweden and later worked as a reporter for Swedish public broadcaster SVT.

He resigned from that job to travel the world and he got the idea for Searching for Sugar Man during one of his trips.

Bendjelloul directed, produced, edited and co-wrote the 2012 film that chronicles two South Africans who set out to find their folk music hero.

Bendjelloul was widely known for his enthusiasm, kindness and high spirits — so the news Wednesday that he had taken his own life shocked colleagues around the world.

'He made a great film and will be missed,' U.S. documentary film maker Michael Moore wrote on Twitter.

British film producer Simon Chinn, who produced 'Searching for Sugar Man,' said he was shocked and deeply saddened by the news of his friend's passing.

'It seems so unbelievable,' Chinn told the AP over the telephone. 'He had everything to live for.'

Chinn said he saw Bendjelloul only two weeks ago in London.

'He was so full of life, hope and optimism and happiness, and looking forward to the future and future collaborations,' he said. 'The idea that he is no longer is just too hard to process.'

He reached out to Chinn when the film was 90 percent finished, but his main sponsor had withdrawn support, saying the film was lousy.

'He just kind of came in with his bounce of enthusiasm and charm and smiling eyes and I was completely won over by him,' Chinn recalled Wednesday.

'He had found this amazing story and was completely determined to do it justice,' he said. 'The fact that no one else believed in it didn't seem to deter him, he just kind of pursued it with incredible passion and tenacity that I hadn't really ever seen before in a filmmaker.'

SVT's culture chief Eva Beckman said his death was incomprehensible.

'One always says it is unbelievable when a young person dies, or when anybody dies, but it is even more unbelievable with Malik,' she said Wednesday. 'Malik was simply such an incredibly alive person.'

Beckman also praised Bendjelloul's strong storytelling skills and his willingness to experiment with new formats.

'What really set him apart from everybody else was his passion for storytelling. He was a fantastic storyteller,' she said. '

'Searching for Sugar Man's' Oscar win led to a career rebirth for Rodriguez, who has been touring major venues in the U.S. and introducing American audiences to the songs he wrote four decades ago.

He was performing Tuesday night in Detroit, but his manager said he wouldn't be commenting on Bendjelloul's death.
