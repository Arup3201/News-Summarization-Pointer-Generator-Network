Chelsea captain John Terry once again got his name on the scoresheet at Stoke, but despite notching for the 15th consecutive campaign, the former England captain is second behind David Unsworth in the list of the top goalscoring Premier League defenders.

Terry showed great body strength and power to hold off his marker Geoff Cameron to put Chelsea on their way to their 13th win of the season at the Britannia Stadium on Monday night.

Throughout his time at Stamford Bridge, the Blues stalwart has netted some crucial strikes, with a total of 35 league goals an impressive tally for a defender.

However, thanks to his penalty-taking prowess, the much-traveled Unsworth has three more strikes to his name and can still claim to be the Premier League's top goalscoring defender.

The most crucial of these goals came on a wet and windy day in South Yorkshire, as a thunderous spot kick sealed a dramatic final day victory over Sheffield United that ensured his Wigan side stayed in the top flight for another season.

The majority of Unsworth's goals came during two stints at Everton, with the robust centre back famously rejoining the Toffees a matter of hours after moving to Aston Villa from West Ham.

Free-kick specialist Ian Harte lies seven behind Terry, but in the twilight of his career at Bournemouth, he is unlikely to catch the Chelsea veteran.

Everton's penalty taker Leighton Baines is a real threat to Terry with 26 goals to his name, while former Arsenal and Chelsea defender William Gallas completes the top five, and is the second highest scorer from open play.

Terry himself has scored several crucial goals for Chelsea throughout his career, and played a major role in several title challenges in the opposition's penalty area.

An equaliser against Arsenal, the then reigning champions, at Highbury in 2004 was certainly vital in helping Chelsea secure their first top flight title in 50 years.

Even more pivotal, Terry's late winner against title rivals Manchester United at Stamford Bridge in 2010 earned the Blues a last-gasp victory as the title race went down to the wire.

And after admitting there is still life in his weary limbs yet, Terry has time to overtake Unsworth, and write himself yet further into Chelsea and Premier League folklore.
