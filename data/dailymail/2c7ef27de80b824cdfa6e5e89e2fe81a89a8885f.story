The Dalai Lama issued a powerful call for personal responsibility yesterday, telling Britons hard work is the answer to economic difficulties.

The exiled Tibetan leader also revealed he was shocked at last summer’s riots because he thought the English were ‘mature, sensible and law-abiding’.

In his first visit to St Paul’s Cathedral, he pointed out that the recession was made by man – not God – and urged Britons to make ‘every effort’ to tackle the difficulties.

He was speaking before receiving the prestigious Templeton Prize for his engagement with science and ability to cross religious boundaries.

Criticising those who complain about problems rather than trying to solve them, he said: ‘Please don’t feel hopeless.

‘Work hard. Don’t just pray. We created the problem – not God.’

Referring to the riots, the Dalai Lama hit out at youngsters who had been brought up to expect an easy life.

He said: ‘Life isn’t easy. There’s no guarantee. If you take for granted that life will be easy, then something will happen and you’ll feel frustration and anger.’

The Dalai Lama expressed disbelief that such large-scale criminality could happen in this country. The scenes of rampaging youths were something he was more used to seeing in third world countries, he said.

‘I always had the view Englishmen were mature people, sensible people, and law-abiding people,’ he added.

‘If such things happen in developing countries, that’s understandable. But in England that happened – I really thought “oh”.

‘I immediately sent a letter to the Prime Minister expressing my sadness and condolences. And I expressed that when the time comes they should make a more serious investigation into what caused this.’

The Dalai Lama, 76, hit out at today’s consumer culture, saying children were ‘brainwashed’ into wanting more than they needed.

‘We put too much emphasis on money,’ he added.

The £1.1million Templeton Prize is the biggest annual award to an individual.

The Dalai Lama is donating £900,000 of the money towards Save the Children’s work with malnourished children in India.

The rest will go towards good causes close to his heart, including science education for student monks in India.

The prize was awarded during a ceremony at the cathedral attended by more than 1,000. The Buddhist leader also had a private meeting with David Cameron and Nick Clegg yesterday.

The Dalai Lama will return to the UK between June 15 and 23 for a series of live question and answer sessions.

Targeting Britain's youth, he will appear at several venues in Scotland, London and Manchester for the 'Stand Up And Be The Change' events.
