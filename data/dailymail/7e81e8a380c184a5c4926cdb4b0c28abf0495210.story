Alex Salmond is under pressure to deliver the ‘speech of his life’ tomorrow as new opinion polls reveal that his independence campaign is faltering.

The First Minister is in Aberdeen for the SNP’s final conference before September’s referendum, where supporters will be bitterly disappointed that movement towards a Yes vote has stalled.

A Survation poll has handed the pro-Union Better Together campaign a comfortable ten-point lead, with backing for independence down two points since last month to just 37 per cent.

Support for a No vote held steady on 47 
per cent, with the findings suggesting that growing numbers of women are
 opposed to leaving the UK.

A separate study for Panelbase, which is the SNP’s favourite pollster as it consistently shows strong backing for separation, puts the Yes vote on 40 per cent – down one point since a poll published at the weekend. The No vote slipped by one point to 45 per cent.

Panelbase also found that even if Scots accept Nationalist claims that their family would be better off – which most studies show is improbable – only slightly over half of adults would vote Yes.

Ahead of Mr Salmond’s keynote speech tomorrow, his deputy Nicola Sturgeon used the conference platform today to make a desperate appeal to Labour voters to back the break-up of Britain.

Around 800,000 traditional Labour voters in the central belt are thought to be key to the referendum result, and Miss Sturgeon claimed that a Yes vote could ‘rejuvenate’ her party’s main rivals.

Her audacious appeal comes as Scotland’s leading elections expert, Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, said the latest polling results give pro-independence campaign leaders a reason to ‘pause for thought’.

‘The No side’s recent apparent nervousness should be steadied a little,’ he said.

Banks face being forced to abandon an independent Scotland or risk losing nearly £300billion from English customers, figures show.

Two-fifths of clients from other parts of the UK would pull their money out of Scottish institutions if there is a Yes vote and no deal is struck to share the pound, according to a poll.

Currency exchange firm UKForex, which commissioned the YouGov survey, estimated Scottish banks would lose £280billion if they did not move south of the Border after independence.

Such a loss of business would be devastating, cutting their balance sheets by more than a third.

It is the latest economic blow to Alex Salmond's separation bid, which has seen finan-cial bodies queue up to raise concerns. Business Secretary Vince Cable has already warned that RBS would abandon its Edinburgh HQ and move to London after separation, a move that would result in the loss of 3,200 jobs north of the Border.

Of 1,622 non-Scots quizzed for UKForex, 42 per cent said they would be 'more likely' to move to an English bank, with 5 per cent saying they would be 'less likely' and 40 per cent saying it would make no difference.

Twice as many thought they would be worse off if Scotland voted for independence than predicted a boost - 16 per cent compared to eight, while 56 per cent thought it would make no difference.

‘In themselves the changes are statistically insignificant. However, this [Survation poll] is the second poll in a row to show that the winter’s increase in Yes support may have come to a halt now that spring finally seems to be with us.

‘That is not the impression the Yes side would like to see created. They would prefer to see their support increase month on month – a movement with apparent sufficient momentum to take them past the winning post by September. They must fear that while the winter’s gains may have been consolidated, their further progress is now stalled.’

Professor Curtice added: ‘The SNP gather in Aberdeen this weekend for their spring conference. Activists will be hoping that Mr Salmond gives the speech of his life. It is certainly not an opportunity he can afford to waste.’

Survation sampled 1,002 people aged 16 and over in Scotland from April 4-to-7. Results have been compared with a previous Survation poll between March 6 and 7.

The findings show that support for separation among women has fallen by 4 points since the last survey, dropping from 32.5 per cent to just 28.5 per cent.

Panelbase sampled 1,024 people aged 16 and over from April 4-to-9, and results were compared with a previous Panelbase poll in March.

Better Together leader Alistair Darling said: ‘It's no surprise that Scots are rejecting Alex Salmond's negative and divisive campaign when he won't tell us what would replace the pound or how our essential public services, like schools and hospitals, would be funded.

‘There can be no complacency from those of us who want Scotland to remain in the UK. We will do everything we can to convince those who have yet to make up their mind that we are stronger and better together as part of the UK.’

But Yes Scotland chief executive Blair Jenkins said: ‘These are extremely encouraging findings, which show that the referendum is wide open.

‘On these new (Panelbase) figures, Yes just needs a three-point swing to move ahead - and we are very confident of achieving success in September.’

Miss Sturgeon will say today: ‘To every Labour voter in the country, I say this: the Yes campaign is not asking you to leave your party. Instead it offers you the chance to get your party back.

‘An independent Scotland will not mean the end of Labour, but might mean a rejuvenated Labour – a Labour Party free to make its own decisions, a Labour Party that no longer needs to dance a Westminster tune.

‘For everyone out there with Labour in your heart, the message is clear – don’t vote No to stop the SNP, vote Yes to reclaim the Labour Party.’

Miss Sturgeon also announced an extra £1million for foodbanks in Scotland as she courts the left-wing vote.

Despite the slump in support for separation, SNP activists will be delighted with the party political polling results in the Survation study.

The Nationalists are on 44.9 per cent in the constituency vote for the next Holyrood election, with Labour trailing on 32.1 per cent – down nearly two points since March. The Tories are up 0.5 percentage points to 13.5 per cent, with the LibDems on 5.7 per cent.

SNP business convener Derek Mackay said: ‘The fall in Labour support will undoubtedly set alarm bells ringing there, and raise further questions about Johann Lamont's leadership.’

But Drew Smith, Labour's constitutional spokesman, said: ’This is both desperate and dishonest from Nicola Sturgeon who will clearly say anything to persuade people to vote to break up the United Kingdom.

‘Nicola Sturgeon has been campaigning against Labour all her political life, in good times, and in bad times, and when we were lifting children and pensioners out of poverty, she still argued for nationalism.

‘The Scottish Labour Party works in partnership with people all over the UK and beyond who share our values of fairness and equality and we reject Nicola Sturgeon's narrow politics of division and grievance.

‘Perhaps Nicola Sturgeon would be better concentrating her campaigning efforts on the one in three SNP voters who don't believe in separation.’
