Cincinnati Bengals star Devon Still shared the heartwarming news on Wednesday that his daughter Leah's cancer was in remisison

Leah has been been battling stage 4 Neuroblastoma since last June, and captured the hearts of millions as she fights the disease

'Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION!' wrote Still on his Instagram

He went on to say; 'After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her.'

He then went on to thank everyone from the doctors who helped his daughter to those who wrote her notes and everyone who shared her story. 

Leah's journey has been followed by millions since she first began receiving treatment last June at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

In September she had a tumor removed from her abdomen, and last month received what could be her final round of chemotherapy.

She has also stayed remarkably active, walking in the Levi's Kids fashion show during New York Fashion Week in February and appearing in a music video for the song Truly Brave, a mashup of the Sara Bareilles song Brave and the Cyndi Lauper classic True Colors that was commissioned by Today anchor Hoda Kotb to raise funds for pediatric cancer research.

In addition, she and her father have written a children's book to help other kids that are going through cancer treatment.

The Bengals kept Still on their practice squad during the preseason so he could spend time with his daughter and receive their medical insurance

Last November, the Bengals presented a check for $1.3million to the Children's Hospital in Cincinnati for pediatric cancer treatment and research, money raised from the sale of Still jerseys.

The team also honored Leah during a ceremony as well, and for the first time ever the young girl was actually able to attend a game since she had begun her treatment - and see her father play.

The Bengals also helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. 

And they kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage.  

June 2, 2014 and March 25, 2015 are days I will remember for the rest of my life. As everyone probably knows, June 2nd was the day doctors walked into the waiting room to tell me my daughter had cancer. It was the most devastating day of my life. March 25th , however, is feeling like the best day of my life. 

Today we received news from Leah's oncologist that her cancer, stage four neuroblastoma, is officially in REMISSION! After 296 days of day dreaming about what it would feel like to hear the doctors say my daughter is in remission, I finally know the feeling. 

Funny thing is there is really no way of describing it because I never knew this feeling existed. When I look at my daughter all I can do is smile and hug her. It was not easy but every day, and every treatment Leah fought like hell and kicked cancers butt! I'm so proud and blessed to call her my daughter. 

She has made an impact on me and on the world, at the age of four, that I can only wish to make in a lifetime. Thank you to my family and friends for the support through all those tough days. Thank you to everyone who has sent a letter to give Leah and our family motivation to keep fighting, a toy that helped Leah get through her days in the hospital, and more importantly a prayer that helped God hear our cries for healing. 

Thank you to the doctors at CHOP for putting together the best plan of action for my daughter. Thank you to Child Life members Sarah, Laura, and Lindsey for really turning what could be a scary place into a place where Leah would enjoy going because she knew she would have fun with you guys. 

Thank you to the Bengals for taking on my situation and standing by me and my family and for helping to raise money to fight pediatric cancer. To every media outlet and persons that helped raise much needed awareness, thank you. 

Leah is not done with treatments yet. She still needs more to make sure the cancer cells do not return and to build back up her immune system and other damage from the chemo but I know my little warrior will get through it!
