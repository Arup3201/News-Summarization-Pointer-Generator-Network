Ellie Thompson took so many tablets in her fight against cancer that her mother described her as a human ‘rattle’.

On top of the gruelling chemotherapy treatment, the 11-year-old needed nearly 50 tablets, medicines and ointments a week to combat the wide variety of side effects.

It meant her battle against leukaemia became like a military operation.

Ellie was on so many medications that her mother, Lindsey, branded her the 'human rattle'. She required treatment to combat the effects of the chemotherapy which ranged from nosebleeds to dry skin

She was diagnosed after she and her brother, Josh, eight, both developed chest infections and her cough failed to improve. Tests showed her white blood cell count was low, and at the start of 2012 she became very unwell

The family put up a large whiteboard 
that filled an entire wall in the dining room and wrote down a detailed 
schedule, with every type of medicine, dose required and time of day to 
be taken clearly set out.

It was also vital Ellie was suitably 
hydrated to protect her kidneys from the strong medicines and the board 
was used to keep a tally of her drinks of water.

Thankfully the treatment and her careful tablet-taking worked well.

Ellie was treated at Sheffield Children's Hospital where she underwent a gruelling course of chemotherapy which left her so weak that she had to spend most of the last two years in a wheelchair

She was given the all-clear from 
cancer a few weeks ago and is now delighted to be off her medication and
 planning a return to school.

Her mother Lindsey Thompson, 33, a 
nursery nurse, said that at one stage Ellie had to take 11 pills in a 
single dose and ‘put them all on one spoon’.

She continued: ‘I used to say she would rattle, she was taking that many tablets.

‘We drew a weekly timetable because 
she was taking tablets at different times of the day and we were so 
worried we were going to mix up her doses.

The chemotherapy was lowering her 
immune system which was making her really susceptible to all different 
kinds of infections and illnesses.’

Ellie, from Sheffield, was diagnosed 
with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in February 2011 after she appeared 
to fail to recover from a chest infection.

Mrs Thompson, her businessman husband Carl, 38, and their son Josh, eight, were shattered by the news.

The schoolgirl immediately started two years of treatment at Sheffield Children’s Hospital and she is now on the mend.

Mrs Thompson said: ‘The hospital have
 been amazing, they scooped us up and told us what they were going to 
do. From then on you don’t have time to think about it.’

Although Ellie will need check-ups for years to come, doctors say she is in remission.

‘She can come off treatment and this huge amount of medication and get back to normal life,’ said Mrs Thompson.

As a result of the treatment and medication, Ellie (pictured with brother Josh and father, Carl), developed unusual food cravings and would ask for Sunday roasts late at night. However, when provided with the food she was often unable to eat anything

The family (L to R: Josh, Lindsey, Carl and Ellie) are now looking forward to their lives getting back to normal and Ellie, who has missed a year of school, if looking forward to starting Year 7 in September
