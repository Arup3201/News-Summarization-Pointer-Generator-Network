A 12-year-old boy had a lucky escape after a glass table close to his bed spontaneously exploded. 

Adam Hodges had just left his bedroom in Basildon in Essex to go for breakfast when the table exploded, leaving thousands of sharp shards of glass embedded in the wall and door.

The table was near the boy's bed and next to a radiator which may have caused it to spontaneously shatter through a reaction known as 'thermal shock.'

Adam Hodges, 12, narrowly escaped being injured after a table in his bedroom spontaneously exploded, leaving thousands of shards of glass embedded in the walls and doors of his room in Basildon in Essex 

Adam's father Nick Hodges, 41, said the explosion sounded like a gunshot and his son would certainly have been injured had he been in the room on Sunday morning. 

When he heard the loud bang Mr Hodges went up to the bedroom and saw thousands of pieces of glass, most of them sharp and measuring up to half an inch, embedded in the wall and door of the room.

'All of a sudden there was a terrific bang - like a gunshot,' said Mr Hodges. 

'We went up to have a look and there was glass everywhere.

'The glass was still crackling like a log on a fire.

'There was glass embedded in the door and wall.'

Mr Hodges said a computer monitor, keyboard and printer had been placed on the table and none of the items were very heavy. 

He had bought the Ikea table for his son about a year ago for £60 from Ikea in Lakeside in Thurrock, Essex. It had taken two people to lift and position the hefty piece of furniture close to a radiator in his bedroom.

Mr Hodges said had his son been in the room he would probably have been hurt by the sharp pieces of glass 

'If it had happened at night, in the dark, and my son had woken up and got out of bed without shoes on, he would have suffered cuts,' added Mr Hodges. 

It is thought the table may have exploded because of thermal shock, where temperature changes over time can cause parts of an object to expand by different amounts. 

Ikea agreed to pay the family £100 in compensation.

The family bought the table for £60 last year and have been offered £100 in compensation after it exploded 

A spokesman said: 'The safety of our products is always the highest priority and our entire range is tested rigorously.

'Whenever we learn of a possible fault with the design, material or manufacture, we investigate immediately and thoroughly.

'We have already been in contact with Mr Hodges to apologise and are investigating the matter further.'
