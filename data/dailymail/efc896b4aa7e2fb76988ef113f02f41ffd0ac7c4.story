While a cut and blow-dry with the super stylist will set you back around £300, he has created a video showing you how to achieve glossy locks at home. 

George teamed up with Pinterest after noticing how many of his customers were using the social media site to garner inspiration for their next cut. 

'Lots of people are pinning their ideas for the party season,' he explains. 'So many girls come into the salon with mood boards they've created using the site, taking inspiration from models and celebrities, so we've put together these tutorials to help you achieve party-proof hair.'

George, with the help of stylist Lottie O'Shea, shows us how to achieve the 'perfect supermodel blow-dry'.

'This is often worn by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and looks really effortlessly sexy and cool,' adds George.

So, how do you emulate the look? Start with freshly washed wet hair and prep your locks with plenty of volume spray. Then, split hair into three sections: left, right and top.

Next, take your hairdryer and blast the hair 90 per cent dry, pushing the hair up around the crown for lift and pushing the front section forward.

To frame and flatter the face, blow-dry the hair line forward with a round ceramic brush. Blast the hair out with the hairdryer to give it that natural movement worn so well by George's model clients.

If your hair is all one length, George advises uses tongs  to give definition before spritzing with Redken shine spray to finish. Voila! supermodel hair in just a few short steps.

No party look is complete without a glamorous makeover and the A-listers rely on one woman to give them glowing skin and contoured cheekbones.

Charlotte Tilbury is the make-up artist that gave Amal Clooney her bridal beauty and Kim Kardashian her flawless glow so FEMAIL have called on the image guru to share her beautifying tips.

Charlotte, who also works with Abbey Clancy, Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne, has created The Supermodel look; a scheme inspired by all the supermodels that she has worked with.

She shares her step-by-step guide to getting the look.

Charlotte said the make-up was, 'inspired by the heavenly supermodels of the 1990s and the trailblazing icons of today’s catwalk, from Linda, Cindy, Claudia, Helena and Naomi to Kate, Cara, Jourdan, Joan and Miranda.

'The Supermodel is channelling the legendary make-up of these perfect, glamazon women who understand the power of the ultimate smoky eye paired with a sultry nude lip look.

'The sensuous smoky eyes, the killer cheekbones and the glossy, nude kissable lips that we all want.

'This look is like that chic little black dress that you can always fall back on, every time you put it on, you know you look gorgeous, glamorous and fabulous.'

Charlotte always preps her celebrity friends' skin with her own Magic Cream -which was named by the models backstage at fashion week - followed by her Wonder Glow primer, foundation and  concealer, The Retoucher, to give  a healthy glow.

She then brushes up the brows and uses a highlighter just below the arch of the brow.

'This is an old make-up artist trick that accentuates and lifts the brows,' explains Charlotte. This step is followed by lashings of jet black mascara. 

To achieve the A-listers' sultry smoky eye, Charlotte uses her Luxury Eyeshadow Palette in Fallen Angel.

Priming with a Champagne eyeshadow, she then uses a beige colour in the corner and applies it using a brush in a 'windscreen wiper' motion.

'You can use it wet for a dramatic effect, just pop a little bit of water on to your brush and apply the shadow for a really intense shade,' she adds.

She uses eyeliner along the lash line and finishes with a little feline flick. 'Smudge some smoky shadow under the eyeline to add width to the eye,' she advises.

She then advises women to suck in their cheeks so a natural shadow appears and to apply bronzer there.

She goes on to explain the importance of lip liner. 'Every supermodel is never without their lipliner' she says before outlining Abbey's lips and slicking on  her K.I.S.S.I.N.G lipstick. 

'Always leave the blusher until last so you never overdo it,' she adds. 

As well as working backstage at the most esteemed fashion shows, Charlotte is credited with transforming the likes of Millie Mackintosh, Suki Waterhouse and Margot Robbie. 

Poppy Delevingne even called on her to do her bridal make-up for her wedding earlier this year.
