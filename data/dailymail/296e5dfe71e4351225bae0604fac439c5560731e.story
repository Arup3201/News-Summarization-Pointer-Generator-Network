A bride who stole almost £200,000 from her boss to fund a lavish wedding was jailed for 20 months yesterday.

Kirsty Lane, 29, was caught out after she invited managing director Peter Sutton to the expensive event.

He became suspicious when his part-time accounts clerk laid on a 
harpist, personalised fireworks, food by an award-winning chef and a 
free bar for 100 guests at her nuptials in a mock-Tudor banqueting hall.

Fraud: Kirsty Lane stole up to £200,000 from her company to pay for her lavish wedding to Graham Lane, 36, and was today jailed for 20 months

A closer look at the accounts then revealed she had been ripping off his firm for more than two years.

Yesterday Lane, who was arrested before she had a chance to leave for her honeymoon in Mexico, was jailed after admitting ten counts of fraud.

Afterwards Mr Sutton told how her ‘unbridled greed’ had almost ruined his video conferencing business.

‘I trusted her implicitly and this was how she repaid us,’ he said. ‘The wedding was the most lavish thing I’ve ever seen.’

Preston Crown Court heard that as 
Kirsty Rimmer, the bride-to-be had worked for four years for Pure AV in 
Leyland, Lancashire, earning less than £15,000 a year.

All the directors were invited to her wedding to Graham Lane, 36, who 
she also kept in the dark about her crimes, in January last year.

The 
event at the Great Hall at Mains, near Blackpool, cost up to £40,000.

Guests were served canapés with Buck’s fizz before a wedding breakfast 
provided by celebrity chef Paul Heathcote’s firm.

The bridesmaids were given jewel-encrusted iPods to take home, while 
they and Mrs Lane even had matching black Ugg boots to protect them from
the cold when photographs were taken outside.

The evening ended with a 
fireworks display featuring the couple’s initials illuminated as the 
centrepiece.

They left in a white limousine for a ‘minimoon’ in the Lake District before their honeymoon in Mexico.

But within days of the wedding Mr Sutton was alerted to a problem with an invoice.

On investigating, his suspicions aroused by the lavish wedding,  he 
discovered that Lane, who has a daughter from a previous relationship, 
had been using real invoices to existing suppliers to create extra 
payments into her own account.

The hearing was told she made 122 payments to herself between December 2008 and January 2011.

Around £122,000 went into her own account, with £70,000 going into her 
future husband’s account and a further £6,000 paid into a third account.

Kirsten McAteer, prosecuting, said: ‘Once she started stealing money, 
she couldn’t stop. She was afraid Mr Lane would leave her when he found 
out the truth.’

The court heard that Mr Lane, who met his wife in 2007, was acquitted of
any wrongdoing at a trial in May. He believed the money was from 
savings, her salary and bonuses.

As well as the wedding, Lane spent the cash on other luxuries including a
52in TV, a Tag Heuer watch and a jewel-encrusted case for her iPad.

Jailing Lane, Judge Pamela Badley said her behaviour was ‘fraudulent 
from the outset’, adding: ‘This was a cynical exploitation of the small 
company for which you worked.’

Two people lost their jobs as a result of the firm’s ‘cashflow’ struggles following Lane’s fraud.

Mr Sutton said that, due to added tax and VAT payments, she had cost the
company, which employs 18 staff, a total of around £300,000.

He added: ‘How it didn’t sink us I don’t know. It is only through the 
sheer determination of the rest of the team that we are still here.’
