A pair of documentary filmmakers have hit on a gimmick to attract viewers that should put 3D to shame, by promising free marijuana at screenings of their new movie.

The appropriately named director Anthony Hashem and producer Adam Hartle announced the giveaway in conjunction with screenings of documentary Mile High: The Comeback of Cannabis.

The film chronicles Colorado's legalization of recreational marijuana.

'I'll be standing outside the Mayan and Boulder theaters before each screening this week, handing out a small amount of legal marijuana to anyone over 21 with a valid ID to take home and enjoy

responsibly,' Hartle told Deadline.

'No purchase necessary,' he added. 'But we highly encourage you to stay and watch the film.'

The film follows the legislation efforts to pass and implement Colorado's Amendment 46, which created a system for growing, distributing, and selling legal marijuana.

It also features vignettes of Hartle's stand-up comedy.

'We’ve shown this film to a few test audiences so far, and what we’ve found is the 20- to 40-year-old demographic who have used cannabis before absolutely love it, and the older crowd who hasn’t find it less favorable,' Hashem said.

The film opens Tuesday at Denver's Mayan Theatre.

Tongue in cheek, Deadline noted that rather than complain about the new incentive, theater owers may hope for it to hike concession sales.

Sadly there are no 4:20 p.m. showtimes.
