A man dubbed the 'Hounslow Slasher' is facing jail today after confessing to random knife attacks on two women.

Sasha Masamba, 20, grabbed the victims from behind and cut then across the neck or face as they walked in the street.

The first, 19 year-old Kaja Zablocka, was slashed across the neck in Hanworth Road, Hounslow, and ran away laughing shortly before midnight on 7 August last year.

Ten days later Masamba slashed the face of Deserilyn Aurelio, 26, after grabbing her in Whitton Road, Hounslow, at around 1.30am.

He was arrested on August 21 by a police officer on a high-visibility patrol at Hounslow train station.

Masamba, of Hounslow, west London, was charged with two counts of attempted murder.

He appeared at the Old Bailey to plead guilty to the alternative charges of grievous bodily harm with intent.

Grievous bodily harm: Masamba slashed the face of Deserilyn Aurelio (above), 26, after grabbing her in Whitton Road, Hounslow, at around 1.30am

The prosecution accepted the pleas after consultation with the victims.

Masamba will be sentenced on April 9 after a psychiatric report is prepared.

Sasha Masamaba was snared after a police officer with only four weeks service spotted him at Hounslow train station on August 21.

The un-named woman police constable recognised him from CCTV images she had seen and he was arrested.

DCI Amanda Hargreaves of the Homicide & Serious Crime Command said: ‘Although we do not fully understand Masamba’s motive for these senseless attacks, I have no doubt that he would have continued to pose a serious threat to women had he not been caught.

‘Masamba was not previously known to police, but he was caught through the hard work of detectives, the availability of CCTV footage and the diligence of the additional officers on patrol in Hounslow.’
