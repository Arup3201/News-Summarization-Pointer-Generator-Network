Could you imagine living without ever hearing music? Concerts and songs are often taken for granted by many people with full hearing, but its an activity deaf people can't enjoy in the same way. 

Vodafone recently teamed up with Dutch composer Kyteman to create a song designed specifically to help people who have a limited range of hearing experience a live musical performance. 

The concert was then performed to 19-year-old Vera van Dijk who was born deaf, and wears a cochlear implant to boost the sounds she can hear.

The concert of 400 people was created as part of the Vodafone Firsts scheme.

To ensure the sounds were audible to Ms van Dikl, the song was composed from scratch using the frequencies her cochlear implant enables her to hear.

Vera started to hear a small number of musical notes when she received the implant two years ago.

Because she had limited awareness of the type of music she may like, she asked the public to help her choose the song, via social media. 

They chose Stay With Me by Sam Smith.

Ms van Dijk was also able to lip-read and communicate on her phone, to encourage friends and followers to listen to sample scores of music.

This was another first for the teenager, who previously was only able to use a mobile phone to communicate by text.

Before the concert Vera took part in one physical and one virtual recording session with Kyteman.

The first, in Kyteman’s studio, was shared via a video call with her brother Kasper, who is a musician himself.

The virtual studio session, took place on Vera’s phone, helping Kyteman to fine-tune his composition, which was played by an 18-piece orchestra, to match Vera’s hearing abilities.

Speaking at the event, Vera said: ‘My night couldn't get any better! 

'The way Kyteman conducted his orchestra and created the purest sound gave me goosebumps.

‘And the atmosphere was amazing, I had such a good time with my family and friends. Even though I will never hear exactly the same as everyone else, tonight I felt that I came extremely close. 

'The melodies were so diverse and I would have never been able to distinguish the different sounds if it wasn't for Kyteman. I’m over the moon!’

Kyteman said: ‘It has been overwhelming to see how devoted the audience has been.

'It was definitely a challenge to arrange the song for Vera, but when I saw her enjoying every moment during the concert, I knew it was mission accomplished.’

Audiologist Louise Hart from the UK’s largest hearing loss charity Action on Hearing Loss, formerly RNID, added: ‘Cochlear implants, which Vera now wears, can be an option for people who have little or no hearing and are not benefiting from hearingaids.

'They can improve people's ability to hear and understand speech however the results of cochlear implants vary depending on the individual.

‘It’s great that Vera was able to enjoy her first musical experience with the help of Kyteman through Vodafone Firsts.’

Because she had limited awareness of the type of music she may like, Ms van Dijk asked the public, via social media, to choose the song.  Ms van Dijk was also able to lip-read her brother Kasper on her phone (pictured) and communicate in a more direct way than before - another first for the teenager

Kyetman's version sounds lower than the original, (above) but is still recognisable to people with full hearing
