Elizabeth Outram, who was 'dreading exposure on national TV', killed herself on her 30th birthday, an inquest heard

A young woman who was 'dreading exposure on national TV' after  switching the price tags on a jacket from TK Maxx, killed herself on her 30th birthday, an inquest heard.

Elizabeth Outram was found hanged  at her home in Hackney, east London, after a night celebrating with friends at the Shard.

An inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court was reportedly told that before her death she had been charged with fraud after she swapped the price tags on a leather jacket at the Brighton branch of discount department store TK Maxx.

A television crew following a police operation in Brighton filmed Miss Outram being led out of the shop after she had attempted to buy the jacket for a friend's rock-themed hen party. 

Miss Outram's sister Alexandra, 31, told the inquest her sister had been traumatised by the incident and was hounded by Renegade Pictures production company. 

'She was traumatised by it and was filmed by a production company, I think it was Renegade productions company, they hounded her,' her sister told the inquest. 

'They kept sending her messages and calling her. She called them up pretending to be me, she was too ashamed to tell me initially but I would have done the same. She called telling them to leave her alone.

'At that point she told them she was receiving psychiatric treatment and she wasn't well but it was just ignored.'

Miss Outram reportedly attempted to take her own life in August 14 last year when she was due to appear in court to face the charges.

Her sister said there should have been more support for someone with a history of severe mental health problems. 

'She was made to go to court, even though she was going through a really difficult espisode and that is when she took the first overdose,' Miss Outram's sister told the inquest.

She was said to have been 'traumatised' by the incident and was 'hounded' by Renegade Pictures productions company, according to her sister

'She ran out of medication, they couldn't give her more than a week's dose.

'This was the time when she really needed some kind of intervention from healthcare services, I don't know why I was never contacted ever, I only found out about this through her, why did no one contact me?

'They had my details, I know it's private but it's a suicide attempt, she was on her own. 

'For someone who has a history of severe mental health problems and suicide attempts, I don't know why this case was treated this way,

'She had extreme social anxiety, it was a constant battle for her to leave the house and I saw it, I saw her really struggling.

'I just think there should have been more support for her.' 

The inquest heard that around the time of the hen party, Miss Outram's mental health had improved, only to deteriorate after TK Maxx incident.

It is understood that the footage will not be broadcast.

After the inquest, Alexandra told the Evening Standard that her sister, who was 'embarrassed' by the incident, had been filmed by the crew as shop staff questioned her over the tags - even though she had asked the camera team not to.

'She said 'You can't film me', and they said 'We can'. She said she was ill, but they did not call her carer - me,' Alexandra said.  

Coroner Mary Elizabeth Hassell recorded a verdict of suicide.

She said: 'She was 30 and reflecting on her life. She had an appalling experience and was dreading exposure on national TV.

'Despite making headway with her health, and despite having a very loving family, it wasn't enough.'

A spokesman for Renegade Pictures production company said: 'Only a brief part of the shoplifting incident was filmed, outside the shop as Elizabeth was led to a police car by officers. No filming of Elizabeth took place inside the shop. 

'Soon after her arrest, the production team were contacted and made it clear that neither she nor the incident involving her would be referred to in any way in the series to be broadcast. The production team never had contact details for Elizabeth and never attempted to contact her. 

'Following Elizabeth's very sad death the production team again reassured her sister that she would not feature in any way in the series and passed on their sincere condolences for their tragic loss.' 

She was found hanged at her home in Malvern Road, London Fields, after a night out to celebrate the milestone birthday at the Shard on September 11 last year
