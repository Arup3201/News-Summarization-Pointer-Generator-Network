NatWest and RBS online banking today stopped working for the second time in a week thanks to an apparent cyber-attack, in the latest blow to the State-owned financial giant.

Thousands were left unable to pay for their purchases on 'Cyber Monday' four days ago after the group's cashpoints and online services suddenly crashed.

And today customers were again shut out of their accounts when the Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest websites seemed to become inaccessible.

The company blamed the error on a so-called 'DDoS attack', which occurs when hackers deliberately overwhelm a site by sending millions of requests for access all at the same time.

Crash: NatWest's website has been hit with major technical problems for the second time this week

Dozens of the banks' users took to Twitter to complain that they could not access the company's websites.

Some even suggested that the problems were once again affecting cash machines, claiming they were unable to withdraw money.

NatWest's website went down around 11.30am, leading to floods of online complaints, and stayed offline for an hour.

The bank's official Twitter account advised customers to follow an alternative link - goo.gl/ZPDdZ - to access online banking, suggesting that the problem related to the website's homepage.

The RBS site was also reported to have crashed, although it was apparently working again after a few minutes.

Complaints: Multiple users took to Twitter to complain that the banks' websites had crashed

Hayley Davis told MailOnline: 'I was just trying to log on to move some money but the website is down. I called NatWest customer care who didn't know about it - the gentleman I spoke to said he hoped it wasn't down, because he banked with them and needed to get online himself!

'He went off to check and came back to confirm, apologised and said they didn't know when it would be back on.'

A spokesman for the banking group said: 'Due to a surge in internet traffic deliberately directed at the NatWest website, customers experienced difficulties accessing some of our customer websites today.

'This deliberate surge of traffic is commonly known as a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. We have taken the appropriate action to restore the affected web sites.

'At no time was there any risk to customers. We apologise for the inconvenience caused.'

The bank has given no indication as to who could have been behind the attack, nor why it was targeted.

Troubles: On Monday, RBS's systems crashed, leading to chaos for customers who could not access money

Jesse Moore wrote on Twitter: 
'NatWest website down from three internet connections. Mobile app not 
working, given up. Time to switch.'

RBS
customer Eilish Bennett claimed that she was unable to use her bank 
card, tweeting: 'My bank card won't work and I can't withdraw a penny.' 
It is not known whether or not this was related to the web problems.

On Monday supermarket trolleys full of food were abandoned, mothers were unable to buy milk for babies and motorists could not purchase fuel as RBS's payment systems crashed completely.

Customers were unable to use their debit or credit cards, with some told they had gone into overdraft because payments could not be processed.

The computer glitch lasted for around three hours, and affected cash machines, smartphone apps and websites belonging to RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank.

RBS chief executive Ross McEwan apologised for the technical problems which plagued 'Cyber Monday', said to be the biggest online shopping day of the year.

He blamed it on years of underinvestment into the bank's computer systems, and vowed to 'do better' in the future.

The problems have rekindled memories of the meltdown the bank suffered in the summer of 2012, which delivered days of disruption for customers.

A technical glitch millions saw unable to access their salaries in what was branded one of the biggest IT failures at a UK bank.

The British Government owns 81 per cent of RBS Group, and the string of issues affecting customers could harm its attempts to reduce its stake and return the bank to the private sector.

If you're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching, there are plenty of incentives to move.This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are.

Top deals include  Halifax Reward Account promising new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit.

First Direct pays
£100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, 
the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a
further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 
months.

Santander's 123 current account, on the other hand, pays interest on in-credit balances
- 1 per cent on balances between £1,000 and £2,000, 2 per cent between 
£2,000 and £3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £3,000 and £20,000.

Nationwide FlexDirect offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £2,500 for the first year, while its FlexAccount delivers free travel insurance.
