A 43-year-old man has been sentenced to 20 years jail after impregnating a 13-year-old girl.

Cesar Solis was convicted of statutory rape on Thursday at Cobb Superior Court in Atlanta after a three-day trial.

The girl gave birth in June and tests showed Solis was the father.

He was originally charged with rape but convicted of the lesser charge of statutory rape.

According to CBS, Solis had been living with the victim's family in Austell in 2012.

The victim told police that one morning while she was getting ready for school, Solis raped her.

The girl said he made threats against her to prevent her from telling her family, but when the girl discovered she was pregnant, she told her mother.

Solis was arrested and has been held without bond since December 25, 2012.

At Solis' trial the defense argued that Solis and the girl were having a relationship and that sex was consensual.

Jurors convicted Solis of the lesser crime of statutory rape.

Cobb Superior Court Chief Judge Adele Grubbs gave Solis the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

According to ATlaw, Solis' attorney Matthew Hines said the state failed to prove its case for rape, which would have carried a maximum sentence of life in prison.

Hines said there was a relationship between his client and the 13-year-old with phone records showing calls he made to her from jail.

'She was consistently talking with him,' Hines said.

There is also an immigration hold on Solis. He will be eligible for parole in 12 years.
