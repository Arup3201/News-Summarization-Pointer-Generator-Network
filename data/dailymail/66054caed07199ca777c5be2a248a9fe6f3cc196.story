He is renowned for his skills on the pitch, but now Cristiano Ronaldo has revealed his talents stretch further than football.

The highest paid footballer in the world couldn't resist the chance to show off after a Japanese manufacturer asked him to promote their facial exerciser ball.

Ronaldo, 29, who plays for Real Madrid, appears in a bizarre 30-second video advertising the Facial Fitness Pao which involves nodding excitedly while biting down on a ball.

But Ronaldo does appear to have some standards, and instead of putting it in his mouth, he gives it his winning grin and does a few kick-ups before letting the others do the hard work.

The product description on the company’s website says the movement will exercise your facial muscles and keep your smile bright – just like Ronaldo’s.

The video, which has been uploaded to YouTube, has already had nearly one million hits.

Ronaldo, who celebrated in May when his team landed the Holy Grail of ‘La Decima’ – their tenth European championship, is no stranger to scoring advertising deals.

Earlier this year he appeared on the front cover of Vogue with nothing but his girlfriend Irina Shayk to cover his modesty.

The best player on the planet can't resist showing off a few ball skills

Unlike the other people in the video who put the facial exerciser in their mouths, Ronaldo refuses

But the sex god image he has so carefully maintained may have gone out of the window in this embarrassing video.

Still, there’s no denying he’s got brand appeal. British magazine SportsPro listed him as the fourth most marketable athlete of 2014.

He takes home around £17m every year through his salary from Real Madrid and endorsements with big-name companies including Armani and Nike.

Next week he will return to grandstanding his ball skills on the pitch, when Real Madrid take on Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup in Cardiff.
