When Frank Lampard came on as a late substitute for Manchester City on Wednesday night he broke the record for most appearances in the knockout stages of the Champions League.

The former Chelsea midfielder was thrown on in the 87th minute by manager Manuel Pellegrini, in what is likely to be his last ever Champions League game, as City were dumped out by Barcelona after a 3-1 aggregate defeat in the last 16.

It was Lampard's 52nd match in the latter stages of Europe's top club competition moving him one clear of a group of four players.

Lampard is unlikely to add to his tally as he prepares to join New York City in the summer

Cristiano Ronald Ronaldo will overtake Lampard if he plays in both legs of Real Madrid's quarter-final

Iker Casillas could also overtake the former England international following completion of the last-eight tie

Real Madrid pair Cristiano Ronaldo and Iker Casillas, Barcelona midfiedler Xavi and Manchester United goalkeeper Victor Valdes are all tied on 51 appearances in the knockout stage.

Lampard, who won the competition with Chelsea in 2012, is only likely to hold the record for less than one month with Ronaldo, Casillas and Xavi, to a lesser extent, set to feature for their sides in next month's quarter-finals.

Former England international Lampard will join New York City in the summer and, barring an unlikely return to Europe, will not get the chance to add to his tally of Champions League knockout games.

John Terry and Andres Iniesta are the only other two players in the top 10 that are still playing, while Lionel Messi just misses out on the list.

The Barcelona forward is on 45 appearances, however, and is almost certain to make his way towards the top in the coming seasons.

Lionel Messi is currently on 45 knockout appearances and should make the top 10 after the quarter-finals

Xavi was an unused sub against Man City but could still add to his tally this season
