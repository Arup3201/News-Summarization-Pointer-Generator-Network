Bloated beyond recognition, with his long hair dyed blond and sporting a grey goatee, notorious conman Peter Foster – a former friend of Cherie Blair – was dramatically arrested in Australia yesterday after a year on the run.

His dishevelled appearance was a stark contrast to the sharp figure he cut while promoting his worthless Bai Lin Tea slimming products in Britain more than 30 years ago.

The 52-year-old self-confessed ‘international man of mischief’, who later became the central figure in the infamous 2002 Cheriegate scandal, was pounced on by police at his hideout near the New South Wales holiday town of Byron Bay.

As they wrestled him to the ground one of the officers was heard to warn his colleagues: ‘He’s got a gun!’ In fact, Foster was unarmed.

He was quickly subdued and dragged away to a police van – but the first stop wasn’t a police cell.

Instead, the fugitive was taken to hospital after he suffered what a police spokesman described as ‘a turn’, the nature of which was not known, while being arrested.

Foster is expected to appear before a Brisbane court in the next few days to face a sentencing hearing for his involvement in a weight loss scheme – he is banned from taking part in any such schemes in Australia. A Queensland judge has already decided he will go to jail for three years.

But because Foster failed to appear in court for the sentencing hearing late last year and was judged to be in contempt of court, after which he remained ‘on the run’ for a year, he is certain to be ordered to serve added jail time.

The man who made millions of pounds by selling franchises for weight-loss products – which were found in scientific tests to be ineffective – first made headlines in Britain in the 1980s when he dated models and even took one on a six-month tour of Europe in a Rolls-Royce.

Foster has previously been jailed in the UK, the US and Australia because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry

In 2002 Cherie Blair, wife of of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair allegedly purchased two apartments with the help of the Australian conman

Later he began an affair with Cherie Blair’s fitness ‘guru’ Carole Caplin.

 It was through Miss Caplin that he agreed to help the-then Labour Prime Minister’s wife to purchase two flats in Bristol for a discounted price. It resulted in Mrs Blair sending him an email saying he was ‘a star’. 

When she learned of his notoriety, she tearfully admitted her mistake in public.

Foster has boasted to the Daily Mail that he has been in prison in Britain, the US and Australia but insisted he had never been convicted of fraud. Rather, he said, he had been found guilty of advertising misdemeanours.

During his time in Britain, he befriended Carole Caplin, Cherie Blair’s fitness 'guru' which is how he came to get close to the Blair family

He was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US.

Convictions in the past did not stop him continuing to be involved in the weight loss industry in Australia and he found himself behind bars again, this time in Queensland.

On being freed, he became a silent partner in another weight loss scam and was due to be sentenced last year when he disappeared - only to post photos of himself enjoying kava in Fiji. Or so it seemed.

But reports began to emerge that he had been seen in northern New South Wales - and now it appears that those reports had foundation, with his arrest near Byron Bay.

Foster was jailed for false advertising in the UK and later faced similar punishment in the US 

Having heard Foster boast of his ability to date beautiful women, his former lawyer Sean Cousins has described him as a ‘narcissistic psychopath’. When he heard that Foster had been arrested, Mr Cousins, who has claimed that the conman has threatened him over the phone, said last night that he was relieved.

He told the Gold Coast Bulletin that he had always believed Foster was living near Byron Bay and not in Fiji as the conman had claimed with a series of internet photos allegedly showing him in the Pacific nation.

‘I think it is sad that it has taken police so long to find him,’ said Mr Cousins. ‘I understood that he had a friend rent a couple of houses for him and he has been hopping between the two for months.’

The Daily Mail revealed in 2002 that Cherie Blair had used Australian conman Peter Foster to obtain a discount on two luxury flats in Bristol for her.

There were strong denials from the Blairs that they even knew Foster, but the lie was laid bare when on December 5 the Mail published a series of emails between Foster and Mrs Blair discussing the purchase of the flats.

Foster, who was involved in an affair with Mrs Blair’s fitness ‘guru’ Carole Caplin at the time, told the Prime Minister’s wife he had managed to get a £69,000 discount, adding: ‘Let me know if I can be of service ... as I tell Carole, your pleasure is my purpose.’

He went on to tell Mrs Blair that the mortgage could be handled by his accountant who ‘will not charge you for his services as I will pay him through my company’.

Mrs Blair replied that ‘you are a star’ and later, after meeting him at Miss Caplin’s gym, wrote to him on November 9 telling him that she could not thank him enough for taking the negotiations over for her and hoped they could ‘see each other again soon’.

Downing Street initially stated that Foster was not, and had not been, a financial adviser to the Blair family. But after the Mail exposed the emails, Mrs Blair tearfully apologised for denying Foster’s involvement.

No 10 said that if Mrs Blair had known of his past she would have been more circumspect.

But Foster’s background had been well documented before Cheriegate. In 1994 he was fined £21,000 for a trading standards offence relating to his Bai Lin weight loss tea, and two years later he was jailed for breaching laws regarding distribution of slimming granules.

He escaped from prison and went to Australia, where he was extradited to Britain. Later he was jailed in the US for another trading standards offence – and when he returned to Britain in 2000 he was jailed again, briefly, for using fraudulent documents to obtain credit for a slimming cream company.
