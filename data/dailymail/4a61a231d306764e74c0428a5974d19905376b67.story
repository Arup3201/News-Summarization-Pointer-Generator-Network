Twice Tottenham took the lead and twice they let it slip and it is the squandering of what should have been all three points that will occupy their manager Mauricio Pochettino in the coming days.

He admitted as much himself afterwards, repeating that he had to ‘analyse’ what happened.

He summed it up perfectly, though, when he said: ‘We managed the game. We controlled it, but we did not kill it.’

His energetic, inventive side bounded into a second-minute lead through Nacer Chadli, then allowed Sunderland to level just 74 seconds later.

Early in the second half, Spurs again took a lead their dominance warranted, Christian Eriksen converting from close range. But another error, this time an own goal by substitute Harry Kane, gifted the hosts a point.

Sunderland might have snatched all three in the final minute after a powerful run by Patrick van Aanholt set up Will Buckley in front of goal. But the 24-year-old smacked his effort over the bar, allowing Tottenham to head back south with a point — the least they deserved — and Sunderland still winless.

Pochettino said: ‘I’m disappointed, my players too, because we played well, made chances. In other games you’ll have the chances that we had and win.

‘I’m not worried because the most important thing is to create the chances,’ he said. But frankly he looked a little bewildered.

‘We need to be more solid,’ he said. Then: ‘I need to analyse the first goal.’ Then: ‘We need to be more smart.’ As for Kane’s own goal, he said: ‘Unlucky. But that is football.’

The reaction of Gus Poyet said everything. Asked if he was happy with a point, he beamed and said: ‘I’m happy with that. It was our hardest game so far, against the best team we’ve played so far. It was a really, really hard day for us and that was a proper point.’

Sunderland’s three points from three draws against West Brom, Manchester United and Tottenham, plus a defeat at QPR, leave them 13th. Poyet says the elusive first win is best not even discussed with his players. ‘The more we talk about the win we cannot get, the more it becomes difficult,’ he said.

He dropped Steven Fletcher — who did not even make the bench — and handed a debut to one of his deadline-day signings, Ricardo Alvarez. The 26-year-old Argentinian is on a one-year loan from Inter Milan and played a substitute’s role for his country last week as they drubbed Germany 4-2 in a friendly.

Alvarez began on the right of a four-man midfield and looked taken aback by the pace. Poyet switched him to the left, swapping with Adam Johnson, and he got more involved — but quickly looked tired. He was also clattered several times and went off in the second half. ‘A proper Premier League welcome,’ said Poyet with a wry smile.

Tottenham could have led in the first minute, with Eriksen setting Danny Rose free down the left for a shot that required a decent stop from Vito Mannone. But they scored when Emmanuel Adebayor’s shot was parried by Mannone and Chadli was quickest to the rebound.

At the other end Johnson cut in from the left, took on a defender and his shot went in off Kaboul. Adebayor and Chadli combined to set up Eriksen for Spurs’ second, assisted by a defensive mistake involving Van Aanholt and Wes Brown. Sunderland were saved when Jordi Gomez’s free-kick hit Kane and bounced in.
