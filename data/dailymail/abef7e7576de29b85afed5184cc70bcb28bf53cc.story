Got a beauty problem? Try sticking a patch on it. 

Women are increasingly resorting to cloth, plaster and jelly ‘patches’ which, when stuck to the face, and sometimes left overnight, are said to treat everything from lip wrinkles to frown lines. 

But apart from giving your husband nightmares, do they work? Claire Coleman teamed up with skincare expert Jonquille Chantrey, who runs an aesthetic clinic in Cheshire, to test them.

BUDGET EYEBAG BUSTER 

Montagne Jeunesse Anti-Wrinkle Cool Eyes, £1.99 for two pairs, montagnejeunesse.com

The claim: These clever little eye patches help reduce fine lines, sagging skin and crow’s feet. Chill in the fridge before use.

Claire says: They felt like blobs of jelly, or those ‘chicken fillets’ women use in their bras. Cooling and moisturising, so any lines due to dryness disappeared — but the effect wore off before the day was out.

Expert view: Sagging skin and crow’s feet are caused by sun damage, fat loss and repeated muscle contraction. Any topical product will have to be able to deliver active ingredients through the skin barrier. But the cold mask helps to reduce swelling by temporarily shrinking the blood vessels under the eye.

Verdict: Won’t get rid of all lines or bags, but will provide a temporary boost to eyes for an evening out. A total bargain. 3/5

ESSENCE OF SNAIL

Skin Pep Hydro-Gel Decolletage, £14.99 for five, skinpep.com

The Claim: One application will dramatically hydrate, smooth, soften and boost skin elasticity. The mask contains five clinically tested peptides, botanical extracts, antioxidants . . . and concentrated snail secretion to rejuvenate fatigued looking skin.

Claire says: Like all the other masks that trap moisture against the skin, this helped banish crepiness on the neck, although couldn’t smooth out deeper lines.

Expert view: The neck is so often neglected. It needs special attention to prevent early signs of ageing, such as sagging and jowls. Snail secretion sounds like an odd ingredient, but there is some evidence that it contains a type of protein which may help with skin rejuvenation.

Verdict: If your neck needs a bit of tender loving care, this mask will definitely give it a quick boost. 3/5

FAREWELL TO FROWNS 

Frownies Forehead & Between the Eyes, £18.95 for 144 patches, frownies.co.uk

They say: Frownies Facial Patches help change the shape of the muscle under the patch. By holding the muscle flat and relaxed while you sleep the body can reverse muscle memory, keeping you from frowning while you sleep.

Claire says: These are like super-sticky stamps. You wet them, hold the skin taut, then stick them on. They sound basic but, after a couple of weeks, lines looked fainter.

Expert view: Some studies have shown that you may frown 70-80 times in your sleep, which eventually contributes to permanent lines. If these patches stay in place, they may be of benefit. I like the concept!

Verdict: Won’t get rid of wrinkles entirely as you’ll still frown during the day, but they’re inexpensive and quite effective. 5/5

LUXURY EYE SMOOTHERS 

Elemis Pro-Collagen Hydra-Gel Eye Masks, £46 for six pairs, timetospa.co.uk

The claim: Clinically proven to instantly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.

Claire says: Bigger than many cheaper ones, so worked on more of the face. Left on for 20 minutes, skin was smoother and tighter. Results seemed to last quite well.

Expert view: Some interesting ingredients. The houttuynia cordata leaf is used in Chinese medicine as a detoxifying element, whereas the camellia sinensis leaf (found in green tea) has anti-inflammatory properties. Hyaluronic acid will smooth the dead outer layer of skin cells, making skin feel hydrated in the short term.

Verdict: At this price, an occasional treat, but they did what they promised, hydrating, tightening and zinging up the eye area. 3/5

GOLDEN LIPS

Jamela Luxurious Gold Crystal Collagen Lip Mask, £46.75 for 16, jamelaskincare.co.uk

The claim:The combination of gold and plant collagen helps to increase cellular metabolism. The rapid absorption of the nutrients also replenishes moisture leaving the lips smoother and healthier.

Claire says: This makes you look quite strange, and only really stayed on when lying flat on your back, which was a bit annoying. Although lips were softer, they didn’t look plumper.

Expert view: The skin on the lips is thinner than the rest of the face and therefore more prone to moisture loss. Also contains rose oil, recognised as an emollient to dry skin, and short-term benefits may be seen due to the application of hyaluronic acid on the skin surface.

Verdict: This definitely softens lips, but the gold seems a bit of a gimmick. I don’t believe the mask will have an effect on the cellular metabolism, and at this price, you could buy a lot of hydrating, plumping lip balm. 1/5

IRON OUT SMILE LINES

Skyn Iceland Hydro Cool Firming Face Gels, £30 for eight (four for forehead, four pairs for smile lines), marksandspencer.com

The Claim: Visibly smooth smile lines — in ten minutes flat — without a needle in sight. These peptide-packed transdermal patches plump deep creases around the mouth.

Claire says: Although they definitely helped improve the surface of the skin, the deeper lines did not disappear in ten minutes.

Expert view: Hydrating oils can instantly smooth skin by softening the layer of dead cells on its surface, however long-term hydration usually needs specifically formulated hyaluronic acids to penetrate deeply. The gels contain Arctic cloudberry, which has high levels of vitamins A, C, E and B, important for healthy skin.

Verdict: Naso-labial folds — or marionette lines — are hard to treat without filler. These patches improve the appearance of the skin, but to see serious results you would need to apply ingredients such as these daily. 2/5

WIPE AWAY THE YEARS 

Line Smoothing Complex High Potency Treatment Mask, £46 for six, drlewinns.co.uk

The claim: A powerful anti-ageing booster to target the early signs of ageing and tired, lack-lustre complexions. Packed with natural extracts and advanced skin-smoothing and line-erasing technology to hydrate, plump and soothe skin.

Claire says: Being in two pieces makes this mask easy to use with no mess. Results were good: skin felt hydrated and looked glowing.

Expert view: Repeated facial expressions eventually cause permanent wrinkles. The key ingredient appears to be acetyl hexapeptide-8, which claims to soften some expression lines. An alternative to Botox? Not quite yet.

Verdict: This will get rid of fine lines, and as it’s soothing and fuss-free would be ideal for rejuvenating skin the morning after a party. About the same price as many luxury face masks, without the mess. 4/5
