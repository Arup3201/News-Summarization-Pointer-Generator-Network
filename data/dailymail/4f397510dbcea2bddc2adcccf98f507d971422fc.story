'Heeere's Johnny!'

Nope. It's actually David and Rebecca Wilson.

The Wilsons have been living together at the Many Glacier Hotel in Montana since October and taking care of the property during its off-season.

Although they don't have a son named Danny, the Wilsons are aware some are comparing their situation to that of Jack and Wendy Torrance in Stephen King and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. 

David and Rebecca Wilson have been living happily at the Many Glacier Hotel in Montana since October 

David is a caretaker at the hotel and they will be there maintaining it all winter until the spring thaw in April

Given how isolated the hotel is (pictured left) and how cut off the Wilsons are from the rest of the world, many have compared their situation to the one in the film The Shining (pictured right)

Many Glacier, which is located on the eastern edge of Glacier National Park, welcomes hundreds of thousands of guests each summer before it closes down for the year in September. 

Now the vacation hotspot has only two visitors: Rebecca and David.

An employee of the hotel since 2008, David does maintenance work on the 76-acre, 100-year-old property. 

This is the first winter he or Rebecca have stayed at the hotel to watch over it until things thaw out in the spring.

They will be battling snow, rain, wind, and occasional four-legged houseguests until April.

The Wilsons have seen fewer than ten people during their stay at Many Glacier and so isolated the only emergency vehicle that would be able to reach them is a snowplow, Yahoo Travel reported. 

In order to keep their friends, loved ones and past guests in the loop about what has been happening at the Swiss-alpine style hotel, David and Rebecca post updates on their A Winter At Many Glacier blog. 

They use the blog to post pictures, weather updates and information about the 'day to day life of the caretaker at the very remote Many Glacier Hotel in Glacier National Park'.

Fewer than ten people have seen the Wilsons, but they provide updates via the Winter At Many Glacier blog

This is the first winter David (pictured right) has stayed at the hotel to maintain it during the cold and snow

So far the 'all work and no play' lifestyle at the hotel hasn't caused either one of them to have a homicidal episode similar to Jack Nicholson's in The Shining. 

Fortunately for the Wilsons and the hotel's insurer, things sound peacefully dull at Many Glacier.

The Wilsons have not had a 'Heeere's Johnny' moment at the hotel and hopefully they won't

David said: 'We watched The Shining up here just because of that and there are a lot of parallels.

'Our hotel isn't heated and we don't live inside of it. But as far as the long hallways, that's similar. 

'There's also stocking up for food in the winter, which we have to do ourselves. 

'And then of course the snow.' 

Even though there isn't a gigantic hedge maze on the property, there is a direct connection between Many Glacier and the fictional Overlook Hotel featured in the film. 

Kubrick filmed a scene for the movie, which is set in Colorado, on Glacier Park's Going-to-the-Sun Road, the Flathead Beacon reported. 

However, the Many Glacier only has 214 rooms, so the creepy Room 237 that Danny is warned to stay out of because it has a 'shine' in the film does not exist. 

Despite the isolation, the Wilsons don't sound as if they are looking forward to the spring. 

David said: 'Actually, the winter is going by too fast. 

'We wish we had another six months of this.

'We love the valley anyway and I could live here year round.

'But the winter is a nice opportunity to catch up on maintenance so in the spring it's not such a push. 

'It's like a tradition being passed along.

'When you're up here, you kind of take ownership of the place.'

The property of Many Glacier does not contain a hedge maze, but it does border lakes and mountains 

Many Glacier does have a bar (left) but it doesn't come stocked with a ghostly bartender... or Jack (right)

The Shining (pictured) was written by Stephen King and filmmaker Stanley Kubrick directed the movie

In their latest post, the Wilsons wrote: 'For the last four days it has been raining and we've seen a lot of our snow melt away. 

'This is the second warm spell we've had this winter. 

'It's amazing how much snow has disappeared, don't get me wrong we still have a lot of huge drifts around, but there have been more bare spots showing up lately.

'From what we've been told this kind of weather is normal even in the middle of winter and that the big snow months are still ahead.'
