Cheeky: Yonni Barrios now lives with his mistress, but sleeps at wife's home if they argue

The 'cheeky' Chilean miner who faced the wrath of his wife by asking both her and his mistress to greet him on reaching the surface has revealed he is dying.

Yonni Barrios said he has developed lung disease silicosis - from dust in his lungs - a year to the day since he was one of 33 trapped miners winched to safety after 69 days underground.

But astonishingly the 51-year-old has revealed he is still seeing both women - and now lives with mistress Susana Valenzuela but stays at his wife Marta Salinas' nearby home whenever they argue.

He said: 'It's a complicated situation.'

Speaking about his illness, he told the Sun: 'I am very sick. My lungs have become clogged and it is difficult for me to breathe.

'The doctors say I have silicosis and there's little they can do to help me. I've become very depressed. My lungs are permanently damaged and I have to accept this disease could kill me.'

Millions across the world were glued to their television sets on October 13, 2010, as the 33 trapped men were rescued one by one from the San Jose copper mine through an escape capsule.

Mr Barrios, who lives in the poverty-stricken district of Copiapo city, was dubbed the 'doctor' because he treated his colleagues medically.

He used knowledge gained from looking after his diabetic mother to work with medical teams on the surface to diagnose and help the men trapped with him.

But very soon he became even better known for something rather less noble. His wife and another woman were both holding a vigil for him in Camp Hope.

Marta Salinas, 59, whom he married 29 years ago, reportedly almost came to blows with Susana Valenzuela, 51, when they faced off in the mine’s dining area. The pair had to be pulled apart.

As his wife began to get involved in his affairs on Camp Hope, he instructed teams on the surface to deal with his lover instead.

And as the day of the rescue finally approached, he asked for both of them to wait for him as he emerged from the borehole. In the end he was greeted by his mistress, his wife choosing to stay away.

He looked calm as he gingerly walked towards her, who gave him a long hug, crying on his shoulder and occasionally pulling back to look at him as if to make sure the reunion was really happening.

After he emerged, his wife, who has three sons from an earlier relationship, said she was over Barrios and did not feel 'anything in particular'.

A year on from the rescue and he has moved in with Susana. But he still has a room at his wife's house nearby, to where he runs after rows with his mistress.

Mr Barrios, who sees a psychologist three times a week,  said he also suffers flashbacks about the days following the mine collapse in northern Chile.

He added: 'Ever since I left the mine, I have been messed up. I cannot sleep at night. I stay up until five in the morning, my mind racing.

'When I finally do get to sleep, I have nightmares that I am back in the mine. My dream is always the same - I am trapped and trying to escape. I wake up screaming, in cold sweats.'
