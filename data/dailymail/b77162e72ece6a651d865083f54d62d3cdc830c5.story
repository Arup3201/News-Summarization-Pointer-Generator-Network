Someone at the White House clearly needs to go back to elementary school.

Press credentials given to members of the media travelling with President Obama across the West Coast this week had a glaring mistake.

A map incorrectly identified Wyoming as Colorado in an embarrassing error that will leave someone at the White House with a very red face.

Wrong: A map incorrectly identified Wyoming as Colorado in an embarrassing error that will leave someone at the White House with a very red face

President Obama was travelling to Washington, California and Colorado over a three-day period to help his bid for re-election next year.

The mistake was probably made because the two states are next to each other and are both a similar size and shape, reported CNN.

Colorado is seen as an important state for President Obama's re-election chances, reported Yahoo News.

He spoke in Denver, Colorado, on Tuesday about his proposed jobs bill in an attempt to garner public support and media coverage in the state.

Correct version: This is how the map should have been highlighted to show President Obama was travelling to Washington, California and Colorado

The three states he was visiting were 
highlighted in white under the words: ‘The trip of President Barack 
Obama to the American West’.

Colorado Republican Party chairman Ryan Call seized upon the White House’s mistake in an interview with Fox News.

'If the White House can't even find 
Colorado on the map, how in the world does Barack Obama expect to 
address the issues of the economy (and) unemployment that are facing 
Colorado voters?'

He said: ‘If the White House can't even find Colorado on the map, how in the world does Barack Obama expect to address the issues of the economy (and) unemployment that are facing Colorado voters?’

But the mistake did not concern Wyoming Democratic party executive director Bill Luckett or Colorado Democratic strategist Laura Chapin.

‘I know they might get their square states confused, but there are more people than cows here,’ Ms Chapin told Fox News.

President Obama beat Senator John McCain by nine points in Colorado in 2008 - but lost by 32 points in Wyoming, reported Fox News.
