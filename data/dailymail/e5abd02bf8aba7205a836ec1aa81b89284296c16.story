Crystal Palace stepped up their preparations for the Premier League season by beating MLS outfit Philadelphia Union thanks to an own goal from Ethan White.

The Eagles picked up their first win of their American tour by defeating a side who have lost just once in their last 11 games.

Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis made just one change from the side which drew 2-2 with Columbus Crew on Wednesday - with Chamakh replacing fellow striker Glenn Murray.

Solid display: The Eagles' defence, led by Damien Delaney, kept a clean sheet against Philadelphia Union

Safe hands: Julian Speroni and his defenders kept Philadelphia Union at bay

Philadelphia Union starting XI: Blake, Fabinho, Berry, White, Gaddis, Edu, Nogueira, Fred, Cruz, Wenger, Brown.

Crystal Palace: Speroni, Ward (Mariappa 50), Dann (McCarthy 54, Ramage 65), Delaney, Jerome Williams (Boateng 65), Puncheon (Bannan 54), Jedinak (O'Keefe 50), Ledley (Gray 65), Bolasie (Thomas 54), Chamakh (Guedioura 65), Gayle (Murray 50).

Sub not used: Price.

Goals: White 20 og

And it was Chamakh who played a major role in Crystal Palace's opener in the 20th minute as the former Arsenal striker forced Philadelphia Union defender White into nodding the ball into his own net.

Pulis' side came close to doubling their advantage through Yannick Bolasie and Dwight Gayle however both players were denied by saves from the home side's outsanding Jamaican goalkeeper Andre Blake.

The Welshman rung the changes in the second half with the likes of Jerome Thomas, Barry Bannan and Paddy McCarthy being handed the chance to impress.

Palace, who announced the signing of Fraizer Campbell from Cardiff shortly before their latest pre-season friendly, will complete the final leg of their USA tour on Monday when they take on the Richmond Kickers.

The south London side will then travel back to Europe to face Brentford and FC Augsburg before facing Arsenal in the Premier League.

Delighted: Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis will be happy with his side's performance
