Alex Salmond yesterday admitted that the nationalists are now the ‘underdogs’ in next month’s Scottish referendum – after he suffered a comprehensive defeat at the hands of Alistair Darling in the first TV debate.

Mr Salmond’s independence campaign, which is 16 points behind in the polls, suffered a massive setback when the First Minister faltered as he was asked to explain how his dream would work in practice.

Mr Salmond was booed and heckled by the audience after he refused to answer a question five times – failing to say what his ‘plan B’ would be if Westminster refused to let an independent Scotland use the pound in a currency union.

Handshake: Alex Salmond with Alistair Darling before Tuesday's televised debate

A recent opinion poll, which was released to coincide with the two-hour debate on Tuesday night, showed that out of those who have made up their mind, 58 per cent plan to vote No compared to 42 per cent who will choose Yes.

And a snap poll carried out by ICM for The Guardian immediately after the clash indicated that Mr Darling had scored a victory over the SNP leader, winning the debate by 56 per cent to 44 per cent.

Mr Salmond now faces an uphill battle to reverse the polls, and appears to be on the back foot.

Yesterday he arrived more than an hour late at a conference for businessmen who support separation, amid rumours that he had been busy holding crisis meetings.

However he insisted that he was still in with a chance of winning the referendum on September 18. Mr Salmond said: ‘There is six weeks of this campaign. I think everybody knows now that we are in a real position of possible victory.’ 

He went on to admit that the nationalists are ‘now the underdogs’, but added: ‘I relish that position.’

The first television showdown between the two figureheads of the Yes and No campaigns saw several heated exchanges take place. 

Mr Salmond accused his rival of resorting to being a ‘shouty man’ in the often ill-tempered debate, which attracted 1.7million viewers.

He said: ‘I am absolutely certain that the way to not just win this campaign, but to win the hearts and minds of the people, is to have a discussion. Not to shout at them, not to point your finger at them, not to wave your hands about, but to actually have a conversation about what matters to people and their families.’

The First Minister yesterday claimed that snap polls which were conducted over the course of the televised debate had shown an increase in support for independence from some of the viewers.

He said: ‘The Yes support, people watching the debate, started at 45 per cent which is high and went up to 47 per cent, which is in touching distance of victory.

‘Particularly significant is the surge in support from women, and the fact that I think 74 per cent of undecided voters thought the Yes side won the debate. These are great findings for us, they show we are pursuing the right strategy.’

However Mr Darling pointed out that the First Minister has failed to come up with the answers needed on issues such as the pound.

The Better Together leader said: ‘I think it was a good debate, but the important thing is Scotland wants to know the answer on what currency we will use. You can’t rely on guesswork, fingers crossed, we need to know what his plan B is and he won’t tell us.’

He went on to say: ‘In a debate you’re supposed to come up with answers. Now he had the odd good line, but he had no answer.’ 

It was the debate Alex Salmond hoped would revive his campaign for independence.

But the Scottish Press yesterday declared the First Minister had suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of ex-chancellor Alistair Darling.

The Daily Record proclaimed: ‘Alex takes a pounding’ and ‘Salmond is slugged’, as it claimed he was ‘left with a bloody nose’.

The Glasgow Herald yesterday: The paper said Mr Darling had 'upset the odds after coming out on top'

‘Few gave him a chance, but it’s underdog Darling’s night as he tears into his rival over the future of the pound,’ said the paper as it referred to Mr Salmond’s repeated refusal to state what Scotland would do if Westminster refused a currency union.

‘Darling draws first blood’, ran the front-page headline of the Herald. The Glasgow-based newspaper said Mr Darling had ‘upset the odds after coming out on top’.

Political editor Magnus Gardham wrote: ‘For the Yes campaign, trailing in the polls, the debate was a huge opportunity to press their case. Mr Salmond and his colleagues might feel privately that the encounter was a missed opportunity to march into the crucial final phase of the campaign on the front foot.’ The Scottish Daily Mail ran the headline ‘A bloody nose for Salmond’ on its front page.

‘Alex Salmond was licking his wounds last night following a live TV showdown with Alistair Darling which dealt a crippling blow to his bid to break up Britain,’ it said. ‘The First Minister, a skilled debater, had been expected to comfortably see off his rival but was left badly bruised after the angry clash.’

The Dundee Courier described the debate as a ‘bruising battle’, adding that ‘Mr Darling will definitely be more satisfied’ with his performance.

Commentator Alan Cochrane wrote in the Scottish Daily Telegraph: ‘The incredible vacuum at the heart of Alex Salmond’s economic policy was laid bare in the most humiliating fashion … a hammering pure and simple.’

The Scottish Sun was more sympathetic to the First Minister, saying in its leader column: ‘The first battle has ended in a draw – the contest is far from over.’

 

Fury over TV blackout in England 

Viewers criticised broadcasters after the debate on whether Scotland should break up its 300-year-old union with the rest of the United Kingdom was only shown north of the border.

Figures yesterday revealed that 1.2million people in Scotland watched the show on television, but people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were only able to access an unreliable online feed.

Although both the BBC and Sky News asked to televise the debate, broadcaster STV, which organised the event, refused.

Instead they offered ITV the opportunity to show the programme outside Scotland, but the channel chose to show Alan Titchmarsh’s Love Your Garden and Kids Behind Bars, a documentary about American young offenders.

Around 500,000 people watched the debate online. The surge in demand crashed the STV website, leaving viewers in the rest of the UK unable to see the first part of the showdown. Yesterday STV apologised for their website’s breakdown, saying the failure had been caused by ‘unprecedented demand’.

STV spokesman Bobby Hain said: ‘This landmark television debate delivered ratings that make it the best-watched political debate in Scotland for more than ten years. The online stream achieved over half a million viewers.’

But he added: ‘We are aware that due to extremely high demand some viewers had difficulties accessing the programme.

‘We apologise to anyone who was not able to watch the debate in full. The programme is available on our catch-up service, STV Player.’ A number of viewers expressed their frustration at not being able to watch the debate outside Scotland on Twitter.

Labour MP Tom Watson wrote: ‘It may not be of interest to many, but you would have thought a debate on the future of the Union would be broadcast UK wide.’

And broadcaster Andrew Neil wrote: ‘Trying to watch Salmond v Darling on STV iPlayer. But feed from STV making a great debate impossible to watch. Really angry. Useless beyond words.’

An ITV spokesman said: ‘ITV screened the debate live in the area where our viewers have a vote in the question under discussion, Border Scotland.

‘The debate was of course covered as a news story in our news programmes broadcast to the whole of the UK.’

The Yes and No campaigns are now in negotiations with the BBC about staging a second live debate later this month.
