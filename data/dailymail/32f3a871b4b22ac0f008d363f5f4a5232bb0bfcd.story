When most people see a shark lurking just a few feet below them, they swim for the hills.

Erica Henderson is not most people.

Ms. Henderson was surfing at El Porto Beach in southern California last week when she spotted the dorsal fin of a shark just feet away.

Scary: Erica Henderson spotted this shark just feet away from her as she surfed in southern California last week

Brave: Rather than swim away from the deadly shark, Henderson flipped her camera around and started recording it

Rather than staging a mad dash towards the shore, Ms. Henderson grabbed her camera and began following the deadly fish.

'I reached for my camera, stuck it in the water and started paddling towards the shark in hopes to get it on film,' Ms. Henderson tells Yahoo!

Ms. Henderson captured footage of the animal just a few feet below her as she floated on her board. The shark appears unfazed and swims away as Ms. Henderson recorded its movements.

Rare: Other surfers have reported shark sightings, but most agree it is rare to find sharks at El Porto Beach

'I would guess that the shark was at least seven feet in size,' she says.

Other surfers in the area told KCAL9 that they've had similar shark sightings at El Porto Beach recently, although only Ms. Henderson was gutsy enough to follow the animal and capture it on video.

One surfer, however, says shark sightings are unusual at the beach.

'I havenâ€™t had any direct experiences with any sharks trying to attack me,' Oscar Cruz said.
