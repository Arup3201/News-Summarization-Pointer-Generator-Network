After her victory on Strictly Come Dancing at the end of last year, Abbey Clancy admitted she was worried the intense routines had made her figure too muscly and masculine but her latest shots for Ultimo tell a different story.

The model and TV presenter, who is 
married to footballer Peter Crouch, has taken over as the new face of 
the lingerie brand from Michael Bublé's wife Luisana Lopilato and showcases the latest offering to perfection.

Abbey, who is currently topping up her tan in Dubai, shows off her toned physique while modelling the Ultimo 'Low Back Strapless' bra.

Va-va voom! Abbey Clancy is proving her worth as Luisana Lopilato's replacement in her new Ultimo campaign

The lingerie, designed by Michelle Mone OBE, is described as the new 'party solution'.

Michelle Mone said: 'This is a godsend product for women who love back-baring fashion. There’s nothing sexier than showing off your back on a night out, and this new product allows you to work the trend without compromising on comfort, lift or support.

'Back-plunging dresses have become a must-have for the red carpet and I wanted to create the perfect Ultimo product to go with this growing trend. If you want to be party-perfect in your low-back gown, this is the bra for you.'

Celebrity fans of backless fashion 
include Rihanna, who recently wore a quirky backless jumper whilst out 
in London, and Emma Watson - who wowed on the red carpet at the NYC 
premier of Noah wearing a low-back Oscar de la Renta ballgown.

Latest creation: The new invention, designed by Michelle Mone OBE, prides itself as being the new 'party solution' and costs £35

Abbey
 is a huge fan of the natural look these days and she told Now magazine 
that her body is all her own and says that surgery rumours are untrue.

'I wish my boobs were big enough to get a boob reduction,' she told the publication.

'Bl**dy hell. I haven't had a boob job, I haven't had veneers, I haven't had Botox.'

In fact, the mum of three-year-old Sophia, believes that pregnancy caused her breasts to shrink.

She told Sunday Times Style: 'My body changed. I lost my bust.'
