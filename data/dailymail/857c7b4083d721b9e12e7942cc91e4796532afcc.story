Regrets? He might have had a few. But Jim McAllister, a Frank Sinatra tribute singer, was unabashed after smashing up an Indian restaurant and winding up in court.

The globe-trotting vocalist went on the rampage after believing he had been short-changed by the owners.

McAllister, 45, who has performed in Las Vegas, smashed a glass door and table lamp as he stormed out after singing at the Rajdoot Tandoori restaurant, near Droitwich, Worcestershire.

Old Blue Eyes: Jim McAllister wrecked an Indian restaurant after claiming that he had been underpaid for a gig

The singer admitted criminal damage 
when he appeared before Worcester Magistrates’ Court. But he then 
shrugged off the incident, saying: ‘That’s life.’

Prosecutor
 Lesley Ashton told magistrates that McAllister had been booked last 
June by restaurant owner Nina Tiara, who left an envelope containing 
£300 for him as payment. But the singer claimed that a £400 fee had been
 agreed following a previous date that was cancelled at the last minute.

‘Miss Tiara explained she would not be able to pay him the £400 and McAllister became agitated,’ said Miss Ashton.

The singer told the owner: ‘I’m getting done again by you’, before describing the manager of the restaurant as ‘a disgrace’.

‘McAllister
 then stormed out of the conservatory and lashed out by punching a large
 table lamp and then a fluted glass container used for storing water,’ 
said  Miss Ashton.

‘There was damage to  the door that was not there before he began to play  that night.’

Magistrates
 gave McAllister a 12-month conditional discharge, and he was ordered to
 pay £670 in compensation to Miss Tiara, £85 in court costs and a £15 
victim surcharge.

Sunil 
Jagatia, defending, said McAllister performed all over the world and 
previously had a good working relationship with Miss Tiara.

She
 was said to be a friend and the singer would perform at a reduced rate,
 but the relationship ‘started to break down’ after several occasions 
when Miss Tiara had cancelled gigs.

Mr
 Jagatia claimed that his client had been promised £400 and matters 
‘came to a head’ when McAllister discovered that only £300 had been 
left. ‘He became very angry and lashed out,’ Mr Jagatia said.

‘He accepts the working relationship has broken down and just wants a speedy resolution to this, indicated by his plea.’

After the case, McAllister, from Halesowen, West Midlands, laughed off the conviction.

‘I
 did lose it and unfortunately as I left the restaurant I slammed the 
door,’ he said. ‘The glass in it smashed, which is where the cost kicked
 in.

‘I was just pushed over the edge. I have done the job for 18 years and have hundreds of happy clients.

‘Mr Sinatra was never adverse to a bit of publicity himself – whether it was good or bad – and I guess that is the case here.

‘To use one of the great man’s songs, that’s life.’
