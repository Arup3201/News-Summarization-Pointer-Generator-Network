A Hertfordshire police spokesman told MailOnline: 'The 59-year-old was arrested at 1.25am on February 7 in Fore Street, Hertford. 

'She has been charged with drink driving and bailed to return to the North & East Hertfordshire Magistrates Court on February 23.'

He added: 'A 59-year-old man from Cambridgeshire who was a passenger was also arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and has been issued with a fixed penalty notice and released.'

The couple met through friends after the breakdown of the actress' 23-year relationship with ex-fiancé Geoff Knights in 2009 and have been together since 2012.   

The actress, best known for her role as Kathy Beale in EastEnders, started dating the former stockbroker just a few years after he served time for importing one of the biggest ecstasy hauls ever seized in the UK.

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2003, after being found guilty of plotting to import and supply Class A drugs at Bristol Crown Court, but served just seven years of his sentence.

At the time of the court case, it was the biggest drugs raid in history after police found 839,500 ecstasy tablets worth an estimated £7.5million.  

Last week she went public about Fairbairn's prostate cancer treatment. The revelation comes just 15 months after her ex-partner Knights died from the disease.
