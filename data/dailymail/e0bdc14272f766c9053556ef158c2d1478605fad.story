It takes a brave model to hold a pose when an enormous whale shark is swimming just inches from her head. 

But for Roberta Mancino, it's just another day in the office.

The model, who is also a professional skydiver and wing-suit flyer, spent 20 days swimming in waters near the northern Peninsula of Mexico in search of giant sea creatures - including the sailfish, the world's fastest fish.

The model was particularly excited about swimming with the sailfish - the world's fastest fish can reach speeds of up to 68mph

The sailfish can grow up to nine feet long and has an elongated bill, resembling that of a swordfish

Ms Mancino, 33, from Anzio, Italy, swam with whale sharks, manta rays and sailfish during two ten-day diving expeditions in February 2013 and February 2014.

The trips took her near Isla Mujeres - a Mexican island famous for its abundance of large sea creatures.

She had to spend hours in the water, holding her breath for up to a minute at a time, while being filmed by Emmy Award-winning cinematographer and photographer Shawn Heinrichs.

The shoot was part of a broader series depicting marine life interactions that inspire ocean conservation.

Speaking about the experience, Roberta said: 'It has always been one of my dreams to swim with the fastest fish in the ocean and to see how they hunt it's really exciting - eventually I would love to swim with all the coolest underwater creatures.

 'It's hard to be prepared, even if you swim a lot before and do free-diving exercise, it doesn't help much when you are in the water - they are very fast.

'Under the water it was full of action and excitement the entire time, it is very challenging to find them and to reach them in time to get a photograph.'

Ms Mancino has completed more than 7,000 skydives, four of them naked, and was named the World's Sexiest Female Athlete by Men's Fitness magazine in 2010.
