Actor Bernard Kay who starred in Coronation Street, Doctor Who, Doctor Zhivago and Z-Cars, has died aged 86.

The television star, who also appeared in a host of other TV shows including Jonathan Creek, Emmerdale Farm, Casualty and The Professionals, was found dead at his north London home on Monday.

His friend, actor Toby Hadoke, confirmed his death on Twitter today and said the cause had yet to be determined.

Kay, who was cast in various roles in Doctor Who during the 1960s, scooped an award in 2006 for the first chapter of his memoirs, Maybe A Bastard, in which he described his difficult childhood in pre-war Bolton.

He won the Creative Non-Fiction title at the New Writing Ventures awards for unpublished writers.

It was his first piece of writing since he was a newspaper reporter more than half a century earlier at the Bolton Evening News and the Manchester Guardian.

Paying tribute to his friend, Mr Hadoke said: 'He was one of those superb understated but versatile actors that we don't seem to have any more.

'He never gave a bad performance.

'He was greatly admired by his peers.

'His sense of humour was combative but there wasn't any meanness in him.'

Mr Hadoke announced Kay's death on Twitter earlier today, writing: 'It is worth great regret that I announce the sad death of the actor Bernard Kay who passed away over Christmas aged 86. RIP Bernard.'

He later added: 'Admin done, so now can I just say that Bernard Kay was one of TV's finest ever character actors: always nuanced, understated & intelligent. (sic).'

British horror novelist Mark Morris also paid tribute on Twitter, writing: “So sad to hear of the brilliant Bernard Kay’s death. Wouldn’t it be great if his lost Who episodes were found in 2015?”

Kay, who grew up in Bolton, attended Manchester's Chetham's School before completing National Service and later attending the Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol.

He was the lead star in one of the early Doctor Who adventures, The Dalek Invasion Of Earth, in 1964 and returned to the series the following year as Saladin in The Crusade. He later appeared in The Faceless Ones in 1967 and Colony In Space in 1971.

His most famous film appearance was as a Bolshevik leader in Doctor Zhivago in 1965. He commuted between Madrid, Spain, and London to play the role.

Other notable movie roles included Sinbad and the Eye of The Tiger in 1977 and contemporary horror Psychosis in 2010.

He was married to Patricia Haines, the first wife of Michael Caine, from 1963 until her death in 1977.

In 1998, he was nominated for a RITA (Real Irish Theatre Award) for his portrayal of Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.
