In his latest jab at the Palin family, Levi Johnston has announced he will take on Todd Palin in next year's Iron Dog snowmobile race.

Johnston, who had a child with former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol in 2008, told TMZ that it's been his lifelong dream to enter the three-day, 2000-mile race through the Alaskan wilderness.

But his main goal in entering 'the world's logesnt, roughest snowmobile race' is taking down Todd Palin, Sarah's husband and his son Tripp's grandfather.

While Todd has won the race four times in the past, Johnston may have an advantage since Todd hasn't won since 2007 and had to pull out of this year's race after just 100 miles due to mechanical problems.

And Johnston has all year to prepare since the next race is 348 days away. 

Johnston became semi-famous during the 2008 presidential election when it was revealed that Bristol was pregnant with his child.

Bristol's pregnancy caused controversy since the two were unmarried and still in high school, but that was semi-quelled when Sarah announced the two were getting hitched.

Some said Sarah forced the marriage on her daughter, a claim Johnston has consistently denied.

'We were planning on getting married a long time ago with or without the kid. This was the plan from the start,' Johnston said.

Bristol and Johnston's son Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston was born in December 2008, but the two broke off their engagement the following March.

After their break-up, Johnston became outspoken against the Palin family, saying in a September 2009 Vanity Fair article that Sarah initially wanted to keep Bristol's pregnancy a secret.

Johnston said Sarah offered to adopt and raise their child as her own, but that they declined.

In response, Sarah issued a statement saying Johnston's statements were 'untrue, malicious, and appalling'.

The young couple briefly reunited in July 2010, with Johnston issuing a public apology to the Palin family for statements he made that 'were not completely' true.

But the couple broke off their second engagement just three weeks later, and Johnston said he regretted making the public apology to the Palin family.

He said the statement 'kind of makes me sound like a liar. I've never lied about anything'.

Johnston is currently married to Sunny Oglesby and the two have a one-year-old daughter named Breeze.

He published a tell-all memoir of his life with the Palins in September 2011 titled 'Deer in the Headlights: My Life in Sarah Palin's Crosshairs'.
