Donald Trump insists that he hasn't made any commitments to headline a new season of 'Celebrity Apprentice' for NBC, saying 'all options are on the table' for his future – leaving open the possibility that he might make an earnest run for president in 2016.

'I am greatly honored for the renewal by NBC of "Apprentice" for a 15th season,' the on-again, off-again political hopeful told Daily Mail Online. 'But, as I said on live television, I will be taking my time meaning all options are on the table.'

Trump's spokespeople were quick to issue clarifications after Monday night's season finale when he announced what amounts to NBC asking for a contract extension.

'But Mr. Trump is taking his time and he has no commitment to have it on,' his spokesman Sam Nunberg said Wednesday. 'It's on at his discretion.'  

'He has the option but he is exploring other options. This is nothing like 2011 – that I can guarantee you. ... A lot of serious announcements are going to be made in the coming weeks.'

Four years ago Trump dangled the possibility of a challenge to President Barack Obama, saying he would run an unconventional campaign with his own money. But that effort failed to push aside his real estate deals and TV appearances.

'The last time I did have a problem. ... I had a signed contract,' he said Tuesday night on the Fox News Channel.

This time around, Trump stressed, he isn't playing around.

Asked for a 1-to-10 number indicating his enthusiasm for running, he told host Sean Hannity that it's 'much more than 5 on the scale.' 

Trump that NBC executives 'want to renew me as long as I live, I guess.'

But again he insisted that his mind isn't made up.  

A spokesperson for the Trump Organization, the tycoon's principal holding company, explained that while the NBC show has had ratings successes, he's on the fence about keeping it going. And politics is just one option, including more real estate deals and other entertainment ventures.

Nunberg rattled off a list of political appearances that Trump will make in the coming months, starting with a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on February 27 near Washington, D.C. 

On February 22 he will speak at a Citadel Republican Society event in Charleston, South Carolina, appearing at a 'Patriot Dinner' with Republican SenatorTim Scott.

He's making enough appearances in early primary states to convince some observers that he's serious about trading in his Manhattan address for a bedroom at The White House.

'There's no way to know what a guy like that is thinking,' said an Iowa Republican political consultant who hasn't yet committed to working for a specific candidate. 

'But if he's burning jet fuel to speak in New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina, at this point you have to consider him at least as serious as some of the other people who we assume are actually running.'

On March 7 Trump will speak at the Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines at an event where most of the top-tier GOP hopefuls will give remarks.

Later in the month he will be the inaugural guest in a series of speaker events hosted by former New Hampshire House Speaker Bill O'Brien.

The New Hampshire Journal describes the series as a chance for potential presidential candidates to recruit support from among conservative activists in the state. Some participants are expected to pay for the privilege, with reported figures reaching $50,000.

Nunbeg also said Trump has commitments to appear in Iowa in mid-May, and will help Republican politicians with fundraising events in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

NOT FIRED: Trump says he's not out of political contention even though NBC says it wants him back on the air this fall

Trump said the Obama administration's foreign policy experts 'don't know what they're doing,' especially in Iran

'Celebrity Apprentice' runner-up Geraldo Rivera told Hannity on Tuesday that Trump's interest in the presidency shouldn't be treated as a joke.

'He has far more experience in management than the current occupant of the White House,' Rivera said.

'I think he'd be an excellent president, but Donald has to do it this time. He can't just flirt with it.'

'He has to commit to it,' Rivera said, 'and he has to articulate the conservative philosophy that he does in the boardroom, on and off camera.'

Trump said on the show that the Obama administration's foreign policy experts 'don't know what they're doing. That's where it all starts.'

'They can't negotiate,' he said.

'You look at what's going on with Iran, where they take the sanctions off in the middle of the negotiation. You should make the sanctions tougher.'

NBC did not respond to a request for comment about the status of Trump's contract.
