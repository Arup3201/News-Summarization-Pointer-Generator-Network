A pedestrian who was hit by a cyclist died from a massive blood clot six days after doctors failed to spot a badly injured artery in his neck, an inquest has heard.

David Purkis, 58, from West Wickham, was walking along Regent Street in London when he was hit by a cyclist on July 25 last year.

Both the married father-of-two and the cyclist appeared unharmed at the time and spoke together before parting ways.

Mr Purkis was taken to Princess Royal University Hospital in Bromley three days after he was hit in London

Mr Purkis was taken by ambulance to Princess Royal University Hospital in Kent three days later with blurred vision, dizziness and a headache and given a CT scan.

Dr Sale Ogbobi, a consultant radiologist, who is being represented during the inquest along with Kings College Hospital where the Mr Purkis died, was responsible for reporting on the scan's results.

He told the court: 'I was looking out for previous injury and with his history of the accident three days before, I was looking for what you would expect from a head injury.

'He had slurred speech and dizziness so the most likely cause was a head injury, that was what I was treating this as.'

Expert witness, neurosurgeon Dr Peter Ward, told Southwark Coroner's Court earlier that a 'trained radiologist' should have noticed in the CT scan that Mr Purkis had suffered from a dissected artery in his neck which was causing blood clots to the brain.

Dr Ogbobi, who was looking at the scan from his computer at home, said the software did not have a 'stroke setting' at the time, which contributed to him not diagnosing the problem.

'After reviewing the images later, I saw what I could have done to deduce this and ordered a stroke setting to be put on my computer,' he said.

A consultant in the A&E department, Dr Andrew Hobart, said Mr Purkis had not shown 'clinical signs of a stroke' when he arrived at hospital on July 28 last year three days after the collision.Â 

'It was noted his blurred vision had started that day at lunch time and that he had had been in a bike collision,' he said.

'However, he did not have symptoms of the accident and his CT scan was reported as normal.'

Mr Purkis was discharged in the early hours of July 29 but was rushed back by ambulance that afternoon with paramedics suspecting a stroke.

'I do not think the incident with the collision led to the underlying causes of Mr Purkis' death'

Dr Andrew Hobart, A&E department

'He was seen immediately by the stroke team and sent for another CT scan,' he said.

'Contrary to the radiologist report, there were signs of a stroke and the second scan showed a dissection of his artery at the base of his neck, causing a blockage.'

Mr Purkis was taken to Kings College Hospital hours later where he went through a decompression surgery the next day to reduce swelling of his brain.

'However, his consciousness level decreased and on August 3, he died as a result of the major stroke,' he said.

'The CT scan would have shown possibilities of a stroke and had it given that information, Mr Purkis would have been referred to the stroke team immediately.'

Although Dr Hobart said the dissection of the artery could happen 'any time' after an accident, the longer the delay 'the less likely the accident caused the dissection'.

'The collision with the bicycle may have caused the dissection but it might not have caused it at all.

'I do not think the incident with the collision led to the underlying causes of Mr Purkis' death.'

Earlier Dr Ward said the dissection could have been caused by the patient's hypertension and high cholesterol, two long term factors which can lead to the condition.

The inquest continues.
