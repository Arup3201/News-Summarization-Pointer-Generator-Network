Ketamine should be upgraded to a Class B substance, Government advisers have said.

The drug, also known as Special K, is currently rated Class C.

But the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) has now recommended that it should be reclassified because of the mental and physical harm it causes.

Ketamine users as young as 20 are having to have their bladders removed due to heavy consumption of the drug, ACMD chairman Professor Les Iversen warned earlier this year.

Normally, the bladder wall expands when filled with urine and contracts when emptied.

But extreme ketamine use can cause stiffness and scarring in the bladder walls, meaning it can only expand to a tenth of its normal size. Some drug abusers face wearing a catheter for life.

Originally designed as an anaesthetic and tranquilliser, often used on horses during veterinary surgery, ketamine was banned as a recreational drug in 2006.

An estimated 120,000 people used it in England and Wales during 2012/13, figures suggest.

Home Secretary Theresa May commissioned the ACMD in March last year to refresh its advice on ketamine, which was last reviewed in 2004.

The council said: 'The ACMD recommends that ketamine be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) as a Class B substance.

'This was not a unanimous decision but it is a majority recommendation from both the council and its Ketamine Working Group.

The advice says that 'although there is limited evidence of ketamine misuse causing social harm, evidence of physical harmÂ  - mainly chronic bladder toxicity' - has increased since the last recommendation of 2004.

If the drug is upgraded to Class B, people caught with it in their possession could face up to five years in prison and ketamine dealers could be jailed for up to 14 years.

Other Class B drugs include cannabis, amphetamines, such as speed, and barbiturates.

Earlier this year surgeons in Leeds, London and Bristol said there were a growing number of young people struggling with severe side effects. Teenagers are having their bladders stretched and removed as a result of taking it.

David Gillatt, one of the UK's leading urological surgeons, told Channel 4 News he had removed three bladders by June.

He said: 'Ketamine gets into the urine and inflames the bladder, it makes the lining come off like a burn. As it tries to heal itself, it scars and becomes a small shrunken bladder.

'Some users experience pain in the lower abdomen, blood in their urine and problems controlling their bladders.'
