Murder probe: Dr Gary Hughes was found dead at his home in Feock, and his wife Marion has been detained

A woman held on suspicion of stabbing her GP husband to death ‘truly loved him’, his sister said last night.

Dr Gary Hughes was found yesterday with chest wounds at the £700,000 riverside bungalow he and his wife Marion shared in a picturesque Cornish village.

Dr Hughes’s younger sister Nina Davey, 51, said:  ‘The whole family is devastated. He truly, truly cared for her and loved her, and she loved him.

‘The police have called it a domestic incident.’

Police confirmed that they found the body of a man aged around 60 inside the couple’s home at Feock, near Truro.

A 58-year-old woman remains under police guard at hospital in Treliske.

The couple have two grown-up sons – Mark, 27, a doctor, and Sam, a PhD student.

Detective Inspector Ben Beckerleg of Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'This is the beginning of an investigation.

'But early indications suggest this was a domestic incident and no-one else is being sought at this time.

'An investigation had now begun to fully understand the circumstances and events leading up to this man's death.'

Neighbour,
Chris Young, said: 'When it comes so close to your doorstep it is very 
worrying. This is a very quiet area with very few passers-by.'

Villager Cynthia Vanstone said: 'He was a lovely doctor. He was willing to help anyone'.

Dr Hughes, qualified in 1977, was a Senior Partner at the Clinton Road NHS surgery in Redruth, Cornwall.

Investigation:On Friday police had sealed off Dr Hughes' property in Feock, Cornwall, where he was found with stab wounds
