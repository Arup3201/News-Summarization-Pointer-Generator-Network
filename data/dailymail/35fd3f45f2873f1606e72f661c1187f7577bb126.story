The Royal Family are famed for their love of horses – and it’s never too early to give the latest arrival his first taste of life in the saddle.

So Santa is bringing two-year-old Prince George his own special mount for Christmas – a rocking horse.

The gift is believed to be from the Duchess of Cambridge’s parents Carole and Michael Middleton – and is thought to come with an unusual twist... zebra stripes.

Riding high: Santa is bringing two-year-old Prince George, above, his own rocking horse for Christmas

Hand-carved: This rocking zebra comes with a price tag of £4,650 - but the Middletons couldn't resist

The hand-carved toy is sure to earn the approval of George’s father, who campaigns to protect wildlife.

And though the price tag of £4,650 might make some bridle, Mrs Middleton couldn’t resist.

‘A rocking horse has been on the Christmas list for some time,’ a source close to William and Kate said. Mrs Middleton is said to have spotted the unusual toy at a country fair. 

‘Carole saw it, absolutely loved it and called up to make some enquiries,’ a source said. 

The eye-catching toy is made by a family firm Stevenson Brothers, of Ashford in Kent. It can be purchased through a number of select London stores including Harrods and Dragons of Walton Street.

A spokesman for Stevenson Brothers said that they did not know whether an order had been placed by the Middletons.

It’s understood that William and Kate have bought George a Brio Deluxe Railway Set, which includes trains, a track, figures and some scenery. Sets start from about £40 and can cost up to £200.

Bedtime story: Prince George is expected to receive Happy Hooves Oh! Oh! Oh! by Anna Bogie

‘William and Kate love traditional toys and George loves toy trains, he is mad about them, so he is getting one of those too,’ said the source.

The Prince’s parents are also understood to be considering buying George a retro-style ride-on car by Oskar&Catie costing £85.

And he is also expected to receive Happy Hooves Oh! Oh! Oh! by Anna Bogie, a charming illustrated book about animals preparing for Christmas.

William and Kate read to Prince George at bedtime and one of their favourite stories is said to be the first in this series, called Happy Hooves, Ta Dah! 

Other gifts for the young Prince include a bespoke tree house for the grounds of the Cambridges’ new home, Anmer Hall in Norfolk. 

They will be celebrating their first Christmas there, and Kate is said to have put a huge effort into decorating George’s nursery. 

Those hoping to see Prince George when the Royals go to church at Sandringham on Christmas Day will be disappointed, as William and Kate plan to leave him at home. George was missing last year too, when Kate told one well-wisher that he was ‘playing with the wrapping paper’.
