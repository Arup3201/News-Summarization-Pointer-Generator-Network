An adoring boyfriend literally went to the ends of the world to give his girlfriend the best birthday present.

In December last year, filmmaker Jackson Harries' girlfriend Ella Denton 'jokingly' challenged him to get from the UK to Sydney for her 19th birthday, during a Skype conversation.

Jackson was up for the adventure and filmed his 28-hour trip to give Ella, 19, who had been travelling for three months with three more to go, a surprise birthday to remember.

Making his way to his UK departure airport, Jackson decided surprising his girlfriend was too good an opportunity to miss

The couple: Jackson shared a photo of Ella on his Instagram account to more than 1.6 million followers in May

Jackson explained on Jacksgap.com that with the help of Ellaâ€™s best friend, he organised to travel out and see his girlfriend on her birthday.

The five-and-a-half minute video starts with the couple's emotional Skype conversation, in which Ella tells Jackson how much she misses him.

'I miss you. I can't come home, I want to, but I don't. Is that selfish?' Ella said in the filmed Skype chat. Jackson then tells his girlfriend that he will come to her then.

Ella then suggests the pair make a film and instructs Jackson on the details of the challenge to get to Sydney.

His 28-hour journey started with a 10-hour flight from the UK, pictured, to Hong Kong, followed by a 10-hour stop over before his flight flight to Sydney

'You've got to pick a random date, don't tell me when it is, book your flight, tell me you've booked your flight but don't tell me when the date is,' Ella said.

The next frames of the video show Jackson packing his bag and heading to the airport.

'So the other day on Skype Ella jokingly challenged me to book a spontaneous flight and come out and see her in Australia,' Jackson said while making his way to the airport.

'Three days out from Ella's birthday and so I thought it might be a suitable idea to do exactly that.'

Once at the airport Jackson checked in and boarded the plane, with the first leg of his journey a 10-hour flight to Hong Kong, where he had a 10-hour stopover.

Following this, Jackson had a 10-hour flight to Sydney. 'I did it, I landed in Sydney,' he said upon his arrival the day before Ella's birthday. He then outlines his plan to surprise his girlfriend the next morning.

While making his way to Ella in the video, the young filmmaker stopped to pick up some flowers at a florist for the special occasion.

During his approach to see his girlfriend at her home, Ella is seen talking with a friend who suggested the birthday girl enter the house's garage as part of Jackson's surprise birthday plans.

From outside, he can be seen hiding to the side of the garage door before it opens and seconds later, he shows himself to Ella.

Unaware of the reason why she had been brought down to the garage, Ella is left dumbfounded at what she sees.

Completely stunned, the couple hug and kiss as Ella expresses her astonishment at seeing her boyfriend and eventually they end up sitting on the garage floor still embracing.

The film then finishes with the couple running into the water at a Sydney Harbour beach.
