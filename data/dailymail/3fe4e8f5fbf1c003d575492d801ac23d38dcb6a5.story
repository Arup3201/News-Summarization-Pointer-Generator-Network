A
 grand jury indicted a Mississippi girl's softball coach and his 
pregnant wife on Friday on charges they engaged in oral sex with a 
15-year-old player on his team, according to authorities and court 
records.

Michael Porter, 27, 
the former softball coach at Ridgeland High School in suburban Jackson, 
and his wife, Blair, 26, who taught at a nearby middle school, have each
 been indicted on one count of sexual battery of a child, Madison County
 District Attorney Michael Guest said.

The
 alleged incidents, which were reported to police by the now 16-year-old
 girl's mother, took place between October 2013 and April 2014, 
according to the indictment, which said both of the defendants engaged 
in oral sex with the girl.

The police report noted that the girl was being contacted by the couple after school hours and that it 'went well beyond that of a teacher student relationship.'

The mother told investigators she suspected that the inappropriate behavior began while her daughter was a student at Old Towne Middle School.

Police were able to read text messages between the couple and the student thanks to their search warrant, finding both nude photos and sexually explicit language.

WLBT reports the alleged victim was on a team being coached by Michael Porter.

When confronted by police, the alleged victim admitted to a sexual encounter at the couple's home and another at Ridgeland High School.

That second incident allegedly took place in the school's press box, according to the Assistant D.A.

The indictment suggests that it was Blair Porter who arranged the meetings.

The
 couple was freed on bond on Friday pending a trial scheduled for 
February, Guest said.

If convicted, each faces a maximum sentence of 30 
years in prison, he said.

Michael
 Porter's bond was set at $25,000, while Blair Porter's bond was set at 
one-fifth that amount because she is pregnant, Guest said.

Both Porters have been fired by the Madison County School District, he said.

An attorney for the couple did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
