They are 'Anni's army' - more than 150 pupils at a remote Indian school who now have two new classrooms thanks to funds donated in memory of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani.

As her family struggles to come to terms with not knowing exactly how she died, they can at least take comfort that something positive has come from her passing.

The Anudanit Ashram school in Guhi, 135km from Nasik in the state of Maharashtra, western India, has a whole new building in Anni's honour – though pupils and teachers have no idea who she actually was.

Smiling for Anni: Pupils love having extra space to learn, but have no idea about the woman in whose memory their new building was constructed 

Her husband Shrien Dewani, accused of ordering her killing in South Africa four years ago, returned to Britain yesterday after being allowed to walk free without giving evidence when his trial in Cape Town collapsed on Monday in a case which gripped the world.

But to the 150 students at Anudanit Ashram, hers is just a name on a plaque which adorns their new school building.

The families of both Anni and Shrien contributed funds to UK charity Sewa, which raised £15,394 in total to construct the extension,

Around £12,000 of that came from millionaire businessman Shrien Dewani’s family, who donated it to Wanvasi Kalyan Ashram, an NGO in India which runs the Anudanit Ashram school.

The school’s headteacher, Ishwar Lal, 46, said pupils and teachers were very grateful for the new building, but have no idea why there is a plaque with Anni's name on it.

'After repeated inquiries from teachers and curious students, I asked the NGO that helped us build the classes about Anni Dewani, but I was only told she was a social activist in the UK,' said Mr Lal, who also teaches English.  

The £15,000 building has two classrooms to help the school cope with 150 pupils from 50 different villages

Anni Dewani was murdered by two gunmen after being dragged from a taxi in a Cape Town township in 2010

The school, which takes children with predominantly tribal and rural backgrounds from 50 nearby villages, was established 28 years ago and used to have just five classrooms.

But with the extension, it now has seven and much more room for lessons. 

The building was completed in October last year but Wanvasi Kalyan Ashram is still clueless as to who Mrs Dewani was and has no idea of her horrific killing at the hands of two gunmen in the Gugulethu township of Cape Town in November 2010. 

Sanjay Kulkarni, 46, organisation secretary of the NGO, said: ‘Whoever this Anni Dewani is we want to thank her for what she's done for us.

'These classrooms make it possible for these children to learn and without this school they'd have no education because the nearest town is so far away.

'Mrs Dewani has helped us to build a better school and accommodate more pupils and we cannot thank her enough for that.' 

Space is tight for pupils, but has been expanded greatly by the two new classrooms in Anni's memory

Anudanit Ashram school needs three more classrooms according to Sanjay Kulkarni, organisation secretary of the NGO which helps support it

Mr Kulkarni said the school now needs three more classrooms, so that every year will have a proper classroom, and is hoping to get more funds.

Anni Dewani's mother spoke exclusively to MailOnline yesterday for the first time since her son-in-law was dramatically cleared of her daughter's murder, calling him a 'coward'.

Devastated Nilam Hindocha said Dewani had been as pathetic for applying to get his charges dismissed as he had been on the night he abandoned Anni with two gunmen on the night she was shot dead.

'He didn't have the guts to face us. He was a coward in the court, always a coward,' she said, just after watching Dewani's 'VIP' arrival back in Britain on television.

Shrien Dewani and brother Preyen are whisked away from Gatwick Airport yesterday morning

She spoke after an 'elated and relaxed' Shrien Dewani flew back into Gatwick today on a £3,000 flight - and was rushed through the airport by police and airport security.  

Mrs Hindocha is preparing to leave South Africa after spending more than two months waiting for her son-in-law to give evidence at his trial about the night her daughter Anni was killed. 

Speaking two days after the judge threw out all charges against the 34-year-old bisexual, the mother-of-three said she was still haunted about him leaving Anni alone with her killers.

'I don't think any other men would leave their wives like that. If he really loved her he would have fought for her. 

'I didn't see any marks on him, there was no sign that he had put up any fight for her. He had thought only about himself.

'I asked him why he seemed so normal, so unhurt, there was nothing wrong with him. I kept asking him about that, why he had got away without injuries, but he never answered me.

'I kept asking why he left Anni all alone with those men. How could he have just left her with them and he was freed and not even hurt?'
