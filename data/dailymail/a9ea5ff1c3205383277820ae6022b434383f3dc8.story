An England footballer was left needing hospital treatment for a head injury as a Christmas party descended into a brawl, it has been reported.

Witnesses have claimed that Queens Park Rangers defender Steven Caulker was left with 'blood pouring down his face' after trouble started at a pub in Wandsworth, London.

The £40,000-a-week England star was rushed by ambulance to a west London hospital after police officers were called to a 'disturbance' at the Ship Inn.

According to a report in the Sun, the incident unfolded after a woman spilled a drink on former England defender Rio Ferdinand - also a QPR player.

Team mate Joey Barton is reported to have stepped in as peacemaker as a row erupted between footballers and other pub goers.

Witnesses later saw Mr Caulker with blood coming from a wound on his head. 

QPR have denied he was involved in a brawl but confirmed he suffered a head injury. 

The club's owner says the one-cap England star sustained the wound after slipping over.

An onlooker told The Sun: 'Caulker split his head open and blood was pouring down his face. There was claret everywhere. The players piled out of the pub but the bouncers stopped us leaving.

'Joey Barton was the peacemaker. When it all kicked off, he was in the middle, trying to break it up. It was horrible.' 

The report says that about 20 QPR and Crystal Palace players were at the pub on Sunday night.

A police spokesman said: 'Police were called at 6.45pm to the Ship Inn on Sunday December 7 to reports of a disturbance.

'Officers attended and discovered a man with a head injury. He was taken by ambulance to a West London hospital. There were no arrests and inquiries continue.' 

A spokesman for Queens Park Rangers Football Club said Mr Caulker did require treatment for a cut to a head - but denied it was the result of a fight. The player has yet to comment on the matter.

A statement said: 'Following Saturday's Premier League win versus Burnley, and with no further fixture for nine days, the club can confirm players were allowed to have a Sunday lunch together.

'Steven Caulker was not involved in an altercation. He did suffer a cut to his head, which he received treatment for at hospital before being discharged on the same evening.'

QPR owner Tony Fernandes took to Twitter to play down the reports and claimed that Steven Caulker (pictured during a game) sustained the injury after slipping over

QPR owner Tony Fernandes took to Twitter to play down the reports.

He wrote: 'I'm aware of some headlines appearing in tomorrow [Tuesday's] newspaper. After a great win boys were given permission for a Sunday lunch.

'Team is very united and really playing for each other. Steven Caulker slipped over and hurt his head and is fine. Nothing else to report.

'Great team spirit. We are one. Best I've seen since being chairman. A few sensational headlines but team has done us proud.' 

Crystal Palace has declined to comment. Rio Ferdinand, Joey Barton and Steven Caulker were not immediately available for comment.

A worker at the Ship Inn this morning said the pub had no comment to make.
