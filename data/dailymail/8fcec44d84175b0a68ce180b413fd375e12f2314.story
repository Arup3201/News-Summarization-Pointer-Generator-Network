She and Prince Harry may have parted ways, but Cressida Bonas is certainly making the point that  she hasn't severed ties with his famous family.

And mirroring Kate Middleton's Middleton reaction when her and Prince William briefly separated, Cressida is also making sure she is seen out enjoying the London nightlife, and looking sensational while doing it.  

The 25-year-old was seen strolling hand-in-hand with the Prince Harry's cousin Beatrice as they enjoyed an evening out at Annabel's in London.

As close as ever: Cressida Bonas was seen strolling hand-in-hand with Prince Harry's cousin Beatrice last night as the pair made their way towards Annabel's in London

High spirits: The aspiring model, who split from the fourth in line to the throne three weeks ago, appeared to be in good spirits as she clung tightly to her friend's hand

The pair, who were also joined by 
Princess Eugenie and Beatrice's long-time boyfriend David Clark, sported
 bight smiles and appeared deep in conversation as they made their way 
towards the exclusive establishment.

Cressida slipped into a slinky midnight blue gown by Stella McCartney with an elegant halter neckline and floor-sweeping hem for the occasion.

Showcasing her willowy figure in the form-fitting frock, the model appeared in high spirits and didn't leave the upmarket club until 3am.

She left her golden tresses loose to cascade in voluminous curls around her shoulders and opted for a natural beauty look, kept her make-up understated and simple.

Beatrice was just as glamorous in a billowy blue skirt which she teamed with a ruched blouse.

Clutching a violet, jewel embellished purse, she accessorised with a statement bracelet and chunky gold necklace.

Close friends: Beatrice's sister Eugenie is also a good friend of the pretty blonde and introduced her to her cousin Prince Harry

Stella McCartney blue dress

WOW!

Is Prince Harry mental? Even when she's dressed down in Dr Martens we've always thought that Cressida Bonas was pretty much perfection, but she completely hit it out of the park in this head-turning Stella McCartney gown last night (to the surprise of no one). Harry, get this girl back!

The gorgeous 25-year-old oozed vivacious energy in the figure-hugging sapphire blue dress which featured a flattering high neck and fishtail hem. This is how you show an ex what he's missing!

Doing well: It was a very different look for Cressida who was last seen looking thin and rather pale while out in London's Notting Hill earlier this month

Stunning: The model slipped into a slinky midnight blue gown with an elegant halter neckline and floor-sweeping hem for the evening out

Dressed up: Beatrice cut a glamorous figure in a billowing blue skirt which she teamed with a simple blouse and statement bracelet

Tidy: Cressida swept her long golden locks into a casual bun to reveal her elegant drop earrings as she made her way out of the establishment

The Princess completed her evening outfit with a pair of pointed toe stiletto heels that featured a strap detail across her foot and ankle.

Beatrice's sister Eugenie was the first to introduce Cressida to their cousin with the pair dating for two years before they split three weeks ago.

The news came just one month after they attended their first official engagement together with some reports suggesting the blonde had become too 'clingy'.

The aspiring actress cut a pale and thin figure when she was last seen walking through London's Notting Hill at the beginning of the month, but now seems to be changing her strategy, adopting the one successfully used by the now Duchess of Cambridge when Prince William called time on their romance for a brief period in March 2007.

Kate said ‘yes’ to a slew of invitations and, in public at least, appeared more vibrant and sociable than she had been for some time.

She was soon joined in London by her sister Pippa, who had just finished university and moved into Kate’s Chelsea flat. Spray-tanned and blow-dried, the two appeared together at a series of upmarket social events.

Kate was still only 25, a single girl with the world at her feet – and a taxi waiting outside. Although she was heartbroken, she wasn’t going to show it.

William, meanwhile, spent the summer at his barracks, fulfilling Royal duties, playing polo and enjoying a few - rather raucous - nights out with friends.

It wasn't long before Kate's plan worked and the two secretly got back together on June 9, when she attended a party at his barracks to celebrate the end of training.

Glamorous night out: Princess Eugenie was elegant in a deep purple shift dress in a similar style to Cressida's floor-length gown

Late night: The group left the nightclub at 3am

Handsome: Beatrice's boyfriend David Clark looked dapper in crisp white shirt and bow tie as he wrapped his arm around the Princess later in the night

Fancy footwear: David completed his outfit with a pair of embossed slippers from Oliver Brown

Gentleman: David had walked a little way ahead, leaving the girls to chat in private

While Cressida now seems to be copying Kate, and ensuring she is seen out with Harry's nearest and dearest, the separation has obviously been tough on her.

Meanwhile her erstwhile beau appears to have been having the time of his life recently as he attended his best friend Guy Pelly wedding to American socialite, Lizzy Wilson in Memphis.

The Prince, who was seen 'twerking' on the dance floor, was having such a good time at the 'unbelievably wild' party that he made the band play five encores as he kept the party going beyond the 1am finish time.

Cressida was originally expected to attend the wedding alongside the Princes, but it is thought she and Harry separated after arguing about the trip.

The model was spotted the week before pacing the streets outside the office in the West End where she has a job in marketing, biting her nails and with tears in her eyes.

She has also reportedly been given compassionate leave from work to consider her future and has cut an increasingly wan figure as the separation continues.

Split: Prince Harry and Cressida dated for two years before splitting three weeks ago. They were pictured here watching a rugby union match between England and Wales in March
