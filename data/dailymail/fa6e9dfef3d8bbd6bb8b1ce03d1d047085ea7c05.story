An 'aggressive' Oxford University bursar was sacked from a college run by a former BBC boss after a conspiracy to oust her, a tribunal heard today.

Jean Wright, 60, claimed she was fired from her role after she pushed for a university archivist colleague to be dismissed over harassment allegations - a move she says turned other staff against her.

College master Mark Damazer CBE, a former controller of BBC Radio 4, rubbished the 'spurious' allegation, saying it was 'untrue and without foundation.'

Mrs Wright, from Kidlington, Oxfordshire, is suing St Peter's College for public interest disclosure, unfair dismissal and disability discrimination.

The home bursar said depression affected her work, but Mr Damazer said the college was not initially aware of her condition and, even if it had been, believed it did everything it could to help her.

St Peter's College's alumni includes actor Hugh Dancy, Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and former FA executive David Davies.

Mr Damazer, who was awarded his CBE for services to broadcasting, took up his role at the college in October 2010.

Early in his time there, Mrs Wright - an employee for 17 years - told Mr Damazer she was angry with how the college handled a complaint she made the previous year about volunteer archivist Geoffrey Fouquet.

Mr Fouquet had apologised following an investigation but Mrs Wright made renewed allegations of harassment and bullying in June 2012 and a new probe was launched.

This was dismissed but Mr Damazer decided he wanted to replace Mr Fouquet by Christmas 2012.

Mrs Wright appealed the probe's findings but when this was rejected she took time off from work.

Around the same time there were concerns about an investigation Mrs Wright led into allegations about another member of staff, Roger Hall, which resulted in his dismissal.

This decision was subsequently overturned, after which Mrs Wright met Mr Damazer.

'She asked me if she might still be able to sack Roger because he was "no good" and he should have done more about his dyslexia,' Mr Damazer told the employment tribunal in Reading, Berkshire.

In early 2013, upset employees began to make complaints about Mrs Wright, including that she was 'being very difficult and making their lives at work constantly unpleasant', Mr Damazer said.

'The nature of the complaints against the claimant were similar in that staff advised that she had been aggressive, hostile, threatening and abusive,' the former BBC controller said.

Following an investigation, 12 gross misconduct allegations were made and Mrs Wright was sacked as a result in mid-2013.

Mr Damazer said: 'I know that the claimant has suggested that the disciplinary process was somehow orchestrated by various people within the college as a result of her complaints about Mr Fouquet. I am not aware of any such connection.

'The claimant has sought to make spurious allegations about matters which do not pertain to her dismissal in order to cause damage to the college and to myself. These allegations are untrue and without foundation.

'The college has sought at all times to deal with the claimant's behaviour and the complaints about her in a fair and appropriate way but could not simply ignore so many staff in distress, some of whom wished to leave their long-standing posts because of her aggression, threats and hostile approach.

'While I was not directly involved in the decision making process I believe that the claimant was shown on the evidence to have acted in a way which was not only reprehensible in itself but an abuse of power in respect of her subordinates.

'The college stands by its decisions in relation to the claimant and notes that in the claimant's absence, the college staff are much happier.'

Mr Damazer added that he was not aware Mrs Wright had been suffering from a condition which made her disabled under the Equality Act 2010.

She had 20 days off in October 2012 and had 12 counselling sessions before being signed off with depression in December 2012 and work-related stress in January 2013.

'The college was not aware of the claimant's disability at the relevant time,' Mr Damazer said.

'Having now had sight of the medical reports, it is difficult to see what else could have been done to accommodate the claimant.'

Mrs Wright's role included managing finances and budgets, overseeing accommodation needs for more than 200 students, cleaning rooms and managing events.

'The fact that she was able to undertake these complex duties practically is not indicative of the disability she describes,' he added.

The college head added that he knew Mrs Wright made negative comments about his appointment, claiming he was not concerned with staff welfare - something he said was untrue.

He said: 'I have always sought to be both equitable in tone and keen to stress the importance of fairness to all.'

Mr Damazer said he organised a Christmas party at his home but said Mrs Wright was not keen on the idea.

'A party was arranged and was a success although the claimant did not attend this function, subsequent Christmas staff parties or the annual summer parties that my wife and I introduced,' he said.

Mr Damazer and Mrs Wright are due to give further evidence to the hearing tomorrow.

The case continues.
