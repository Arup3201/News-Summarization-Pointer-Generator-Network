ENGLAND

ALASTAIR COOK - 5

Captained pretty well in the first innings, appearing to have learned the lessons from Headingley. In the second innings, he was too reactionary. Was unlucky to be bowled round his legs and dropping Dhoni reflected a scrambled mind.

SAM ROBSON - 7

An old-fashioned opener and judging by the way he batted after such a long stint in the field, he appears to be mentallytough. There is still a concern when the ball is full around off stump.

GARY BALLANCE - 7

Was very composed in the first innings — just what you need from your No 3. Still susceptible to the inswinger, but if he keeps going like this England will have found a decent replacement for Jonathan Trott.

IAN BELL - 6

Got to be careful he does not go back to the Ian Bell of old — the maker of pretty but infuriating 20s and 30s. That is especially important now that Trott and Kevin Pietersen are no longer there and Cook is struggling. Fielding getting better with age.

JOE ROOT - 9.5

He was brilliant on a surface that did not suit his back-foot tendencies. The tempo of his 154 was helped by the aggression of Stuart Broad, but he shepherded the last few wickets superbly. After his 200 against Sri Lanka, it’s all very encouraging. I also like his feistiness.

MOEEN ALI - 5

Will be disappointed with his first-innings dismissal. He should have known that this was a surface where you stand up and ride the bounce, not turn your back on it. Bowling improved, and took some vital wickets, including both India’s openers in the second innings.

MATT PRIOR - 4

His keeping reflected where his body is at: he took a good one to his left on the first morning, then dropped three to his right as the game progressed. He needs a good series, because Jos Buttler is breathing down his neck.

BEN STOKES - 5

Looks low in confidence with the bat, but has knack of taking wickets. Not sure England have worked him out. If he is a batting all-rounder, he can go in at No 6 and England can play a frontline spinner. If he is a bowling all-rounder, he is vulnerable if they do draft in Simon Kerrigan.

STUART BROAD - 9

Just a fantastic player, with a great cricket brain. Never gives up. If I was captaining against him, I would always be doubly switched on.

LIAM PLUNKETT - 5

He showed with that second-innings dismissal of Dhoni that he does not just have to be a bang-it-in bowler. I did wonder why he kept trying bouncers and I just hope he gets a surface later on in this series where he can show he is not one-dimensional.

JIMMY ANDERSON - 9

The world’s gone mad: I can’t believe I’m giving Jimmy nine out of 10 mainly for his batting. His 81 on Saturday really lifted the country after what has happened these last eight months. And the way he kept running in was a reminder of his excellent levels of fitness.

INDIA

SHIKHAR DHAWAN - 4

Two soft dismissals — and he will always be vulnerable if he keeps staying leg side of the swinging ball.

MURALI VIJAY - 9.5

Did brilliantly to score more than 200 runs. Yes, the pitch suited him, but if India can find another superstar batsman they are going to take some series bowling out.

CHETESHWAR PUJARA - 6

Both his dismissals were a bit lame but he looks organised and loves to just bat and bat. Big score just around the corner.

VIRAT KOHLI - 4

He likes to feel bat on ball and that strong bottom hand can get him into trouble in this series.

AJINKYA RAHANE - 5

Unlucky dismissal in the first innings but enough to suggest he will get runs. Looks organised and well-balanced.

MS DHONI - 8

Captained well, apart from when he lost the plot during the last-wicket stand between Root and Anderson. Vulnerable when there is a bit of bounce.

RAVINDRA JADEJA - 6

Struggles outside off with the ball going across him and played an ugly flash in the first innings to one that was too close to cut.

STUART BINNY - 6

Showed yesterday why he was in the side but had a bit of a shocker before. Out for a duck and virtually ignored by his captain.

BHUVNESHWAR KUMAR - 9

Looks a really good player and could trouble Cook if the ball swings. Quicker than he looks and a very handy, gutsy No 9.

ISHANT SHARMA - 8

Possibly the most dangerous bowler on either side, especially bowling a fuller length, but still struggling with no-balls.

MOHAMMED SHAMI - 6

Batted well in that last-wicket stand with Bhuvneshwar, but I was a bit disappointed with his bowling.
