Thomas Cook has come under fire after it emerged that a group of injured servicemen were denied access to aisle chairs and assistance from crew during a recent flight.

War hero Ben Parkinson, who lost both his legs and suffered a devastating brain injury from a bomb blast in Afghanistan, was among a group of fellow injured forces personnel on the flight from Paphos last Sunday.

Parkinson is an ambassador for military charity Pilgrim Bandits, who revealed that a Thomas Cook crew member told them it was 'not my problem' when asked why there were no disabled assistance on board the aircraft.

In an angry post on Facebook, Pilgrim Bandits wrote: 'ThomasCookUK 1st officer's arrogant reply on flight back from Paphos on Sunday to why there was no wheelchair on board for any disabled to use the toilet "It's not my problem, thank you for flying Thomas Cook".'

Pilgrim Bandits was established in 2007 by Special Forces veterans who aim to use their'unique training and experience to help and inspire wounded soldiers to live life to the full.'

Paratrooper Parkinson, who was awarded an MBE for his charity work, was returning from a Forces Families Rest and Recuperation break in Cyprus with the group, which included five injured servicemen.

With no aisle chair, a wheelchair specially constructed to fit down aircraft aisles, on board, the injured servicemen were unable to use the bathroom facilities for the duration of the four and half hour flight.

The Thomas Cook website clearly states its policy on special assistance for reduced mobility passengers, which includes: 'Assistance moving to and from seats on the aircraft, providing use of the on-board wheelchair, helping a passenger to and from the on-board lavatory providing this does not involve lifting or carrying the passenger, assisting a passenger with their hand luggage on board the aircraft.'

Apology: Thomas Cook have apologised for the incident and have launched an investigation

Following a meeting between a Thomas Cook representative and the military charity, the two are now working together to ensure the incident is not repeated.

'We have received an unreserved apology from Thomas Cook,' a spokesperson for Pilgrim Bandits told MailOnline Travel. 

'Following a personal visit from the company’s head of customer complaints Pilgrim Bandits will now be working with Thomas Cook to ensure disabled facilities are provided on every aircraft.'

A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines told MailOnline Travel: 'We’d like to sincerely apologise to Mr Parkinson and his family and assure them that Thomas Cook Airlines takes its responsibilities to disabled customers very seriously - we immediately launched a full investigation into the issues raised by Mr Parkinson about his flight this weekend and we are contacting him as a matter of urgency.'

The flight in question was operated by Smartlynx Airlines and crew on behalf of Thomas Cook.
