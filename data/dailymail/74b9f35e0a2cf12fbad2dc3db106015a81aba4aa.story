Charley Hull was only three when Paul Lawrie came from 10 shots back to win the Open Championship in 1999 but that was her inspiration as she mounted her own remarkable fightback at the Women’s British Open.

The stand overlooking the 18th green at Royal Birkdale buzzed with excited chatter as Hull birdied the final hole, completing a stunning round of 66, arguably her best ever.

After opening her round with two bogies, the Kettering teenager carded nine birdies — including five of the final seven holes — to take her to one under and within striking distance of her first major victory.

On the charge: Charley Hull hits her second shot on the 17th hole during the third round

Hull moved 
from 51st and 11 shots adrift on Friday to tied seventh, three shots 
behind leader Inbee Park of South Korea going into today’s final round. 
But for a brief loss of concentration when she three-putted the 17th, 
she might have been even closer.

She
 said: ‘I said to my dad on  Friday night, “I’m not out of this 
Championship. I can still win it”. I remembered Paul Lawrie at 
Carnoustie was 10 shots behind in the final round. I didn’t have a score
 in mind but 66 is definitely nice.’

Hull,
 18, has boundless potential. She was named Rookie of the Year on the 
Ladies European Tour in 2013 and just over a year on from turning 
professional she already has one win, five second places and one top 10 
major finish to her name.

Hull
 started hitting golf balls at the age of two and retains a childlike 
fearlessness in her game, following her uncomplicated mantra of ‘hit it,
 find it, hit it again’.

‘I
 just go out and do my thing,’ she said. ‘I don’t realise that I play 
aggressive golf but I probably do. If it’s a stupid pin position, I’m 
not going to take it on but if it’s reasonable, I just go for it. Golf 
is a strange sport but it’s only as complicated as you make it. I try to
 keep it simple.’

Impressive: Charley Hull carded a best of the day 66 to move within three shots of the leader

That
 included visualising the pine and beech trees that line the fairways at
 Woburn golf club, her training base between tournaments.

‘I
 find it hard to see links courses because everything is so flat. My 
coach (Lee Scarbrow, who tutored a young Ian Poulter) helps me picture 
the trees. It’s great because I’m changing the whole picture and  it’s 
really helped me this week to imagine tree-lined courses.’

It
 served her well on the par-five 18th, where she had racked up a bogey 
and double bogey on the two previous days.  ‘I tried to pretend it was a
 really wide hole and managed to hit the fairway,’ she said. ‘I was most
 pleased with that because I’ve nearly hit three balls out of bounds to 
the right off the tee this week.’

Several
 life-size cardboard cut-outs of Hull, who supports Liverpool, are 
dotted around the hospitality centre at Royal Birkdale but she claimed 
to thrive on the pressure of playing in front of a home crowd. ‘I feel I
 have stepped up and proved myself. The pressure is good because it 
shows you have played well coming into a tournament.’

Happy returns: Inbee Park of South Korea celebrated 26th birthday with third-round lead and a cake

There
 is a yawning gap of good women British golfers after Dame Laura Davies,
 50, Catriona Matthew, 44, and 41-year-old Karen Stupples, who retired 
this week. But Hull heads a relative wealth of talented young golfers, 
including Northern Ireland’s Stephanie Meadow and Lincolnshire’s Holly 
Clyburn.

Hull,
 who was home schooled from the age of 13 and still relies on her dad 
driving her to Woburn to  practise until sunset most days, once admitted
 she could have  chosen a very different path.

‘I
 would probably have left school at 16,’ she said, ‘My friends are 
beauticians and hairdressers and stuff like that. My friends who  are 
boys are mostly builders. So  I’d have probably gone down the beautician
 road.’

With
 her pinpoint precision and effortless ability to shoot the breeze it is
 a career that would have suited her very well, but hairdressing’s loss 
is very much golf’s gain.
