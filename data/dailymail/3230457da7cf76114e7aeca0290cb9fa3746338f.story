Forget diamond rings, the latest gift women may soon be crossing their fingers for is a little more risqué.

A Milan-based company has developed the rather peculiar idea of high-fashion rings... that double as sex toys. 

Menage A Quatre describes its creations as a series of four accessories focusing on the stimulation of pleasurable areas. 

Milan-based company Menage a Quatre have designed the rings to combine fashion with pleasure

The rings may look beautiful, but they are also practical - being made of 'body safe' materials and easily washable

Despite their elegant and stylish look, the rings have been designed with sexual pleasure in mind.

The rings' intricate design means they could easily been worn out all the time, with no one being any the wiser as to their other use.

They are made of totally 'body safe' materials - 95 per cent pure silver and silicone - and are easily washable.

The company behind the idea state on their website: 'At Ménage A Quatre we believe that female self pleasure is as natural as any other human function' - indeed, the firm says it can 'improve your lifestyle'.

'We developed a product that suggest the
use of the hands as a natural and spontaneous activity, primarily 
focused on the exploration of the body as a way to discover and 
acknowledge one’s pleasure.'

Menage a Quatre state they hope the rings will result in the 'use of the hands as a natural and spontaneous activity, primarily focused on the exploration of the body'

The rings are not currently available for wide sale, but Menage A Quatre hope to receive enough donations through start up site indiegogog.com to launch their business fully to the commercial market.

Currently they have received £476 ($737) of their £16,790 ($26,000) goal, and have a further 33 days to reach it.

If the rings do hit the shelves, there will be four designs to choose from, each with a different arrangement of the silicone beads, intended to give a different sensation. 

While they certainly remove the embarrassment felt by many when purchasing sex toys, it remains to be seen whether these rings will come to rival more traditional jewellery as romantic gifts.
