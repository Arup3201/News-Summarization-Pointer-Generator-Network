Nicknamed Streaks due to their speed and sleek lines, they were the pride of Britain’s railways.

The A4 class locomotives were built in the Thirties to haul the fastest express passenger trains from London to York, Newcastle and Edinburgh.

With their revolutionary design inspired by Bugatti race cars, they were the first of their kind to speed along the tracks at 90 to 100mph, 25mph faster than their predecessors.

The world's fastest steam locomotive, Mallard (far right) and six of her sister trains were gathered in Shildon, County Durham, yesterday

Mallard still holds the record for the fastest steam locomotive ever at 126mph, a speed which electric trains reach every day today

As well as Mallard, the six include Sir Nigel Gresley - named after the designer - Union of South Africa, Bittern, Dominion of Canada and Dwight D. Eisenhower

In their heyday, it was every schoolboy’s dream to drive one — and they still evoke all the romance of the golden age of steam, when British still meant best.

Now the last remaining six have been reunited for one final time.

Among them is the legendary Mallard, which still holds the record for the fastest steam locomotive in the world after hitting 126mph at Stoke Bank, near Grantham on the East Coast main  line in 1938 — a record that’s unlikely ever to be beaten.

The attempt was set up amid great secrecy, not only because the Germans had achieved over 120mph, but also because rival companies in Britain could have stolen a march on the daring record bid.

It was driven that day by Joseph Duddington, 61, assisted by fireman Thomas Bray, whose back-breaking job it was to shovel tons of coal into the white-heat firebox as the rocking train hurtled down the track.

Success: The team from Mallard celebrate their record run near Peterborough 75 years ago. The challenge was so intense it left the loco in need of repair

The 75th anniversary of that epic event, in July last year, triggered the bringing together of the six locos.

They are the only surviving examples of the 35 of their kind that were designed by genius Sir Nigel Gresley for the London & North Eastern Railway and which marked the zenith of British locomotive building.

Polished, oiled and gleaming, the six 100-ton steam locos have been lined up side by side for a week-long display named the Great Goodbye at the National Railway Museum’s site at Shildon, Co. Durham.

Two — Dwight D. Eisenhower and Dominion of Canada — were brought over from museums on the other side of the Atlantic for the reunion, which is attracting tens of thousands of visitors from all over the world.

Like Mallard, which is part of Britain’s National Railway Museum collection, those two are no longer in running order, but merely exhibited in gleaming condition.

Great gathering: Over the last four days 50,000 people have gathered at the National Railway Museum to see the six engines together

Sizing up: The fearsome machines were not just epic in terms of ability, but also sheer scale, as this picture shows

But the other three — Bittern, Sir Nigel Gresley and Union of South Africa, owned by separate rail enthusiasts — still earn a living hauling steam charters on the main line.

Anthony Coulls, senior curator of rail vehicle collections at the museum, said: ‘These locos were built to create an impression and they definitely still do! The drivers were the fastest men on earth — the Formula 1 drivers or airline pilots of their day.

‘These were prestige trains and to be in charge of one was exciting and glamorous.’

The design was a massive success in public relations terms — the public adored them.

One of the A4s — fuelled by up to seven tons of coal — could race between London and Edinburgh, picking up water on the move from long troughs laid between the rails.

Because the work of the two men of the footplate — the driver and fireman — was so arduous, Gresley designed a tiny corridor through the tender that would allow a relief crew to take over on the move.

Precision engineering: Gresley, who designed the trains, had intended for them to eventually reach 130mph, but that dream was never realised

Namesake: Among the visitors was one Mallard David Elcoat ¿ who was born in 1951 and named after the locomotive

Soon after Mallard’s record-breaking run — which left the workings of the thrashed loco needing some repair — World War II would put an end to the most glamorous era on British railways, with the glorious Streaks stripped of some of their streamlining for the duration and plodding along at more pedestrian speeds, their paintwork stained and dirty.

Gresley’s hopes of even higher speeds — 130mph was thought possible — went unfulfilled.

Then diesel and electric locos took over from the Fifties and today reach the once amazing speed of 125mph on a daily basis. But most railwaymen admit today’s trains lack the glamour and looks of the Streaks.

And yesterday, the surviving A4s were back at their gleaming best. Among the visitors was one Mallard David Elcoat — who was born in 1951 and named after the locomotive.

His father was not only a railway enthusiast, but also a loco driver with the rival London Midland & Scottish railway. The museum has copied his birth certificate for their records.

A one enthusiast said: ‘These locos were just superb, and still are. After all, you can’t imagine some-one naming their child after a diesel, can you?’
