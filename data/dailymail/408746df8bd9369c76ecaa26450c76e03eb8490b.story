A diamond-encrusted 155mph motorbike designed by England striker Wayne Rooney has sold on an eBay charity auction for a staggering £109,700.

The flash custom-made chopper, capable of more than 60mph in under four seconds and made by Danish manufacturers Lauge Jensen, attracted 101 bids on eBay.

In the end it was snapped up for £109,700 by an anonymous bidder - believed to be a Red Devils fan - yesterday.
