A Twitter hashtag set up to help a man with Down's syndrome find work has landed him his first job.

Ben Small, 26, was offered a job at the Wilson's Kitchen café in Liverpool after owners Lloyd and Kellie Wilson responded to the appeal - and he started his first shift there yesterday. 

Upon his arrival, he is said to have asked Mr Wilson three questions - if he could have free toast, whether he would be provided with dinner and when the next staff party will be.

In the kitchen: The aspiring chef has been inundated with job offers after a Twitter appeal by his stepmother

The aspiring chef has been inundated with job offers ever since his stepmother Fiona Hodge appealed for help on Twitter, but has now begun work at Wilson's Kitchen as a Saturday job.

Miss Hodge, 46, said: ‘In these early stages it's about him getting used to a greater level of stability and formality in workplace.

‘It's a Saturday job initially, but he's hoping to do up to the 16 hours he's permitted to work eventually. We're going to build up to it. 

'We don't want to overwhelm Ben in his first week, but he might eventually want to find more work and be self-sufficient like anyone else.’

Her original appeal has received more than 800 retweets since she posted the message on March 13 - and was even picked up by comedian Jason Manford.

Mr Small’s father Mike Small, 59, said: ‘We took Ben to meet Lloyd on Thursday and the two of them got on like a house on fire - they were like the best of friends.

‘It made me so comfortable to see them have a chat and a laugh, and it was nice to see Lloyd so relaxed and calm around Ben.

‘It's a family-run business, so it's comforting to know that Ben is not only going to get the support of an employer but support in a family setting, too. We've got him some chef's whites, so he'll definitely look the part.’

Mr Small, who lives in Kensington, Liverpool, has worked with chains such as McDonald's and JD Wetherspoon in the past, but had not been offered any paid period of employment until he started at Wilson's Café.

Lloyd Wilson, owner of Wilson's Café, said: ‘My wife saw the tweet and responded right away to say that Ben would be more than welcome to come to the café and help if he wants.

‘Ben was excited to meet us and wanted to come down straight away. He came with his parents on Thursday and looked at home as soon as he walked in. He's really outgoing and full of life. 

'It looks like he's going to fit in perfectly. Ben's going to start with a Saturday job so there's no pressure on him. He said he really likes to bake, so we're going to get him making some scones and get them on sale to see how he does and see if he enjoys it.

‘He had three vitally-important questions for me: can he have free toast, will they give him his dinner and when will the next staff party be.’
