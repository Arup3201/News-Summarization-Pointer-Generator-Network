A violent criminal was fitted with an electronic tag after stabbing her estranged husband - before she boasted about 'blingin' it up’ with her daughter's help.

Mother-of-two Shona Reese, of Sandwich, Kent, was ordered to wear the electronic monitor after stabbing her husband Colin in the neck.

The 29-year-old was charged with attempted murder but allowed home with the tag - and began posting pictures of it on Facebook spruced up with extras.

One picture showed the tag with red and green studs in the shape of cherries and strawberries, while another had it completely covered in silver studs.

Another photograph showed her young daughter decorating the tag and a caption saying: ‘Erin blingin mummys tag up in her onsie cos thats just how we roll (sic)’.

Reese already had 15 previous convictions including assault, battery, assaulting police, criminal damage and arson when she stabbed her husband last October.

Canterbury Crown Court heard they had a ‘dysfunctional’ marriage characterised by violence on her.

At the time of the attack she and her husband were living apart but had met to go shopping and then went drinking together.

They started rowing on the way home and Reese stabbed her husband in the neck with a kitchen knife, leaving him bleeding profusely from a 4in (10cm) wound.

She told police her husband had gone for her and she had acted in ‘excessive self-defence’.

Reese was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder but later charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

She admitted a lesser charge of unlawful wounding, and on Tuesday was given an eight-month jail sentence suspended for two years.
