The Department of Homeland Security was dragging its feet on processing Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev's U.S. citizenship after a routine background check revealed he had been questioned by the FBI in 2011.

Tamerlan, 26, filed an application for citizenship six months ago but immigration officials had not yet made a decision on his case at the time of the Boston Marathon bombings.

Authorities knew the alleged bomber had a domestic violence charge on his record but the fact he had been grilled by federal agents is reportedly what threw up red flags, halting the progress of his application.

It's not clear what the 26-year-old, who was killed early Friday, was told about why his application was facing delays.

Official reported on Friday that the 
F.B.I. interviewed the older Tsarnaev brother in January 2011 at the 
request of the Russian government, which suspected that he had ties to 
Chechen terrorists.

They said this decision to delay his 
application proved his encounter with the F.B.I. did not go unnoticed by
 the Department of Homeland security.

According to The New York Times, the 
terror suspect's application, presented on September 5, also prompted 
the FBI to do 'additional investigation' of him this year. They didn't reveal how far the probe had gone or what it covered.

Tamerlan's papers were submitted just days after his brother, Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19, had his own citizenship application approved.

According to the Times, officials with Homeland Security contacted the FBI late last year to learn more about its interview with the terror suspect and the agency reported its conclusion that he did not present a threat.

However, immigration officials did not move to approve or deny the application, choosing instead to leave it open for 'additional review.'

On Sunday, U.S. lawmakers from both parties criticized the FBI for failing to spot the extremist leanings of Tamerlan Tsarnaev
 and demanded to know why the agency did not at least follow up with the
 elder brother following a six-month trip to Russia in 2012.

Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-South 
Carolina) went so far as to say 'the ball was dropped' by the federal 
agency by either missing 'a lot of things' during their initial 
investigation of the suspect or did not allow investigators to 'follow 
up in a sound, solid way.'

Under
 the barrage of attacks, the FBI has stood by their initial public 
statement issued earlier last week, which said that the agency closed 
their investigation on the ethnic Chechen in 2011 after failing to find 
any ‘terrorism activity, domestic or foreign.’

On Sunday, House of Representatives 
Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul wrote to the FBI and
 other officials asking why Tamerlan Tsarnaev did not raise suspicions 
after Russia asked the bureau to investigate him two years ago.

'Because if he was on the radar and 
they let him go, he's on the Russians' radar, why wasn't a flag put on 
him, some sort of customs flag?,' McCaul, a Texas Republican, said on 
CNN's 'State of the Union.’

'And I'd like to know what intelligence Russia has on him as well.'

Sen.
 Charles Schumer (D-New York) was largely supportive of the FBI’s 
efforts, but questioned why Tamerlan wasn’t interviewed upon his return 
from Russia, where he had been for six months in 2012.

‘There
 were things on his website that indicated that he had been 
radicalized,’ Schumer said. ‘I think there’s a lot of questions that 
have to be answered.’

The 
FBI interviewed Tsarnaev in 2011, shortly after Russia's Federal 
Security Service asked the agency to look into him as a possible 
Islamist radical who might soon travel to Russia. It was unclear before 
yesterday which foreign country had tipped off the FBI.

When contacted, the FBI referred 
MailOnline to the statement it issued on April 19, saying the FBI’s 
search into Tamerlan’s records, travel history, and internet use yielded
 no results.

Meanwhile, the organization has 
vehemently refuting a claim by the mother of the Tsarnaev brothers who 
said the bureau had spoken to Tamerlan following the two bombs exploding
 at last Monday’s marathon.

FBI
 spokesman Michael Kortan told the Associated Press Sunday that the 
interviews in 2011 with Tamerlan and family members were the agency’s 
only contact with the bombing suspect. The Tsarnaev’s parents, who live 
in Russia,

Less than a 
year after the FBI interview, Tsarnaev did in fact travel to the 
volatile Dagestan region of southern Russia on a six-month trip out of 
the United States. Much of what Tsarnaev did on that trip is still a 
mystery to U.S. investigators, Reuters reported.

Neighbors
 contacted by Reuters say Tsarnaev spent at least a few weeks in 
Dagestan, a predominantly Muslim region in the North Caucasus mountains 
where Islamist militants have long been a thorn in the side of 
governments in Moscow.

Critical: Tsarnaev, who was arrested Friday night, remains in critical condition under heavy guard after he was apprehended in Watertown

Republican Representative Peter King 
of New York told 'Fox News Sunday' he wondered why the FBI did not take 
more action after Tsarnaev returned to the United States last year and 
put statements on his website 'talking about radical imams.'

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was not put on any 
no-fly list of suspected terrorists, U.S. officials said. But his brush 
with the FBI did raise concerns when he applied for U.S. citizenship 
last year, a source close to the bombing investigation said.

Officials
 of the Homeland Security Department decided to give his application 
extra scrutiny because of the FBI interview and also due to an 
allegation against him of domestic abuse on a girlfriend in 2009, the 
source said. The citizenship application was still under consideration 
when Monday's bombing happened.

Tamerlan
 Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with U.S. police. and his brother 
Dzhokhar, 19, remained hospitalized in serious condition on Sunday, 
unable to speak. Three people were killed in Monday's bombing and 176 
were injured.

Republican 
Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said 'the FBI or the system 
dropped the ball' on the elder Tsarnaev. Graham told CNN that U.S. laws 
do not allow the FBI to follow up enough even if it does spot danger.

Democratic
 Senator Charles Schumer of New York told CNN 'there's certainly a lot 
of questions' about the FBI's handling of the case.

One
 U.S. counterterrorism official urged perspective. 'If we thoroughly 
investigated every one of these terrorism tips we get, we'd never get 
anything done,' he said.

Captured: The FBI wanted poster released last night was updated to show that Dzhokhar was in custody

A senior U.S. law enforcement source 
said that the number of tips received from Russian intelligence to the 
FBI each year is 'not that many.'

But
 nationally, he said, the FBI receives at least 100 terrorism tips a day
 - from the public, local and state law enforcement, other federal 
agencies and the intelligence community.

House
 Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent, 
defended the agency. The Michigan Republican said the FBI had performed a
 'very thorough' review of the older brother in 2011, but then it failed
 to receive further cooperation from Russia.

'That case was closed prior to his travel, so I don't think we missed anything,' Rogers said on NBC's 'Meet the Press.'

'At
 some point they (the FBI) asked, is there more clarifying information, 
and never received that clarifying information, and at some point they 
have nothing. You can't ask them to do something with nothing,' Rogers 
said.

But McCaul and King said the handling of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's case looked like it was part of a pattern.

The
 26-year-old 'appears to be the fifth person since September 11, 2001, 
to participate in terror attacks despite being under investigation by 
the FBI,' the pair said in a joint letter.

They
 named the others as Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S.-born cleric and leader of 
al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen who was killed in a U.S. drone strike; 
David Headley, an American who admitted scouting targets for a 2008 
Islamic militant raid on Mumbai; Carlos Bledsoe, who killed an Army 
private outside a military recruiting office in Arkansas in 2009; and 
Nidal Hasan, who is accused of killing 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, in
 2009.

In addition, Umar 
Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to bring down a U.S. jetliner over 
Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, had been identified to the CIA as a 
potential terrorist, the letter said, adding the cases 'raise the most 
serious questions about the efficacy of federal counterterrorism 
efforts.'

The McCaul-King 
letter asked for all information the U.S. government had on Tamerlan 
Tsarnaev before April 15. It was also addressed to Director of National 
Intelligence James Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Janet 
Napolitano.
