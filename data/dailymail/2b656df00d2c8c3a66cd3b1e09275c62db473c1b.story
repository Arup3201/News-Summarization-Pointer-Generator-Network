A nine-year-old Rory McIlroy predicted he would usurp the world's greatest golfer after penning a letter to Tiger Woods back in 1999.

Although the American legend may have never read the prophecy, a New York Times Magazine profile pieced together its contents through interviews with McIlroy and close family members.

Having just won the 1998 Doral-Publix Junior Golf Classic in Florida for the 10-11 age group, the young McIlroy's message was clear: 'I'm coming to get you. This is the beginning. Watch this space.'

When asked if he recalled the letter, the three time major winner sheepishly admitted: 'A lot of those memories have kind of blurred together. But, yeah, it went something like that.'

Whether Woods, ranked an unassailable No 1 at the time, would have paid much attention is unlikely but 16 years later it's the Northern Irishman who heads golf's rankings - while Woods has slipped out of the top 100 for the first time since 1996.

And, not only has McIlroy surpassed him on the course but he has also taken his former idol's role as Nike's poster boy and the face of EA Sports video game.

Meanwhile, McIlroy heads for Masters bulked up in bid to complete a career grand slam by winning his third consecutive major title.

Although the 25-year-old still has a long way to go before surpassing Woods' record of 683 total weeks as world No 1, he is undoubtedly the American's successor as golf's heavyweight star - both on and off the greens. 

And  his obsession with the gym is giving the star more than a helping hand.

'It was when I started to notice results that I fell in love with it,' said McIlroy
