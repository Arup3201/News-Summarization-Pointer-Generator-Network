Stocks ended mostly higher on Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 ending two days of heavy losses, though traders continued to fret over planned changes to the Federal Reserve's easy money policy.

Major indexes posted their biggest weekly declines since April, while the Nasdaq fell for a third straight day on a steep decline in software company Oracle Corp . Markets were volatile, with the Nasdaq at one point dropping more than 1 percent.

The Dow Jones industrial average was up 44 points, or 0.30 percent, at 14,803. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 4.45 points, or 0.28 percent, at 1,592.64. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 7.39 points, or 0.22 percent, at 3,357.

Downward slide: The Dow posted its worst day of 2013 on Thursday after the Federal Reserve said it could end its huge bond-buying program by the middle of next year

Shares have slumped since Wednesday 
when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke laid out the Fed's plans to 
scale back on its $85 billion in monthly asset purchases.

The S&P 
broke under its 50-day moving average, contributing to 4.6 percent 
pullback from its all-time closing high reached on May 21. This retreat 
represents the largest since an 8.9 percent decline between September 
and November.

'A lot of investors thought the 
sell-off was overdone after we broke through those technical levels, but
all the existential things that drove us down are still in place,' said
Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group in New 
York. 'People aren't sure what's going to happen with Fed policy or 
rates or anything else. It is too soon to say we hit a bottom.'

Slightly more stocks rose than fell 
on the New York Stock Exchange while 57 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares 
rose. About 10.29 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock 
Exchange, the Nasdaq and NYSE MKT, above the daily average so far this 
year of about 6.36 billion shares.

Stocks ended mostly higher on Friday, with the Dow and S&P 500 ending two days of heavy losses

When trading began on Friday, the 
S&P 500 had fallen nearly 5 percent from an all-time closing high of
1,669.16 on May 21. However, stocks rebounded after a Wall Street 
Journal analysis said the market may be misreading the Fed and that a 
reduction in bond buying may not come as soon as some expect.

While the S&P turned positive in 
afternoon trading, the 10-year Treasury yield rose to 2.531 percent as 
investors reset expectations after Bernanke gave a more explicit 
timeline for scaling back its bond-buying.

Volatility has spiked since May 22 
when Bernanke first hinted that the Fed may begin to rein in its 
stimulus measures. Analysts cited the quarterly expiration and 
settlement of June equity options and futures contracts on Friday as 
another source of volatility and higher volume.
