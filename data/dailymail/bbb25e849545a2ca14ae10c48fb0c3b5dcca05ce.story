Schoolchildren should be taught using pounds, ounces and yards, not grams and kilometres, David Cameron has claimed.

The Prime Minister insisted he was a 'modern compassionate conservative' but wanted to turn the clock back to using imperial measurements.

Embarking on a media blitz of TV and radio interviews, he also said he was relaxed about gay men kissing in public, hailed Boris Johnson as a 'star player' and revealed he has still not apologised to the Queen for revealing she 'purred' down the phone when Scotland voted against independence.

Mr Cameron has been hoping to use a round of media appearances to get a grip on the coverage of his party conference in Birmingham.

It follows the shock defections of two MPs to UKIP, growing rows over Europe and the resignation of charities minister Brooks Newmark who sent an explicit picture of himself to an undercover journalist.

The Tory leader is expected to use his keynote speech tomorrow to set out his personal plan for Britain.

Appearing on BBC2's Newsnight last night, Mr Cameron was asked a series of questions to shed light on his own character. 

Four decades since metres and litres replaced yards and pints on the curriculum, the Prime Minister suggested he would prefer to see a return to the old system.

'I think I'd still go for pounds and ounces, yes I do,' Mr Cameron told BBC2's Newsnight when asked which should be taught predominantly.

David Cameron has insisted he is 'delighted' at the prospect of Boris Johnson returning to Parliament. 

The Prime Minister rejected suggestions that he was worried about the Commons comeback of his leadership rival.

Asked whether he was 'worried' about Mr Johnson returning to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in May, Mr Cameron told Good Morning Britain: 'No, not at all.'

He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I think Boris is a complete star and what I am pleased about in the Conservative Party is that there isn't just one Prime Minister and one leader - we have got a team of leaders.

'I have got an excellent Home Secretary in Theresa May, you saw the Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday with the grit that he has shown in getting our deficit down and delivering our long-term economic plan. Boris is an outstanding Mayor of London and I am delighted he is coming back to Parliament and I think there are real opportunities for him in the future.'

Mr Cameron said; 'It's a bit like being a football manager. I'm delighted that I have some great strikers to put on the pitch.

'I have the opposite of tall poppy syndrome - I like being surrounded by talented and good people, because politics is a team enterprise. You need a strong team to deal with all the problems you face and Boris will be a very strong part of that team in the next Parliament.' 

The present curriculum, which Tory ministers have said they will skew towards imperial measures, requires only that pupils 'understand and use approximate equivalences between metric units and common imperial units such as inches, pounds and pints'.

It was one of three questions posed to the PM by the programme to try to define his wider stance.

Asked how he would feel if he saw two men kissing in a park, Mr Cameron replied: 'That's fine... I think men should be able to marry each-other and women should be able to marry each-other.

'I can kiss my wife in public, I don't see why you can't kiss your husband,' he said.

However, he gave less definitive in his answer to a third posed dilemma - whether a pharmaceutical firm should recruit a British candidate over a better-qualified foreign one.

'I want to make sure that the pharmaceutical company has good British people to employ. In the end, they have to choose,' he said.

Mr Cameron today revealed he will not follow Labour leader Ed Miliband to deliver a 'no-notes' speech to his party conference.

Last week Mr Miliband was ridiculed after forgetting to mention the deficit during his 69-minute address, claiming he did not want to read a script because he wanted to do politics differently.

However, Mr Cameron plans to use a script so he can 'lay out my plan for Britain'.

He told the BBC: 'I've been leader of my party for eight years and prime minister for four and I think people have a clear idea. I don't see a contradiction: if people are worried, is this country going to deliver for me? Is there a good job for my child? 

'Is there a good school place and is there going to be a clean and safe environment? Are we going to be a country that keeps our promises to the poorest in the world because Britain means something in the world? 

'I think all those things are connected and I think a modern compassionate Conservative can appeal to all of those and it actually all first together.'

Today Mr Cameron has promised 'many more' family doctors after the general election in order to deliver a pledge of extended-hours access to a GP seven days a week for every NHS patient in England.

Doctors' leaders warned that there would need to be significant additional funds and staffing to implement the pledge, announced by the Prime Minister at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham.

But Mr Cameron insisted that 8am-8pm opening, weekdays and weekends, was already in place for seven million patients after the launch last year of a £50 million fund in selected surgeries.

He announced a further £100 million to ensure that at least 10 million are covered in 2015, and a further £400 million is earmarked to make the extended service nationwide over the five years following next May's election.

Mr Cameron told ITV1's Good Morning Britain: 'I think our health service is performing well and it is a testament to the doctors and nurses and all the other staff who work in our NHS, which is a national treasure.

'It's one of the things I care most about in politics and I am really pleased today to be able to signal what you will get from a Conservative government in terms of seven-day access to your GP.' 

David Cameron still not apologised to the Queen in person for the embarrassment caused by his comments that she 'purred' down the telephone when Scotland rejected independence.

Mr Cameron was left red-faced after being caught on camera revealing details of his conversations with the Queen.

On a visit to New York last week, the PM was filmed boasting to former mayor Michael Bloomberg about the call he made to the Queen at Balmoral.

Prime Minister David Cameron today admitted that he will have to apologise to the Queen (left, pictured outside Crathie Kirk in Aberdeenshire) again for revealing details of his conversations over the Scotland result

As the Prime Minister and Mr Bloomberg arrived for a press photo-opportunity, Mr Cameron smiled broadly as he recalled how he was able to tell the Queen it was 'all right' after the referendum resulted in a victory for the No camp.

'The definition of relief, if you are Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, is ringing up Her Majesty the Queen and saying 'Your Majesty, it is all right, it's okay',' Mr Cameron said.

'That was something. She purred down the line.'  

Downing Street has already contacted Buckingham Palace to offer the Prime Minister's apologies and Mr Cameron has said he will say sorry in person when he next meets the Queen for one of his regular audiences.

Asked whether he had given his apologies to the Queen about the incident yet, Mr Cameron told ITV1's Good Morning Britain: 'My office has already registered that very strongly with the Palace and I will do so in person when we next have our audience.

'But I think I have probably said enough about those audiences, so I won't say any more.'

Asked whether he would leave Tory activists 'purring' when he addresses the party conference in Birmingham, Mr Cameron told Sky News's Sunrise: 'That is a word which I'm going to avoid from now on.'
