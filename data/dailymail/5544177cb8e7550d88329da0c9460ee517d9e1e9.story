Out of the running? The Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu was the favourite to become the next Archbishop of Canterbury, but two other candidates are also now being considered

The search for the next Archbishop of Canterbury could take months amid claims that the secretive panel choosing a successor is divided.

Dr John Sentamu, Archbishop of York, was originally the hot favourite to take over from Dr Rowan Williams when he officially steps down in December.

But the Crown Nominations Commission is said to be split over the 63-year-old’s suitability after three days of deliberations ended in deadlock at the end of last week.

While it narrowed the field to a shortlist of three, including Dr  Sentamu, there is a growing belief that the Ugandan-born traditionalist will not get the job.

Sources said that while popular and charismatic, he may lack  the diplomatic skills needed for  Lambeth Palace.

The 16-strong panel is now torn between him and two other candidates, 56-year-old Dr Justin Welby, Bishop of Durham, and 61-year-old Dr Graham James, Bishop of Norwich, who last week said he was ‘praying not to be chosen’.

One Church insider said: ‘Bishop Welby is seen as too conservative and too inexperienced and  Bishop James as too liberal and too dull. There is no outstanding candidate.’

Sources said the CNC, which consists of clergy and lay people, does not have to work to a specific timetable and that it could be months before a decision is reached.

A senior cleric said: ‘The whole thing has become a farce. One minute it is compared to a horse race. The next no one can find a winner.

‘We need to have a much more transparent and representative process.’

Lacking diplomacy? Dr Sentamu with The Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, who will officially step down in December

Other contenders for the post included Dr Richard Chartres, Bishop of London, who is a friend of Prince Charles, and Dr Christopher Cocksworth, the Bishop  of Coventry.

The choice of a replacement for Dr Williams is seen as critical for a Church in danger of splitting over issues such as gay marriage and women bishops.

Dr Williams, 62, has said that his successor would need the ‘constitution of an ox and the skin of a rhinoceros’.

The Church of England said: ‘The work of the Commission continues. There will be no comment on any speculation about candidates or about the CNC’s deliberations.’
