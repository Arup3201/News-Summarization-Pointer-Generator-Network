Sir Alex Ferguson has revealed that he would only point at his watch to influence match officials and opponents despite rarely being aware of how many minutes were left in a match for his Manchester United side to find a goal.

Ferguson's United became famous for winning points in the closing minutes of matches in a timekeeping tactic which soon became labelled as 'Fergie Time'.

Speaking on BT Sport's Clare Balding Meets, Ferguson said: 'Absolutely (other team's were frightened of it). That's why I used to go with my watch.

Ferguson, seen here grabbing former Everton manager David Moyes' watch, has revealed that he would use the 'Fergie Time' tactic to influence the officials

- Ole Gunnar Solskjaer netted three minutes into injury time against Bayern Munich in the 1999 Champions League final to win the trophy for United.

- A goal by Steve Bruce six minutes into stoppage time against Sheffield Wednesday gave Fergie his first title with United in April 1993.

- In 2009 Federico Macheda scored the winner in the 93rd minute for United against Aston Villa in a thrilling 3-2 win in that ultimately clinched yet another league title for United.

- Michael Owen bagged a truly memorable Old Trafford winner with his late striker against rivals Manchester City in 2009. City boss Mark Hughes was furious the six minutes of added on time.  

'But I never looked at my watch. Honestly. I didn’t know how many minutes but it gets across to the opponents and the referee. It was just a little trick.' 

One of United's most famous late victories in recent years came in 2009 when Ferguson's side beat their 'noisy neighbours' Manchester City in an unforgettable derby with a Michael Owen goal deep in stoppage time to claim a 4-3 victory.

City manager Mark Hughes was left bemused at how the referee had played six minutes of injury time when the fourth official had indicated there would be just four added at the end of the 90.

Federico Macheda also announced himself to the Old Trafford crowd with a 93rd minute winner against Aston Villa in 2009. And, in so doing, calmed fears that the Red Devils might let a third consecutive title slip through their fingers.

However, the Old Trafford club's most famous late goal came from the boot of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the Norwegian striker secured the 1999 Champions League title and the Treble in a 2-1 win against Bayern Munich. 

Ferguson's side were 1-0 behind before substitutes Teddy Sheringham and Solskjaer turned the game on its head in a matter of minutes.
