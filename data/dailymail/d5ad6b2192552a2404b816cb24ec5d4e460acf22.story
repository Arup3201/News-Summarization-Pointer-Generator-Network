Luis Suarez has sent messages to his Liverpool team-mates in the England camp warning them he will be fit to play for Uruguay against them in the World Cup.

Footballer of the Year Suarez had surgery on a knee injury he suffered in training last week but has been in contact with some of his Anfield pals to tell them he will see them in Sao Paulo on June 19.

Uruguay’s team doctor Alberto Pan confirmed on Tuesday that Suarez was ‘evolving well’ after his operation.

‘We can happily say Luis’ participation in the World Cup is not ruled out,’ said Pan. ‘It is very risky to give exact dates but the post-operative period has been very good.

‘Luis is very positive. He says he is better every day. Today, he is painless and working on fitness.’

Jordan Henderson, one of five Liverpool players in the England squad, said: ‘I texted him to see if he is doing all right. He is a fighter and come the first or second game of the World Cup, I’m sure he’ll be ready and raring to go.’
