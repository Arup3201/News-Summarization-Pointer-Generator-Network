More than 1,000 'Loony Dookers' started 2013 with a splash as they took their annual dip in Scotland's Firth of Forth today.

The New Year swim at South Queensferry saw brave participants take the plunge for charity dressed in costume ranging from penguins to hula dancers.

The 1,100 Loony Dookers - taken from the Scottish word for bathing, dook - were paraded through the town before jumping in.

These Loony Dookers took to the icy waters of the Firth of Forth as part of Edinburgh's New Year celebrations

Frances Sutton, spokeswoman for 
Edinburgh's Hogmanay, said: 'The Loony Dookers were loving it, they 
marched down the street to a pipe band and took to the water, some only 
ankle-deep but others went under.

'There were people wearing wedding dresses, there was a Fred Flintstone outfit and a very small "mankini". It was brilliant.'

Many took the opportunity to wash away their hangover after Edinburgh's Hogmanay 75,000-strong street party.

Council staff began the big clean up today and already removed 60 to 75 tonnes of rubbish by mid-morning.

Tourists from as far afield as 
Australia travelled to the Scots capital for last night's party, 
headlined by Scots rock band Simple Minds.

After the clock struck midnight fireworks lit up the sky and revellers joined in a mass rendition of Auld Lang Syne.

Edinburgh councillor Steve Cardownie 
said: 'It has been a truly fantastic event, bringing together 75,000 
good-natured and enthusiastic revellers from all over the world to see 
in the bells in the heart of Scotland's capital.'

Joanna White and a group of friends travelled from Melbourne and Adelaide to experience the event.

She said: 'We love Hogmanay, we want to come back here every year. It's been awesome.'

Tens of thousands of people squeezed onto the Edinburgh streets for the Hogmanay celebrations

The fireworks in front of Edinburgh Castle were the culmination of celebrations

The spectacle involved thousands of fireworks set off from 45 locations spread around Edinburgh Castle and West Princes Street Gardens.

More than 20 tonnes of equipment and 7.5 miles of control cables and wires were used.

The festivities continued on New Year's Day in the capital with a dog sled race at Holyrood Park and a triathlon event.
