Serious questions: Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star Mama June has reportedly started dating convicted sex offender Mark McDaniel, the pair are pictured here in a hotel room last month

According to the registry Mark only got out of prison in March after he was convicted in 2004 of aggravated child molestation which is ‘when such person commits an offense of child molestation which act physically injures the child or involves an act of sodomy'.

TMZ reports that 34-year-old Mama June has been dating the convicted sex offender for the last few months, and the pair was pictured together in bed at a hotel room last month.

However, the reality star and her alleged boyfriend - who is 20 years her senior - were romantically involved with him at the time he was arrested. 

Horrifyingly TMZ claims Mark was convicted of assault one of June's own relatives. 

Just released: Mark was released from prison last month who was jailed for 10 years for molesting a child 'Mama' June Shannon knows

The website reports: 'Prosecutors say he molested an 8-year-old child - forcing oral sex.

'We're told Honey Boo Boo's mom has been seeing McDaniel for the last few months ... sneaking away from production of the show and meeting up with him. We're told she's also been setting him up by buying him various gifts.'

In light of the revelations, TLC said it is now examining whether the show will continue.

A representative told the MailOnline: 'TLC is not currently in production on HERE COMES HONEY BOO BOO. We are very concerned about this new information and are reassessing the future of the series.'

Serious charge: The 53-year-old, pictured here in mug shot believed to be from original arrest, was convicted of aggravated child molestation reportedly perpetrated against an eight-year-old

Registered: Mark's crime is public record on the Georgian sex offender registry, as part of his release requires him to keep authorities constantly updated on his whereabouts

TMZ contacted Mama June for comment but has yet to have a response.

The reality star does have a history of dating convicted criminals including her estranged partner David Michael 'Sugar Bear' Thompson - who is father of her youngest daughter and show star Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson.

In 1998, Sugar Bear was sentenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper.

In doubt: Mama June's show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo - which stars her daughter Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson - future is now being reassessed 

Recent split: Last month the reality matriarch and her partner on nine years, David Michael 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, revealed they had separated. The couple shared a televised commitment ceremony last year

The couple - who had a televised commitment ceremony last year after nine years together - only announced their split last month, but it is understood Mama June may have already been dating Mark at the time.

Tragically, this is not the only sex offender that Mama June has been linked to.

The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 17-year-old sister Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon, Michael Anthony Ford, 37, who dated her mother just a few months before she became pregnant, is currently behind bars.

Criminal past: In 1998, Sugar Bear was sentenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper

In 2008 he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet due to an offence committed in 2005.

According to prison documents, he was the charged with two more counts of sexual exploration of a child steaming from 2005 also, and is currently serving ten years for each charge. He is not expected to be released until 2026.

Here Comes Honey Boo Boo first aired in 2012 and was a spin off from TLC's Toddlers And Tiaras.

The show aired its Fourth Season finale in August and prior to the controversy there had been no announcement on whether it would be renewed.
