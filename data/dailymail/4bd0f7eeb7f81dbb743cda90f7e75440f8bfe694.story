A mother of two in South Carolina has been cuffed, hauled off to jail and charged with disorderly conduct after she allegedly yelled at her kids to 'stop squishing the f***ing bread' at a grocery store. 

Danielle Wolfe, 22, was arrested under a city ordinance in North Augusta, South Carolina, that makes it a crime, punishable by up to 30 days in jail,  to 'utter, while in a state of anger, in the presence of another, any bawdy, lewd or obscene words or epithets.'

Another shopper called police to the Kroger store in North Augusta about 10pm on Sunday to report that Ms Wolfe was swearing at her children in public.

Ms Wolfe denies swearing at her children - and instead said she was swearing at her husband

The woman told Officer Travis Smith that she approached Ms Wolfe and asked her to stop using foul language toward her children - and Ms Wolfe responded by turning the foul language toward her.

 When Officer Smith asked whether the woman would testify against Ms Wolfe in court, she said she would. 

Officer Smith then questioned Ms Wolfe, who admitted to using foul language, according to a police report. 

'He was like, "You're under arrest." Right in front of kids, in front of my husband, in front of customers,' Ms Wolfe told WJBF-TV.

She says the woman who called police told her that she was having a bad day. 

'So, because you're having a bad day you're going to ruin somebody's life,' Ms Wolfe told WJBF.

The other shopper later apologized to Ms Wolfe for calling the police. She said the bad language gave her a flashback to her childhood, when she was abused by her parents

North Augustus police Lieutenant Tim Thornton said it's uncommon for officers to arrest people under the disorderly conduct ordinance, but in this case 'we have a definite law that's been violated, city code. And we had a witness and a confession.'

He added: 'You can't go someplace in public and use that kind of language in the state of South Carolina.'
