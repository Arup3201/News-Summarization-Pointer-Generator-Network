Customers could end up paying more for phone contracts over the next year or so as a direct result of Ofcom increasing the amount it charges operators to rent radio spectrum.

Plans unveiled by the telecoms industry regulator reveal it intends to increase rental fees by more than 400 per cent in some cases, to bring the prices in line with the market value in other countries.

Mobile operators have slammed the plans as 'disappointing' and 'excessive' and such increases could see operators raising the price for phones, calls, data and monthly contracts to claw back some of this extra money.

Ofcom's price increases will vary depending on how much radio spectrum each operator uses. Vodafone and O2 will each pay £83.1m a year - a 433% rise, while EE and Three's are set to increase by 330% to £107.1m and £35.7m respectively. These rises could be filtered to customers, but no official announcement has been made

The price increases will vary depending on how much radio spectrum each operator uses.

Vodafone and O2 will each pay £83.1 million a
year - a rise of 433 per cent up from £15.6 million.

EE and Three's rent
is set to increase by 330 per cent.

This will put EE's new fee at £107.1 million, up from £24.9m.

Three's will rise to £35.7 million, up from 
£24.9m.

Operators currently pay around £64.5 million in total for using the 
900 megahertz and 1800 megahertz spectrum bands.

The proposed changes are set to increase this total to around £309 million.

Earlier this year, the government raised just £2.34 billion during the 4G spectrum auction - it had hoped to raise £3.5 billion.

The price rises are set to give the Treasury an extra £245 million-a-year.

The proposals come after Britain raised a less-than-expected £2.34 billion ($3.7 
billion) during the 4G spectrum auction earlier this year- it had hoped to raise £3.5 billion.

Currently Vodafone, Telefonica's O2, EE and Hutchison's H3G (that runs the Three network) pay around £64.5 million in total for using the 900 megahertz and 1800 megahertz spectrum bands.

The proposed changes are set to increase this total to around £309 million.

'Spectrum is a valuable and finite national resource, and charging for it can incentivise the optimal use of frequencies,' Ofcom said in a statement.

The British government asked Ofcom to recalculate the fees to reflect 'full market value' and Ofcom said the new rules were expected to take effect next year after a consultation period that ends in December.

Operators had expected a price rise but Vodafone said it was disappointed by the scale of the increase. It said it was reviewing the details of Ofcom's proposals before responding to the regulator.

This chart shows the results of Ofcom's 4G auction, in which parts of the spectrum were bid for by operators. Earlier this year the government raised £2.34 billion during this auction, yet had a target of £3.5 billion.

'We are however disappointed that Ofcom is proposing a 430 percent increase in the fees we pay for our existing spectrum at a time when we are investing more than ever in vital national digital infrastructure,' a spokesman said in a statement.

'The regulator should be encouraging such private sector investment in infrastructure and new services like 4G, which will benefit consumers, businesses and the wider British economy for many years to come.'

An EE spokesman told MailOnline: 'The proposed increase in licence fees is 
excessive at a time when the industry needs to invest heavily in the roll out of 4G.

'There must be a balance between licence fees and the
critical 4G network investment consumers and businesses are demanding 
to drive growth and jobs for the UK economy.'

Other operators are yet to respond.

'Our concern is that it will be mobile users who are left to foot the bill - and it isn’t clear if there will be any direct benefits to them,' added Adam Kirby, telecoms expert at uSwitch.com.

'In fact, providers will no doubt be concerned that their investment in network infrastructure will be limited if they are shelling out more for licence fees.

'No increases [for consumers] have been confirmed as yet - Ofcom are now consulting on the fees. It remains to be seen how much these costs will actually rise, and if the networks can fight back and keep a lid on these increases.'
