Disgusted commuters have taken to social media to shame fellow passengers who cross the line when it comes to acceptable behaviour on public transport.

Instead of picking up a book or a newspaper to survive a long commute, these shamed travellers are taking up everything from personal grooming to exposing their breasts on the train to pass the time.

Using #cityfail, disgusted and frustrated commuters have taken to Twitter and Facebook to expose public transport faux pas.

Disgusted commuters have taken to social media to shame fellow passengers who cross the line when it comes to acceptable behaviour on public transport, like this man shaving his head

Taking multi-tasking to a whole new level, one man is seen making good use of his commute by shaving his head with an electric razor, while reading something on his lap.

In another social media photo, a woman appears to be performing her own breast examination with her top pulled up over her ample chest in the comfort of her seat.

While one train commuter made a new friend on board by falling asleep on her shoulder. 

One woman complained about leg space on the train, posting a photo on Twitter of the uncomfortable seating arrangement she had with the man sitting across from her.

'The most awkward of all train interactions my legs inside his spread legs. Ewww. Keep your knees together #cityfail,' Brigitta Ryan wrote.

But these City Rail fails do not just end with passengers.

Some social media users took aim at the train operator.

At Rhodes station, Sir *[FNAME]* pointed out the dangers of having an emergency exit chained and padlocked.

'I bet that releases easily,' he captioned the photo with sarcasm.

While R. Hobo vented their frustration about the two-month closure of the lifts at Platform 16 and 17 at Central Station.

'How ridiculous. Are you kidding me #cityrail!!!' he wrote.

In another photo, a late arrival gets their umbrella caught between the doors as the train pulls away. 

This passenger's umbrella looks like it is about to go for a ride without its tardy owner

While this commuter is not happy with an emergency exit being chained up and padlocked

While those arriving at platforms 16 and 17 at Central Station will not have lift access for almost two months
