Accused: Everett Donelson wants his daughter's alleged killer, Chester Leroy Todd (pictured), to walk free to deprive him of free medical care for his Parkinson's

The father of a woman who was raped and beaten to death 16 years ago says he does not want his daughter's alleged killer to be sent to jail - but would prefer to see him free on the streets to suffer with his crippling Parkinson's disease alone

Chester Leroy Todd, 66, from Denver, has been a fugitive since 1996 when a first-degree murder warrant was issued for him in the death of mother-of-three Sheri Majors, Denver Police spokesman Sonny Jackson said.

Everett Donelson says he would prefer to see authorities drop charges against the 66-year-old and let him go: 'They should just release him on the streets, in his own little walker,' he said.

'That would be a bigger punishment than being in jail where he can get free medical treatment.'

Todd is suffering from end-stage Parkinson's disease and Mr Donelson believes he only confessed to Sheri's murder to witnesses so he could make use of the free medical care he would receive behind bars.Â 

The 27-year-old woman's beaten and strangled body was found adjacent to railroad tracks in downtown Denver on March 17, 1996, a day after witnesses at a pool hall saw her accept a ride from Todd.

His abandoned tractor-trailer rig was discovered at a Sioux City, Iowa, truck stop days later.

Evidence recovered from the truck linked Todd to Majors' murder, police said.

In 2006, the FBI's Violent Criminal Apprehension Program issued a bulletin saying the agency was compiling a list of suspects in a series of rapes and murders of prostitutes who frequented truck stops in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, Indiana and Pennsylvania.

Todd was the only one named as a suspect in the crimes. His attorney pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder on Todd's behalf so he would not have to appear in court.

Last time he appeared he complained that sitting in his wheelchair made him 'uncomfortable'.

'Uncomfortable is hearing how he killed Sheri while she was begging for mercy,' her cousin Rhonda Gans, 40, told the Denver Post.

After being hospitalized in Las Vegas in February 2011, Todd confessed the murder to several witnesses.

Todd, who was homeless, had been living in Las Vegas and working at a produce warehouse under the alias James Diamond.In 2006, the FBI named Todd as a suspect in a series of killings and rapes of prostitutes at truck stops across the country.

A jury found him guilty of murder in 1967 in Illinois for the shotgun slaying of a man. He was released from prison in 1982.
