Suddenly it feels different. Speculation about Luis Suarez’s future is nothing new but this time, almost in the blink of an eye, his departure from Liverpool seems inevitable.

‘Why?’ you will ask. Liverpool, after all, have not been approached by any club in Europe about Suarez since Arsenal’s ham-fisted £40million plus £1 offer last July nor has he personally told Brendan Rodgers or members of Anfield’s hierarchy that he wants to leave.

Furthermore, the impression in the dressing room is that Suarez wants to give Liverpool 12 more months, to sample Champions League nights at Anfield and help the club attempt to go one place better after that remarkable pursuit of the Barclays Premier League trophy last season.VIDEO Scroll down to see Uruguay hero Suarez get serenaded by his team-mates

With Suarez, though, you can never relax and the last few days have proven that momentum is building.

Liverpool have done all they can to keep him, making the 27-year-old the highest paid player in their history when they offered him a new contract last December, but it seems as if the point has been reached where they can do no more.

If Suarez’s comments after he put England to the sword in Sao Paolo set alarm bells ringing, the flurry of stories in El Mundo Deportivo – the influential Barcelona-based newspaper – and words from his father-in-law Gustavo Balbi ('this is the right time for him to move,' he told Spanish TV show La Sexta) suggest this is a fight Liverpool cannot win.

They were outstanding 12 months ago when he tried to engineer a move to Arsenal. Brendan Rodgers handled a difficult situation with aplomb, while principal owner John W Henry stood up to player power and maintained unequivocally that Suarez wouldn’t get his way.

But what do they do this time? Today’s edition of El Mundo Deportivo reports that negotiations 'are about to begin with Liverpool for Suarez' to make him 'the stellar signing for Barcelona’s 2014/15 campaign'.

Liverpool have had no dialogue with Barcelona but the level of detail in the story includes reference to that Raul Sanllehi – a man who was influential Neymar’s last summer – will be instrumental if and when the time comes for negotiations to begin.

For the moment, however, all Liverpool can do is wait and see what unfolds. At face value, Suarez is still a Liverpool player representing his country at the World Cup but it is impossible to escape the feeling that, very soon, something will happen that will transform the situation.

Who knows? Something could even happen tonight. Suarez is bound to be asked a question if he stops in the Mixed Zone after Uruguay’s showdown with Italy in Natal and given how comfortable he feels speaking to his compatriots, that is where the key answer may be found.

Should that be the case, Liverpool will have no option but to act quickly and decisively. For all that Rodgers, Henry et al excelled in the face of last year’s saga, they could do without another one following them around and dominating the agenda once more.

July is going to be a busy enough month for Rodgers as it is, with friendlies to play in Copenhagen, Preston, Boston, Chicago, New York and then Charlotte and the last thing he will want is to be giving daily updates on Suarez’s future.

This time, if Barcelona do come calling, the key is to get the maximum they can out of the deal and have it concluded as swiftly as possible. They do not want to fall into the same trap as Tottenham did with Real Madrid and Gareth Bale and still be negotiating with deadline day looming.

Selling Suarez is not a decision that will be made easily. He is a sublime talent, comfortably keeps company with the top five in world football, and is blessed with that magical quality of being able to produce those moments of fantasy that others can only dream.

Those who have watched him at Anfield for the last three-and-a-half years will tell tales to their grandchildren in the years to come about the magic of the man from Salto who upheld the tradition of the club’s fabled No 7 shirt and almost made Liverpool champions.

For that reason, Liverpool will fight until the very end to keep Suarez on Merseyside. But the problem they have is the identity of the suitor.

When Barcelona and Real Madrid set their mind to acquiring a player, the chase only ends one way and Liverpool know this better than most, given what happened in the past with Javier Mascherano, Xabi Alonso and Steve McManaman.

Barcelona can pay Suarez a king’s ransom after losing high wage earners such as Carles Puyol, Cesc Fabregas and Victor Valdes – Xavi is also likely to leave – while they need to make a statement after seeing their bitter rivals Madrid win the Champions League last month.

The statement they want to make is Luis Suarez – and that is why it feels inevitable this story is heading for one conclusion.
