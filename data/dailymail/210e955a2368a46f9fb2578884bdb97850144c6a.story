Fin Rayner (pictured with her daughter Rhiannon), who left Kai the Shar-Pei tied up at a train station, has insisted she did nothing wrong

The woman who left Kai the Shar-Pei tied up outside a train station insists she did nothing wrong by abandoning the dog.

As the first picture of Fin Rayner, from Aberdeenshire, emerged, the 39-year-old mother claims she left the dog  behind after the sale of him fell through.

Ms Rayner claims she had arrived at Ayr train station planning to buy the dog for £400 after replying to an advert on listings website Gumtree.

But when she got to the station with her nine-year-old daughter Rhiannon Strachan, she found Kai - whose real name is Pluto - did not look like the dog in the advert.

The mother-of-three told the Daily Record: 'I went to buy a dog but the dog was not the same as the picture advertised.'

'The guy rushed out with a food chest and lead on the dog. But I could see there was something up because he was very skinny.

'I said I wanted to take the dog for a walk, so he asked me for £150 as a deposit in case I didn't come back. Then I saw him tearing off in his car. I phoned and said "You better come back for your dog". He never turned up.' 

She added: 'I got into the station and the dog wasn't settling. He was pulling on the lead and peeing everywhere.

'I thought that it wasn't my dog - I didn't want him.' 

The mother claims she then panicked as she had to get the last train to Aberdeen.

She phoned her son who told her the photograph in the advert was actually from a picture taken in the U.S. in 2005 - and not of the Scottish dog.

Ms Rayner said: 'I panicked. I suffer from a panic disorder so I panicked even more and thought I could have a stolen dog now.

'I spoke to a man at the station and told him that it wasn't my dog. I told the guy I needed to get the next train. So the guy knew and he said to tie him so I did.'

Miss Rayner said she has now decided not to buy another pet for her family after going through the ordeal at the weekend.

She said: 'He lied about the dog. I can't believe he did this.

'I've been shaken for days.

'I don't think people should sell dogs on Gumtree.'

Ms Rayner says she refused to buy Kai and left him at the station because he did not look like the dog in the Gumtree advert

 The dog was found with his only possessions - a case containing a toy, bowl, food and a pillow

After she left, Kai was spotted by a commuter who made sure he was passed on to the Scottish SPCA.

The dog was found with just his only possessions - a case containing a toy, bowl, food and a pillow. 

Police said they were not involved in the investigation yesterday. However, the  SPCA said it was keen to speak to the man who tried to sell the dog.

One of its inspectors, Stewart Taylor, said: ‘We have received information as to how Kai came to be found tied up at Ayr railway station.

‘This appears to have been a sale over the internet which has gone wrong and an example of the potential dangers of buying a pet online without knowing an animal’s background.

‘His sad story has touched the hearts of animal lovers all over the world and we have been overwhelmed with kind messages and offers of new homes.’

Jed found a home in Whitby, Yorkshire, after his plight was highlighted in the Mail

After spending almost seven years in kennels, Jed had probably given up on ever finding a loving home.

The lurcher, pictured, was taken in as a four-month-old puppy in 2007.

But he spent his next 50 dog years at the rescue centre in Darlington being overlooked by 17,000 potential suitors.

Then, just before Christmas – after his plight was highlighted in the Mail – a couple came forward. 

New owner Ian Woodcock, of Whitby, Yorkshire, said he now spends his days going for walks on the moors, sleeping by the fire and playing with his new toys.

After pictures of Kai were tweeted by the animal charity, hundreds of dog-lovers from Britain, the U.S., Canada, Spain and even the Philippines offered to re-home him. 

Assistant manager of the SPCA Katrina Cavanagh said: 'We've had offers from America, the Philippines, Canada and England and we're trying to work our way through them.

'We've had good responses in the past but this is off the scale. We've never had offers from the other side of the world before.

'What we're saying to people is fill out a questionnaire, and Anna the manager and I will have a wee look through, whittle them down and make a decision. It'll be hard but we'll get there.

'We just can't believe how big this became, but then, it's not every day you get a dog abandoned with his own suitcase.'

Kai has been compared to Paddington bear after his ordeal, which has prompted an investigation by the animal welfare charity.

Until it is complete, he will not be handed over to a new family, so it could be some time before he is adopted.
