In his role as the BBC’s business editor, he does not usually have his emotions  on show.

But Robert Peston has laid bare in heart-wrenching detail his grief at the death of his wife last year, revealing how he transcribed the handwritten manuscript of her last novel so that he could ‘keep talking to her’.

In an article for Radio Times Mr Peston has written candidly of the love he felt for his wife and how his family tried to deal with the effects of her battle with lung cancer.

Describing author Siân Busby, with whom he first became friends as a teenager, as ‘the woman I loved for most of my conscious life’, he praised the bravery and stoicism she showed in dealing with the illness.

Tragic death: Peston's wife Siân Busby died from lung cancer in August last year aged just 51

Mr Peston, 53, said that through the ‘sheer force of her will’ his wife had remained ‘poised and beautiful’ despite the ‘relentless’ treatment and ‘terrible shocks and emergencies’ that came with the disease.

He said his wife had worked on the book, A Commonplace Killing, until her illness had become ‘excruciating and wholly incapacitating’.

He revealed that he did not know the work had been completed until he started reading her ‘handwriting as familiar as my own’ on the page and ‘hearing her voice in my head’. He described it as an ‘exquisite work’ which was ‘more-or-less perfect’.

Set in 1946, the book has been described as a gripping murder story which highlights a ‘post-war world of disillusionment, bitterness and emotional disturbance’.

Mr Peston began to transcribe it a few days after his wife died last September at the age of 51. It will be published on Thursday.

He said: ‘My motive was selfish: I wanted to keep talking to her. I still do. The tears could not be staunched as I read, deciphered and typed.’

He added: ‘Here she was, all hope lost of reprieve from the lethal cancer, reflecting on what it is like to know that death awaits on the morrow.’ When he read the manuscript, he marvelled ‘at her victory over devastating circumstance’.

Mr Peston said that while the book was a ‘jewel’ in its own right, the fact that Miss Busby wrote it after receiving her ‘death sentence’ made it even more precious to him.

He recalled movingly how, last August, a consultant oncologist revealed that nothing more could be done to help his wife other than ‘take the edge off’ her suffering.

He said: ‘It was almost exactly five years to the day after Siân – who is probably the only person I know who has never smoked a cigarette – was diagnosed with lung cancer. In the ensuing years, she never despaired or resorted to self-pity, even as the cancer spread.

‘The cycle of surgery, body-racking chemicals and radiation was relentless. Life became punctuated by terrible shocks and emergencies. Yet those who met her at pretty much any point in this ordeal encountered the Siân they had always known: solicitous, supportive, witty, insightful, unselfish.’

Mr Peston said the priority was that their two boys – Max, the son he had with Miss Busby, and Simon, her son from her first marriage – were not continually being asked about their mother’s health, and that his wife ‘just got on with living’.

In fact, Mr Peston said, there were ‘wonderful years’ earlier in her illness when the disease did not ‘haunt’ them but made them focus on the important things, such as family, work, ‘friends, beauty and fun’.

But he admitted that once his wife had got to the point of finishing her final novel, the cancer was more like ‘a monster laying waste to our family’.

He said: ‘Siân was being turned into an invalid, in almost unimaginable pain most of the time. For her, what was perhaps worse was that she was being robbed of her ability to take care of those she loved.’

But he said there had been ‘an almost moral imperative not to be ground down by circumstances, even if those circumstances are an express train thundering in our direction’.

In the article he talked about letters he had kept which she had sent him when they were studying at university more than 30 years ago, and when they were ‘too-briefly a couple’ before they were apart for 12 years. They rekindled their relationship after her first marriage ended.

The Radio Times piece includes a letter from his ‘beautiful’ wife – who was a schoolfriend of Mr Peston’s sister – written when she was 18. Mr Peston said: ‘She was the most brilliant, caring, humane and loving person I have met. And funny. I miss her all the time.’
