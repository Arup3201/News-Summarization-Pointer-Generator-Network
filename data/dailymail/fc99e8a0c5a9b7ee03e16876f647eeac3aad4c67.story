Frost is on the way and tender plants are exhausted. It's time to clear the wreckage and hunker down for winter. But this is not the end.

The new gardening year starts now — if you want gorgeous beds and containers for Easter, you need to plant them as soon as possible.

Unlike summer planting, colour won't be instant, but that will make the flowers even more welcome when they do appear. If you visit a garden centre this weekend, you may be disappointed at the lack of colour, but don't be put you off.

Tiptoe through the tulips: The spectacular spring display at Great Dixter, East Sussex 

See if you can find forget-me-nots, wallflowers, spring daisies or primulas — all low-key now, but full of promise.

Bulbs look even less exciting, but there will be masses on sale, from tiny scillas to huge crown imperials.

SLOW BURNERS

Winter containers and beds are a slow burn. They look green and unexciting during the darkest months, but colour will appear gradually.

Wallflowers are brilliant for that. If planting them in pots with tulips, choose compact varieties such as Prince Mix.

For larger beds, plant tall ones such as dark-red Vulcan or Thompson & Morgan's Most Scented mix.

Forget-me-nots are essential. If you allowed them to naturalise last year, there should be self-sown plants begging to be transplanted to your containers.

They will create an intense blue mist in April and blend beautifully with tulips. Choose primroses carefully. Modern ones can be garish, but older primulas, such as dark-leaved, lilac-flowered Guinevere, look wonderful in pots.

Oxlips also thrive in containers, and flower from March to May. Team them with grape hyacinths or tulips.

BAGS OF BULBS 

Bulbs are the backbone of spring displays. You can use big ones such as hyacinths to make bold splashes of colour or dot little ones among other plants to extend the interest.

Though fine on their own, bulbs look better among leafy plants. And since they can be removed after blooming, you can plant for a succession of flowers from midwinter to May.

Snowdrops and varieties of Iris reticulata flower from early February and can precede crocuses or muscari.

But tulips are the top bulbs for the spring climax. If they are to grow on their own, choose short-stemmed ones, such as tan orange Prinses Irene and double-flowered Eternal Flame.

Team taller kinds — such as scarlet Apeldoorn, soft-pink Valentine or two-tone Tequila Sunrise — with forget-me-nots or harmonising wallflowers. Big daffodils may be too lanky for containers, but the compact narcissus varieties do magnificently.

Try pale yellow, late-flowering Hawera with winter pansies, or dot white-and-lemon Jack Snipe among the primulas.

Bulbs are some of a gardener's best purchases. After using them for bedding displays or containers, you can then replant them elsewhere in your garden.

Then, with no more effort, they'll give you years of service. That surely makes them the best possible bargains among spring flowers.
