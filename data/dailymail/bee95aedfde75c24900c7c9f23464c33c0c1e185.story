Alan Irvine will explore the possibility of luring ‘Rolls Royce’ Jack Rodwell to West Bromwich Albion once he lands Joleon Lescott.

Irvine worked with Rodwell at Everton and wants to tap into his football contacts to attract bigger names to the Hawthorns.

Lescott is expected to sign for Albion after he undertook a medical at the club yesterday and Irvine wants at least five more quality players to strengthen his threadbare squad.

Rodwell moved to Manchester City in 2012 for an initial £12million after progressing through Everton's academy but has been troubled by injury and only made 26 appearances for the club.

‘I know Jack really well as I live in Southport,’ he said.

‘He's had some injury problems but is a very good player. He was a Rolls Royce as a kid but I don't know his situation.

‘Manchester City bought him for a huge amount of money so I can't imagine he would be someone available for a small fee.'

Irvine admitted that bringing in high-calibre players on loan could provide a solution but said such deals would be completed towards the end of the window.

‘What you tend to find is loans happen later,' he said.

'Let's put everyone in together in pre-season and see what happens in terms of the squad.

‘I certainly think getting loan players in is a way of strengthening the squad but we cannot wait until that situation happens as we have too small a squad.’
