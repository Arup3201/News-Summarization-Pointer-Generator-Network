Rachel Munger gave her husband Dale the surprise of his life - and recorded it for the world to see.

Instead of simply breaking the news of her pregnancy over dinner, Rachel opted for something far more innovative.

She crafted a small care package - in an orange box - full of hints about her good news.

Rachel Munger came up with an innovative way to tell her husband that she was expecting their first child

'I've got a surprise,' Rachel tells her husband.

'Is this going on Youtube?' he questions as he begins to open the box.

Dale laughs as he pulls out a cartoon picture of a family - before discovering the tiny pair of black and white shoes hidden at the bottom of the package.

The Army engineer's reaction immediately turns to stunned shock.

As he pulls out a pair of tiny trainers, the realisation dawns - and his reaction is positively priceless

'Are you pregnant?' he questions several times.

While his eager excitement over the potential news is sweet - it's his reaction once his wife confirms the new that is truly priceless.

'He was REALLY excited,' Rachel wrote online.

The couple, who live in Anchorage, Alaska, welcomed their first daughter on November 1, 2014.
