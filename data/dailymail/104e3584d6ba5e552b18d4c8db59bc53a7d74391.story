It is called Mount Pleasant estate – but the name could not be further from the reality of those who  have to live here.

For this sprawling, dilapidated industrial park in a deprived corner of London was not built for human habitation.

But the rat-infested warren of crumbling Victorian buildings is home to desperate people living in makeshift lodgings that even they describe as 'like living in a ghetto'.

The illegal 'hidden homes' are unfit for purpose, with whole families, mainly immigrants, cramped into tiny rooms without heating or proper sanitation

It is part of a worrying new phenomenon in London and the Home Counties, whereby commercial buildings, such as warehouses, factories, offices and garages, are shoddily converted and rented out as residential lets.

These illegal ‘hidden homes’ are unfit for purpose, with whole families, mainly immigrants, cramped into tiny rooms without heating or proper sanitation.

They are unregulated, unsafe and, as a result of being poorly wired for electricity, have caused more than 30 fires in the past nine months, which claimed two lives.

London Fire Brigade has warned of the dangers while councils struggle to cope with their emergence.

The situation in Mount Pleasant, in the North-West London borough of  Brent, only came to light when the emergency services responded to a small fire and found up to 100 people living in appalling conditions.

Most have now been evicted but around 30 – mostly immigrants from Eastern Europe or Asia – remain, with just one bathroom and mould-covered kitchen, between all of them.

Other authorities with the problem include Slough, in Berkshire, Newham in East London and Ealing in West London

One 28-year-old Indian man, who did not want to reveal his real name for fear of reprisals, has lived there for 18 months and pays £600 a month in rent.

His only heat is from a gas hob ring and light from a torch or candle. He said: ‘It is like a ghetto.’

Unemployed Romanian handyman Peter and girlfriend Anya, both 25, share a tiny room for £400 a month and also have no power or heating.

Samir Fertal, 38, who owns a garage on the estate, said he was fighting a constant battle against rats and rubbish.

Other authorities with the problem include Slough, in Berkshire, Newham in East London and Ealing in West London.

Many of the buildings have been sub-let many times with rent being paid in cash, making it difficult to trace who is accountable.

Landlords who are found often exploit a loophole by claiming they are renting to relatives.

Last month Harrow Council, in North-West London, chartered a plane with thermal imaging, uncovering four times more ‘suspicious’ outbuildings than expected.

Housing minister Kris Hopkins said £6million had been made available to local authorities to ‘root out the cowboys’ and 950 illegal and overcrowded commercial properties had been uncovered as a result.
