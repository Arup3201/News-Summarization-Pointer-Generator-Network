The mysterious murder of a prominent Harvard educated Florida law professor in his home took a worrying turn on Monday when police announced that Dan Markel was the victim of an 'assassination'.

Tallahassee police said that killing of Professor Markel, 41, who was shot in the head at his home on Friday, was not a random act of violence - rather he was the intended target of an attack.

Markel, 41, who is divorced from the mother of his two children, died one day after the attack in his upscale Tallahassee neighborhood, as police revealed there were no signs of burglary or robbery and police have admitted they have no suspects so far.

Intentional? Police are investigating the possibility that Dan Markel was the subject of a targeted killing inside his Tallahassee home on Friday morning

Devoted: Professor Dan Markel with his two sons, age five and three, was known as a proud father with shared custody despite his divorce from his wife, Wendi, last year. Friends and colleagues have raised $50,000 for his sons

Discovered: The Harvard and Cambridge educated professor was found with a gunshot wound to his head on Friday morning after neighbors called the police upon hearing a loud bang

'This is a puzzle and we need to get all of the pieces of the puzzle put together to bring this case to a close,' said Officer David Northway.

Officers were first called to Markel's home at 11am on Friday after a neighbor reported hearing a loud bang coming from his home.

He was found with a gunshot wound to his head, but died later in hospital from his injuries.

'It was not a robbery,' Northway said. 'It does not appear that it was a burglary. At this time, it does appear that Mr. Markel was unfortunately the intended victim in this case.'

Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father

Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013

Markel was known as a strict disciplinary at Florida State University where he taught law and was known across the country for his writing featured in the New York Times and the Atlantic.

Markel, a Toronto native, had just published a theory of retributive justice in the United States that applied elements of mercy, capital punishment, damages and shaming.

He was the co-author of the book, 'Privilege or Punish: Criminal Justice and the Challenge of Family Ties' and he founded the popular law website, PrawfsBlawg.

Markel, the father of two young boys, ages 3 and 5, is divorced from fellow FSU law professor Wendi Adelson.

Her attorney, Jimmy Judkins, said that Adelson is cooperating with police and he told USA Today she is 'distraught, devastated, scared to death.'

Adelson, 35, currently is the director of Florida State University's Public Interest Law Center.

Police have admitted that the Harvard and Cambridge educated professor's death has left them mystified.

They are still working to find any witnesses who may be able to shed any light on the troubling case.

'The initial investigation has provided no indication that this case is connected to a burglary or robbery, and investigators are assuring residents there is no evidence this was a random act,' said the Tallahassee Police Department in a statement on Monday.

'Neighbourhood residents should continue to be vigilant, but it appears at this time that Mr. Markel was the intended victim in this incident.'

Judkins said that the uncertainty was causing Adelson to become frightened.

'She’s devastated by it,' said Jimmy Judkins, her lawyer to The Globe and Mail.

'She’s a basket case over the plight of her children now. She’s scared because she doesn’t know who did this or why it occurred and it’s got her thinking the worst in so many different ways.'

Markel and his wife split two years ago and their divorce became final on July 31 last year.

They were currently involved in a legal dispute regarding their finances and custody issues.

Judkins said Professor Adelson is co-operating with police and is not considered a suspect.

A post on PrawfsBlawg was dedicated to Markel.

Murdered: The 41-year-old had no enemies according to his friends who have been left bewildered and scared by their friends death

'What we have in common, with many others, is Dan,' the post read.

'His network of friends and loved ones — and he had a great deal of love for all his many friends, as we did and do for him — is enormous.

'His boundless energy was at the center of this community; it made it run, it gave it life.'

His friend and colleague, Stepehen Valdeck of the American University said that Markel's 'devotion to scholarly enterprise' was his key.

Vladeck said that 'Dan was  brilliant scholar and writer, but there are lots of law professors who fit those labels,' Vladeck wrote in an email to FoxNews.com.

'Whether that meant tirelessly reading and providing feedback on his friends' paper, organizing conferences where folks could present their ideas, or starting a blog where folks looking for an outlet could find a forum to develop and distribute their ideas, Dan cared about legal ideas, as such — even those that weren't his own.'

Markel's own attorney said that it is physically beyond him to imagine how this has happened.

'He’s … by all accounts one of the most dedicated fathers anybody has ever known. And for this to happen to him, it’s just beyond repugnant,' said Stephen Webster, Professor Markel’s lawyer to The Globe and Mail.

And the respected scholar's friends were equally distraught.

'It doesn’t make sense on any level. But at least the initial theory was that it was some kind of robbery gone wrong, which is awful, but at least makes sense,' said Michael McCann, a friend who teaches law at the University of New Hampshire.

'This has become a story that no longer makes sense. If, in fact, he was somehow targeted, I literally just cannot understand that.'
