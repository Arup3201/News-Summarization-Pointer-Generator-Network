Australia and Canada have invited the UK to join an alliance of ‘like-minded’ nations to limit action on climate change.

The two countries have each rolled back green policies in recent months, and want others to join them to resist a legally-binding international deal on carbon emissions.

Tony Abbott, Australia’s prime minister, called for limited action on climate change that would not ‘clobber the economy’.

He is seeking to form a conservative 
alliance that aims to undermine what he calls a ‘left-liberal’ push by 
US President Barack Obama to ramp up green taxes.

Like
 Canada’s prime minister Stephen Harper, who withdrew his nation from 
the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, Mr Abbott has moved to repeal 
Australia’s carbon tax.

The
 British Government last night distanced itself from the 
Canadian-Australian alliance, insisting it had not been approached and 
was, in fact, ‘leading from the front’ on climate change.

Mr
 Abbott, standing alongside the Canadian leader during a visit to 
Ottawa, said: ‘We think that climate change is a significant problem, 
it’s not the only or even the most important problem the world faces but
 it is a significant problem and it’s important every country should 
take the action that it thinks is best to address emissions.’

He
 said no country would ever take action that would harm its economy, 
adding ‘we are just a bit more frank about that than other countries’.

‘It’s not that we don’t seek to deal with climate change,’ he said.

‘We seek to deal with it in a way that enhances our ability to create jobs and growth, this is their position.’ 

He said efforts are underway to form a new ‘centre-right’ alliance including Britain, as well as India and New Zealand.

Climate
 change is due to move up the political agenda in the coming months, 
with a United Nations summit on climate action planned for September, to
 be hosted by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

It
 will lay the groundwork for a legally-binding global deal on reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, to be agreed in Paris in December 2015.

Mr
 Obama, who sees strong action to stop climate change as a legacy issue 
as his presidency draws to a close, last week announced plans to cut 
pollution from power plants by 30 per cent by 2030.

The
 British Government, meanwhile, has gathered an anti-green reputation in
 recent months, after David Cameron reportedly told his officials to get
 rid of the ‘green c**p, his party promised to cap the number of onshore
 wind turbines, and officials slashed subsidies for large solar farms.

But officials last night insisted the UK was not aware of the anti-climate grouping and had not been approached about joining.

A
 spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘The UK
 Government remains fully committed to domestic and international 
actions to curb climate change, and will continue to advocate strong 
actions through the UN process and other international forums, working 
with our inter-national partners.

‘The UK is leading from the front in the fight against climate change.

‘We
 are pushing for an ambitious EU energy and climate change package that 
will lead to a 40 per cent domestic reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030, and we are also working to secure an ambitious 
legally binding global climate agreement in Paris in 2015.’

Bob
 Ward, policy at the London School of Economics Grantham Research 
Institute on Climate Change, said: ‘This looks like a desperate move by 
Tony Abbott who must be beginning to realise how isolated Australia and 
Canada are as China, the United States, Europe and the rest of the world
 move towards stronger action on climate change.

‘The
 Australian and Canadian governments, through their backsliding on 
commitments to cut green-house gas emissions, are making their countries
 synonymous with old and dirty methods of energy production, frantically
 trying to resist progress towards clean and more efficient sources.

‘I
 doubt very much that Mr Cameron or any other world leader will join 
Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Harper in what is, in effect, 
the slow lane, where their countries will be eventually overtaken by 
those that are making the transition to clean and sustainable economic 
growth.’
