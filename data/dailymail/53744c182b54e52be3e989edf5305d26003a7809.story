Underground tanks that hold a mix of
 toxic radioactive waste at America's most contaminated nuclear site 
pose a possible risk of explosion.

A nuclear safety board made the announcement in 
advance of confirmation hearings for the next leader of the Energy Department.

State and federal officials have long
 known that hydrogen gas could build up inside the tanks at the Hanford 
Nuclear Reservation, leading to an explosion that would release 
radioactive material.

The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety
 Board recommended additional monitoring and ventilation of the tanks 
last fall, and federal officials were working to develop a plan to 
implement the recommendation.

The 'tank farm' to store nuclear waste on the Hanford nuclear reservation was built in 1944

The board expressed those concerns 
again Monday to U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, who is chairman of the Senate 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee and had sought the board's 
perspective about cleanup at Hanford.

The federal government created Hanford in the 1940s as part of the secret Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb.

It spends billions of dollars to 
clean up the 586-square-mile (1518-square-kilometer) site neighboring 
the Columbia River, the southern border between Washington and Oregon 
and the Pacific Northwest's largest waterway.

Federal officials have said six 
underground tanks at the site are leaking into the soil, threatening the
 groundwater, and technical problems have delayed construction of a 
plant to treat the waste for long-term safe disposal.

Those issues are likely to come up during confirmation hearings next week for Energy Secretary-nominee Ernest J. Moniz.

The fears of explosion and 
contamination could give Washington and Oregon officials more clout as 
they push for cleanup of the World War II-era site.

Central to the cleanup is the removal
 of 56 million gallons (212 million liters) of highly radioactive, toxic
 waste left from plutonium production from underground tanks.

Many of the site's single-shell 
tanks, which have just one wall, have leaked in the past, and state and 
federal officials announced in February that six such tanks are leaking anew.

Tanks on the site were put in place in the 1940s but are long past their 20-year life span

The nuclear safety board warned about
 the risk of explosion to Wyden, who wanted comment on the safety and 
operation of Hanford's tanks, technical issues that have been raised 
about the design of a plant to treat the waste in those tanks, and 
Hanford's overall safety culture.

In addition to the leaks, the board 
noted concerns about the potential for hydrogen gas buildup within a 
tank, in particular those with a double wall, which contain deadly waste
 that was previously pumped out of the leaking single-shell tanks.

'All the double-shell tanks contain 
waste that continuously generates some flammable gas,' the board said. 
'This gas will eventually reach flammable conditions if adequate 
ventilation is not provided.'

All of the tanks are actively 
ventilated, which means they have blowers and fans to prevent a buildup 
of hydrogen gas, and those systems are monitored to ensure they are 
operating as intended, Energy Department spokeswoman Carrie Meyer said.

'DOE is absolutely committed to ensuring the safety of Hanford's underground tanks,' Meyer said.

The U.S. government spends about $2 
billion annually on Hanford cleanup - roughly one-third of its entire 
budget for nuclear cleanup nationally
