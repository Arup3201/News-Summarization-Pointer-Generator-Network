Bayern Munich defender Holger Badstuber made his long-awaited comeback from injury in his side’s 3-0 friendly win over a fan club team on Friday.

Badstuber tore the cruciate ligament in his right knee in a 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund in December 2012, and then suffered a second tear as he made his comeback.

Badstuber led Bayern out as captain in the game against Red Baroons Dietmannsried in his Memmingen birthplace, and completed 58 minutes of the side’s first game of the new season.

It was 594 days since the first injury. Badstuber had returned from a torn thigh muscle only 11 days before that.
