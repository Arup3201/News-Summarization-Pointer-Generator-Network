Everton have completed the signing of Chelsea winger Christian Atsu on a season-long loan deal. 

The 22-year-old revealed that he had passed his medical on Wednesday evening and posted an image of himself meeting manager Roberto Martinez.

The club then confirmed that a deal had been finalised to make Atsu the Toffees' fifth signing of the summer, following the arrivals of Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry, Muhamed Besic and Brendan Galloway.

Atsu, who spent last season on loan at Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem, told evertontv: 'I'm very happy to be joining Everton because it's a great club, which likes to play football, and it's a great pleasure to be here.

'Playing in the Premier League has always been a dream for me and I have achieved that dream.

'This is the biggest level for me to play at. I know that it's a very competitive league and I believe with hard work we're going to be successful this season.'

Martinez added: 'He's a player who fits in with the culture and the way we want to play. He's a very gifted technical footballer and he's got the right personality and character to fit in with the group, which is vital.

'He will excite fans because he brings something completely different and a different way of playing to what we've got in the squad.

'He's a left-footed player who loves taking people on and he's got a really good understanding of the game for such a young man.

'He also brings extra competition in a position in which we felt we needed a player full of desire and hunger, who really wants to make things happen in the final third of the pitch.'
