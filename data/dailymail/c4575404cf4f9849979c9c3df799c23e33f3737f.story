The husband of one of the cruel lesbians who tortured a 67-year-old pensioner to death has described how his former wife became a violent drug addict.

Karl Siirak, the ex-husband of Kelly Barnes who was convicted of murdering Barry Reeve with her lesbian lover Jodie Barnes, says he watched his wife become cruel and desperate to feed her addiction for drugs.

Mr Siirak says he is sickened by the pair's brutality after they punched, stamped and slashed Mr Reeve with a knife, leaving the helpless pensioner dying for up to 48 hours.

The heartless couple, from Norwich, even
returned to his home after visiting the bank machine, stealing 
valuables and emptying his freezer.

Kelly, 32, and Jodie, 31, who had both 
denied murder have been given life imprisonment, with an order to each 
serve a minimum term of 24 years.

Barry Reeve lay dying for up to 48 hours after the attack

Mr Siirak, from Barry, South Wales, told The Mirror how he met Kelly in 1997, when she moved into the property beneath him.

He described how they fell in love, married in 1999 and had four children together, saying their lives were the picture of domestic bliss .

But their happiness soured when the 
security guard noticed his wife suffered extreme mood swings, and became
a vicious, volatile woman.

He told The Mirror: 'She was no longer 
the woman I'd wed and had become this paranoid, violent person who'd 
lash out at any moment.'

The pair divorced in 2005 with Kelly 
having custody over the children, and Mr Siirak said he heard rumours 
that Kelly was in sexual relationships with men and women.

He said she began experimenting with drugs and met Jodie, who she wed in a civil partnership ceremony in 2010.

Mr Siirak claims that Kelly became 
'horrendous' as she and Jodie clung together in a volatile relationship,
both addicted to drugs.

He claims that at one point they were so poor the pair lived in a tent with the four children for two months.

He said: 'After they'd sold everything 
in the house for drugs, they started selling the children's toys – 
that’s how low they stooped.'

The father claims he was powerless to 
intervene because Jodie dominated Kelly, so if he interfered he would 
not have access to his children.

Victim Barry Reeve told the pair he didn't have any money

When he heard about the murder case, he said he was devastated and offered his condolances to Mr Reeve's mourning family.

He said: 'I can't get my head around how
that sweet 17-year-old girl I met all that time ago could get involved 
in something so evil.'

The pair were caught on CCTV pictures 
trying to withdraw their victim's life-savings from a cash machine, 
attempting on several occasions to enter Mr Reeve's pin number.

The
court heard how the couple even returned to his home after visiting the
bank machine, stealing valuables and emptying his freezer.

Members of Mr Reeve's family wept as the verdict was delivered at Norwich Crown Court on Thursday.

A statement released by Mr Reeve's children said they 'could not be happier with the verdict'.

It added: 'As a family we were deeply shocked and distressed by what happened and 
the consequences for both of us, his son and daughter and his 
grandchildren.

'Our family could not be happier with the verdict, however, no amount of
time these women spend in prison will change what happened and bring 
back our lovely little dad.

'The whole court process has been a very emotional time, however, we 
look upon this as closure and now need to concentrate on our grieving 
and learning to live our lives without Dad whilst trying to come to 
terms with the awful circumstances in which he was taken from us.'

Callous: The pair were convicted of murdering the retired bus conductor. After visiting the cash machine they returned to his home and stole valuables

Jodie Barnes, formerly Ramsbottom, who
claimed during the trial that 'God had forgiven her', clutched a Bible 
and looked stunned.

Kelly Barnes shook her head and looked towards her partner.

As sentence was passed, Jodie Barnes shouted: 'I didn't lie, I swore on the Bible.'

Jailing them for life, Judge Peter Jacobs said: 'The man who you killed was frail, old and vulnerable and lived on his own.

'It
was a grotesque situation that he was lying there slowly dying and you 
were going around his property, stepping over and around his body and 
stealing his property.

'Survival was impossible, death was inevitable.

'You took away just about anything of value that he had.'

Norfolk Police found a bag that contained Barry Reeve's wallet. The pair who killed him returned to the scene to collect food they had taken from his freezer

Mr
Jacobs added that after their arrests the couple were still 'an item' 
and only began to blame one another when the weight of evidence against 
them became clear.

He said Mr Reeve's 'mental and 
physical suffering' aggravated the crime and added: 'You were totally 
indifferent as to whether he lived or died.'

During the trial mother-of-four Kelly 
admitted that they both visited Mr Reeve on February 9 last year after 
Jodie suggested that he might lend them or give them cash.

But
she told a jury that she had nothing to do with harming him and she 
claimed she did not see Jodie assaulting him at his home in Norwich, 
Norfolk.

Kelly claimed that 
Jodie only confessed to her what she had done to Mr Reeve when they met 
up in the gym at a women’s prison in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

Police recovered retired bus conductor Barry Reeve's wallet, after the pensioner was found in his home

Evidence: Mr Reeve's blood was found on a pair of jogging bottoms worn by Jodie

Kelly
told the jury that Jodie had told her before they visited Mr Reeve that
she had got to know the pensioner through her sister and he had 
previously given her money.

She
admitted she was ‘staggering and light-headed’ when they went to his 
bungalow as she had taken drugs including heroin and had been drinking.

When
the pensioner said he didn't have money to lend to the pair, Kelly 
admitted searching the living room for objects to steal and then did the
same in Mr Reeve’s bedroom.

The pensioner's body was found in his blood splattered home two weeks later after he had died of serious head injuries. He had also developed pneumonia.

Mr Reeve lived off a pension and benefits but had been heard talking about having large sums of money, once claiming that he carried around £2,000 in cash
