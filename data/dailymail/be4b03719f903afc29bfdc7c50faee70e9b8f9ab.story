The grieving parents of Michael Brown said they were unmoved by an apology made by the Ferguson police chief - over a month after their unarmed teenage son was shot dead by an officer.

Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, called for Chief Tom Jackson to be fired and his father, Michael Brown Sr., said rather than an apology, he would like to see Officer Darren Wilson arrested.

The couple gave an in depth interview to the Associated Press over their son's death after he was shot dead by a white police officer on August 9 and  left in the middle of the street for hours.

Brown Sr said: ‘An apology would be when Darren Wilson has handcuffs, processed and charged with murder.’

‘I don't want words, I want action,’ Brown's mom added.

In the video released on Thursday, Police Chief Tom Jackson apologized to the parents  for taking so long to remove the body of their son from the street.  

'I want to say this to the Brown family: No one who has not experienced the loss of a child can understand what you're feeling. I am truly sorry for the loss of your son,' Jackson said.

'I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street. 

'The time that it took involved very important work on the part of investigators, who were trying to collect evidence and gain a true picture of what happened that day, but it was just too long, and I am truly sorry for that.' 

Police officers took more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead by Officer Wilson.

Dead: Police took more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street where he was shot August 9

The unarmed black teenager was fatally shot by Wilson, despite several eyewitness accounts which suggested he had his hands up in a 'don't shoot' position.   

His death sparked days of protests, some violent and many peaceful, in the predominately black neighborhood of Ferguson Missouri where racial tensions reached boiling point.

During the protests, residents said officers were excessively aggressive towards them and unleashed  National Guard troops, tear gas and military equipment.

The police response was also branded inappropriate by officials and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of policing the protests.

In the video apology, Jackson apologized for the heavy handed response from his officers towards the peaceful protesters.

But earlier this week, police officers from the St. Louis County Department were spotted wearing ‘I am Darren Wilson’ bracelets whilst on duty.

Support: The U.S. Justice Department has asked the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department to order its officers not to wear bracelets in support of the white policeman who shot to death an unarmed black teenager

Residents from Ferguson complained about the black bracelets  showing stark white lettering on them with the words 'I am Darren Wilson' emblazoned across it during a meeting with federal officials.

The Brown's family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said the bracelets gave an impression that the police lacked impartiality in the case.

Brown's parents also expressed their disgust towards the officers who wore the bracelets.

‘It lets me know how they really feel about the situation, and the wrongness that they do. How can you work for the law and act like you're above the law? McSpadden said.

The Justice Department has asked Jackson to 'confirm our understanding' that officers were wearing the bracelets in a letter sent on Friday. 

It also asked the Ferguson Police Department  to order its officers not to wear bracelets in support of Wilson.

Brown's parents are in Washington to meet with lawmakers and lobby Congress to pass a law requiring police officers to wear body cameras whilst out on duty. 

Over a month after the shooting of Brown, the fate of Wilson now lies in the hands of a county grand jury which will decide if it should indict Wilson.

Meanwhile, the Justice Department is investigating whether Brown's civil rights were violated.
