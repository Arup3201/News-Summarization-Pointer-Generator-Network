This is the moment a music-lover sparked a mass sing-along by passengers standing on a platform at a London Underground station.

An Erasure fan led an impromptu version of the band's 1980s classic 'A Little Respect' while he was waiting for a train at Kentish Town.

After breaking into song in what started as a solo performance, dozens of passengers decided to join in.

The video was posted online by one of the vocal participants and soon proved a hit on social media. 

Today, the leader of the singalong was revealed as Erasure fan Neil Francis, who sings at venues in and around the Great Yarmouth area in Norfolk.

He launched into the rendition on his way back from an Erasure gig at the nearby Forum music venue - and judging by the reaction, some of the passengers had been to the same concert.

Video footage first shows him taking on the tune himself, before the camera turns to show hoards of other music fans chiming in.

He told the BBC: 'I love the sound of the acoustics in the tube station, so I thought "give it some".

'It went mental, and got louder and louder.'

Mr Francis admitted to having one or two drinks before plucking up the courage to start the singalong.

But the performance proved so popular that passengers then asked him to carry on once he had got on a train.
