New York City striker David Villa went to the top of the Empire State Building to pose with the UEFA Champions League trophy. Joining him were former Brazil and AC Milan midfielder Rivaldo and ex-Chelsea and Barcelona defender Juliano Belletti. 

The trio, who all played for Barcelona in their careers, were taking part in a promotional campaign to help boost the popularity of football in America. 

All three men lifted the trophy during their playing careers, Belletti and Villa both with Barcelona in  2006 and 2011, respectively, while Rivaldo won it with Milan in 2003.

Villa, who is now playing out the twilight of his career in the Big Apple, scored the first goal for his new club on Sunday in a 2-0 win over New England Revolution in the MLS. 

New York City were formed in 2013 and are a subsidiary of the City Football Group that also owns reigning Premier League champions Manchester City. 

Prior to NYCFC's first game at Yankee Stadium, Villa presented a jersey to city mayor Bill DeBlasio
