A Wheel of Fortune contestant who lost out on the chance to win a $1 million prize after mis-pronouncing his answer has been given a second chance by Jimmy Fallon.

Mr Atkinson's misfortune on the popular game show hosted by Pat Sajak attracted a lot of sympathy, after nerves got the better of him, causing him to stumble through his answer.

But after Fallon saw his attempt he invited the contestant to come to New York and appear on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon to prove to the world he did know how to say 'corner curio cabinet'.

Second chance: Jimmy Fallon and Paul Atkinson celebrate as the Wheel of Fortune contestant says his phrase correctly

Fallon said: 'I felt sorry for that guy ... it broke all our hearts,' referring to how Mr Atkinson missed out on his chance to play for a $1 million prize and was left dumb founded as the contestant next to him went on to solve the puzzle by saying it correctly.

Mr Atkinson told Fallon: 'It was part nerves - Pat Sajak was right there and he's a legend - and I had no idea what a curio cabinet was. Never seen the word, never said the word.'

After a drum roll, Fallon then let Mr Atkinson redeem himself, by showing that he does know how to say 'corner curio cabinet'.

And, while it may not have been a $1 million prize, Fallon also presented him with his very own curio cabinet, filled with goodies from the show.

Wheel of Fortune rules state that proper pronunciation of the word or phrase is required to win each puzzle.

Winner: He may have missed out on his $1 million chance but Paul was presented with his own corner curio cabinet by Fallon

Although he had landed on the $1 million wedge, Mr Atkinson would not have necessarily won the prize.

Contestants who land on the wedge hang on to it for the rest of the game and, if they have the highest score and have not landed on the bankruptcy wedges, they are given the chance to play for the big prize.

Only two contestants in the game show's history have ever taken home the big prize. The first was Michelle Loewenstein in 2008 and the second was Autumn Erhard, who won more than $1 million in cash and prizes in May of this year.

Ecstatic: The tuxedoed contestant named Paul was thrilled when he won the chance at $1 million on Wheel of Fortune during their season premier in Las Vegas

Lucky: Paul got very lucky when his spin landed on the One Million spot, which could have won him a lot of money. But his luck was about to change

Things had been looking good for Mr Atkinson when he spun the famous wheel on the long-running game show’s season premier’s. It landed on the coveted Million Dollar prize, in between treacherous Bankruptcy spots.

Mr Atkinson asked for a C, and there were three.

He triumphantly held his million dollar panel, which would have turned into a real million dollars had he continued on his winning track.

But his unfortunate misstep came when he solved the puzzle.

Still happy: Paul triumphantly held up his game piece. Had he kept on that track, he could have eventually won the million bucks

'Curry-O': With only one missing letter, Paul's win seemed like a lock, but he mispronounced 'curio' and lost big time

The words ‘CORNER CURIO CABINET’ tried to come out, but curio just didn’t sound quite right.

After a long, hushed pause, the judges hit the wrong answer buzzer and Mr Atkinson’s neighbor went on to pronounce the words correctly.

Mr Atkinson first looked shocked.

‘It didn't come out the way you intended it to, we'll take a look at it during the commercial to make sure we treated you fairly,’ said host Sajak.

After that, he just looked sad.

He should not feel lonely, however. Last year, a contestant made headlines after losing $4,000 for pronouncing ‘swimming’ with ‘g’ at the end.

Sad face: After judges deemed his bumbled word an incorrect answer, Paul went from jubilant to depressed
