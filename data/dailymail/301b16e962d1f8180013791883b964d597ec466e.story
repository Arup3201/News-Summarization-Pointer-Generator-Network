President Obama reportedly only ate half of the expensive sushi dinner he was treated to last night in Tokyo.

Instead of savoring every morsel of the made-to-order 20-course meal at Sukiyabashi Jiro- dubbed the world's best sushi restaurant and the subject of the 2011 documentary 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi'- the President reportedly put his chopsticks down after only 10 pieces.

The owner of a chicken restaurant that sits in the same basement as the exclusive diner told Tokyo Broadcasting System that Obama stopped at the halfway point even though the famed chef, Jiro Ono, was making each piece especially for the world leaders.

Prime seating: President Obama joined Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for dinner Thursday at the exclusive 10-seat eatery but apparently only ate half of the 20 courses that the famed chef makes for each customer

Less formal but not relaxed: A spy within the restaurant reported that the two men launched immediately into trade talks as soon as they sat down for sushi and sake

Unlike Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe munched the whole way through the offerings from the legendary 88-year-old chef, who times the meal to the customer's pace.

Adding to the drama surrounding their meal at the exclusive 10-seat eatery, the $300-per-person meal was billed as a chance for bonding but a sushi chef from the restaurant said that the leaders' chat was quite formal.

Instead of making small talk and savouring Japanese delicacies at Sukiyabashi Jiro, Obama jumped straight into discussions about trade.

Outwardly, everything appeared to go fine, with both leaders showing their informal approach to the meal by forgoing ties and praising the food afterwards.

Hand-made: The menu at the restaurant, which was the first sushi restaurant to earn three Michelin stars, is made up daily and the diners have no say in what the chef makes them

'That's some good sushi right there,' Obama said to a crowd of journalists waiting outside.

Abe said they had discussed 'a wide range of topics in a relaxed atmosphere' and added even more praise for the food.

'The sushi I had too was the best I had in my life, so far,' Abe said.

The leaders were joined by American Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice.

Smile for the cameras: Obama didn't let on that he stopped halfway through the meal

Chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga refused Thursday to be drawn on exactly how much the US president had eaten, saying only: 'It's true that he ate a good amount'.

'I can tell from his expression he was very much satisfied,' he added. The dinner 'played a great role in building trust between the leaders as they had talks in a relaxed atmosphere.'

Trade is one of the thornier issues at play in the three-day visit, with the two leaders under pressure to make progress on auto and agricultural market access issues blocking agreement on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.
