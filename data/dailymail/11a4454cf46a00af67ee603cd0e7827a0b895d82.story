All 15 to 65-year-olds should be tested for HIV, according to an influential American panel.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is calling for all Americans within this age range to be tested - regardless of whether they are considered to be at high risk.

They hope this change might help to lift some of the stigma associated with HIV testing.

Despite 
efforts to reduce cases of HIV infection in the United States in the 
past three decades, as many as 50,000 Americans become infected with the
virus each year.

All American 15 to 65-year-olds should be tested for HIV according to an influential American panel

The 
Centre for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that almost 1.2 million people in the United States are 
infected with HIV, yet up to 25 per cent of them do not know it.

According
to the CDC, stigma has been a major stumbling block that keeps many 
from seeking out testing, and the hope is that the change will make HIV 
testing a common part of medical care.

The recommendations are based on 
evidence showing the benefits and risks of testing and treatment for 
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Recent
studies have shown that HIV treatment can reduce transmission of the 
virus to an uninfected partner by as much as 96 per cent.

The new
USPSTF guidelines call for screening at least once for all adults, and recommend periodic screening for individuals at higher risk of 
infection. But  they do not specify how frequently people at high risk 
for infection should be tested.

The guidelines also recommend that teens younger than 15 and adults older than 
65 should be screened if they are at increased risk for HIV infection.

And it recommends that all pregnant women - including those in labour - 
who do not know their HIV status should be tested.

High-risk
groups include those who have sex with gay or bisexual men, drug users and economically disadvantaged populations in which HIV rates
are high.

It is hoped this might help to lift some of the stigma associated with HIV testing. Image shows conceptual view of HIV within the blood stream

Task force member Dr Douglas Owens, a
medical professor at Stanford University, said: ‘We do hope the fact 
that the guidelines are all very similar will provide an impetus for 
people to offer screening because it is a very critical public-health 
problem.’

Dr Owens 
said testing all adults within a certain age range may help reduce any 
stigma associated with testing and encourage people to get tested.

The new guidelines from the 
government-backed panel of doctors and scientists now align with 
longstanding recommendations by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention.

Guidelines issued by the USPSTF in 2005 had recommended HIV screening just for high risk individuals.

‘CDC
believes HIV testing should be as routine as a cholesterol test or a 
blood pressure check - but so far fewer than half of Americans have ever
been tested,’ said  Dr Jonathan 
Mermin, director of the CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention, said in a
statement.

As
with the CDC recommendations, the USPSTF guidelines recommend that all 
individuals be offered the test as well as a chance to opt out of 
testing.

‘The Task Force's new recommendations 
will expand the number of Americans who know their HIV status and can 
take action to protect themselves and their partners.'

Experts said the change will likely trigger coverage for the tests as a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act.

Under President Barack Obama's healthcare law, insurers are required to cover preventive services that are recommended by the task force.

Currently, the healthcare law recommends coverage of HIV testing for adolescents and adults who are at high risk of infection.

‘That was based on the 2005 USPSTF recommendations,’ said Dr Jeffrey Lennox, a professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and chief of infectious disease at Grady Memorial Hospital, an inner-city hospital in Atlanta.

‘Now, hopefully they will go back and recategorise that and recommend that it will be covered for every adult.’

Dr Lennox and others said it is too 
early to say whether the new guidelines will result in a significant 
increase in the number of tests, but the potential for insurance 
coverage may help.

Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force ranks preventive services based on the strength of the scientific evidence documenting their benefits.

‘Preventive services with a grade of A 
or B will be covered under these rules. This includes today's HIV 
screening recommendations,’ Ms Peters said.

For doctors, the new recommendations should help clear up any confusion about testing among some primary-care doctors who have not been offering the test to all their adult patients. ‘Now, everybody agrees it should be done,’ Dr Lennox said.

In the UK, about 96,000 people are 
thought to be HIV positive and 25 per cent of people with HIV are 
believed to be unaware that they are infected.

These people are thought to be responsible for 75 per cent of new cases.

It
is thought that HIV is spreading in the UK because of falling condom 
use and some experts believe condom use has fallen because the 
availability of antiretroviral drugs means that people are no longer so 
afraid of HIV/AIDS
