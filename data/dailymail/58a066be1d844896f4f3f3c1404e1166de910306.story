The alleged patriarch at the centre of a shocking incest scandal that spans four generations has arrived back in Australia after fleeing the country.

Charlie Colt, 41, was intercepted by NSW police investigators after being alerted by the Department of Immigration  that he had returned to the country from the UK, reports the Daily Telegraph.

Colt has been accused of fathering three of the children in the infamous Colt family, where it is alleged that 40 adults and children were engaging in incestuous relationships on a squalid bush block in rural NSW. 

Charlie Colt is also accused of engaging in regular sexual intercourse with his sister and having sexual relationships with other children in the family.

The shocking case made news around the world, and has been labeled as one of the most depraved example of inter-family relationship on record.

Mr Colt, labelled under a pseudonym by the order of the court, fled to England in June, after going on the run from police and hiding in Albury-Wodonga, on the NSW and Victorian border, and Adelaide, where a warrant was issued for his arrest.

He denies all allegations against himself and his family, but failed to appear at his scheduled court date in June, when police had hoped to successfully apply to use a DNA sample to prove he had been engaging in incest.

'I’ve never abused a child in my life, I’ve never abused another person,' Charlie Colt told The Daily Telegraph.

'I love my whole family dearly, but not sexually. I think it’s absolutely disgusting, it’s wrong, it’s against everything we were brought up with.'

Mr Colt claimed that the 'rumours' were started by a neighbour who was rebuffed by his sister, accused incest matriarch Betty Colt.

'She told him straight out no and then he turned around and said ‘I suppose you’re f ... ing your brothers aren’t you’. 

'He was in the pub spreading it every night,' he said. 

Daily Mail Australia contacted the head of the NSW Child Abuse Squad, Peter Yeoman, to confirm whether Charlie Colt had arrived back in the country but he was unavailable to comment.

The scandal was revealed by a schoolyard conversation involving one of the children living in incest compound who attended a local school.

The family were engaging in interfamilial sexual relations between siblings, parents, grandparents and grandchildren.

The Department of Family and Community Services raided the Colt's property in 2012.

The scandal was revealed by a schoolyard conversation involving one of the children living in incest compound who attended a local school.

One of the Colt family children was overheard saying at the school: 'My sister is pregnant and we don't know which of my brothers is the father'. 

The police and welfare officers were confronted at the circumstances of those living on the property when they raided the property in the southwest of NSW.

They found the 40 adults and children living in two filthy caravans, two sheds and tents without plumbing.

The family were engaging in interfamilial sexual relations between siblings, parents, grandparents and grandchildren. 

The property was in a state of squalor, with no toilets, showers or baths. The children were unwashed, wore dirty clothes and almost all had fungal infections on their feet. 

Dirt caked the surfaces of stoves and cooking facilities, rotten vegetables lay in a refrigerator and a kangaroo was sleeping on one of the children's beds. 

As well as the appalling conditions of the residence, the children had facial deformities, could not speak intelligibly, and did not know what a toothbrush or toilet paper were.

They were shy and made little eye contact, and the welfare officers learned that few were capable of intelligible speech.

The family groups on the property comprised of sisters, Rhonda, 47, Martha, 33, and Betty Colt, 46, who slept every night with her brother, Charlie, and two of Betty's daughters who each had children who proved to be from unions of related parents.  

Peter Yeoman's, the longstanding boss of the NSW child abuse Squad, said he had never seen anything akin to the generational incest involved the Colt case

Betty Colt-believed to be the matriarch of the group-was jailed earlier this month for a plot to kidnap her children from their carers.

Bobby Colt, one of her sons, said his mother gave him a phone to hide in the back garden of his foster home in an attempt to kidnap him and his brother.

Ms Colt fronted all of her court appearances at Parramatta and at Moss Vale in the NSW Southern Highlands, dressed smartly in a succession of crisp grey or black suits.

Her lawyer, Phil Carey, revealed that Ms Colt was funded only by a Newstart allowance. 

However, court documents found that following the removal of five of her children by authorities, Ms Colt  was struggling financially.

The investigations are ongoing. 

Earlier this month, after incest matriarch Betty Colt was jailed for attempted to kidnap her sons from the foster homes and put them to work as fruitpickers, court documents were released detailing the relationship between Colt and her 15-year-old son, Bobby

Betty tells Bobby his voice sounds 'so sexy' on the phone. She says she intends to fight to get him and his brother Billy back out of care and she hopes the 'c****' are listening. She says when she gets him out after he turns 16 he can get his own place if he wants.

He tells her 'the cops' had talked to him about raping a girl at school.

Betty tells him: 'They have nothing'.

She puts on Bobbby's aunt Rhonda, who tells him: 'Your voice got deeper'.

Then Betty tells Bobby again that she likes his voice and '... ohhh, you can say it alright'.

August 8, 2013

9.05pm to 11.09 pm - 15 texts between mother and son.

9.25pm Bobby to Betty: Love you.

9.36pm Bobby to Betty: Love all.

9.56pm Bobby to Betty: Love all.

10.09pm Betty to Bobby: Bobby xoxoxoxoxo.

September 6, 2013

Betty tells Bobby the court case is getting her down, saying: 'I'm meant to have raped you all.

'They reckon I've had sex with you boys even [she names her youngest son and nephew]. Everyone.

Bobby: 'I think we're a bit young for that.'

Betty: 'Sick f****. I'm meant to have put all the girls in a tent and told all you boys who to have sex with. '

Bobby: 'Have they got any proof?'

Betty: 'Well it never happened, so they don't have shit ... they're trying to say that my dad is your dad, not that my dad is your grandad.

'They just want me to get prison time. I've done nothing f****** wrong.'

Bobby: 'All you have done is try to help people. '

Betty: 'That's f****** right. They think I slept with [brother's name] and my dad and they are fathers of my kids.'

Bobby: 'You can have them locked up for making stories.'

September 17, 2013, 6.32pm

Betty: 'How ya been gorgeous.'

Bobby: 'Yeah alright.'

Betty: 'What ya been up to ... you only got a couple of weeks until you're 16, then you can walk out of there.'

Bobby: '...it doesn't feel right leaving when I'm 16, leaving the others behind.'

Betty: '...you pack your bags. We found out DOCS can't intervene if you just walk out. They can't f****** stop yas.'

Two days later, Bobby tells his mother 'they found out who my father is'.

She objects and says ,'no they don't ... your father was Tom Wilson. Don't talk to anyone.'

When two of Betty's daughters appear to have confessed to welfare authorities the true nature of sexual relations in the incest camp, she is contemptuous and unforgiving.

She puts another daughter on to talk about the traitor,Tammy.

Bobby responds, 'She's not one of our family no more ... she's a stupid b****'.

On September 29, 2013

As police are closing in on Ms Colt's kidnap plot as the allotted date draws near for her to be reunited with Bobby, she texts him: 'Love you big boy, love you very very much.'

Four days later Betty Colt was arrested in a car park on the NSW South Coast and charged.
