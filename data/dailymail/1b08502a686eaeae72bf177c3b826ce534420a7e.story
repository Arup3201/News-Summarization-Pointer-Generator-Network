Angry at a car that had edged into a cycle-only box at traffic lights, this determined cyclist decided to give the occupants a piece of his mind. Not once, but twice.

First the man remonstrated with them by shouting through the window of the white Audi A7 which had crept into the zone reserved for cyclists.

When the Audi sped off, the infuriated cyclist rode as fast as he could to catch up with it at the next set of lights and keep up his high-volume rant.

Incident: A road rage fight was sparked by an Audi A7 encroaching on a cycle box on the Farringdon Road in central London

Confrontation: A cyclist leaned over to the car to point out that the motorist had no right to wait in the box

Race: When the car sped away, the infuriated cyclist rushed to catch up with it at the next set of traffic lights

The incident was captured by another 
cyclist's helmet camera as he travelled to work along the busy 
Farringdon Road in central London.

One smartly dressed man remonstrated with the car's driver, telling him he was not supposed to be there because the space was reserved for cyclists, but the motorist sped off.

The cyclist can be seen riding as fast as possible to catch up with the motorist at the next set of lights, where he confronted him once again.

He called the driver a 'f***ing p***k' and added that the Audi had nearly run over his foot.

Annoyed: The cyclist swore at the driver of the white Audi, calling him a f****** p***

Anger: A passenger emerged from the car and began to fight back against the cyclist

Punch: The cyclist was knocked to the ground with a left hook, captured on video from another cyclist's helmet

Grapple: Horrified bystanders looked on as the two men fought in the middle of stationary traffic

Investigation: Police are hoping to hear from the cyclist who was knocked to the ground

But then a passenger suddenly got out 
and hit the cyclist with a left hook, before pushing him off his bike 
and into a taxi, which was also waiting in traffic. He yelled 
obscenities at the man then returned to the Audi and was driven away.

The incident was filmed and uploaded to YouTube by 26-year-old Jude, a magazine editor.

He said he could not tell whether or not the car had hit the man's bike, but insisted that the driver paid 'little or no attention to the safety of the cyclist'.

He added: 'Confrontations between cyclists and motorists are a daily occurrence in the same way that drivers shouting at other drivers from inside their car is common.

'That this resulted in physical violence is what makes it so shocking, I have never seen that before.

'It was shocking, you do not expect to see that kind of behaviour on the roads.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said that officers were aware of the incident but had not received a complaint.

'We are keen to hear from the cyclist if he wants to report it,' he said.
