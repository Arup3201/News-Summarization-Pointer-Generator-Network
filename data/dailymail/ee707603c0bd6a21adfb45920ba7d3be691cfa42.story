He's known as the 'Pillowcase rapist,' and spent the last 20 years in a California mental hospital. 

Prosecutors say 62-year-old Christopher Hubbart sexually assaulted some 40 women.

Now he is set to be released and move into a residential community north of Los Angeles by the first week of July in spite of a host of vocal protests.

Neighbors there say they are angry, afraid and fighting to keep him out.

So many arrests: Mr Hubbart was released into parole multiple times, and he assaulted women every single time - forcing officials to arrest and re-incarcerate him

Home sweet home: This is the Lake Los Angeles home officials have decided will house the serial rapist

Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Gilbert Brown issued a brief order saying that Hubbart, 63, must be released by July 7, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.

With several severe restrictions that include 24-hour GPS monitoring, Hubbart will be allowed to rent a small house in a remote area in Lake Los Angeles, near the city of Palmdale.

The decision comes two days after a daylong hearing in Northern California, where Brown heard passionate objections from residents, many of whom drove 350 miles north from Southern California.

Hubbart's most recent crimes occurred in Santa Clara County, but Brown ordered him released to Los Angeles County, where Hubbart was born and raised.

A very sick man: Christopher Hubbart admitted to raping 38 women, but said about 70 other rapes went unreported

Hubbart has acknowledged raping and assaulting about 40 women between 1971 and 1982, when he was sentenced to 16 years in prison.

He was paroled in 1990, but arrested in a new attack just two months later and returned to prison until 1996.

When his term ended, he was deemed a sexually violent predator and confined to a state mental hospital. Doctors at the hospital recently concluded he was fit for release, but few options were available.

California laws bar sex offenders from living within 2,000 feet of schools and other places where children congregate, eliminating nearly all urban areas in the state.

Furious: Bart Stone says he has no choice but to move if the rapist relocates to the neighborhood

Local leaders quickly denounced the decision.

County Supervisor Michael Antonovich called it 'an unconscionable threat to public safety.'

Palmdale Mayor James Ledford said he was 'a little upset' on learning the news.

'It's very disappointing, very disappointing that this guy with this kind of record in the past would be put into any community,' he said.

Ledford said the city is going to continue to try to fight the order.

‘I have a daughter, so this isn't going to work for me,’ Bart Stone told NBC.

Mr Stone stood in front of the house and pointed about 100 feet down the street to a school bus stop.

‘That’s where children get off,’ he angrily shouted.

Just a door down from a bus stop: 'You see that right there, past the PT Cruiser, that's where the drop the kids off' Mr Stone points to and explains

The home is within a few miles of two schools and only 2,200 feet from a nearby park – just outside the limits of Jessica’s Law, which prohibits predators from living closer than 2,000 feet to any park or school.

The landlord of the property has agreed to rent the home to Hubbart, seeing as it falls within the laws for sex offenders.

‘The bus stop is right in front of my house, with all the kids,’ Steve Villavicincio told CBS Los Angeles, ‘I don’t know what the heck’s going on with that.’

Markeisha Brooks, 19, pointed to three houses where children live, telling CBS Los Angeles that ‘a lot of children live around here… he’s a rapist and he can do it again.’

Mr Hubbart was put on parole multiple times, and kept raping women in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, terrorizing the state with his deviancy.

Officials are also united in their displeasure to dump the rapist in the community.

The pervert’s most recent sojourn back into custody came because he couldn’t control his violent urges, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich told KNX.

'That's crazy': Steve Villavicincio lives next door, the bus stop is in front of his home, he cannot believe officials think the home is suitable for a rapist

‘He belongs in a mental institution, a state hospital’ Mr Antonovich said during a recent press conference, ‘he does not belong in a community with children where he will once again commit these crimes.’

‘His past behavior is not a one-time occurrence where he made a mistake. We’re talking over and over again,’ Mr Antonovich added.

They're taking someone who is not from here — who has a horrific criminal record — and they're dumping him in the [area],’ a Palmdale city spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times.

‘We don't think that's right,’ the spokesperson added.

Mr Hubbart was first arrested in 1972 for multiple rapes in southern California, he soon admitted raping 20 women, records cited by the Times show.

Only seven years later, he was released from a mental health institution after doctors deemed him a changed man. He was snagged again in 1982 for raping more women.

Based on his own estimates, Mr Hubbart raped well over 100 women.

‘It really angers me,’ another local resident told the Times. ‘My wife and I are getting to the point where we're anxious to leave California anyway. That might get us to... move quicker.’

Mr Hubbart will be required to wear a GPS monitor at all times, an official told the Times.

The monitor will be able to alert authorities if he violates the terms of his release by beng to close to a school or park, or even if he violates curfew.

Still, that’s not enough to satisfy people living in the proposed area.

Not in our neighborhood!: Residents are furious the predator is set to live only feet from a school bus stop and within a few miles of multiple schools

‘This is like a bad dream right now because I'm going to have to move out of this neighborhood,’ Mr Stone told NBC Bay Area

Cheryl Holbrook, one of the residents who drove north to the hearing and a member of a community group created to fight the release, said she and others from the Ladies of Lake LA were already heading to protest at Hubbart's new home, which is about five miles from her own.

Holbrook said she was shaking because of the news, which she said was made worse by terrible memories of being raped as a 14-year-old by two men at knifepoint and impregnated.

'I think it's wrong,' Holbrook said. 'When this guy commits another crime, the blood's going to be on that judge's shoulders.'
