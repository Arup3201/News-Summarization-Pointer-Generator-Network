A father accused of killing his teenage daughter for dishonouring their strict Pakistani culture wept yesterday as he denied he was a murderer.

Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, is accused of suffocating 17-year-old Shafilea with a plastic bag in the culmination of months of rows about her Westernised behaviour.

Giving evidence yesterday, his barrister told him: ‘The prosecution say you’re a murderer.’

‘I am not,’ the Pakistan-born taxi driver responded.

Asked by Tom Bayliss, QC, how it felt 
to stand trial accused of murdering his own daughter, he replied: ‘I 
can’t believe it – it’s devastating.’

Ahmed and his wife Farzana, 49 – seen  leaving court yesterday in handcuffs (above) – both deny murdering Shafilea.

Ahmed,
who sobbed in the witness box, denied there had been any arguments on 
the night Shafilea was last seen alive nearly nine years ago.

He
said he had been the last one to go to bed apart from Shafilea, who was
downstairs ‘doing her homework’. The next morning, she had vanished, he
said, adding that they had assumed she had run away as she had done 
twice before.

Earlier in the trial, the jury heard from Shafilea’s younger sister, Alesha, that both her parents took part in a murderous attack that night – September 11, 2003.

Victim:
Shafilea disappeared in September 2003 and her body was found on the 
bank of the River Kent in Cumbria the following February

She claimed their mother began it by saying – in Urdu – ‘Just finish it here’, before picking up the plastic bag which her husband held in place until Shafilea went limp.

Mrs Ahmed originally claimed no argument took place that night, but earlier this week she dramatically changed her account.

She now says she saw her husband angrily hitting and punching Shafilea that night. The following morning, she says she asked her husband where Shafilea was, to which he allegedly responded: ‘If you care for your dear life and that of your children, don’t ever ask me this question again.’

Yesterday Ahmed was asked by his barrister how he felt about his wife. He replied: ‘I love her to bits.’

Asked if that had changed now she had altered her account, he answered: ‘No.’

Ahmed, giving evidence at Chester Crown Court, broke down as he denied ever having been violent towards his eldest daughter.

Ahmed said the family had endured ‘constant attention’ from police and the media following Shafilea’s disappearance. ‘We never got any rest,’ he said, describing the coverage as ‘constant finger-pointing’.

Of the impact of the trial on the family, he insisted: ‘We have been fighting to achieve justice for our daughter Shafilea.’

Shafilea’s body was found in February 2004, dumped beside a river in Cumbria.

Her parents were charged with her murder after Alesha, now 23, came forward in 2010.

The trial has also heard an account allegedly given by a third sister, Mevish, to a friend describing her father hitting Shafilea on the night of her disappearance.

However, Mevish, now 21, told the court she had made it up.

The trial continues.
