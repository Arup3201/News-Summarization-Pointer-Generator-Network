A woman who lost 13 and a half stone in weight but was left with a permanent apron of skin around her waist will celebrate her 40th birthday by wearing a bikini for the first time ever.

Linda McKnight, 39, will wear a two-piece for the first time in her life following surgery known as an apronectomy to remove six pounds of excess skin hanging from her stomach.

She underwent the NHS funded operation earlier this year after dropping from a size 32 to a size 12 and will on Saturday jet off to Mexico with husband Gary, 45, to celebrate her 40th birthday by wearing a bikini in public for the first time ever.

Aged just 32 and weighing 24st 7 lb at a size 32, Linda was warned she would not live to see her 40th birthday unless she lost weight

Linda, a health care worker in a nursery school, said: ‘ I worked so hard to lose all the weight on my own but being left with all that skin was awful.

‘It was like wearing a permanent rubber ring of skin around my waist.

‘I used to wear two pairs of tights to try and smooth it down but nothing could flatten it.

‘But now I’m about to turn 40 and in the best shape of my life which is not bad considering I was once told I was so fat that wouldn't live to see it.’

Linda began struggling with her weight as a teenager. When she started her first job as a trainee hairdresser she admits spending all her money on takeaways.

She explains: ‘ It was a special treat to have a take away so when I started earning my own money I started treating myself.

‘I’d have chips or an Indian meal for supper after work.’

But soon she was spending money on bacon rolls for breakfast and fish and chips for lunch too.

She was already a size 20 weighing 17st when she met engineer husband Gary aged 20.

Linda from Greenock, says: ‘ He wasn’t bothered about my weight at all so after we got together I just kept on eating and growing.

Locked in a cycle of self-loathing and comfort eating Linda's weight continued to rise and she became breathless even from walking

Despite wishing to slim she just couldn't ditch the take away meals - until later that year her doctor delivered a stark warning

Four years later the couple holidayed in the Canary Islands with Linda weighing 24 stone and a dress size 26.

She says: ‘I was sweating buckets the whole time we were there. I tried to cover up in t-shirts but that just made me ever hotter.

‘I was so big even walking left me out of breath. It was horrific. I watched the other women on the beach in bikinis and wished it was me.’

But all attempts to diet failed as Linda was locked in a cycle of self-loathing and comfort eating.

She was even bigger when the couple flew to Florida on holiday in 2000 Linda was mortified to need a seat belt extension on the flight.

She recalls: ‘ It was so embarrassing. I was worried I wouldn’t even be able to fit into the seat.’

But there was more shame to come when she realised she was too fat to fit into any of the rides at Disneyland.

She says: ‘I was queuing for a rollercoaster when staff took me to one side and said I needed to sit in the sample seat to make sure I would fit.

‘I followed them and sat down but the seat belt wouldn’t close. I was told I was too big to ride.’

She fled and was too embarrassed to try any other rides. ‘ I knew it would be the same. I couldn’t believe we had wasted so much money going there.’

But it was in 2003, the year she married Gary, that her weight peaked and she reached a dress size 32.

She says she tried almost every bridal shop in Glasgow looking for a dress in her size and eventually had to order one from America.

She says: ‘ Even then it was so tight I could barely breath and being so uncomfortable ruined the day.’

The years of overeating had left a giant flap of skin known as an apron hanging from her stomach and she was told she would need surgery to remove it

But she was mortified when in 2006 a child at the school where she worked drew a picture of her as a big round blob.

Linda says: ‘ She gave it to me as a present and I just took it home and cried. Bless her she had no idea it had upset me but she was right, that was how I looked.’

But despite wishing to slim she just couldn’t ditch the take away meals - until later that year her doctor delivered a stark warning.

Aged just 32 and weighing 24st 7 lb, Linda was warned she would not live to see her 40th birthday unless she lost weight.

She recalls: ‘ He didn’t mince his words. He said I would suffer a heart attack and die unless I lost weight.’

Linda ate a strict diet of only fresh fruit, vegetables and lean meat to drop the pounds

He offered to refer her for gastric surgery but Linda was determined to try again to lose the weight herself.

This time she joined a local slimming club and in the first week in January 2007 lost a stone.

The diet involved eating only fresh fruit, vegetables and lean meat. Linda says: ‘I hadn’t eaten like that for years and was surprised to actually enjoy it.’

It took four years for Linda to lose 13st 7lb and reach her goal weight of 11st.

She says: ‘I set little goals and worked towards them. It took years to get that big I knew it wouldn’t come off overnight.’

Finally in 2011 she reached a size 12. She says: ‘ I felt fantastic and was happy in my clothes but underneath that there was a problem.’

The years of overeating had left a giant flap of skin known as an apron hanging from her stomach over her pubic area.

Linda was so ashamed of it she rarely let her husband see her naked and was still unable to wear clothes she liked.

She tried to disguise it with spanx and even considered wrapping it in cling film.

But even worse were repeated skin infections caused by the folds of flesh rubbing together.

She says: ‘ It would get very sweaty and inflamed and my GP was always prescribing antibiotics and creams to calm it down.

‘I never regretted losing the weight but I felt disappointed that I couldn’t enjoy it as I hoped because of the skin. I just hoped if I kept exercising it would go.’

Eventually in 2012 she spoke to her GP who confirmed her worst fears, that the skin would need to be surgically removed.

He referred her for the procedure known as an apronectomy, but before being given the green light Linda first needed to demonstrate that she would indeed keep the weight off.

Linda, pictured with her husband Gary, went bikini shopping for the first time in her life just weeks after her surgery, snapping up four different costumes to wear on a holiday to mark her 40th

She said: ‘I had maintained for a long time by then so I was confident that I would pass the interview.’

Finally she was offered an appointment with a surgeon in December 2013 who agreed she would be a good candidate.

She went under the knife on January 14th this year – leaving hospital a full six pounds lighter after the operation.

She now weighs 10st 8lbs and went down from a size 12 to a size 10 bringing her total loss to 14st.

Weeks later Linda went bikini shopping for the first time in her life, snapping up four different costumes to wear on a holiday to mark her 40th.

She says: ‘Once I was told I would be dead by 40, now I’m marking the occasion by wearing a bikini.

‘It feels amazing and I am so grateful to the surgeon for doing such an amazing job. It really has changed my life.

‘I’m fitter and healthier than I have ever been and now thanks to the surgery I can finally enjoy all the hard work.’
