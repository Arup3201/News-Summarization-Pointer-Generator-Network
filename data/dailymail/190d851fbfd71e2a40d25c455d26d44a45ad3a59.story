Employees at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco will soon be taking their meals in 100-year-old log cabins.

The high-tech giant is installing a pair of historic log cabins that were built in the late 1800s by Wild West pioneers to serve as dining rooms in its Market Street building.

The cabins were salvaged from former homestead ranches in Montana by a Marin County contractor and sold to the owner of an architectural firm helping to refurbish Twitter, Inc.'s headquarters. They were then dismantled and shipped mote than a thousand miles to San Francisco.

Twitter is undergoing something of a lo-fi makeover with its new headquarters in the art deco Western Furniture Exchange and Merchandise Mart building, which is being decorated with a forest-themed motif, reports the

'There's something nice about the character of the real wood. Visually there's a patina of age. It isn't something fake. It's real. It's reclaimed,' Olle Lundberg of Lundberg Design, the San Francisco architectural firm responsible for the specialty design elements in the new office told the Marin Independent Journal.

'We've used the notion of the forest as a nice tie-in with Twitter and its bird logo,' he explained.

Lundberg bought the salvaged buildings after seeing them listed on Craigslist.

He has also used the wooden planks from an old bowling alley to build a reception desk in the main lobby and fashioned Twitter logos from old California license plates.

In order to transport the cabins from Montana to San Francisco, they were taken apart and trucked to 1355 Market St, where they will be reconstructed.

They should be in place within a few weeks. The plan is to build booths inside them for company employees to sit in while they eat.

There will also be TV monitors and a coffee station inside the 20-foot-by-20-foot buildings within a building.

Also included in the fit-out are a yoga studio, a rooftop garden, an arcade and other luxurious amenities.

The headquarters is in the Mid-Market part of San Francisco, a blighted area marked by its homeless population.

Businesses have been encouraged to move there in exchange for tax breaks, in a government effort to revitalize the area.
