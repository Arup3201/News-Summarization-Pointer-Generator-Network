Budget supermarkets Aldi and Lidl are enjoying a surge in sales as shoppers desert the ‘big four’ chains.

Sales at Aldi rose 35.3 per cent in the past 12 weeks, compared with the same period a year ago, while the figure at Lidl was 17.2 per cent.

By contrast, as the German chains open shops at the rate of one a week, Tesco continues to lose sales despite a £1billion turnaround plan. Its sales in the past 12 weeks were down by 3 per cent on a year ago.

Morrisons suffered an even bigger fall of 3.8 per cent. The drop at Sainsbury’s was 1.7 per cent, while Asda proved the most resilient of the major stores with a fall of 0.5 per cent.

The decrease in sales at the big four partly reflects the fact that Easter falls later this year, on April 20 compared with March 31 last year.

This means the latest figures, from the retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel, do not cover a busy period featured in last year’s.

Tesco's sales in the past 12 weeks were down by 3 per cent on a year ago, however this fall has been exaggerated by the fact Easter falls later this year.

Last week, the company announced that one of its most senior executives, the finance director, Laurie McIlwee, has decided to leave amid rumours of a clash over the direction of the business.

Britain’s biggest retailer is due to publish its annual profits next week, which are expected to show a fall of £200million to £3billion.

Morrisons suffered an even bigger sales fall of 3.8per cent over the last 12 weeks.

The company appears particularly vulnerable to the threat from the budget chains and has announced it is cutting prices by £1billion over three years to try and take them on.

Sainsbury’s, which has previously been immune to the threat of Aldi and Lidl, saw sales fall by 1.7 per cent, while the figure at Asda was down by 0.5per cent.

Total sales growth for all supermarkets over the 12 weeks was just 0.6per cent compared to a year ago.

The study says the figure would still have been a very modest 1.5per cent if Easter had fallen at the same time this year.

Edward Garner, of Kantar, said: ‘Amid a challenging market backdrop, individual retailer growth might be expected to be restricted. 

‘This is certainly not the case for Aldi which achieved its highest ever growth of 35.3 per cent , boosting the retailer to a record market share of 4.6 per cent.   Lidl also experienced strong growth in a record breaking month and now accounts for 3.4per cent of the market. 

‘All of the ‘big four’ supermarkets have faced declining sales over the past 12 weeks, which has been accentuated by the late falling of Easter.  Nevertheless, they have also seen worrying share declines.’

Aldi and Lidl have made a concerted effort to attract middle income families with everything from fresh Aberbeen Angus fillet steaks at £5 each to award winning wine, coffee and cheese.

Waitrose has managed to hold on to its record 5 per cent market share, while the Co-Op appears to have stemmed falls in sales.
