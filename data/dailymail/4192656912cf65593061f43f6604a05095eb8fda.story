A number of turkeys are likely to be left feeling ‘unfulfilled’ tomorrow as stuffing topped the list of items most likely to be forgotten in the Christmas shop, new research revealed. 

Almost half of Brits (44 per cent) admit to forgetting at least one Christmas dinner essential in the mad Yuletide rush.

Stuffing (11 per cent) was followed closely by cranberry sauce (10 per cent) as the most forgotten item.

Almost half of Britons forget at least one Christmas dinner essential in the mad Yuletide rush

Stuffing (pictured), cranberry sauce, brandy sauce, bread sauce and sausages were the top five forgotten foods. While 3 per cent of shoppers have forgotten to purchase the all-essential turkey

Amazingly, three per cent of those surveyed said they were guilty of forgetting to buy the turkey when doing their Christmas food shopping, even though they passed by the poultry aisle. 

The survey of 4,000 Brits by Morrisons also revealed that 18-24 year olds are more than twice as likely to forget to buy a turkey for their Christmas dinner than stock up on alcohol supplies.

Overall, five per cent will forget to buy alcohol as opposed to the three per cent who admitted forgetting to buy the most important item on the Christmas menu. 

It also revealed that we are a nation of over-shoppers with almost half of us (48 per cent) having to eat Christmas leftovers until the New Year due to overestimating the shopping. 

But a smug 47 per cent do buy just the right amount of food and drink.

Brits will throw away the equivalent of 4.2 million dinners on Christmas Day, a study by Unilever revealed 

On Christmas Day itself, a study by Unilever revealed British households will throw away the equivalent of 4.2 million dinners.

The food we leave on our plates on December 25 adds up to to 263,000 turkeys, 740,000 Christmas puddings and 17.2 million Brussels sprouts across the UK.

Figures showed that nearly 10 per cent of every festive meal is thrown away, which equates to an incredible £64million of wasted food.

The sprouts alone would fill 1,000 wheelie bins, leftover carrots would reach from London to Munich when lined up end-to-end and unused gravy would fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool.
