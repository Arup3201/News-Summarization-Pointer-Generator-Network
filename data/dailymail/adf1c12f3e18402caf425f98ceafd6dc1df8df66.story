The man accused of murdering teenager Masa Vukotic claims he threw a punch at Prime Minister Tony Abbott nearly a decade ago.

Mr Abbott, who was Federal Health Minister at the time, visited the Thomas Embling Hospital  in Melbourne's inner-north on February 22, 2006 when he was reportedly hit in the face by a patient.

The Victorian  hospital, which is located in Fairfield, provides advanced clinical treatment and programs for patients from the criminal justice or mental health systems.

Before Sean Christian Price, 31, was charged with stabbing 17-year-old schoolgirl to death, he revealed to The Age that he was the patient who punched Mr Abbott nine years ago.

'I hit him and he stepped back and shaped up like a boxer,' Mr Price told The Age.

'Then he dropped his hands and smiled, and said 'I've been hit harder than that on the football field'.'

A spokeswoman for Mr Abbott at the time of the incident said one of the patients 'had a go at Tony' when he was visiting several mental health service providers in Melbourne.

'It was over in about three seconds. It was so not a big deal,' the spokeswoman told AAP.

'(The patient) did take a swing. He did connect, but to say he punched him is overstating it.

'The quote from Tony is: 'It is a matter of complete inconsequence'.'

Masa Vukotic, 17, was stabbed in daylight while walking along a path just metres from her home on Tuesday

The revelation comes after the 31-year-old fronted Melbourne Magistrates Court on Friday after he was charged with murdering Masa in a Doncaster park near her home on Tuesday night.

Masa was stabbed in daylight while walking along a path at Koonung Creek Linear Reserve shortly before 7pm in what police believe was a 'random attack'.

Mr Price was also charged with six other offences including one count of rape, two counts of robbery and three counts of common law assault including an attempted carjacking.
