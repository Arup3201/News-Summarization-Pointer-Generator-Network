When photos of Solange Knowles covered in a rash of painful looking hives surfaced over the weekend, the world suppressed a collective shudder.

But according to experts, the condition isn't as rare as you might imagine, with one in six regularly succumbing to the skin condition.

Causes can range from extreme heat to freezing cold, as well as stress, allergic reactions and skin infections.

Solange Knowles put her break out of hives down to having over-heated whilst at her wedding

Solange's sister Beyonce tried to help her younger sister by covering her face in the car 

So what caused Solange's? Based on a tweet sent by the star to one fan, heat could have been the culprit.

Writing on the social media site, she said:'Got em from turning up x100 during our second line.I was hot,wearing a cape,& happy as hell :).' 

But over-heating is not the only thing that can trigger an outbreak. Dr Maria Gonzalez, Consultant Dermatologist from the Specialist Skin Clinic, revealed that hives are the result of more than just a hot day out.

'Hives is the common name for a skin condition known as urticaria,' she explained. 'In this condition patients come out in wheals or hives which last for several hours and can be quite itchy or unsightly.

'This is a relatively a common problem as many of us will suffer from hives at some point, nearly all of which will settle spontaneously - usually within six weeks. 

'However, some unlucky people suffer which chronic urticaria in that they break out in hives repeatedly over many years.

In particularly bad cases hives can join together forming larger red and swollen areas on the skin

The lumps caused by hives can be red and itchy but doctors say antihistamines and soothing creams can help the situation

'Some known triggers are allergies to things like nuts or as a response to sun exposure. Urticaria may also occur in patients with underlying problems such as thyroid disease.' 

PurePotions are a 100% skincare brand created by mother Natalie Balmond. 

Her calendula and comfrey rescue salve is perfect for anyone suffering from hives as it helps to alleviate the itching. 

It also forms a semi-occlusive barrier over the skin which stops irritants and dirt getting to the affected area.

According to Dr Gonzalez, the stress associated with wedding planning may also have played a part in Solange's break out.

'There is a group of patients such as Solange Knowles whose trigger appears to be stress, suggesting a link between stress and our immune system.'

Dr Tony Steele, a GP with over 25 years’ experience says that when stress is the trigger for a break out, breathing exercises can help.

He said: 'On rare occasions pure stress and anxiety can trigger an outbreak of hives. 

'People who experience this problem could try taking a non-sedating antihistamine before a stressful event or avoid stressful event all together. 

'Other things which might help are relaxation techniques such as controlled breath and even meditation.'

Solange managed to cure hers with a liberal dose of antihistamine Benadryl - a cure she later revealed on Instagram.

Referring to her choreographed dance with 10-year-old son Julez, she said: 'Shout out to Benadryl yo, lol. NOTHING was gonna stop me from having my mother and son dance with Julez.

'My baby killed it and will forever remain my favorite dance partner of all time.'

According to Dr Steele, the mother-of-one had the right idea.

'Antihistamines can help with the itch, as can soothing creams, such as calamine lotion,' he said. 'In severe prolonged cases anti-inflammatory steroids are prescribed.'
