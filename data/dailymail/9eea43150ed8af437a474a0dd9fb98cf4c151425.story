North Korean dictator Kim Jong has been given a guided tour of an indoor vegetable farm.

The dictator was photographed visiting the Jangchon Vegetable Co-op Farm in Sadong District, Pyongyang, North Korea.

Kim said that the farm turned into a vegetable production base for the citizens of the capital city under the guidance of former leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. 

The smile was back on for a visit to a vegetable farm in Pyongyang on Tuesday, however, with Kim keen to praise growers for their vital work

A photograph was also released today of Kim Jong-un visiting the Hydro-meteorological Service in Pyongyang.

He said there are many incorrect forecasts as the meteorological observation has not been put on a modern and scientific basis.

He was of course pictured sitting a desk with an ashtray near him -if the North Korean leader isn’t smoking in photographs, an ashtray is often in close proximity.

Public criticism is rare in North Korea, with Kim usually keen to praise government agencies in an attempt to pass his regime off as a success

Meanwhile 
today Singapore filed criminal charges against a shipping company 
implicated in a shipment of weapons to North Korea that was seized by 
Panamanian authorities last year.

Locally
 registered Chinpo Shipping Company Ltd. was charged with transferring 
$72,000 to a Panama shipping agent knowing that the funds could be used 
to contribute to the 'nuclear-related, ballistic missile-related, or 
other weapons of mass destruction-related programs or activities' of 
North Korea.

A
 Chinpo executive, 50-year-old Singapore citizen Tan Hui Tin, who is the
 daughter of Chinpo's chairman, was charged for withholding potential 
electronic evidence.

The charges follow Panama's seizure in June last year of a North Korean ship headed from Cuba to North Korea. Panamanian authorities suspected it was transporting drugs but found two Cuban fighter jets in perfect condition, missiles and live munitions beneath the Chong Chon Gang's cargo of sugar.

Panama says the weapons violated U.N. sanctions that restrict arms trading with North Korea because of its nuclear weapons program.

In March, the United Nations Security Council's sanctions committee named Chinpo as one of two companies involved in trying to ship arms to North Korea.

The other was Ocean Maritime Management, a Pyongyang-based company.

Singapore's foreign ministry said authorities received information about Chinpo in January this year.

A panel of experts advising the Security Council said in its annual report on North Korea that the country's embassies, including in Singapore and Cuba, were suspected of helping to organize arms shipments to Pyongyang via complex financial methods that were 'pioneered by drug-trafficking organizations.'

The report said Chinpo Shipping Company was 'co-located' with the North Korean Embassy in Singapore and that the shipping firm acted as the agent for Ocean Maritime Management, which operated the Chong Chon Gang.

A woman who answered the phone at Chinpo declined to comment.
