Britain should switch to a four-day working week to combat stress, a leading doctor has said.

Professor John Ashton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said that shorter hours would allow workers to spend more time with their families and help reduce unemployment.

Reducing the standard working week from five days to four would also help combat medical conditions such as high blood pressure and mental health problems. 

Health benefits: Shorter hours would help beat stress and combat conditions such as high blood pressure and mental health problems. Britons are notorious for putting in some of the longest hours in Europe

Professor Ashton, who has spent almost 40 years working in public health, said: ‘When you look at the way we lead our lives, the stress that people are under, the pressure on time and sickness absence, [work-related] mental health is clearly a major issue.

‘We should be moving towards a four-day week because we problem we have in the world of work is you’ve got a proportion who are working too hard and a proportion that haven’t got jobs.

‘We’ve got a maldistribution of work. The lunch-hour has gone; people just have a sandwich at their desk and carry on working.’

Professor Ashton, who leads more than 3,300 public health experts working in the NHS, local government and academia, spoke out after the law was changed to give all employees the right to ask for flexible hours.

This could mean anything from a three-day week to only working during the school term time – options that had been reserved for parents and carers.

Britons are notorious for putting in some of the longest hours in Europe, with the average worker clocking up some 250 hours more a year than their German counterpart.

'Crazy hours': Professor John Ashton (pictured) said that some Britons are working too much

One in three British adults has high blood pressure, a ‘silent killer’ that trebles the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

It can also damage the kidneys and eyes and is becoming increasingly linked to dementia.

Around one in six workers is experiencing stress, anxiety or depression at any one time, the charity Mind says.

Professor Ashton said that some Britons are working ‘crazy hours’, while others can’t get a job.

He said that a shorter working week would give more time for exercise and family life, including the opportunity to do the school run.

He told the Guardian: ‘We need a four-day week so that people can enjoy their lives, have more time with their families and maybe reduce high blood pressure because people might start exercising on that extra day.

‘If you’ve got two people in a couple working, they need to be able to work in such a way that they can spend time together with their children.  It’s a nightmare.’

A recent YouGov poll found that 57 per cent of workers are in favour of a four-day week.

The Trades Union Congress agreed that many people would welcome as shorter working week but questioned how easy it would be to for them to obtain. 

Professor Ashton said: ‘The practicalities of implementing such a policy would be complex, not least because of the high cost of living that prohibits many people from working fewer hours.

‘Nevertheless, it is important that we have a working pattern that is good for our health as well as our economy and wider society.’
