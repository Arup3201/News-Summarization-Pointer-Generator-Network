A librarian in New Mexico claims that she witnessed her boss and a city maintenance worker having sex in the library's children's section earlier this year and reported it to her superiors - and then SHE got fired.

The alleged incident happened one morning in August - Estancia assistant librarian Jamie Kurz got to work a little early and noticed two cars in the library's parking lot: her boss' and a city maintenance truck.

She didn't find anything strange about the maintenance truck being in the library's parking lot - until she walked in the building.

Nothing suspicious: Kurz said she didn't think anything of it when she saw a maintenance truck in the library's parking lot

'[She] turned around and saw two other employees engaged in sexual intercourse on the floor in the children's section,' Kurz's attorney, Joseph Campbell, told KRQE.

Kurz identified the two as her boss, the head librarian, and a maintenance worker - both of whom, she says, are married to other people.

Kurz says the maintenance worker told her to not say anything about the incident to anyone. But she did - Kurz took her complaint to the city library director, and ultimately to Estancia's Mayor Sylvia Chavez.

'The mayor subsequently talked to Jamie about it, told her that it wouldn't have any effect on her job,' Campbell says.

However, after the head librarian returned to work, she complained that Kurz was creating a hostile work environment and she was fired, presumably at the directive of the mayor.

The library director also was fired.

On October 10, Chavez sent Kurz a termination letter explaining that her firing was the result of her failure to turn over a library key while she was on leave.

'our refusal to turn over Town property upon request and as required to 
ensure uninterrupted library services shows a lack of cooperation and 
willingness to work with supervisors,' wrote Chavez in the letter. 'This
behavior constitutes insubordination and jeopardizes the Town's ability
to serve its citizens.'

Campbell, however, claims Kurz was fired in an attempt to sweep the incident with the head librarian and the maintenance worker under the rug - according to Campbell, the unidentified couple are locals who are 'close' with the mayor.

In a recorded conversation between Kurz and the head librarian - made in attempt to corroborate Kurz's claim - the librarian doesn't actually admit to having sex in the children's section, but does tell Kurz that 'if she can't handle the situation, [she] should find another job,' according to KRQE, which listended to the recording.

Campbell says that the mayor's actions could result in him firing a whistleblower lawsuit on Kurz behalf.
