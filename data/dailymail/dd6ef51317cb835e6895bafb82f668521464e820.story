A fast-moving coastal storm is forecast to blast several major cities in the Northeast with a mix of snow, sleet and rain on Saturday all along the busy I-95 corridor.

The biggest snowfall amounts are expected in southern New England, but forecasters warned that temperatures hovering near freezing could make for slippery driving conditions across the region.

The approaching storm is also likely to plummet in pressure, leading to strong winds which will drive the snow and sleet.

If the drop in pressure equals of exceeds 24milibars within 24 hours the storm will then meet the technical definition for a weather bomb - in a process known as bombogenesis.

'It's kind of the first one, so it's a good thing it's happening this weekend,' National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Simpson in Taunton, Massachusetts, said Friday.

'If this happened during a weekday, it could be really slow and messy.' 

According to the Weather Channel, sleet and snow will begin to hit Washington, D.C., and southern Pennsylvania on Friday night.

By Saturday morning, a mixture of sleet and snow is expected to be falling in all major cities from D.C. as high as Portland, Maine - including New York City.

As the day warms up slightly, some places could see snow in the morning, sleet in the daytime, then snow in the evening again.

The fiercest snow is predicted for Rhode Island, Maine and the Massachusetts coast around Boston.

A winter storm warning was issued Friday for a large portion of central Pennsylvania ahead of the storm.

Forecasters said the area from Gettysburg to Johnstown, stretching from West Virginia through Maryland to just south of State College and Williamsport, could get 5 to 8 inches of snow between Friday night and Saturday afternoon.

Some predictions also say New York City, Porland and parts of Connecticut could face eight inches. 

The Maryland State Highway Administration warned motorists that travel may become hazardous. The agency said it would have salt, snowplows and chain saws at the ready in case of fallen trees.

By Sunday, forecasters say the storm is likely to have headed out into the Atlantic once more. 

After a relatively tame start to the winter, Connecticut has plenty of salt and snow-treatment chemicals stockpiled around the state and a fleet of 632 plow trucks ready to go, Department of Transportation spokesman Kevin Nursick said.

He said crews have been pre-treating some highways and bridges, but there already is some salt leftover from recent, smaller storms.

'We don't need to go full tilt,' he said.

The storm is expected to begin as snow across much of the region, with areas east of I-95 receiving mostly rain.

Forecasters say accumulation amounts will depend on how quickly the rain line moves west. The weather service said the Philadelphia area could receive as much as a quarter-inch of ice Saturday morning before the rain arrives.

Meteorologist Peter Wichrowski in Upton, New York, said snow likely would start to fall in New York City in the early morning hours of Saturday, with a mix of rain and maybe a little sleet along the coastal areas. He said snowfall totals were expected to be around 1 to 2 inches across eastern Long Island.

Baltimore and Washington were expected to get only rain as temperatures hover just above freezing.
