Well respected: Law professor Dan Markel' death has understandably stunned his close friends and family - shocked that the prominent scholar was shot dead in his home in a suspected 'targeted' killing

The chilling murder of Dan Markel in the upmarket Tallahassee suburb of Betton Hills has baffled police and stunned family and friends who claim the loving father-of-two had no enemies to speak of and had just begun a new relationship after a painful divorce.

Shot at point blank range inside his own garage with the car keys still inside his black Honda Accord, the Harvard and Cambridge-educated law professor's death has left authorities struggling to comprehend who would want him dead.

Indeed, just 36-hours before he met his killer, 41-year-old Markel's thoughts were firmly fixed on his most passionate cause, the death penalty, posting an essay on the subject to his legal blog.

Questioning
 the acceptable rate of errors in death penalty cases, Markel's piece 
was posted to his widely read PrawfsBlawg on the evening of July 16.

At
 11am on July 18, Markel was shot in the head after being 'targeted' 
according to Tallahassee police - raising the truly frightening prospect
 that he was the subject of a contract killing.

Their investigation is centered around a Toyota Prius seen driving away from the scene by a neighbor.

But what could have led to the murder of man who seemed to have only friends?

Intentional?  Dan Markel had posted a passionate
 essay on the death penalty two nights before he was shot inside his 
Tallahassee home

Having
 sailed through academia from the Ivy League to England and back to 
Harvard Law School, where he edited the prestigious Harvard Law Review, Markel's intellect was dedicated to the improvement of the nation's legal system.

On
 landing a job as assistant law professor at Florida State University, 
Markel met Wendi Adelson, who was in her third year as a student at the 
University of Miami.

Like
 Markel, she had been educated at Cambridge University and soon the two 
married - Markel proposing on a hill overlooking the Sea of Galilee.

In a touching post to his blog on their union, Markel wrote, 'All I can say is: Wow, did I win the lottery of life?'

The
 ambitious couple's wedding announcement made the New York Times and he 
continued to be a rising star at Florida State University - where he 
launched his popular PrawfsBlawg - a forum for legal experts to discuss 
contentious theories and issues.

Shot dead: Detectives say Florida State University law school professor Daniel Markel was shot in the head inside his garage at home in Tallahassee, Florida last Friday

'Dan was a connecter,' said Paul Horwitz, a University of Alabama law professor who participated in the blog.

'He made many friends and maintained an astounding number of friendships. In person and on his blog, he introduced many people to each other and created whole new communities,' said the professor to the Miami Herald.

A strong opponent of the death penalty, he achieved national prominence and wrote for Slate and the New York Times.

The scholar, who was buried in his hometown of Toronto on Thursday, had his critics though.

According to the Miami Herald,
 Markel was the subject of an anonymous threatening post, that taken out
 of context can seem ominous, but in fact was only a small part of a 
wider academic argument.

'Bullies
 like this need to be made radioactive,' writes the poster, annoyed at 
perceived deletion of posts by Markel on PrawfsBlawg.

Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father

Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013

'Their arrogance and imperiousness speaks for itself. All means necessary must be employed.'

According to the Miami Herald, a Florida State spokeswoman would not confirm or deny whether Markel reported this to the university.

Described as a devoted father to his two sons, Benjamin, five and Lincoln, four, Markel was called 'Abba' by them, Hebrew for father.

'The house was like a playpen,' said one of his students, Ryan Wechsler to the Miami Herald.

'The living room was just for the kids. There were toys on the floor, crayon drawings all over the walls. You could tell he loved being a father.'

Indeed, by all accounts, the fiercely 
intelligent scholar's most important struggle to date was no different 
from many others - that of a father trying to keep his family together.

Markel's happy home was turned upside down in September 2012 when Adelson filed for divorce.

As the case moved through the courts, Markel's attorney's claimed that their client was stunned and that Adelson had upped and left the home with their children while he was away for a short business trip.

'This abrupt and cruel departure shocked Mr. Markel, who, in a six-year marriage unmarked by any abuse, addiction or infidelity, was devoted to his wife and children,' his attorneys wrote.

'For six weeks, Ms. Adelson gave no correct information regarding where she lived with the children.'

According to the Miami Herald, Adelson tried to move south from her job as a professor, also at Florida State University, to a private law firm.

A judge denied this and their custody issues were still ongoing at the time of his death.

For her part, Adelson, through her attorney's has spoken of her total and absolute shock at the death of her ex-husband.

Indeed, the unexplained and clinical nature of the murder has reportedly left her frightened for her safety and that of her children.

according to his friends who have been left bewildered and scared by

Her attorney, Jimmy Judkins has said Adelson is in 'shock' and reiterated that she knew nothing of the killing and had spoken to police already.

'She is probably more curious about what happened than anybody because while the police said he was targeted, at one time, it was her house, too,' he said to the Miami Herald.

'It’s just discomforting to her. She’s worried for her children.'

New York University law professor Rick Hills told the Toronto Star that he last saw Markel when he came to stay in Manhattan two weeks before his death.

Hills revealed that the Markel was moving on in his life and was now happy in a new relationship with a woman after going through his divorce.

'He was rebuilding his life after a really, really difficult period,' Hills said.

'I was watching him as he was in my apartment Skyping his kids and saying goodnight on his cellphone … he was so happy.'
