It was also the place Harry’s parents made their final stand before being slain by Lord Voldemort, immortalising the house as the backdrop where Harry wizard received his characteristic scar.

Astonishingly the home has become the second most photographed doorway in the whole of the UK, with only number 10 Downing Street pipping it to the top spot.

The beautiful medieval building includes a reception hall, drawing room, dining room., kitchen/breakfast room, laundry room, three double bedrooms, two bathrooms and an attic room.

The five star self-catering wing features a reading room, sitting room, kitchen/breakfast room, shower room and two double bedroom suites.

Guests who stay at the house can’t resist watching clips of the famous Harry Potter movies to help make the magic feel more real.

Current owner of the house Jane Ranzetta said: 'It’s part of Godric’s Hollow. The house can be seen opposite the graveyard, with a Christmas tree in the window, the lights on and music coming out of it.'

Her husband Tony Ranzetta said: 'It was really quite extraordinary watching both the filming and then the end result on screen.

'The crew arrived without actors and filmed both the front and the back in the height of summer.

'They then used parts of the house like pieces of a massive three dimensional jigsaw, cutting and pasting them to form the streets of Godric’s Hollow

'They even made the final result a snow scene in the winter, with a Christmas tree in our front window and carol singing coming from within the house.'

De Vere House, which has also been known as the de Vere Hunting Lodge, Oxford House and Oxford Cottages over the years, was owned by the powerful de Vere family from the 14th to 17th centuries.

It also includes the remains of one of the last garde-robes to be installed in this country, a rare and original medieval wall painting, and a magnificent front door-way.

Jane, a private tutor, said: 'We have been here for 22 or 23 years and it feels like the time has come for us to leave.

'I never think you own a house like this, you are just custodians and that is an honour.'

The current owners, who have a 15-year-old son, first spotted the magical building more than two decades ago during a day trip to Lavenham.

Since they bought it, the Ranzettas have lovingly restored the house and gardens, uncovering ornate decorations, including carvings and mediaeval paintings.

Jane added: 'We had seen the house several times and taken photos and thought, ‘What a lovely house,’ but also that it would never come on the market.

'A few months later we were looking for a property and we were sent details od De Vere House.

'It sounds cliched but we knew we wanted it as soon as we walked through the door.'

During De Vere House’s extraordinary past King Henry VII visited in 1498, historians believe.
