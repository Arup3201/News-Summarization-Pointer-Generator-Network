A mother-of-two was was forced to spend her dying days moving house to get drugs that could have prolonged her life, her devastated family say.

Emma Chalk was yet another victim of the postcode lottery apartheid between England and Wales, where patients in Wales are often refused drugs they would be entitled to if they lived over the border in England.

Mrs Chalk, 46, lived in Flintshire, North Wales, less than five miles from Chester - where the drug pomalidomide to treat her terminal cancer would have been available on the NHS. 

Despite even having a Chester postcode, she was forced to hunt for a flat with husband Len, 49, instead of being treated for bone marrow cancer.

She died on November 11, three weeks after securing a flat that cost £400 a month.

Emma Chalk (with husband Len, daughter Amy and son Lenny) was denied a life-extending cancer drug because she lived in Wales. Had she lived five miles away, over the English border, she would have got it

Mr and Mrs Chalk had been forced to hunt for a flat in England instead of her being treated for bone marrow cancer. She died on November 11, three weeks after securing a flat that cost £400 a month

The  couple spent a total of £1,500 on the flat, which included a deposit, bond and the first month's rent.

Mrs Clark, who worked for the NHS at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, had been battling cancer for 11 years. 

She was suffering from myeloma, also known as multiple myeloma - a cancer arising from cells made in the bone marrow.  

The former NHS nurse underwent two stem cell transplants, but died last month at the Countess of Chester Hospital.

She had been having maintenance chemotherapy and the drug pomalidomide had shown it could extend her life by a number of months.

As a result, her oncologist complied a 56-page document asking for Emma to be granted the drug.

He presented the report to the All Welsh Medicine Strategy Group, an advisory body on medicinal usage in Wales, but the panel refused the treatment.  

Mrs Chalk's husband Len, an ex-Army Warrant Officer who was married to his wife for 25 years, has blasted officials for 'playing God' with his wife's life.

He said: 'I realise that there aren't endless pots of money - but what price are they putting on life?

'We live 4.5 miles away from the English/Welsh border.

'Instead of spending crucial moments together, we were looking for flats.

'Emma was lying in the hospital alongside people who could have the treatment and had been given the treatment yet she couldn't because she lived in a different postcode to them.

'This drug was put on the table before hospital treatment even started - but it was taken away from us because of a postcode.'

He added: 'I believe the Welsh government are partaking in selective euthanasia - they are choosing who lives and who dies.'

Mr Chalk said: 'Emma was an amazing mother and lived for her kids - it's crazy how she's been treated'

He said it was his wife's aim in life to see the couple's two children Len, 18, who suffers from learning disabilities, and Amy, 14, through to adulthood.

Mr Chalk said: 'Emma was an amazing mother and lived for her kids.

'Thankfully, my daughter Amy has been my rock. She's been absolutely fantastic. Len has his own way of dealing with it but he's aware of what's happened.

'It's crazy how she's been treated. 'They were caring for her and then when the treatment came along they said no.

'They just cut her off.'

A spokesperson from the All Welsh Medicine Strategy Group said: 'Pomalidomide was not proven to be cost effective on the evidence presented.

'So it wasn't made available to the NHS in Wales and wasn't recommended for patient use.

'We cannot comment on individual cases.'
