Suddenly Frankie Dettori’s world doesn’t seem so bad.

Six days after losing the ride on Arc favourite Treve at the request of trainer Criquette Head-Maarek, the Italian sat in the Weighing Room as the 2013 winner could finish fourth to Baltic Baroness in the Group One Prix Vermeille and her odds of landing a back-to-back Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe drifted to 10-1 with Ladbrokes.

Quite what facial impression Dettori wore as events unfold can only be guessed at but it can’t have been as grim as that of his replacement Thierry Jarnet.

Adding to the bounce in the Dettori step was not only a win in the Prix Du Petit Couvert on Rae Guest’s Mirza but also that he still looks to have decent chance of an Arc ride, either with his Group Two Prix Foy winner Ruler Of the World or Ectot, impressive winner of the Prix Niel.

For the latter to happen Ectot’s jockey Gregory Benoit will have to choose to partner his unbeaten French Oaks winner Avenir Certain but the bookmaker’s verdict indicate it will be a tough choice.

Coral have Ectot, who was a 16-1 shot going into the Niel and hadn’t run since April in an injury-disrupted season, sharing Arc favouritism at 5-1 with Avenir Certain.

Dettori’s boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani is only joint owner of Ectot and Ruler Of The World and cannot dictate jockey plans but there is bound to be pressure behind the scenes to get his No 1 jockey a ride.

After partnering Ruler of The World to a length and a half win from Flintshire, the Aidan O’Brien-trained colt’s first success since last year’s Derby, Dettori said: ‘Aidan gave me a bundle of confidence. I hope he might be my Arc ride but it is out of my hands. I have to see what everyone else does.

‘Treve was exactly like Ascot. Last year I was having a job holding her, she was that good. Today she was not moving the same and you have seen the result.’

Treve, racing for the first time since Royal Ascot, seems to have lost her zip and has lost all three runs this season.

Head-Maarek, however, insisted: ‘She needed that run - don’t rule her out.’

With German Derby winner Sea The Moon ruled out of the Arc over the weekend, the latest trials also strengthened the position of King George and Oaks winner Taghrooda.

She is 5-1 and committed to the race after being season was put forward as a reason for her Yorkshire Oaks defeat last month.

Saturday’s St Leger winner Kingston Hill is 10-1 for the Arc. His trainer Roger Varian and jockey Andrea Atzeni also won yesterday’s Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh with Cursory Glance.
