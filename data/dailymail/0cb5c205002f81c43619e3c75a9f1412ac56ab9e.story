Spanish bus driver Ariano Lopez could be facing the sack after he was spotted using WhatsApp while driving passengers between Barcelona's airport and the city centre.

Mr Lopez even refused to stop when passengers complained about him using his mobile phone as he drove the shuttle bus through the traffic on the busy main road.

The footage was recorded by a passenger on the Aerobus service that connects Terminal 1 of Barcelona's El Prat airport with Placa Catalunya in the heart of the city in north-eastern Spain.

The bus was said to be completely of passengers.

One of those on board spotted the driver not paying attention to the road and began to record him as he began to engage in a text chat on his phone. 

The footage catches the driver only occasionally glancing up at the road, and with just one hand on the wheel, between reading and sending messages on the WhatsApp messaging service. 

'Regrettable' incident:  Manel Plasensia from the bus company said the driver would face consequences

The head of communications for the bus company SGMT, Manel Plasensia, described the incident as 'regrettable' and 'unusual', and added that it was not to be tolerated and that the driver would face consequences.

'This behaviour is considered as serious misconduct in our driver manual,' he said, and apologised to the passengers who had felt put at risk by the action.

SGMT confirmed it has opened disciplinary proceedings against the driver.
