There has been tension on the set of the talk show The View for months now.

And it looks like things may come to a head sooner rather than later, according to a Monday report from TMZ, as Rosie O'Donnell is again pegged as a troublemaker on the set of the ABC show.

'Executives doubt she will even finish the season,' a source told the site. Rosie's rep has denied the report.

More reports of bad blood on set: On Monday TMZ claimed that Rosie O'Donnell, pictured in September, may not last the entire season of The View as she has been 'rude' and a 'malcontent' on the show

Among the complaints about the 52-year-old personality is that she is a 'malcontent' who is 'bringing down' the show.

And with the ratings for the afternoon chat fest on a steady decline, no one wants to put up with her reportedly unpleasant behavior.

O'Donnell's reported bad attitude allegedly comes from her unhappiness that she is not in charge of the hosts. Rather it is Whoopi Goldberg who is the key 'moderator.'

All smiles here: The hosts, which include (from left) Whoopi Goldberg, Nicolle Wallace, and Rosie Perez, have not gelled well, according to several reports, and the ratings are not good either

The site claims that does not sit well with the League Of Her Own actress.

'Rosie came in thinking she'd be in the lead position at the table, the moderator,' a source has said.

'She was outraged when it became clear the title and the power belonged to Whoopi.'

Other hosts on the show include Rosie Perez and Nicolle Wallace.

This has left O'Donnell 'depressed' and not in the mood to chat with other people on the show, it was claimed.

It has also been reported that executives have tried to reason with the outspoken TV fixture, but it's like 'talking to a wall,' said a source.

'She is impossible to deal with,' an insider told TMZ. 'She is rude both on and off camera.'

ABC has yet to address claims of strife on set and there has been no suggestion that The View hosts will depart.

But the source has insisted that Rosie does not have another season in her. 'It's out of the question,' the insider has said.

Problem? What problem?: The League Of Her Own actress' rep has said she has no issue with Whoopi

O'Donnell's rep told TMZ, 'This is absolutely false. Whoopi Goldberg has been the moderator since Whoopi was hired and Rosie knew that before she took the job.'

In late November Rosie and Whoopi argued about Bill Cosby and whether his sexual assault accusers had any merit.

O'Donnell has yet to address reports that she is not liked on the show and is instead going about her business.

On Monday the brunette posted a photo of a child on top of a pit bull. 'Baby and pitbull !!! #2CUTE,' she wrote, seemingly not fazed that the breed of dog has a history of violence against children.
