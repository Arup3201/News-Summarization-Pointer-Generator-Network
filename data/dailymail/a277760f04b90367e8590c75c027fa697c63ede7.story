Luis Suarez chewed up and spat out Manchester City with a deadly double but the Barcelona striker found himself at the centre of a fresh bite row as  Twitter users suggested he had a nibble of Martin Demichelis.

Suarez’s first-half goals have Barca in the driving seat ahead of the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie  but it was his actions at the end of the 2-1 win that threatened to overshadow his classy finishing.

The 90 minutes had come and gone when the former Liverpool star ran across Demichelis and as the City defender’s arm flicks towards Suarez, he appears to move his head down to meet it. Did he try another bite?

At first, it looked like Suarez was moving his mouth towards Demichelis' hand. However, another vine posted on the social media site appeared to show the Uruguay international attempt to run past the Man City defender's outstretched arm.

One Twitter user, @Zachsadri posted: '(sic) Pretty sure Suarez tried to bite Demichelis here.. Not again.'

There was no reaction from Demichelis or his City team-mates but we all know Suarez, who cost Barcelona £75million from Liverpool, has history. 

Before the Reds shelled out £22m for the Uruguayan, Suarez had already developed a 'bad-boy' reputation with Ajax in Holland.

His play-acting antics were one thing, but in November 2010, a new side to the forward was born. As PSV and Ajax players scrapped off the ball, Suarez chomped down on opposing midfielder Otman Bakkal's shoulder.

No red card followed, but a seven-match ban meant he never played in the Eredivise again. And then Liverpool entered the fray.

Suarez had already been given an eight-match ban after being charged with racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra during a Premier League game in 2011, before biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in a  2013 fixture.

He went on to score the equaliser but after that, his reputation was set in the eyes of the British public, and press.

'His behaviour is not befitting of any player wearing a Liverpool shirt,' chief executive Ian Ayre said.

Brendan Rodgers added: 'Players are always replaceable, it does not matter how good they think they are.'

Suarez strongly denied the accusations of racism against Evra, but had no choice but to apologise after the incident with Ivanovic. He had lost his temper, and inexcusably bitten the Serbian defender's shoulder.

The FA handed out a 10-game ban to Suarez, who then tried to angle a move away from Anfield. Arsenal laid down £35m to give the striker a fresh start, but Liverpool rejected the bid and placed their trust in his ability.

They weren't wrong, as Suarez went on to net 31 goals and become the top scorer in the 2013/14 Premier League season despite missing the first five games. He almost lead the Reds to the title, and a summer switch to some of the world's best was again mooted.

Suarez went to the 2014 World Cup as a man reborn. Full of confidence, named the PFA and FWA Player of the Year in England, even scoring the goal to all-but knock out Roy Hodgson's side in Brazil. However, he was about to return to the centre of attention for all the wrong reasons.

The prolific star first said he 'lost his balance' when appearing to bite Italy's Giorgio Chiellini in Uruguay's final group stage game. Again, his side went on to score a crucial late goal. 

Chiellini protested to the referee, lowering his shirt to present bite marks on his shoulder as the pair clashed in the box as a cross came in.

The third bite in his professional career earned him a nine-game ban from world football, his eventual statement apologising to the defender was similar to that of the sorrow he expressed to Ivanovic.

'The truth is that my colleague Giorgio Chiellini suffered the physical result of a bite in the collision he suffered with me,' said Suarez.

'I deeply regret what occurred.' I apologise to Giorgio Chiellini and the entire football family. I vow to the public that there will never again be another incident like this.'

He was banned for four months, but Barcelona still spent a club record fee to bring him to the Nou Camp.

Suarez revealed he had been seeing a therapist in Barcelona as he looked to prevent a further incident from happening.

'I think all the bad things I have been through are in the past,' Suarez told the Guardian before his return to action in October. 'I believe I am on the right path now, dealing with the people who can help me, the right kind of people.

His form in recent weeks as he has seamlessly fitted into Luis Enrique's side has been impressive. His performance against City in the Champions League last-16 first leg was sublime. Joe Hart had no chance with the two goals.

But has he tarnished that reputation further after clashing with Demichelis?
