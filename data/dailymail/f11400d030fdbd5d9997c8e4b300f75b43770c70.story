The extent to which government and insurance companies have fleeced motorists for years was laid bare yesterday.

Research by the House of Commons Library found that the cost of vehicle tax and insurance has more than doubled over the past 25 years – even when inflation is taken into account.

The combined cost is now a whopping 117 per cent higher in real terms than it was in 1987.

War: The figures were condemned by Tory MP Robert Halfon, who blamed 'trendy, anti-car green policies'

Motorists face annual bills of up to £490 for vehicle excise duty, when it was just £100 a quarter of a century ago.

And insurance costs – an average of £280 in 1987 – are now £652 for fully comprehensive and £1,057 for third-party, fire and theft.

The study also found that petrol and oil costs have soared by 64 per cent over the same period.

Much of the cost is taken up by fuel duty imposed by government – a levy that is among the highest in Europe.

To add to the burden still further, car maintenance costs have gone up by 57 per cent.

The research reveals that the only expense to have reduced in recent years is the cost of buying a car in the first place. 

Vehicles are now, on average, less than half the price they were in 1987 in real terms.

Fleeced: The cost of taxing and insuring vehicles has more than doubled in the past 25 years

Tory MP Robert Halfon, a transport campaigner, said the figures confirmed that motorists are being hard hit because of ‘trendy, anti-car green policies’ imposed by politicians.

He called on the Chancellor to reduce both vehicle excise duty and fuel duty to help hard-pressed drivers.

‘Motorists are amongst the most hammered taxpayers in Britain,’ he said. ‘Wherever they look, they are hit by one charge or another – whether it is the high cost of fuel, insurance charges, vehicle excise duty or speed cameras.

‘Enough is enough. This is hurting families and businesses. We need radical reform to look at how Britain can afford to get motoring again.

‘We’ve had a culture of environmentalism for the chattering classes who forget about families who need their car to pick their children up from school, and businesses who rely on their car for their living. Cars are a symbol of freedom and shouldn’t be taxed out of existence. I think the Government should be looking at road tolls as long as it guarantees that vehicle excise duty and fuel duty will be reduced.’

Vehicle excise duty was a flat rate of £100 a year in 1987.

Now it is charged at a rate depending on a car’s emissions – zero for the least-polluting cars and £490 for the most polluting.

The first-year rate for cars in the top band is £1,065.

The Commons Library said average car insurance rates were around £280 in 1987 – but are now often four-figure sums.

The rise is put down to the fact that there are now more younger drivers – insurance companies  will charge more for third-party insurance because they perceive applicants as a higher risk – and because of a sharp increase in personal injury claims, particularly  whiplash cases.

RAC spokesman Simon Williams described the rises in fuel prices as ‘shocking’.

‘The price rise is not just down to inflation and changes in the oil industry, it’s also very much down to the incredible rise in fuel duty charged by the government,’ he said.

A spokesman for the AA said: ‘Drivers have felt for many years that they are an easy target for whichever government, local authority or business has wanted to maximise its take.’
