A mother who suffered two miscarriages today thanked TV presenter Phillip Schofield for 'saving' the life of her miracle baby.

Shelley Wilkinson, 34, had lost two daughters due to a weak cervix when she unexpectedly fell pregnant again.

But as she reacted with fear to the possibility of losing a third child, her husband Andrew, 34, recalled an item he watched on ITV1’s This Morning, presented by host Schofield, about a rarely used 'bionic band' procedure for mothers-to-be.

Overjoyed: Shelley Wilkinson and her husband Andrew with baby Lyla. Mrs Wilkinson had lost two babies due to a weak cervix when she fell pregnant again. But Mr Wilkinson recalled an item he watched on ITV1's This Morning about a rarely used 'bionic band' procedure

Just days later Mrs Wilkinson had a consultation at Liverpool Women’s Hospital - within 48 hours she went under the knife for a transabdominal cervical cerclage, a stitching procedure which has been given to less than 150 women in the region.

The operation involves fitting a ‘bionic band’ over the neck of the cervix, keeping it shut during pregnancy, protecting the foetus from infection and lowering the chances of miscarriage.

The procedure was a success and after resting through the remainder of her pregnancy, Mr and Mrs Wilkinson’s dreams came true when Lyla was born on August 23.

Now the happy couple have taken Layla home to Chorley, Lancashire, where she was introduced to her six-year-old big brother Josh.

Mrs Wilkinson, a care assistant, today said: 'Lyla’s just perfect, my little miracle - and its thanks to This Morning that I found out about saving her.

'I can’t describe what it was like to hold her for the first time. Andrew and I have been through a lot of despair losing two babies and we just felt joyful to have Lyla with us, healthy and gorgeous.

'The help and support we’ve had from 
Liverpool Women’s Hospital and the midwives have been brilliant and I’d 
just like to say to expectant mothers who experience problems that help 
is out there.

'It just took us a bit of luck by watching Phillip Schofield to find it.'

Mrs Wilkinson had been diagnosed with having a weak cervix and as a result her waters twice broke at 22 weeks, in 2008 and then 2010, losing daughters Chloe and Olivia respectively.

After the second tragedy Mrs Wilkinson was told her cervix wasn’t strong enough to hold a baby to full term and she was so traumatised that she told her husband she never wanted to have another baby.

So last year, when Mrs Wilkinson discovered she was pregnant again she instantly fell to pieces with all the horrors of what had happened rushing back.

She said: 'When I fell pregnant again we had mixed feelings as it was very likely to happen again.

'But Andrew remembered seeing something on This Morning about a woman who told how she had undergone an operation in which her womb was tied to prevent the baby from coming too early.

'He thought that procedure could help us and I asked for a referral to Liverpool Women’s Hospital.

'It was a bit of a whirlwind but after talking to the consultant I knew it would give my baby the best chance. It was even more delicate because I was eight weeks gone and ideally the operation should happen before pregnancy.'

A spokeswoman for Liverpool Women’s Hospital said: ‘The synthetic band, known as a transabdominal cerclage is like a band of steel which is placed at the neck of the womb.

'It has a 95 per cent success rate but is only carried out at a handful of centres in the UK.'

A spokesman for ITV1’s This Morning said: 'It’s always great to hear from viewers of the show, but to know that the programme helped Shelley and Andrew with such a precious gift of a baby is just fantastic.'
