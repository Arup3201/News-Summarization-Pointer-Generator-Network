It is widely considered to be the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution and a proud testament to a time when Britain led the way in new technology and engineering.

And now the Ironbridge Gorge, which has been under threat from landslides for the last few years, will still be around for generations to come after being awarded a multimillion-pound grant.

The World Heritage site consists of 18th century iron works, huge kilns and even a Victorian town surrounded by the natural beauty of the Shropshire landscape.

The gorge has been dubbed the 'cradle of the Industrial Revolution' by many historians and described by writer Charles Hulbert in 1837 as 'the most extraordinary district in the world'.

According to the Daily Telegraph, communities secretary Eric Pickles will today announce a £12million grant to 'preserve Ironbridge Gorge’s place in history as one of the world’s great symbols and a site of outstanding beauty for generations to come'.

Mr Pickles will say later today: 'It is vital that we do not let places like Ironbridge Gorge deteriorate or slide out of sight.

'The picturesque 18th century Ironbridge Gorge stands as a monument to modernity and the industrial revolution - a testament to British ingenuity and ambition that has been universally protected as a World Heritage Site for all to marvel at.'

The money will be spent on protecting the various monuments in the gorge and to repair cracking to the bridge caused by the constantly shifting river banks. The bridge - the first iron bridge of its kind in the world - has required significant maintenance since it was first built in 1779.

The location of the bridge was chosen because East Shropshire was an important industrial area because of the huge coal deposits near the surface.

The Ironbridge Gorge was made a Unesco world heritage site in 1986 - putting it alongside the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, the Great Wall of China and the Pyramids in Egypt in terms of its historical importance.

The Gorge and its ten museums spread along the valley by the River Severn attract 500,000 visitors every year bringing £20million to the local economy of Telford and Wrekin and the wider Shropshire area.
