The mother of the model police say was beaten and stabbed to death by former Hi-Five singer Russell Neal says the killing 'took her heart.'

Catherine Martinez, 24, was found brutally murdered in the apartment she shared with Neal, 40, after he walked into a Texas police station and said his wife was dead. This is the first time her family has spoken since the grisly discovery.

'If you seeing this, just remember you took a part of my life, part of my heart,' a devastated Catherine Figueroa, Martinez's mother, told KTRK between tears.

The grieving woman called her dead daughter 'my bonita,' which is Spanish for beautiful, and claimed Neal was violent towards her.

'He was abusive the whole time and I keep telling my daughter leave it alone, let it go,' Figueroa insisted.

Sister Glenda Lewis could not stop crying.

'They just keep saying she might have been lifeless for days, that was my sister,' she shouted while wiping away tears.

The former member of chart-topping 1990s boy band was arrested Wednesday after bursting into a Texas police station and telling police his wife was dead and he needed a lawyer.

Authorities found 24-year-old Catherine Martinez, who has two sons, dead from apparent stab wounds and blunt force trauma. Neal is currently in custody on a $100,000 bond.

Sad fall: Russell Neal, far right, performed as part of the 90s R&B boy band Hi-Five, which had two major hits including I Like the Way (the Kissing Game), which went to number 1 in 1991. He's now charged with murdering his 24-year-old wife

According to KHOU, Neal told police he'd gotten into an argument with Martinez before he asked for an attorney and then clammed up.

A witness described the exceptionally docile scene to KTRK.

'He wasn't resisting arrest or fighting with them, or saying anything. When they brought him out in handcuffs, he was just as calm as can be and they just put him in a police car,' said Mary Alice Valencia, who works at a nearby bond office and is accustomed to seeing arrests.

Facebook user Wayne Head was in the police station when Neal entered and took photos of the former singer.

Head appears to claim in his error-filled post that Neal went so far as to admit he killed Martinez.

'[Neal] walk n an say he just killed his wife she at home deveased,' wrote Head.

Neighbors described the couple as seemingly happy, but one man speculated there was more than met the eye.

'Apparently a guilty conscience, a guilty conscience, a crime of passion,' neighbor Keenon Shufford told KTRK. 'You just never know, I think he just probably lost it.'

Martinez was described by neighbors as very beautiful and in fact she has a substantial internet presence from her work as a fitness model and aspiring boxer under the name Brasilia Martinez.

In a May interview with Mxymag, the up and coming young model admits her 'biggest flaw is being too caring.'

She had two sons who would sometimes be seen in the apartment complex, though it was unclear if the boys are Neal's.

In the Mxymag interview, Martinez calls them her 'princes.'

'I love my two princes, my family, and the loyal and hon­est peo­ple in my life,' she said.

A photographer who worked with Martinez posted a striking photo of her along with this message on Instagram:

'Still
 can't believe this but RIP @brasiliamartinez1990 gone way too soon . 
One of the realist people i knew with a strong work ethic and dope 
personality. Thank you for believing in me,' wrote D. Hinez.

Police said the children are now with family members.
