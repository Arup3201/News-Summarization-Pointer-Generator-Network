It is the final that Africa has been anticipating for a decade.

On one side stand the last remnants of the ‘golden generation’, the most talented squad the continent has ever produced.

On the other are a group of players that won the 2009 U-20 World Cup, were just a Luis Suarez hand-ball from being the most successful African nation at a World Cup, and should now be in their prime.

And yet, it is a final that, before the tournament, next to no-one would have predicted. They may both have been perennial favourites for the past ten years, but coming into this Cup of Nations, both teams were in disarray.

The Ivorians, for all their big names, had conceded 11 times in six qualifying games.

Without the talismanic Didier Drogba for the first major tournament since 2002, there was a real feeling that their best chance of ending a trophy drought that now spans more than two decades had gone.

Even less was expected of Ghana. Despite the undoubted talent in their squad, qualifying was a shambles. The Black Stars took just one point from two games against Uganda, and needed a late goal to edge past Togo.

They only appointed manager Avram Grant a matter of weeks before the tournament, and the decision was greeted with derision by many in African football.

Grant has never before managed on the continent, and was seen as merely a big name, brought in with little hope of securing a first major title in 33 years.

But both sides have defied expectation, and, after a slow start, developed into resilient teams.

Of the two, Ghana have been the more exciting. Christian Atsu, the Chelsea winger struggling to get games on loan at Everton, has, in flashes at least, been brilliant. His goal against Guinea could well be the best of the tournament, whether he meant it or not.

Alongside him are surprise package Kwesi Appiah, nominally a Crystal Palace player but on loan at Cambridge United in League Two, and the tournament’s top scorer Andre Ayew.

Appiah’s rise in particular has been remarkable. A shock selection even to be picked in the squad, the League Two striker only made his Ghana debut in the tournament’s third game off the bench.

But after being handed a start in the knock-out stages the goals have started to come, and in the semi-final he was man of the match, winning a penalty and creating the third goal.

The fourth man in that attack on Sunday night, will, injury permitting, be Asamoah Gyan, a man who sums up this Ghana side.

Despite all his ability, he will always be remembered for a missed penalty against Uruguay in 2010. Now, far from his best, he is on the brink of finally realizing the dream of winning a major tournament.

Having endured a bout of malaria that kept him out of the tournament opener, and missing the semi-final after being kicked in the stomach by Naby Yattara, it would be just like Gyan to pop up with a winner on the biggest stage.

Gyan’s Ivorian equivalent is, undoubtedly, Yaya Toure. The Manchester City man is not the same player for his country as we see at club level and yet, despite a poor tournament personally, he could still lead his side to glory.

Playing as a holding midfielder Toure’s ability to influence games has been greatly diminished, but he still popped up with a thunderous strike to put his side ahead in the semi-final.

With team-mate Wilfried Bony ahead of him, and brother Kolo behind, the spine of the Ivorian side is as good as almost any international side in the world.

Yet Herve Renard has eschewed the attacking approach of previous managers, and has the team playing pragmatic football, utilizing the pace of Gervinho and Max Gradel on the break, while sitting deep and taking the sting out of the opposition.

It is a tactic that has worked thus far. Kolo Toure has been masterful in marshaling a three-man defence with two rookies, Wilfried Kanon and Eric Bailly. The attacking thrust has come from Paris St Germains’ wing-back Serge Aurier, and despite neither Yaya or Bony being near their best, as a collective the Ivorians look at their strongest for a decade.

It is all set up for a spectacular showdown. While off-field scenes have dominated the headlines following violence in Ghana’s semi-final against hosts Equatorial Guinea, Sunday night’s game has the potential to be a classic.

It may not be enough to distract the world from the shameful scenes of Thursday night, but, at least, this may be the final that an otherwise excellent tournament deserves.
