Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett has credited CEO Roger Ailes with saving his life as he struggled with alcoholism last year.

Jarrett first revealed his addiction after slurring during a broadcast in April 2014 and a few weeks later, just hours after leaving rehab, he was arrested for drunkenly swearing at an airport police officer in Minnesota - in an embarrassing debacle caught on camera.

But in an astonishing turnaround, the 59-year-old is now back in the Fox News anchor seat and healthier than ever - and he believes he has his boss to thank.

'Roger Ailes was the first person to step in and come to my rescue,' he told TV Newser. 'I don't want to sound overly dramatic, but I don't think I'd be here today if not for Roger.'

In the interview, Jarrett said Ailes, the chairman and CEO of Fox News, was the first person he admitted his addiction to following his meltdown on television last year.

Fox News later announced that Jarrett had stepped down from his role as anchor for 'personal reasons' and he went to a rehab facility in Minnesota.

But after checking out, he had an 'immediate relapse' and a bar employee at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport called police after he became unruly and started bothering another customer.

Footage of the arrest, which was released, shows him calling an officer a 'f***ing stupid ass' before the officer grabs his arm and forces his face against a wall, then slams him into the cell's bench.

After the altercation, he was taken to the Hennepin County Adult Detention Center in Minneapolis but was released after posting $300 bond the following day.

Thankful: Jarrett, pictured in his mug shot after his arrest last year, said Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, pictured left, helped him fight through his addiction and told him he would have a job to come back to

His mug shot and security footage showing the arrest were soon posted across the internet.

'When I saw the videotape, I was heartbroken,' Jarrett recalled. 'Because that's not me, that's not who I am. And yet, through alcoholism that's what I've become.'

But Ailes still refused to give up on Jarrett, telling him: 'We can beat this.'

The CEO assured the anchor that his job was safe and that he would continue to get paid, while also regularly checking in on his wife and their two daughters, Grace, 18, and Olivia, 16.

Thinking of what he put his daughters through, Jarrett told TV Newser: 'It breaks my heart.'

He also hired lawyers to handle Jarrett's case in Minnesota and got him admitted to the Betty Ford Center, while dispatching a Fox News producer to travel with him.

He left the clinic last August and started writing columns for FoxNews.com before reporting and eventually anchoring. Again, Ailes was there for him.

'He was the first to congratulate me when I came back on air, first as a reporter,' Jarrett said. 'He picked up the phone and said "you look great! You were fantastic! Good story. How do you feel?"'

Jarrett is now in a post-treatment program, which includes AA meetings, therapy and random alcohol testing, and continues to meet regularly with Ailes - and he's staying sober for him.

When he asked Ailes why he took so much care towards him, the CEO responded: 'Not only is it the Christian thing to do, but more importantly, it's the right thing to do,' Jarrett said.
