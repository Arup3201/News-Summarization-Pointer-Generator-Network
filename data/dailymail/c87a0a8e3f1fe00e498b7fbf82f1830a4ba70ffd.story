Jeremy Clarkson was forced to flee Argentina under police escort as furious protesters vowed to ‘barbecue’ him, it was revealed last night.

The Top Gear host was hounded out by Falklands War veterans after driving a car with the number plate H982 FKL – which they claim referred to the 1982 conflict.

He and fellow presenters Richard Hammond and James May fled their hotel after the lobby was invaded by angry ex-military personnel who told them to leave ‘or face the consequences’.

Staff told how the demonstrators shouted insults until they were removed by officers, forcing the crew to leave so hurriedly they forgot a computer.

The presenters then left for the nearest 
airport in order to catch the last flight to Buenos Aires, where they 
boarded another plane to Chile yesterday.

But other members of the 
BBC2 motoring show’s crew were pelted with stones by a jeering mob as 
they made their way to the border by road. All the cars used by the 
presenters had windows broken.

A number of vehicles were abandoned, 
including the Porsche with the controversial plate that Clarkson, 54, 
was driving in the southern province of Tierra del Fuego for a special 
edition of the show.

Abandoned: The presenters' cars were left by the side of the road before the crew fled to Chile

The 25-strong crew were saved from a 
second attack when they were smuggled by police and government officials
 down a remote route to the border.

Locals used social networking sites 
to comment on the convoy’s progress, with one posting the chilling 
message: ‘We’re going to make a barbecue with their meat on the border.’

Another said: ‘It looks like Jeremy Clarkson got a taste of his own
 medicine.’ And another labelled him a ‘British idiot’.

War veteran 
association member Osvaldo Hilliar said the crew had ignored strong 
‘local feeling’ about the Falklands.

Outspoken Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson has been involved in a string of controversies.

He was forced to apologise this year after it was claimed he mumbled the N-word while reciting a well-known children’s rhyme. 

In July, Ofcom ruled he deliberately used racist language by referring to an Asian man as a ‘slope’ during a Burma special.

The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC in 2012 about a special in which Clarkson travelled round India in a Jaguar with a toilet fixed to the boot.

Clarkson was also reported to have referred to the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown as a ‘one-eyed Scottish idiot’ in 2009. 

And the year before, the BBC received more than 500 complaints after he joked about lorry drivers murdering prostitutes.

Clarkson also made a mock Nazi salute while talking about a Mini design that might be ‘quintessentially German’ and received flak after describing those who jump in front of trains as ‘Johnny Suicides’.

Leading daily Clarin, predicting Clarkson was unlikely to come out unscathed, said: 'This is highly sensitive for Argentinians and he could have problems'

Today a local government official said the three presenters had flown to an undisclosed destination outside of Tierra del Fuego province

Hounded out: Jeremy Clarkson and his fellow Top Gear presenters have been forced to leave Argentina early after inciting outrage among local Falklands War veterans by driving a Porsche with the number plate H982 FKL

He added: ‘We told them we couldn’t guarantee their security if they didn’t leave.’ Despite claims by Top Gear that the choice of number plate was a coincidence, Argentine officials say it was a deliberate provocation.

Local mayor Gustavo Melella vowed to make an official protest to the British Embassy in Argentina. ‘We are peace-loving people but they’ve generated the initial violence by coming to our country in the way they have,’ he said. 

A BBC spokesman said last night: ‘We’re pleased the team is safe and would like to thank all of those who have helped.’

The presenters, as well as members of their film crew were pelted with stones. One of the team - a Argentinian technician - was reportedly injured after being hit in the face

Locals took to Twitter to gloat over the presenter's out-of-character surrender. One said: 'It looks like Jeremy Clarkson got a taste of his own medicine'

The Mirror reported that Clarkson had been warned not to cause a diplomatic incident, so the presenter responded with this tweet

Controversy: Clarkson (pictured earlier this year making a video apology for using the N-word while singing a racist rhyme for Top Gear) has provoked a backlash in the Argentinian media for using the number plate

The presenter had earlier tweeted about his hotel bar, saying 'I am going to f****** live here'
