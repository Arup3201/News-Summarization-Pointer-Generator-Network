Princess Beatrice's fashion choices have been making headlines recently, she even topped Vogue.com's best dressed list this month.

And the flame-haired Royal continued to showcase her style credentials as she holidayed in the South of France with her boyfriend this week.

Beatrice, who was bumped down the line of succession with Prince George's arrival, may be able to afford high-end designer clothes but the fashion-forward Royal reportedly opted for a £15 bikini from Life's A Beach.

She later covered up the simple blue halterneck bikini top and contrasting aquamarine frilled bottoms with a colourful kaftan and straw sun hat as she strolled happily along the beach.

Beatrice decided to gently ease herself in to the sea rather than follow her boyfriend's lead

The sixth in line to the throne is expected to meet the new prince - her cousin once removed - when Prince William and Kate make a special trip to Balmoral, where the Queen and Prince Philip spend the summer.

Beatrice looked relaxed as she chatted to her boyfriend on board their yacht and looked on as he made a spectacular dive in to the waters below.

She decided against doing the same, but looked confident and relaxed as she lowered herself into the sea after a little encouragement from Dave.

Beatrice was mortified by pictures of herself in a bikini during a 2008 holiday in St Bart's and embarked on a fitness regime which led to her running the London Marathon two years later.

Beatrice has been looking super 
stylish of late and using date nights with her boyfriend and nights on 
the town to put her new-found fashion choices and svelte figure to the test.

Her
 and her sister Eugenie's new look is down to the ‘Mary Poppins’ of the 
style world, Sarah Hogan, who was brought in by the Duchess of York to 
be her daughters’ fashion mentor.

Ms
 Hogan does not disclose her fees, but given that she is on the speed 
dials of some of the best-dressed women in London and New York, her 
services will not come cheap.

Meanwhile, Beatrice and Eugenie do not accept any discounts, paying full price for all their outfits.

It is an expensive commitment and proof, if it were needed, of their wish to take on a more prominent role.

Dave, who works for Virgin Galactic, complimented his tan with a pair of white board shorts, while the princess was careful to cover up her fair complexion by wearing a straw trilby hat.

After their dip, Beatrice clambered up the steps of the yacht behind her boyfriend, who had her towel ready and waiting

The princess opted to walk down the yacht's steps instead of diving and risking her dignity

Beatrice, who works in finance, was able to get out of the office and enjoy the summer sun during the couple's cruise

The 24-year-old princess followed her friends into the sea for a splash about in the crystal clear waters

Her boyfriend held her beach towel ready for her as she followed him up the yacht's steps.

The
 pair have been dating for six years and looked deep in conversation as 
they sat together on the deck on the boat after clambering back aboard.

They
 enjoyed a break from work and Beatrice's charity commitments ahead of 
her 25th birthday at the beginning of August in one of their favourite 
parts of the world.

Beatrice and Dave were spotted in the
 French Riviera last month with new celebrity friends, actors Ashton 
Kutcher and Mila Kunis.

Their
 unlikely friendship came about when Kutcher bought himself a space 
flight on Virgin Galactic, where Dave is the head of astronaut 
relations.

In May, the 
couple joined friends for a stay at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc on the Cap
 d'Antibes while soaking up the atmosphere of the Cannes Film Festival.
