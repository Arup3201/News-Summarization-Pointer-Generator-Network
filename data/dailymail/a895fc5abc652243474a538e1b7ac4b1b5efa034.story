She's Britain's favourite party girl so it made sense for Rimmel to call on Kate Moss to showcase its Christmas beauty range.

Kate, 40, looks party-ready in the new campaign imagery, which showcases the Royal Plush collection. 

The supermodel smoulders wearing rich and opulent eyeshadow and the bold, statement lips she knows how to work so well.

The entrepreneur has also used the campaign as an opportunity to plug the nail varnish she designed for the beauty brand. 

The model and muse shows off her new varnish, which comes with a gel-like finish and a touch of glitz.

This isn't the first tine she's created make-up for them. Her range of lipsticks have been some of the brand's best-selling products of all time. 

Perhaps Kim Kardashian, who recently cited Kate as her beauty icon, will look to these pictures for festive beauty inspiration.  

Despite their starkly contrasting looks, the global star has revealed that English rose Kate Moss is her beauty icon.

Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, the 34-year-old said: 'I love Kate Moss. I love how she wears her winged eyeliner and her messy hair and how it looks so effortless but still put together. It looks beachy and messy at the same time; I love her glamour.'

It's been a busy few weeks for the supermodel, who last fortnight joined Cara Delevingne at Printemps Haussmann in Paris. 

The two supermodels jetted into the French capital as the shopping venue revealed its Christmas decorations ahead of the merry season.

The pair have become so close that party-lover Kate even turned up to Jonathan Ross' Halloween bash dressed as Cara.

She looked uncannily like her younger protegee in a beanie hat, T-shirt, bomber jacket and skinny jeans.
