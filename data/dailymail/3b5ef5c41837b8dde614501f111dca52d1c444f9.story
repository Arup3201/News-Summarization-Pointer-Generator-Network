When travelling, sharing photos on social media is all part of the experience, even if it's just to boast about where you are or where you've been.

And it seems most digital-savvy holidaymakers are heading to New York, London and Las Vegas - which have been revealed as the top three Instagram destinations in the world.

After scouring 100,000 photos posted on the website with the hashtag 'vacation' during the summer, Hotelscombined.com has compiled an infographic and geo-plotted  an interactive map showcasing the top 30 places from where travellers share their photos. 

The site also analysed the results and geo-plotted each post on an interactive map.

Barcelona and Orlando make up the top five destinations - with Paris, Los Angeles, Moscow, Bangkok and Rome completing the top 10.

Overall, eight US destinations made it into the top 20, and five were in Europe.

The most Instagrammed spots within New York were Times Square, Central Park and the Empire State Building, while in London it was Big Ben, the Tower of London and Millennium Pier.  

More images were Instagrammed in the US than anywhere else in the world - probably due to the #vacation hashtag being searched.

The infographic also reveals the bottom 10 US states Instagrammed, with Kansas seeing the least at 1.62.
