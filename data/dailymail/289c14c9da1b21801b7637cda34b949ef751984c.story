Germany striker Lukas Podolski has insisted that Scotland will resort to brutal tactics as they seek a result from their opening European Championship qualifier on Sunday.

The Arsenal man appeared as substitute during the World Cup winners’ 4-2 friendly defeat to Argentina on Wednesday, in what was a rematch of the Rio showpiece back in July.

And afterwards, he insisted that the Scots will follow a physical approach for their game in Dortmund at the weekend.

‘I think they will play a dirty game,’ said Podolski. ‘Teams like Scotland or Ireland, especially at home they are strong, but our focus is on winning the game on Sunday and this is important for us.’

The 29-year-old also played down the defeat to Argentina, saying: ‘I think it was a good performance from us. We didn’t have a bad game, we just didn’t score.

‘In the end, it was 4-2 and we must focus on the next game. It’s important for us because it is a qualification game for the European Championship.’
