An anonymous donation made to a fund 85 
years ago is now worth £350m, but cannot be touched due to a condition made by the donor at the time

The £500,000 bequest - the same amount left by former nurse Joan Edwards which embarrassed the government this week - was to inspire the government to pay off the UK's debt.

But the donor specified in 1928 that the fund 
should be held in trust until the country raises enough money to pay off
the whole debt, which currently stands at £1.2 trillion.

Donation: A £500,000 legacy left to the nation in 1928 to pay off the national debt is worth £350 million today

The last Victorian: Miss Edwards pictured shortly before her death and, right, as a child in 1931, was well known amongst her neighbours leading a strict and pious lifestyle

The National Fund, set up in the same year of the donation and now managed by Barclays, has grown to become one of the largest charities in the UK by net assets.

Barclays has been trying for four years to get permission to use the money to make charitable grants or to turn it over to the Treasury, but any change would have to be approved by a court.

A spokesman said: 'We've been working ever since we became the trustee to change the original objects, which say the funds can be used only to pay off the entire national debt.

'We are working with the Charity Commission and the attorney general's office to look at how best to take the fund forward.'

Home sweet home: Joan Edwards pictured outside her Bristol council home in 1931 the former nurse left her fortune to the Government to spend 'as they may think fit.'

A spokesman for the attorney general's office said: 'There has been correspondence between the Charity Commission, the trustees and ourselves over the National Fund.

'We are looking at a number of options for the future of the Fund, consistent with its object of extinguishing or reducing the national debt.

'It would not be right to comment further whilst this process continues.'

A spokeswoman for the Charity Commission said is it continuing dialogue with the trustee and the attorney general's office regarding the charity.

This week, the Tories and Liberal Democrats handed the £520,000 left by Miss Edwards to the Treasury after a furious row emerged over their acceptance of the money.

Modest: The ordinary semi-detached property which Miss Edwards lived in all her life, under the right to buy the scheme she was offered the chance to buy it for just £2,000 but refused

David Cameron said the wording of her will made clear that her intention was for the money to 'benefit the nation' rather than political parties.

The legacy, disclosed along with other donations, sparked a bizarre row after a copy of the document emerged.

Conservative and Lib Dem officials previously briefed that they had split the money because it was earmarked for "whichever party was in government".

But the text obtained by the Daily Mail showed Miss Edwards - who died in September aged 90 - identified the beneficiary as "whichever government is in office at the date of my death".

As the backlash gathered pace, both coalition partners declared they would hand the funds to the Treasury as a gesture of good faith.
