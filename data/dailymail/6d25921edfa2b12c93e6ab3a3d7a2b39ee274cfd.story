She nuzzles his cheek, before coquettishly pawing his face. He watches admiringly as she stretches flirtatiously. 

And while there is no pea-green boat filled with honey and plenty of money, wrapped up in a five pound note, these two are clearly very fond of each other.

Just like in Edward Lear's 1871 poem, The Owl And The Pussycat, this unlikely duo have formed a close bond, as seen in a video uploaded to Facebook.

A new video shows this cute duo, Cleo and Forbi, who resemble the lovers from Edward Lear's famous poem

Flirtatious: While they don't go to sea in a pea-green boat, the pair certainly seem taken with each other

Cleo and Forbi belong to Brazilian biologist André Costa, who shared the cute footage of the two playing.

It has received more than 38,000 shares so far and gained Mr Costa quite a following.

In the famous poem, the owl and pussycat, who are in love, take to sea in a pea-green boat and sail for a year and a day.

Unlikely friendship:The pets belong to Brazilian biologist André Costa

Fiction to real life: In the famous nonsense poem, the owl and pussycat, who are in love, take to sea in a pea-green boat and sail for a year and a day. 

They arrive to the 'land where the Bong-Tree grows', where they borrow a ring from a pig and are married by a turkey. 

While the duo in the video don't have quite the same adventure, their flirtatious friendship will remind many of the beloved bedtime story. 

In a post on his Facebook page, Costa says that he hopes that the touching clip going viral has proven that there are still many people with a love and respect for animals.
