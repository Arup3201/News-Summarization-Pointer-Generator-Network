Police in Arizona are searching for a convicted criminal who they believe shot dead a young couple as they were lying in their bed.

Investigators are searching for Hector Karaca, 24, who is accused of gunning down 17-year-old Kristen Furgeri and her 25-year-old boyfriend, Jose Villa, inside their Phoenix home Monday night.

According to police, Karaca, who recently did time in prison for vehicle theft, fled in the couple’s car, which he later set alight a few streets away.

Crime scene: The couple were found slain inside a bungalow in the back of a home owned by Villa's parents near 27th Avenue and Indian School Road

Karaca was released from prison a month ago and may have been staying with the young couple. Police are still trying to determine the motive behind the murders, the station KPHO reported. 

According to witness accounts, the 24-year-old suspect was spotted in the company of Furgeri and Villa just hours before the double homicide. 

Police officers responded to the home of Villa’s parents near 27th Avenue and Indian School Road around 11.30pm Monday.

Upon entering the back of the residence, where the 25-year-old had been living with his girlfriend, officers found the couple's bodies lying in bed. No signs of struggle were seen at the crime scene.

Furgeri's mother, who lives in Montana, said that her daughter just got engaged to Villa after dating him for a year and was excited about graduating from high school.

The charred white 2005 Hyundai that was discovered abandoned in an alley near 20th Avenue north of Buckeye Road Tuesday morning was Villa's gift to his young bride, according to Sandra Furgeri.

‘It was her first car, she was excited to get her license, she was going to get it this week,’ the heartbroken mother told MyFox Phoenix.

Witnesses told police they saw Karaca jump into the car and drive away after the deadly shooting.

Karaca has an extensive criminal record dating back to 2006, when he was involved in a deadly armed convenience store burglary, AZFamily reported. Most recently, he served three years behind bars for stealing a car.

He is described as 6 feet tall, weighing about 175lbs with several distinctive tattoos, including the words 'South Side’ on his forearms, 'Tucson' across his upper back, 'Chavez' on his stomach and drama masks on his chest.

Police say Hector Karaca should be considered armed and dangerous.
