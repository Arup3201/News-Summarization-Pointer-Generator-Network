Glee actor Cory Monteith has died at the age 31, it has been confirmed.

The Canadian actor - who played Finn Hudson on the hit FOX series - was found on Saturday in his hotel room at the Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel in Vancouver.

Cory had checked into the hotel on July 6 and had been due to check out on Saturday.

In a short statement, Cory's publicist Melissa Kates said: 'We are in shock and mourning this tragic loss.'

Loved up: Corey and Lea at Los Angeles's LAX airport on June 20 - the last time they were pictured together

Just last month, the actor appeared to have put his troubles behind him after a brief spell in rehab as he attended the Chrysalis Butterfly Ball 
on June 8 in Los Angeles - their last public event together and his first post-rehab.

Cory was seen with his girlfriend Lea, 26, at LAX airport on June 20th, both smiling at cameras.

Lea appeared to be particularly proud 
of Cory, who successfully completed a rehab stint in April for what his 
rep described at the time to be a substance addiction.

It was Cory's second trip to a treatment facility - his first stint occurred when he was 19.

'An exceptional person': Glee producers and Fox Television expressed their sorrow in a short statement

'I
love and support Cory and will stand by him through this,' Michele told
People at the time. 'I am grateful and proud he made this decision.'

When he left treatment, he tweeted: 'Sending out big love to everyone. thank you for the continued support! It means the world to me! :).'

The pair were pictured in late April after the actor had left rehab, going on holiday to Mexico together.

Lea also accompanied Cory on a trip to home to Vancouver to visit his mother Ann.

In 2011, the actor sensationally 
admitted that he was 'lucky to be alive' after he went to rehab as a 
teenager for alcohol addiction.

Cory
admitted he skipped school to get drunk and smoke pot when he was just 
13-years-old and quit his education at the age of 16.

By the time he was 19, the TV singing sensation was undergoing a stint in rehab to battle his demons.

Speaking about his former drug habit, the actor said he did 'anything and everything - as much as possible. I had a serious problem. I was out of control. I am lucky to be alive.'

In
a 2011 interview, he said: 'I don't want kids to think it's okay to 
drop out of school and get high, and they'll be famous actors, too. But 
for those people who might give up: Get real about what you want and go 
after it.'

Close: Lea posted a photo of herself with Cory and her best friend Jonathan Groff on Instagram on June 18, writing 'my two favourite boys'

Gone too soon: Cory was known for his role as Finn Hudson on the hugely popular series Glee

Cory was born in Calgary to Joe Monteith and Ann McGregor in 1982, joining big brother Shaun.

After his parents divorced when he was seven, he and his brother moved with their mother to Victoria, British Columbia.

Although a promising student, Cory grew up to be a troubled teenager, experimenting with drugs and alcohol.

Following
his original rehab stint at 19, Cory worked several jobs, including a 
Wal-Mart people greeter, taxi driver, school bus driver and roofer.

After
turning to acting, he made his first TV appearance in Stargate Atlantis
in 2004, going on to make his film debut in horror film Killer Mary two
years later.

Before finding fame on Glee as Finn in 2009, he also had small roles in Final Destination 3 and Deck The Halls.

He was cast in Glee after his agent sent creator Ryan Murphy a video of Cory drumming with pencils and plastic containers.

After a second video was submitted featuring Cory singing 'a cheesy, '80s music-video-style version' of REO Speedwagon's Can't Fight This Feeling, he was invited to a mass audition in Los Angeles, where won over producers and was given the role of Finn.

In the original series, Finn was the star quarterback of the William McKinley High School football team, who was blackmailed into joining the glee club New Directions by Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison).

Fans of the show have been captivated by Finn and Rachel Berry (Lea's character) on/off romance.
