Thorgan Hazard, younger brother of Chelsea star Eden, looks set to stay at Borussia Monchengladbach beyond the end of this season.

Hazard moved to the Bundesliga from Stamford Bridge on a season-long loan deal last summer and Gladbach have confirmed the winger is in talks to stay in Germany.

The German side would prefer a permanent deal and Chelsea, who would be happier to loan Hazard again, could be persuaded if a buy-back clause is inserted.

General manager Max Eberl told Kicker: 'We are still in good talks with Chelsea. The fact is that Thorgan is happy to stay here.

'The fact is also that Chelsea have signalled that they can see it happening. And it's a fact that we are very keen to take Thorgan.'

Hazard, 21, joined Chelsea from Lens in July 2012 and spent two years on loan in his Belgian homeland with Zulte-Waregem before his move to Germany.
