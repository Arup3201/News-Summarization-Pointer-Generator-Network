He has been embroiled in a well-documented feud with Italian designers Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana after the former called babies born through in-vitro fertilization (IVF)  'synthetic'.

But Sir Elton John - whose two sons Zachary, four, and Elijah, two, were conceived with the help of a surrogate and artificial insemination - appeared to offer an olive branch when he declared his love for the fashion duo in Las Vegas on Wednesday night. 

Speaking on stage at his concert at the Colosseum, Elton included the pair in a list of inspirational people who have changed the world, such as Nelson Mandela and Lady Diana, according to TMZ.

While his praise for the designers was greeted with laughter by the audience, Elton went on to add: 'Listen, the band have been wearing Dolce & Gabbana, I love Dolce & Gabbana clothes.'

Sir Elton announced last week that he would boycott the brand after designer Domenico Dolce criticised IVF, saying: 'You are born and you have a father and mother. At least it should be like that. That's why I'm not convinced by what I call chemical children, synthetic babies.'

Elton, who is married to David Furnish, responded furiously, writing on Sunday: 'How dare you refer to my beautiful children as "synthetic".

'And shame on you for wagging your judgmental little fingers at IVF – a miracle that has allowed legions of loving people, both straight and gay, to fulfil their dream of having children.

'Your archaic thinking is out of step with the times, just like your fashions. I shall never wear Dolce and Gabbana ever again. #BoycottDolceGabbana.'

His outburst prompted a mass social media campaign, as 66,000 people joined his call to stop buying clothes from the luxury brand.

Equality campaigners and celebrities also weighed in on the dispute - gay rights activist Peter Tatchell has organised a protest outside D&G's London store on Thurday to show the public's opposition to the inflammatory comments.

Victoria Beckham, a former Dolce and Gabbana ambassador who is close friends with Sir Elton, offered her support with the message: 'Sending love to Elton David Zachary Elijah & all the beautiful IVF babies x vb.'

But the designers hit back - Stefano Gabbana told an Italian newspaper: 'It's useless, this is just an authoritarian way of seeing things: if you agree with me, good, otherwise I'll attack. And I wrote to him, in the comments on Instagram: fascist.'

Things took a twist when Elton was seen carrying a D&G-branded bag only 24 hours after he entered into a high-profile row with the designers over their criticism of fertility treatments.

Photographers said Sir Elton was seen carrying the Dolce & Gabbana bag on March 16, after being dropped off in his chauffeur-driven SUV.

A spokesman for the singer confirmed: ‘Yes he was carrying the bag but he hadn’t been shopping. And it should not detract from their original message or the boycott.’

Elton's comments on-stage in Las Vegas came after Dolce insisted his views were private, personal beliefs that were based on his sense of a traditional Sicilian family. 

In an interview with CNN, Dolce insisted he did not judge people who chose the procedure, and said: 'I believe in the traditional family.

'It is impossible to change my culture for something different. It's me...I respect all the world, all the culture.'

Dolce said he would not be not boycotting the artist and added: 'I love the music of Elton John.'

He said he believed they could end the dispute and added: 'Every people resolve everything by talk...we start to talk, the problem is resolved.

'Every people [has] freedom for choosing what they want. This for me is democracy. I respect you because you choose what you want.

'I respect me because I choose what I want. This just my point of private view.'
