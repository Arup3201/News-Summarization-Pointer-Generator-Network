The new Mike Tyson does not look like the old Mike Tyson.

Gennady Golovkin has a baby face unadorned by menacing warrior tattoos but he is a prize-ring assassin just the same.

As the real world middleweight champion he is, naturally, smaller than the youngest man ever to win the world heavyweight title.

He is also respectful of his opponents, unfailingly polite to all he meets, rarely if ever swears in any of the four languages he speaks fluently, often dresses like an English country gentleman, regularly takes his son on the school run in his adopted Germany and has a smile like sunshine.

But this is where the dissimilarities end: Outside the ring.

The Kazakh known as GGG – his middle name is a longer version of his first name – is the most powerful pound-for-pound puncher in the world.

Deontay Wilder may be the biggest-hitting heavyweight but in terms of comparative size, Golovkin is the most devastating.

It appears that not even the most thunderous of the light-heavyweights can live with him.

Sergey Kovalev, the Russian Krusher who flattened Nathan Cleverly and recently ended the long championship reign of Bernard Hopkins, is reported to have withdrawn from sparring with Golovkin because he was getting badly hurt.

Kovalev’s trainer is in denial about that but the anecdotal evidence is plentiful.

Golovkin has knocked out 28 of his 31 victims in an all-win professional career thus far and St Helens’ own Martin Murray is next to climb the scaffold, in Monte Carlo on Saturday night.

He has not been taken the distance since an eight-rounder all of six years and 18 fights ago.

Nor, since he seems to have a chin as granite as his fists, has he ever been knocked off his own feet. Not for a second.

That charming demeanour evaporates when the first bell rings. Golovkin becomes a destructive monster and if you keep your hands up to protect your head he simply sets about disembowelling you.

Matthew Macklin, the much-respected and usually durable Anglo-Irish middleweight contender, was crumpled by a single body shot and reports: ‘I’ve never been hit that hard in my life. It’s scary.’

This man certainly appears to put the wind up even the most accomplished boxers around his weight.

Golovkin has been trying, so far in vain, to secure big-name fights against the likes of Sergio Martinez, Miguel Cotto and Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr.

He says: ‘I want these major fights but what can I do if they won’t get in the ring with me.’

It is to Murray’s enormous credit that he has agreed to venture where others fear to tread despite the lure of Golovkin’s WBA and IBO world titles being at stake.

All the more so since this one-man wrecking ball is in his prime at 32.

Murray freely admits that Felix Sturm and Martinez were somewhat in decline when they inflicted the only minor blemishes on his record, a controversial draw and a disputed defeat in those respective world title challenges.

Not Golovkin, who patiently built the foundation of his career through 350 amateur fights of which he won all but five.

The professional steel which is his backbone now was embedded in boyhood.

Two of Golovkin’s four brothers were killed in mysterious action when serving with the Soviet army in the 1990s. But they knew GGG was the most ferocious of them and when they were growing up together in Kazakhstan they used to challenge grown men to fight the seven-year-old Gennady in the streets, where he gave them a beating.

The Russian government declined to disclose details of their deaths or permit funerals.

‘It was a very hard time for us,’ says Golovkin. ‘Our family was torn apart.’

Now he honours the memory of his late siblings in the ring.

Monte Carlo’s sumptuous Salle des Etoiles is a world far removed from the grimy town of Karaganda, where his coal-miner father and Korean mother struggled to bring them all up.

But the chandeliers of this casino ballroom will glitter down on either Gennady Golovkin hammering out his latest concussive triumph…or Martin Murray springing one of boxing’s bigger surprises.

Golovkin-Murray will be live on Channel 5 from 10 pm this Saturday night.
