Bog standard manicures that chip in minutes are no longer enough for Britain's nail-obsessed women. We we want mirror-like gloss, with the depth and finish of a sports car's paint job.

The solution? Gel manicures - which have fast become the best way to get a high gloss, long-lasting manicure.

Thanks to the specialist kit involved though, it has taken a professional manicurist to get such results - and it's costly too, with one gel manicure costing upwards of £25, and often a second payment needed to remove it.

Dancing on Ice's chief make up artist Rene Metcalf used Sensationail on the contestants - including Emmerdale's Matthew Wolfenden

Now though, for the first time, a 
home gel manicure kit has gone on sale in the UK - reducing the cost per
manicure to just £5.77.

Nailene's
Sensationail kit features a high-tech breed of polish that takes 
seconds to paint on and a couple of minutes to dry, or cure, as the 
beauticians call it - but it lasts weeks.

Nailene's home gel manicure kit comes with an LED lamp to 'cure' the polishes, meaning they last up to two weeks without chipping

The Nailene Sensationail Invincible Gel Polish Starter kit costs £85 - a seemingly high outlay for a manicure pack - but in the kit is everything you need to create a salon-finish manicure, including a primer, a special base and top coat, a colour, and files and wipes - as well as the LED UV lamp vital to set the polish.

The kits, which sold out across 7,000 U.S. outlets in 24 hours, have now seen equally good sales in the UK

When it went on sale in the U.S., the Nailene manicure kit became the number one home gel kit in the country in its first 24 hours, selling out in over 7,000 stores including WalMart and CVS.

Ahead of their sale in this country, the kits had a waiting list of over 10,000 with Nailene - and since hitting the shelves at Boots, they have caused a storm.

Hailed 'the ultimate home gel manicure' by U.S. journalists and The Today Show, the kit claims to give identical results to a salon gel manicure, but at a fraction of the cost.

The firm claims that the kit will pay for itself in under seven weeks, based on buyers carrying out one manicure every two weeks, with one home manicure working out at £5.77, compared to an average of £25 for a salon treatment.

The kits, which launched into Boots stores earlier this month, went on to cause minor hysteria on the high street just days later, when it was revealed via Twitter that the Dancing on Ice chief make-up artist Rene Metcalfe had been using the kits on the skating show's contestants - including on Emmerdale's Matthew Wolfenden.

'It gives the most perfect and long-lasting finish during all the training and dancing on the show,' she said. 'And it makes it very easy to change the colour to match the costumes.'

Following the revelations, sales soared over 523 per cent, and shoppers were reduced to snatching at the last boxes on the quickly depleted shelves.

In fact, Boots have reported that 33 per cent of the sales in store have been to men - raising the question of whether they are buying it for themselves, or for their ladies.

The starter kits are currently the only product available, but in May, individual colours will be available to buy in Boots stores at £15 per bottle.
