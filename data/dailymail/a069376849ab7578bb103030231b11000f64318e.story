An American sentenced to 
two-and-a-half years in a Thai prison for translating a banned biography
about the country's king and posting the content online has been freed 
by a royal pardon.

Joe Gordon was convicted in December for translating excerpts of the book The King Never Smiles from English into Thai.

The punishment was a high-profile 
example of the severe sentences meted out for defaming Thailand's royal 
family, an issue that has raised concern about freedom of expression in 
the south-east Asian kingdom.

Rough justice: Joe Gordon is led into the Bangkok Criminal Court for sentencing last December. He was freed by royal pardon today

No reason was given for the pardon, 
but U.S. officials have pressed Thai authorities to release the 
Thai-born American since he was first detained in May 2011.

Mr Gordon was freed from Bangkok's Remand prison late yesterday.

U.S. Embassy spokesman Walter 
Braunohler said: 'We are pleased that His Majesty King Bhumibol 
Adulyadej granted Joe Gordon a royal pardon, which allowed him to be 
released from prison.

'We urge Thai authorities on a 
regular basis, both privately and publically, in Bangkok and in 
Washington, to ensure that freedom of expression is protected in 
accordance with its international obligations.'

Mr Braunohler declined to comment on Mr Gordon's whereabouts or what his future plans were.

Mr Gordon's lawyer, Arnon Numpa, said he would likely return to the U.S. within several days.

Bhumibol, the world's longest-reigning monarch, is revered in Thailand and is widely seen as a stabilising force.

But Thailand's lese-majeste laws are 
the harshest in the world. They mandate that people found guilty of 
defaming the monarchy - including the king, the queen and the heir to 
the throne - face three to 15 years behind bars.

The nation's 2007 Computer Crimes Act
also contains provisions that have enabled prosecutors to increase 
lese-majeste sentences.

Opponents of the laws say that while 
the royal family should be protected from defamation, lese-majeste laws 
are often abused to punish political rivals.

That has been especially true amid the political turmoil that has followed a 2006 military coup.

Many had hoped the administration of 
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, which assumed power after elections a
year ago and has prominent supporters who have been accused of 
lese-majeste, would reform the laws.

The issue remains highly sensitive, 
however, and Yingluck's government has bee as aggressive in pursuing the
cases as its predecessors.

Mr Gordon, posted links to the banned
biography of the king several years ago while residing in the U.S. 
state of Colorado, and his case has raised questions about the 
applicability of Thai law to acts committed by foreigners outside 
Thailand.

Behind bars: Mr Gordon was arrested and detained while on a visit to Thailand in May last year

In the banned book, author Paul M Handley retraces the king's life, alleging that he has been a major stumbling block to the progress of democracy in Thailand as he consolidated royal power over his long reign.

Mr Gordon, who lived in the U.S. for about 30 years, was visiting his native country to seek treatment for arthritis and high blood pressure at the time of his arrest.

After being repeatedly denied bail, he pleaded guilty in October last year in hopes of obtaining a lenient sentence.

The judge said at the time that the punishment, initially set at five years, was reduced because of his plea.
