Ever wondered why David Gandy earns the big bucks? His debut fashion shoot of 2014 should answer that.

The Essex-born model, 33, sports his trademark goatee beard and quiffed hair as he poses for Man Of The World magazine - quite a fitting title for Britain's highest-paid, globe-trotting male model.

Modelling chunky knits, Wellington boots and tartan,Â David is the ultimate gentleman farmer in the campaign, which was photographed by John Balsom.

Tug of war, anyone? David Gandy stars in his first magazine cover shoot of 2014

In one shot, David hold a tattered rope over his shoulder and in another he pensively writes notes in his book - next week's juice fast, perhaps?

David has been out and about quite a bit recently, partying at the Mens Health, Liberty and YMC men's fashion week parties.

Last
month, the fashion world's most eligible bachelor was spotted holding 
hands with a mystery woman as they partied in private members' club The 
Groucho.

His last relationship ended in October when we reported David had split from alleged girlfriend of five months, Samantha Barks.

The
heartthrob was last seen with the 23-year-old during London Fashion 
Week in September before the couple called time on the relationship.

David has also dated model Sarah Ann Macklin and The Saturdays' Mollie King.Dapper: Tinie Tempah and David Gandy at the Topman Design show
