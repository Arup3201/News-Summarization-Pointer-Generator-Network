One of the most legendary horror homes to feature in the movies: the house with the scariest basement in America, from Nightmare On Elm Street, appears to now be in a dreamlike state.

The house that Freddy Krueger haunted is actually on North Genesee Avenue in Los Angeles.

It was a delightful suburban cottage when it appeared in the film, but it fell into neglect by the previous family who owned it who left the house to fall apart.

It recent years it has undergone an extensive renovation turning it into something more akin to a dream home than haunted house.

Dream house: After a massive renovation this famous Los Angeles home sold for $2.1 million in 2013

Scary: The house looked far less appealing when it made an appearance in 'A Nightmare on Elm Street'

Lounging: Besides a totally redone interior and exterior, the backyard features a plush garden and stunning pool

Unworried about its history of cinematic terror, Angie Hill purchased the house in 2008 for $1.15 million and spent a year renovating the property. 

Initially, the home bore a greater resemblance to the decrepit and decaying version in Freddy's dream world than the original sunny suburban home that shows up in the early films. 

'It was horrible,' Hill said. 'It was the only house on the street that looked beaten up.... The pool looked like it hadn't been touched in 10 years - it was black.'

Paint was chipping and cracks were showing all over the home's exterior, and the concrete patio in the backyard was breaking apart. 

Asking price: The house sold for the full asking price of $2.1 million only seven years after the deteriorating house sold for $1.15 million

All new: For the renovation, designers fused modern and traditional elements replacing every piece of wood and redoing the floor plan

Pleasant dreams: The new owners will have their choice of three huge bedrooms each with its own private bath

Modern: The newly redone house is filled with state-of-the-art furnishing and appliances

'It had the weirdest vibe,' Hill said. 'You could feel the weird energy. There was a really oppressive odor.'

So she burned some sage to get ready of the bad energy, and then completely dismantled the property.  

First, she burned sage to clear the energy in the house, she said. Then, she took apart 90 percent of the entire home - walls, ceilings, the roof - and replaced them.

Inside, it's now a striking piece of traditional/modernist fusion that neither Freddy Krueger nor Nancy Thompson would recognize, as shown in a 2012 listing for the property. 

It sold in 2013 for $2.1 million - a few hundred thousand dollars more than it cost director Wes Craven to make the original 'Nightmare' movie.

'I replaced every piece of wood and reconfigured the floor plan,' recalled Hill. 'I ripped off half the house.'

Only a portion of the exterior shell of the house remained intact while she gut-renovated every room.

The work was so extensive that it took nearly a year to complete before she could officially move in.

The front exterior of the house still looks mostly the same as it did in 'Elm Street,' with a striking red door. 

Cult followers of the classic horror film still recognize it today.

'People stop and take pictures, and there's a tour bus that goes by three times a day,' Hill said. 

'Sometimes people come to the door and say stupid things like, 'Do you know what house this is?' '

She admits, the home's fictional history of horror still has a very real effect on her.

Although there was no nightmare villain hanging out in the property, it still gave Hill the creeps.

'I used to be afraid to go in the basement,' she said.

Get cooking: This stocked kitchen is any chef's dream

Hardwood: The home's gorgeous hardwood floors run all over the new floorplan

Chef's kitchen: There'll be no need to have nightmares about dinner with this fully-renovated kitchen filled with stainless steel appliances

Long visit: Invite friends to stay in comfort at the property's beautiful one bedroom guest house

The renovation features completely modern furnishings, stainless steel kitchen appliances, and hardwood floors throughout.

The backyard is just as plush as the indoors, with a gorgeous garden and pool.  

Basement chills: Horror fans can take comfort in the fact that from the outside, the home looks almost exactly the same as it did in the films. But the inside is a totally different story
