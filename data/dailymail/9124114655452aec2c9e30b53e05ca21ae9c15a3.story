Only a handful of participants actually make it, out of around fifty people a week who take on the challenge

It may sound like a breeze at just six chicken wings in 10 minutes - but Britain's hottest 'hot-wing challenge' is so tough participants must sign a waiver before taking part.

Each wing is laced with the infamous Naga Viper chilli - a pepper 250 times hotter than a jalapeno.

Around 50 diners take on the challenge, and, like Tomasz Piatkowsk pictured here, must sign a waiver-form before they brave the feat.

It registers a huge 1.3m on the Scoville scale for chilli heat and is so corrosive it has to be handled with gloves.

The challenge is a mainstay on the menu at the Red Dog Saloon in Hoxton, London.

Owner Tom Berk said the recipe - which also contains garlic, lime, orange and butter - was inspired by 'taste, adrenaline and euphoria'.

'There are very specific rules for the Hot Wings Challenge, which are the same for everybody and which we are very tough on,' he said.

'There are six hot wings and 10 minutes to eat them.

'By eating them you have to pick them up and eat them off the bone - you are not allowed to remove the meat from the bone first.

'You are not allowed to leave the table, you are not allowed anything to drink.

'Once you have eaten the wings we stop the clock and start a fresh clock and there is a five minute burn-time where the same rules apply.

'You do all that and you become a champion.' 

Out of all the people who take on the hot wings challenge each week, only about two or three succeed.

The restaurant's other challenge is 'The Devastator Challenge'.

This pits hungry diners against an 8in burger, large fries and milkshake in 10 minutes.
