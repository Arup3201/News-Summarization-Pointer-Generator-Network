More than half of the contiguous United States was coated in snow today as a deadly arctic blast swept across the country - the most on record for this early in the year.

The deadly storm, dubbed 'Bozeman' by meteorologists, has so far struck most of the Lower 48 states, with snow blasts as far south as West Texas, NOAA's National Snow Analysis reported.

While the Texas Panhandle is covered by up to four inches of snow, the entire states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and Oklahoma are also swamped in the white stuff. 

The snow levels are the highest America has seen in early November since records began in 2003 - with  this year's 50.4 per cent coverage of the Lower 48 neared only by 31 per cent in 2012.

Record-breaking levels: More than 50 per cent of the contiguous United States was blasted by snow this morning as a deadly arctic blast swept across the country - the most on record for this early in the year

Contrast: The snow levels are the highest America has seen in early November since records began in 2003. Above, in 2003, only a few Western and Northeast states in the Lower 48 were covered in the white stuff

Snowy: The deadly storm, dubbed 'Bozeman' by meteorologists, has so far struck most of the Lower 48 states, with snow blasts as far south as West Texas. Above, a man exists a train in New York this afternoon

Cold weather: While the Texas Panhandle is covered by up to four inches of snow, the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky (pictured) and Oklahoma are also swamped in the white stuff

Accident: Caelan Slate, of Nortonville, Kentucky, is pictured calling his work to say he is going to be late after losing control and landing his truck in a ditch of off the Pennyrile Parkway in Henderson County this morning

A breezy walk: The snow levels are expected to increase this evening as the storm sweeps across the Northeast and South. Above, Linda Barnett and her husband, Mike, walk in the snow in Cincinatti, Ohio, today

And they are expected to  increase this evening as the storm sweeps across the Northeast and South  - with January-like temperatures causing up to 36 inches of snow around the Great Lakes. 

Almost all of the 50.4 per cent was accumulated in the past seven days, according to NOAA figures seen by The Washington Post. A week ago, snow covered only 11 per cent of the contiguous US.

Northern Wisconsin has been the region most affected by snow so far - with some locations seeing a staggering 50 inches of snow from November 10 to 14.

This morning, Storm Bozeman tore through parts of the Midwest, leaving commuters facing a 'treacherous' commute and forcing many schools to close, before heading to the East and South.

Kevin Roth, lead meteorologist at The Weather Channel, said the heaviest bout would come from Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, New York, warning:  'It's going to be painful.' 

He added: 'You're talking 24 to 36 inches coming down at a rate of up to five or six inches an hour—that's what we mean when we say intense.'

Boston, New York and Washington D.C saw temperatures in the low 30s today - up to 30 degrees below average for this time of year - while other areas reached only the mid 20s.

In the Northwest, temperatures at Boise Airport in Idaho broke a 134-year-old record at six degrees this morning, one degree colder than the seven degrees recorded on November 17, 1880. 

Icy conditions: An arctic blast that killed at least 11 people over the weekend issued a second strike today. Above, a car drives down a snowy road at Castlewood State Park outside St Louis, Missouri on Sunday

Accident: Over the weekend, at least 11 people were killed as unseasonable ice and snow froze roads, leading to hundreds of accidents. Above, firemen inspect a minivan that swerved off the road in Kansas on Sunday

Warning: This map shows the parts of the US - particularly, the East - that were today given weather warnings

By tomorrow, parts of the South, including sections of Tennessee and North Carolina, could even see highs of below freezing, according to NBC. Wind gusts in these areas could reach 50mph.

'By then, the whole eastern half of the United States will have temperatures from 15 to 30 degrees below average,' said Tom Moore, meteorologist at The Weather Channel said.  

The top levels of snowfall recorded in parts of the U.S. over the weekend were:

Montana: 21.4 inches at Black Bear SNOTEL

Wyoming: 32.3 inches at Grassy Lake SNOTEL

Idaho: 28.5 inches at Vienna Mine SNOTEL

Colorado: 21 inches at Coal Bank Pass

Oregon: 19 inches (with 0.5 inch ice accumulation) in Prineville

Utah: 15.8 inches at Garden City Summit SNOTEL

Washington: 15 inches near White Salmon

Over the weekend, at least 11 people were killed as unseasonable ice and snow froze the roads, leading to hundreds of accidents, some of which were fatal.

On Saturday, five people were killed in weather-related smashes in Minnesota, while another person died in a three-car crash on Interstate 94 near Rogers the following morning. 

Also on Sunday, four people  died in accidents in Lubbock, Texas, and a 25-year-old man was killed when he veered off the road in icy conditions in Dinsmore Township, Ohio.

Despite transport crews in many areas treating roads with salt and sand - and those in the most affected cities plowing snow - the conditions remain hazardous.

On its website, The Weather Channel warned: 'It doesn't take much snow to make roads slick, especially in areas less accustomed to frequent snow where more roads may be untreated.'

In Idaho, dozens of school in the southwest were reportedly canceled classes on Friday due to the deadly weather, with more than a foot of snow having fallen in the mountains. 

Meanwhile, this morning, a layer of ice was visible on parts of Lake Superior in Ashland, Wisconsin, several weeks earlier than normal, according to ABC.

Storm Bozeman first started moving into the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday night, bringing mild, moist Pacific air to land, resulting in unusual winterlike weather.

It has now become a record November snowstorm in Boise, Idaho, with 7.6 inches of snow reported in the region, according to the National Weather Service. It will move to Canada later this week. 

The epicenter of the phenomenon is the remnants of Typhoon Nuri, which is causing areas of exceptionally low pressure over the Bering Sea, between Russia and Alaska.

This has bent the jet stream, a barrier of wind which usually keeps hot and cold air separate, pulling warm air north and pushing cold air south.

The weather forecast for today - Monday, November 17 - shows storms, rain and snow across the East Coast

Getting brighter? Meanwhile, tomorrow's forecast shows less stormy, snowy weather across the same area

Winter alerts: Despite the weather warnings, snow is expected to fall less and less as Storm Bozeman gradually loses moisture support from the Pacific Ocean. Above, winter weather alerts in the US today

The pattern of pressures forms a bulge that resembles the Greek letter omega (Ω), and is therefore referred to as an Omega Block. 

Cold air which would usually sits near Canada has been pulled down as far as Texas, while warmer air from around the United States sails north. 

Later this week, one more push of cold air is expected, which could send temperatures plummeting to 40 degrees below average for this time of year, particularly across the Great Lakes.

But next week, it is forecast to shoot back up into 'normal' territory, making it feel more like November than January.
