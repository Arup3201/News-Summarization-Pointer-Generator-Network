Gary Cahill ought to be well prepared to take on the mantle of being one of England’s dominant and iconic defenders. After all, he plays alongside one in John Terry.

The Chelsea captain is not in Brazil despite his resurgence of form in the Premier League, his decision to quit the team in the wake of his FA racism charge having probably cost him an international swansong.

Nevertheless, it is to the credit of his Chelsea partner, Cahill, and the form of Phil Jagielka that it has not been a pressing issue in the build-up to Saturday’s game against Italy here.

Many see central defence as an area of potential weakness in this England team, but over the past two-and-a-half years Cahill has quietly been growing into Chelsea’s most dependable defender, helped of course by the man alongside him.

‘I’ve learned a lot from John,’ says Cahill. ‘I took things from his leadership and his reading of the game, positionally.

‘John was a leader and I think I’m accepted at this level now, which is pleasing. That’s not to say there is any sort of complacency in my game. There are still people coming up behind you, and I still want to go and achieve as much as I can in my career. I just feel I have been accepted at this level.’

Cahill’s improvement curve has been steady. His performances against Barcelona in the Champions League semi-final of 2012 and Bayern Munich in the final and then against Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid last season have seen him deal with the likes of Lionel Messi, Mario Gomez, Edinson Cavani and Diego Costa.

Derbyshire-born, he grew up watching Des Walker at Hillsborough and cites Tony Adams, Sol Campbell and Martin Keown as the dominant England centre halves he recalls. ‘They are goals you have to set,’ he said. ‘You get your opportunity, you try to take it and then you try to build on it.

‘There have been some top-quality centre backs for England, haven’t there? At this moment, in the 23 there are four lads for that position and we are all looking to do as well as we can.’

At the age of 28, this is Cahill’s first international tournament. He missed out on Euro 2012, breaking his jaw in the last friendly before the event. In 2010 he was only an outsider for the squad and a potentially fatal blood clot kept him out of action in the run-up.

Now, it is Mario Balotelli he must keep quiet. He has faced him only twice, once for Bolton and once for Chelsea but the omens are good: Balotelli didn’t score in either of those games and was hauled off at half-time against Chelsea.

Cahill also has to contend with the Amazonian humidity and heat, a novel experience for all the players. Yesterday England travelled to Manaus and were confined to a gym session but today they will do light training in the Arena Amazonia.

‘We’ve done all we possibly can,’ he said. ‘It’s hard for English players. We’re not used to this climate full-stop. But we’ve been training and now playing in hot conditions. Miami was roasting for the Honduras game. We’ve done the heat chambers, we’ve done the extra layers of clothing, so we’ve done all we possibly can going into the game so we feel like we’ve prepared the best we can.’

Cahill says the training camp in Portugal was the most uncomfortable: ‘The first  couple of times we trained with all the layers on it was tough. Now we feel a lot better, so it’s obviously worked.’

The true test will be tomorrow when Cahill takes another step on his career progression —  perhaps  to establish himself as an iconic England defender.
