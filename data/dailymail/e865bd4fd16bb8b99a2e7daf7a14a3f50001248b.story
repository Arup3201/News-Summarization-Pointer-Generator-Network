Labour MP Margaret Hodge has warned the Charity Commission is 'not fit for purpose' and 'risks undermining public trust' in charities

Money given to charity could be diverted to terrorists because a watchdog is not investigating abuses properly, a damning report has warned.

The Charity Commission monitors voluntary organisations over three areas of high risk: fraud, whether they safeguard beneficiaries, and counter-terrorism.

But it now has only two members of staff doing this work and just 42 probes were started last year, compared to 306 a year before the last election, increasing a ‘risk that serious concerns will go undetected’.

In a critical report, the National Audit Office spending watchdog said failings could damage public faith in good causes. The commission needs a ‘radical change of pace and rigour’, it said.

Bosses were warned to expect ‘tough questions’ when they appear before the Commons public accounts committee this month. Its chairman, Labour MP Margaret Hodge, said the report suggested the body was not ‘fit for purpose’ and ‘risks undermining public trust’ in charities.

It is an indictment of the chairmanship of so-called ‘quango queen’ Dame Suzi Leather, who left in July last year. Over her six-year reign Dame Suzi, who held a number of other public posts at the same time, attracted controversy for her criticism of independent schools. She was paid £80,000 for a three-day week.

The NAO report was prompted by MPs’ concerns at a complex tax avoidance scheme engaged in by charity The Cup Trust.

It gave just £152,292 to good causes despite trying to claim back a stunning £46million in Gift Aid from tax authorities on its £177million income.

The commission launched a full investigation in April, admitting the case was ‘a disaster for the charity sector’.

It insists its records suggest the case was unique – but it did identify 13 other charities which required investigation.

But the NAO said the body should have acted far sooner.

Its report found the commission was ‘not regulating charities effectively’ and was failing to provide value for money to the taxpayer for its £22.7million-a-year budget. It said: ‘It does important and necessary work and its independent status is highly valued, but it does not do enough to identify and tackle abuse of charitable status.’

It noted that the NAO had ‘repeatedly identified concerns’ in reports stretching back more than 25 years, and said that the commission was slow to act.

‘It uses its information poorly to assess risk and often relies solely on trustees’ assurances.

‘Where it does identify concerns in charities, it makes little use of its powers and fails to take tough action in some of the most serious cases.

‘The commission is too passive in pursuing its objectives, letting practical and legal barriers prevent action, rather than considering alternative ways to prevent abuse of charitable status.’ 

The NAO criticised the Charity 
Commission for reducing staff monitoring things like counter-terrorism 
from around eight full-time equivalents to two.

The report said: ‘It opened 42 monitoring cases in 2012/13 and 72 in 2011/12, 276 in 2010/11 and 306 in 2009/10. This reduction in monitoring cases increases the risk that serious concerns will  go undetected.’

In the three years to March, not one charity trustee was removed by the commission, only two were suspended and there were only 17 instances where it intervened to prevent charities entering transactions.

One pound in every ten of its budget was spent on accommodation and staff complaints about an unreliable IT system. Efforts to cope with a recent 40 per cent budget cut failed to ‘put sufficient emphasis on the rigour of its registration process and its investigation of wrongdoing’, the NAO said.

The report concluded: ‘We welcome the commission’s intention to change its strategy, and encourage the new board to bring about the radical change of pace and rigour which is so evidently needed.’

Sam Younger, the commission’s chief executive, will appear before the public accounts committee on December 16, nine months after he was grilled on the Cup Trust case.

Mrs Hodge suggested then that there could be as many as 50 other tax avoidance cases – but the NAO report said the commission’s internal investigations had discounted that claim.

Sir Stuart Etherington, of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said: ‘This report reflects what we have said for years. In order to maintain public trust, charities want a vigilant and effective regulator which takes prompt action in the rare instances of abuse.'
