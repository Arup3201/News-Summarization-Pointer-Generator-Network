Seized: Police swooped on Bulgarian murder suspect Tihomir Georgiev in South London

A notorious Bulgarian gangster who was one of the world's most wanted criminals has been seized by police - after being tracked down to a gym in South London.

Shaven-headed Tihomir Georgiev, who was on Interpol's 'most wanted' list, was suspected of murder when he fled his native country for London.

The 43-year-old, a boxer and former henchman to a Bulgarian mafia boss, reportedly has a fearsome reputation for slicing off the ears and fingers of his enemies.

But after fleeing the Britain, 
Georgiev was seized by officers from Scotland Yard's Extradition Unit 
yesterday at a boxing gym in Bermondsey, South London, according to The 
Sun.

The Bulgarian was 
still wearing shorts and fighters' bandages on his hands when police led
 him away under a European Arrest Warrant, according to the paper

Georgiev,
 suspected of murdering one of his own drug dealers for disobeying an 
order, was part of a gang of criminals seized in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 
2010.

But before the trial concluded, he skipped his Â£20,000 bail, fled to London, and lived on the streets for months until the owner of Rooney's Gym in Bermondsey took pity on him, allowing him to sleep and train at the facility.

Georgiev even took part in boxing events at the gym and his face was used on promotional posters for upcoming events.

The Bulgarian fugitive was able to flee to the UK as his home country joined the EU in 2007, meaning his background would not have been checked when he entered Britain.

A profile of Georgiev on the Interpol website listed him as being 1.78 metres tall, with greying hair and 'black' eyes.

His place of birth is listed as Pleven, Bulgaria, and Interpol state he is wanted for 'life and health' offences.

A Met Police spokesperson confirmed a 43-year-old man is being held over a Bulgarian murder at a London police station.

Describing Georgiev, one source told a Bulgarian newspaper:

'The Boxer fought his competitors with brutal ferocity.

'He tried to expand his group's scope. If threats did not work, he would quickly resort to the knife and physical violence.

'Those who refused to work for the gang were brutally beaten.'
