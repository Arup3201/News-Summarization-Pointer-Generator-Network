A 19-year-old man and his 20-year-old pregnant wife have been charged in connection to the slaying of a state trooper who was shot dead during a routine traffic stop in northern Michigan.

Trooper Paul Butterfield, 43, was shot in the head during in Mason County’s Sherman Township, about 80 miles north of Grand Rapids.

Eric Knysz, of Luther, was charged Wednesday with murder of an officer as well as three other crimes. His wife, Sarah Knysz, faces two charges related to driving away from the scene with him.

‘It appears to be simply a routine traffic stop ... one that we see on the road all the time,’ prosecutor Paul Spaniola told reporters.

Spaniola said Eric Knysz was not wanted by authorities when Butterfield stopped the pickup truck.

‘A lot of times homicides have no good reason,’ Spaniola said.

Mrs Knysz, who appeared in court by video camera from the county jail, won’t be released unless she posts $250,000.

‘The circumstances arising from this matter merit a much more serious bond,’ Magistrate Patricia Baker said, explaining the high figure.

Mr Knysz was shot in the knee while exchanging gunfire with police as officers closed in on the couple some 15 miles from where Butterfield was shot.

He’s in a Traverse City hospital but was expected to appear in court Thursday. He has a long criminal record that includes a laundry list of charges ranging from domestic violence to a home invasion, records show.

‘Good paying job trimming trees, wife that is pregnant, just moved into their own place,’ Knysz family friend Demo Moore told TV station WZZM. ‘Things were looking up. Then this happens.’

Eric's father, former police officer John Knyzs, also spoke to the station, apologizing for his son's alleged actions.

Eric and Sarah Knysz got married in February 2012. According to her Facebook page, the 20-year-old mom-to-be is currently about six months pregnant.

Spaniola said Butterfield regularly handled cases in Mason County, especially following up with sex offenders to ensure they were complying with their many restrictions.

‘He had a very soft spot for animals. He was a hard worker. He did everything by the book,’ the prosecutor said.

Butterfield’s funeral will be held Saturday at 1pm at Manistee High School. He was a trooper for 14 years and also served in the Army.

According to records cited by the station WOOD-TV, Knysz committed his first crime at age 14 when he and two other teens broke into a house, and the boy used a gun to shoot open a door.

Knysz was sentenced to a year in jail, but ended up serving only 29 days after a judge suspended most of his jail time.

The same scenario played out in three subsequent cases involving Knysz: each time, the teenager had most or all of his sentence suspended.

All told, the 19-year-old father-to-be has been sentenced to 1,006 days behind bars since 2008, but served only 34.  

Lake County Prosecutor Craig Cooper said he never would have predicted Knysz would be accused of killing a state trooper based on his rap sheet.
