US home prices rose 12.4 per cent in August from a year ago, the second straight month to post such a gain.

Despite a second straight strong year on year gain, experts fear the housing recovery may be peaking as mortgage rates rise and month to month gains are slowing.

Home prices rose 0.9 per cent from July to August, compared to a 1.8 per cent rise from June to July, according to CoreLogic, a data and analytics company.

On the rise: Home prices continue to rise as supplies fail to meet demand in many areas

Home prices rose in every state and in 99 out of the 100 metro areas surveyed by CoreLogic, the one exception being Akron, OH – which reported a decline.

This report came on the back of a 12.4 per cent rise in home prices the previous month, compared to a year ago, according to the Standard &Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index.

All 20 cities surveyed posted gains from both the previous month and compared with a year ago.Despite the continuing upward trend in home prices, the month to month numbers aren’t as bullish, a trend experts see continuing into the coming months.

As mortgage rates continue to rise, they are a full point higher than in May, and more homes are built, the supply should catch up to the demand in many locales, according to Stan Humphries, chief economist for Zillow.

‘This ongoing moderation is good for the market overall,’ Mr Humphries added.

The average 30-year mortgage rate was 4.3 per cent last week, according to Freddie Mac. That’s s light drop from the 4.5 per cent rate seen last week and the 4.58 per cent high seen last month.

Some analysts feel they may drop further after the Fed announced last month it would continue quantitative easing – federal buying of toxic bonds and mortgage backed securities.

Mortgage rates are expected to rise once quantitative easing comes to an end, perhaps as early as this year.

The rise in home sales was likely fueled by historically low mortgage rates
