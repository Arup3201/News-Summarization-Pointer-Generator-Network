Gus Poyet says he is not responsible for the strength of his squad at Sunderland as the fallout from their 8-0 humiliation at Southampton continues.

Captain John O’Shea has confirmed that the players will refund supporters the cost of their match tickets - an estimated £60,000 – or make a donation to charity.

The defender said: ‘We win and lose as a team, players, staff and fans. However, we wanted to acknowledge and thank the supporters who travelled such a long way to give us their backing and despite everything, stayed with us until the final whistle.’

Poyet, meanwhile, has indicated that he has been left short this season despite nine new faces arriving at the Stadium of Light.

But the Uruguayan wanted more having seen several senior players leave on free transfers - including Jack Colback, Phil Bardsley, Craig Gardner, Carlos Cuellar and David Vaughan - and Fabio Borini return to Liverpool following a successful loan stay.

Sporting director Lee Congerton is the man responsible for overseeing recruitment – answering to owner Ellis Short - and he stated during the close-season that ‘quality’ and not ‘quantity’ was the club’s summer strategy.

The Black Cats subsequently spent £14million – headlined by £10m Jack Rodwell from Manchester City – but Poyet repeatedly warned that a difficult season would lie in store unless key areas were strengthened.

And the former Chelsea and Spurs midfielder now appears to have distanced himself from the club’s transfer business.

‘I’m a head coach,’ he said. ‘I don’t make the squad, that’s not my job.

‘I’ve got four defenders, I play what I’ve got.

‘I’ll take responsibility at a set-piece – it was me, I pick the team and put it on the pitch.

‘The rest, I’m sorry, I’m not going to take.’

Saturday’s scoreline equalled Sunderland’s worst defeat in their history and they now take on Arsenal at home on Saturday where Poyet is set to make changes to the starting XI.

Goalkeeper Vito Mannone faces the axe with deputy Costel Pantilimon – a free-transfer signing from Manchester City – poised to come in having made his first start for the Under-21s during Monday’s 1-0 win over Leicester City, a match watched by Poyet.

The head coach, however, remains short of options with defenders Billy Jones and Sebastian Coates and attacking midfielders Ricky Alvarez and Emmanuele Giaccherini currently sidelined because of injury.

Will Buckley was brought in by Poyet for £2.5m from his former club Brighton and the winger says the team has to make amends for their ‘Sunday League’ display at St Mary’s.

‘We need to pick ourselves up and make sure our performance is 100 times better than it was at Southampton,’ he said.

‘I’ve never experienced anything like that professionally. It’s a horrible feeling, especially for how many fans we brought down.

‘It’s gutting for us and we let ourselves down. We need to make it right on Saturday.

‘Those are the kind of results you see in Sunday League, so we have to make sure that doesn’t happen again.

‘We let the manager down and all the staff who have shown good faith in us. We need to make sure we put that right.’
