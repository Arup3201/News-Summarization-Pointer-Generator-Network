American audiences will see a much racier version of the BBC's latest historical drama, White Queen. 

Max Irons, who plays King Edward in the drama admitted that the 'cameras kept rolling' in the version for the United States.

The £25 million costume drama  tells the story of the decades-long fight between the Houses of York and Lancaster for the English throne.

Saucier: The White Queen based on the War of The Roses its depiction of the coming together of King Edward of York (Max Irons) and Lancastrian, Lady Elizabeth Grey, played by Rebecca Ferguson

Starring roles: David Oakes as George, Duke of Clarence, left, and right, Max Irons as King Edward IV

Based on three of author Philippa Gregory’s best-selling novels about the Wars of the Roses, it a co-production between the BBC and American commercial channel Starz.

'There’s the BBC cut and the Starz cut,’ he told the Metro newspaper. 

‘You get a lot more arse in the Starz version – the cameras kept rolling after the BBC stopped the scene.’

He also said the U.S company needed different lines.

‘The other funny thing with Starz was that you had to do extra lines.

'For the BBC, I’d say to my brother: “Come here, George.” But for Starz 
it would be: “Come here George, Duke of Clarence,’ so they’d know what I
was on about.’

A spokesman for the series told the The Daily Telegraph that the camera had kept rolling for an additional 30 seconds 'on two or three ' occasions, but emphasised no extra scenes had been written.

The movie was filmed on location in Bruges, Belgium and spans 10 episodes.

It has been hyped as 'one of the most ambitious series the BBC has made”, according to its “Controller of Drama', Ben Stephenson.

Last night's episode saw Irons take his shirt off as he became intimate with Lady Elizabeth. 

The latest television hit, Game of Thrones was also inspired by the War of The Roses, according to its creator George RR Martin.
