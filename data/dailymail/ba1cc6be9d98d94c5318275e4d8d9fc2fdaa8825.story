The past 12 months have been the worst for aviation fatalities so far this decade - with the total of number of people killed if airline crashes reaching 1,050 even before the Air Asia plane vanished.

Two incidents involving Malaysia Airlines planes - one over eastern Ukraine and the other in the Indian Ocean - led to the deaths of 537 people, while an Air Algerie crash in Mali killed 116 and TransAsia Airways crash in Taiwan killed a further 49 people. 

The remaining 456 fatalities were largely in incidents involving small commercial planes or private aircraft operating on behalf of companies, governments or organisations. 

Despite 2014 having the highest number of fatalities so far this decade, the total number of crashes was in fact the lowest since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949 - totalling just 111 across the whole world over the past 12 months. 

The all-time deadliest year for aviation was 1972 when a staggering 2,429 people were killed in a total of 55 plane crashes - including the crash of Aeroflot Flight 217, which killed 174 people in Russia, and Convair 990 Coronado, which claimed 155 lives in Spain.

However this year's total death count of 1,212, including those presumed dead on board the missing Air Asia flight, marks a significant rise on the very low 265 fatalities in 2013 - which led to it being named the safest year in aviation since the end of the Second World War.

2014 has been a horrific year for Malaysia-based airlines, with 537 people dying on Malaysia Airlines planes, and a further 162 people missing and feared dead in this week's Air Asia incident. 

In total more than half the people killed in aviation incidents this year had been flying on board Malaysia-registered planes.

In January a total of 12 people lost their lives in five separate incidents, while the same number of crashes in February killed 107. 

There were only three fatal incidents in March, but the still-unexplained incident involving Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 left 239 people dead, bringing the total to 248.

April saw two incidents with a total of 10 people killed, before a spike in incidents in May saw five fatal crashes leading to 35 people losing their lives, and seven crashes in June killed 64.

July was by far the worst month for aviation fatalities this year, with a Malaysia Airlines plane being shot down over eastern Ukraine killing 298 people, 116 people dying in an Air Algérie downing  in Mali, and 48 dead in the TransAsia Airways crash in Taiwan. Two other crashes killed six people bringing the total dead in airline incidents in July to 468.

In August five crashes led to the deaths of 60 people, before a decline in September saw three downed planes and 12 killed, and three October incidents resulted in the deaths of 10 people. A further two crashes in November saw 11 people lose their lives.

Before the disappearance of the Air Asia flight there had already been three fatal plane crashes this month, killing 13 people. Air Asia flight QZ8501 had 155 passengers on board and seven crew - all of whom are missing and feared to be dead.

Horror: 298 people were killed when Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was shot out of the sky in July

Despite the heavy death toll, 2014 actually had the lowest number of crashes since the first commercial jet airliner took off in 1949 - just 111 in the past 12 months.

'It will probably come as a surprise to most people, but really it was a very safe year,' Paul Hayes, of the flight consultancy business Ascend told the Wall Street Journal.

Over the past 65 years, the aviation accident rate has been declining rapidly, despite more and more people taking to the skies every year. The current crash rate is 2.1 for every million planes that takes the skies - with the odds even lower on large commercial aircraft.

However the distressing disappearance of AirAsia flight QZ8501 is the latest installment in Indonesia's checkered airline history which has seen the deaths of almost 650 people in 20 years.

The nation has struggled with its air safety record over the past two decades as the airline market in Southeast Asia faced unparalleled demand for low-cost flights from a rapidly expanding population. 

While Indonesia has benefited economically from the growing market, it is struggling to meet safety standards, unable provide enough qualified pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and updated airport technology to ensure safety.

Despite 30 per cent of plane crashes around the world occurring as a result of weather conditions, ground-based wind-shear detection systems introduced to notify plane crews to issues are absent in many airports around Indonesia. 

The nation of over 250 million people is set in a region which 'needs to look at improving air infrastructure and pursue an open skies policy,' Mr Niemeijer told Quartz.     

The Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation recorded a 20% increase in seat volume between 2012 and 2013, totalling 5.6 million passengers on flights in the region.

The figures are expected to increase, with 70% of the world's busiest routes travelling through Southeast Asia, and 30% of the world's aircraft passengers expected to travel to the region in 2014, reported Orient Aviation Journal.

Crash site: Another incident in July saw an Air Algerie plane come down in Mali

116 people died in the Air Algerie crash earlier this year. The plane crashed in the same month as MH17

Willem Niemeijer, co-founder of Khiri Travel Group, said that 'increasing air traffic means crashes will increase as well.' 

In the past 20 years 532 people have died in crashes in Indonesia, and 116 people have been presumed dead. 

In 2014 so far there have been five major plane crashes in Southeast Asia, including the doomed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 en route to Kuala Lumpur, and the disappearance of MH370 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur. 

There has been one major flight incident in Indonesia annually for the past three years, including the disappearance of the AirAsia flight on Sunday which was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members on board.
