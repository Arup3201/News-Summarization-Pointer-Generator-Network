Healthy snack: The cookie, baked for website MuscleFoods, is designed for slimmers who don't want to give up their treats

It could be the tasty way to lose weight.

A chocolate chip cookie packed with as much protein as two chicken breasts is being billed as a new weapon in the fight against flab.

Designed for slimmers who can’t give up their treats, its high protein content should help slimmers feel fuller for longer.

The chocolate chip cookie is also lower in fat, sugar and calories than usual.

Despite this, it is claimed taste isn’t compromised – and the fact that they have sold out three times in the past month seems to bear testament to this.

Baked in Wales for specialist food website MuscleFood, the biscuits weigh a whopping 77g.

Some 40g of this – or more than half of it – is made up of soy, milk and other proteins, following research suggesting that the nutrient is especially good at keeping hunger pangs at bay.

Fat is reduced by using cocoa powder rather than milk chocolate and an artificial sweetener helps keep the amount of sugar used to under a teaspoon per cookie.

However, they don’t come cheap, at £19.95 for a box of ten – or almost £2 each.

Darren Beale, of MuscleFood.com said: ‘We’re a nation of biscuit lovers but we have become far more conscious about what put into our bodies.

‘We were determined to create a product that could stand up to leading High Street brands in terms of taste and texture but with greater nutritional benefits.

‘These cookies will complement hard work in the gym and efforts to shed pounds.’

Frankie Phillips, a spokesman for the British Dietetic Association, agreed that studies have shown protein to be particularly satisfying.

However, despite the efforts made, the cookies are still high in fat and calories, with a single cookie containing as many calories as a dieter’s entire lunch.

She said: ‘For my money, I’d rather people went for a low-fat yoghurt and a sandwich.’

Mike Lean, professor of human nutrition at Glasgow University, described the protein content as ‘huge’.

He said: ‘That is very remote from the type of food which humans evolved to eat, and very high protein foods put the kidneys under pressure - in rare cases resulting in serious renal failure.  So I would not want to eat this type of cookie.’
