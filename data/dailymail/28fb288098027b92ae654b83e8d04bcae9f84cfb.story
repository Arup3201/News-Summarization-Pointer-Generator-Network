This is the moment a young man and his friend posed for a video selfie in front of a dumpster blaze in Connecticut - only to be struck in the head by a powerful jet of water from a firefighter's hose.

Thomas Lavery and Krystine Hall, who are both believed to work at Apple, were walking through New Haven on Sunday when they spotted firefighters tackling a raging fire outside a restaurant.

But instead of standing back to allow the crew to deal with the blaze - which had started in a dumpster outside the pizza joint - they decided to capture themselves on video in front of it. 

Not a good idea: This is the moment Thomas Lavery and Krystine Hall posed for a video selfie in front of a dumpster blaze in Connecticut - only to be struck in the head by a stream of water from a firefighter's hose

In the footage, later posted to YouTube by Mr Lavery, the pair are seen posing and smiling just feet away from the fire. Mr Lavery tells the camera, 'it's a fire', as his friend pulls a series of faces.

Mr Lavery and Ms Hall then burst into fits of laughter after the latter realizes her colleague is taking a video, not a photo. Mr Lavery then tells her: 'I just wanted to see them [the firefighters] get it out.'

He goes on to say, 'here we go', as a firefighter picks up a water hose and aims it at the blaze. But seconds later, his words are drowned out as the stream of water strikes the pair on the head.

Both Mr Lavery and Ms Hall are heard screaming loudly as they are forced out of the shot, while the video cuts out almost immediately. A final clip shows the screen of the camera covered in water.

The incident, which occurred on the same day as New Haven's St Patrick's Day parade, is believed to have been captured on Mr Lavery's phone. He later posted the YouTube link on Facebook.

Many of his friends  deemed the video - which Mr Lavery captioned, 'just another day in New Haven' - 'hilarious' and 'amazing', while others commented on the 'unexpected' stream of water at the end. 

On his Facebook page, Mr Lavery, who lives in Milford, suggests he works at Apple Inc, while Ms Hall, from New Haven, lists her occupation as a 'Family Room Specialist' at the technology firm.

No further details on the dumpster blaze are known.
