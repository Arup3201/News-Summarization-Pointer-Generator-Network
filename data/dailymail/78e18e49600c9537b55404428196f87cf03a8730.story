A couple who took their children on a term-time holiday to Corfu after a 'traumatic' year have been dragged into court and fined £240. 

Roy and Jenny Davies pulled son Alistair, 14, and daughter Rhiannon, 13, out of school for a week so they could enjoy some much-needed 'quality time'.

The holiday followed a stressful year in which a family member died and Mrs Davies underwent emergency surgery which left her unable to walk.

While the family deemed their circumstances 'exceptional', Alistair's school did not agree, fining the parents £60.

Roy and Jenny Davies were fined £240 for taking their children Alistair, 14, and Rhiannon, 13, out of school for a holiday to Corfu after a 'traumatic year'

Mr and Mrs Davies, from Cheddar, refused to pay, leading Somerset County Council to prosecute the pair.

Magistrates in Taunton, Somerset, said they 'sympathised' with the couple but imposed a fine of £240 plus costs - a total of £290. 

The true cost is likely to be far higher, with self-employed welder Mr Davies missing out on an estimated further £300 from two full days of work spent in court thanks to their original hearing being adjourned.

The couple say they are furious at the way they have been treated by Alistair's school - Kings of Wessex Academy, in Cheddar - particularly as Rhiannon's school took no action over her absence.

They decided to take the holiday after a traumatic 15 months. Three days after the funeral of Mr Davies' father, Mrs Davies was rushed to hospital with a cyst on one of her ovaries. 

An operation to remove it forced the mother-of-two to stop working as she spent 10 months on heavy painkillers - before having a further operation on her toe because of arthritis. 

Alistair's school imposed a fine on the Davies family for taking the holiday, which came after a death in the family and Mrs Davies undergoing emergency surgery

Mr Davies said: 'We needed quality time as a family as the children had a very dramatic 18 months. The children spent their summer holidays running around and fetching things for their mum.

'If we had been worried about their education, we would not have taken them out of school.' 

As a result of the crackdown on term-time absences imposed by former Education Secretary Michael Gove in September 2013, headteachers can no longer grant up to 10 days’ holiday a year.

Instead, they can allow leave only in ‘exceptional circumstances’

Each parent who ignores a ban faces a £60 fine per child, rising to £120 if it is not paid within 21 days.

Failure to pay the fine can result in prosecution, with a maximum fine – if convicted – of £2,500 or a jail sentence of up to three months.

The move was intended to stop families damaging their children’s education by taking them away when holiday firms offer cheaper holidays.

A quarter of primary schools have punished parents for ignoring bans. 

The couple booked a holiday to Corfu for October last year, which involved taking the children out of school for a week.

Mrs Davies, 47, said: 'We wanted to take the holiday with the half term holidays, but it doubles in price. It's crazy.'

Rhiannon's school, Fairlands Middle School in Cheddar,  raised no objection but Alistair's school warned they could face a fine.

Alistair has good grades so the family thought his absence would not affect his long-term prospects.

Mrs Davies said: 'My son was getting so stressed out on the holiday, worrying that he'd have so much work to catch up on.

'I told him we'd figure it out together. But he didn't get any extra homework or any work to help him to catch up.' 

When they returned home they were each slapped with £60 fines, which doubled to £120 each when they failed to pay within 21 days.

Last week they appeared in the dock at Taunton Magistrates' Court in Somerset, where they both pleaded guilty.

Mr Davies, 42, showed the court letters and postcards praising Alistair for his grades and hard work at the school.

Magistrate Charis Cavaghan-Pack said she 'sympathised' with the family but it 'would not be in the interest of justice' to let them off. 

Alistair's school - Kings of Wessex Academy - imposed a £60 fine on the parents, who refused to pay

Rhiannon's school - Fairlands Middle School - accepted the family's exceptional circumstances and allowed the 13-year-old to have a week off

They were fined £240 - £120 per adult per child per week of absence - plus £30 costs and a £20 victim surcharge.

After the hearing, Mrs Davies said: 'We think there were exceptional circumstances and while the school argued that it affected Alistair's grades, we proved it wasn't the case with several postcards and letters from the school.

'The court hasn't taken into consideration that Roy has lost two days of work as a self-employed welder and fabricator and work has been quiet the last few months. It's difficult.'

A spokesman for Somerset County Council defended the decision to bring the case to court.

'When a case like this ends up in court it is the bench who decides on a verdict and appropriate sentence after considering all the evidence and any mitigating circumstances.

'We believe every child deserves the very best education and this is why we work closely with schools on attendance which in a small number of cases results in penalty notices being issued.'

Neither school was available for comment this afternoon.

Parents have campaigned for holiday prices to be slashed now legislation stops families from taking time off during term time.

More than 170,000 people have signed a petition calling on the Government to force holiday companies to cut their prices, meaning it could be debated in Parliament. 

As many as two-fifths of parents would flout the rules so they can get a cheaper summer holiday, a poll found last year.

One frustrated father Paul Cookson, 41, was inspired to speak out after trying to book a trip to Center Parcs with his seven-year-old daughter Phoebe.

His Facebook rant  about perceived 'rip-off' prices went viral, with outraged parents sharing the post more than 143,000 times.

‘I think I’ve touched a nerve with this one,’ he said. ‘I don’t see why I should be penalised for sticking to the rules.’

Martin Dalby, from Centre Parcs, said: ‘What we are doing is flexible pricing,’ he says. ‘In the summer I could sell the place twice over and the prices reflect the high level of demand.’

He adds: ‘It’s best to see it as me dropping prices off-peak to stimulate demand.’
