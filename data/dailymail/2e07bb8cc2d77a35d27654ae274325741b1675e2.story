Great English Football Managers of the 21st Century. As one of the world’s shortest football books it would be right up there with Popular ground-sharing schemes and England’s penalty shootout successes.

No English manager has won the Premier League (Howard Wilkinson was the last to win the top flight in 1992) and none have won the European Cup since Joe Fagan in 1984. In last year’s Champions League not a single English boss featured in the last 16 and this season will be no different.

But there will be one 42-year-old coach in the mix who hails from south-west London. A man who finds himself No 2 at the No 1 club in world football at the moment; although how long he stays as an assistant manager will depend on him.

Paul Clement was a PE teacher in Sutton in 2000 when he got the chance to coach part-time at Chelsea’s youth academy. He took his UEFA coaching badges while still working full time as a teacher and moving slowly up the pecking order at Stamford Bridge, at Fulham’s academy, and then back at Chelsea again under Carlo Ancelotti, winning the Premier League.

The Italian coach who last May became only the second manager in history to win the European Cup three times saw something in Clement, whose dad Dave played for QPR and England and brother Neil for West Brom, that made sure he took him with him to Paris Saint-Germain and then to Real Madrid at the start of last season.

Clement has no playing background but that never stopped Arsene Wenger, Rafa Benitez and Jose Mourinho and maybe it’s time England's search for great homegrown managers went beyond those who have played the game at a high level.

Although football fans below a certain age might struggle to believe it England has managed to produce decent international teams in the not too distant past with the so-called Golden Generation of 2002 and two Paul Gascoigne-inspired sides in1990 and 1996 that both reached big semi-finals.

But from those three sides not a single top manager has emerged with Stuart Pearce, Terry Butcher, Tony Adams and Paul Ince all at least having given it a go and verdicts still pending on the likes of David Platt, Gary Neville and Gareth Southgate.

Clement told Sportsmail in an interview last year that as a player: 'It’s only natural to think about yourself first and foremost but that when you are learning to be a coach you think about the bigger picture all the time'.

He has had that bigger picture in mind for over a decade now and the rise from Chelsea’s Under-16s coach to the man who found himself scribbling down the list of potential Real Madrid penalty takers in last season’s Champions League final has been extraordinary.

The way he has won the trust of Ancelotti and the respect of some of the biggest names in the game, from Didier Drogba and Ashley Cole to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Cristiano Ronaldo, has some of the Premier League’s biggest clubs monitoring his situation.

With every season that passes his name seems to be linked with a bigger team. Last year as he helped guide Real to win the Copa del Rey the whispers started that Brighton and Fulham wanted him.

Last May as he helped guide Madrid to Champions League final glory in Lisbon, his name was mentioned as a possible long-term QPR manager. West Brom also emerged as a candidate for his signature after the club decided not to continue with Pepe Mel.

The QPR link will not go away because of his late-father’s playing career that included 470 first team appearances. The club won promotion back to the Premier League on the same day Madrid won their 10th European Cup last May and he described the double triumph as “the perfect day”.

Two weeks ago it was even suggested that Arsenal are considering turning to Clement to replace Arsene Wenger at the end of next season. 'I think it’s soon,' he said last May when asked about when he would be making the step up to becoming a number one.

'A few opportunities have come my way. But this [Madrid] is a difficult place to leave. It’s a great club, a great city, a great tradition and it gives you the opportunity to win things.'

Replacing Wenger in two years would certainly make sense in terms of timing. While currently very happy and successful at Madrid, managerial cycles at the Santiago Bernabeu rarely last longer than three years so it would be time for Ancelotti and his team to move on.

Clement would have spent another two seasons alongside one of the most successful coaches in history and with some of the current crop at Real Madrid two years older some might even be ready for a Premier League swansong.

Asked last season if he would take a couple of Galaticos with him when he finally jumped ship he joked: 'That’s what managers do, isn’t it?' Arsenal could probably do with a Pepe and a Sami Khedira right now without having to wait until the end of next season.

Brilliant No 2s don’t always make top No 1s but Arsenal have shown they are willing to take managerial risks in the past – they plucked Arsene Wenger from the J-League two decades ago after all. And there will be other clubs ready to take the gamble.

Clement will not be holding his breath a phone call – from Arsenal or from anyone else, he has plenty on his plate with the aim of becoming the first team to retain the Champions League the club’s big aim.

After last season’s post-Champions League final chat with reporters sparked stories of his imminent departure Sportsmail got in contact with the 42-year-old coach to see how far down the line exit plans were and the 'it’s Madrid for me' was the brief but to the point answer. 

It looks like being that way for the foreseeable future, but he will not be there forever, and as one of Europe’s most wanted managers-in-the-making there will be no shortage of suitors when the time comes.
