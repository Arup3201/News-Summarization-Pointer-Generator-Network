While Star Wars fans around the world celebrated May the 4th - international Star Wars Day - with screenings and costumes, Los Angeles-based fanatic Dan Steininger did so with a very unique approach.

The Lego Master Builder - one of only seven in the world - flew into Australia from the US to break the world record for the largest Darth Vader and Yoda figures ever created with the colourful building blocks. 

His Darth Vader figure stood at four metres high and Yoda at two metres - an impressive feat for the 58-year-old who gets 'paid to play'.

Steininger's story is a one kidault dreams are made of.

First exposed to Lego when his son was seven-years-old, he became so passionate about the medium that he left a lucrative job in sales for a 'minimum wage' entry-level position at the Lego store.

'I had four kids at the time, a mortgage, and when I told my wife that I wanted to leave a job where I made twice as much to build Lego for a living she was like "You want to do what exactly?"' he told MailOnline.

'I wish I could explain it, but I think there's something in snapping those bricks together that’s so satisfying.

'In my mind, it's all that’s right with the world: you snap those two bricks together and it fits, it's a solid connection.

'It’s a good feeling.'

Several years on, the risk has paid off for Steininger who is one of only seven Lego Master Builders in the world and is flown around the globe to create impressive models for children and parents alike.

'The simplest way to explain it is I get paid to play,' he said.

'When my kids were young and in school I had rock star status.

'When you meet mum and dads they get so excited that someone gets paid to do what their child has a passion for. 

'I came from a background in art and sculpting, but a lot these kids go on to work in architecture or engineering as they have that gift to see things in three dimensions.'

Enduring popularity: The Star Wars saga has gone on to become a pop cultural icon

Visiting Australia for May the 4th Star Wars celebrations was a dream come true for Steininger, who considers George Lucas' seminal space opera one of his other passions.

'There were lines around the block to see the movie, which was unheard of at the time,' he said, talking about the first 1977 release.

'I remember seeing Star Wars IV: A New Hope with friends and walking out of the cinema taking about how we needed to immediately go and see it again because there were no doubt things that we missed.

'The good versus evil narrative, this little Yoda character stealing the hearts of young and old alike, it became a cultural icon.'

Role call: The film's original stars (L - R) Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are returning for the new series of Star Wars movies

With the original trilogy - the prequel films - and now a whole new set of three films to be directed by Star Trek and Lost filmmaker J.J. Abrams, Steininger said he's excited to see 'new life' brought to the saga.

'To have fresh eyes looking at it and Disney involved as they own the rights, there's definitely opportunity there,' he said.

The cast of the new Star Wars saga includes original stars Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Peter Mayhew, with newcomers John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver and Domhnall Gleeson added to the mix.
