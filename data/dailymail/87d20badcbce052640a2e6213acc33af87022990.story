Millwall have dismissed manager Ian Holloway and installed club legend Neil Harris as they attempt to try and avoid relegation from The Championship.

Chairman John Berylson and the board are believed to have lost patience with Holloway following Saturday's 4-1 home defeat against Norwich City and a decision was announced on Tuesday morning.

Harris scored a club record 138 goals in 432 appearances for The Lions and currently works at The New Den coaching their elite development squad.

He served as caretaker-manager last season after Millwall sacked Steve Lomas before appointing Holloway.

The dismissal of Holloway is a devastating blow to one of football's most colourful and quotable managers.

Known throughout the game as 'Olly', he helped Blackpool win promotion to the Premier League where they were only relegated on the final day with a defeat at Manchester United.

But since leaving Broomfield Road, Holloway was sacked by Crystal Palace and things haven't gone well at Millwall this season.

The club have picked up only two wins from 15 matches and are eight points from safety.

He was booed by fans at the weekend and now his 14-month tenure at the club is over.
