A daring female cop risked her own life to pull a girl to safety after she perched four stories up on a ledge.

Officer Brandy Thwing forgot her own fear of heights, to grab the girl and pull her to safety in downtown Phoenix, Arizona on Monday afternoon.

Five police officers inched carefully along an exposed edge to reach the girl who appeared distressed as she dangled her legs over the edge of the Sheraton hotel restaurant.

The cop edged towards the girl to grab her at a second's notice, putting her own safety at risk 

The officer dragged the girl back from the edge. She was later taken to hospital for evaluation following concerned 911 calls on Monday 

Officer Thwing told KVOA: 'I didn't look down. I just kept looking step by step and focused on the direction I wanted to go.'

The 13-year veteran of the force shrugged off her heroics and said it was just another day on the job.

However her fear of heights returned as she carefully left the roof with the help of other officers and a ladder.  

The girl, who was not identified, was taken to hospital for evaluation. 

Police had been called to the scene by frantic 911 calls where witnesses said that the girl appeared distressed.
