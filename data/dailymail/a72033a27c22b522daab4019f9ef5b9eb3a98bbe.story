A British family on holiday in France ‘could have died’ after thieves piped gas from a car exhaust into their camper van to knock them unconscious before robbing them.

Linda Chadwick and five members of her family had stopped for the night near Bourges when robbers broke into the vehicle and stole a suitcase, mobile phones, jewellery and £1,900 in cash.

The family, from Oakwood, Derby, woke up with severe headaches and sore throats to find their mobile home had been raided.

Victims: Linda and Darren Chadwick, their son Jamie, Jani Horsley and Mandy and Steve Willows were knocked out by thieves who pumped exhaust fumes into their caravan while they camped in France

Mrs Chadwick, was with husband Darren, 40, son Jamie, 21, his girlfriend, Janie Horsley, 17, her brother, Stephen Willows, 50, and sister-in-law, Mandy Willows, 46, when the shocking incident took place.

The family were on their way back from Spain and had parked up for the night at a service station on the A71, just after midnight.

The summer heat had made the group restless and unable to sleep. Mrs Chadwick says the last thing she remembers is seeing the lights of a car at 4.40am before ‘zoning out’.

‘We all woke up at around about the same time, at 6am, with terrible headaches and really sore throats. We were all in shock. It was so awful.

‘My brother, who was on the bottom bunk, said “Where's the suitcase?” We realised we had been robbed.’

They went to a nearby petrol station where the attendant called the police, and they were taken to a police station and on to the Centre Hospitalier De Saint Amand Montrond.

Linda said: ‘We were all seen individually by doctors and nurses and put into rooms where we were given oxygen and our blood samples were taken. We were in there nearly all of the day.

‘The person taking the blood said it could have killed us. It was horrendous. They said it could also lead to memory loss, flashbacks.’

Linda said the family had been given a report from the hospital saying that they had been affected by carbon monoxide.

She said doctors believed that was ‘more than likely’ from exhaust fumes. The family were taken back to the police station, where Linda said that police interviewed them individually and took their fingerprints.

Their ordeal follows reports of the same thing happening to another British couple near Marseilles.

Debbie Keeney and Bob John were  ten days into a month-long camper van trip when they were targeted on July 6.

The couple said they felt ‘violated and shaken’ but made a full recovery. Local police suspect they were gassed after receiving reports of Eastern European gangs preying on holidaymakers in the same way.

Linda said the police dealing with her incident, on Saturday, July 19, had told her how criminals used exhaust fumes to knock people out.

She said: ‘We were told they wait for you to get into the camper van at night.

‘Then they run a tube from their exhaust underneath the van where there are vents and the fumes get through there.’

Common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning resemble other types of poisonings and infections, including symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a feeling of weakness.

Affected families often believe they are victims of food poisoning. And neurological signs include confusion, disorientation, visual disturbance, syncope and seizures Linda said her family had still not fully recovered from the ordeal.

She added: ‘My brother has been waking up in the night.

‘He thinks they could have done anything to him because he was close to the door.’

Bourges police have confirmed they are investigating but have not yet made any arrests.
