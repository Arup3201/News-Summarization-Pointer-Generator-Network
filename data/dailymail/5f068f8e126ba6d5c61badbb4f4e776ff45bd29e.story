The man known as ‘Eoin Rogers’ in these parts is determined to make a name for himself by ending his run of dismal form and showing New Zealand that England really can play one-day cricket.

The slip of the tongue from Wellington’s English mayor Celia Wade-Brown somehow summed up Eoin Morgan’s anonymity during a horrid spell when he has not stayed at the crease long enough for anyone to take note of his name.

Morgan is not one to take offence at the mayor’s faux pas - ‘I’ve been called a lot worse,’ he smiled on Wednesday - but he knows how important it would be for him to make an indelible impression on New Zealand on Friday (1am GMT).

‘I’d love you to explain it because I don’t understand it,’ said Morgan of his run of four ducks in his last five innings. ‘I try to keep things simple. You don’t look any further than what’s in front of you and I’ve done that but it hasn’t worked.

‘I believe it will work and when it does hopefully I can cash in and make it either a match-winning performance or build on somebody else’s. I’ve certainly done the same things I’ve been doing since the start of the tour and I began it with a hundred. That’s only five games ago.’

It must seem like an eternity to Morgan despite his relaxed persona. He does not look short of confidence but he knows how erosive it can be for a captain to struggle having succeeded one who was struggling in Alastair Cook.

‘I think the fact I’ve been through bad patches before has helped,’ said Morgan, who lost his Test place three years ago when his technique collapsed against Pakistan. He is not the only one who needs a performance at the Westpac Stadium in a game where England need a vast improvement from their capitulation at the hands of Australia.

Last summer England’s Test form dramatically improved after a dismal start to the summer when the more experienced players found their feet and Morgan called on those around him to deliver now.

Before his run of two runs in five innings, Morgan reminded reporters again of his 121 in Sydney

‘Our senior players will need to stand up,’ said Morgan when looking ahead to the challenge of facing what looks like a formidable New Zealand side. ‘We didn’ t do it at the MCG which was disappointing. Guys like myself, Jimmy, Broady and Belly need to make contributions in order to make the young guys feel comfortable within themselves.

‘There is a sense of frustration. These first two games in particular are great practice for the later stages. If we can get wins under our belt against good opposition it can breed confidence for later in the tour.’

England might want to think about getting to those later stages first if they are convincingly beaten again.

Another defeat would crank up the pressure before they play Scotland in Christchurch on Monday in what would then be a game where England could not afford any slip ups. At least Morgan had one bit of good news in his recruitment by Sunrisers Hyderabad of the Indian Premier League this week, where he will play alongside Kevin Pietersen, Ravi Bopara and David Warner.

But even that is not without controversy because, as revealed by Charles Sale in Sports Agenda, it means Morgan will miss England’s one-day international against Ireland on May 8 because of a clash with the IPL. And he had said earlier on this tour that the IPL would not effect his England commitments.

‘The national selector (James Whitaker) and managing director (Paul Downton) have allowed guys who have got picked up in the IPL to miss that game in order to expose themselves to opportunities and learn more about their game.’

But surely the England captain is a different case? ‘No, I don’t think it is,’ insisted Morgan. ‘If you’re being a little short-sighted it might do but I think in the longer term it will serve me well.’

Well, call me myopic but I think that is wrong. Yes, the scheduling of the match in Dublin is ridiculous, straight after England’s Caribbean tour, but the captain should be with his team.

For now that issue can wait because Morgan might not even be England captain by then if his side go out in the first round of this World Cup.
