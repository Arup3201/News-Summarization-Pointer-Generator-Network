As a duchess, she could grandly demand an endless supply of different hats.

But that's not Kate's style. She scored a thriftiness hat trick yesterday, wearing the same jaunty headpiece for the third time in little over a year.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were in Edinburgh, where William was installed into the highest order of chivalry north of the border.

Kate, known in Scotland as the Countess of Strathearn, attends a Thistle
Service at St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh for the installation of The
Prince William, Earl of Strathearn, as a Knight of the Thistle

The colour of the Emilia Wickstead coat-dress, which was created especially for Kate ahead of the event, was an unusual choice for the duchess, who has only worn yellow in public once before

Elegant: Kate has shown a fondness for the New Zealand-born, British-based designer of late, and wore a pink Wickstead coat-dress twice in recent months

It was the couple's first official engagement as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn, the titles they use in Scotland.

In a typically thoughtful gesture, 
Kate carried with her a wrap made out of the clan's distinctive tartan. 
And she also displayed her trademark thrift in the £99 latte-coloured 
sisal cocktail hat, by Luton-based milliner Whiteley.

She first wore it at last year's 
Derby, and last month paired it with a pale embellished coat for the 
wedding of William's cousin, Emily McCorquodale.

Yesterday she wore a beautiful pale 
gold coat dress by society designer Emilia Wickstead, a favourite of the
Prime Minister's wife, Samantha Cameron.

The duchess recently sported a £1,200
Wickstead coat in pink, but this one, according to the designer, was 
made especially for her and would have cost significantly more.

Her husband, William, wore the moss green velvet gown and distinctive heron-plumed hat of the Order of the Thistle.

Kate's hat is by Luton-based milliner Whiteley, £99, supplied at Fenwick on Bond St, and is a style she has worn on a number of previous occasions

Just as she did on the day of the Jubilee flotilla, Kate carried a folded Strathearn scarf, a nod to her Scottish title

The Duchess of Cambridge last carried the folded Strathearn tartan scarf during the Jubilee flotilla last month, left, and in an identical manner today

The order, founded in 1687, is unique to Scotland. Unlike many national honours, it is in the personal gift of the Queen.

She made her grandson a Knight of the Thistle to mark both her Diamond Jubilee and his 30th birthday.

It is the 
highest honour in Scotland and is second only in precedence in the UK to
the Order of the Garter.

At her ears Kate wore a pair of simple gold and citrine drop earrings by jeweller Kiki McDonough

The order honours men and women who have held public office or who have contributed in a significant way to national life.

The Princess Royal was invested in the Order of the Thistle in June 2001.

The royal family entered the 
cathedral shortly before 11am to a fanfare, accompanied by other members
of the Order, all wearing ceremonial gowns.

Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge, took her place in the audience.

The hat worn by Kate today in Edinburgh was a 
fine, handwoven sisal straw beret in the colour 'latte' from Whiteley's 
eponymous Whiteley Collection

Her chocolate suede shoes were by British designer Emmy Scarterfield of Emmy Shoes

The installation ceremony was conducted by the Dean of the Thistle, Rev. Gilleasbuig Macmillan.

The short ceremony took place within the internal Thistle Chapel and was broadcast through speakers to those in the cathedral.

The Queen said: 'It is our pleasure 
that His Royal Highness the Prince William, Earl of Strathearn, be 
installed a Knight of the most ancient and most noble Order of the 
Thistle.'

The Queen and her husband are members
of the Scottish order of chivalry, as is Princess Anne. Only the 
Sovereign has the power to bring new members into the order, and it is 
an honour she may choose to bestow herself without seeking approval from
the Government.

Kate wore a coat dress by Emilia 
Wickstead in delicate primrose yellow - a colour often favoured by the 
Queen on joyous occasions. Indeed, the monarch chose yellow on the 
occasion of Kate and William's wedding last April.

Her
hat, by British milliner Whiteley, was one Kate has worn numerous times
before, and is a £99 sisal beret in latte.

The Queen was solely responsible for granting William membership to the 
order as it is an honour she can bestow independently of the Government

The pomp and pageantry of the Order of the Thistle ceremony dates back to the 1600s when it was founded by James VII of Scotland, also James II of England

The Queen said in the services it was her 'pleasure' that His Royal Highness the Prince William, Earl of Strathearn, be installed a Knight of the most ancient and most noble Order of the Thistle

The Order's vestements include a white taffeta-lined green velvet mantle worn over a suit or military uniform and tied with green and gold tassels, with the star of the Order on the left shoulder. The black velvet hat is trimmed with white ostrich feathers and a black egret or heron feather. A gold collar with thistles and rue sprigs is worn over the mantle, and the St Andrew, known as the 'badge-appendant' is attached to the collar

The Queen was accompanied by fellow Order of the Thistle members the Duke of Edinburgh, the Princess Royal and the Duke of Cambridge

Noble: The Queen and Prince Philip are also members of the Order of the Thistle, an order of chivalry unique to Scotland

Princess Anne is a member of the Order of the Garter as well as the Order of the Thistle, meaning she holds the highest honour in both Scotland and England

The Queen's white gown was made from richly textured silk, and at her neck she wore a diamond and emerald necklace

Noble: The insignia of the ancient Scottish Order of the Thistle

Like the Order of the Garter in England, the Order of the Thistle is a noble order of chivalry, but it is unique to Scotland.

The current order was founded in 1687 by King James VII of Scotland, also known as James II of England.

The Sovereign grants membership to the order, and need not seek approval from the Government.  

The Queen, Prince Philip and Princess Anne are Knights of the Thistle.

Male Knights of the Thistle may use the title Sir, while ladies can use Lady before their forename.

Wives of Knights may use Lady as a prefix to their surname, although peers and princes do not use these titles unless their names are written out in their fullest forms.

The motto of the order is Nemo me impune lacessit, which is translated as No one attacks me with impunity,  or alternatively No one can harm me unpunished.

The same motto appears on the Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom for use in Scotland and some pound coins. The same mottos is also used by the Royal Regiment of Scotland, Scots Guards, The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada and Royal Scots Dragoon Guards.

The Order's patron saint is St Andrew, and its emblem is a thistle, Scotland's national flower.

The Order's vestements include a white taffeta-lined green velvet mantle
worn over a suit or military uniform and tied with green and gold 
tassels, with the star of the Order on the left shoulder.

The black 
velvet hat is trimmed with white ostrich feathers and a black egret or 
heron feather. A gold collar with thistles and rue sprigs is worn over 
the mantle, and the St Andrew, known as the 'badge-appendant' is 
attached to the collar.

On the left shoulder of the mantle is a star badge bearing the motto of the Order, Nemo me impune lacessit (no one can harm me unpunished). The velvet hat is trimmed with ostrich feathers and one black egret or heron top feather in the centre

Society favourite: Designer Emilia Wickstead with loyal client Samantha Cameron

British based, New Zealand-born designer Emilia Wickstead has fast become one of the go-to designers for London's high society.In business just three years, Ms Wickstead has already dressed a number of royals - not least Kate, who wore an emerald Emilia Wickstead coat dress for a St Patrick's Day appearance earlier this year, and the same £1,200 pink coat dress on two occasions in the past two months - once for a Jubilee lunch at Windsor Castle, and again just two weeks later for a Buckingham Palace garden party. Kate has been spotted various times visiting the atelier in London's Belgravia, and is said to be a great fan of the brand.

Privately, Ms Wickstead is said to be delighted the Kate has shown interest in her collection.

Ms Wickstead also dressed a number of VIP guests invited to last year's Royal Wedding, including Kate's cousin Lucy; Anya Hindmarch; Georgina Cadbury; Lady Kitty Spencer, Emma Parker Bowles and India Hicks, who was a bridesmaid to Princess Diana.

But Emilia's client base is not restricted to the upper echelons royalty.

Ms Wickstead can also count Dannii Minogue and Samantha Cameron as trusted customers, both of whom have worn her designs on many occasions.Most recently, Samantha Cameron wore multiple pieces from Wickstead's collection on a visit to the U.S. in March.

The designer's spring/summer 2012 collection, a pretty collection in candybox hues, was described by Wickstead herself as being a 'mixture of sophistication and playfulness - fashionable women who entertain'.

'We are happy, delighted and excited to see Kate in one of our designs, a spokesman for Emilia Wickstead said recently, adding that she looked 'lovely' in the Wickstead designs.
