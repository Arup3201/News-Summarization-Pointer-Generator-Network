Witnesses who may have been too scared to talk to police investigating the murder of Stephen Lawrence will tonight be urged to help detectives catch those who continue to evade justice.

The plea for new information days after the 20th anniversary of Stephen’s stabbing will be made by the detective who last year helped convict two of Stephen’s killers, Gary Dobson and David Norris.

Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll will revisit the crime scene in Eltham, south-east London, where Stephen was killed on April 22, 1993, during a special BBC1 Crimewatch appeal on the case.

Stephen Lawrence was murdered 20 years ago and a special BBC1 Crimewatch appeal will be broadcast tonight for new information on the case

Police believe up to six white youths were involved in the racist attack, but only two have been convicted.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘Officers believe there were individuals in the vicinity of the murder who have never come forward.’

These include two men who got off a bus opposite where Stephen was attacked and walked south along the east side of Well Hall Road, a man who ran from the area of Well Hall Road roundabout to the bus stop on the same side of Well Hall Road as the attack, a man walking on the east side of Well Hall south of the roundabout, opposite the Coronet cinema, wearing a green jacket with a large ‘V’, and anyone else nearby, such as those outside the cinema or on buses.

The move piles pressure on the three thugs named as Stephen’s killers by the Mail in February 1997 – brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, and their friend Luke Knight, none of whom have been convicted.

The others named on the Mail’s famous ‘Murderers’ front page that month were Norris and Dobson, who in January last year were convicted of the 18-year-old’s killing after a forensic breakthrough.

Yesterday, it emerged Dobson claimed £200,000 in legal aid for Old Bailey hearings to do with the trial.

Anyone with information about Stephen’s murder can call the incident room on 020 8785 8310 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
