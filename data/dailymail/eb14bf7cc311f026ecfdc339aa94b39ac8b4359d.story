The fan who mysteriously died after he was found in someone else's car in the parking lot outside Sunday's Kansas City Chief's game was viciously pummeled by tailgaters, it was revealed.

The medical examiner's office has ruled Kyle Van Winkle's death a homicide - meaning he was killed by another person - though it has not made a decision on the cause of death.

The Kansas City Star reports that police are focusing their investigation on a 24-year-old tailgater as Van Winkle's primary attacker.

Tragic: Kyle Van Winkle, 30, was the father of a seven-week-old son. He died at the hospital

Detectives searched the man's home and arrested him - though he has not been formally charged and his name has not been released.

Van Winkle, the 30-year-old son of a Missouri police sergeant and a new father, died in the parking lot of Arrowhead Stadium Sunday after he left the Chiefs-Denver Brocos game.

His family says he got into an unlocked dark-colored Jeep in the parking lot that looked nearly identical to one of the vehicles his friend drove to the game. It was in the same row as his friend's vehicle - but 10 cars away.

When the owner of the Jeep arrived at his car with his 10-year-old son and found Van Winkle inside, he called for help - believing he had broken into the vehicle, according to police.

The Star reports that tailgaters who were watching the game on TV from the parking lot ran over and began beating Van Winkle.

One witness tried to stop the assault, but the tailgaters pushed him away.

One tailgater in particular, the 24-year-old who is now a suspect, showered Van Winkle with blows until he was unconscious, according to police. 

Someone propped him up, unconscious against a bus. 

The 24-year-old assailant and his friends went back to their tailgate party. The Jeep owner and his son left.

An unknown amount of time later, a bystander noticed that Van Winkle was turning blue.

Witnesses called paramedics - but it was too late. He died at the hospital.
