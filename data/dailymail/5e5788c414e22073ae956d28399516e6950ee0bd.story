Barcelona have renamed their first-team training pitch 'Camp Tito Vilanova' after their late coach and manager, who passed away last year from cancer.

Vilanova's family were at the ceremony, joining the entire Barcelona squad and his widow, Montse Chaure, thanked the club for the gesture.

'The best thing we can do when someone we love isn't here is remember them,' Chaure is quoted as saying in AS. 'He loved this pitch, he always said he was privileged to do something he enjoyed, which was coaching. He loved all these players.'

Vilanova was a loyal assistant to Pep Guardiola, from his days as coach of Barcelona B through to his trophy-laden tenure with senior team.

When Guardiola stepped down from his role as manager in 2012, it was Vilanova who replaced him at the helm of the club.

He led Barcelona to La Liga glory in his only season as manager, with his team reaching 100 points and finishing 15 ahead of Real Madrid, before his health forced him to step down.

Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu believes the training pitch will keep Vilanova's memory alive to future generations of Barca players.

'We all know who Tito Vilanova is, but putting his name on this pitch, all those who step on it in the future will know who he is; they will ask and we will tell them,' Bartomeu said.
