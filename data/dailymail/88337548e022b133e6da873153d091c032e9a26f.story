Not content with backflips or somersaults, this experienced slackliner strips off in mid-air.

While balancing on a rope with no safety net - and often no harness, Jaan Roose, from Estonia, rips off his shirt and pulls down his trousers to reveal his chiselled physique and underwear.

Roose, 22, has been a slackliner for four years, and travels the world capturing his daredevil stunts in photographs and videos.

The sport requires intense concentration to remain balanced on an unstable line that is anchored between two points.

Most participants attempt to cross the line without losing their balance, but Jaan likes to take things a step further.

The thrillseerker hurls himself into the air, twists and turns, and lands back on the rope - and even he jumps from one slackline to the other.

But his most impressive trick is surely the strip act he performs in which he kicks off his trainers, whips off his shirt and pulls his trousers down.

Jaan said: 'My first clothes off trick was in 2011, when I did it for the videos and then in competition. The trick was taking my shirt off.

'Years later I came back to this idea with the question, 'What other tricks can I do with clothes?'

'I had the idea for a long time to take clothes off while slacklining because nobody was doing it this way. And I was bored creating just high-level crazy tricks, most slackliners go this way, they try to make the craziest stuff.

'I wanted to keep doing crazy stunts, but not as dangerous or typical. I wanted to be more creative.

'People's reaction to this video was wonderful. The slackline community liked it as it was something new and fresh. People were saying. 'If Jaan Roose keeps being creative we'll have to censor the next video.
