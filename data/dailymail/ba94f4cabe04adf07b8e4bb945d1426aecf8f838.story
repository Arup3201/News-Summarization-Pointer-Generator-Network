A Mississippi man has been dubbed the 'pothole Robin Hood' after he stole asphalt from the city to fill in more than 100 potholes in his area.

Ron Chane owns a screen-printing business by day in Fondren but by night he and his girlfriend have taken it upon himself to smooth out crumbling roads in the city of Jackson.

Citizens are thrilled at the vigilante's work but the police less so. He is now under police investigation for stealing the asphalt from the city of Jackson and repairing the potholes, which he then signs with the spray-painted message 'citizen fixed.'

'It's sort of like Robin Hood. Once we saw that people were appreciating what we did, we went out again and made a goal of fixing 100 potholes,' he told ABC News. 'We've actually filled 101 potholes, so our mission has been completed.'

Potholes are widespread in all areas of Jackson and experts say they make cracks in the already crumbling streets. The city, which residents joke is like a Six Flags amusement park because it's so bumpy, also has a sinkhole problem. According to ABC, people and even a car have fallen into them in the past.

'It's hard to have a good city without good infrastructure,' Chane told ABC. 'And our city simply does not have the budget.'

The mysteriously filled potholes have
 sparked an investigation into where Chane got the asphalt, but the 
Jackson Police Department has not yet decided whether to press charges.

'This is all still under investigation. We're just trying to get more information,' Officer Colendula Greene told ABC News.

But Chane is proud of his work.

'I'm probably stealing from the city, but there's not a sign saying "Don't take this and put it in potholes." So I'm putting (the asphalt) back where it belongs,' he told MSN Now.

But Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumbaba doesn't look at the public crusader's act quite so favorably.

'We do not accept any use of the city's resources without going through the proper legal channels,' he told WAPT in a statement.

Lumbaba got elected on July 1 on the promise that he would repair and develop Jackson's streets, his campaign website says.

'Hopefully our new mayor and his administration will be aggressive in addressing this problem,' Chane said. 'He's got a tough road ahead.'

'We're sending a message that as citizens you have to sometimes take matters in your hands, in a creative and constructive way,' he added.
