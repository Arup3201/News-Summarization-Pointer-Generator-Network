West Indies have named six uncapped players in their provisional 30-man World Cup squad.

Alongside a host of familiar names, including the majority of the party who controversially abandoned their tour of India due to a dispute with the West Indies Cricket Board, the selectors have added new blood in all departments.

Veteran left-armer Kenroy Peters gets a surprise call alongside teenage paceman Marquino Mindley, spinners Imran Khan and Ashley Nurse, opener Evin Lewis and all-round Jonathan Carter.
