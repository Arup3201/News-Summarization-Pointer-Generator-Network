A 21-year-old man is heading to death row for his part in the grisly slaying of a Florida teenager that shocked the nation in 2011.

During a 10-minute hearing Friday, Circuit Judge David Eddy sentenced Michael Shane Bargo to death, making him the youngest of Florida's 404 death row inmates.

He was the last of five defendants to be sentenced in the April 2011 murder of Seath Jackson, 15, near Ocala.

Justice served: Michael Bargo, 21, was sentenced to death today for his part in the slaying of teenager Seath Jackson in April 2011

Stone-faced: Bargo stared blankly at the judge as he read his sentence, only blinking a few times

Emotional day: Family and friends of Michael Bargo wept in the audience after learning of his fate

Too little, too late: Bargo's father, described during the trial as an abusive alcoholic, called out to him, saying 'I love you, son,' before he was led away

The other defendants — Amber Wright, 
17; Kyle Hooper, 19; Charlie Kay Ely, 21; and Justin Soto, 22 — were all
sentenced to life in prison.

Prosecutors
say Jackson was lured to the home by his ex-girlfriend, Amber Wright, 
where he was beaten, shot and tortured before his body was burned in a 
backyard fire pit.

The 
teen's remains were then placed into three paint buckets and dumped into
a limerock pit. Testimony showed bad blood existed between Jackson and 
Bargo, who started dating Wright after her split from the 15-year-old.

Bargo was believed to be the triggerman and mastermind behind the plot to kill Jackson. On the stand, however, Bargo fingered Hooper as the gunman.

'I
reference my experience to note this is the most cold, calculated 
premeditated case of murder I have ever seen,' Judge Eddy said in court 
Friday, the Ocala Star-Banner reported.

In a recent jailhouse interview with the Star-Banner, Bargo said, ‘I'm not crazy, I'm not a psycho, I'm not a bad person.’

During the trial, Hooper described how Bargo ordered him to place Jackson in the bathtub alive so he would know who killed him.

Bargo
told jurors during his trial in August that he wasn't at the home when 
Jackson was killed and was only an accessory after the fact. The jury 
recommended the death sentence by a 10-2 vote.

During
the penalty phase of the trial the defense presented evidence of a 
messy separation between his parents that left Bargo angry and bitter.

They also suggested that Bargo suffers from seizures in his brain where he becomes unable to control his emotions.

less than three hours for his part in the 2011 murder of Seath Jackson.
A jury late yesterday decided he deserved the death sentence

The
state countered with an expert that disagrees with some of the 
defense's assessment. They said Bargo was in control of his emotions the
night Jackson was killed.

During
his sentencing, the 21-year-old sat at the defense table staring 
blankly at the judge. Upon learning his fate, Bargo merely blinked, but 
showed no emotion. 

Jackson's family wasn't in the courtroom Friday. Bargo's relatives sobbed in the courtroom upon learning the sentence. His father, Michael Bargo Sr., called out ‘I love you son,’ before he was taken away.

The average death row inmate remains incarcerated in a cell measuring 6 by 9 feet for 13 years before execution.

His defense attorney argued that Bargo didn't act alone and he was clearly mentally ill.

But prosecutors convinced the majority of the 12-person jury at Marion County Court that Bargo was the mastermind of a cold, calculated and premeditated murder and deserved the death sentence.

His mother, Tracey O'Brien, 38, tearfully testified before the verdict in August that her son had grown up with an alcoholic father with an explosive temper.

His
lawyers attempted to avoid the death penalty by arguing that Bargo, Jr 
suffered abuse at the hands of his mother and was traumatized by his 
parents' divorce.

The devastated mother was summoned to the Florida court from her home in Michigan to testify at her son's sentencing hearing.

O'Brien
reportedly did not testify at her son's murder trial because, according
to testimony from Bargo, Sr, her son didn't want her there.

She
told the court that the hearing was the first time she'd seen her son 
in four years and detailed her unhappy marriage with Bargo, Sr, who she 
described as an abusive alcoholic who regularly lashed out in anger.

'He would throw 
dinner if it wasn't warm, or I said something wrong or we got into an 
argument, he would start throwing things,' she said.

Six people were arrested in 
connection to the brutal murder of Seath Jackson and four have already been 
convicted and sentenced to life in prison.

Jackson was lured to a home in April 2011 by his ex-girlfriend Amber Wright under the pretense of rekindling their relationship.

Once Jackson arrived at the house, her new boyfriend Bargo, along with Wright, Justin Soto, Charlie K Ely and Kyle Hooper beat him, shot him multiple times, tied 
him up, broke his knees and burned his body alive, disposing of his remains in paint cans
which they threw into a quarry.
