A former anchor for WCBS-TV in New York who was forced to quit his $300,000 a year job after he was arrested for choking his wife has been arrested yet again after police say he harassed his wife and violated a protective order by calling her more than 100 times.

Rob Morrison, 46, of Stamford, Connecticut, turned himself in to Darien police on Monday after a warrant for his arrest was issued.

It's alleged that over the course of several days in May, Morrison placed over 120 calls to his wife, Ashley, at her home in Darien.

The protective order does not require that he stay away from his wife, but it does forbid him from undertaking any harassing activity.

Tempestuous relationship: Ashley and Rob Morrison seen here in 2008 in New York City are still together - despite Mr. Morrison being arrested for a second time on charges of harassment. He was accused of choking his life last year but those charges were dropped

Morrison’s wife, former CBS MoneyWatch anchor Ashley Morrison, went to police 'physically shaking' and in a 'very fragile state' on May 25 to report the alleged harassment, according to the Connecticut Post.

She told cops she feared her husband 'could kill her if she got him arrested.'

A search of Rob Morrison's cellphone records indicated that over the course of the Memorial holiday weekend, he placed 121 calls to his wife's cellphone and home phone.

Most of the calls were made on May 25 when he allegedly called 109 times and 'would hang up and call right back for approximately 14 hours,' police said.

The couple have a nine-year-old son together and they were apparently arguing over the possibility of her relocating with him.

He said he told her that it wasn't the time to talk about it, saying his son has no idea that a move is in his future.

'We have done a wonderful job of shielding him from what has transpired over the past 16-17 months,' Morrison said to the Stamford Advocate.

IN his previous case in which the charges were dropped, Morrison said that he acted badly against his wife and that his court case has been a time of 'personal growth'

He said after a few moments after the heated conversation began, he turned and saw his son standing near the stairs crying.

Morrison said his wife then cut off communications, frustrating his efforts to talk to his son.

'There
 was no response and I became concerned,' he said. 'I don't want to talk
 to Ashley. I need to know my son is OK; what he witnessed, if it 
troubled him.

We had 
long-term plans to go golfing the next day being broken. All he may be 
thinking is, `Daddy's gone and he isn't coming back.' '

Over the course of the next couple days Morrison admitted, 'I tried like hell to get in touch with her.'

For three weeks after the incident, Morrison said he and Ashley and their son have 'had some wonderful times.'

'I had no idea she went to the cops,' he said. 'I still don’t know why.'

'As
 far as I’m concerned, it was simply that she was aggravated and angry 
that I wouldn’t have that conversation and she decided to put a barrier 
between me and my son,' he said.

'I
 think that’s an abuse of a protective order that’s put in place to help
 people who are in danger or some sort of peril. It’s not meant — 
because you’re in a bad mood — to prevent a father from talking to his 
son.'

Morrison declined to comment if he and Ashley were considering staying together

Morrison
 is charged with one count of criminal violation of a protective order 
and one count of harassment in the second-degree.

He was released after posting a $50,000 bond.
