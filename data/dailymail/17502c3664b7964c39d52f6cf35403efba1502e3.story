Detailed images two American ships that sank off the coast of England during a pre-D-Day training exercise in World War II have been recorded by a U.S. submarine.

The images, recorded by a Massachusetts company that surveyed the wreckage to mark the 70th anniversary of the sinking, are the first in high definition.

The two ships were sunk off by German forces during Exercise Tiger on April 28, 1944, claiming the lives of 749 U.S. soldiers and sailors.

The company behind the images, 
Hydroid, based in Bourne, Massachusetts, said they had become interested
 in exploring the area because of the upcoming anniversary of the 
attack.

The unmanned submarine recorded images of the two boats about 50 meters beneath the surface of the English Channel.

Divers
 have accessed the site before, but the submarine provided the highest 
quality images yet, including one showing a boat's upturned stern

‘Using the AUV we could get down very close to the wreck,’ Richard Williams, regional manager for Hydroid Europe, said.

Exercise Tiger, also known as Operation Tiger remains one of the least known Allied disasters of World War II.

The ships were sunk by German tornadoes during the botched Exercise Tiger off the coast of Devon in April 1944, which took the lives of 749 U.S. soldiers

It was the code name for a series of rehearsal exercises ahead of D-Day which took place on Slapton Sands, Devon in April 1944.

An
 Allied convoy which had positioned itself to prepare for a landing of 
Slapton Beach, which was to act as a ‘fake Utah Beach’, was attacked by 
E-boats of the German Kriegsmarine,

The fast-moving torpedo boats sank two Allied ships and badly damaged a third, killing 749 U.S. servicemen.

Many of the casualties drowned while waiting to be rescued, having abandoned ships under fire.

The
 soldiers were not used to being at sea and had put on their lifebelts 
incorrectly and were pushed underwater by their combat packs.

Survivors were sworn to secrecy to ensure that the plans for D-Day remained unknown.

The casualties were not announced until nearly two months after the invasion of Normandy.

Although
 it has been accused of being a cover-up, due to the initial secrecy and
 the huge impact of D-Day that followed, Exercise Tiger was long simply 
forgotten.

Full details were
 not known until 1974, when the records were declassified as a result of
 the efforts of Ken Small, a local man who had discovered evidence of 
Exercise Tiger while beachcombing.

An annual wreath-laying to honour the victims is scheduled for Monday at U.S. Coast Guard Station Barnegat Light in New Jersey.

Hydroid will donate the images to the United Kingdom's National Archive and local memorials.
