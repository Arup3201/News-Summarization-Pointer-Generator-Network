Held: Suspected British paedophile Michael Hunter, pictured, has been arrested in America after allegedly posing as a teenager and staying with a 15-year-old boy and his mother

A suspected British paedophile has been arrested in America after posing as a teenager and staying with a 15-year-old boy and his mother.

Michael Hunter, 25, was being held in jail on suspicion of flying to Florida to carry out illegal acts with a minor.

Hunter, from Birmingham, had been staying with the teenage boy and his mother after meeting online in an internet chat room.

He is understood to have told the family he was 17 years old.

When he was arrested he told detectives he was 17 and also gave a false name.

After FBI agents began making checks it was revealed Hunter was actually aged 25.

It also emerged that he had travelled to America on a previous occasion to stay with the same family he had duped into believing he was a teen.

Hunter's alleged masquerade came to and end after the father of the teen became suspicious and alerted police.

When detectives arrived at the family home in Fruit Cove, Florida, Hunter emerged from the house carrying a suitcase.

He gave officers a false name of Gary Johnson and said he was 17 years of age.

He also gave officers conflicting stories saying he met the victim at school and had also been kicked out of his home.

The 15-year-old boy told police Hunter was 'just a friend' and said they had met in an Internet chat room. 

After local police began questioning Hunter they called in FBI agents to assist in questioning.

Hunter was being held on a charge of traveling to meet a minor for the purpose of an illegal act.

He is being held in St John County Jail on £75,000 bond.
