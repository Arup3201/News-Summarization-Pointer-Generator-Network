A group of residents furious at Christmas shoppers clogging up their street are issuing fake parking tickets to ward them off.

They have even placed mock  permits in a number of car windscreens along Victoria Park, Cambridge, and put up signs warning drivers of the 'parking restrictions'.

Motorists who park in the street illegally will be slapped with a 'ticket' which politely tells them it is against the law to park there.

Families living in the access only road in West Chesterton became so fed up with the parking war that they were given yellow 'parking permits' to hand to visitors.

But these were not sanctioned by any official parking authority.

Both the police and the county council have confirmed that no such laws are in place and said they would not be enforcing any parking law in the area.

But Simon Watkins, chairman of the local resident's association, has said 'something radical has to be done'.

He said: 'We did make the permits up ourselves and we do put polite notices on cars illegally parked.

They have even placed mock permits in a number of car windscreens along the only-access road 

'This is merely an attempt to discourage people from parking here. We did have a sign up by the green but the council said it was illegal and it was taken down.

'We do have other signs up. I think the wider issue is the lack of parking in Cambridge. Something radical has to be done.

'The council and the police are both right but it is illegal to park in an 'access only' area. It used to be enforced by the traffic wardens before the council took over and the wardens encouraged us to set up our own scheme. It worked for a few years then stopped. The police enforced it for a while and then got fed up.

One resident, who did not wish to be named, has branded the parking 'permits' a 'joke' and was unhappy that it was pulling the wool over the public's eyes. 

He said: 'I came across the permit when I moved into the house – it had been left behind by the previous owner. As soon as I saw it I thought it couldn't be serious – it seemed like a bit of a joke. 

'It's the attempt to mislead the general public that it's some form of 'official' document which bothers me as it's quite clearly a fabrication. 

'What's the point of having the permits when they're completely meaningless anyway? It seems to me that it's a minority of busybodies trying to impose their will unlawfully on the rest of the community.

'What also annoys me is the attempt to make it look pseudo-official, which means when a relative comes to stay they feel as though they can't even park near my home.' 

A spokesman for the county council, which enforces parking laws in the city, said: 'There is no council managed residents' parking permit scheme on Victoria Park. 

'This is an access only road which is enforced by the police. We and the police have met with the residents but there was no clear consensus about being part of a council run permit scheme.' 

A Cambridgeshire police spokesman said: 'If there was an official parking permit sign or restrictions in the street we would enforce them.'
