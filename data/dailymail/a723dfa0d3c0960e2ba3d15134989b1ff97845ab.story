Daniel Crespo, the California mayor shot on Tuesday, may have had multiple affairs, it has been reported. 

The Los Angeles Times reported that 'law enforcement sources [...] said they had received information that Crespo had relationships with women besides his wife.'

Los Angeles County sheriff's officials say Lyvette Crespo shot her husband - who was the mayor of Bell Gardens - several times Tuesday after he got into a physical altercation with their 19-year-old son. The 45-year-old mayor was pronounced dead at a hospital.

Lawyer Eber Bayona, who is representing Lyvette Crespo, said Thursday his client was a victim of domestic violence but he gave no details of how that might have played a role in the deadly incident.

What happened? Mayor Daniel Crespo, pictured with daughter Chrystal, allegedly told his brother William there was another woman

Bayona said Lyvette Crespo has cooperated with authorities since the outset and was released after questioning.

There has been no arrest and no criminal charges thus far.

'I think the evidence will corroborate that she has been a victim of domestic violence for many years,' Bayona said.

Sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said there were no prior calls concerning domestic violence at the home.

William Crespo, the mayor's brother, said the allegations were a lie. He said he wants his sister-in-law to be charged with second-degree murder, adding that she knows how to use a gun.

'He doesn't know what he's talking about,' he told reporters about Bayona. 'He's trying to make up ... you know, make my brother look bad, when my brother's not a bad man.'

'I don't know why she didn't call 911,' he said.

However, he told ABC7 on Friday his brother had an affair.

'He came to me crying and he said, "Willy I cheated on her,"' William Crespo told the affiliate station. 'It was wrong that he cheated on her.'

'[The other woman] wouldn't let go,' he also told ABC7. 'She kept saying she was pregnant, and then my brother, he wanted to find out if she was really pregnant. She was pregnant. She was. She's not pregnant. She lost the baby.'

A phone call from the mistress led to the Crespos' fighting, William Crespo alleged to the news station.

'I seen the phone and I seen the woman. She was at the hospital when he died,' he told the affiliate station. 'She said, "Oh I just talked to him a little while ago."'

Bayona told reporters that looks may be deceiving.

'In this case there may be an opportunity to learn about the difficult and intolerable home life for this family,' he said without providing specifics.

The Crespos were reportedly high school sweethearts who married as teenagers in 1986

Claudia Osuna, a lawyer for the Crespos' adult son and daughter, said her clients were standing by their mother. She stated that the son also was a victim of domestic violence.

A biography on the Bell Gardens website said the Crespos were high school sweethearts who married as teenagers in 1986.

Authorities believe the two were fighting when their son, Daniel, tried to intervene and got into a struggle with his father, sheriff's Deputy Crystal Hernandez said. His mother then got a gun and opened fire, Hernandez said.

Bell Gardens, a city of about 43,000, is one of a series of nondescript suburbs southeast of Los Angeles. The 2.5-square mile city is bordered by several other small towns. One is the city of Bell, which became synonymous with municipal corruption after several former officials were convicted of fleecing millions from taxpayers and padding their salaries.

Bell Gardens City Council members serve part-time and rotate the mayor's position among themselves.

Crespo, first elected to the council in 2001, was a Los Angeles County deputy probation officer.
