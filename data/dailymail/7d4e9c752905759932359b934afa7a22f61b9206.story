A manager at the prestigious New York Athletic Club allegedly demanded sexual favours from female employees in return for prime hours and weekends off, according to court papers.

It is claimed that banquet supervisor Nesim Zuberi, 45, 'had his own harem' of female employees at the Manhattan club and took photographs and videos of encounters with them to show to co-workers.

Mr Zuberi is also said to have shown pictures of his penis to colleagues and images of him and his wife involved in a sexual act with a 'Russian lady', according to the papers seen by the New York Post.

The papers claimed that he asked female staff to join him in late night orgies in exchange for plum work assignments.

Lawyer for Keisi Ballenilla, a former employee of the club who was sole plaintiff in the related 2011 lawsuit said: 'Zuberi had (and possibly still has) his own harem made up of vulnerable female club employees).'

Ballenilla made the claims in a deposition made earlier this year and seen by the Post.

She claimed that at least five employees were involved in the trysts, with one female banquet server allegedly pressured into having sex with Mr Zuberi.

The woman involved was also said to be involved in a sexual relationship with a Catholic priest at the time.

According to the deposition, Ms Ballenilla claims that she was coerced into having sex with Zuberi on a billiard table at the club.

She also alleges that in 2009, while pregnant with her daughter, Mr Zuberi still demanded sex.

But the club has fiercely denied the allegations.

NYAC spokesman James O'Brien told the Post: 'As soon as the lawsuit was filed, our outside legal counsel conducted an exhaustive investigation and concluded that the allegations were without merit.'

Mr Zuberi also strenously denied the allegations, telling the paper: 'Listen, there's no truth to any of this.'

The club's long-established reputation as a haven of classy R&R has turned it into a renowned facet of the glamorous New York City lifestyle.

In season four of Mad Men, Don Draper (played by John Hamm) is seen doing laps of the pool at the New York Athletic Club - and later smoking under the awnings and ogling women walking by.
