'Power ship': The Fatmagül Sultan is helping to keep the lights on in Lebanon

An enormous 'power ship' is helping to keep the lights on in Lebanon as the country's energy supply struggles to meet growing demand.

The Turkish-owned ship, named the Fatmagül Sultan, arrived off the coast of Beirut and was hooked up to the country's national grid earlier this year, as part of an innovative project aimed at tackling power shortages in developing countries.

With its 11 towering chimneys, the floating power station is credited with providing an extra two hours of electricity per day to Lebanon, where an influx of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees over the past two years has put the energy supply under further strain.

The ship is moored off Beirut under a
$370m deal between the Lebanese government and Turkish energy firm 
Karadeniz Holding, according to a report in the Guardian.

It
is to be followed by a second Turkish power ship set to arrive off 
Beirut in June, which will see the extra 188MW of electricity per day 
already provided by the Fatmagül Sultan boosted to 270MW daily.

'The
arrival of the ships will ease the summer brunt when the power demand 
will reach 3,000MW,' said Kamal Hayek, general manager of Électricité du Liban.

Lebanon's
energy minister Gebran Bassil has said the country's energy demand was 
increasing by an average of between six and eight per cent annually, but
the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees had seen it 
rocket over the past two years.

'The power ships do not represent an ultimate solution to the electricity problem but a three-year temporary solution to allow the rehabilitation of [existing, conventional] power plants at Jiyeh and Zouk,' he said.

Karedeniz Holding operates a fleet of seven ships and is in the process of building five more due to interest from developing countries dealing with unreliable power supplies.

New projects are thought to be in the pipeline for Libya and some African countries.

Osman Karadeniz, president of the firm, has said the inspiration behind his power ships scheme was witnessing the impact of poor electricity supply to hospitals in west Africa.
