A bride stunned shoppers by visiting a supermarket in her wedding dress to stock up on booze.

Anna Savery had no time to dress down when she called in at Asda after tying the knot with husband James - because there wasn’t long before the store was due to close.

She said she felt no inhibitions because she had previously visited the store in her pyjamas.

Walking down the aisles: Bride Anna Savery stunned shoppers in Cwmbran, south Wales, when she went on a last-minute dash for alcohol in Asda. She had no time to change - because the shop was about to shut

Mrs Savery, 39, and her 26-year-old husband had tied the knot at Pontypool Register Office, South Wales, and had their ‘wedding breakfast’ at a carvery restaurant.

To keep the cost down, the couple decided to have the evening party at Mrs Savery’s mother’s house.

The new bride, who dashed around the supermarket in Cwmbran, Torfaen, to buy alcohol with her new mother-in-law and sister-in-law, was overwhelmed by the reactions of staff and customers.

‘People were smiling and asking for photos. It was surreal,’ said Mrs Savery, a mother of three.

‘I felt like a celebrity. I had people saying I looked beautiful and one man said his daughter said I looked like a princess.’

The visit to Asda was a ‘very impromptu idea’, she admitted.

Something cold, something brewed: Mrs Savery needed the alcohol for a reception that night at her mother's house, and said she was unruffled at her surprise appearance because she once visited the store in pyjamas

‘I decided to go to Asda, but it was shutting in 45 minutes so I didn’t have time to go and change.

‘But I have been in my pyjamas before, why not in my wedding dress?’

Mrs Savery was congratulated by Cwmbran blogger Ben Black who filmed her out shopping and put the video online.

Alongside the video, he wrote: ‘I’m smiling and have goose bumps as I type this blog.

‘To Anna and James - have a fantastic night and wonderful future together. You put a grin on a lot of people’s faces tonight.’

Mrs Savery’s choice of shopping attire may have raised no eyebrows at Asda but a nearby Tesco store has previously banned customers from shopping in their pyjamas.

Notices were put up in Tesco’s St Mellons branch in Cardiff in 2010 saying: ‘Footwear must be worn at all times and no nightwear is permitted.’

One customer, Elaine Carmody, a full-time mother of two, was refused service for wearing pyjamas. She described the ban as ‘ridiculous and pathetic’.

She said she had been ‘popping in for a pack of fags’ but ‘would have gone in clothed’ for a full shop.

‘If you’re allowed to wear jogging bottoms, why aren’t you allowed to wear pyjamas in there? That’s what I don’t understand,’ she said.

A Tesco spokesman said the company did not have a strict dress code but it did not want people shopping in their nightwear in case it offended other customers.
