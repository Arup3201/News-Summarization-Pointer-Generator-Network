Elliot Rodger was beaten up, left with a broken ankle and robbed of his Gucci sunglasses after he tried to push girls off a ledge for not talking to him at a party, his manifesto has revealed.

The 141-page document, which the 22-year-old virgin emailed to his parents and friends before he killed six people on Friday, gives terrifying insight into Rodger's hatred towards women for failing to pay him attention.

In one excerpt from last year, he wrote about heading out to party in Isla Vista just days before his 22nd birthday in one 'last ditch effort' to lose his virginity.

'That was the only thing that could have saved me,' he wrote in the memoir. 'I was giving the female gender one last chance to provide me with the pleasures I deserved from them.'

Lonely: Gunman Elliot Rodger described how he had only one friend, who had provided the only light in his life

He described how he bought a bottle of vodka and drank a few shots before heading out so that he could get some courage to enter the party - although he admitted he drank a little too much.

At the party, he quickly became irritated that no one was talking to him, especially girls who were chatting with 'obnoxious slobs' instead, he wrote.

So he went outside - but there he saw guys walking with 'hot blonde girls on their arm', which 'fueled me with rage', he said, explaining that he felt that these girls should have been giving him attention.

He climbed onto a ledge and - after miming as if he was shooting them - some of the crowd joined him, including 'rowdy boys whom I've always despised' and some girls. While up there, he became annoyed that none of the girls were talking to him, so he began insulting them, he said.

'A dark, hate-fueled rage overcame my entire being, and I tried to push as many of them as I could from the 10-foot ledge,' he wrote. 'My main target was the girls. I wanted to punish them for talking to the obnoxious boys instead of me.'

But the group fought back and eventually, he was pushed to the ground. When he fell, he heard a 'snap' in his ankle, breaking it, he said.

As he limped away, he realized that his Gucci sunglasses were missing and went to get them back, but was so drunk, he couldn't remember where the party was.

Instead, 
he went to a nearby house and demanded to know where his glasses were. A
 group of 'brutes' started calling him names before dragging him out to 
the driveway and hitting him, he said.

'I had never been beaten and humiliated that badly,' he said. 'Everyone in Isla Vista saw what happened, and it was truly horrific.

'The worst part of this whole ordeal was... the fact that no one showed any concern... If girls had been attracted to me, they would have offered to walk me to my room and take care of me. They would have even offered to sleep with me to make me feel better.'

The next morning, he awoke to pain and 
his father took him to the hospital, where police interviewed him. 
Fearful that he could get in trouble, he told them he had acted 'cocky' 
towards a group of boys, so they had pushed him from the ledge. The 
police didn't pursue any charges, he said.

As he recovered from his broken ankle, Rodger's self pity grew and he focused on his 'Day of Retribution,' deciding to enact his 'revenge' in the spring of 2014.

On Friday, Rodger, the son of Hunger Games assistant director Peter Rodger, acted upon his threats, killing six people before shooting himself dead.

Weihan Wang, 20, of Fremont, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose, were both stabbed to death by Rodger on Friday at the apartment they had shared with him. Investigators are looking into whether he killed the pair in their sleep.

The body of another UCSB student, George Chen, 19, of San Jose, was also found at the apartment, but he did not live there.

 then climbed into his SUV and drove towards the Alpha Phi sorority 
house, where he shot dead Katherine Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19.

He
 then got back into his car and drove to a nearby deli, where he opened 
fire. There, he killed student Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, in an attack 
that was captured on surveillance footage.Â

The gunman then climbed back into his car and continued to shoot at passersby as he drove, hitting three pedestrians before he police officers returned fire and shot him in the hip.

He tried to escape and knocked down a cyclist, before he eventually shot himself in the head and smashed into parked cars.

When police found his body, he was surrounded by three semi-automatic handguns and nearly 400 rounds of ammunition, which had all been purchased legally.
