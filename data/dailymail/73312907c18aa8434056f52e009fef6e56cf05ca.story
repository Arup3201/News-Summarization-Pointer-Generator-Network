These dramatic pictures show the heavy flooding in France that has claimed its first victim - and forced the closure of the Roman Catholic pilgrimage site at Lourdes today.

Frothy water 5ft deep was swirling around the Lourdes grotto, a hillside site where the Virgin Mary was said to have appeared to a peasant girl in 1858 and Catholicism's most-visited miracle shrine.

Authorities evacuated several hundred pilgrims from hotels and camping sites after melting snow and summer storms caused the Gave de Pau river in south-west France to burst its banks yesterday.

It comes less than a year after flash floods caused millions of pounds worth of damage to the shrine.

A 70-year-old woman died last night while trying to get out of her flood-trapped car in the town of Pierrefitte-Nestalas, the regional prosecutor's office said. Water levels were slowly receding today.

Interior Minister Manuel Valls visited the area, located in the foothills of the Pyrenees. He said: ‘We need more reinforcements in the area to face these floods, which are really exceptional.’

Mr Valls added that days of sustained rains and sudden snowmelt had made the flooding worse.

Rescue services were particularly concerned with bringing weak and sick pilgrims to safety. A group of 3,000 children due for a day visit had their trip cancelled.

'These floods are really exceptional'

Interior Minister Manuel Valls

Some 6million pilgrims visit Lourdes annually, many to bathe in the grotto's normally tranquil spring waters and pray for healing at its altar -  damaged by flash floods in October last year.

The website for the pilgrimage complex, which includes several buildings and a sanctuary nestled beneath a rocky hillside, carried a dramatic rundown of the rising waters.

As the waters began to rise, masses were cancelled. One by one, entrances to the sanctuary were cordoned off. The live video feed of the grotto went down. Then the electricity and phones were cut.

‘A vision of the apocalypse in the Sainte Bernadette Church, where the big movable partition is threatening to fall,’ read one announcement. ‘The water has risen above the stairs of the choir.’
