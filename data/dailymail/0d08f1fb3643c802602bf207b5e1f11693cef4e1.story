Robin van Persie has paid tribute to Dirk Kuyt after the versatile former Liverpool forward retired from international football.

The Manchester United striker posted  pictures of Kuyt on Instagram and Facebook with the caption: 'Thank you my friend!! 104 caps and 24 goals for Holland. Legend of the game! @11dirkkuyt'.

Kuyt decided to retire from international duty on Friday after a 10-year career with Holland that saw the Fenerbahce attacker play at three World Cups and two European Championships.

Born: Holland, July 22 1980 (age 34)

1998-2003: Utrecht (160 apps, 51 goals)

2003-2006: Feyenoord (101, 71)

2006-2012: Liverpool (285, 71)

2012-NOW: Fenerbahce (64, 18) 

The utility man earned 104 caps and 24 goals, but admitted warming the bench under new manager Guus Hiddink was a factor in his decision.

The 34-year-old, in a statement posted on the Dutch FA website, said: 'I can't see myself putting a lot of effort into Oranje and not playing much.

'I can look back with enormous pride on 10 wonderful years in the Netherlands team.'

Kuyt was first called up to the Holland squad in September 2004 during his time with Dutch club Feyenoord and the forward made his international debut against Lichtenstein.

A utility player, Kuyt found himself playing in defence, midfield and attack during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, where new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal led Holland to the semi finals.

Kuyt scored 71 goals in 285 Premier League appearances for Liverpool before joining current club Fenerbahce in the Turkish Super Lig in 2012.
