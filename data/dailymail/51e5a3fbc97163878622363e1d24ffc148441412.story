Pressure is mounting on the boss of Lloyds to give up his bonus after the bank was rocked by yet another fine relating to a mis-selling scandal.

The Financial Services Authority yesterday fined the taxpayer-backed lender £4.3m for delays in paying out compensation to 140,000 customers missold payment protection insurance.

It is another humiliation for the bank which, analysts believe, could see its PPI bill jump from the £5.3bn already set aside to £6.3bn.

Under pressure: Antonio Horta-Osorio, CEO of Lloyds bank, is facing calls to give up his bonus

The Financial Services Authority described how inexperienced staff made errors and lost vital paperwork relating to mis-sold payment protection insurance.

This resulted in delays for up to 140,000 customers, with 8,800 forced to wait more than six months for average payouts of £2,733.

Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime at the FSA, said Lloyds ‘fell well short of the standard the FSA expects’.

Treasury Select Committee member John Mann said Mr Horta-Osorio should not be getting a bonus

Richard Lloyd, director of consumer 
group Which?, said: ‘Banks must help consumers claim back the 
compensation they are rightly due without hassle.’

Lloyds insisted all affected customers  had received their compensation, plus 8 per cent interest.
A spokesman said: ‘We apologise to those whose payments were delayed'.

Lloyds chief executive Antonio 
Horta-Osorio immediately came under pressure to waive his bonus for 
2012, which could be as big as £5.3m on top of his £1.1m salary.

He is also due to be paid 1.7m shares 
in June this year, worth around £940,000 at last night’s closing price 
of 55.26p, as part of the deal to hire him from rival Santander in early
2011.

Labour MP John Mann, a member of the influential Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘He should not be getting a bonus. This is a taxpayer-owned bank that he is running and has a poor performance. He should be paying money back not taking money out. This is a reward for incompetence and failure.’

Mark Fisher, the former Royal Bank of Scotland banker hired by Lloyds to integrate HBOS following the disastrous takeover during the financial crisis, also faces pressure to give up his bonus as he is overseeing the clean-up of the PPI scandal.

Lloyds, which is yet to reveal how much its senior staff will get in bonuses, is set to post another set of huge losses when it announces annual results for 2012 on March 1.

Referring to its bonus pay-outs, one insider at the bank said: ‘I don’t think anyone is expecting anywhere near the maximum.’

RBS chief executive Stephen Hester and
Barclays boss Antony Jenkins have both waived their bonuses for 2012 
after a year of shame for the industry – piling pressure on Horta-Osorio
to do the same.

Horta-Osorio
has been credited with coming clean over the scale of the PPI problem 
at Lloyds after he joined the bank. But the FSA report yesterday showed 
how the vast clean-up operation has been beset by mistakes.
