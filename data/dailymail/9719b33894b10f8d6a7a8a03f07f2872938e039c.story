An elderly couple who were married for 68 years were holding hands when they were found in a fatal car wreckage this weekend, state troopers have said.

Great-grandparents Floyd Nordhagen, 92, and Margaret Nordhagen, 88, died on Sunday after their car attempted to make a turn and smashed into an oncoming truck near Spokane, Washington.

When state patrol troopers responded to the crash scene, they found Mrs Nordhagen gripping her husband's hand.

'You don’t see that every day,' Trooper Rob Spencer told KREM. 'We actually had to ask her to let go of him, so we could get him out of the car.'

Loss: Floyd Nordhagen, 92, and Margaret Nordhagen, 88, were holding hands in a car wreckage when troopers arrived on the scene on Sunday. The couple both died from their injuries

In love: Friends said it was right that the couple, who had been married for 68 years, died together as they had done everything together in life. Floyd often boasted about how pretty his wife was, they said

The couple both passed away at the scene. The two passengers in the pick-up truck were not injured, although a dog was thrown from the vehicle in the impact and he was found to be unharmed.

Friends and family said that although the deaths were tragic, they were relieved to know that the couple, who were from Chattaroy, had died together - as this is how they had lived their lives.

A friend of the Nordhagens, Britches Peden, said: 'I don't know if they were holding hands before he passed, or if she grabbed him afterward but it doesn’t matter.

'They would have been holding hands if they could. so that's the way we all want to remember them.'

Friends added that Mr Nordhagen, who owned a farm and ranch land and reared cattle, always bragged about how pretty his wife was, and told them he made sure to kiss and hug her every day.

Scene: The couple turned into an oncoming pick-up truck on Newport Highway, Washington on Sunday

And the love was returned; when Mr Nordhagen struggled to push the lawnmower, friends watched as his wife joined him so that they could push it together.

Peden added that he believed that his friend misjudged the speed of the oncoming car when he tried to turn on the highway.

'We all make mistakes, but evidently that was a fatal one and I'm sure sorry to hear it,' he said.

The couple, who celebrated their 68-year anniversary in July, are survived by their four children, 11 grandchildren and 23 great-grandchildren.
