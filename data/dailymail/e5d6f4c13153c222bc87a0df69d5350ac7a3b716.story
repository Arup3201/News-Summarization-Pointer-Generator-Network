The percentage of American men who work or are actively searching for work is at an historic low.

Men between the ages of 25 and 54 now participate in the workforce at only around 88 percent.  In 1956, 98 percent of American men were active in the workforce.

Due to a changing job marketplace, the Great Recession, male imprisonment and other factors, a fewer percentage of men are now working than ever before.

Vanishing act: Men aged 25 to 54 who participate in the American workforce are at an all-time low according to Bureau of Labor Statistic data

Among the less educated, reports CNN, men have been increasingly left behind as employment opportunities require more skill or a level of education beyond a high school degree.

Pair that with a widening dearth of well-paid manufacturing jobs and men with lower education levels are at an even greater disadvantage.

College educated men are also vanishing from the workplace. Analysts report that men 25 and up with a bachelor’s degree participated in the workforce at 80.2 percent in May 2012, an over 7 percent drop from ten years ago.

Even in boom years, like those that 
preceded the Great Recession, men’s participation rate continued to fall
despite unemployment reaching a 30-year low in the early 2000s.

Going down: Men 25 to 54 now account for less of the American workforce than ever before. Male participation rates have dropped steadily for decades, and the descent quickened with the onset of the Great Recession

Changing places: Men with lower levels of education are increasingly choosing not to work at all instead of taking labor jobs that once paid much more. Meanwhile, women continue to make up more and more of America's workforce

The rate of workforce participation in America--that is, those who are working or searching for work--has decreased for men aged 25-54 for decades for several reasons.

Education: Fewer jobs exist for those with only a high school education and many men who could once hold well-paid manufacturing jobs, for example, now choose not to work at all instead of taking less desirable, and lower paid, blue collar work that still exists

Imprisonment: Incarceration rates have increased exponentially in recent decades. 1 in every 100 Americans are now in prison, over 90% of whom are male.

Disability: With the Great Recession came a large influx of application for disability benefits and few of those who subsequently received them have since weened themselves off

And the Great Recession itself exacerbated the problem. As the crisis grew, men’s workforce participation dipped below 90 percent for the very first time.

And it has continued to drop since, despite an improving economy.

Another factor is the number of men behind bars. An astonishing 1 out of every 100 Americans are imprisoned and over 90 percent of inmates are men. And, perhaps even more than lack of education, a criminal record can make finding a job in the afterlife of incarceration challenging.

Challenging enough, perhaps, to make men just stop trying. Which is another growing group of non-participators.

Workforce participation accounts for employed people as well as those seeking employment. It does not, of course, account for those who’ve stopped trying to find work altogether, such as those collecting unemployment or other benefits.

‘The proportion of guys doing nothing has risen,’ Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CNN.

After unemployment rates rocketed as a result of the recession, many men began to rely on unemployment benefits.

They also, increasingly, began relying on the federal disability system.

CNN
reports that 1.9 percent of working age men received disability 
benefits in 1982. In 2012, that number had reached 3.1 percent.

And only 2.2 percent of those enrolled quit the program by the start of 2013.

There
are still jobs out there, of course, even in a harsh economic climate. 
So who’s taking them in the absence of male applicants aged 25 to 54?

Economic woes: With the Great Recession came a great deal of lay-offs and though numbers have bounced back somewhat, the male workforce participation rate hit 90 percent for the first time and has continued to drop ever since

Women, according to MIT economics professor David Autor.

Female college enrollment rates have helped boost their ability to gain employment in sectors that are growing, ones that require higher education degrees.

According to Autor’s research, women born in 1975 were roughly 17% more likely than their male counterparts to attend college and nearly 23% more likely to complete a four-year degree

‘Women's persistence and enrollment rates have given them a real edge over men,’ said Burtless.
