Most people don't think twice about taking price tags off of presents before wrapping them.

But for 19-year-old Jade Marshall, doing so would be absolutely terrifying because of a rare phobia: she was frightened of stickers.

Miss Marshall, from Brighton, first realised she had a fear of stickers when she was seven at a sleepover.

Jade Marshall, 19, suffered a phobia of stickers which meant she was terrified of shopping because of the price labels on clothes, shoes and other goods

After seeing a hypnotherapist, Miss Marshall was able to overcome her phobia and can now handle stickers. This year, she will finally be able to wrap and unwrap Christmas presents

Since then, her discomfort developed into a full-blown phobia, which left her too scared to go shopping due to price stickers.

It affected her work as a nursery worker because often children would bring in strips of stickers or sticker books to play with. 

Eventually, she went to see a hypnotherapist, who coined the term 'pittakionophobia' for her rare condition.

He explained that like most phobias, pittakionophobia is an anxiety disorder rooted in a bad experience with stickers in childhood.

Miss Marshall was delighted when after a month, her phobia was cured and this year, she is able to take the stickers off her Christmas presents ready to wrap them for the first time ever.

The nursery worker said: 'I knew it was ridiculous because stickers can't hurt you or anything, I just couldn't help it.

'It was affecting every aspect of my life and really getting me down.

'Now I don't have to be scared to go shopping and I'm a lot more comfortable in my work place.'

Miss Marshall says her fear started at aged seven at a sleepover where one end of a friend's bed was covered in stickers.

She said: 'This girl had stickers from school all over one end of her bed on the bed stand.

'We were meant to be top and tailing but I didn't want to sleep near the stickers - I don't know why they just seemed weird.

Peter Field, the therapist who treated Miss Marshall says the actual causes of pittakionophobia almost always lie in the individual's past.

He said: 'Because of some past experience, the individual's subconscious mind has linked the sight or thought of stickers or sticky labels with danger and anxiety.

'Most often, this has happened in childhood or in the early years of adolescence, though in some cases it may have occurred later in life.

'Such an experience may have happened directly, as a result of a traumatic experience involving a sticker - having one stuck to some part of the body, for example - or indirectly because of another person's negative experience that was witnessed by the person who would then develop the phobia.'

'You know what kids can be like and the more I asked the more she said no.

'In the end I asked her parents to take me home, but they couldn't because they'd had a drink.

'I had to sleep on the floor. I just remember lying there thinking about the morning when I'd finally be able to go home.'

Her fear began to get worse and affect her job: she could not even be around children at the nursery wearing stickers.

Miss Marshall said: 'I was okay with brand new packs, sticky tape and post it notes, but nothing other than that.

'It was especially bad if the sticker was dirty or had started peeling off.

'It made going shopping a nightmare because I would be scared of size stickers on clothes or price stickers on shoes.'

A phobia of stickers is so rare that only one expert has given it a name - pittakionophobia.

Peter Field, a hypnotherapist based in Birmingham, felt so sorry for Miss Marshall he offered to cure her phobia.

Now she is finally able to take the price stickers off her Christmas presents for the first time ever.

Miss Marshall said: 'I think everyone would have treatment for their phobia if they could.

'At first my family didn't believe me and would try and come near me with stickers, but once they saw my reaction they were very understanding.

'I no longer have to worry it will affect me when I'm out with friends who don't know about it and I can get on with my job without feeling uncomfortable.'

The hypnotherapist who treated Miss Marshall coined a new name for her rare phobia: pittakionophobia. He says there are countless people who suffer from the fear of stickers who do not know treatment is available

Peter Field, who claims he is the first and only hypnotherapist in the country to treat this phobia, said: 'I was happy to play my part in freeing her from her life-long phobia.

'Very few therapists have even heard of this condition - which is why I created the term 'pittakionophobia', let alone know how to effectively treat it.

'There are countless people who suffer unnecessarily from the fear of stickers and simply do not know that effective treatment is available.

'I have successfully treated people with all kind of phobias, from fear of velvet to fear of clowns, fear of worms to fear of the wind, as well as the better know ones such as fear of spiders, heights, claustrophobia and so on.

'I believe that every phobia can be effectively treated and the phobic person freed from a lifetime of unnecessary anxiety and fear, provided the therapist truly understands how to do this.

'The real problem is that most of those suffering from the fear of stickers simply do not know that effective treatment is available.'

Ms Emma Citron, consultant clinical psychologist with a specialty in phobias, said cognitive behavioural therapy can be succesfully be used to treat phobias such as Miss Marshall's.

She told MailOnline: 'Anything can become a phobia. Buttons, is a common one. People get uncomfortable if there are buttons in a room, even if they are in a pot.

'Most people have an innate phobia of snakes, but all other phobias are not rational.

'They could have a phobia of rats, mice, spiders - or even collars on shirts.

'We might be able to understand phobias of snakes, spiders and mice, more easily. We might rationalise it’s because they carry disease.

'But they are not rational, they are no more rational than the phobia of collars because rats don’t have bubonic plague anymore and spiders in the UK are unlikely to harm a person.

Clinical psychologist and phobia expert Ms Emma Citron says all phobias are irrational and normally stem from a traumatic event in childhood. Pictured is a spider, which is a common phobia for many people

'About a third of people can remember a traumatic event which is the source of their phobia. But the rest don’t have such a memory – and it could be there was no traumatic event.

'It’s known that phobias are made worse by avoiding them. If you are scared of the tube and you avoid the tube, you may develop a phobia. If you force yourself to travel by tube, you won’t.

'The usual treatment is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) administered by a professional. You can be referred by your GP.

'That’s the only treatment that works. You help people change their thoughts.

'Then you might expose them to different ‘grades’ of whatever they are scared of, under psychological supervision. The person themselves sets the hierarchy, so they can cope. And they are taught coping mechanisms such as relaxation techniques.

'Some accredited psychologists might use hypnotherapy, but this would not normally be used in isolation, it would be used with CBT.'
