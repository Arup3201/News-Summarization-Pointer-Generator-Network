Manny Pacquiao once again called out Floyd Mayweather as the WBO welterweight champion received a hero's welcome during his victory parade in Manila on Thursday.

The Filipino star was greeted by thousands of fans as they lined the streets in the Makati City district of the capital to celebrate Pacquiao's dominant points win against Chris Algieri in Macau last Saturday.

Supporters braved the wet weather to catch a glimpse of their boxing hero as he was paraded through the city. Pacquiao waved and greeted the adoring fans as they turned out in droves to honour their favourite son.

The 35-year-old echoed his post-fight call for pound-for-pound king Mayweather to put his undefeated record on the line and fight him after the American took to Instagram on Tuesday to taunt Pacquiao.

Mayweather uploaded a video of Pacquiao being knocked down and then out by Juan Manuel Marquez when the pair fought back in 2012. The post was seen as suggestion from the American that Pacquiao is easy to knock out. 

'He should step up and fight me since I am easy to knock out,' Pacquiao said when asked about the video.

'The fans deserve that fight. I think it's time to step up and say yes.'
