Controversial comedian Frankie Boyle has renewed his long-running feud with Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington.

He posted on Twitter: 'I worry that Rebecca Adlington will have an unfair advantage in the swimming by possessing a dolphin's face.'

Adlington, a double gold medal winner at last year's Beijing Olympics, complained to the BBC that it let the comic off with a 'slap on the wrist' after he made comments that 'humiliated' her.

Scottish comedian Boyle posted on Twitter that Adlington would have an advantage at the Olympics because 'she has a face like a dolphin'

During an episode of the satirical Mock 
the Week show, he said she resembled 'someone looking at themselves in 
the back of a spoon'.

His comments drew 75 complaints, but the BBCÂ  Trust took no further action, despite criticising him.

Boyle refused to apologise, said the BBC Trust ruling was worthless and compared Adlington to a beagle.

Last night, Adlington ignored his post, but one Twitter user, Peter Steele, wrote: 'She will be requesting you to apologise for this comment...she tried it before, she'll try again.'

The Tweet was removed from Boyle's profile, though he did continue to post jokes about the Olympics.

Adlington, who won two gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, is again hoping for glory in the 400m and 800m freestyle events, as well as the 4x200m freestyle relay.

Today, Adlington, 23, urged the British team to seize their 'one shot' at competing in an Olympics with home advantage.

She said: 'It is going to be so different and something that you can't fully prepare for. It's exciting and new and just one of those things that you have to take in your stride.

'I know it sounds like a song, but this is our one shot to compete at a home Olympics. I just think it's going to be amazing.'
