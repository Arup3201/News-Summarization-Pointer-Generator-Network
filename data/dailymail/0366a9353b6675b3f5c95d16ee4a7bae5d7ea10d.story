Talk about taking winter sports to the next level.

Hundreds of daredevil snow kite boarders, and their brightly-coloured array of kites, recently descended on Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia, for the World Snow Kiting Championships.

The extreme athletes lit up the cloudy sky as they carved their way through the snow, making for a highly unusual, but stunning winter sight.

The brightly swirling foil kites lit up the cloudy winter sky as the extreme athletes created a stunning visual display against the stark snow

The sport sees the boarders perform stunts and tricks by utilising the strong winter winds to help them glide along snow or ice.

This year, the competition was held on the frozen waters of the Obskoye Water Reserve, where Russian photographer, Ilnar Salakhiev, 40, managed to capture the riders in action as their bold foil kites garnered dangerously high speeds.

Participant Andrew Muse, a 26-year-old extreme sports enthusiast from Utah, was on hand on for the spectacular visual display.

'The ability to go up hills or mountains and snowboard down or just legitimately fly off them is the most amazing feeling,' he said.

'I have had an incredible amount of adventures and small world experiences,' he continued. 'I'm 26 and doing my best to live the happiest, most adventurous life possible.'

And competing in such an extreme activity is just one such way that Muse ensures he lives life to the fullest.

He first began snow kiting in 2011 when, rather than driving or catching the bus, Muse decided to hitchhike his way to the canyons in his native Utah.

Among the participants was 26-year-old Andrew Muse, an extreme sports enthusiast, from Utah in the United States

For Muse, his introduction to the sport began in his home state, back in 2011, when he asked to hitchhike a ride to a local mountain

The daredevil athlete wound up meeting a surfer from Maui who introduced him to the weird and wonderful world of snow kite boarding

Muse describes the feeling of being able to go up mountains and legitimately 'fly' off of them as 'the most amazing feeling'

'I was just looking for an adventure when this kid from Maui picked me up as he was headed to the same mountain.

'We ended up riding together for the day. Later in the afternoon, he asked if I wanted to try kiteboarding.'

Though Muse had only seen the sport on the internet, he thought it just might be something that he would love.

'From that day on, I knew it was something I was going to pursue with a passion.' 

Andrew's passion for the mountains has not only fueled his love for the extreme sport, but also has helped repair family ties.

After taking a ski patrol course the following summer, Muse took his mother, a former drug addict and alcoholic, rock climbing.

'This showed her that she could experience happiness without being high,' he explained. 'She got sober and I went to New Hampshire to ski patrol.'

Ever since 2011, Muse has been pursuing snowkiting with a passion, even going so far as to become qualified in ski patrol

Among some of the stranger sights captured by Russian photographer, Ilnar Salakhiev, was a snow kite boarder in full bear costume

While Muse - and the other competitors - love the rush associated with snowkiting, they do admit that the sport can be dangerous

Snow kites aren't designed for heights of more than about 300 feet, so competitors must remain be aware of how high they 'fly' into the air

At high altitudes, there is always a possibility that the kites may fail - but Muse still doesn't regret any part of his snowkiting journey

After seeing his family life turn around, Andrew's focus is now on his snowkiting career fueled by an overriding ambition to compete professionally.

'The last snowkiting trip I went on has to be the most dangerous thing I've ever done,' he recalled.

'At some points, I was over 300 feet off the ground and kites aren't really designed for that kind of height, so if one part of the system failed I could have died.'

Still, he doesn't regret a moment. 

'It's what I love. I'd really like to compete and take my snowkiting career to the next level,' he added.

'It's just a matter of getting to a competition and having the funding to do so.'
