The integrity of the World Cup was called into question on Tuesday night after Cameroon’s football federation launched a match-fixing investigation into their own players.  

Prompted by allegations that a convicted fraudster had correctly predicted that Cameroon would lose 4-0 and have a man sent off in their group match against Croatia, the national governing body (FECAFOOT) issued an explosive statement on Tuesday confirming that their ethics committee would probe claims of fraud by ‘seven bad apples’ in their squad.

VIDEO Cameroon to investigate match-fixing claims

The African team lost all three of their 
Group A matches but the main focus is on the controversial defeat by 
Croatia in Manaus.

German magazine Der Spiegel claims to have had a 
Facebook conversation with convicted Singaporean match-fixer turned 
supergrass Wilson Raj Perumal hours before kick-off.

Perumal claimed he had not predicted the result of the match before it began.

Perumal
 said: ‘At no time did I make reference to four goals being scored or to
 a red card being issued. At no time did I suggest that I had any way of
 corroborating or substantiating what was meant to be an educated guess 
based on my extensive match-fixing experience.

‘I am shocked and 
amazed that a respected magazine such as Der Spiegel would go so far as 
to fabricate statements by yours truly with the visible aim of stirring 
the row over match-fixing.’

But Der Spiegel stood by their
 story that led to Cameroon football chief Joseph Owona, president of 
FECAFOOT’S normalisation committee, instructing their ethics committee 
to investigate.

Perumal is a convicted match-fixer from Singapore with offences including forgery, assault and burglary on his record. He was jailed in his home country for match-fixing in 1995 and claims to have tried to fix British games that year. He later ran his empire from a one-bedroom flat in the shadow of Wembley stadium, rigging hundreds of matches around the world and making millions of dollars in the process. In February 2011 he was arrested in Finland and sentenced to two years in prison.

WHERE IS HE NOW?

After serving a year in a Finnish jail, he was released and turned over to authorities in Hungary, where he was wanted on further match-fixing charges. He is currently being held in jail in Debrecen.

WHO DID HE TELL?

German journalist Rafael Buschmann wrote, in an article for Der Spiegel, that he communicated with Perumal via a Facebook message. The fixer later said he made the comments after Cameroon’s match against Croatia, but the German magazine say they stand by their story.

AND WHY IS THIS A BIG DEAL?

A 2014 report put together by more than 70 international experts over two years estimates that around $140billion is laundered through illegal sports betting.

Accused: Singaporean Wilson Raj Perumal  is alleged to have predicted Cameroon's 4-0 defeat

He said: ‘Recent allegations of fraud around 
Cameroon’s three preliminary games, especially Cameroon v Croatia, as 
well of the “existence of seven bad apples” do not reflect the values 
and principles promoted by our administration, in line with FIFA Code of
 Conduct and the ethics of our nation.

‘We wish to inform the general
 public that, though not yet  contacted by FIFA in regards to this 
affair, our administration  has already instructed its ethics committee 
to further investigate these accusations.

‘We are strongly committed 
to employ all means necessary to resolve this disruptive matter without 
delay. In the meantime we legitimately request that any related 
information, unless brought before our federation and/or its ethics 
committee, be held for or treated as mere assumption.

‘We wish to 
state that in 55 years of existence, FECAFOOT has never been sanctioned 
for, involved in, or even linked to match-fixing or any fraud of any 
kind.’

FIFA president Sepp Blatter confirmed that he was aware of 
the allegations on Tuesday, but the world governing body issued little 
more than a holding statement.

‘We are not in a position to say 
whether there are any investigations into the allegations, in order not 
to jeopardise any future investigation,’ said a spokeswoman.

But 
Chris Eaton, the Australian who has worked in sport integrity at FIFA 
and Interpol and is now the sports integrity director at the 
International Centre for Sport Security, suggested these are serious 
allegations if Der Spiegel journalist Rafael Buschmann did receive the 
correct prediction from Perumal before the game on June 18.

It was an extraordinary tournament for Cameroon.

The
 squad initially refused to board their flight to Brazil over a pay 
dispute. And as well as Alex Song’s first-half dismissal for elbowing 
Mario Mandzukic, the Croatia game was memorable for Benoit Assou-Ekotto 
seemingly trying to head-butt team-mate Benjamin Moukandjo.

It raises the question of whether the Tottenham full back lost his temper because he suspected something to be wrong.

FECAFOOT
 had already launched an investigation into that incident but what makes
 this controversy more uncomfortable for FIFA is that hosts Brazil were 
in Cameroon’s group.

FIFA’s security department is also believed to be looking into the claims. 

In
 his conversation with Der Spiegel, Perumal is alleged to have written: 
‘In this team there are seven bad apples.’

Perumal, currently being held
 in Hungary and fighting extradition proceedings to face a five-year 
prison sentence in his native Singapore, told the magazine he believes 
Cameroon manipulated all three group games.

Last week FIFA security 
director Ralf Mutschke said there had been no suspicious betting 
patterns for any match at the tournament. But Eaton believes it would be
 wrong to dismiss the story and that FIFA should instead determine, 
beyond doubt, Perumal did communicate his accurate prediction before the
 game.

At the same time he would also question how Perumal was 
allowed to communicate with journalists when he could be motivated by 
revenge against those who shopped him to the authorities in Finland two 
months ago and when he is in prison in Debrecen.

Eaton said: ‘If it 
is confirmed that the advice from Perumal was made before the match and 
is accurate to the overall result and red card, then this allegation 
will no doubt be treated extremely seriously by football, governments 
and beyond. 

‘I understand that he has made other predictions during this  competition that have not proved accurate.

‘The
 advice we have received from the legal or so-called regulated sport 
betting industry is that there was “no observable suspicious betting on 
this match”.

‘But the Cameroon match-fixing case is a grave 
allegation with an alleged and strong indication of pre-match knowledge 
from a well-known match-fixer.’
