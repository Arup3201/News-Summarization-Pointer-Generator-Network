A bitter row has erupted over the planned tomb of Richard III after a historical society announced it is withdrawing £40,000 in funding because members are unhappy with the design of the tomb.

Leicester Cathedral announced proposals for the £1.3m raised tomb last week, which the Richard III Society has branded 'too modern and stylised'.

The Cathedral, which is set to be the final resting place for the king, responded by saying it will not change the plans for the tomb to secure the donation.

The proposed design for the tomb of Richard III whose skeleton was found in Leicester last year. Members of the Richard III Society have now withdrawn their £40,000 funding for the tomb because they are unhappy with the design

Under the current plans, the raised tomb will feature a deep carved cross and lie on a floor inlaid with a large Yorkist white rose if planning officials approve the project.

The name of the King, his date of birth and death, along with his personal motto Loyaulte me Lie (Loyalty binds Me) and his boar badge will also be carved into a dark circular band around the tomb.

Philippa Langley, of the Richard III Society, said: 'Members feel it is a very difficult design. They think it has been designed with the cathedral in mind, and not for a medieval warrior king.

'What they say, and fear, is that it won't stand the test of time. I pretty much agree with that.

'I
think it is a bit too confused at the moment, a bit too busy and it 
does not reflect that there is a warrior king there beneath the ground.'

However, the cathedral has hit back, saying it will not be 'held hostage' by the society.

Canon Peter Hobson said: 'We have never banked on that money.

'Let's be clear - the money has never come to Leicester Cathedral. We didn't ask for it, it was attached as a 'You give us the tomb we want, and we'll give you £40,000'.

'Of course we would be very grateful for any donation from the members but we can't make our design hostage to their money.'

'Philippa, and those writing to her, bring just a particular perspective. We understand it but we don't think it can be the last word.

'We would rather have their support, but I suppose if you put it that way I would have to say not at any price.'

The plans unveiled last Friday revealed a raised limestone tomb with a deeply carved cross, on a floor inlaid with a large Yorkist white rose.

The tomb will be crafted from limestone quarried in Swaledale, Yorkshire, near to where Richard III underwent his boyhood training in knighthood and later made his home.

The design is now set to be submitted to church planning officials before a final decision is made next month.

Set within the cathedral's chancel, the £1.3 million pound proposals also includes changes to the Cathedral's internal layout, windows and lighting.

Church authorities had originally favoured a flat slab to mark the tomb but changed their plans in the face of strong public feedback.

However, the row between the cathedral and the Richard III Society is not the only obstacle to the king's internment, which is hoped could take place next May.

The process has been complicated by a legal challenge from a group of distant relatives of the king, the Plantagenet Alliance.

They want to see the remains placed in York, where Richard had strong links, and last month won a judicial review of the licence that said he should go to Leicester.
