A forensic pathologist has told the inquest into the death
of Tom Maynard that a number of illicit drugs were discovered in the former Surrey batsman's hair and that he had regularly been using cocaine and MDMA.

A jury returned a verdict of death by accident at the inquest today.

Maynard, 23, was found dead on the railway line at Wimbledon, south-west London,
on the morning of June 18 last year after fleeing police who had tried to get
him to pull over in the nearby Wimbledon Park area while he was driving his
Mercedes.

The cause of death was said to be electrocution caused by
stepping on a live line. The inquest was initially opened on June 22 and then
adjourned.

Forensic pathologist Dr Simon Poole all said old and new hair samples
showed consistent use of cocaine and MDMA in the three-and-a-half months before
death.

Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox described Mr Maynard's death as 'absolutely tragic' and called for analysis of hair samples to be considered for future drugs testing by Surrey County Cricket Club, and other sports clubs, to help identify drug users.

'I pass my sympathies to Mr Maynard's family for the loss they have suffered,' she added.

At the time of his death Maynard was 'heavily intoxicated with alcohol'. His blood alcohol level was 214mg per 100ml, four times over the legal driving limit, which is up to 80mg per 100ml.

The mix of alcohol and cocaine would have had a possibly significant impact on the former England Lions batsman's judgement.

Police were in the Wimbledon area 
looking for youths on mopeds suspected of trying to steal cars when they
saw Maynard in his black Mercedes.

Tribute: Maynard is remembered in the pavilion at The Oval

The police thought it was a stolen car owing to its value and the fact it was being driven at around 4.15am, so they went to investigate.

Police in an unmarked car blocked Maynard in a dead end and put on the blue light. One officer said the former Surrey batsman looked 'nervous and uneasy' and ran off. His BlackBerry was left in the car and the keys were still in the ignition.

An officer chased him after he fled but she was unable to catch him and lost him, so returned to her colleague.

Officers searched Maynard's car but found no drugs were found. Two other officers were called to the scene.

Support: Carly Baker clasps hands with another woman before the inquest

Maynard's former Surrey team-mate Jade Dernbach told the inquest he was unaware that the batsman was using cocaine or any other drug and that he was not known as a drug user among the other players. He added that in some years players can be tested 'eight or nine times, in other years once or twice'.

Dernbach added that on June 17, the night before the tragedy, he, Maynard and Rory Hamilton-Brown had gone for a 'few beers'. The trio then went to Ship Inn in Wandsworth, south-west London, at about 9pm. Dernbach says he had approximately four beers and a couple of shots. He was not aware that Maynard was taking any drugs.

They then went back to the house shared by Maynard and Hamilton-Brown to drink some more before going to Aura nightclub at around midnight.

When they returned, Dernbach went upstairs to bed before Maynard left the house.

Dernbach also gave details of how Maynard was hit by a car in Brighton when drunk 10 days before his death. Maynard was disciplined by Surrey following that incident.

Ability: Maynard had played for the England Lions

Hamilton-Brown also said he did not see Maynard take drugs, describing his former team-mate as 'one of my best friends'.

He added: 'I was jealous of his ability to celebrate highs and lows and stay level.

'I'd describe him as an incredibly level guy with so much talent in all facets of life.'

Maynard's girlfriend, Carly Baker, 
who wept throughout the hearing on Tuesday, said she had spoken to her 
boyfriend at 3.30am: 'He sounded very down and depressed on the phone.

'For me to say "What's wrong" is quite unusual. It was like he needed me.

'He said, "You're the only thing that makes me happy", and he said it three times.'

Miss Baker added that she urged Maynard not to drive to her home as she suspected he had been drinking.

Statement: Tom Maynard's father Matthew (left) and his family said 'the results of the inquest will not define our son'

Through the Professional Cricketers' 
Association, the Maynard family made a statement, saying: 'The results 
of the inquest do not define our son. The fact that so very many people 
thought the world of him is what defines him as a person.

'The only people who would judge Tom 
on the findings of the inquest are people who didn't know him. He made 
choices that night that tragically cost him his life but his devastated 
family and friends will love and miss him unconditionally always.

'He was a very special person and his death leaves a huge hole in all our lives.'

The PCA added that it was, 'saddened by the information which has come to light from the inquest into Tom Maynard’s death, and confirms both its support for Tom’s family, friends and team-mates at this difficult time.'

It also said: 'Cricket has a comprehensive anti-doping programme, which has been in place for a number of years.

'Whilst the focus of this programme is 
primarily on performance-enhancing drugs, it does include in-competition
testing for recreational drugs.

'The very rare incidence of positive 
results suggests that cricket has no more of a problem in this regard 
than society as a whole.

'The PCA is supporting the ECB in its examination of the feasibility of out-of-competition testing for recreational drugs.

'It confirms its support for such an 
initiative as long as it is linked to appropriate arrangements for 
treatment and rehabilitation in the event of a positive test.'

Minute's silence: England and West Indies players remember Tom Maynard before their ODI at The Oval last summer

Following Maynard's death Surrey conducted a review which found: 'Players in leadership positions must always set the very best example, both on and off the pitch.

'Players considered high risk must receive constant guidance; with a development plan that must be adhered to if they are to remain with the Club. Coaches and staff require additional and regular training in order to spot the symptoms of alcohol and drugs use.

'The Club should work harder to create an environment where players in trouble come to us first, so we can help them resolve situations properly and quickly. Other external influences may not always be positive.

'We should initiate a formal process to identify key performance behaviours with full cooperation from all squad members and coaching staff. This will include the adoption of an alcohol and drugs policy which will be applicable to all.

'Surrey CCC will seek to gain the support of players, the England and Wales Cricket Board and Professional Cricketers Association in order to protect players through a drugs policy which includes a more comprehensive social drug testing programme.'

A joint ECB and Surrey statement said: 'In the light of today’s verdict, ECB and Surrey CCC would like to re-iterate that this incident was a terrible human tragedy and again extend our condolences to the Maynard family and to Tom Maynard’s many friends and colleagues within the professional game.

'While the ECB accepts that recreational drug use is a part of modern society, we do not condone it and will take all reasonable steps to prevent its use within the game. We also believe we have a responsibility to educate all our players and are committed to supporting any player who needs help in this area.

'Surrey CCC began its own investigations into conduct at the end of last season and introduced a team-wide anti-drug policy which all players and management are required to abide by. Working in partnership with ECB and PCA further recommendations have been initiated.

'The ECB Board has recently agreed to develop an out-of-competition testing programme to encompass recreational drugs, in co-operation with the PCA.

'These measures will supplement ECB’s existing anti-doping programme which involves in- and out-of-competition testing through UK Anti-Doping in compliance with the WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) Code and financial support which ECB provides to PCA for player education and support programmes.

'The ECB’s testing programme applies 
to all registered County players and up to 200 tests are carried out on 
average each year. This approximates to around 35-40 per cent of the 
overall number of registered professional players. Last year, one player
(Abdur Rehman of Somerset) tested positive for cannabis following an 
in-competition test.

'England players are tested in 
addition as part of the ICC’s own anti-doping programme for all 
international cricketers which are also WADA compliant. To date, no 
England player has tested positive under these programmes.

'ECB and Surrey CCC would like to end
by echoing the statement issued by the Maynard family earlier today. 
The results of this inquest do not define Tom Maynard or alter in any 
way the tragedy of his passing. Tom was a great man and a great 
cricketer and will be remembered forever by everyone who had the 
privilege to know him.'

England one-day batsman Luke Wright 
tweeted: 'All people need to know about Tom Maynard is that he was one 
of the best and kind people you could ever meet. Miss him! Xx'.
