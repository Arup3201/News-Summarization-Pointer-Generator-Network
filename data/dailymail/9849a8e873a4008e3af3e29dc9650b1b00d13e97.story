A 20-year-old allegedly went to the Indianapolis home of his former boss during the middle of the day and murdered the man's wife and daughter after getting fired from his job, court documents claim.

Christian Rene Haley was identified on Thursday as the suspect in the gruesome murder of Marylyn Erb, 52, and Kelley Erb, 23, on Friday December 20 at their house in Westfield.

The two women were found dead in the basement near a pool of blood, according to a probable cause affidavit, with the time of death said to be between noon and 1pm, reported MyDesert.com.

In custody: Christian Haley, 20, stands accused of beating to death the wife and daughter of his former boss after being fired from his job at Sundown Gardens in Indianapolis after three months

Victims: MarylynÂ  Erb, 52 (left) and daughter Kelley Erb, 23 (right) were found dead in the basement of their home near 161st Street and Oak Park Court in Westfield, Indianapolis, after suffering blunt trauma to the head

Scene: Police close off entry to the Erb family home in Westfield, Indianapolis, on December 20 following the double murder

Haley had worked for Todd Erb at the family business Sundown Gardens, a nursery and gardening facility, for about three months.

However he had been fired in June for 'attendance problems'.

The court documents claim Haley bragged to a friend that he 'bashed (the victims') heads in with some cement or something' and that he was angry for getting fired.

Todd Erb told police he was at work on the day of the murder and returned home about 4.30pm to find the bodies of his wife and daughter.

Haley is now facing charges of murder, felony murder, robbery, burglary and theft.

Authorities said Haley stole white pearl earrings, an iPhone 5, a gold-colored chain and two Chase bank cards belonging to the Erbs.

Suspect Christian Haley worked at Sundown Gardens, a nursey owned by Todd Erb, for three months before getting fired in June due to 'attendance problems'

Haley gave the cards to a friend, who then used them at Crown Liquors and a CVS, the affidavit said.

Police received an anonymous Crimestoppers call from a person saying the friend was upset about Haley killing the two women.

Police used CCTV footage from the stores to track down the individual, who confessed Haley had told him about the murders.

Haley was then arrested.

Haley had been to the Erb home before, the affidavit said, and several months ago had talked about robbing the Erbs with a gun.
