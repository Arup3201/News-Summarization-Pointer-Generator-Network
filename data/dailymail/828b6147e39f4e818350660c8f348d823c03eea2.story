Thousands of badgers will be culled this summer in a bid to limit the spread of tuberculosis in cattle.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said yesterday that two pilot schemes can go ahead from June after final licence conditions are met. He said bovine TB was the ‘biggest challenge’ facing livestock in Britain.

A six-week cull will see marksmen shoot 70 per cent of badgers in West Gloucestershire and West Somerset, with up to 5,100 to be killed this year.

Up to 70 per cent of badgers will be culled in the pilot areas in a bid to curb the spread of tuberculous in cattle herds

Thousands more could be culled in the
next three years in an effort to keep numbers below 30 per cent of 
their current population.

A third area, in Dorset, is also being lined up for a possible cull.

Mr Paterson told the National 
Farmers’ Union conference in Birmingham the disease had cost taxpayers 
£500million in the past decade, including compensation to farmers for 
losses.

Costs could reach £1billion over the next decade if the disease is left unchecked, he added.

But campaigners, including Queen guitarist Brian May, have argued the cull will not stop the spread of the disease.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he was determined to avoid any further delays to the cull

The licences for the pilot schemes will allow culling to take place annually over a six-week period for four years. Up to 5,000 badgers will be killed across the two areas.

Mr Paterson said: ‘Bovine TB is spreading at an alarming rate and causing real devastation to our beef and dairy industry.

‘I am determined that there are no further delays this year. That is why we have taken the sensible step with the farming industry to elect a reserve area that can be called upon should anything happen to prevent culling in Somerset or Gloucester.

‘These pilot culls are just one part of our approach to control and eradicate this dreadful disease.’

Research in the UK had shown that culling badgers, which can transmit TB to cattle, could reduce the levels of the disease in herds, and that Britain had to learn from experience elsewhere that the tuberculosis could not effectively be curbed without tackling the problem in wildlife, he said.

He added he wanted to see effective and affordable vaccines deployed for both cattle and badgers as quickly as possible but it was likely to take another decade before the deployment of a cattle vaccine which is validated and legal under EU regulations could take place.

National Farmers' Union president Peter Kendall welcomed the move, saying it would have been easy for the government to let TB slip down the list of priorities after last year's delay.

He backed Mr Paterson for working to ensure that the pilots were up and running this summer and that there would be a full roll-out of the cull next year.

Brian May, Queen guitarist and founder of campaign group Save Me, has led opposition to the plans

He said the move mattered because of the damage TB did to the country's food production base, and described the 35,000 cattle which had to be slaughtered because of the disease in 2012 as a ‘scandalous waste’.

But Labour, which has consistently opposed a badger cull, criticised the decision.

Mary Creagh, the shadow environment secretary, said: ‘The Government is pressing ahead with a badger cull despite 150 000 people signing a petition against it last year and scientists warning against this "untested and risky approach".

‘As incompetent Defra ministers stagger from one crisis to the next, the policing costs, paid by the taxpayer, will balloon to £4 million while bovine TB will increase in the next two years as the shooting displaces badgers.

‘Ministers should listen to the public and the scientists and drop this cull before any more public money is wasted.’
