When Kate Bush gave birth to her only son Bertie, the child's existence was kept secret for more than five years until fellow singer Peter Gabriel inadvertently let it slip during an interview.

Since then, the notoriously private musician has kept her son in the shadows, revealing little to fans and the media other than his name.

Now, that seems set to change after 16-year-old Bertie, an aspiring musician in his own right, joined her on stage at the Hammersmith Apollo last night.

Stepping out of the shadows: The mother of all comebacks was inspired by the son she once tried to hide from the world. Bertie McIntosh - the son Kate Bush had with her husband - sings, acts and dances in the show

Sporting a straw trilby from under which a halo of red curls could be seen, Bertie was one of five backing singers and has been, according to reports, working quietly with his mother for the last few years.

'He gave me the courage to push the button,' said Bush during last night's performance. 'Thank you Bertie. It's been a fantastic adventure so far. And it's only just begun.'

So who is Bertie McIntosh? Born in 1998, his very existence was kept secret for years and he continues to live quietly with his mother and father David McIntosh in Berkshire.

Known to be hugely supportive of his mother, he joined her at the Dorchester Hotel as she picked up a South Bank Arts award, watching proudly from the sidelines.

But like his parents, music is his real passion and he has a track named after him on 2005 album Aerial and boasts singing credits on another track, Somewhere In Between.

Still secretive: Kate Bush remains a private person and covered her face with her hands as she was driven away

And his mother certainly appears to appreciate it. As well as his mention on stage, Bush also wrote glowingly of her son in the programme.

'Without my son Bertie, this would never
 have happened,' she wrote. 'Without his encouragement and enthusiasm, particularly 
in the early stages when I was very frightened to commit to pushing the "go" button, I'm sure I would have backed out.

'Throughout he has been my chief 
consultant, my editor, my confidant. In order for him to be part of 
this, which has always part of the deal, he has had to work really hard 
in order to keep his school commitments as well as his commitments to 
the show.

'He is a very talented actor and 
beautiful singer, as you will witness and he brings something special to
 the show through his presence. Thank you Bertie. Thank you so much.'

As for Bertie himself, all he was prepared to say was to modestly note that he hopes his performances will allow him to 'earn his keep'. A chip off the old block if ever there was one.

Big moment: Passionate fans such as Ian Harris, 67, waited 35 years for her to return to the stage

Big night: Last night's appearance at the Hammersmith Apollo was the first of a scheduled run of 22 concerts
