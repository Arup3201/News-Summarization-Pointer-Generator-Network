Planes carrying hundreds of British holidaymakers came within 500ft of each other in a near-miss at Malaga Airport in southern Spain.

Aviation authorities said the pilot of a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 from Leeds was forced to abort its landing and take evasive action at the last minute because a Glasgow-bound Jet2 plane - also a 737-800 - was still on the runway in front of it.

Spain’s Civil Aviation Accident and Incident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC) has launched an investigation into the September 17 incident. The two planes were carrying a total of 363 passengers and crew.

Boeing 737-800s operated by Ryanair and Jet2 were involved in a 'loss of separation' at Malaga Airport

According to a preliminary report, the planes experienced what is known as ‘a loss of separation’ at 1:20pm local time as the Ryanair flight was coming in for landing and the Jet 2 flight was taking off.

The report said the Ryanair pilot was forced to take evasive action while the plane was almost on the threshold of the runway and the Jet2 flight was in its initial climb.

Radar data suggest the Ryanair plane, carrying six crew and 167 passengers, overflew the Jet2 aircraft with a vertical separation of just 400 to 500ft and no horizontal distance shortly after the Jet2 plane became airborne with six crew and 184 passengers on board, according to the Aviation Herald.

The incident occurred in the Mediterranean resort city over two weeks ago but wasn’t publicly reported until Friday when Spain’s civil aviation authority published a preliminary report on its website.

A spokeswoman for Ryanair said there was no near-miss and insisted it was a routine ‘go-around’ flight procedure.

The airline said in a statement: ‘This flight from Leeds to Malaga performed a routine go-around on approach into Malaga as the runway was occupied by another aircraft.

‘The go-around was uneventful and the aircraft landed safely shortly after. Ryanair will cooperate fully with the CIAIAC investigation into this matter.’

In its report, the CIAIAC said: ‘The operations performed by each aircraft were hampered by being carried on the same runway heading.’

After the incident, both planes continued with their flight plan and landed safely. No injuries were reported and there was no damage to the aircraft.

A final report containing all of the investigation’s findings will be published once the probe is complete.
