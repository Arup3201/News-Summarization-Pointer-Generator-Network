A dangerous rescue dog which was on the verge of being put down due to its vicious nature has been saved after it settled down and found love... with a goose.

Rex the German Shepherd was so vicious it would take two people to feed him, one to distract him and the other to throw a bowl of food into his enclosure.

But his temper changed after Geraldine the goose arrived at the animal sanctuary where he was staying.

True love: Rex was once a snarling German Shepherd who couldn't be fed by hand but the influence of Geraldine has seen him become placid pooch

At first the owners at the Puriton Horse and Animal Rescue centre feared Rex would attack the bird if it strayed into his territory.

But the first time they got near one another, their reaction was one of affection more than aggression.

The pair are now allowed to run free together and even sleep Rex's bed every night.

Staff have been surprised by how close they have become and believe the once angry bird and growling dog bring out the softer side in each.

'It's so comical to see them because they love each other to bits', said Sheila Brislin, who runs the centre near Bridgwater, Somerset.

The pair were initially kept apart at their animal sanctuary, but after being allowed near one another they have now become best friends

Sheila Brislin, who runs the Puriton Horse and Animal Rescue centre, said: 'It's so comical to see them because they love each other to bits'

'She just runs around alongside him all day long and whenever we take him for a walk in the woods she has to come too.

'They are very affectionate and he's always licking her head. She snuggles into him and they sleep together every night.

'Normally any bird that crossed his path would have been eaten by now, he's that kind of dog, but not Geraldine.

'I've been doing rescue work since 1997 and seen all kinds of strange animal behaviour, but I've never seen anything like this.'

Rex, aged 11, came to the sanctuary after he was found tethered by a chain in a scrapyard eight years ago.

Both of the animals were rescued from owners who couldn't control them, workers at the sanctuary believe they are kindred spirits because there were both so feisty

Sheila added: 'They were going to give him a lethal injection to put him down because he had bitten everybody at his previous shelter and there was nothing they could do with him.

'They were so scared of him one worker had to distract him at the front of the run while the other threw his food in at the back.'

But since Rex met Geraldine he's a changed animal.

'They snuggle down together and Rex puts his leg over her to protect her. In the morning they have breakfast together. It's really sweet to see them.'

It used to take two people to feed Rex, one to distract him while another put his bowl down. But he is a changed dog since meeting Geraldine

But not everybody is smitten with the romance and Rex's former friend Vera, also a German Shepherd, is upset after being ousted by the green-eyed goose.

'Geraldine doesn't like Vera at all and makes it quite clear that Rex is hers', said Sheila.

'She goes on the attack if she comes anywhere near and Vera is scared of her.

'We've had to give Vera lots of cuddles and attention so she doesn't feel left out.'
