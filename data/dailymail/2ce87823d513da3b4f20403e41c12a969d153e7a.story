It has been described as the hug seen around the world - the wonderful moment that Jim Routon discovered his seven year old neighbor Hezekiah Darbon had survived the Oklahoma tornado and scooped him up in his arms.

Appearing on Good Morning America to talk about their emotional reunion, Hezekiah revealed that the embrace from the man he calls 'Big Dog' made him feel safe - despite the scenes of utter devastation that surrounded the pair following Monday's deadly tornado in Moore.

In turn, Routon described rushing, part in terror and part in desperation to rescue the children of Briarwood Elementary, only to discover the boy he calls 'Little Dog' was alive and well, leading to his spontaneous reaction as he squeezed the young boy in his arms.

Emotional Reunion: Jim Routon hugs Hezekiah Darbon at Briarwood Elementary school after a tornado destroyed the school in south Oklahoma City, Monday, May 20, 2013

'When we got to the school it was pretty much chaos and destruction and people were just running in all directions trying to find their children - it was really a surreal event,' explained Routon to GMA on Wednesday morning.

'The reunion was pretty special, he wasn't hurt. By the grace of God they made it all out safe.

'I felt like I needed that hug as much as he did.'

Little Hezekiah, who is the son of Routon's neighbors, Joe and Dawn, said that he 'was so happy to see him and I didn't know that he was coming.'

Talking about their relationship together, Routon told GMA that he sees Hezekiah as his 'part-time kid' - always over at his home in Moore, to play.

'He calls me big dog and I call him little dog,' said Routon.

'We have quite a relationship, he comes over, we play basketball and throw footballs around - he is kind of our part time kid.'

During the course of the interview it was revealed that Hezekiah's parents were in a different town when the tornado struck - meaning they had to remain where they were until the warning passed.

Monday's EF5 strength tornado reduced much of Moore to rubble, killing 24 people and injuring over 237 people.

Leveling Briarwood Elementary School, the initial fears of the parents who rushed to the school were of a disaster of tragic proportions.

Speaking last night on CNN, Hezekiah and Jim explained how they came to find each other, surrounded by a scene which resembled a war zone.

'I saw you and ran up to you and just jumped on you and I knew that you were gonna pick me up so I just jumped,' said Hezekiah on CNN.'And you picked me up and I just started hugging you really hard and I was crying a little bit and I was happy I survived.'

For his part, a still emotional Routon was just as choked by the meeting as his little dog.

'I felt like I needed that hug as much as he did at that time.'

'There was just so much chaos we just weren't sure, the school was pretty much devastated and destroyed and we just weren't sure if anyone was gonna come out alive.'

The storm, which barreled through the
Oklahoma City suburb for 17 miles on Monday, injured 237 people and 
killed at least 24, including ten children. On Wednesday, six people remained missing.

The heartbreaking-to-read Twitter hashtag #OKMissing has been set 
up to help families and friends search for missing loved ones.

On Monday, emergency workers pulled more than 100 survivors from the debris of homes, schools and a hospital.

Injuries
of adult patients ranged from minor — cuts and bruises, people wet and 
suffering from hypothermia to major injuries including open wounds, 
impalements and broken bones. There were also 'degloving' injuries, in 
which skin is peeled from the tissue.

The weather service confirmed on Tuesday that the powerful storm was an EF5 - the maximum on the scale.

Seven
of the children were found asphyxiated at Plaza Towers Elementary School, 
which was a direct hit during the 45 minutes of terror.

Photographer Paul Hellstern arrived at Briarwood only minutes after the tornado had passed over and it was he who captured the now iconic images of teachers leading their children away from the scene.'I'd just arrived, probably five minutes after the tornado passed and came into that neighborhood and noticed that school there and children pouring out,' he told CNN's Chris Cuomo.

'It was pandemonium with children crying everywhere, bloody teachers and so forth.'
