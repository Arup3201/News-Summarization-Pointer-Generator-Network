A mother and daughter who were trapped in Brazil after a judge confiscated their passports during an international child custody dispute have finally been allowed to return to the U.S. 

Shauna Hadden, a 33-year-old social worker from Agawam, Massachusetts, and her six-year-old daughter Ava flew back to America on Friday.

Ms Hadden brought her daughter Ava to 
Brazil on May 21 so the girl could build a relationship with her father after not 
seeing him in four years.

Finally home: Shauna Hadden, a 33-year-old social worker from Massachusetts and her six-year-old daughter Ava flew back to America on Friday after being stuck in Brazil since May

Ordeal: The mother and daughter were now back at their Massachusetts home

However when they landed, ex-husband 
Donizete Machado told Ms Hadden, who has full custody in the U.S., that 
she was in his country now and that 'things are going to change', according to NBC.

The mother fled with her daughter to a different part of Brazil, fearing that her daughter would be seized. 

A lawyer for the 32-year-old 
father reportedly had authorities seize their 
passports because Ms Hadden hadn't let him visit with Ava.

The lawyer also claimed Hadden used airline tickets Machado paid for to fly over and meet a boyfriend.

Shauna created a Facebook page called Trapped in Brazil to draw attention to her 
plight and beg for help from American authorities.

On
the page, which has more than 12,000 likes, she claimed her ex-husband filed a custody suit for Ava in the Brazilian court as
soon as they touched town in the country and police officers with guns 
confiscated their passports.

However on Friday she updated the page with the message: 'We are home!!!!!! Love you all thank you all.'

The single mother said that she also feared she would lose her job after being stranded in Brazil for almost two months.

Custody battle: When his ex-wife and daughter landed in Brazil, Donizete Machado reportedly launched a legal battle to keep his daughter in the country

Shauna met and married Machado in the U.S. They had Ava in 2007 and divorced in 2009, before he was deported in 2010 for being in the country illegally - something Shauna knew nothing about.

Since then, Shauna has rebuilt their 
relationship for Ava's sake, and the father and daughter have had 
regular contact over Skype.

As such, she thought it would be OK to organize a visit, adding : 'We thought it was a great opportunity for Ava to learn about her heritage.'

However after receiving a warning about Machado's intentions, Ms Hadden took her daughter to stay with friends.

Battle: The custody battle began when the mother and daughter touched down in Brazil in May

Help: Shauna said she has spent more than $6000 in lawyers' fees

'He and his sisters started sending my daughter nasty messages saying things like ''You're going to have to stay in Brazil forever,''' she said.

Frightened, Shauna decided to get on a plane back to the U.S. but Machado had cancelled their return tickets.

On June 6, she discovered Machado had filed for custody and the same day officers showed up at the friends' home with guns.

The U.S. Embassy in Brazil told Shauna to get an attorney, which she did and has spent more than $6,000 on lawyers fees, her mother said last month.

Visit: Shauna took 6-year-old Ava to Brazil so that Ava could see her father
