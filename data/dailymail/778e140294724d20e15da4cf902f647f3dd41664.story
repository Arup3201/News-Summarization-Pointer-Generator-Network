A missing snowmobiler from Arizona who was lost in a freezing Utah canyon was rescuved Monday after being lost for nearly two days.

Lawrence Orduno's snowmobile got stuck in a remote northern Utah canyon Saturday night and built a snow cave using pieces of his snowmobile to protect him from the freezing temperatures.  

Orduno tried for 30 minutes to dig his snowmobile out after he and a friend were separated while riding in the Franklin Basin area near logan.

'It was just too deep in the snow, standing straight up and down,' Orduno said.

Orduno's friend made it back to the parking lot, but Orduno wasn't familiar with the area, and soon was lost in Logan Canyon as an icy storm rolled in, according to FOX. 

'To be honest, we don't know if he would have made it one more night,' Lt. Doyle Peck told FOX.

Search and rescue crews from Cache, Rich, Box Elder, and Franklin counties led by the Cache County Sheriff's Office combed the area for Orduno.

Around 10am Monday, one of the crews found Orduno in Cow Canyon miles from where he and his friend began their journey, according to a Facebook post by the Sheriff's Office. 

'Mr. Orduno was cold and wet but in relatively good condition,' the post reads. 'Although he suffered mild frostbite to one of his toes, he is expected to make a full recovery.'

The storm rolled in that Saturday night and, with dark quickly approaching, Orduno decided to hunker down for the night.  

Orduno accidently left his food behind in the truck that day, and thought he'd lost his cigarette lighter.

But as he shook out his pants to remove caked snow just before dark, the lighter appeared, caught in the bottom of his pant leg.

He shaped the snow around him into a cave-like shelter and used the side covers from his snowmobile to help protect him from the wind, then collected wood and built a small fire. 

He crushed his two bottles of Gatorade that had frozen solid to free some ice and stay hydrated, but it wasn't much.

Orduno is an avid snowmobiler who had been riding in the area before, and he went out with a 27-year-old friend while visiting his mother, who lives in the area.

Halted: Search and rescue crews from Cache, Rich, Box Elder, and Franklin counties led by the Cache County Sheriff's Office searched for Orduno all day Sunday but their search was halted by the blistering snow

Orduno said he got stuck in Boss Canyon, which is off the beaten path but just over a ridge from more popular snowmobiling areas. He heard a machine go by at one point, but he couldn't flag it down.

Meanwhile, a search party led by the Cache County Sheriff's Office was combing the area for him, but the group was stymied by heavy snow.

Orduno says he started to worry the second night and considered taking more desperate measures, including setting his machine on fire.

But about 10 a.m. the next day, searchers taking a slightly different path spotted him.

'My story is really just another story of a guy out in the snow getting stuck,' he said.

Orduno said he's grateful to the dozens of people who joined the search.

'I have no way of knowing all the people,' he said.  'I just want to tell them all thank you for all of their help.'
