Escaped: Murderer Anthony Craig, 66, fled to Ireland and married a local woman during more than a decade at large - after police failed to publicise the fact he was on the run

An escaped murderer fled to Ireland and married a local woman during more than a decade at large – after police failed to publicise the fact he was on the run.

Anthony Craig, 66, had been transferred to an open prison despite previously spending a month at large when he slipped away from prison officers during a compassionate visit to his sick brother.

The killer had served a total of 28 years by the time he walked out of Sudbury prison in July 2002, travelling to Ireland where he drifted around doing casual work as an odd-job man.

In 1973 the former labourer had lured accountant John Kirby to a park after meeting him at a well-known gay pub, robbed him for just 2p and then battered him over the head with a stone.

Police failed to make an appeal for Craig’s recapture until 18 months later, saying they did not have a photograph of him – a statement subsequently branded untrue in Parliament.

By then he had fled to the Republic of Ireland where he eventually settled in rural County Leitrim, marrying a local woman, in 2006. His grim past might never have caught up with him had he not telephoned Irish police last year to report a suspected prowler, only for them to realise he was a wanted man.

A court in Dublin has now ordered his extradition back to England where he faces being returned to prison to resume his life sentence.

Yesterday a friend of his victim criticised the authorities’ failure to trace Craig sooner.

Mr Kirby, the accountant son of a Second World War RAF pilot, lived with his widowed mother Margaret in Samlesbury, Lancashire where neighbours this week recalled him being ‘well-spoken and always smartly dressed’.

He was drinking at a gay pub in nearby Blackburn in November 1973 when petty criminal Craig – known as Tony - lured him to a nearby by park and killed him after attempting to rob him.

An only child, Mr Kirby’s body was found the following morning lying by a dog walker.

Craig was jailed for life the following year. He first went on the run in 1995, during compassionate leave to visit his sick brother in 1995.  Craig gave himself the following month, and was later transferred to an open prison, Sudbury jail in Derbyshire.

He walked out in July 2002, but police only revealed he was on the run 18 months later in January 2004.

At the time, local MP Patrick 
McLoughlin – now Transport Secretary – told the Commons Derbyshire 
Police had claimed not to have a photograph of Craig and that ‘no 
publicity was given’ to his absconsion, when in fact the force had 
‘decided not to release’ the photo.

Craig’s
 whereabouts were by then unknown, but the Daily Mail has established 
that he settled in Cork before moving to rural County Leitrim where he 
met his future wife, Dorothy.  The couple shared her isolated run-down 
smallholding, with Craig telling neighbours he had moved to Ireland 
after 25 years in the navy.

Craig was arrested in February last year, after reporting a suspected prowler to Gardai.

The
 grey-haired fugitive was hauled to court where he pleaded not to be 
sent back, saying: ‘I have rehabilitated – Ireland has given me a 
chance.’

After a succession of court 
hearings, the High Court in Dublin last week finally ordered his 
extradition back to England, bailing Craig until next month pending a 
possible appeal.

Yesterday 
the son of former neighbours of Mr Kirby, airline pilot Derek Barnes, 
55, told of his shock that Craig was able to spent 12 years at large 
abroad.

Mr Barnes, who as a
 12-year-old used to share bus rides home with the murder victim, said: 
‘It’s completely not right. I’m extremely shocked.

‘Certainly
 I would have expected someone to serve their term. He should return to 
serve the rest of the term for which he was sentenced.’

Blackburn
 MP Jack Straw – Home Secretary until 2001 - said: ‘This was a very 
shocking crime, and it’s important that this man is brought back to 
serve the rest of his sentence.

‘It doesn’t reflect well on the system that he was at large for such a long time.’

A
 Ministry of Justice spokesman said that keeping the public safe was 
Justice Secretary Chris Grayling’s ‘top priority’, with prisoner 
‘absconds’ down 80 per cent over the last ten years. The statement 
added: ‘Open prisons and temporary licence are an important tool in 
rehabilitating long term offenders but not at the expense of public 
safety.’

Derbyshire Police said it was still investigating the decision-making process that followed Craig’s escape.

Open prisons have been at the centre of controversy after a spate of criminals walked out.

The most notorious was Michael Wheatley, dubbed the Skullcracker, who fled from HMP Standford Hill, Kent, in May, and was caught after a huge manhunt.

In June, we told how murdered David Richards, 53, walked out of Sudbury prison and went on the run for nine years until Daily Mail reporters traced him to an address in Wolverhampton after being tipped off about his case. 

Last week the Mail revealed 137 inmates absconded from open prisons last year, with union leaders claiming the wrong people were being sent to them because of the huge pressure on the system.
