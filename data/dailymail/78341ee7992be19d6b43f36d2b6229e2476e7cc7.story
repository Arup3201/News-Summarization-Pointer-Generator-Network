Barack Obama's campaign released a promotional ad featuring the stars of famed stoner movie Harold and Kumar, appealing to even the biggest slackers to watch coverage of the Democratic National Convention online.

In the short video, it shows the President making a serious call to someone, urging them to be 'on board' and urging them to 'get this right' because 'there's a lot at stake'.

When he hangs up, the ad pans to the other end of the phone call which shows actor Kal Penn hanging up his cell while sitting on a couch watching television next to his costar John Cho.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

'Hey this is Barack': In the ad, Obama is seen imploring Penn (right, with Harold and Kumar co-star John Cho) to be at the DNC because people are 'counting on him'

Before throwing back a chip, Cho says the call sounded 'intense' and the duo become distracted by a hilarious cartoon.

Penn
is hosting the digital streaming of the Democratic Convention's final 
day, which includes the President's acceptance speech.

Cho
and Penn are best known for their roles in the Harold and Kumar films, 
which portray the hijinks of two potheads who have an affinity for White
Castle burgers and knack for getting in tricky situations.

While
that may seem like an odd choice for a political representative, Penn 
has a much longer history with the Obama administration.

Friendly fist-bump: Kal Penn greets First Lady Michelle Obama on the stage of the Democratic National Convention on Monday as she went through a practice of her speech that she will give Tuesday night

Hugs: Penn worked for the Obama administration extensively since the 2008 election but took a break at one point to film the third movie in the Harold and Kumar franchise

Heading south: President Obama left the White House on Tuesday for Norfolk, Virginia for a campaign event

He started doing advocacy work for the president in the 2008 campaign before the New Jersey-native took a two year break from acting in order to work as a member of Obama's National Arts Policy Committee.

He was later promoted to Associate Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement.

Because of a prior contract commitment to star in the third Harold and Kumar movie, Penn left the government post for three months in 2010 so that he could film the franchise' A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas.

Two sides of his career: Kal Penn became involved with the Obama administration shortly after the 2008 election (left) but took a break to film the third Harold And Kumar film due to contractual obligations (right)

According to ABC News, he returned to a similar position in the Office of Public Engagement in November shortly after the midterm elections, though he also made several campaign appearances for different Democrats during that hiatus.

No word on whether or not Cho will also be making an appearance- or even if he is a Democrat- but Penn has already been spotted at the Convention in Charlotte as he greeted the First Lady on stage yesterday when she went to practice for her speech tonight.
