If you are hunting for the ultimate in luxury air travel, look no further.

Qatar Airways has unveiled its new Airbus A380 jet, which features an almost unrivalled first-class cabin.

The upper deck of the plane features eight first-class 'suites' - ultra-wide seats which each measure 23 inches wide, and which are covered in a soft woven fabric, leather and decorated with engraved copper.

Each seat converts to a fully flat 2.2 metre-long bed, while each passenger gets their own wardrobe with pockets containing slippers, pyjamas and Giorgio Armani and Christian Dior amenity kits.

Passengers are also treated to remotely controlled adjustable lighting and electrically operated window blinds, in addition to a huge video library that even features a special section devoted to Tom Cruise films.

There is also a 48cm personal HD video screen with a 3.8in touchscreen controller and a table which folds out to create a dining table for two people.

The first class cabin also features two bathrooms which the airline claims 'create a spa-like warmth'.

The taps are sensor-operated, while the room features a large sink, a wardrobe and is big enough to act as a changing room.

Tucked away towards the rear of the A380's upper deck is a spacious inflight lounge and bar, which has been described as 'a sanctuary in the sky'.

Qatar says the lounge not only 'offers passengers an escape from the typical airplane environment' but has been designed to exude the feel of a private 'executive club'.

Under the stunning chandeliers, inspired by contemporary Arabian design, passengers are treated to vases of fresh flowers throughout the lounge and a large leather settee.

Both first class and business class guests are offered an on-demand, á la carte menu which includes caviar and desserts from luxury French bakery, Laduree.

Qatar's Airbus A380 is the world's largest airliner, and can seat as many as 525 passengers in total across a three-class cabin layout.

The aircraft has been configured to seat 517 passengers on twin decks - eight in first class, 48 in business, and 461 in economy.

It has a range of up to 8,500 nautical miles.

Fares for the first class roundtrip between London and Doha are 5,000 euros (£3,936).

The state-owned flag carrier of Qatar has ordered ten of the planes and they will be available on its Doha-London Heathrow and Doha to Paris routes, starting on October 10th.

Qatar Airways is vying with other Gulf airlines to showcase innovative features and comforts on board. Abu Dhabi's Etihad is also due to start A380 services soon, joining the largest A380 customer Emirates of Dubai.

Qatar Airways took delivery of its first A380 last month in Hamburg, Germany. 

The firm had initially hoped to take delivery of the plane on May 30th and start the London service in mid-June, but suspended delivery of the first three aircraft over what it described as problems with the workmanship in the cabin.
