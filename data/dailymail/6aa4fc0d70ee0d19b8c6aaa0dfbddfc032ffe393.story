They include Park View School in Alum Rock, Gracelands Nursery school in Sparkbrook and Golden Hillock School in Sparkhill.

Birmingham
 City Council published today a list of 18 schools which are under 
investigation by Ofsted over the alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot. 

The institutions are:

Adderley Primary School, Saltley

Alston Primary School, Saltley

Golden Hillock School, Sparkhill

Gracelands Nursery School, Sparkbrook

Highfield Junior and Infant School, Saltley

Ladypool Primary School, Sparkbrook

Marlborough Junior School, Small Heath

Montgomery Primary Academy, Sparkbrook

Nansen Primary, Saltley

Ninestiles School, Acocks Green

Oldknow Academy, Small Heath

Park View School, Alum Rock

Regents Park Community Primary School, Small Heath

Saltley School and Specialist Science College, Saltley

Small Heath School, Small Heath

Washwood Heath Academy, Stechford

Waverley School, Bordesley Green

Welford Primary School, Handsworth

One school is even being investigated over allegations that the al Qaeda-linked Muslim preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who died in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, was praised in assembly.

Sir Albert
 Bore, council leader, said Ofsted was not intending to publish its
 final inspection reports until 'the first or second week of May'.

He added that he has not yet seen the draft version of the inspection reports, which have been carried out at the request of Education Secretary Michael Gove.

In an investigation progress briefing today, Sir Albert also criticised the apparent leaking of an Education Funding Agency (EFA)
 report into three city academies to a national newspaper.

He said the Government Cabinet Office is currently investigating how the document was obtained by the media.

The 'Trojan Horse' allegations first came to light earlier this year, contained in an anonymous and unsigned letter.

They have prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted.

On Saturday, The Daily Telegraph reported that six of the schools at the centre of the iinquiry faced being placed in special measures.

Sir Albert described the leaking of the EFA report as 'wholly reprehensible' - adding that one school had been inaccurately included in press articles when it was unconnected with the current inquiries.

Although 25 schools are involved in three separate investigations into the plot, the city council's chief executive, Mark Rogers, said he was in 'no position' to identify the remaining seven schools because inquiries were still 'in the early stages'.

The council’s investigation is being headed by former headteacher Ian Kershaw, who is sifting through about 200 concerns raised since the alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot emerged.

Meanwhile,while the DfE has appointed its own education commissioner, the former head of the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit Peter Clarke.

Officials: The city council's chief executive, Mark Rogers (left), said today he was in 'no position' to identify the remaining seven schools. Right, Peter Clarke has been appointed as the DfE's education commissioner

The DfE announced Mr Clarke’s 
appointment on April 15 - prompting dismay from teachers’ leaders, 
Muslim community members and the chief constable of West Midlands Police
 Chris Sims.

They described it as 'desperately unfortunate', and a decision which would be misinterpreted by some people, given his anti-terror background.

But the DfE said his experience of high-level investigations meant he was the right man to carry out his role effectively, while acting in a 'professional and dispassionate manner'

Request: The inspections are being carried out at the direct request of Education Secretary Michael Gove

Mr Rogers said it was the council understanding that Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, had been over-seeing its inquiry for some time.

He added that Sir Michael would likely publish an 'overview report' at the same time as the individual school reports were released.

Both Mr Clarke and Sir Michael have separately spoken with the council in recent weeks - and Mr Rogers said he was still working 'to persuade' the latter to give the local authority 'early sight' of the Ofsted reports.

It comes as the council has announced the make-up of its Trojan Horse review group, which Mr Kershaw will report to.

It includes Kamal Hanif, the headteacher of Waverley Primary School - one of the schools which has been inspected by Ofsted - Liam Byrne, the Labour MP for Hodge Hill, and David Urquhar, the Bishop of Birmingham, as well as an unnamed senior Muslim community member.

Sir Albert said he had asked for a single joint investigation by the council, DfE and Ofsted - but 'for whatever reason, the Secretary of State (Michael Gove) decided he wanted to go it alone and appoint Peter Clarke'.

He said: Ofsted and the Secretary of State will operate in whatever manner they so wish.'

Mr Rogers added: 'We don’t condone the Secretary of State’s appointment, but one small part of explanation is we do expect Peter Clarke to have a wider brief than just Birmingham. so in one sense we can understand he might want separation.

'But the value of collaborating is clear. Nobody wants to have to go through the evidence three times or have multiple reports.'
