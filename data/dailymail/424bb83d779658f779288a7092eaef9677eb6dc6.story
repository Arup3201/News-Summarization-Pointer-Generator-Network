A race doesn't have to be fast to be thrilling, and these two snails proved that after they battled their way towards a fruity prize.

The lead swung to-and-fro as the hungry molluscs made their way up a toadstool - each seemingly as desperate as the other to claim the bright red cherry on top.

The snail with the speckled shell took an early lead - as its spiral-shelled opponent got off to a slow start and was left dawdling at the bottom.

But refusing to let the race slip away, Spiral Shell dragged itself back into contention - until the pair were neck-and-neck (or antenna-and-antenna) just below the fungus's flat top.

Spiral Shell looked as if it was about to pull off a classic underdog story as it hauled itself up over the lip first.

But Speckled Shell is not one to play by the rules, and rather than going straight for the cherry itself, decided to fright dirty and attack its opponent instead.

However, as films have taught us, the good guy always prevails in the end.

Spiral Shell managed to fight off its underhanded foe to victoriously slither up to take the juicy prize.

It took a hard-earned chomp at the glazed fruit as Speckled Shell slunk back down the toadstool in disgrace - perhaps to consider its tactics for next time.

The amusing sequence of photos was taken by macro photographer Anatolih Evgenii, 48, using his own pet snails.  

The Russian said: 'I love to create interesting scenarios for my pet snails.

'I thought it would be fun to organise a race as snails are notorious for being slow creatures.

'It wasn't easy to photograph but once they noticed the cherry they definitely seemed to speed up.

'Unfortunately only one could win, but I did make sure they shared the winnings.'
