A career criminal nicknamed Safari Boy is back behind bars – 21 years and more than 100 convictions after a ‘character-building’ African junket failed to break his cycle of offending.

Mark Hook, 38, raided a cottage while its elderly tenant was away, trashing the property and escaping with a digital camera and more than £140 in cash.

Yesterday victim Frederick Talbot, an 86-year-old widower, said the serial burglar would never change his ways after the Daily Mail informed him of Hook’s notorious past.

Hook first appeared in court in 1991 when he admitted taking a car without consent. In 1993 he was sent on an 88-day holiday, which included a Kenyan safari, by social services to show him how worse-off people in the world coped without resorting to crime.

The trip caused a national furore and was denounced by critics who said it would not reform the teenager. John Major, the then prime minister, told MPs no offenders would be sent on trips abroad again.

Early the next year Hook appeared in court over 34 offences including burglary and taking a car without consent. In adulthood he developed a heroin and crack cocaine habit which he sustained through crime in a cycle of offending and jail terms.

On Friday, Hook appeared at Gloucester Crown Court via video link from a prison remand wing to admit stealing property including chequebooks, a passport and a pillow case from a cottage on the Stancombe Park Estate in North Nibley, Gloucestershire. Judge Jamie Tabor QC remanded him for pre-sentence reports and adjourned the case until next month.

Yesterday Mr Talbot said he had been away when Hook raided the rented property. The retired Stancombe estate manager said: ‘He made a hell of a mess, pulling out every drawer he could after squeezing through a tiny bathroom window.

‘The police never told me anything about his background. He took £26 from a money box which my grandchildren had saved, my national service medal, £120 in two pound coins which I was saving and a digital camera.’

Referring to Hook’s £7,000 trip to Kenya and Egypt as a 17-year-old, Mr Talbot added: ‘I just hope he gets a good jail sentence now. Holiday or no holiday, he will obviously never change his ways.’

Hook claims to be a descendant of Henry Hook, who won the Victoria Cross fighting Zulus at Rorke’s Drift in 1879. The battle inspired the film Zulu in which Private Hook, who is buried in Churcham, near Gloucester, was portrayed by James Booth.

Mr Talbot said Private Hook would be ‘turning in his grave’ over his descendant’s criminal record.

The pensioner moved to the cottage on his retirement in 1992. Previous occupant Geoffrey Hook was a distant relative of the career criminal. His widow Tessa, 81, said Hook was also suspected of burgling them when they lived at the cottage. She said: ‘We lost money and jewellery, but I can’t remember if he was ever prosecuted or convicted for it.’

Until Friday, Hook’s last criminal conviction – his 113th – was in July 2012 when he was jailed for 18 months for mugging a woman shopper and handling property stolen from another woman robbery victim.

At what was then Hook’s 32nd court appearance, Judge Tabor told Gloucester Crown Court the defendant was a ‘perpetual villain’.

Hook was one of a host of young offenders pampered by the justice system in the 1990s. In previous years the delinquents would have been locked up in Borstals or sent to approved schools. But in the mid 1990s there were a string of misguided attempts to put them on the straight and narrow.

Clinton Bowen was treated to a three-month £12,000 barge holiday in 1997. The 15-year-old who became known as Canal Boy grew up to be a drug addict who specialised in raiding the homes of the elderly.

His brother Casey earned the name Pocket Money Boy when he was paid £60 a week after 37 arrests between 1992 and 1994. After paying out £1,560, social services stopped the money because his offending increased.

Jason Cooper was called World Tour Boy after going on holidays costing the taxpayer £50,000 to ‘instil feelings of self-worth by broadening his horizons’. He progressed to a life in and out of jail for crimes including conspiracy to rob a post office, burglary, fraud and car crime. He even tried to sue social services claiming he had not been taught basic life skills such as how to claim benefits.
