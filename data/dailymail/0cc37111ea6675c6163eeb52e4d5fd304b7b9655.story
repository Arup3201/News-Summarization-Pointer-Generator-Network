UK warships are to benefit from an unmanned 'eye in the sky' as part of a new multimillion-pound contract.

The unarmed ScanEagle aircraft is to be used by the Royal Navy and will launch from the back of ships to fly above them.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has announced it will use the craft to collect intelligence and scout out the surrounding areas.

ScanEagle has a built-in electro-optical and infrared camera with communications range over 62 miles.

The craft can fly for more than 20 hours.

ScanEagle has a 3.1 metre wingspan and is 1.4metres long.

It weights 44 pounds (20 kg) and can travel at a maximum speed of 80 knots, with an average cruising speed of around 50 to 60 knots.

The pneumatic launcher is known as the 'SuperWedge' launcher.

It is recovered using the 'Skyhook' retrieval system, which uses a hook on the end of the wingtip to catch a rope hanging from a pole.

It does this by using GPS units mounted on the top of the pole and UAV.

Each ScanEagle system comes with four air vehicles, a ground control station, remote video terminal, and the Skyhook launch and recovery system.

With a wingspan of just over three metres and weighing 22kg, the 'eye in the sky' will be launched from Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships by a pneumatic catapult.

It will then will fly at around 60 knots - although can reach speeds of up to 80 knots - for more than 20 hours.

It is commanded by a specialist team on board the ship.

This team plan its missions then control its flights, analysing the information it gathers using state-of-the-art sensors, before bringing it back to the ship.

Built by Insitu, a subsidiary of Boeing Defence UK Limited, the ScanEagle is being introduced as part of a £30 million contract signed by the MoD.

It has been used by other nations but is the first 'maritime-specific unmanned air system capability' being used in support of naval operations, said the MoD.

ScanEagle will add to current intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance methods such as helicopters and long-range radar.

Royal
 Navy Captain Ian Annett, said: 'ScanEagle represents an important 
addition to the Royal Navy's intelligence, surveillance and 
reconnaissance capability.

'Its
 ability to deploy during the day and night coupled with the technology 
it uses, will give commanders a clearer picture of the operational 
situation whenever it's required.'

With a wingspan of just over three metres and weighing 22kg, the ScanEagle 'eye in the sky' will be launched from Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary ships. It gathers data using built-in sensors and then takes this information back to the ship

Minister for defence, equipment, support and technology, Philip Dunne, added: 'ScanEagle provides the Royal Navy with proven surveillance capability that has already been used on operations by other nations, so we know we are getting top quality equipment.

'The technology is off-the-shelf and will be available to the Royal Navy as soon as possible.

'Our continued investment in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems is essential to keeping our armed forces up to date with the latest capabilities and this will be a central part of the MoD's investment in new equipment over the next 10 years.'
