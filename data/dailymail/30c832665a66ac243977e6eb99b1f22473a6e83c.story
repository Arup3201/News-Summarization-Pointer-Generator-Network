Summer is the perfect time to get out and explore Britain's magnificent coastline - and as well as beaches, cliffs and seabirds, you'll also find plenty of great gardens.

Although strong winds and salt spray make gardening by the sea a challenge, there's a wealth of spectacular ones to visit.

Arundell in West Pentire, Cornwall describes itself as 'a garden where no garden should be'.

Britain's beaches play host to some of the world's most beautiful coastline gardens

Wedged between two beaches, this one-acre plot features a Mediterranean courtyard, a stumpery and a fernery, herbaceous borders and an exotic garden. Open 20 July, 1pm-5pm, and by appointment until August.

Another Cornish gem, Waters Edge near Coverack on the Lizard Peninsula, is a narrow, sheltered garden which leads down to a cliff top, with seats from which to enjoy the sea views.

The garden is especially beautiful in July when the blue agapanthus are in flower. Open 27 July, 11am-4pm, and by appointment in July and August.

In neighbouring Devon, Cliffe at Lee near Ilfracombe is a five-acre terraced garden with an outlook over the sea. Despite what the owners call 'wicked winds', they've created a Mediterranean area, herbaceous borders and woodland areas. Open until 12 September, 10am-4pm.

Seaside environments encourage a completely different type of garden

Sea Close in Hythe in Kent is a one-acre garden perched on a steep hill overlooking the sea with many unusual and tender plants such as crinodendron, indigofera, eucryphia and hibiscus. Open by appointment until October.

Lilac Cottage at Blitterlees in Cumbria has views across the Solway estuary to the Scottish hills beyond. The one-acre garden is divided into themed areas which include an ornamental garden, a mixed border, and a maze garden. Open by appointment until August.

Sunningdale at Bull Bay in Gwynedd is just a few steps from the sea. While the sheltered rear garden is planted in cottagey style, this is also a rugged coastal garden with cliffs, steps, wild flowers and seating to try and spot dolphins. Open by appointment in July.

The Lookout at Kilmuir near Inverness has breathtaking views over the Moray Firth and is only for sure-footed visitors. The third-of-an-acre plot has a cottage garden, a scree and rock garden, roses, bamboos, a lily pond, and a raised vegetable area. Open weekends, midday-4pm, until the end of September and by appointment to December.

Foldaway planter

The ingenious VegTrug Poppy is for anyone who wants a raised bed but is tight for space.
