Since Sir Alex Ferguson left Manchester United in 2013, his old club have been making a habit of breaking some rather unwanted records.

On Sunday, Louis van Gaal's side continued a miserable start to the 2014-15 Premier League season by surrendering a two-goal against Leicester before suffering a shock 5-3 defeat.

Not since 1984, against Brian's Clough's Nottingham Forest, have United let a two-goal lead slip as second half goals from Steve Hodge, Johnny Metgod and Gary Mills cancelled out a Gordon Strachan brace.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at what else was happening the last time the Red Devils failed to take advantage of a two-goal lead...

British group Frankie Goes to Hollywood claimed the UK chart's No 1 spot with iconic hit The Power of Love taken from the debut studio album Welcome to the Pleasuredome.

Other acts making up the UK Chart's top 10 in December 1984 included Madonna, Wham!, Shakin' Stevens and Paul McCartney before huge Christmas hit Do They Know It's Christmas by the Band Aid collective claimed the festive No 1 spot for five weeks.

The Week of December 8 also saw Eddie Murphy's film series Beverly Hills Cop begin with a blockuster release of the police detective comedy.

Elsewhere, Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister and was battling the National Union of Mineworkers.

Sir Bobby Robson was in charge of the England national team after being appointed as Three Lions boss in 1982. The former manager led England to the 1986 and 1990 World Cup finals as well as the European Championship in 1988.

Interestingly, Robin van Persie was the only player in United's starting line-up against Leicester on Sunday to have been born before 1984 while unused substitute Darren Fletcher would have been just 10 months old when Ron Atkinson's side fell to Clough's Forest. 

As things stand Van Gaal may be extremely happy to equal United's fourth-place finish at the end of the 1984-85 season.

Atkinson's United ended up fourth, 14 points behind Everton who won the First Division title with an impressive tally of 90 points.

They also won the FA Cup, beating Everton 1-0 (despite Kevin Moran becoming the first player to be sent off in the final), courtesy of a goal from Norman Whiteside
