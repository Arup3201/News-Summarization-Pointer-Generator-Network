Paralympic star Oscar Pistorius today insisted he had no intention of killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp as he gave a graphic account of the night he shot her dead, claiming he mistook her for a burglar when he woke up in the middle of the night.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel  claimed Pistorius got up from bed, put on his prosthetic legs and walked seven metres before shooting Ms Steenkamp through a closed bathroom door.

Mr Nell said it showed it was a premeditated murder, adding there was 'a motive to kill'.

But in a statement Pistorius said he woke up to a sound in the bathroom believing it was an intruder and he felt vulnerable without his prosthetics.

He said he screamed at the intruder before firing shots through a bathroom door. He then realised Miss Steenkamp was not in bed and it then dawned on him that 'it could be her in there'.

Pistorius
used a cricket bat to break open the bathroom door where she was 
slumped over in the toilet. He said she was still alive and called the 
paramedics before she died in his arms.

Pistorius went on: 'I fail to 
understand how I could be charged with murder, let alone premeditated 
murder, as I did not plan to murder my girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.'

French fashion house Thierry Mugler has become the latest high-profile sponsor to distance itself from Oscar Pistorius as the Paralympian fights murder charges in South Africa.

The company has announced the immediate and complete withdrawal of all products featuring Pistorius including its 'A*men Pure Shot' fragrance, which was launched as a special edition to mark last year's London Paralympics.

In addition, Thierry Mugler has removed all point-of-sale advertising featuring Pistorius, and deleted all references to the athlete from its website.

A Thierry Mugler spokesperson said: 'Out of respect and sympathy to the families involved in this tragic case, Thierry Mugler Parfums has removed all campaigns featuring Oscar Pistorius.'

Promotional material for 'A*Men Pure Shot' last year described it as 'a bold fragrance.. embodied by the charismatic Oscar Pistorius, chosen for his unique journey and values of excellence and achievement that he symbolises and represents.'

Two other major sponsors, Oakley and Nike, also distanced themselves from the athlete this week following his charge over the shooting death of his girlfriend.

Oakley has suspended its contract with Pistorius while Nike said it has no plans to use him in future campaigns.

British Telecom, with whom Pistorius has been involved as a brand ambassador as well as an ambassador for the BT Paralympic World Cup, issued a short statement today saying: 'Given the ongoing situation we have nothing further to say at this time.'

The couple went to sleep shortly after 10pm, Pistorius said, but in the middle of the night he woke up and thought an intruder had climbed in through his bathroom window.

He said he grabbed a 9mm pistol - which he kept under his bed after receiving death threats - and made his way in the darkness towards the bathroom door.

'As I didn't have my prosthetic legs on I was vulnerable,' he said. 'I fired a shot at the toilet door and shouted to Reeva to call the police.'

The defendant described how he was 'absolutely mortified at the death of my beloved Reeva'.

Pistorius began shaking and crying as his statement was read out, according to the South African Press Association.

The bail hearing came as Steenkamp's funeral was held in her home town of Port Elizabeth.

Magistrate Desmond Nair ruled that the case was a schedule six offence - meaning premeditated murder - for the purpose of the bail hearing in Pretoria.

Prosecutor Mr Nel told the court the victim arrived at the house between 5pm and 6pm on Wednesday, and went to the bathroom after an argument between the pair.

He said that at 3am Pistorius got up from his bed, walked to the bathroom door and fired four shots through the closed door, hitting her three times.

'She couldn't go anywhere. You can run nowhere,' Mr Nel said.

He told the court Pistorius later told a friend he thought she was a burglar.

Mr Nel said: 'It was all part of the pre-planning. Why would a burglar lock himself inside the bathroom?'

Pistorius' lawyer, Barry Roux, said Steenkamp was not murdered and there were a number of cases where men shot members of their own family through doors after mistaking them for burglars.

Oscar Pistorius passed two drugs tests during last summer's Paralympic Games in London, Sportsmail has learned.

The World Anti-Doping Agency are aware of reports that steroids and other banned substances have allegedly been found in the South African's home, but will wait for police investigations to conclude before making their own formal inquiries.

Pistorius was tested on August 25 last year, just four days before the Paralympic Games began, and again on September 8 following his victory in the T44 400 metres. Both tests came back negative.

An International Paralympic Committee (IPC) source added: 'Pistorius was a very heavily tested athlete. In addition to tests at IPC events he would also have been tested at IAAF events, as well as by South Africa's own anti-doping agency.'

He also suggested that Pistorius broke down the bathroom door after the shooting to help Steenkamp.

'We submit it is not even murder,' Mr Roux said. 'There is no concession this is a murder.'

Pistorius won two gold medals and a silver at the 2012 Paralympic Games in London. He also competed in the Olympics.

Steenkamp was cremated at a memorial service attended by family and 
friends who had travelled from around the world. Six pallbearers carried
her coffin, draped with a white cloth and covered in white flowers.

Her brother, Adam Steenkamp, said after the service: 'Everyone is sad, 
understandably, but at certain points we were smiling whilst remembering
Reeva, because we only have good memories of her."

He went on: 'There's a space missing inside all the people that she knew that cannot be filled again.

'We're going to keep all the positive things that we remember and know 
about my sister and we will try and continue with the things that she 
tried to make better. We'll miss her.'

The court hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.

Support: Pistorius's father said he had 'zero doubt' Miss Steenkamp's death was a
tragic accident
