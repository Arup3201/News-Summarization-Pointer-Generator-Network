Few holidaymakers make the effort to learn local laws before travelling abroad although most believe it would be useful to do so, according to a survey.

As many as 70% said researching local laws and customs would make their holiday more enjoyable, but fewer than half would actually make this part of their preparations, the survey by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) showed.

UK tourists can get hauled up on foreign ground for unlikely offences such as driving a dirty car in Russia, wearing camouflage clothing in Barbados and jaywalking in the US.

Other offences include entering a church or mosque with arms and legs uncovered in Italy or Turkey and leaving the beach in swimwear in Majorca or Barcelona.

The FCO survey of 1,000 people also listed new local laws that have been introduced abroad this year.

New laws abroad for 2014 include:

New no nos as of 2014: Driving a dirty car in Russia and taking e-cigarettes into the United Arab Emirates

FCO Minister Mark Simmonds said: 'It's easy to throw caution to the wind when on holiday but it's important to be aware of the local laws and customs before you set off. 

'We want people to enjoy their holidays so we encourage them to be prepared.

'Laws and customs vary widely from country to country and visitors should respect them to avoid causing offence or even being arrested. 

'Spending five minutes reading our travel advice may save travellers a lot of time in the long run.'
