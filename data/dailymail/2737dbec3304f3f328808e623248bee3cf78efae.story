Previously unseen sketches of costumes designed for the first three Star Wars films are being revealed for the first time in a new book.

Drawings and illustrations for a number of the film's key characters are shown in the book, called Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy.

More than 200 costume photographs, sketches and behind-the-scenes photos and notes are documented after the author was given the go ahead to delve into the Lucasfilm vaults.

The archive includes an early concept for R2-D2 created by Ralph McQuarrie in 1975 which depicted the robot operating on a single ball (left). But the idea proved impractical and appeared in a different format on film (right)

Included in the treasure trove of material are early ideas for costumes for much-loved characters like Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi, R2-D2 and Yoda.

The book was written by Brandon Alinger, chief operations officer of the Los Angeles branch of the Prop Store of London - a major player in the movie props and costumes industry.

Star Wars fans can look forward to original artwork, interviews with costume makers and behind-the-scenes photographs linked to episodes IV, V and VI.

Early drawings of Yoda, including the one above left created in 1978, stood the test of time. The character has similar attributes in the 2005 Star Wars film, Episode III: Revenge of the Sith

A concept costume for Obi-Wan Kenobi (left), created by designer John Mollo in 1976, is also shown in the book. Sir Alec Guinness played the character in the first Star Wars film in 1977 (right)

The archive includes an early concept for R2-D2 created by Ralph McQuarrie in 1975 which depicted the robot operating on a single ball. But the idea proved impractical and it never made it to film.

It also includes designs for Princess Leia as a slave dancer drawn up in 1981 by Nilo Rodis-Jamero who served as the assistant art director and concept artist on the original trilogy.

A concept costume for Obi-Wan Kenobi, created by designer John Mollo in 1976, is also shown in the book along with his illustrations for the Jawa costume in the same year.

The book, released in October, also includes designs for Princess Leia (left) as a slave dancer drawn up in 1981 by Nilo Rodis-Jamero. The character was played by Carrie Fisher (pictured with co-actor Mark Hamill in Return of the Jedi)

This early Ewok illustration created in 1981, shows a version whose width equaled its height. The images are to be revealed in a book called Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy

Early drawings of Yoda, including one created in 1978, stood the test of time with the film character instantly recognisable from the sketches - even in later episodes.

Publishers Titan, have described the book - released in October - as an 'extremely rare and exciting opportunity to delve into the Lucasfilm vaults, revealing previously unseen sketches, stories and much more.'

A spokesman said: 'It combines all-new photography with original artwork, exclusive behind-the-scenes images, new research, and new interviews with the costume designers, stitchers and dressers.'
