Virgin Australia's cabin stewards have been ordered to be less sexy in a company revamp aimed to win over business flyers from bitter rival Qantas.

Bosses of the airline, formally known as Virgin Blue, believe cabin crew have become too casual with customers and want to inject a more sophisticated air.

The edict is among a raft of changes that include etiquette classes and a ban on using the traditional Aussie greeting 'mate' without written permission.

The cabin crew of Virgin Australia have been asked to participate in a program called Elevate, an etiquette, wine-appreciation, grooming and body language class

A source, who asked not to be named, told Australia's Herald Sun: 'They want us to get away from that 'sex' look that's been attached to the company.'

The overhaul is a far cry from the casual, almost cheeky attitude staff 
adopted after the airline was founded in 2000 by Sir Richard Branson.

Last year the company - then Virgin Blue - even employed supermodel Elle Macpherson to lead 60 employees in a glamorous catwalk show to showcase their new sis-inspired uniforms.

Big change: Virgin Atlantic's charismatic boss Richard Branson

All staff will undergo rigorous lessons in wine tasting, grooming and body language and will only be permitted to use the term 'mate' with frequent flyers who have given their consent on the airline's database.

Virgin Australia's group executive of brand and customer experience, Mark Hassell, has also decided to smarten up the airline's Melbourne Airport lounge, replacing the pool table with baristas and a buffet.

Hassell said: 'We are not creating clones and we are not creating straightjackets for people.

'We want to retain of the spirit that 
exists within Virgin service style and service behavior but put it in a 
context that is equally relevant for business-purpose and corporate 
travelers.'

The move follows a decision earlier this year to give flight attendants whispering lessons to have a 
'calming effect' for Upper Class passengers.

'It
is incredibly important that all Virgin Atlantic's cabin crew have 
their skills honed in order to provide the most comfortable experience 
possible for our passengers,' Richard Fitzgerald, Virgin Atlantic's 
whispering coach, said at the time.
