After one too many bad cups of tea, a clever inventor has designed a nifty little gadget that promises to deliver the perfect cuppa every time.

At seven inches long and two inches wide, the 15-ounce gizmo, which costs $29 (£19), has a built-in mechanism - modelled on an egg timer - which beeps to let you know when your tea is brewed.

The device is the brainchild of Lennart Rieper, who is currently raising funds on crowdfunding website Kickstarter to bring his smart infusion device to fruition.

Tealightful Timer: The clever gizmo is the invention of German designer Lennert Rieper. It has a built-in mechanism - modelled on an egg timer -  which beeps to let you know when your tea is brewed

The Tealightful Timer, which can be loaded up with tea leaves, will automatically stop the steeping process at the right time, so your cuppa isn’t brewed too bitter or strong.

The German native, who studied industrial design in his homeland as well as in the US, has worked with international designers on various products but this is his first sole creation. 

His device works on the same mechanics as an egg timer.

Consisting of four parts – two sections at the top and two at the bottom –the inner top part of the infuser holds the timer mechanism and is held securely by the outer top section.

The inner bottom section holds the tea bag or leaves - which will be infused in the water - while the outer bottom section acts as a sealant, preventing the leaves from leaking out.

The timers come in a variety of shades. They all measure seven inches long and two inches wide

The bottom section comes in two parts (left). Tea leaves are placed in the inner bowl of the bottom section 

All you have to do to make a perfect cup of tea is fill the timer with leaves or a tea bag.

Then close the infuser and wind up the mechanism, first setting the preferred time, before dropping it into the water.

Your tea will now steep for as many minutes as you want it to before the brewing process stops automatically and the timer beeps to alert you that its job is done. 

The timer is designed to fit in a variety of cups and glasses and will hold loose leaves, herbal infusions and tea bags.

Mr Rieper needs to raise $40,000 (£26,000) by 1 February to start production. His crowdfunding page has currently raised $9,157 (£6,000). 

The infuser can hold tea bags or tea leaves. The device is estimated to go into production in February 

The end to over-brewed tea? Simply screw in the bottom bowl firmly and set your timer (left) before placing it in a mug of hot water for the steeping process to begin (right)

The device also comes on its own, without a timer for those who are already able to brew the perfect cuppa.

'The biggest challenge in the past was the mechanic inside the timer that had to be 100 per cent waterproof,' Mr Rieper writes on his Kickstarter page. 

'Within a team of experienced mechanical engineers we found several solutions, and I am proud that we don't have to use any electronics to set the timer.

'As of now we have decided on a mechanic that is very similar to the one used by egg timers - inexpensive and simple to manufacture.

'[The] second biggest challenge is to find out how many times this campaign is being backed and therefore how many Tealightful Timers have to be made.

'Depending on the quantity we then have to choose which manufacturer will be the right one to produce the parts.'
