The Duchess of Cambridge was seen taking a solitary walk in the Swiss mountains earlier today, shortly after enjoying a post-celebratory brunch following yesterday’s wedding of friends the Royal family.

Carrying her black jacket on her arm she wore a loose-fitting spotted top which revealed a hint of her blossoming baby bump.

While the Duchess opted for a walk in the sunshine, her husband Prince William and his brother Harry were skiing with friends in another part of the resort.

Accompanied by three royal protection officers, the Duchess enjoyed the sun at the Arosa resort where she, her husband and brother-in-law were guests at yesterday’s wedding of London 2012 dressage champion Laura Bechtolsheimer and polo player Mark Tomlinson.

She teamed the outfit with black skinny jeans and furry black snow boots, similar to the designer £300 Mukluk boots that Prince Harry bought girlfriend Cressida Bonas during their recent holiday in Verbier last month. The Duchess was also wearing a pair of £159 Givenchy sunglasses.

A tourist from Germany, who was walking with his wife, said: ‘She was walking down the hill with three men. She was very sweet and smiled at people who looked at her. She seemed to be taking in the scenery.’

Not far from the Duchess’s hiking trail, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry were spotted skiing with friends around the same time.

Prince William wore a sensible black helmet and goggles, while his younger brother went for an outlandish shiny red jacket teamed with a dark-blue woolly hat and reflective sunglasses.

At one point, both brothers stopped on the slopes to embrace two blonde female friends. Prince Harry appeared to slip as he did so and had to throw his ski poles out to his side to steady himself.

Kate and Prince William, who was an usher at the wedding of close friend Mark Tomlinson and Laura Bechtolsheimer , stayed at the five-star hotel owned by the bride’s billionaire grandfather, where the reception was held on Saturday.

Suites at the Tschuggen Grand Hotel cost up to £2,450-a-night and include use of a private 12-seat ski lift to whisk people straight up to the slopes.

Guests found skis, poles and ski passes in their rooms – while a traditional wooden toboggan was provided for the pregnant Duchess.

While Prince William and Harry went skiing on Friday, Kate - usually a keen skier herself - picked the relatively safer option of sledging with a friend and her baby.

Locals said she laughed out loud as she sped down a one-kilometre-long winding slope on the side of the stunning Graubünden mountains.

A Swiss skier told the Mail: ‘She tucked her legs up and just went. I thought it was very brave for a pregnant woman, because it was on quite an incline.

‘She looked like she was having a good time and was smiling and laughing all the way down. It seemed she was always smiling.’

The Duchess wrapped up warm in Mukluk-style boots and a dark-brown sheepskin £745 L.K. Bennett jacket, which she usually wears to walk her puppy, Lupo, in Hyde Park.

After sledging, she met the 235-strong wedding party for a pre-wedding meal on the terrace of a mountain-top restaurant, where they ate the traditional dish of raclette.

Onlookers said that, while many of the group drank copious amounts of red and white wine, she stuck to sparkling apple juice.

The bride’s grandparents are understood to have picked up the £13,400 bill.

On the slopes: Kate kept warm in black trousers and comfy boots and wore a snug looking brown jacket. She also wore shades in the bright winter sun

Miss Bechtolsheimer, 28, who won a 
gold and bronze medal in dressage at the London 2012 Olympics, is the 
granddaughter of the German billionaire property magnate Karl-Heinz 
Kipp, 88, who founded the Massa chain of department stores.

Mr
Kipp, who owns four luxury hotels in Switzerland, including the 
Tschuggen, gave the bridal party exclusive use of the hotel, which 
boasts five restaurants and two bars, an indoor and outdoor pool and a 
luxury spa.

William 
travelled with the other groomsmen to the wedding in a black Mercedes, 
while his wife and brother travelled with other guests in a cheerful 
blue bus with pictures of flowers and a sun painted on the side.

Prince
Harry did not bring his new girlfriend, dance student Cressida Bonas, 
24, whom he holidayed with in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier last 
month.

Corinne Denzler, a 
manager at the Tschuggen hotel, said: ‘The royals were lovely and were 
just like normal guests. They did not want any special treatment.’

At
the lavish hotel reception, guests enjoyed a seven-course meal of 
dishes including lobster salad, veal steak and chocolate and raspberry 
mousse.

Guests were then invited to use a pastel-coloured merry-go-round which had been specially installed in the hotel grounds.

The Duke and Duchess and Prince Harry then partied until late into the night with fellow guests.

One said: ‘It was a pretty wild night. Everyone was dancing, including the royals.

‘It went on until the early hours of the morning. At about 6am, one guy even took his clothes off streaked across the balcony.’

Another
source said: ‘Let’s just say it was a good party. No one retired before
midnight.’ The next morning, to ease their weary heads, guests enjoyed a
brunch cooked by Michelin-star chef Tobias Jochim.

The
Duchess is understood to have left the snow-capped mountains on Sunday 
evening to fly back to England in time for a royal engagement in Grimsby
on Tuesday where she will visit the town’s fishing heritage centre, a 
school and Humberside Fire and Rescue.
