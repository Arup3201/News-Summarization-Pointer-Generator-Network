This is the sickening moment a violent woman kicked her dog so hard that it flew into the air, through a set of railings and into an adjacent car park.

Hannah Bennett, 35, of Bovington, Dorset, was captured on CCTV booting Mace the Staffordshire bull terrier outside a shop - while stunned witnesses watched in disbelief.

Despite being confronted by members of the pubic, Bennett then continued to pull and drag the shaken and injured animal, until eventually, someone was able to release her grip on its collar.

After being notified of the incident, the RSPCA and police watched the shocking footage and Bennett is now banned from owning animals for five years.

Admitting that she caused unnecessary suffering to the pooch - she was also hit with an £80 surcharge and a two-week custodial sentence, suspended for one year, at Weymouth Magistrates' Court today.

In the clip, Bennett is carrying a shopping bag and is seen turning to say something to her pet before swinging back her right leg and brutally kicking him.

Mace was taken to the vets where they discovered the 13-year-old had tenderness to his abdomen and blood in his urine.

He recovered after ten days and was later signed over to the RSPCA, where he remains.

RSPCA inspector Graham Hammond said: 'Mace clearly trusted his owner and she abused this trust when she kicked him.

'No animal should have to suffer at the hands of its owner as they are the one person in the world who should be caring for that animal.'
