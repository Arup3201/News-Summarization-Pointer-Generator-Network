For most of us 'liking' a status or 'sharing' a picture can seem like completely natural acts, but would they make any sense when taken out of context? 

A YouTube video blogger, Jena Kingsley, took to the streets of New York to see what  reaction she would receive if she used online lingo in day to day life.

Her video, which captures her approaching strangers to poke, like and view them, has been viewed 90,000 times.

Jena Kingsley put social networking to the test in real life, taking to the streets of NYC with a personal update

Reenacting page views on LinkedIn, Jena informs a subway passenger how many 'views' he has had 

The comedian begins the video, which she created with Relationship Science's Mine app, by explaining the intention behind the film.

She said: 'Social networking is completely out of control these days but do the things we do online make sense in real life?' 

The film swiftly moves on to Jena stalking a woman before tapping her on the shoulder and calling out to her. 

'Mam, I just want to let you know that I'm following you. Just giving you an alert' says Jenna, referring to the act of 'following' someone on Twitter. 

Unsurprisingly the woman looks a little confused before mumbling 'okay', but Jena keeps up the act saying: 'You don't have to do anything. Just know it and enjoy it.'

Jena continues to 'follow' several people on the street telling one bewildered woman: 'Jena Kingsley is now following you, just do whatever and I will just watch.'

At Grand Central station she announced that she had 'checked in', a way of updating location on Facebook

The film switches to the vlogger prodding a man in a blue jacket. 'You want to poke me back?' she asks him and he obliges. 'Isn't that fun?' she says.

Her fellow 'poker' doesn't seem as sure, 'Yeah, it's just weird though I don't even know you,' he points out.

'I know but that's what you do right?' she responds after re-enacting the Facebook action of using the poke button to contact a friend. 

Jena continues the Facebook theme, this time by providing passers-by with a notification of a friend's change of job. 

Jenna makes connections much like on LinkedIn using  the man sitting next to her

Using a megaphone Jena announces: 'Tom O'Donnell started working at McGuire law firm,' before asking pedestrians to 'comment' on the update.

The comedian then decides to see how the characteristics of the professional network LinkedIn would work in a actual social situation.

She approaches a man who is adding sugar to his beverage and compliments him on his technique before adding: 'I want to endorse you for your coffee-making skills' she tells him.

She continues to endorse several other customers before asking another if she would like to endorse her back.  

At this point Jena decides to send out a few friend requests, which users of Facebook will be familiar with, this is the action of inviting another user to connect with you.

Jena Kingsley teamed up with Relationship Science to see if social networking behaviour can work in real life

She approaches a table where two men are siting and says: 'Hi guys I was wondering if you would accept my friendship request?'

When they just look at her blankly Jena decides to change her approach and see if they would rather be connected in a business sense as done on LinkedIn.  

'He looks really important with, like, the whole button-down,' Jena says to one of the men, adding, 'do you want to be connected?'

Jena then takes the professional network to the New York subway letting travellers know just how many 'views' their 'profile' has received.

'I just want to let you know that 12 people have viewed you,' she tells one of the passengers. 

'What does that mean?' asks a bewildered woman.

'I don't know, you must be really important they're like viewing you. That guy chose to remain anonymous,' explains Jena. 

Next up Jena takes to the busy Grand Central station to play out some popular Facebook interactions. 

'I have just checked into Grand Central station,' she screams, before grabbing a stranger and asking his name before repeating 'Jenna and Andrew have just checked into Grand Central station with about 452 other people,' referencing the popular craze of listing your location. 

Jena asked people to comment on something before telling them she 'liked' it, a common Facebook action

One of the few actions that Jena recreates that actually does seem to make some sense in a social situation is the act of sharing, whereby users can re-post something they have found amusing.

A woman with a small dog walks by and Jena stops her: 'Oh my God, mam, that is so cute, I have to share this with everybody.' 

This seems to encourage the most normal reaction.

'Do you want to comment on how cute this is?' she asks one elderly woman who agrees. 

'This is cute,' she says while Jena gives her the thumbs-up and tells her, 'I like your comment.'  

The final part of the video sees the act of making connections online, something that can be done through having mutual connections on LinkedIn, allowing users to make even more connections. 

'Excuse me sir, can you introduce me to that guy who's sitting next to you?' Jena asks her neighbour in a shoe-shining booth. 

The man to her left, is completely bemused but introduces the pair before Jena explains why she thought they ought to meet.

'We had him in common so I figured I should meet you. And now we're all connected.'
