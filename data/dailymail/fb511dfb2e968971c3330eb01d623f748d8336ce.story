A photograph uncovered among records from World War I shows a fresh-faced soldier taking a picture of himself in front of a bedroom mirror.

Just months later, the 21-year-old soldier was shot down during an air battle over Germany along with a comrade from No 4. Squadron.

His story, and haunting photo, has been released ahead of Remembrance Day next week, and to commemorate 2014 as the 100-year anniversary since the start of the Great War.

This image was taken by Australian soldier Thomas Baker in 1918 while fighting in Europe. Mr Baker joined the war effort in France in July 1916 before training to be a pilot and becoming a flight commander for No.4 squadron at the age of 20. He died in a battle over Germany on 4 November 1918 aged just 21

The photo was taken by Australian soldier Thomas Baker who arrived in France on 1 July 1916 at the age of 19.

He was involved in the campaign to fight on the Somme and won the Military Medal near Gueudecourt on 11 December that year for repairing a telephone line in thirty separate places under intense enemy fire.

A year later, he added a Bar to his military medal after putting out a fire in an ammunition store under constant artillery fire. 

Records reveal he was particularly praised because his quick actions prevented 'certain disaster'.

Mr Baker was the eldest son of schoolmaster and farmer Richmond Baker, and his wife Annie Martha from Smithfield, South Australia,

He joined the 11th Royal Australian Engineers of the Citizens Military Force on 29 July 1915 and began the war as a reinforcement gunner to the 6th Field Artillery Brigade.

At the age of 19, Mr Baker arrived in France on 1 July 1916 and took part in the Somme offensive.

He won the Military Medal near Gueudecourt on 11 December 1916 for repairing a telephone line in thirty separate places under intense enemy fire.

In September 1917, Baker joined the Australian Flying Corps and applied to become an air mechanic. He was instead selected to become a pilot and was posted for flight training.

He was promoted to temporary captain and made a flight commander in No. 4 Squadron on 24 October.

On 4 November 1918, the whole of No. 80 Wing RAF - of which No. 4 Squadron was part - took to the sky in an effort to 'harass the German retreat on the Leuze-Ath road' and to bomb the aerodrome to the east of Leuze.

Mr Baker led a formation of 'Sopwith Snipes' that had been chosen as a bomber escort when the initial raid was carried out. 

The battle raged for two or three minutes before dying out. As the Snipes re-grouped, they discovered that two pilots were missing.

Mr Baker and fellow ace Lieutenant Arthur Palliser were initially recorded as missing, but were later found to have fallen victim to German ace, Karl 'Rittmeister' Bolle.

The 21-year-old was credited with 12 victories, including seven aircraft and one balloon destroyed with an additional four planes driven down out of control.

He was No. 4 Squadron's fourth highest scoring ace and on 8 February 1919, the London Gazette carried the posthumous announcement of the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Thomas Baker. 

Towards the end of WWI, Mr Baker joined the Australian Flying Corps and applied to become an air mechanic.

He was instead selected to become a pilot and was posted for flight training, graduating on 27 March.

On 16 August he participated in the largest Ariel attack of the war and was promoted to temporary captain and flight commander in No. 4 Squadron on 24 October.

On 4 November 1918, the whole of No. 80 Wing RAF - of which No. 4 Squadron was part - took to the sky in an effort to 'harass the German retreat on the Leuze-Ath road' and to bomb the aerodrome to the east of Leuze.

Mr Baker's Grave Registration Report (GRR) is pictured. It details the name, rank and date of death of Mr Baker and fellow RAF member Lieutenant J.G Leckenby who died at the age of 18. Both servicemen were buried in the Escanaggled Communal Cemetery in Belgium

Gunner Baker is pictured about to board a train from South Australia to Victoria for military training in 1915. He won the Military Medal on 11 December 1916 for repairing a telephone line in thirty separate places under intense enemy fire. He was also credited with 12 victories during his time as a pilot and flight commander

Mr Baker led a formation of 'Sopwith Snipes' from No. 4 Squadron that had been chosen as a bomber escort when the initial raid was carried out,

The squadron was intercepted by a patrol of 12 'Fokkers' and the battle raged for two or three minutes before dying out.

As the Snipes re-grouped, they discovered two pilots were missing, including Mr Baker.

Mr Baker's story was released by London-based genealogy website Findmypast to commemorate next week's Remembrance Day.

It was shortly before Mr Baker left for this battle that he captured the 'selfie' in a mirror in his room.

Findmypast has more than 26 million WWI records and is opening its collection up, as well as its other historical records, for free this weekend.

Findmypast's military expert Paul Nixon told MailOnline: 'The WWI was a pivotal moment for society and it is no surprise that this Remembrance Day is particularly poignant.

'Sadly no-one is now alive who fought in the WWI, and so we hope that by opening up our billions of records more people across the UK will be able to discover the history of their ancestors.'
