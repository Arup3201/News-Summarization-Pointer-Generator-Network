A 22-year-old man linked to the hacking group that claimed responsibility for a Christmas Day attack on Sony and Microsoft was arrested today by police investigating PayPal thefts.

Vincent Omari has been linked to the Lizard Squad hacking group that took credit for attacks on Sony’s PlayStation Network and Microsoft’s Xbox Live gaming networks over Christmas.

The man, from Twickenham, south-west London, was arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of fraud by false representation and Computer Misuse Act offences - and has since been bailed to March 10.

Omari, who is a student of network security and ethical hacking, has said he is simply a spokesman for Lizard Squad - and denies having any part in the attack on Sony and Microsoft.

A spokesman for the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit, speaking via Thames Valley Police, said the arrest was in connection with an ‘ongoing investigation in to cyber fraud offences’.

These were said to have taken place between 2013 and August 2014, during which time alleged

Omani confirmed to MailOnline in an email tonight:‎ 'I'm on bail'. He added that he does not have a court date, contrary to reports in other publications.  

Sony said earlier this week that its PlayStation Network was back online after three days of disruptions, although it warned heavy traffic might continue to cause problems for customers.

The Lizard Squad group - or someone claiming to speak for it - took credit for the disruptions. The Xbox service, which also went down on Christmas Day, was back online last Friday.

The shutdown prompted angry parents to say that Christmas had been ruined for thousands of children who received the consoles as presents. 

The group disabled the Playstation and Xbox networks by flooding them with information, which means that normal users cannot gain access.

But there is no evidence to link these episodes with a recent attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation blamed that attack on North Korea, which was furious about Sony's ‘The Interview’, a comedy about a plot to assassinate the country’s leader Kim Jong Un.

Lizard Squad is a network of hackers which bears striking similarities to the online anarchist collective Anonymous and is described as ‘vocal, taunting and bit obnoxious’.

The group seeks to cause mayhem online ‘for a laugh’ and has called itself the ‘next generation Grinch’ after the children’s character that hates Christmas, often using Twitter to boast of upcoming attacks.

Some reports say it mainly operates from Russia but others believe it is more likely to be made up of underground networks of hackers from around the world, communicating using the ‘dark web’.

Lizard Squad has a history of targeting computer game companies, particularly Sony. 

In August it sent a bomb threat to Sony chief executive John Smedley, the same month in which it attacked Playstation just to cause ‘havoc’.

Dan Holden, of online security company Arbor Networks, said: ‘If they’re coming after you, you’re going to have a bad day.’
