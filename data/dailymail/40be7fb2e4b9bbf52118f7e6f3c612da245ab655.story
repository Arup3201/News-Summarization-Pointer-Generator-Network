There are many occupational hazards associated with working as a reporter - being yelled at, sued and the occasional death threat. 

Being carjacked usually isn't one of them.

But such was the case at the weekend for Florida news reporter Josh Taylor, who was investigating an alleged property fraud in Sarasota.

Taylor, who has worked at ABC for over ten years, was looking into a complaint made a 91-year-old woman who had rented a large home in Siesta Key for a family reunion that had been listed as having 11 bedrooms and being able to sleep 25 to 30 people.

However the house has code violations and only has five bedrooms, according to ABC 7.

With a listed price of $4500-a-week, the woman asked for her deposit refunded but was refused.

Taylor was setting up his camera outside the house on Friday in an attempt to speak to the owner when he was approached by a woman, who came running from the property.

With the camera rolling, the woman, identified by officials as Jean Price, put her hand over the lens and demanded he leave.

'You're going to leave!' Price can be seen yelling in the footage.

When Taylor tells her it is a public road and he has a right to be there, Price picks up his tripod and packs it inside his ABC car.

'Ok, I'll just drive you f---ing car,' Price then says.

She then gets inside the vehicle and drives down the street.

The car was left here, in a neighboring, with the keys inside

Price parked the car in another street nearby, leaving the keys inside.

Taylor called the County Sheriff's Office, who will now charge Price with grand theft auto.

A neighbor told ABC 7 that Price works for the man who owns the hom, a local chiropractor named Dr. Craig Siegal.

Neither he or Price have commented on the incident.

Taylor said that in his 12 years of reporting, he has never been carjacked.
