A woman in Indiana found her biological mother in just 12 hours after publicizing her search on Facebook.

She's always been happy with her adoptive family, but she couldn't help being curious about who her biological mother was, and if she ever thought about her.

Then and now: Whitney was always happy with her adoptive parents (pictured on the left with her adoptive father Andy Brock), but she was curious about what happened to her biological family

On August 28 she decided to enlist the help of social media in her quest to track down her mom.

She posted a picture of herself holding a sign with all the details she knew about her birth and her biological mother.

She wrote what day she was born and at what hospital and that her mother's name was Jennifer Moorhead.

Please share: On August 28, Whitney took to Facebook to spread the word about her search for her biological family

'I knew I probably shouldn't get my hopes up, but I just couldn't help refreshing my page to see how many shares I was getting, or if any emails were coming through yet,' Whitney wrote on Facebook.

The post was shared over 3,600 times and eventually a woman in Florida sent her a list of possible phone numbers for her biological mother.

The next morning at 8am Whitney called the first number on the list and a woman answered.

'I said I know this sounds crazy, but is there any way you put a baby up for adoption in 1991. And she said, on February 6th? I said yes, and she said is this Whitney Brock? I said yes. She said hi Whitney. I'm your mother,' Whitney told 14 News.

Coincidentally her biological mother was looking at Whitney's Facebook post when the phone rang. She says she started to cry she was so happy that her daughter decided to reach out to her.

'It's like winning the lottery. Better than winning the lottery,' Moorhead said.

The following week the two met up for a meal at an Amish buffet. and they were shocked to see how much they had in common.

Moorhead said she couldn't believe how much Whitney looked like her, and how she even walked like her.

'Just listening to her speak, the phrases she uses, like, it reminds me of things I would say,' Whitney said.

Whitney's adoptive mother Teresa says she looks forward to getting to know 'the other side of the family'.

She says she's glad Whitney has been able to meet her birth mother: 'I know it's something she's always wanted.'

Whitney still can't believe how lucky she was to finally find her.

'Never did I imagine that I would be able to find her so quickly! I wish I could personally thank every single person that shared my picture.'
