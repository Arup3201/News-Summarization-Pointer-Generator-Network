A bank adviser and her fiance stole £123,000 from a customer's account after they claimed fraudsters had threatened to reveal compromising photos in the run up to their wedding, a court heard. 

Anisyah Ali, 25, who was working at Halifax's North Finchley branch in north London, passed confidential details to fiance Salim Hussain, 29, and used the money to buy cars and jewellery.

The Old Bailey heard that by the time customer Julian Masters spotted the transactions, £123,000 had been approved, while the bank had declined another £114,000.

Aniysah Ali, pictured arriving at the Old Bailey, was working at a Halifax branch in north London when she allegedly used her powers as a personal banker to take the details of a customer and spend £123,000

Ali was allegedly able to use her position as a personal banker to remove blocks on the account when the bank became suspicious of unusual spending activity. 

The couple changed his address and used his personal details to order a new debit card and PIN number and Ali quit her £16,500 job the day before she was arrested on 30 May 2012.

She initially made no comment, but in a prepared statement later told police her husband-to-be had been threatened by a man known as Raza Shah and co-defendant, 28-year-old Zain Hussain.

Prosecutor David Hughes told the court: 'She said prior to the offending her husband had been subjected to a campaign of harassment by way of threats to his mobile phone.

'She also stated that Shah threatened to reveal compromising photos of her to her family.'

However, there is no evidence to back up her claims, the court heard, and Mr Hughes added that Shah, real name Alexander Saeed, was not standing trial after admitting fraud.

Mr Hughes continued: 'It is the Crown's case that the role of Anisyah Ali is absolutely vital. She was a pivotal figure. The fraud could not have been carried out without the involvement of Ms Ali.

'She used and abused her position to access the account, obtain the necessary information to change the account owner's address to another one connected to the fraudsters and enabled the obtaining of the debit card used to carry out fraudulent transactions in a variety of locations on many occasions.'

Co-defendant Zain Hussain, 28, denies fraud by false representation at the Old Bailey

The court heard how, on April 16, 2012, Ali accessed Mr Masters' account while in a private interview room at the bank.

She changed the address on the account to one in Southall, west London, and ordered a new debit card and PIN number destined to fall into the hands of the fraudsters, the jury was told.

The card was blocked on a number of occasions between April 21, and May 5, 2012 because of the unusual spending pattern on the account.

Mr Hughes said: 'The information she was able to get from the account enabled those carrying out the fraud to telephone the bank to have the card reinstated.'

Ali was arrested on 30 May 2012 at the bank's Wembley branch and receipts found in her handbag revealed cash deposits made to her Barclays account totaling more than £1,300.

At her Southall home, which she shared with Salim Hussain, more receipts were recovered, including ones from a local jewellery shop.

Checks at the shop revealed a forged utility bill had been used in conjunction with the debit card to make fraudulent purchases, the jury heard.

Ali, Hussain and co-defendant Zain Hussain deny the claims while another defendant, Alexander Saeed, admitted fraud and is not standing trial at the Old Bailey (pictured), which continues

Other successful transactions included the purchase of two cars, for £7,950 and £6,900.

Ali and Salim, both of Southall, and Zain Hussain, of Hounslow, west London, all deny fraud by false representation.

Ali also denies fraud by abuse of position between 27 March 2012 and 30 May 2012.

The trial continues.
