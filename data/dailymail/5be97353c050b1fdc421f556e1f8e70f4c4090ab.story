Appeal court judges have allowed a rapist who attacked a lesbian after a Halloween party to walk free because they do not want to interfere with his suspended sentence

The 28 year old from Portsmouth preyed on his victim after watching 'A Clockwork Orange' - even though he knew she had no interest in men.

The woman was left deeply traumatised by the attack, but Appeal Court judges have today refused to jail the attacker, describing his case as 'exceptional'.

The Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC, had referred the case  on the basis that the suspended two year prison sentence imposed at Portsmouth Crown Court in October was unduly lenient.

But today, while a panel of three judges headed by Lord Justice Pitchford agreed with that view, they said they did not consider it to be in the public interest that it should be changed.

They heard that the man, who has Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, had reported the rape to police himself - and if he had not, it would never have come to light.

The man committed the offence after a Halloween party when a friend who he knew had no sexual interest in men, invited him to share her bed- which they had done before - purely to sleep.

The court heard neither of them anticipated or intended sexual activity but during the night the man began touching her.

The 'obsessive part' of his personality took over and, despite her struggles, he had sex with the woman.

When he came to his senses and stopped he apologised profusely, 'punched himself in remorse' and left, while the woman, who made it clear their friendship was ruined, decided she did not want to report the matter to the police.

Two years later, distressed and still feeling guilty, he went to the police, saying he wanted to confess to a sexual assault and that he thought he needed help.

The man was handed a suspended two year prison sentence at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) in October

The man pleaded guilty to the rape at Portsmouth Crown Court and was handed a suspended two-year jail term in October last year.

Lawyers representing the attorney general told the Appeal Court the sentence was far too soft.

Lord Justice Pitchford agreed a suspended sentence was 'unduly lenient' - but said it would be wrong to lock him up now.

He said the man suffered from a litany of mental health problems and both he and his victim were 'vulnerable'.

The judge, sitting with Mrs Justice Swift and Judge Paul Batty QC, ruled it was 'not in the public interest' to put him behind bars. 

What he had done 'caused him distress and an enduring sense of guilt', said the judge. 

Jocelyn Ledward, for the Attorney General, argued that the man should have been jailed.

But Lord Justice Pitchford described it as 'an exceptionally sensitive and difficult' case.

He said for all his remorse, there was no doubt that he had done 'a grave wrong' with serious consequences for his victim.

Lord Pitchford said that the man had made a fully committed start to his suspended sentence order and had proved himself highly and genuinely motivated to make progress.

He said a rupture of current arrangements could only make more certain serious deterioration in his condition, and put at risk a successful outcome.

He said: 'What sets this case apart is the distress the offender himself suffers from unwelcome thoughts, his feelings of guilt and fear of catastrophe, and his almost inevitable mental deterioration if required to serve a sentence of imprisonment.' 

'There is no statutory standard of exceptionality that must be reached before a court suspends a sentence of imprisonment.

'It is a matter for the court's judgment, usually determined by weighing up the seriousness of the offence, the offender's antecedents and his personal circumstances.

'However, for an offence as serious as rape, a suspended sentence order is, as the recorder acknowledged, almost unheard of.' 

He concluded that the man was now responding well to professional help with his mental health problems.

That was the best means of reducing his risk to the public and jailing him, the judge concluded, would not be in the public interest.
