A judge has ruled that the 9-year-old boy who hopped a flight from Minneapolis to Las Vegas last month will remain away from his home for now so he can undergo additional assessments.

Judge Joseph Klein agreed with Hennepin County human services officials and attorneys for the boy's relatives by deciding that it would be best for the boy to remain in outside custody while a second psychological and neurological assessment is done.

'The child is making some progress in his placement,' Assistant Hennepin County Senior Attorney Cory Carlson told Klein at a brief hearing about a child protection petition.

Heartbreak: At a press conference this afternoon, the father, pictured, with a black hoodie and baseball cap pulled down over his face, said the family were 'heartbroken' when they learned what their son had done

In early October, the boy eluded 
airport security and stowed away on a flight from Minneapolis to Las 
Vegas. He was returned to Minneapolis.

The
boy- who has not been identified due to his age- wasn't in the 
courtroom but his attorney objected to an assessment done on the boy, 
prompting the second evaluation, the Star Tribune reported.

Last
month, the court ordered individual and family therapy while the boy's 
mother and father receive parenting training and evaluations.

Both parents are allowed to visit and call their son.

The boy's mother, who has legal custody, also is working with his school to have him assessed for special education services.

'She's done everything that has been asked of her,' said attorney Bob Paule, who represented the boy's mother.

'This has been a very difficult time for her with her son out of the home.'

The next hearing will be December 20.

The
boy's father previously spoke out when the story of his stowaway son 
broke, saying that he had been pleading with officials to help him due 
to his son's history of disruptive behavior.

'I've
been asking for help... Somebody please help me. Please,' the father 
said, his shoulders shaking and his sobs clearly audible under his 
hoodie. The man said authorities refused to help with the child's 
behavioral problems because he was a minor.

String of dramas: The truck incident happened just two days before the boy boarded the flight to Las Vegas

The 9-year-old went to take out the 
trash and when he didn't return, the father assumed he had gone to a 
friend's house. 'I'm a parent. I'm not perfect,' he said.

V.J.
Smith of 
anti-violence group MAD DADS sat next to the distraught father during 
the emotionally charged briefing and read a statement from the boy's 
mother.

'I love my son, I 
miss my son. I want my son home,' the mother said in the statement. 'I 
feel people are pushing me about what my son did.'

Smith
went on to say that the mother 'realizes he's done some things that are
wrong but she doesn't want to see her son hurt and she has been asking 
for help with her son but no one was willing to help.'

Smith
said the latest incident - which has made international news headlines -
will see the child get the help he needs, adding that he and the 
parents had already been in contact with their county's social services 
programs.
