The two pilots at the helm of the missing Malaysia Airlines passenger jet which vanished a week ago with 239 people on board are being investigated amid fears the plane was hijacked.

Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, and Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, are the subject of a police investigation, airline executives have admitted, and could have their homes searched.

Police in Malaysia have said they are looking at the 
psychological background of the pilots, their family life and 
connections as one line of inquiry into flight MH370's disappearance.

Pilots: The men were flying the pictured plane on route MH370 when it disappeared

In the days since the flight, from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, went missing it has emerged that Shah was so passionate about flying he has is own flight simulator at home, and that Hamid once invited two women to spend an entire flight in the cockpit with him.

The men may have their homes searched 
as part of the probe, as new information suggests that the plane's 
course was diverted by capable pilots.

Earlier today two
 sources familiar with the 
investigation said radar evidence suggests that the route the plane is thought to have taken after its last known position suggested it was being flown by trained pilots.

They believe the flight was moving between fixed waypoints which guide professional pilots along well-trodden routes.

It was also pointed out that the first communication system to lose track of the plane - its on-board transponders - can be turned off by the pilots.

While
 there is no evidence linking them to any wrongdoing, airline executives
 admitted that police were pursuing the line of enquiry.

The
 possibility has also been raised that the pilots were acting 'under 
duress'. Many have also rushed to defend the pilots' good names in light
 of the investigation.

Details of their backgrounds have emerged from interviews with neighbours, Malaysia Airlines staff, a religious leader and from social networks.

According to a local mosque leader, Hamid is a 'good boy, a good Muslim, humble and quiet'.

Ahmad
 Sarafi Ali Asrah, who works near Fariq's two-storey home in a 
middle-class are of Kuala Lumpur, also spoke of the distress his 
disappearance.

He described Hamid's parents as distraught and the community solidly behind them, supporting the family in prayers.

'His father still cries when he talks about Fariq. His mother too,' said Ahmad Sarafi.

Hamid,
 the son of a high-ranking civil servant in Selangor state, joined 
Malaysia Airlines in 2007. With just 2,763 hours of flight experience he
 had only recently started co-piloting the sophisticated Boeing 777.

He had a short brush with fame when he was filmed recently for a CNN programme.

Reporter
 Richard Quest called it a perfect landing of a Boeing 777-200, the same
 model as the twin-aisle plane that went missing. An online tribute page
 to the pilots shows a photo of Fariq in the cockpit with Quest, both 
smiling.

Neighbor Ayop Jantan said he had heard that Hamid was engaged and planning his wedding. The eldest of five children, his professional achievements were a source of pride for his father, said Jantan, a retiree.

Hamid's superior, Shah, joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and has more than 18,000 flight hours.

His
 Facebook profile includes pictures of him flying remote-controlled aircraft, posting pictures of his collection which 
included a lightweight twin-engine helicopter and an amphibious 
aircraft.

Born in northern 
Penang state, the bald-headed captain and grandfather is also an 
enthusiastic handyman and proud home cook.

As part of what he called 
'community service', he had posted several YouTube videos including how 
to make air conditioners more efficient to cut electricity bills, how to
 waterproof window panes and how to repair a refrigerator icemaker.

A
 Malaysian Airline stewardess who had flown with Shah several times said
 he was 'very nice, very friendly and safety-conscious'. She didn't want
 to be named because of company policy prohibiting employees from 
speaking to the media.

Neighbours
 of both men also praised their commitment to the community. Hamid 
played futsal, a modified form of soccer popular in Southeast Asia, with
 neighborhood youngsters and paid for their sports shirts.

Shah was known for bringing food he cooked himself to community events or making sure his wife and children did when he couldn't attend. A supporter of Malaysia's main opposition parties, he had volunteered to be a poll monitor in recent elections.

Yet both Hamid and Shah have quirks that reveal a more colorful side to their pilot personas.

Grabbing attention were pictures Shah posted online of the flight simulator he built for his home using three large computer monitors and other accessories.

Asked at a news conference whether it was unusual for pilots to have such equipment at home, Malaysia Airlines CEO Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said 'everyone is free to do his own hobby'.

Shah is certified by Malaysia's Department of Civil Aviation as a flight simulator examiner, according to Malaysia Airlines.

Special prayers were held at the KLIA Mosque near the Kuala Lumpur International Airport today for those on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 which has now been missing without trace for nearly a week

Hamid has drawn greatest scrutiny after the revelation he and another pilot invited two women boarding their aircraft to sit in the cockpit for a flight from Phuket, Thailand, to Kuala Lumpur in 2011.

During the flight, the pilots smoked and flirted, one of the women, South African Jonti Roo, said in an interview broadcast by Australia's Nine Network. The claims were backed with numerous photos showing Roos and her friend posing in the cockpit.

Though initially thrilled by the experience, Roos also described it as 'possibly a little bit sleazy'.

Malaysia Airlines said it was shocked by the claims and is investigating.

'I don't think he is a playboy,' said Ahmad Sarafi, the imam at the mosque Hamid prayed at. 'But I don't know about his personal life.'
