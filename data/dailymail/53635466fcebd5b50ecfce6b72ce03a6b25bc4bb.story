It is not even on the market for another six months, but one eagle-eyed teenager has spotted the hotly-anticipated Jaguar F-Type coupe heavily camouflaged in a supermarket car park.

The £80,000 model is the coupe version of the much sought-after sports car, regarded as one of the world's best looking car.

Jaguar announced last week the car would make its global debut at next week’s LA Motor Show with deliveries beginning in Spring 2014.

But car enthusiast Rob Barker got a sneak preview of the sports car when he spotted it in a supermarket car park in Leamington Spa.

The Jaguar test driver made a hasty exit when he saw the college student with his camera, but not before the 18-year-old got a few pictures.

Mr Barker, from Leamington Spa, said: 'I spotted this Jaguar prototype at the Shire’s shopping park in Leamington on Sunday afternoon.

'As soon as I saw it I knew it was a prototype from either Aston Martin or Jaguar/Land Rover because they have factories at Gaydon, and sometimes bring their cars around the local area for testing purposes.

'They are always wrapped in this strange camouflage to hide the body so that people can’t see what’s underneath, but I think it’s very eye catching and it seemed to attract a lot of unwanted attention.

'The car sounded incredible and looked amazing too. I’ve never really liked Jaguars, but the company’s latest models are certainly changing my view.'

The car was spotted in Leamington Spa, around ten miles from Gaydon in Warwickshire which is the headquarters for Jaguar Land Rover

Leamington Spa is around ten miles from Gaydon in Warwickshire which is the headquarters for Jaguar Land Rover.

The British brand, which is owned by Indian conglomerate Tata, is one of the world’s most profitable car manufacturers.

Last week it announced sales for the most recent quarter were up 21 per cent with a staggering 102, 644 vehicles sold.

For the first half of the financial year it has boasted revenues of more than £8billion with profits of £1.1billion - an increase of 42 per cent.

The firm is hoping the coupe, which will be available as a V6 or V8 and cost between £55,000 and £80,000, will help boost sales figures further.

The Jaguar F-Type Coupe is set to make its global debut on November 19, the eve of the Los Angeles auto show.

The all-aluminium range is said to complement the award-winning F-Type Convertible range.Ian Callum, director of design at Jaguar, said: 'We've been overwhelmed by the positive reaction to F-Type Convertible, but for me the purity of creating a sports Coupé is a uniquely satisfying process - and I know that both visually and dynamically, F-TYPE Coupé raises the bar yet again.'

Full technical details of the Coupe have not yet been released, but will be made available at the Los Angeles auto show.

It is regarded as the spiritual successor
 to the iconic Jaguar E-Type which has been voted the world’s most 
beautiful car in the past.

The F-Type Coupe will make its official world debut on November 20 during next week’s Los Angeles Motor Show.

Jaguar declined to discuss the F-Type’s spotting, only pointing to previous comments made about its hotly-anticipated unveiling.

It is not the first time the car has been spotted in public. A prototype of the coupe was spotted parked on the streets of Manhattan in July, according to Auto Express.

It was also seen testing at the Nurburgring earlier in the year, according to Motor Authority.

In July MailOnline reported how the brand new Rolls Royce Wraith was spotted in the street as one of the engineers tested it on the road before it went on sale.

The pictures emerged before it had even made its public debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex.
