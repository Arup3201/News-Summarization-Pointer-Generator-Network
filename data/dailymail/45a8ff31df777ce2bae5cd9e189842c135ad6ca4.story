Former footballer John Hartson - who beat the odds to survive testicular cancer - has been pictured with his 'miracle' third child.

The ex-Celtic striker needed emergency surgery in 2009 when cancer spread to his brain and lungs and at one stage he was given '50-50' chances of survival.

But having battled through chemotherapy treatment to beat off the deadly disease, he is now celebrating after his wife, Sarah, gave birth to 6lb 2oz baby Paige Faith.

Miracle: Hartson admitted he did not expect to be a father again after his battle with cancer

Hartson, who already has two daughters with Sarah, five-year-old Lena and four-year-old Stephanie, feared he would never be a father again after he was diagnosed with cancer five years ago.

The 39-year-old told Wales Online: 'I have managed to father two perfect little daughters and I do see it as a little bit of a miracle. I came very close to leaving this place and now I feel blessed.'

Shortly after the birth on April 19, he tweeted: 'Paige faith hartson born 19-4-14. 12.23pm weighing 6.2pounds.. We're both absolutely delighted mother and baby girl doing well.'

Swansea-born Hartson scored over a 150 goals during his career and was capped 51 times for Wales.

But a year after his retirement from the game in 2008, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer that doctors said had spread to his brain and lungs.

Describing the diagnosis on the website of his charity, The John Hartson Foundation, the former player wrote: 'The way I saw it, I was 31, I was fathering kids, I was training hard every day, I was moving clubs – I was doing everything that was asked of me.

He added: 'I was also, if I’m honest, pretty ignorant about the symptoms of testicular cancer and the importance of getting treatment early. I had no idea of the danger I was putting myself in.

'It wasn’t until I started suffering the most horrendous headaches that I went to see my GP and mentioned the lumps.

'Within days I found out the lumps were testicular cancer and the headaches were the result of a tumour.

'I had waited so long to get checked that the cancer had spread to my lungs and my brain and I was diagnosed with stage-four cancer.'

Campaign: Hartson has since set up his own charity to raise awareness of testicular cancer

Battle: Hartson was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 34, when he already had three children

During his treatment, doctors gave Hartson and his wife the option of freezing his sperm, but they decided not to.

They discovered Sarah, now 41, was pregnant with their second daughter Stephanie while he was still in remission in 2009.

Hartson - who also has two children from an earlier relationship, teenage daughter Rebecca and 11-year-old son Joni - has since worked to raise awareness of the importance of early checks.

Writing for his charity, he added: 'Had I got the lumps checked when I first discovered them, I could have spared myself months of operations and gruelling treatments, not to mention the worry I could have saved my family in the process.

'So I urge you – don’t do as I did, do as I say. Check yourself regularly, know what to look for and get anything out of the ordinary seen to by your GP. It could save your life.'

He has since made a full recovery and has been given the all clear by doctors.
