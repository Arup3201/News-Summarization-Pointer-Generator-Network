Mollie King may have earned the title of fashionista thanks to her edit for Oasis but another member of The Saturdays is giving her a run for her money in the style stakes.

Rochelle Humes has just unveiled her debut fashion range for Very.co.uk and it's full of trend-led flattering summer designs that she hopes every woman out there will look great in.

Speaking to MailOnline about the launch of the collection, Rochelle said:'My new range is really print driven and I've ensured that the pieces can be worn day to night, dressed up with heels and down with flats.'

Singer turned designer: Rochelle Humes, who is one fifth of The Saturdays, has turned her hand to designing for Very.co.uk and her colourful range is full of flattering cuts and shapes (dress, £49)

The new mother, who gave birth to Alaia-Mai, her daughter with ex-JLS star Marvin, 14 months ago, has used her experience of maternity wear and her changing shape to create a flattering range.

She said: 'I'm conscious now I'm a mother and I've made sure every single piece is really flattering; I've had lots of fun with it. 

She sure knows what works! Rochelle, who gave birth to her daughter 14 months ago, has used her experience of motherhood to ensure that every piece in her new range flatters women and shows off their best assets (jumpsuit, £55)

Inspiration: Rochelle, who cites Blake Lively and Eva Mendes as her style icons, has used vertical stripes on her dresses because she believes they elongate a woman's body (dress, £39)

'I've been very particular with the cuts of the clothes and there's lots of jumpsuits, which I loved to wear during and after my pregnancy because they highlight my best bits - my arms and neck - and covered everything else!'

Using her own knowledge of what works, Rochelle has included vertical stripes in her 18-piece range because, as she says, they elongate you, and has added plenty of playsuits and jumpsuits for days when 'you just don't know what to wear'.

The 25-year-old, who cites Eva Mendes and Blake Lively as her style icons, says she took inspiration from her friends when designing the range but also took sneaky snaps of stylish women in the street.

Real women: The singer says she doesn't care for celebrities wearing her range but would love to see everyday women walking down the street in her designs

And forget celebrity fans because Rochelle wants to see real women wearing her range. 'Women don't often feel confident putting an outfit together and that's what I want to change. I'd love nothing more than walking down the street and seeing women wearing my clothes,' she said.

Speaking about her husband's style, Rochelle said: 'He does well by himself so I don't offer much advice but I got rid of the low V-neck T-shirts, the time is up, Marvin!

'He said: "But I wore them when we dated" and I said: "Oh yes, but I knew I could change you!".'

The husband and wife duo
 will be covering for Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on This Morning as they 
take their summer break, but Rochelle has still had time to squeeze in another clothing range for the e-tailer.

'My Christmas stuff for Very is ready to go,' she said. 'Workwise, I'm covered for the rest of the year.'

Style shake-up: Rochelle said that she has made Marvin ditch the V-neck shirts he loved in his JLS days, right

Showcasing her work: Rochelle launched her designs at a fashion show last week in central London
