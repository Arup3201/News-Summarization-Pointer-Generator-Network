Thousands of acres of fertile land in the floodplains of the Hindon River - an ecologically sensitive zone - has been usurped by the land mafia in Noida and illegally sold to buyers for constructing houses.

Already, hundreds of concrete structures have mushroomed on these plots, some houses sitting only metres away from the river's course.

The district administration is aware of the plunder of real estate in the Sorkha-Noida Extension area.

Several buildings, including these, have mushroomed illegally on the floodplains of the Hindon River

'It is illegal. No construction can be undertaken in the floodplains. I passed an order recently, warning potential buyers that they should not buy such plots,' district magistrate Hridesh Kumar said.

'While visiting the Chhajarsi village some time ago, I saw first-hand illegal houses along Hindon's embankment. We plan to crack down on the offenders in a harsh manner,' he said.

Asked if criminals and gangsters were behind the land-grabbing, Kumar said: 'Of course, they are. No ordinary person would get involved in it.' The illegal houses not only pose a threat to the river ecology but to the area's mythological heritage as well.

The illegal buildings, marked by the red dots, on Hindon's floodplains are two kilometres away from the land scam site

'Hindon's original name is Harnandi in Shiv Mahapuran. This land is the taposthali (abode) of Rishi Vishwawa, the father of King Ravan. Several old temples, some dating back to a thousand years, still exist today in Bisrakh near the river.

'The river embankment is also a rich habitat of birds and peacocks. The illegal constructions are destroying the rich heritage and wildlife,' Dushyant Nagar of farmers' association Kisan Sanghrash Samiti said.

The place where the mafia has usurped the plots is located barely 50m from Noida Extension, the address of another multicrore land scam that was uncovered in 2010. In Noida Extension, the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) bought farmland at throwaway prices to set up SEZs but sold the real estate to private builders, who built flats and sold them to buyers.

The fate of those flats is now locked in litigations in both the Supreme Court and the Allahabad High Court. Altogether, more than 2,500 acres of land in the floodplains of Hindon has been sold by the mafia over the past three years, helped by unscrupulous government officials.

What's the scam?Thousands of acres of land in the floodplains of Hindon River havebeen sold by the land mafia, allegedly hand in glove with UPgovernment officials, to private buyers. Already, scores ofconcrete structures have  mushroomed on these plots, some as close as 20m from the river's course

Who sold the land to the mafia?Farmers of adjoining villages such as Sorkha and Sarfabad, who were the original owners of the plots. Land-use and jurisdiction, however,rests with the UP irrigation department

Can houses be built on these plots?River basin regulations stipulate that only farming can be  undertaken in the floodplains- and nothing else. In 'protected' floodplains, even farming is prohibited and needs the environment ministry's nod

The plots have been sold mostly to people from West Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and even illegal Bangladeshi migrants. Local real estate dealers put the value of the land at nearly Rs 1,000 crore, at Rs 1 crore per hectare.

The encroached floodplain is enclosed by roads on two sides and slices the Gautam Budh Nagar district into Noida and Greater Noida. The plots sold by the mafia originally belonged to farmers residing in nearby villages such as Sorkha and Sarfabad, who undertook farming in these land holdings.

The land-use and jurisdiction, however, rests with the irrigation department. Under river basin regulations, the floodplain can only be used for farming and not for any other purposes.

Construction of any kind is not permitted. In a 'protected' floodplain, even farming is prohibited and requires the permission of the Union environment ministry.

Sources said most land sharks operating in the stretch are hardened criminals and gangsters, linked to the ruling government and regional political parties. The land sharks are in cahoots with officials in the registrar's office.

The mafia makes farmers sign blank stamp papers. Dishonest officials get the agreement registered without physically verifying the land in question and checking its land-use.

The officials do it knowingly, well aware that plots with sizes 120 sqm and less that come up before them for registration are too less a holding size for agriculture purposes and would be used to build houses. Further, the registrar officials facilitate the registration without obtaining the mandatory SDM report on the land in question.

Officials in the tehsildar's office are also in cahoots with the mafia. The tehsildars get the mutation (transfer of ownership) done merely on the basis of the patwari's report, who connives with the land mafia and submit their reports about the status of the said land.

When this correspondent posed as a decoy customer before one of the property dealers, named Hira Lal Gupta, he offered plots in his colony named 'Khuaja City'.

'We have plots of all sizes. The plots are priced at Rs 5,500 to Rs 7,000 per square metre. There are two roads, one 20 feet wide and another 15 feet, connecting these plots,' Hira Lal said. 'The plots are very good, close to Noida and Noida Extension.

The Phase-II industrial area is close by. You won't get such a premium plot for such a price anywhere in Noida,' he said. Will flooding pose a threat to the houses? Pat comes the reply: 'This is hardly a river now.'
