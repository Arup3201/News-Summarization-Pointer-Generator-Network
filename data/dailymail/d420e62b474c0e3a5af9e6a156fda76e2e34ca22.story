Harvard University students who were unable to sit their exams this morning following a bomb threat do not have to take the tests, officials have said.

The canceled exams mean that, if a student claimed there were explosives in order to get out of the Ivy League college's tough tests, then he or she may very well have been granted their wish.

Four buildings at the Cambridge, Massachusetts university were evacuated just around 9am after campus police received an email claiming explosives had been planted inside.

But just two hours - and following preliminary sweeps by local police, bomb squads and the FBI - police sources suggested that the threat was a hoax. It coincides with exam time at the university.

On Monday afternoon, school officials told the campus newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, that students would be allowed to use the grades from previous work in a course as their final grade.

Alternatively,
 they can opt to get a pass or fail grade for the class; the 
university allows all students to complete a certain number of 
'Pass/Fail' classes during their degree.

Some
 exams have been rescheduled for 6.30pm this evening or for next semester - but officials told the Crimson that students could opt to
 take the exam or the other grading options above.

The announcement sparked anger and debate online, with many saying that the exams should be rescheduled for everyone.

'Assuming
 the purpose of hoax was to cancel finals, wouldn't canceling finals 
reward said behavior?' one Twitter user asked, while another agreed: 
'Doesn't set a good precedent.'

In
 addition, John L. Ellison, the Associate Dean of College and 
Administrative Board Secretary, said if students did not feel well 
enough prepared for 2pm exams, they could also choose not to sit them.

'If for any reason a student does not feel able to take an exam - including anxiety, loss of study time, lack of access to material and belongings left in one of the affected buildings, or travel schedule - he or she should be in touch immediately with his or her resident dean,' Ellison said.

It was a fraught day for universities in Boston, which is still reeling from the bombings at the marathon eight months ago.

The FBI, police departments and bomb-sniffing dogs had descended on Harvard after the school received the bomb threats by email around 9am.

An hour later, the University of 
Massachusetts in Boston sent out an alert over Twitter telling students 
to evacuate the McCormack Building because of a suspected gunman.

'Possible person with a firearm,' it read. 'Avoid area. Officials are on scene.'

Moments later, state police tweeted: 
'There were reports of a threat at @UmassBoston. There is no threat. 
False report. Scene is clear.'

Students at Harvard had been issued an emergency alert shortly after 9am, instructing them to leave the Science
 Center and three other buildings - Sever Hall, which contains 
classrooms for the humanities, Emerson Hall, the philosophy building, 
and Thayer Hall, a freshman dorm.

But within two hours, CNN reported that 
the Harvard University Campus Police had been given the 'all clear' and 
that the incident was apparently a hoax. All four of the buildings have now 
been reopened.

Harvard said that a search for explosive devices was being conducted but that none had been found.

Evacuations: Students gather in the Science Center Plaza at Harvard University on Monday after police received unconfirmed reports that explosives had been planted at four campus buildings

The campus newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, shared a photograph of students swarming the Science Center Plaza after the threats were reported.

The paper also said that students have filled the study hall at Annenberg Hall after being evacuated.

Tom Fuentes, a law enforcement analyst, told CNN the search
 for explosives was likely to continue throughout the day due to the sheer size of 
the buildings.

The Science Center, for example, has 20 general-use classrooms
 as well as five lecture halls, teaching laboratores for the sciences 
and other resources.

Ben Forman, an employee at the Harvard
 Book Store near to the campus gates, said the atmosphere around the 
college was not too panicked.

Second threat: The University of Massachusetts in Boston (pictured) also reported a possible person with a firearm on campus on Monday - but this turned out to be a hoax

Sites: Explosives may have been placed at four properties indicated on this map: the Science Center, Thayer Hall, Sever Hall and Emerson Hall - one is a freshman dorm and two more are classrooms

Scene: Harvard (pictured) is less than three miles from the scene of the Boston bombings in April

'It looks pretty relaxed out there actually,' he said. 'There is a gate closed into the yard, but its not panicked.'

Three of the buildings border Harvard Yard and access to the Yard has been restricted to residents with Harvard IDs.

The bomb threats come almost exactly eight months to the day that two explosives were detonated at the Boston Marathon finish line, killing three and injuring hundred more. The homemade bombs exploded less than three miles from Harvard's campus.
