These pictures show iconic female cartoon characters as you've never seen them before. 

An artist has redrawn classic animated ladies as breast cancer survivors in a bid to raise awareness for those battling the disease.

Italian artist and activist AleXsandro Palombo's latest project, called 'Survivor' shows what Marge Simpson, Jessica Rabbit and Wonder Woman would look like if they underwent surgery to remove their breasts.

The cast includes a posing Lois Griffin from Family Guy, Princess Jasmine from Aladdin, Betty Boop, Snow White, Olive Oyl, Cinderella, Wilma Flintstone and Wonder Woman and Jessica Rabbit covering her remaining breast with a purple-gloved hand.

The Milan-based artist, who has previously portrayed the same cast of characters as domestic abuse victims, is known for his colourful and thought-provoking satirical work.

And his latest work aims to help breast cancer survivors find the courage to embrace their bodies.

Snow White has also had a double mastectomy. The artist describes the surgery as 'devastating' for women

The message is one of 'hope and courage' because of the mental strength required by women who have had mastectomies to save their lives. 

Mr Palombo described the series is a 'powerful reflection on the disease, mastectomy and its effects, female identity and acceptance.' 

He told MailOnline: 'I believe that we must create awareness to young people and teach them health education.

'Breast cancer is a disease that can also affect younger women.

'The acceptance of your own body mutilated by a mastectomy is one of the devastating moments that is part of the disease. 

'You must be very strong to be able to react psychologically and accept the new appearance of your own body.

'My message is one of hope and courage.'
