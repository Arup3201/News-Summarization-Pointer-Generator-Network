A woman who donated nearly £650,000 to a hospital in her son's memory is asking for the money back, after the health board failed to spend it in a decade.

Chris Evans-Thomas lost her 35-year-old son Adam to leukemia in 2004.

His last wish was to improve cancer services at Withybush General Hospital in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, Wales, but ten years later, his legacy has still not been invested.

Now Ms Evans-Thomas wants the money back in order to fund another charitable venture.

As his illness progressed, Mr Evans-Thomas wanted to give something back to the hospitals that helped him and he began raising money through Adam's Bucketful of Hope appeal to refurbish the cancer ward at Withybush and build a new cancer day unit.

When he died, his mother took on the legacy and through the high-profile nature of her son's campaign, she helped to raise £649,776 for cancer services in Pembrokeshire.

She told the BBC she had repeatedly been given dates for when his wish would be fulfilled but it never has, and now she wants the money back.

She added her son would be 'very, very saddened' by the length of time it was taking for anything to happen.

Ms Evans-Thomas, who has received an MBE for her fundraising, said she would not give up until she had 'got something to show, to have some meaning why Adam had to go'.

She worked in the hospital school in Withybush General Hospital just one ward away from where Adam was treated.

Adam, who was a signals engineer on the railways, was a 25-year-old in the prime of life when he started to get unexplained headaches and put on weight.

When he went to his GP he was first prescribed paracetamol, but as he got to the door of the doctor's office, he asked him to look at his distended stomach - and was promptly rushed into hospital.

Adam underwent numerous courses of chemotherapy and what is known as an autologous transplant, where bone marrow is taken out of the body and cleaned before being put back in again.

He also had countless blood transfusions in hospital and always praised doctors and hospital staff for their care of him during his time in hospital.

Ms Evans-Thomas said that despite his fortnightly visits to the doctor, six-monthly checksand numerous drugs, Adam never let the leukemia take over his life.

She said:'I've never once thought as his mother that I was going to lose him.

Withybush General Hospital in Pembrokeshire, Wales, says it still plans to refurbish the cancer unit, ten years after the money was donated

Hywel Dda health board told BBC Wales that £550,000 had been committed to the refurbishment of the main cancer ward at Withybush and to build a cancer day unit.

The health board said the new unit would 'realise the time, effort and investment that has been made by those fundraising in the county'.

'The capital build is only part of the challenge as all service/units that we provide require a review of staffing to ensure that they are sustainable in the long term," it said in a statement.

'We continue to work hard with colleagues, partner organisations and stakeholders, including our charitable fundraisers, to ensure we provide the best care possible for cancer patients and will continue to work closely with them on the development of the new chemotherapy day unit.'
