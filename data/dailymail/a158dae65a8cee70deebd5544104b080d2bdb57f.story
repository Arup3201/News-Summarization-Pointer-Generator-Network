Space is a mysterious place and could contain unknown massive structures that act like 'giant vacuum cleaners that suck galaxies towards them and tilt our universe', according to one expert.

He points out that cocooned on our relatively comfortable planet, humans tend to think that we have quite a good notion of the laws of the universe.

He claims that we believe we live on a small planet orbiting the sun on the fringes of the Milky Way galaxy, which space enthusiast David Glenn dubs a 'thoroughly unremarkable galaxy' in an infinite universe.

Space is a mysterious place and could contain unknown massive structures that act like 'giant vacuum cleaners, titling our universe', according to space expert David Glenn. Pictured is a black hole, which is a region of spacetime from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping

According to Glenn, most us us think 'the laws of physics do not change across the universe, even if what we are examining is billions of light-years away.'

This theory is called the Copernican Principle, upon which experts base most of their scientific knowledge about the universe.

But, Glenn said it could be very wrong.

Scientists have started to look more carefully at the structure of the universe by analysing light from distant galaxies to look at the speed and direction of moving objects like planets and stars.

They have observed that rather than moving apart as expected, some distant clusters of galaxies actually appear to be caught in a space current, much like a river.

And they are moving at incredibly fast velocities or around two million miles an hour, along a certain path.

Scientists are unsure why but have labeled the phenomenon 'dark flow'.

To work out why this must be happening, Glenn said scientists believe there must be 'something huge out there.'

'It would have to be so large that it is bigger than anything scientists have seen in the known universe before.'

Glenn added that it could be so massive it could dwarf galactic clusters, which could be drawn towards it as if the huge object were a giant space vacuum cleaner.

Scientists thinks that this mysterious massive body is so large that is possibly titling our universe.

Scientists are unsure why galaxies are traveling in unusual directions but have labeled the phenomenon 'dark flow'. It is a good job there is not a giant unknown object close to the Milky Way or our neighbouring Andromeda galaxy (pictured) or life as we know it would be changed

But it is currently impossible to explore the theory, according to Glenn, because scientists have no technology capable of seeing massive structures outside our observable universe, which has a radius of around 45.7 billion light years.

He highlights the incredible idea that while the universe has existed for 14 billion years, light from beyond the known universe has not had enough time to reach our telescopes.

Some scientists have reportedly tried to explain this phenomenon by suggesting that a neighbouring universe could be causing the incredible pull and tilt.

While it might take several lifetimes for scientists to develop the technology necessary to identify what these massive objects are, they currently have the power to make experts question the principle of universal uniformity, Glenn said.
