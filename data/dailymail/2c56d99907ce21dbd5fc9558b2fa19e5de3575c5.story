Alan Pardew has likened Jack Colback to England World Cup winner Alan Ball following his inclusion in Roy Hodgson’s senior squad.

The Newcastle midfielder has been named called up for next month’s friendly with Norway and the Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland.

Colback signed for the Magpies during the summer in a controversial switch from North-East rivals Sunderland.

Kind words: Alan Pardew and Roy Hodgson have both hailed Jack Colback after his England call-up

But his early-season form has seen him rewarded with a maiden call to the England set-up and United boss Pardew says it is about time another ginger midfielder made the breakthrough.

‘He's a terrific player, the last time we won a World Cup we had a ginger in Alan Ball. Now we've got another one. It’s about time,’ said Pardew.

‘When he joined I said I think he can play for England. My confidence in him was assured. What I have seen on the training ground makes me more confident.

‘The England manager has seen him make a high-profile move and then deal with it. That is part of the reason he has got in the England team. The England manager will look at things like that, it’s not just about playing.

‘It’s about the pressure of playing on Premier League and England duties. The transfer to us and the way he has dealt with it are real ticks in the box for Jack.

‘Sunderland fans knew he was our player anyway, they just stole him for a little while.’

Pardew, though, is surprised by the immediacy of Colback’s elevation.

‘When we spoke to him, I said to him I think you should set your sights on the England team because what I've seen of you and the profile you're going to have here it's going to give you a massive chance of it,’ he added.

"It's come a lot sooner than I thought, but he played very well in pre-season so the timing of it is good for him. He's ready.

‘We're very fortunate to have him. I'm looking forward to seeing him. I hope he gets a chance to get some part of the game in these two games.’
