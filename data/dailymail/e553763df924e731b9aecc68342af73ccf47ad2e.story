Hull KR have signed Leeds' long-serving forward Ryan Bailey on a two-year contract.

The Robins have acted quickly to fill the void created by the sudden retirement of Australian prop Justin Poore by recruiting the 30-year-old Bailey, who has spent all his career at the Rhinos, with whom he won six Grand Finals, three World Club Challenge titles and this year's Challenge Cup.

He is now set to make his Hull KR debut against his home-town club in the opening match of the new Super League season in February.

'I've achieved a lot of things at Leeds over a 14-year period but I'm ready for a new challenge at Hull KR,' said Bailey, who made more than 300 appearances for Leeds.

'It was a difficult decision to leave Leeds, I was born in the city and I've won some great finals with the club but now I want to bring some of that experience to Rovers. It's going to be a big challenge but I'm looking forward to it and I'll be meeting it head on.

'The fans are really passionate and hopefully we can breed a winning culture and start getting to finals. We've got some really ambitious players who want to win things here at Hull KR and hopefully I can add to that and bring a bit of grunt up front.

'We've got a big game at the start of the season against Leeds and that will be a perfect way to hopefully make my debut. I know from experience that the ground is a daunting place to go to, it's tough for opposition teams and we've got to make the most of that.

'I know the ins and outs of all the players at Leeds so hopefully I can pass on a few things to Chezzy (coach Chris Chester) and we can get a win first game of the season to get us up and running.'

Bailey will be reunited at Hull KR with former Leeds team-mate Willie Poching, who is the club's newly-appointed assistant coach.

'Ryan is a fantastic signing and an important one for the club,' said Poching, who has moved to East Yorkshire from Warrington.

'With Justin Poore retiring, we lost a lot of experience there and a bit of grunt up front and that's what Ryan brings to the table. He has a wealth of experience at Super League level and also in big games.'
