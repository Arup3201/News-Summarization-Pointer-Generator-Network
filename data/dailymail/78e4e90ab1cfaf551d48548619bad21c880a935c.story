Tyson Fury has challenged fellow British heavyweight Anthony Joshua to a pre-Christmas  showdown.

The undefeated 6ft 9in bruiser must first overcome Dereck Chisora in London next month in what will be just his second fight in 18 months.

But he has already set his sights on Olympic gold medallist Joshua who has won his first nine fights as a professional.

Fury tweeted: '[There is] too much talking and avoiding going on in world heavyweight boxing. Let it not be just about the money, it's killing boxing. Let's fight each other.

'I challenge Anthony Joshua to a fight in December after I smash Chisora.

'Eddie Hearn (Joshua's promoter) would never dream of putting Joshua in the same ring as me so stop going on about it. [He] wouldn't last three rounds.'

Anthony Joshua won his first title in his ninth fight with a second-round knockout of Denis Bakhtov

Joshua has impressed with his blistering power since turning professional 12 months ago

Hearn responded: 'Correct, you wouldn't last three rounds. Time will tell, concentrate on your fight; hope it happens for you.

'Give me a call after your scheduled fight.'

Joshua has knocked out each of his opponents to date and takes on Michael Sprott in Liverpool on November 22.

Hearn wants Joshua to face American Kevin Joshua early next year before fighting the loser of Fury vs Chisora.

David Price is another name on the 25-year-old's radar as he looks to build on his impressive start.
