Suspect: Vinh Van Nguyen, 41 (pictured), was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of killing his girlfriend, 45-year-old Tuyet Huynh, her 20-year-old daughter Trinh Pham and son-in-law Sean Pham, 21

A quiet family of three was found shot to death in their Wichita, Kansas home early Tuesday, and the matriarch's boyfriend is suspected of carrying out the grisly crime.

Vinh Van Nguyen, 41, was arrested after police found him in the master bedroom with his dead girlfriend, 45-year-old homeowner Tuyet Huynh.

Huynh's 20-year-old daughter Trinh Pham and son-in-law Sean Pham, 21, were also found gunned down in the suburban residence. The only person in the house unharmed besides the suspect, was the Pham's 5-month-old son Carsen.

Police are still investigating what sparked the triple homicide, and say there were no previous cases of domestic violence or criminal activity at the residence.

Trinh Pham is believed to be the family member who called 911 just after midnight, while the shooting was still raging.

Officers responded within minutes of Mrs Pham's call, but were too late.

By the time they circled the home on the 2200 block of South Beech Street, they could already see the bodies of Ms Huynh and Mr Pham lying dead on the ground floor.

Ms Huynh was found in the master bedroom along with her boyfriend, while Mr Pham was found in the hallway.

Orphaned: Besides Nguyen, the only person to survive the rampage was the Pham's 5-month-old son Carsen (face blurred in image above with his parents)

A call for help: Mrs Pham is believed to be the person who called 911 shortly after midnight, before she was found gunned down in the home's basement

Mrs Pham was found in the home's basement, next to her unharmed infant son.

Officers arrested Nguyen at the scene and say he did not resist them. They also recovered a weapon at the scene.

Nguyen is being held on $2million bond at the Sedgewick County Jail on multiple counts of capital murder. Formal charges against Nguyen are expected later this week.

According to police, the suspect and victims lived in the house together, and have been described by neighbors as a quiet family.

'I'll see them pull in the driveway sometimes but that's about it,' neighbor Steve Akins told KWCH. 'I mean, they're not real sociable like everybody else is around here, everybody mingles. They just kind of stick to themselves.'

The 5-month-old baby is now in the care of family members, as is a younger daughter of Ms Huynh's who was out of town at the time of the shooting

A close friend of Sean Pham has set up a Go Fund Me page to help cover funeral expenses. As of Tuesday evening, the fund had rasied more than $4,000 of its $15,000 goal. 

Other daughter: Ms Huynh had another younger daughter who was staying with family at the time of the shooting. Above a Wichita Police crime investigator enters the home on Tuesday
