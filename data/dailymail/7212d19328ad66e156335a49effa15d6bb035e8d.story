Tuesday night's Capital One Cup third round fixtures saw all 20 teams that played make changes to their line-ups from their weekend matches.

In total there were 117 changes made with 47 done by the seven Premier League sides with mixed results.

Ahead of their North London derby trip at arch-rivals Tottenham on Saturday, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger rung 10 changes with Calum Chambers the only player to start following their 3-0 win at Aston Villa last weekend.
