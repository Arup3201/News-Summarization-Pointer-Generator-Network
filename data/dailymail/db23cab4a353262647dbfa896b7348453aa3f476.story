Campaign groups have hit out at alcohol sold 'for pocket money' as one of the UK’s largest off licence chains sell bottles of booze for just 39p.

As debate rages over the Government’s plan to introduce a minimum price on an alcohol unit, top chain Rhythm and Booze is selling Turbo, a heady four per cent mix of lager and lemonade, for the tiny sum.With a Crunchie costing 69p and a packet of Munchies 82p, drinkers are able to pick up a 275 ml bottle of the alcoholic beverage for a fraction of the price.

Alcohol campaign groups have blasted cheap booze and claim youngsters are particularly vulnerable to alcohol sold at low prices.

The Rhythm and Booze off licence chain have had the promotion on show in their store in Farsley, West Yorkshire, pictured

The outlet in Farsley, West Yorkshire, 
had the bargain deal on display in the shop and confirmed a case of 24 
could be sold to a buyer - which would cost under a tenner.

Emily Robinson, Director of Campaigns at Alcohol Concern, said: 'We’re calling on the Government to implement a minimum price per unit for alcohol precisely because cheap alcohol sold at pocket money can be very damaging.

'We know that young people in particular are very vulnerable and as a society we’re all paying the price for cheap alcohol through costs to the NHS, policing and local councils.'

This week the Government announced controversial plans to tackle binge-drinking by introducing a higher-than-expected minimum price of 45p a unit for the sale of alcohol in England and Wales.

Conservative Councillor Rod Wood, who represents the Calverley and Farsley, said: 'A four percent bottle of Turbo being sold at 39 pence is certainly very cheap and that is stronger than most beers.”

But he added: 'I don’t think that the Government’s proposed changes to the price of alcohol will necessarily change the amount people drink. Our local licensees will, of course, conform to any changes in law, but I don’t believe this will reduce the level of alcohol consumed.'

A manager at the store, who refused to be named, said: 'It is a turbo shandy and personally I don't think that there is anything wrong with it.

'To be honest, I haven't really sold any of it. I don't think it appeals to the younger market and I certainly don't think the price has made younger people want to buy it.'

It is also considering banning multi-buy promotions, such as two-for-the-price-of-one.

The Home Office has launched a 10-week consultation on the plan, arguing it will help reduce the levels of ill-health and crime related to alcohol.
