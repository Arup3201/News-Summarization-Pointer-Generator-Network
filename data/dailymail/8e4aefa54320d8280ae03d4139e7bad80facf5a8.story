Refused: Sue Smith, above with guide dog Sonny, was left feeling 'embarrassed' after Shahzad Ahmad told her that he could not accept her fare

A taxi driver has been fined £1,000 after he refused to pick up a blind woman who was standing in the pouring rain because she had a guide dog.

Shahzad Ahmad, 32, told Sue Smith that he could not accept her fare because his vehicle wasn't big enough to fit five-year-old Labrador Sonny - even though he was driving a six-seater people carrier.

Ms Smith  left feeling 'scared' and 'embarrassed' when Ahmad drove away, leaving her and Sonny to be soaked on the street, Birmingham Magistrates Court heard.

The 50-year-old had phoned taxi firm T.C. Cars after visiting the headquarters of Action for Blind People in Birmingham on March 27.

But she was stunned when Mr Ahmad arrived and told her that he could not take her with Sonny. 

She was left 'embarrassed' and 'disorientated' in the street for 20 minutes as she tried to find her way back into the building she had just left. 

Ms Smith said that the incident has 'dented her confidence' and has left her scared to get into a taxi. 

It is an offence for a taxi driver not to take a blind person and their guide dog unless they have a medical exemption certificate for an allergy.

Ahmad was found guilty in his absence of breaching the Equality Act 2010 at Birmingham Magistrates Court on Wednesday. 

He was fined £1,000, ordered to pay court costs of £1,000 and a victim surcharge of £100.  

On Thursday, Ms Smith, who lives with long term partner, Colin, 50, said: 'I was so angry and scared. It was horrible.

'It was pouring with rain and if I hadn't been going to the Action for the Blind building I would have just been stranded in the city centre. God knows what I would have done.

'I have been on antidepressants since and I'm scared to get a taxi now. It has really dented my confidence.

'He just kept saying "no, no, no" even though I told him it was illegal. He was very rude and just drove off.'

Ahmad, from  Birmingham, has since been sacked by taxi firm and now faces losing his license.

John Kington, promotions manager at T.C. Cars, said: 'We acted swiftly and sharply as we do not tolerate this kind of behaviour at all.

'He was sacked straight away. Accommodating guide dogs is a requirement we are happy to meet and will continue to meet in future.'

Sue Bushell, from the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, added: 'Some drivers may have a fear of dogs but it is a legal requirement.'
