A secret recording in which a patient allegedly tells her married GP that he has ‘such a kissable mouth’ was played to a disciplinary panel yesterday.

Dr Simon Robinson could also be heard asking the woman to stroke his chest during the taped sex sessions at his surgery and in the patient’s home, it was claimed.

The two hour-long recordings – which feature sounds of kissing and heavy breathing – were made by the woman after she says she began to feel ‘used’ in their affair and decided to expose him.

The General Medical Council fitness to
practise panel convened yesterday to listen to the tapes along with 
both the doctor and his alleged ex-lover, who he called ‘my number one 
patient’.

At one point a male voice says ‘Stroke
my nipples’ and then ‘Thank you’ twice, to which the woman replies 
‘You’re welcome’, before the pair laugh.

At another, the pair discuss medical 
matters before both fall silent and for ten minutes the only sound is 
the patient making moaning noises.

Robinson admits he ‘overstepped the mark’ but denies the pair had a sexual relationship and claims the tapes are fabricated.

The 44-year-old GP, from Oswestry, 
Shropshire, is accused of conducting a 16-month affair between 2009 and 
2010 with the woman, who was referred to only as Patient A.

He allegedly
even asked her to call for a doctor when he was providing out-of-hours 
cover so he could come round to her house and have her perform a sex act
on him.

The affair allegedly lasted 16 months

Robinson, whose wife Catherine did not attend, is also accused of asking Patient A to send 
photographs of herself wearing lingerie as well as sending her cards 
with messages including: ‘Behave yourself and you’ll always be my number
one patient.’

Patient A allegedly decided to record 
the sex sessions using her mobile phone hidden in her handbag at his 
surgery and then on a windowsill at her home.

During one tape, Patient A was heard 
to say, ‘Well have you missed me?’, before noises of kissing and heavy 
breathing were heard over a ten-minute period.

In the second clip, Patient A is heard
to say, ‘You have such a kissable mouth’, followed by some inaudible 
sounds after which she says: ‘I really think you should run off with 
me.’

Patient A also compiled a diary during
the alleged romance. She submitted an item of clothing that she says 
had Robinson’s body fluid on it to the Manchester hearing.

Under cross-examination, Patient A 
denied claims by Robinson’s lawyer, Andrew Hockton, that she had 
‘fantasised’ about having a relationship with the GP.

The solicitor suggested that while 
sexual activity is alleged to have been taking place on the second tape,
Robinson had actually been out of the room as she had asked him to move
her washing machine.

Patient A has drawn a diagram of the 
GP’s body for the panel. On it she pinpointed the moles that she claims 
he has, as well as their shape and size. She has described them as red, 
flat and blotchy.

Mr Hockton said Robinson had told her he had a condition which meant he had lots of moles, but she denied knowing this.

Robinson, who denies many of the allegations against him, is accused of misconduct.

The hearing continues.
