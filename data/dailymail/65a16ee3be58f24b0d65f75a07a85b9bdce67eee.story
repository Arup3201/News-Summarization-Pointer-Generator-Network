Prince Harry was in Brasilia on Monday night to see Neymar score two first-half goals as Brazil took on Cameroon.

The Prince, who is starting a week-long tour of Brazil and Chile, will travel to Belo Horizonte on Tuesday to see Roy Hodgson's England face Costa Rica in their final, meaningless, Group D fixture.

But first he sat with the President of the Brazilian Football Confederation, Jose Maria Marin, to watch the hosts seal their progress to the knock-out stages

Earlier in the day the prince  was at 
the Rede Sarah hospital which treats patients with brain injuries and 
other neurological problems.

Despite
 looking a little bleary-eyed following a 15-hour flight from London, Harry was on typically chatty form as he met patients.

The
 Brasilia branch of the Sarah network of rehabilitation hospitals, of 
which there are 10 in Brazil, the medical centre specialises in rehabilitating 
the victims of serious brain injuries.

During the tour,
 the prince stopped to watch a group battling it out on 
court as they played wheelchair basketball and true to form, couldn't resist getting involved.

After around 10 minutes, play was stopped and the prince sat down for a chat - as well as a photo or two - with patients.

Sitting among the group of wheelchair-users, Harry put his arm round one small boy who smiled delightedly at the attention.

Later, the prince showed himself to be a dab hand when it comes to charming the ladies, leaving a little girl giggling helplessly during a chat.

Fun and games: Harry (centre back) seemed to be enjoying his visit to the hospital - despite the jetlag

Can't resist: Although Harry didn't fancy playing he couldn't resist joining in and doing a spot of refereeing

Thumbs up: Harry seemed impressed by the wheelchair basketball team who gave him a friendly thumbs up

Prince Popular: It seems that everyone wanted to get a picture with a smiling Prince Harry

Chatty man: Although Harry was too tired to play, the Prince was keen to talk to all the basketball players

Team player: Although Harry had been on a 15-hour flight he was quite happy to meet all of the patients

And when, at the end of his tour, he got
 a chance to go canoeing, the sporty prince simply couldn't resist and 
mucked in with other canoeists, all of whom were patients at the 
hospital, as they took to the water.

Beaming broadly, Harry then hopped into a bright yellow canoe 
for a paddle on Lake Paranoá, the second largest 
man-made water course in Brazil.

The
 trip to the hospital was his first stop on his tour of Brazil and 
Chile, which will later see him join the crowds at the Estádio Nacional 
de Brasilia for the Group A World Cup match between the hosts and 
Cameroon.

Tomorrow, Harry will travel to Belo Horizonte, the southeastern city that will be Team GB's base for the 2016 Olympic Games.

While
 there, he will tour training facilities for the UK's Olympic and 
Paralympic athletes before taking in his second match in two days - 
England's dead rubber game against Costa Rica at the Estádio Mineirão.

Forgotten your trunks? Unfortunately Harry had to stay on dry land at the pool at Rede Sarah Hospital

Friendly face: Harry was seen joking with patients and members of staff at the hospital

Keen: Not even jetlag could prevent the sporty Prince Harry from hopping into a canoe with patients

Sporty Prince: Harry is well known for his love of sports and seemed very engaged whilst canoeing

Buddies: The ever-popular Prince appeared to be getting along famously with the other canoeists

Having fun: Prince Harry laughs with fellow canoeists and patients at Rede Sarah on his first day in Brazil

Playful Prince: After his canoeing trip, Harry's next engagement is the Brazil vs Cameroon match tonight
