Discovery: Amanda Hutton, pictured outside court today, says she 'panicked' when she found her son Hamzah dead

The mother of a four-year-old boy found ‘mummified’ in her bedroom claimed he was a fussy eater who had starved himself, a court heard.

Amanda Hutton told police Hamzah Khan ‘would refuse point blank to eat’.

Hutton, 43, who denies manslaughter, is accused of starving her son to death and hiding his body for almost two years.

He was found in a mummified state by police investigating the stench at her Bradford home.

Hutton told police she had tried in vain to revive Hamzah on the day he died in December 2009. ‘I didn’t know what to do,’ she said.

Hamzah was found in September 2011, wearing clothing for a child of nine months.

Hutton continued to claim child benefit for her dead son, Bradford Crown Court heard. The trial continues.

The court earlier heard Hutton told police she held her son Hamzah Khan after he starved to death - but did not tell the authorities about the tragedy because she felt 'numb' and was scared of doctors.

The 43-year-old denies starving the boy, and said that she had repeatedly tried to make the four-year-old eat properly but he would only eat bananas and milk.

A jury at Bradford Crown Court also heard yesterday how the police officer who found Hamzah's body in September 2011 started shaking and had to leave the room when he made the horrific discovery.

Today the court heard transcripts from a series of police interviews with Hutton, from Bradford, when she was first arrested two years ago.

She told detectives that Hamzah had always been unusually small and said that it was impossible to make him eat properly.

'He stopped eating even more over time,' she said. 'I was worried about him. I didn't know what to do about him.

'I was at my wit's end. He had really, really started to lose weight. I started to panic even more. Then he stopped eating altogether.'

Hutton told officers that her son had fallen ill the day before he died, adding that she stayed up all night with him as he said: 'I love you mum. Are you alright mum?'

In the morning she went to a supermarket intending to talk to a chemist about Hamzah, but her adult son Tariq phoned her while she was at the store, telling her that the four-year-old's eyes were rolling back into his head.

She said she rushed home and gave the boy mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a bed, adding: 'I just panicked.

'I held him for quite a long time. I put him in the cot until I could think about what to do.'

Hutton added that she had tried massaging his heart for 10 minutes, saying that when that failed, 'I picked him up and cried.'

After Hamzah's death, she said, 'I was completely, completely numb. As each day went by, I just found it harder and harder to do anything about it.'

Dead: The four-year-old boy's body was left to 'mummify' for two years before it was recovered by police

Asked by interviewing officers why she did not seek medical assistance, Hutton said: 'I'm not a doctor person. I have a fear of doctors and things like that.'

She said that after her son's death she had begun to drink up to a litre of vodka every day and allowed her house to fall into a squalid state.

In one of the interviews, she said: 'He wasn't being starved, he would starve himself. He would not eat. He would refuse point blank to eat.'

'Ever since he's been born he's been fussy with eating. I just thought I could make him OK. I always worried about him. I worried about him from the day he was born.'

Shocked: Sergeant Richard Dove told the court he started shaking when he found Hamzah's body

She added: 'He was never a very happy child. He was quite a miserable child - that was just the way he was.'

Hutton admitted that in his last few months, Hamzah would mainly eat only bananas and milk, saying that although it was not a proper diet, 'It was all he would eat. At least it was something.'

Hutton said she tried to feed him the nourishment drink Complan to build him up. Asked if it worked, she told detectives: 'Not really, otherwise he would be here wouldn't he?'

The jury was told calls were made to Pizza Hut and the Spicy Delight takeaway in the hours after Hamzah's death.

The court also heard Hutton continued to claim Hamzah's child benefit after his death.

Earlier today, the policeman who found the boy's body told the court of his shock and disgust at discovering the corpse buried under layers of bedding, clothing and shoes.

Acting Sergeant Richard Dove said: 'I believe I can deal with any situation. But my right hand started shaking. I had to grab my hand to calm myself down. So I went downstairs.'

He said he made the discovery after going in to the bedroom for a second time, adding: 'I felt as though there was something wrong.'

Sgt Dove said: 'There was like clothing and shoes and bedding piled up in the cot. I started to take shoes and bedding off and working my way down through the layers.'

Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked the officer: 'What did you find?' Sgt Dove said: 'The body of a small child - Asian in origin.'

He said the boy was wearing a white baby-gro and his head was tilted towards the right hand side.

'For a split second I thought, "Is that real?", doubting myself,' he added.

The officer described to the court how skin from the child's face stuck to the final cover as he pulled it back.

He said the face was 'mouldy' and 'to me, it was mummified'.

Accused: Hutton, pictured at an earlier hearing, denies killing her son by starving him to death

Sgt Dove said he was struck by the right hand of the body. 'It was a bit like a stump, like a fibrous stump - dried out.'

The officer told the court he was 'transfixed' at that point by what he saw and felt he had to leave the house.

Sgt Dove also described the terrible state of the house before he made his grim discovery.

He said there was a smell he said was 'rubbish mixed with sweat mixed with urine' and rubbish piled everywhere.

The officer said he found beds soaked in urine but eventually became 'acclimatised' to the stench.

Hamzah's father, Aftab Khan, has told the court he confronted his ex-partner about their son's care, and tried to get social services involved.

The trial continues.
