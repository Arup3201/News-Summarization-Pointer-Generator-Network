A Queensland father has recounted the incredible tale of survival of his young family after being stranded in bushland for nearly two weeks when their car became bogged in mud. 

Stephen Van Lonkhuyzen, 37, and his boys Ethan, 7, and Timothy, 5, survived off mouldy bread and rainwater for ten days, before being found in their four-wheel drive at Expedition National Park  by local property owner Tom Wagner at about 3:30pm on Sunday.

‘We didn’t know for so long if anyone knew we were here or if was even looking,' said Mr Van Lonkhuyzen.

'The boys understood the situation, and that there was nothing they could do about it,' he told Nine News.

Mr Van Lonkhuyzen, from Lota, in central Queensland, said that the family made the best of the situation, rationing their supplies and catching rain water in a plastic bowl.

'We managed our water well and talked each other through it,' he said.

Mr Van Lonkhuyzen tried to get his sons into a 'routine', said South West District Acting Superintendent Mick Bianci.

'He actually set out some hi-viz towels, spread them out on the ground around vehicle so it could much more visible in case an air search took place,' Superintendent Bianci told The Courier Mail. 

'He lit a fire to put up some smoke to attract anyone who was out there and saw the smoke and he sent out SOSs on the horn of his vehicle, but of course it’s remote and isolated. There was no one to hear it,' he said.

A national alert went out after Mr Van Lonkhuyzen and his boys vanished after starting out on the 1700km Christmas holiday road trip from Brisbane to Cairns on December 11. 

They were expected to arrive in Cairns on December 15, but after Mr Van Lonkhuyzon failed to make contact with family or friends in over a week, his wife contacted police, who sent out a nationwide alert.

Mr Van Lonkhuyzon's wife Karen called the extensive search for her family 'a nightmare'.

Tom Wagner, a local farmer, heard about the missing family through a radio link with the Outback Church, and decided to pack up his quad bike and set out in search of them.  

The farmer said said that the family was incredibly relieved to see him, and started waving their arms around to get his attention

The family was in good cheer despite not eating for over a week, and were overjoyed when Mr Wagner returned with the police, who he had called from the nearest rangers hut

'I got on my quad and took some sandwiches and biscuits and a bit of food and water for them and headed out,' said Mr Wagner. 

Mr Wagner, a grazier at the mouth of Expedition National Park, said he knew the area 'like the back of his hand,' and calculated the possibly locations of the Lonkhuyzen family  based on how much petrol he was told they set out with.

'I talked to a national park fella and found out they’d been seen in Haughton on that first Friday, 10 days ago or whatever it was and no one had seen them since,' Mr Wagner told News Corp.  

The trio had last been seen at a petrol station at Miles, northwest of Toowoomba.

'With that I worked out how far they could get, that national park is 100,000 acres, it’s huge and terribly rough country, that’s pretty inaccessible,' he told News Corp.

After discovering fading tracks in the mud, Mr Wagner head further into the national park, and discovered the family after searching for four hours in 'the wildest bit of country in the whole area'.

The farmer said said that the family was incredibly relieved to see him, and started waving their arms around to get his attention.

'You suddenly hear a noise and you go, that’s the noise you’ve been waiting for,' Mr Van Lonkhuyzon said. 

'We were never worried- I know from the outside it was probably a far more distressing situation, not knowing anything, but we knew we were safe,' he said .

After producing the food he had brought along, the boys 'woofed' into the biscuits and sandwiches, asking for eggs and complaining about only having water to drink. 

'They were very close to running out of food when they were found and they had nine litres of water with them in the car that were used up,' Superintendent Bianci told The Courier Mail. 

Mr Wagner, who has been labelled a hero, said that the boys looked a bit 'thin in the face' but appeared to be in good cheer.

The farmer jumped on his bike again to find reception for his satellite phone, a move the young boys were none too happy about, believing he was going to leave them there.

'When we did get the police vehicle in we had to winch it through a bit, it was a bit of a hassle getting in through there,' he said. 

Detective Acting Superintendent Owen Elloy said Mr Van Lonkhuyzen said that police  arrived at the scene just after 5pm.

'It is a piece of land that is normally visited by cattle from what I can understand of it. It is black soil country, it's very soft,' Detective Elloy said. 

Despite a few technical glitches, Mr Lonkhuyzen, Ethan, and Timothy were rescued from their bogged four-wheel-drive, and taken to Taroom Hospital.

Detective Acting Superintendent Owen Elloy noted that the area in which the trio were found was well known for its rugged terrain and deep gorges, saying that even the property owner that found them 'went in there with a huge air of concern – he had his satellite phone with him, thank god'

Detective Elloy also added: 'They had the common sense to stay with their vehicle which is a huge point in any survival technique. They've stayed with their car and it's a lot easier to find a car than somebody walking.'

He noted that the area was well known for its rugged terrain and deep gorges, saying, 'even the property owner went in there with a huge air of concern – he had his satellite phone with him, thank god.' 

Mr Van Lonkhuyzen's brother, Derrick, said that the family was excited to have them home for Christmas.

'They will be certainly looking forward to coming home and we are certainly looking forward to having them home,' he said.
