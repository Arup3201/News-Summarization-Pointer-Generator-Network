Marine Le Pen dealt Nicolas Sarkozy a major blow last night by declaring he had ‘lost’ the election and refusing to tell her supporters to back him.

The French president’s hopes of clinging to power rely on picking up the votes of many of the six million who backed Miss Le Pen’s National Front in record numbers in the first round of the national poll.

The strong showing for the Far Right party triggered alarm around Europe, while the prospect of Mr Sarkozy losing to socialist opponent Francois Hollande in the second round spooked financial markets.

Fighting for his political life: Nicolas Sarkozy, pictured in Paris yesterday, must win over voters on the far right if he is to avoid defeat in the presidential run-off

Towering strength: Marine Le Penn  yesterday dealt Sarkozy a major blow by declaring that he lost the election. She refused to support him in the run-off

Economists fear Mr Hollande will unpick a Brussels deal on fiscal union and shatter an uneasy consensus on the need for austerity measures across the Continent.

The political uncertainty in France, the world’s fifth largest economy, helped trigger a sell-off on both sides of the Atlantic. The French stock market fell by 2.83 per cent, Germany’s by 3.36 per cent and London’s by 1.85 per cent.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday expressed shock that nearly 20 per cent of French voters had gone for the National Front. The alliance between Berlin and Paris is key to the European project.

Defeat for Mr Sarkozy on May 6 would also be awkward for David Cameron, who broke with convention by publicly endorsing the French president.

Government sources said efforts would be made to extend an olive branch to the French socialists, with Europe Minister David Lidington expected to be tasked with trying to strengthen links.

‘They are political allies,’ a Downing Street source said of Mr Sarkozy and Mr Cameron, defending the Prime Minister’s decision to back the French president. ‘But of course, if Hollande ends up winning we will have to work with him.’

Miss Le Pen’s party won 18 per cent of the vote, its largest ever share, in Sunday’s first round, but yesterday her party said there would be no deal with the current president.

She said: ‘I don’t expect anything except that the system will implode,’ adding: ‘Sarkozy has already lost the presidential election.’ Bruno Bilde, Miss Le Pen’s senior aide, said: ‘There has to be reorganisation of French political life.

‘It’s therefore out of the question for the National Front candidate to negotiate … or to offer her vote in favour of Nicolas Sarkozy or Francois Hollande. Marine Le Pen is convinced of that.’

Salute: Marine Le Pen, National Front Party Candidate took third place in the first round of the votes

A National Front spokesman said: ‘We 
shall be abstaining, because we do not want to give a green light to any
 of the two candidates, because they are the same’.

Opinion
 polls have suggested that up to six in ten Le Pen voters could back Mr 
Sarkozy in the second round. Mr Hollande won 28.6 per cent and Sarkozy 
took 27 per cent on Sunday.

Mr Hollande is now the favourite to win. If he does, he would become France’s first socialist leader in 17 years.

Both
 contenders tried to tack to the right to try to appeal to voters who 
had backed Miss Le Pen. Speaking at a rally in central France, Mr 
Sarkozy said he ‘had heard’ Le Pen’s message and vowed to be tough on 
immigration.

He said: 
‘National Front voters must be respected. They voiced their view. It was
 a vote of suffering, a crisis vote. Why insult them? This anxiety, this
 suffering, I know them, I understand them.

‘They
 concern our borders, outsourcing, control of immigration, work, 
security, for them and their families. I know that in this fast-moving 
world, the concern of our patriots to preserve their way of life is the 
key issue in this election.’

In Brittany, Mr Hollande said: ‘My message? We are a large country and we will recover – we have no need of divisions.’

Pierre
 Moscovici, his campaign director, said the Socialist candidate would 
continue to be ‘very open’ to legal immigration, but ‘we must fight with
 absolute firmness, without concession, against illegal immigration’.

Far
 Left candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon, who came fourth with almost 12 per 
cent of the vote, has told his supporters to back Mr Hollande.

In 2007 Nicolas Sarkozy inspired voters with pledges to break with the past and make France a more dynamic economy.

But after an initial wave of reforms, his momentum fizzled.

His stormy personal life got in the way: he divorced months into office, then quickly married former supermodel Carla Bruni, and became seen as a bling-bling president more concerned with pleasing his super-rich friends than serving the public.

He enjoyed a string of foreign policy successes, improving relations with the United States and Israel, leading an international airstrike campaign in Libya and rallying European partners to stem Europe's financial crisis.

But voters at home felt forgotten and hurt by a presidency that included France's worst recession since World War II.

Francois Hollande, despite a bland persona and few eye-catching campaign ideas, has been more popular than Sarkozy for months.

Sarkozy showed signs of a possible comeback once he hit the campaign trail. The shooting rampage in southern France also gave him a platform to appear presidential and project the tough guy image that helped launch him to national prominence.

But in recent days his support has lagged again. The last polls before the election, released on Friday, showed Sarkozy slipping a few points behind Hollande in the first round - and a crushing 10 to 15 points away from victory in the runoff.
