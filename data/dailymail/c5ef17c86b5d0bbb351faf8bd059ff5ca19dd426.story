Australians face a daunting 36-hours ahead of Tuesday's Federal Budget with 16,000 jobs set to be slashed and the Royal Australian Mint sold.

About 76 government run agencies will be either sold, consolidated or scrapped.

The Australian Newspaper today reported about 31 smaller agencies will go, 11 will be merged and nine bigger departments will fold completely.

'A more prosperous Australia' Treasurer Joe Hockey has declared Tuesday's budget will benefit all Australians in the long run, despite short-term pain

Five departments, including the Royal Australian Mint, will be sold-off.

The initial forecasted job cuts of 12,000 has since been revised and it looks as if that number will be closer to 16,000.

Treasurer Joe Hockey has assured Australians it is all part of a cost-savings measure to help get the budget back into the black by 2024.

Mr Hockey said: 'It is a budget that asks the Australian people to contribute to a stronger Australian economy, a more prosperous Australia with more jobs and a greater sense of security,'

Savings of more than $470 million will be made by the winding back, sale and scrapping of jobs and government agencies.

The Royal Australian Mint (pictured) will be sold, as will a number of key government agencies in a bid to get Australia's budget back in to surplus by 2024

If it goes through, the sale of the  Defence Housing Australia would raise $1 billion and other assets, including the mint, would provide millions more.

Economists are tipping this to be the toughest budget ever released - certainly the toughest since the first under former Prime Minister John Howard in 1996.

Separate studies and audits have recommended sweeping changes, including the Commission Of Audit, which recommended across-the-board reforms.

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said all workers will need to brace themselves for the changes ahead.

'This is not a matter of targeting one area of government more than another.'

'We are very systematic and very methodical in going right across government.'

His department undertook a separate study last year which identified about 937 bodies and 'governance relationships', such as committees, that were under government control.

This is despite the majority of workers being employed in only about 100 of government agencies.

Treasurer Hockey has therefore made a commitment to winding back the public service and putting the government's efforts into improving its most important sectors.

'You can have lots of small programs that involve a massive amount of red tape with very little outcome,' Mr Hockey said.

'What we’ve got to do is refocus the energy of the public sector in Canberra.'

Australian unions have gone on the front foot in support of public sector workers.

The Community and Public Service Union conducted a poll of more than 5820 staff from fifty different Commonwealth agencies recently, regarding government worker cuts.

It revealed 70 per cent of respondents reported job cuts in their workplace over the past year while 87 per cent reported understaffing and unfilled positions.

CPSU National Secretary Nadine Flood said the survey shows the damage being done to public services and highlights the risks if the government continues to pursue cuts.  'The very clear message we are getting from workers at the coalface is that ongoing cuts are putting the public service under unsustainable pressure,' she said.'The Government can pretend it can make cuts without hurting services, but this survey shows that is simply not true.'

ACTU President Ged Kearney said: 'It’s not in Australia’s interest to implement savage cuts to health, education, pensions, welfare and public sector jobs, while at the same time dropping the baton on training, investment and vital job creation.'

Mr Kearney said everything he has heard ahead of tomorrow's announcement spells disaster for hard working Australians.

'They’re (Australians) worried their kids won’t be able to go to university and about vanishing job and training opportunities for young people.'

'Everything coming from the Abbott Government so far indicates that budget 2014 will make it harder for Australian families and workers to make ends meet.'

The budget will be released at 7.30pm Tuesday.
