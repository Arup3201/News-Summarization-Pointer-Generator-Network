It's one of the most unique and deeply personal experiences you'll ever have; a private moment where time and vanity disappear in a haze of pain and euphoria.

For those reasons perhaps, few of us would be willing to share it with the world. But Zoe Simpson, a 35-year-old former nursery nurse and mother-of-one, feels completely different.

For Ms Simpson is one of the stars of cult Channel 4 series One Born Every Minute and says that giving birth in front of the TV cameras was one of the proudest moments of her life.

Although the presence of the cameras would suggest the opposite, Zoe is no exhibitionist desperate for her 15 minutes of fame.

Instead, her appearance on the show was the culmination of a seven-year battle against infertility and her daughter, 6lb 12oz Dana Ivy Frances Cook, the much-longed for result.

'My partner and I started talking about [going on the show] and we decided we should have her birth filmed,' explains Zoe.

'We thought, "she's probably going to be the only baby we ever have, so wouldn't it be nice?"'

Filming itself proved easy and Zoe says the experience of working with documentary makers was 'fantastic'.

'We got a continuity of care with the 
producers,' she explains. 'Every time I went for a scan or a consultation, they were there.

'We built a 
friendship up with them, so when we were doing the interviews, it didn't 
feel like a film crew. Even though there was a massive camera in my face, it felt like we were doing it with friends.'

Zoe's road to motherhood began seven years ago, when, at the age of 28, she and her partner Anthony Cook decided to start trying for a baby.

After two fruitless years of trying, the couple visited the doctor to find out what had gone wrong.

'Anthony was fine,' remembers Zoe. 'It [infertility] was down to me.'

Discovering that she had endometriosis, a condition that results in womb tissue growing in other parts of the body, was a devastating blow.

'I
 didn't know too much about it to begin with,' she explains. 'I'd always had heavy and painful periods 
but I thought it was just one of those things.

'I suppose 
my heart sort of sank, and then it got worse because I went and Googled it and read that people who 
have it often have polycystic ovaries too.'

Luckily for Zoe, her worst fears proved 
unfounded and doctors were able to cut the endometrioisis away before giving 
her drugs to turbo-charge her ovaries.

Worth it: Despite the trials and tribulations, Zoe says she would do everything again if she had to

Endometriosis is a common condition where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb (the endometrium) appears in other parts of the body.Although they can be found anywhere, most occur on the ovaries, on the lining of the pelvis behind the uterus and the top of the vagina.

According to the NHS, the condition affects around two million women in the UK. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40.Symptoms include painful or heavy periods, and pain in the lower stomach, back and pelvis. A lack of energy, fertility problems and depression are often linked to it.

'They put me on clomid but that didn't 
work either so eventually, we spoke to a consultant who put us on a IUI [Intrauterine insemination] treatment. That 
was very invasive; I had injections through the stomach every day and there were a lot of nasal sprays.'

Despite their best efforts, the first round of IUI treatment was a failure. 'It was most gut-wrenching 
thing I've ever been through,' says Zoe.

'It was soul-destroying and I wasn't sure 
whether to do it again. It put a real strain on my relationship too.'

The couple chose to persevere and on the 16th January 2013, discovered that she was expecting - 'the best feeling ever', says Zoe.

Her elation continued as she enjoyed a 'lovely pregnancy' with no morning sickness and the unexpected bonus of wonderfully thick glossy hair.

But despite her joy, the road to motherhood proved bumpy once more and she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.

'I knew more about it 
[than the endometriosis] and I wasn't too worried to begin with but as the weeks went on, the tablets I was given stopped providing my body with enough support. They put me on insulin and that did frighten me a bit.'Â

Best moment: Zoe with Dana in her arms a few moments after giving birth to her

By the time she went into labour, Zoe was a veteran of multiple hospital visits but admits, as a first time mother, to having some qualms about giving birth.

'My sister and 
all their friends have had babies and I've heard all the horror stories but
 I had extra worries about going into labour because of all the problems,' she reveals.

'I didn't 
want an epidural,' she adds.

'I wanted to go au naturel but as you'll see [in the show] that didn't happen.'

Despite being able to hear the cameras whirring behind the walls, Zoe says her televised birth was a 'fantastic experience' and hopes baby Dana will one day see the tape.

'It is a really private, intimate
 moment but watching One Born Every Minute, I've always thought what a lovely thing it is to share and what a lovely
 moment it is.

'Going into labour, there's so much 
going on that you forget about them. They're tiny so you do forget they're there.'

She adds: 'I wasn't 
very worried about being filmed in labour. It can be a bit gory but not
 a lot of people tune in to see the bits.

'It's more informative and I cry every time I watch it. Without these programmes, women who don't have children don't get
 to see or hear about these experiences.

'I don't mind that 
it's out there. It's a moment that I'm proud of. I'm proud of what I 
achieved with her [Dana] and I want to show her off.

'I get to keep that moment for the 
rest of my life.'

One Born Every Minute, tonight at 9pm on Channel 4. Zoe appears in episode four.
