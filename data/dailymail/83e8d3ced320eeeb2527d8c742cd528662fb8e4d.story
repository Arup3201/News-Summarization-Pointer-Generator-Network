A mother who was looking over photographs of a family day out was left shocked after discovering the face of a 'ghost child' next to her children climbing a tree.

Michelle Mason from Stoke-on-Trent, had taken the picture in August of two of her children while on a family outing to Cannock Chase in Staffordshire.

While on the trip, the mother-of-three stopped to snap an image of her two children Sophia and Lee, who were climbing a tree.

But after looking back over the picture she discovered the figure of what appears to be a Victorian child.

Mrs Mason, 39, explained: 'We were on a family walk one afternoon and the kids decided to climb a tree. 

'I stopped to take a photo but it wasn’t until I got home that I spotted a child’s face looking back at me.

'I couldn’t believe it when I looked closer at the picture and there was a child, standing with a wheel or a hoop in their hand. 

Michelle Mason, who says she has discovered the face of a 'ghost child' in a family photo 

'It has really freaked me out. I don’t like anything like that.

'I would love to know more about the child in the picture. I am convinced it is a ghost, possibly from the Victorian times.

'When you look closely at the photo you can see the deep dark eyes. It definitely bares a striking resemblance to the black-eyed child that has been spotted around Cannock Chase.

'I don’t think it looks evil though, or like it wants to cause any harm to my children. They were both a bit spooked by it at first, but any child would be.'

Now Mrs Mason is keen to find out more about the history of Cannock Chase in a bid to reveal who the 'ghost child' might be.

She explained: 'I would love to find out more about the history of that area and if there are any experts who can help me out. It is a fascinating subject.

'I have had a lot of feedback from people, and it is split pretty evenly between people thinking it is a little boy or a little girl.

'Different people have spotted different things, such as a hand holding a hoop or a stick. Everyone sees differently I think depending on what they believe.'

The full-time carer, added: 'Some people have said that I must have used Photoshop but I couldn’t tell you the first thing about that, I have no idea how to use anything like that. I just took the photo on our family compact camera.

'But that is most likely just people who are sceptical or don’t believe in the afterlife, that is always the first thing they say.'
