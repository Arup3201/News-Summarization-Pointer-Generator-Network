Actress Sofia Escobar decided to confront her Twitter critic when she discovered the offending tweet

A West End leading lady was so enraged by the online criticism of a suburban housewife she's embarked on a bitter Twitter battle that's ended up with both parties accusing the other of cyber bullying.

Actress Sofia Escobar, who plays Christina in Phantom Of the Opera, snapped after discovering the 48-year-old from Twickenham had sent her friend a tweet that read: 'Ah but u know I can’t stand Sofia…'

Miss Escobar, 27, and her actor boyfriend then bombarded the fan with angry public messages.

Incredibly, the tweet was not tagged or direct messaged to Escobar’s Twitter account.

So the only way the Portuguese-born 
performer, 27, could have seen it was by searching out her name on 
Twitter - or if the message was brought to her attention by someone who 
had done so.

A day after 
the initial message, the housewife, who has asked to remain anonymous, 
but tweets under the name SHkiyolove, then received a tweet from Escobar
reading: 'It’s ok cause I can’t stand you either ;) x'

Escobar’s boyfriend, Spanish actor 
Gonzalo Ramos then weighed in, tweeting: 'Lack of taste is ok, lack of 
education is just sad, something to think about cause u’ve already got 
some years behind u.'

The housewife immediately apologised - but she was then accused of cyber-bullying by Escobar, a former Guildhall pupil who has played Christine at Her Majesty’s Theatre for two years.

The actress wrote: 'I take criticism very well. But one thing is to criticise and one v different is to be offensive, disrespectful and mean. To me, "I don’t like her portrayal" sounds v dif to "I can’t stand her’".'

The tweet that provoked Miss Escobar's ire

Miss Escobar responded to her critic's tweet with a direct message

The actress then wrote a string of angry tweets in response

The ranting continued, with a tweet which read: 'Just because I’m a performer that gives people the right to insult me without me being able to defend myself? I don’t think so.'

And it went on: 'My job doesn’t make me super human and respect goes down well no matter what profession people have. And I won’t be insulted and not stand up for myself. Just because I’m a performer it doesn’t give you a free pass to bullying.'

The housewife also received a series of insulting tweets from Escobar’s fans. Today she said that the actress should have had a thicker skin: 'How can you get angry over such a stupid comment? It’s laughable.

'I can understand actors hating anything negative written about them, but to take it on a personal level like this? And against a mere punter like myself who only expressed her honest opinion as a theatre lover?

'She has accused me of cyber-bullying but many people have now said to me that they think she is the one who is the cyber-bully.'

A spokesman for the musical and Escobar declined to comment.
