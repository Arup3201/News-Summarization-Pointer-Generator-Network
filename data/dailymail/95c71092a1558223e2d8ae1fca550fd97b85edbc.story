Liverpool midfielder Luis Alberto has joined Malaga on a season-loan after struggling to make an impact in his first year at Anfield.

The 21-year-old made just two starts and 10 substitute appearances after an £8million move from Sevilla last summer but manager Brendan Rodgers is not prepared to give up on the youngster just yet and hopes he will gain more first-team experience with the Spanish club.

A Liverpool statement read: 'Liverpool today confirmed that midfielder Luis Alberto has completed a season-long loan switch to Spanish outfit Malaga.

'The 21-year-old, who arrived at Anfield from Sevilla last summer, will spend the entirety of 2014-15 with the side that finished 11th last season.'

Rodgers is still trying to add to his summer signings of England and Southampton striker Rickie Lambert and Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Emre Can but appears to have failed in the bid to sign Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno after the sides failed to agree a fee.

The Europa League winner, 21, has been tracked for some time and although negotiations were lengthy the two have been 'miles apart' on their valuations of the player with the Spaniards looking for £20million.

'The matter of Alberto is practically settled. We couldn't reach an agreement and I don't think it can be revived,' Sevilla's sporting director Monchi told Spanish newspaper El Correo de Andalucia.

'It was great offer but the player is only 21 years old and it's possible that the catharsis of being with the national team had a positive effect.

'He has a lot of room to grow and the coach is very happy to have him.

Experience: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers hopes Alberto gets game time at Malaga

'I don't think we'll make a lot of moves but if on August 14 a club comes along and they give you a mountain of cash, well....I know you don't like to hear it, but we are economic managers.

'My feeling is that the negotiations are paralysed and I don't see any hint that they will be restarted.

'We put a price on our players which we believe to be appropriate. Whoever wants to buy, can buy, and if you can't....

'Also, with the sale of Ivan Rakitic (to Barcelona) our needs were covered. We don't have the (financial) burden we had at other times.'
