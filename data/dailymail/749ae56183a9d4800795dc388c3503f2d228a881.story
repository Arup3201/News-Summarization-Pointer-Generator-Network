Reeva Steenkamp never had sex with Oscar Pistorius during their three-month relationship and was about to leave the disgraced athlete on the night he shot her dead, her mother has claimed.

Pistorius previously told his murder trial that the couple were planning a life together, but June Steenkamp says she has 'no doubt in her mind' that her daughter wanted to end their romance. 

Mrs Steenkamp also believes the model refused to sleep with the Paralympian because she had 'nagging doubts about their compatibility'.

'They'd shared a bed, but she was scared to take the relationship to that level … She wouldn't want to sleep with Oscar if she wasn't sure,' she said in an interview with The Times Magazine yesterday.

June Steenkamp, pictured with her husband, thinks Reeva had 'nagging doubts' about her compatibility with Pistorius before she was shot dead

She said: 'I believe their relationship was coming to an end. In her heart of hearts, she didn't think it was making either of them happy.' 

In her book, titled Reeva: A Mother's Story, Mrs Steenkamp describes Pistorius, 27, as a 'pathetic figure'. 

She writes in her book: 'Her clothes were packed. There is no doubt in our minds: she had decided to leave Oscar that night.

'It was Reeva's bad luck that she met him, because sooner or later he would have killed someone. I do believe that.'

They have sat through an agonising seven-month trial, but June and her husband Barry said justice for their daughter Reeva, 29, has not been served as the 'Blade Runner' could be out in 10 months.

Mrs Steenkamp, 68, said she did not believe the athlete's story, describing him as 'vague, evasive and shifty' after he claimed  he shot Reeva thinking she was an intruder. 

In a separate extract serialised in The Times2 Magazine today, Mrs Steenkamp describes her shock and disbelief when the judge found him not guilty of murder.

'My heart continued to beat, but I didn't feel alive,' she wrote.

'It was the worst of double whammies - to lose our daughter and then to see her violent death deemed an accident.' 

She also told how her husband Barry suffered a stroke one morning after breakfast while reading a newspaper article about their daughter's death two months after she was shot.

She said: 'He became delirious. He couldn't speak and one side of his face collapsed. We rushed him to the doctor, who discovered a blood clot on his brain.' 

But she says she has 'forgiven him in the Christian sense', adding that she didn't want to 'carry poison in my body'.

She also has 'no hate in my heart' for the athlete's family, whom she says were 'in as much pain as I am.' 

The couple are both are haunted by a recurring image of Reeva, terrified and alone in the small toilet cubicle, pleading for her life or screaming in agony once she had been shot.  

Another extract from Mrs Steenkamp's book focuses on the athlete's public apology during the televised trial.

'It was an extraordinary moment. You could cut the atmosphere in the courtroom with a knife: silence, but for the sound of journalists tapping on their screens. It put me in an awkward position.

'Why decide to say sorry to me in a televised trial in front of the whole world? I was unmoved by his apology. 

'I felt if I appeared to be sorry for him at this stage of his trial on the charge of premeditated murder, it would in the eyes of others lessen the awfulness of what he had done.

'He was in the box trying to save his own skin after he had killed my daughter and I was sitting in that courtroom wanting to hear the factual truth.'

Pistorius told the court they were planning a life together, but Mrs Steenkamp thinks Reeva had 'nagging doubts about their compatibility'

Miss Steenkamp's parents said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, and 'only Oscar knows' the truth

The five-year sentence given to the double amputee athlete has been criticised by some as too lenient.

But Miss Steenkamp's parents told ITV's Good Morning Britain they accepted the sentence and 'don't want revenge'.

They said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, and 'only Oscar knows' the truth.

Judge Thokozile Masipa ruled the state had failed to prove Pistorius knew it was Reeva when he opened fire through the locked toilet door of his apartment in Pretoria. 

Throughout the trial, he said he mistook his girlfriend of three months for an intruder.

'He said pulling the trigger was 'an accident'. What? Four times an accident?' Mrs Steenkamp said in her book.

'He said Reeva did not scream, but she would definitely have screamed. I know my daughter and she was very vocal.'

Pistorius, who the court heard has no income and no property after selling it during the trial, was driven away in a police van with barred windows after his sentencing on Tuesday.

He is being held in the hospital section of a prison in Pretoria.

Mrs Steenkamp's book is to be published on November 6.
