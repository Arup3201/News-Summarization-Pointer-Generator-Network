Our insatiable desire to have the latest and greatest gadgets is causing landfills around the world to overflow with unwanted electronics.

Last year consumers from around the world threw away 48.9million tonnes of electrical and electronic goods, and this figure is set to rise by a third by the end of 2017.

This would mean the number of fridges, TVs, mobile phones, tablets, computers and other electrical products being thrown away could fill a line of 40-tonne trucks stretching three quarters of the way around the Equator - or 18,600 miles.

By the end of 2017, the amount of e-waste produced globally will be 11 times the weight of 200 Empire State Buildings. This interactive map, compares the waste produced by 184 countries. Differing shades of grey indicate the different countries analysed

China put 11million tonnes of  electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) on to the market and produced 7.2million tonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 11lbs per person.

The U.S put 9.9million tonnes of EEE on to the market, and produced 9.4million tonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 63lbs per person.

The UK put 1.6 million tonnes of EEE on to the market, and produced 1.3million tonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 46lbs per person.

Qatar put 5million tonnes EEE on to the market in 2012 and produced 1.1million tonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 139lbs per person.

This is the equivalent of 11 times the weight of the Pyramid of Giza or 200 Empire State Buildings.

The forecast has been made by the Solving the E-Waste Problem (StEP) Initiative - a partnership of UN organisations, industry, governments, non-government and science organisations.

The initiative has created an interactive map that compares the amount of e-waste produced by 184 countries, as well as how much electrical and electronic equipment, or EEE, each country makes. 

The map shows, that almost 48.9million tonnes of used electrical and electronic products were produced last year.

This works out at approximately 15lbs per person across the entire globe.

Based on current trends, StEP experts predict that by 2017 the total volume will be 33 per cent higher at 65.4million tonnes.

Qatar put 57 metric kilotonnes of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) on to the market in 2012. The country produced 116 metric kilotonnes of e-waste, which worked out at 139lbs per person. Whereas the UK put 1.6 metric kilotonnes of EEE on to the market and produced 1.3 metric kilotonnes of e-waste

Research recently found that people in the UK  binning 17 million gadgets worth £762million every year.

consoles, satnavs, MP3s and digital cameras, according to phone operator

According to SquareTrade, 1.2million people have never taken their electronic gift out of the box and one million people admitted to re-gifting a present to someone else.

One in ten (9 per cent) have damaged or broken a device they received for Christmas by New Year's Day.

Around 900,000 people have sold an electronic gift on eBay, or to a friend.

Nearly 600,000 people have returned or exchanged an electronic gift they received.

'Although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods, the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem,’ said Ruediger Kuehr of United Nations University and Executive Secretary of the StEP Initiative.

‘We believe that this constantly updated, map-linked database showing e-waste volume by country together with legal texts will help lead to better awareness and policy making at the public and private levels.'

The StEP e-waste world map database shows that in 2012 China and the U.S. topped the world’s totals in the amount of EEE and e-waste combined.

China put 11.1million tonnes of EEE on the market in 2012, followed by the U.S. with 10million tonnes.

When it came to e-waste generated last year, the U.S. had the world’s highest figure of 9.4million tonnes and China generated the second highest e-waste total of 7.3millon tonnes.

The UK put 1.6million tonnes of EEE on the market in 2012, and produced 1.3millon tonnes of e-waste.

The data also found that each American was responsible for an average 65lbs of hi-tech trash, which was almost six times higher than China’s per capita figure of 11lbs.

The UK produced 48lbs per inhabitant, while Qatar produced the most per person, however, with a staggering 139lbs per person.
