An Australian man who plunged to his death while being lifted into a rescue helicopter weighed up to 22 stone, it has been reported.

Robert Davis, a keen deer hunter from Sydney, fell 100ft and died on impact as he was being helped in through the doorway of the hovering helicopter.

Paramedics believe weight could have played a role in the tragic accident which occurred after the 68 year-old broken his ankle while on the bush in Melbourne and called for help.

Tragedy: Paramedics believe Mr Davis's weight could have played a role in the accident

A paramedic who was lowered down to Mr Davis, attached him to what is known as a strop hoist and he and the medic were winched up to the helicopter in vertical positions.

But it was as Mr Davis was being helped in through the doorway that he fell. The paramedic was immediately lowered back down but the patient could not be resuscitated.

Police, ambulance and government officials have now begun an investigation into what went wrong, including suggestions that Mr Davis' weight and size might have played an unfortunate part in his tragic death.

People at the scene in Melbourne have characterised Mr Davis as a likeable man

Members of Mr Davis' family said last night that they were too shocked to talk about the incident. And ambulance officials said the crew were also struggling to come to terms with what had happened.

Mr Davis, from Riverwood, Sydney, had been trekking through thick bushland near Lake Eildon with a friend when he broke his ankle. It was impossible for him to walk to safety, so help was called in.

A taxidermist in the small town of Mansfield, closest to the scene of the tragedy, told Melbourne's Herald Sun that Mr Davis was 'a likeable sort of guy'.

'He loved coming down here. It's not even so much for the hunting side of it,' said Peter Anthony.

'They probably sit around and have a few beers and a wine, have a chat and talk about deer hunting and catch up with a few of the other guys they have meet over the years,' he said.

Denis Napthine, state premier of Victoria, said a full inquiry would be carried out, including an examination by the Coroner, police, Ambulance Victoria and the Civil Aviation Authority.

'Our hearts go out to the family of the deceased and, of course, we also put our arms around the Ambulance Victoria officers who were working so hard to try and rescue that person and who will be absolutely devastated.'

The officer who was winched with Mr Davis is a veteran of the rescue crew and one of Victoria's best paramedics.

A colleague who said the tragedy had rocked Victoria's 40 specialist crew members added: 'Our hearts go out to the family'. 

Referring to Mr Davis, the colleague said: 'He just got to the door and he fell.

'I don't know whether he came out of the harness or what, but this gear is pretty good.' 

Ambulance Victoria CEO, Greg Sassella, told the same newspaper that such operations were high risk.
