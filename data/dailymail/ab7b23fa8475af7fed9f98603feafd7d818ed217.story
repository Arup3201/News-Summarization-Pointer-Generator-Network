A German jihadist who was caught with watches from Aldi, chocolate and novels for ISIS extremists will face trial next week.

Former KFC worker Ismail Issa, 24, was arrested by authorities in Stuttgart, Germany, when he was found running errands to buy supplies for comrades in Syria. 

This included watches from the budget supermarket chain, medicine and night-vision gear.

Issa, born in Lebanon, was radicalised in Stuttgart and initially went to Syria to fight for the overthrow of the Assad regime. 

He later joined the ranks of ISIS who gave him a wish-list of items to buy for them during a return to the city.  

They wanted four sports watches from Aldi costing €28 each, 10 pairs of combat trousers from an online US Army shop at €189.90 each and night-vision gear from a Stuttgart hunting shop costing more than 4,000 euros. 

Chocolate, medicine and novels were also on the wish-list. 

Officers from the German intelligence service, the BND, monitored him upon his return to Germany following an anonymous tip-off. 

He was travelling in a car through Europe back to Syria in November last year when police pulled him over at an autobahn service station and found his shopping.

He still had his ISIS shopping list with the names of ten comrades and their waist and leg measurements.

The items on the extremists' wish-list for Issa included four sports watches from Aldi supermarket

Mohammed Sobhan, a 28-year-old Afghani was arrested with him, who police say was recruited by Issa.

Both men and Issa's brother Ezzedine, 33, go on trial on November 5 charged with supporting terrorism. 

The indictment against all three is 81 pages long and has many details about Issa's radicalisation as well as the structures and organisation of ISIS.

It says how he was raised with five siblings by his mother and had a chaotic upbringing. He left school at 17, held temporary jobs and married his girlfriend who was pregnant and moved to Sweden.

The couple split when the pregnancy failed and by 2010, Issa returned to his mother in Stuttgart and began working at a KFC. 

He tried to return to school, but instead turned to drugs and soon became radicalised in Stuttgart. 

In late 2012, he flew to Syria and ended up joining the ranks of ISIS but after he was wounded in battle and deemed a 'little bit useless', he returned to Germany to pick up the supplies.    

In Germany, more than 450 people have left the country for Syria since the fighting began and about 130 have returned, security officials said. About 25 are believed to have battlefield experience. 

Prosecutors said they had begun more than 140 investigations related to Islamic extremism, often involving more than one suspect.

Under German law, no pleas are entered until trial.

Issa has been held in a state prison since his arrest. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison, the maximum under German law.
