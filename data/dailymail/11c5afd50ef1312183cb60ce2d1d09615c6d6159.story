The career of one of the of the U.S. Navy's most experienced pilots may be sunk after his affair with a petty officer was revealed.

Captain Jeffrey 'Chilly' Winter was the top pilot aboard the USS Carl Vinson, but was removed from his command on September 20 after Navy officials learned of his affair with the air wing's medical officer.

Removal from a command post in the Navy generally is a career-ending moment.

Winter's extracurricular activities with his subordinate only was revealed after the wife of a petty officer looked through files on a portable hard-drive her husband had brought home from work.

The petty officer's wife told Navy investigators that she began snooping around her husband's hard-drive because she was 'extremely suspicious of her husband's activities on exercises and deployments due to past marital issues.'

But the affair she discovered wasn't her husband's - it was that of his boss.

In one of several emails released by the Navy under the Freedom of Information Act - first obtained by the San Diego Union-Tribune - Winter writes to his unidentified mistress, 'I was obviously missing the passionate, no-holds-barred aspects of my nature when I met you. You brought it alive in me.'

He signed the email 'I love you a lot. Xoxoxo.'

In the emails Winter refers to the woman as 'Sugar.' According to an investigative report regarding the affair - in which the woman's name is redacted - 'Sugar' has since left the service.

When questioned by Navy investigators, Winter did not deny the affair, and said it started in February of 2012, when he was a deputy wing commander.

Winter told investigators that the affair ended in June of this year.

In another email, Winter and 'Sugar' speak fondly of a stop in Perth, Australia, where the Vinson stopped for five days in April of 2012 in the middle of a six-month deployment.

In one email, written in June, 'Sugar' wrote to Winter's Navy email account, 'I love you and miss you incredibly.'

Winter is described in the report as a 'geographic bachelor' - he visited with his wife and family on weekends while stationed in California's Central Valley.

Burial at sea: After he was killed by Navy SEALs, Osama bin Laden's body was taken to the Vinson for identification and burial at sea

The Vinson is one of the Navy's most prized possessions. It is widely believed to be the ship used to dump the body of terror mastermind Osama bin Laden into the Indian Ocean after he was killed by U.S. Navy SEALs in Pakistan in 2011. It also was sent to Haiti to assist in the country's recovery from the devastating 2010 earthquake.

On the ship's Facebook page, it adamantly declares, 'loose lips sink ships.'

Winter has logged more than 4,000 hours of air combat duty since he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1989. He as more than 800 successful carrier landings and served as instructor at the Navy's famed TOP GUN fighter pilot school in San Diego.

After his removal from command aboard the Vinson, Winter has been found guilty of fraternization and adultery, both of which are crimes in the military justice system.

At an October 4 administrative hearing, Winter was hit with a letter of reprimand, with a Navy official saying that further action was pending.

Winter is just one of 20 Navy commanding officers to be removed from their post this year. Navy officials say they are publicizing these types of indiscretions in an attempt to hold officers to a higher standard.
