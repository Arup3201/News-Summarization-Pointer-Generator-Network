An angry jilted husband shot dead his unarmed ex-wife outside a Hilton hotel where she had been staying with her new boyfriend, a court heard.

Jerry Hudson, 51, of Bolingbrook, Illinois, allegedly murdered Melissa Bridgewater outside the $240-a-night hotel on New Year’s Day in 2010.

He phoned her 20 times in the 90 minutes before her death, rammed her car and shot her six times - with two bullets in the head, prosecutors said.

Charged: Jerry Hudson, 51, of Bolingbrook, Illinois, allegedly murdered Melissa Bridgewater, 45, outside a hotel near Chicago on New Year's Day in 2010

‘This is not a case of who done it,’ John Lyke Jr, defending, told DuPage County Court, arguing self-defence. ‘This is a case of why did he do it.’

The shooting happened more than two years ago at 6:20am in the car park of the DoubleTree Hilton Hotel in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook.

Hudson allegedly hit her vehicle with his Hyundai rental car to stop her leaving, after making the phone calls, reported the Chicago Sun-Times.

He shot the 45-year-old six times and drove off but a picture of his car was snapped by a nearby toll camera, Mary Cronin, prosecuting, told the court.

Hudson claims he shot when he thought she was reaching to pull out a pistol inside her Acura car. But no gun was found in the vehicle.

However he claimed she owned a handgun and had previously told him she ‘wasn’t afraid to use it’, Mr Lyke told the court.

He had left a letter at home saying he was angry Ms Bridgewater, who divorced him in 2006, did not want to get back together, Ms Cronin said.

The couple still dated despite their divorce and Hudson was humiliated when he found out she was with someone else, prosecutors said.

‘Melissa took my manhood, so I’m taking her with me,’ the letter allegedly said. Hudson surrendered to police four days after the shooting.

'If she took his manhood, it’s a petty theft. Not one that warranted six bullet holes'

Mary Cronin, prosecuting

‘If she took his manhood, it’s a petty theft,’ Ms Cronin said, reported the Chicago Tribune. ‘Not one that warranted six bullet holes.’

Ms Bridgewater was celebrating New Year’s at the hotel with her boyfriend Marvin Durr, who was also marking his birthday, the court heard.

The top rate for a two-person bedroom at the hotel for New Year's Eve this year is $510 including tax, but rates are up to $240 for a normal day.

Hudson, a former truck driver, is charged with first-degree murder. The case continues on Thursday in front of Judge Daniel Guerin.
