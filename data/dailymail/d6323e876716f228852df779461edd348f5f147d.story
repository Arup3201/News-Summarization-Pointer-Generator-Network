The latest craze to sweep Seattle isn’t a new brand of coffee, or even some underground indie band – it’s a conservative evangelical church.

But rather than hymns and hallelujahs, the Mars Hill Church in Seattle caters to a niche audience of contemporary young adults, and no subject is off limits.

Those in the congregation regularly discuss traditionally taboo topics of sex and drinking, but in stark contrast, they hold many traditional biblical views and think homosexuality is a sin.

Seattle's best: Mars Hill Church's services are held in a converted warehouse and feature rock 'n roll music

Enter Mark Driscoll, who founded the church in the late 1990s. He has become something of a symbol of the religious organization, often wearing signature rolled jeans and a blazer.

He said that he was motivated to start a new kind of church after he realized most of the members of local churches were female, and the men, too, were effeminate. 

He said in a 2006 interview: ‘If you want to win a war, you have to get the men.’ Thus began his tough-love approach to Christianity. 

Driscoll holds services in a massive warehouse in Seattle, though Mars Hill now has several auxiliary campuses all over Washington state, with another in Los Angeles, and one in Albuquerque.

The services often feature rock and roll music with guitars, bass, and drums, as opposed to traditional hymns, perhaps played on piano or organ. The website states the atmosphere is ‘casual, reflective, and open to all.’

The church’s Facebook page shows a long line of events, where LED lights are given to children at a party for Old Testament heroine Ester, and a wing cook-off, complete with artisan sauces.

Likewise, many members sport tattoos, and enjoy indie rock - not things typically associated with a conservative Christian movement.

And Driscoll himself doesn’t shy away from topics, talking to millennial and Gen Y-ers about seemingly out-of-bounds topics like oral sex, as Alternet first reported. 

He also teaches that women should submit to their husbands as the church submits to Christ. 

As Alternet points out, Driscoll’s teachings are very in-line with hot-topic secular views of the decline of young men and the rising of young women. But, as the publication notes, Driscoll believes that women’s strength is caused by men’s weakness.

The church offers counselling in gender roles. There are many stories of couples who were unhappy in their marriages, often times because Mars Hill said they weren’t submitting to their God-given roles of wife as nurturer and husband as bread-winner.

Those who have chosen to leave the church have met a fair amount of controversy.

A blog called Mars Hill Refugee chronicles the stories of those who left, giving reasons of why they felt it right to go and how they thought the church wronged them.

One former member, Andrew, said that he was punished after it was revealed he was ‘sexually involved’ with another church member.

In the Mars Hill Church Discipline Contract issued, it was alleged: ‘The repercussions of Andrew’s sin have been widespread…as a result, he is under church discipline with the hope and goal of full restoration upon walking in a repentant  lifestyle.’

He had to sign a contract over his ‘plan of discipline’ that involved writing out the chronology of his so-called illicit relationship and share it with a pastor. He was also to write a list of people he sinned against.

A feature in The Stranger last January questioned if Mars Hill was in fact a church, or just a cult, churning out the types of men and women who would be beneficial to it, citing several cases where members balked at one part or another of the church and were punished for not adhering to the church’s authority.

The article notes that Driscoll believes in his 'womb to tomb' philosophy - of creating and cultivating believers in Christ - but 'only if (members) don't ask too many questions.'
