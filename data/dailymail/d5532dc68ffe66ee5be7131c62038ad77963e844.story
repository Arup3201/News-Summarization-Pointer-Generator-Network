Beggars, down and outs and vagrants have been used for generations by painters and sculptors to represent the virtue of charitable giving in their artworks.

And as these stunning pictures show, beggars became a hugely popular theme for postcards in the early part of the last century.

Renowned British art dealer John Kasmin was so fascinated by the unflinchingly stark images of the characters who made their living on streets all over the world that he collected hundreds and they have now been published in a new book.

'Beggars made good subjects for cards. Exaggerated characters or heart string pullers' Mr Kasmin explained. 'They knew how to pose, how to present the face, the posture of neediness, dereliction, despair - it was their livelihood, their ability.'

The postcard on the left was sent by a German soldier in the First World War, who took a picture of this beggar in Romania. 'Edel' means 'noble' in German, and 'Panje' is the same world translated into a Slavic language. The soldier gave him some tobacco for posing. The picture on the right, which was processed in the UK, is of a beggar in Shanghai. He was begging for food - his rice bowl and chopsticks can be seen in the background. The date of the photograph is uncertain.

This mother and boy seem happy to pose in the postcard on the left, which was taken in India. Mr Kasmin suggests that the woman's clothes may have been very precisely arranged by the photographer. The woman on the right, pictured in the Béarn region of southern France, is better dressed than most. Two lines of poetry in a French dialect have been printed on the bottom of the card

This pair of Chinese beggars - pictured in a French postcard which mentions a Jesuit mission in the area - are grandfather and grandson

There may, however, be a more unpleasant reason behind the boom in postcards of the needy - the gratification of seeing others worse off.

'(The postcards) might 
signify only delight in human variety, but might also imply 
schadenfreude - there but for the grace of God go we.' he said.

'We (sender and receiver) celebrate our superiority, poor though we may be.'

In 'Want: Kasmin's Postcards', Mr Kasmin points to another more practical reason why the beggars would have been the perfect subject for photographers of the time: their lifestyles. 'They were used to holding still, thus aiding photographers who were obliged, in those days, to make long exposures with plate cameras'.

Mr Kasmin is credited with discovering David 
Hockney, and was one of the first art dealers to open a vast modern 
gallery space in London; but his latest project is a fascinating study of the psychology of the down and outs and why people wanted images of them.

The collection has photographs from all over Europe, as well as China and India. There is even a representation from Bradford, England.

The beggar in the left-hand postcard, who has only one coin in his hat, had his picture taken in Bolivia by a representative of a mining company. The children on the left were photographed in Quimper, Brittany in France.

On the reverse of the right-hand postcard above, a boy has written a message home to his mother from school. It is signed with 'a thousand big kisses from your little Alphonse who loves you, and kisses to little Marcel'.

The largest part of the collection, however, comes from France, which in 1905 had a staggering one per cent of the population begging for alms.

But despite their varied origins - the photographs give an unapologetic insight into the lives of the destitute.

Some characters remain cheerful, looking carefree as they beam for the camera - despite lacking basic comforts such as shoes, food and of course money.

Others look worn and exhausted as they hold out their hands for a coin or two - but in spite of their poverty their gaze remains proud and dignified.

In some pictures, generations of begging families pose together, showing how once born into poverty it was difficult to escape to a better life.

'Salt Jim', left, begged in Bradford, Yorkshire, and would traditionally ask for a half-penny. The man on the right, photographed in Tours, France, in 1910 is wearing a traditional shepherd's outfit as he begs

Two local characters from France are show here. On the left a beggar known as 'Chicot' waits for the residents of Chartres, France - mischievously described on the card as 'clients' - to give him money. The card on the right, showing 'the famous Gogo' was sent as a love note in 1905, from an anonymous gentlemen telling the object of his affections that he 'thinks only of her'.

Postcards were an extremely popular way of staying in touch with others during the early 20th century.

Before the widespread use of the telephone, and before the invention of the internet, they were an affordable way of communicating with loved ones - and even for courting potential suitors.

Collecting them developed into a huge craze, particularly between 1907 and 1913.

The first postcard appeared in Austria in 1869, before arriving in Britain a year later.

During World War I, they became a vital link between people, as just about everybody would use the cheap cards to stay in touch with one another.

Compelling images, from as far away as China and India, were once a hugely popular subject for postcards

Mr Kasmin says images may have been popular because they reassured people the someone was worse of than them

Or perhaps it was simply because the beggars knew how to pose for early, clunky cameras
