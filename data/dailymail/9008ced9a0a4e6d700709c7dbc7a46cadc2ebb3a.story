A 130-year-old homestead has been destroyed by a blaze, just two days before its new buyers were to settle their $4.5 million sale.

The 1,336ha historic home named Glen Alpine in Werris Creek, near Tamworth which is northwest of NSW, has been burnt to the ground with nothing left but its five chimney stacks and an underground cellar.

It's a devastating loss for the new buyers who had plans make the big move from the city to enjoy a country lifestyle as part of their retirement.

The mansion named Glen Alpine, in Werris Creek near Tamworth which is northwest of NSW, was burnt down on October 8

The 130-year-old homestead was built in 1886 and designed by famous architect John Horbury Hunt

 All that's left of the residence is its five chimney pots and an underground cellar

Fire crews were called out the home at 12.45am on October 8 but said it was 'pretty well gone' by the time they arrived

Peter Davis, captain of Fire and Rescue NSW's Werris Creek unit, says the home was 'pretty well gone' by the time emergency crew attended the scene at about 12.45am on October 8.

'There was nothing to save by the time we got there so we tried to stop the fire getting to surrounding bushland,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Buyers Antony Tisch and wife Wendy were devastated when they heard the news.

'We've been trying to buy the property for eight years,' Mr Tisch told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was such a magnificently beautiful home with a grand old staircase, ballroom and so much character.

'Not only is it sad for us but it's also sad for Australia.' 

The mansion, built in 1886, was designed by famous architect John Horbury Hunt.

Mr Tisch, a Sydney landscaper and builder, says the property would be irreplaceable.

'The property survived 130 years of drought and fires but now it's just gone for nothing,' he said.

'To rebuild that signature house it'll probably cost $10 million and it'll be so hard to replace some of it.'

The new buyers were excited to move into this home with a 'grand old staircase'

Mr Tisch was hoping to settle into his new home last weekend and was planning to live there for three weeks a month and a week in Sydney

While the residence had undergone extensive renovations, it also featured fenced paddocks with capacity to stock up to 400 cows and 200 steers.

The couple had already bought the champagne and even some ducks to keep on their homestead - ready for their move to the farm last weekend.

'Wendy and I are in our early 50s now so we wanted to settle there and have a change of lifestyle,' Mr Tisch said.

'We were going to spend three weeks there and a week in Sydney.'

Since the house burnt down, Mr Tisch couldn't bare to return back to what used to be his dream home. 

'I just couldn't go up to see it yet. It was supposed to be the happiest day for us and now it's turned into the saddest.'

Mr Tisch plans on continuing the settlement for Glen Alpine - which was originally listed for $4.95 million - as he has already bought neighbouring properties.

However he is due to undergo court proceedings about the insurance of the property with current owner Jeffrey Hawkins. 

The fire which burnt the property to the ground is currently under investigation by police.
