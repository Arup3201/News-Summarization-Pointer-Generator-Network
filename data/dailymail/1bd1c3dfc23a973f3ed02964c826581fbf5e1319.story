A suspected Islamic State militant taken prisoner in Iraq has protested his innocence despite video showing him at an ISIS rally after the capture of a major city.

Alozat Abbas is one of three alleged jihadist fighters captured by Kurdish peshmerga forces who have clawed by territory with the help of U.S. air strikes.

The 22-year-old insists his arrest was a mistake, saying he never supported ISIS and was tortured into confessing, according to Sky News which gained access to the prisoners at a secret location.

But he doesn't deny taking part in an ISIS gathering after the capture of Mosul in June, where he is seen holding an AK-47 aloft with an ammunition belt wrapped around his Barcelona football shirt.

He is the only one of dozens of armed fighters who have not covered their face and he shows no sign of being coerced.

Abbas said he realised his mistake in revealing his identity, but claims he couldn't run because the extremist group threatened to kill him.

He told Sky News: 'It's one way - if you go you can't come back again.

'They were threatening us - we were afraid'.

He was identified from the video by Kurdish forces and later arrested, still in his Barcelona shirt, which had the name of striker Neymar on the back.

Another of the prisoners, Omer Hassan, 19, claims he was also tortured.

'They tied my hands for seven days behind my back and beat me and kicked me,' he added.

All three claim they have never shot anyone and were simply rebelling against former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki.

It came as the Islamic State issued a chilling threat online that it would attack U.S. targets 'in any place' in revenge for American
 air strikes against them in Iraq.    

Macabre message: Islamic State militants posted a chilling video online showing a blood-spattered Star and Stripes next to the jihadist flag with the threat 'we will drown all of you in blood' in revenge for U.S. air strikes

The
 extremist group posted a chilling video showing a blood-spattered Star 
and Stripes next to the jihadist flag with the message in English: 'We 
will drown all of you in blood'.

The
 message was accompanied by photographs of an American who was beheaded 
during the U.S. occupation of Iraq and victims of sniper shootings.

Unlike
 Al Qaeda, the Islamic State has so far focused on seizing land in Iraq 
and Syria for its self-proclaimed caliphate, not spectacular attacks on 
Western targets.

Earlier, President Barack Obama announced that Kurdish peshmerga troops, 
supported by U.S. jets, had recaptured the strategically important Mosul
 Dam, hailing the offensive as a 'major step forward'.
