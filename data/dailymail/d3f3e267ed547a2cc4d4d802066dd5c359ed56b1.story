Little Eddie Sharp was given just 18 months to live when he was born with a rare and deadly metabolic disease known as 'childhood Alzheimer's'.

The now four-year-old, who lives in Manly Vale in Sydney's north, was diagnosed at birth with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C - a genetically inherited disease that can cause irreversible brain damage.

For now, Eddie's brain is slowly still developing but the deadly disease, which doctors say is similar to Alzheimer's, has already robbed him of his physical strength.

Four-year-old Eddie Sharp was born with Niemann-Pick Disease Type C -  a genetically inherited disease that can cause irreversible brain damage

'He was pretty good for the first 18 months. He had low muscle tone so he had difficulty walking, he had a small appetite and he didn't have a lot of language... he was delayed,' his mother, Ali Malone, told Daily Mail Australia.

'Now, physically he can't even sit up. He's in a wheelchair and we're really starting to notice the physical stuff more at the moment.

'His biggest challenges are not walking and a build up of fluid in his lungs.' 

This disease, often known as 'childhood Alzheimer's', has already robbed Eddie of his physical strength but his mother Ali Malone says his brain is still developing for now

Two years ago, little Eddie was dealt another blow. He was diagnosed with Leukaemia - a totally unrelated illness to Niemann-Pick Disease Type C  

Physically, Eddie is unable to sit up on his own now with the disease robbing him of his gross motor skills

Ms Malone said while Eddie wasn't facing any mental challenges just yet, he could have similar problems to older people with Alzheimer's in the near future. 

But  there's actually no way of knowing what's in store for Eddie.

Niemann-Pick Disease Type C is so rare there's only about 15 recorded cases in Australia.

There is currently no cure and the disease is always fatal.

'They think it works in a similar way to Alzheimer's. It moves through the body and attacks different organs at different times,' Ms Malone said. 

'There are roughly only five or six living cases in Australia, the others have already passed.

'We almost lost Eddie in April... the average lifespan is about seven years.'

But two years ago, Eddie was dealt another blow. 

He was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - a totally unrelated illness.

'He spent basically all of last year in hospital doing chemotherapy. It was horrendous, it wasn't great,' Ms Malone said. 

'He knows he's sick but he doesn't understand, we don't even understand. 

'Before he was diagnosed with leukaemia, he was pretty good but not perfect. He was younger so the gap wasn't as wide as it is now in terms of development.

'In those 12 months he was in hospital getting chemotherapy, we took our eyes off the physical deterioration (due to his other illness), so it's difficult to see how he's changed.'

His parents Ali and Peter Sharp remain positive despite the difficult times they've faced. 

'We've got two other children so we have to get on with it,' Ms Malone said. 

'Eddie has been sick his entire life. Even before his leukaemia he was a born patient. He actually loves the hospital, he thinks it's great fun.

'When he does go there's always someone from the family there with him and he loves the attention. 

'He’s quite cheeky, he is very social and he loves big groups.'

Eddie's mother says even before he was diagnosed with leukaemia, he was a 'born patient'

Having spent most of his life in and out of hospitals, Eddie has grown to love it and the attention he gets

Between hospital appointments and raising their family, Eddie's parents spend time fundraising and raising awareness about Niemann-Pick research projects

The Sharp family are hosting the Cure4Ed Family Fun Day on Sunday, October 26 at Balgowlah Bowling Club 

Between hospital appointments and raising their family, Eddie's parents spend time fundraising and raising awareness about Niemann-Pick research projects. 

The research could also lead to a breakthrough for Alzheimer’s patients with doctors saying the diseases are closely linked. 

The NPC Foundation, which is supporting the research, needs to raise $120,000 by the end of the year.

Ms Malone is also working to obtain funding for music therapy programs for children diagnosed with Niemann-Pick.

Eddie's family will host the Cure4Ed Family Fun Day on Sunday, October 26 at Balgowlah Bowling Club.

What is it?  

A person with Niemann Pick Disease Type C is unable to process cholesterol properly. Excessive amounts of cholesterol accumulate in their liver and spleen and eventually their brain, doing irreversible damage.

Symptoms

Enlarged spleen and liver, prolonged jaundice, progressive loss of motor skills, difficultly walking, slurred speech, swallowing problems, seizures and dementia.

How is it inherited? 

A child with Niemann-Pick disease would have inherited one abnormal genes from each of their parents. These genes are recessive, which means the parents may not have any clinical signs. There is a 25 percent the child will inherit the disease.
