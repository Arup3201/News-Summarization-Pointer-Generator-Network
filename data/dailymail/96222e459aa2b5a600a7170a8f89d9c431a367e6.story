A new app is set to begin renting out New York rooms by the hour.

Breather claims to offer its users a 'private, quiet space'.

It says the $25 per hour rooms can be used 'to make a phone call, have a meeting or catch up on some zâ€™s.'

The app lets users choose rooms across New York - and even comes with a handy timer to let you know just how much time you have left

Each room is fitted with a special smart lock.

When users make a booking, they are sent a code to open the door - but only while their booking is life.

Once they are inside, the app shows a countdown clock showing how long they have left.

Rooms have desks, couches, chairs, fast Wi-Fi and even coffee machines.

The app, which recently raised $1.5m in funding, was invented by Canadian Julien Smith, and is already live in New York and Montreal, with plans to open in San Francisco within weeks.

He said the service was already popular with freelancers needing an office for a meeting, for job interviews or even by doctors needed to see patients in a private location.

'People use it for phone calls, we have people who use a room for an hour a day, and use it as their office,' he told MailOnline.

'All of our locations are inside commercial buildings - they are not apartments.'

He admitted the biggest challenge facing the firm was persuading people it was not being used by couples or for more nefarious uses.

'The real reason people freak out is because we charge by the hour.

'When something is new, people jump to conclusions, for example, Snapchat being used just for sending naked pictures,'

'We are supremely conscious that the nature of our service makes people think it can work it a nefarious way.

The app also allows you to invite friends to your room - with facilities such as couches and even yoga mats on offer in some locations.

'However, we are not concerned about the issue - we acknowledge its the first thing pople think of, but its not what happens.

'You don't not invent the subway because people can jump in front of it.'

Rooms are kitted out with desks, couches, chairs, fast Wi-Fi and many plugs - but not beds.

'The room is stocked with everything you need - and nothing that you donâ€™t,' the firm said.

It also said rooms were cleaned after each visit.
