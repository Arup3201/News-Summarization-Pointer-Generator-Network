Two men who were flying over the Sydney to Hobart yacht race when their light plane plunged 'nose first' into deep sea near the finish line have been found dead in the cockpit of the plane wreck.

Pilot Sam Langford, 29, and photographer Tim Jones, 61, were taking photos of boats competing in the race when on Monday afternoon their single-engine Cessna crashed and disappeared in waters near the Tasman Peninsula, in southeast Tasmania. 

Police confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that the plane has been found at the bottom of the sea. 

Tasmania Police Inspector Lee Renshaw said an operation to recover the wreck and two bodies is under way.

'Weather conditions, while sloppy, are not windy and that is good for recovery. As long as the weather stays favourable, we hope to make good progress,' he said.

Two tourists who were watching the boat race from a cliff top told the ABC they saw a plane flying 'too low' off Cape Raoul.

Nona Radonja said: 'It was flying really, really low so I thought that was strange.'

And Chris James added: 'It did look out of place ... too low for a plane, I think.' 

An air, land and sea search was in its third day when the bodies were found in the area where oil has been seen on the water surface, and where a set of aviation headphones were found.

Seven boats competing in the yacht race, some of whom witnessed the crash, have been praised for going to the aid of the stricken aircraft.

Mr Langford, from Mount Nelson, and Mr Jones, from Hobart, are thought to have plunged into waters off the Tasman peninsula in their plane at about 6.20pm on Monday. 

Police commander Tony Cerritelli said the plane was flying in less than ideal weather conditions and was just 300 metres from a race competitor when it went down.

'It was flying at around mast level and plunged nose-first into the water,' he said on Tuesday. 

Race competitor Mistraal radioed for help as it rushed to where crew members saw the plane's tail disappear beneath the waves.

The Mistraal team sent a mayday call, which has appeared on social media. 

'Mayday, mayday, mayday. We have a plane in the water. Plane in the water at 43 14 147 50. This is Mistraal. Mistraal,' it said.

The crew then radioed to say they were at the crash site.  

Owner and skipper Simon Kurts and his Sydney to Hobart yacht Love and War is reportedly helping to search for the plane

A few unique items were received on Tuesday. 

'It's a headrest, a set of headphones and a cover off one of the earpieces on aviation headphones with a boom microphone,' Insp Renshaw said. 

Waters in the area are up to 90 metres and too deep for divers. 

Three-time winner Love & War joined in the initial search, along with Mistral, Enchantress, Inner Circle, Helsal III and Wax Lyrical. 

The crash is thought to have happened around 30nm from the race finish in the Derwent River in Hobart

A statement from race organiser, Cruising Yacht Club Of Australia commodore John Cameron, said: 'We know of several yachts that were in the vicinity that may have diverted to render assistance.'

The Cessna 172 is owned by Airlines of Tasmania, the ABC reports.

The managing director of Airlines of Tasmania, Shannon Wells, said there were two people on board the plane 'which was conducting aerial photography of the Sydney to Hobart yacht race'.

'At this time our thoughts are with the families of the persons on board,' he told the ABC.
