After a particularly tough year last year, Courtenay Henricks enjoyed a perfect Christmas.

She had just had a party to celebrate her 30th birthday and the fact that she beat the aggressive breast cancer she was diagnosed with in March.

Ms Henricks, her husband and two children had gone back to Tasmania from their new home in Kingsgrove, south Sydney, to spend Christmas with family.

Now the mother-of-two, who was again diagnosed with cancer, is trying to raise $20,000 for her bucket list

Then on Boxing Day her husband Troy Henricks re-proposed to her and gave her the engagement ring they never got around to buying when they eloped six years earlier.

But she had also been suffering chest pains and just two weeks ago she decided to go to hospital to make sure it was nothing more serious than fluid on her lungs.

A CT scan was done to check for lung clots but when oncologists started coming into the hospital room to check the results Ms Henricks knew something was wrong.

The scans revealed that the breast cancer she had been cleared of in August had in fact spread to her lungs and chest, with three masses on her left lung and an 8-9cm node in the middle of her chest.

Her doctor didn't want to give her an exact prognosis, but said the best case scenario for Ms Henricks' type of cancer was a 22 per cent chance of making it to five years. And she was not among the best cases.

'I probably don't have a great chance of seeing my littlest into kindy,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'At best guess I think I've got three years.'

Now Ms Henricks is trying to raise enough money so she can tick off all the things on her bucket list with her husband, their five-year-old daughter Aili and 15-month-old son Caelan.

Ms Henrick's was told earlier this month that she has at best three years left to live

On Boxing Day last year, her husband re-proposed to her at the spot where they got married six years ago

'I want to do a lot of little things like go Luna Park with the kids and spend every weekend doing fun activities,' she said.

'I know it sounds really selfish but I want to make sure my littlest remembers me.

'I know my eldest will, but with those memories you don't want to have the older kid and the dad reminding the youngest what happened.'

Also on her list is to go on a big overseas holiday.

'I've always wanted to travel with my husband,' Ms Henricks said.

'We've been married six years now, and the honeymoon was a one night camping trip.

'I want to do the touristy things everyone can say they have done, and I don't have a great deal of time to do that.' 

'I know it sounds really selfish but I want to make sure my littlest remembers me,' she said

Ms Henricks would also love to go on a cruise around New Caledonia with her husband and children, go on a hot air balloon ride at sunrise and go skydiving

Ms Henricks wants to raise $20,000 so she can afford to fly business class because her lung problems mean she needs to be able to lie down on long-haul flights.

Among her top destinations to travel to are London, Paris, Greece and Turkey.

Ms Henricks also wants to visit the U.S. to spend Thanksgiving with her father and his wife.

And she wants to visit Ireland in memory of her mother. 

'My mum died when I was 17, of breast cancer, and she always wanted to visit Ireland with me but in the end she was too sick,' Ms Henricks said.

For the next few months she will be undergoing chemotherapy, which has a 50 per cent chance of reducing the severity of her cancer.

'With the aggression of mine we're aiming for stabilisation and if we can shrink it at all,' she said.

'At this rate we're just trying to hold it off as long as possible, and get a bit more quality and quantity out of life.'

Ms Henricks says she knows it's going to be a 'really rocky journey', especially as she works out how to explain the situation to her children.

'But we can treat it like a hijacked car ride, or like some bumper cars at the Show,' she said,

'And I think I'd like to take the second option.'
