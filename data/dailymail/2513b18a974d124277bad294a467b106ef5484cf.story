The Ferguson police officer who was shot in the arm was released from the hospital as the search for the shooter continues, police say.

The officer was shot during a routine patrol near the new Ferguson Community Center and away from the protests related to the death of Michael Brown.

The body camera worn by the officer was off at the time, though officials do not know why. 

Officials say that the officer saw the suspect standing behind the community center and gave chase after he fled. The suspect turned and fired at the officer, striking him in the left arm.

The New York Times reported that the suspect fled into the woods, but that an hour and a half search by Ferguson and other departments turned up empty. 

The reports revised earlier statements that there were two shooters and that the officer was responding to a burglary. 

St Louis County Police spokesperson Sgt Brian Schellman said that the officer was wearing a body camera that was turned off for an unknown reason at the time of the shooting.

Ferguson police began wearing body cameras in August that had been donated by two security companies. 

The officer was treated for non-life threatening injuries and officials believe he will live after being released from the hospital.

Another shooting, this of an off-duty St Louis Metropolitan Police officer, happened hours later, though there are no indications it is related to events in Ferguson.

An earlier press conference by St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said police are hunting for the suspect and he did not think the shooting was related to protests over Michael Brown’s death at the hands of white police officer Darren Brown.

The center is located  away from where the protesters had gathered and Belmar said he did not think the shooting was related to protests over Brown’s death.

'I don’t think it is,' he said. 'It didn’t happen within the proximity of the protest area. This is a fairly secluded area. I wouldn’t have any reason to think that it was linked in any way, shape or form.  

At the original press conference, Belmar said officers chased two suspects, and as he closed in on one of them, the second suspect pulled out a gun and fired at the officer, who was shot in one arm before returning fire. 

Officials have not released the officer’s name or said how long he had been on the police force.

Mike O'Connell, communications director for the State Emergency Management Agency, said authorities were looking for the suspect.

He said: 'A search is underway for the suspect in the shooting of the officer.' 

Search: Police officers from various forces have gathered in the area to deal with the aftermath of the shooting

Police from various different forces  responded to the scene  and set up a staging area on West Florissant Road, KMOV reported. 

Reports indicate that the suspect fled on foot into a neighborhood near West Florissant Avenue and Stein Street.

Officers and police helicopters canvassed the area in an attempt to find the shooter.

There were conflicting reports over the reason for the shooting which appears not to be linked to protests over the death of Michael Brown by a white police officer.

NBC News reported an officer interrupted a burglary at a business on Saturday night and was shot in the arm once before the suspect ran off.

Earlier on Saturday, an eyewitness told NBC News: 'Everybody was fine, they said, police stay back and then all of a sudden a black guy came pushing everybody, when I was right behind the chief.'

Antonio French, an Alderman of the 21st ward in St. Louis tweeted: 'Police are being instructed to get in riot gear.' 

According to several eyewitness accounts on Twitter, Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol told protestors: 'I'm going to ask you to leave and I'm only asking you one time.'

In a video posted on social media Johnson then told protesters that the officer was the only person who was shot.

Meanwhile, a small, peaceful crowd of local residents gathered near the police staging area on West Florissant Road.

Suspect: Chief Jackson said police are hunting for the suspect and he did not think the shooting was related to protests over Michael Brown’s death at the hands of white police officer Darren Brown

Vice News reports that a St Louis Metropolitan Police officer was injured when a black sedan crossed two lanes of traffic and fired into his personal vehicle on Interstate 70.

An unknown number of shooters produced handguns and fired at the vehicle. The driver of the vehicle was injured by the shattered window.

Officials say the officer was wearing the pants of his St Louis Metropolitan Police uniform, but not the shirt or jacket. The incident is being investigated and it is unclear whether it was a targeted attempt on the officer's life.

The shootings came just days after Ferguson police chief Tom Jackson issued a video apology to Brown's parents following weeks of heavy criticism and calls for him to resign.

In the video released on Thursday Jackson apologized to the parents for taking so long to remove the body of their son from the street.

Sorry: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released this video apology on Thursday to the family of  Michael Brown and apologized for leaving the teenager's body in the street for so long

Dead: Police took more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street where he was shot August 9

'I want to say this to the Brown family: No one who has not experienced the loss of a child can understand what you're feeling. I am truly sorry for the loss of your son,' Jackson said. 

But his apology was not well-received among some and led to reported protests hours after it was issued.  

The grieving parents of Michael Brown said they were unmoved by the apology made by the Ferguson police chief - over a month after their unarmed teenage son was shot dead by an officer.

Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, called for Chief Jackson to be fired and his father, Michael Brown Sr., said rather than an apology, he would like to see Officer Darren Wilson arrested.

Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager was fatally shot by Officer Darren Wilson on August 9, despite several eyewitness accounts which suggested he had his hands up in a 'don't shoot' position. 

His death sparked days of protests, some violent and many peaceful, in the predominately black neighborhood of Ferguson Missouri where racial tensions reached boiling point.

Protesters: Residents said officers were excessively aggressive towards them and unleashed the national guard, tear gas and military equipment during the unrest

Support: The U.S. Justice Department has asked the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department to order its officers not to wear bracelets in support of the white policeman who shot to death an unarmed black teenager

During the protests, residents said officers were excessively aggressive towards them and unleashed National Guard troops, tear gas and military equipment.

In the video apology, Jackson apologized for the heavy handed response from his officers towards the peaceful protesters.

But earlier this week, police officers from the St. Louis County Department were spotted wearing ‘I am Darren Wilson’ bracelets whilst on duty. 

Residents from Ferguson complained about the black bracelets - which had stark white lettering on them with the words 'I am Darren Wilson' emblazoned across them - during a meeting with federal officials.
