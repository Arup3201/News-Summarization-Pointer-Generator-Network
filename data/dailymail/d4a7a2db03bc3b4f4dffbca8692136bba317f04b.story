The discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath Mexico City has offered gruesome evidence of the brutal rituals of the Aztecs.

Archaeologists excavating the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, on the site of the modern-day Mexican capital, found the 500-year-old remains around a sacrificial stone in the city's Sacred Precinct.

On such stones victims were offered up for ritual sacrifice by priests who split open their abdomen from belly to throat and then pulled out their still-beating hearts.

Gruesome: The five skulls discovered by archaeologists beneath a sacrificial stone which have been pierced on the sides to be hung on a rack known as a tzompantli and displayed outside a temple

The find the largest cache of skulls yet discovered at the site and archaeologists say they were likely used in rituals associated with Mictlantecuhtli, the Aztec god of death.

Forty-five of the skulls were discovered above the stone, and a further five, more-fragmented specimens were found below which had holes in both sides, suggesting they were once hung on a skull rack.

Such racks, known as tzompantlis, were used to display the crania of sacrificed people near temples and other important locations.

Other skulls had been modified in a way that suggested they were to be made into masks, but never completed.

Offering: Archaeologists say the skulls were probably buried there during a period of building and renovation as a tribute to Mictlantecuhtli, the Aztec god of death

Rituals: Some of the skulls had been modified in a way that suggested they were to be made into masks, but never completed

Archaeologist Raul Barrera Rodriguez, head of the Urban Archaeology Programme of Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), suggested the skulls were deposited in various offerings.

'The skulls were used by the ancient Aztecs as elements of consecration or closing of architectural spaces and rituals associated with the worship of Mictlantecuhtli, god of death, so perhaps it is a gift that served to close any prehispanic building,' he said.

'Some of the 45 skulls that were above the sacrificial stone, have been manipulated with the intention to prepare "skull-masks" that were never finished,' he added.

These kinds of masks, common among the Aztecs, were representations of death god Mictlantecuhtli, archaeologist Ximena Chavez said.

Finished versions would be adorned with green stone to simulate the eyes and accompanied with spiral necklaces, rattles and obsidian knives.

The five skulls with holes are believed to have been buried between 1375 and 1427 and archaeologists consider them an offering of consecration to sacrificial stone they lay beneath

Some 250 jaw bones were also found

In the usual procedure of the ritual, sacrificial victims would be taken to the top of the temple where four priests would lay them down on a stone slab.

The victim's abdomen would be sliced open by a fifth priest using a ceremonial flint knife to cut right through the diaphragm and split open the chest.

The priest would grab the heart and tear it out, still beating.

It would then be placed in a bowl held by a statue of the honoured god, and the body thrown down the temple's stairs landing at a terrace at the base of the pyramid.

For the re-consecration of Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan in 1487, the Aztecs reported that they sacrificed about 80,400 prisoners over the course of four days.

Historians believe that figure may be an exaggeration.

The 45 skulls above the sacrificial 
stone were discovered in mid-August as workers carried out 
infrastructure work to create a lobby for the Archaeological Zone and 
Templo Mayor Museum.

Mexico City was once the site of Tenochtitland, the capital of the Aztec civilisation which dominated much of Mesoamerica from the 14th to 16th Centuries.

The Aztecs were finally vanquished in 1521 by Spanish conquistadores led by Hernan Cortes, who were helped by a number of indigenous allies, perhaps uncomfortable with the constant human sacrifices, to overrun Tenochtitlan.

Aztec culture is these days primarily known through archaeological evidence found in excavations such as Templo Mayor in Mexico City; indigenous bark paper codices; and eyewitness accounts of Spanish invaders.

According to Mr Barrera Rodriguez, most of the skulls are from women and men who were between 20 and 35 years old when they died.

They may have been dug up from other burial sites and reburied there, he added.

He believes they were buried sometime between 1440 and 1469 as work was going on to build a new temple at the site.

'The skulls were found in good condition, as moisture conditions facilitated their preservation, but were fragmented by the weight of the floors and filled with earth above them, a good portion of them are complete,' said archaeologist Est√≠baliz Aguayo, who added that there may be attempts to restore them.

The five skulls with holes are believed to have been buried earlier - between 1375 and 1427 - and archaeologists consider them an offering of consecration to sacrificial stone they lay beneath.
