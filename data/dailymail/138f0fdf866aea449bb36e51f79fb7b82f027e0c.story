Pet owners wanting to take their animals abroad will have to complete reams of extra paperwork due to tough new measures to prevent smugglers from Eastern Europe bringing in illegal puppies which may have rabies.

Vets around the country have reported dogs coming in to Britain from countries such as Lithuania, Hungary and Slovakia with fake papers and without being vaccinated against the virulent disease.

UK port controls identified 376 dogs arriving with faulty paperwork last year, up from 89 in 2010. The increased trade has been fuelled by demand for cheap pedigree puppies sold for up to £300 on the internet instead of the £500 to £1,200 asked by some breeders in Britain.

Now Ministers have approved a secure new  pet passport to prevent criminals falsifying information. It follows alarm last October when two puppies contracted rabies in Holland within a week of being imported from Bulgaria.

From December, new pet passports will have a unique number printed on every page and the  section recording the pet’s microchip number and the date of the rabies vaccine will be laminated to help prevent fraud. The name, address and contact details of the vet will also be included.

Puppies travelling into Britain and the rest of the EU will have to be at least 15 weeks old. A 12-week minimum age for puppies to be vaccinated against rabies is being introduced and pets must wait three weeks before travelling.

For the first time, pets will also have to be checked as they cross borders on their way to the UK.The new royal blue passports will include the date the pet was vaccinated against rabies, the date valid for travel and the vaccine expiry date. Pets must be revaccinated every five years to qualify for a passport.

Owners who already have valid pet passports are not required to buy a new one.

Valerie John, from West Drayton, West London, last month paid £700 for her pug Tallulah from what she thought was an established breeder in Hertfordshire, only to discover the dog was from Lithuania.

She said: ‘The vet spotted straight away the papers were fake. Tallulah was only seven or eight weeks old and too young to have a rabies vaccination so had to go into quarantine, which is going to cost £1,100.’
