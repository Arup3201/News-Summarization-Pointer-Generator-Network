New research reveals 85 per cent of Brits would like to explore the UK more - if fuel wasn't quite so expensive

Among the top places to visit, survey respondents chose Edinburgh Castle and Stonehenge

However, 85 per cent of those surveyed admit that they would like to explore more of the UK if petrol was cheaper.

Over a third of respondents also revealed that, although they have had to cut down on family day trips, Stonehenge tops the list of UK attractions that families would most like to visit.

Other top sights include The Eden Project in Cornwall and Edinburgh Castle. 

The survey also revealed that one quarter of British families would choose the seaside as their dream day out, particularly if their petrol was provided. 

To help Britons reach their holiday hotposts, Tesco and RAC have teamed up to offer tips on how to drive more efficiently.

Among their recommendations, keeping your tyres inflated and accelerating and decelerating gently are two of their top quick fixes to help make the most of your Bank Holiday car trips.

1. Stonehenge

2. The Eden Project (tied with Edinburgh Castle)

3. Cadbury World

4. Windsor Castle

5. Kew Gardens (tied with the London Eye)

1. Keep tyres inflated

2. Accelerate and decelerate gently

3. Remove your roof rack 

3. De-clutter to lighten car (it will then require less effort to accelerate)

4. Turn off your engine whenever possible
