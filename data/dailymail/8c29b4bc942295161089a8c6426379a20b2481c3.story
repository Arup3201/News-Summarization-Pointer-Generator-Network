An Argentinian painter is making a splash in the world of art by colouring with his eyes. 

Leandro Granato, 27, snorts up to a pint-and-a-half of watercolour and thanks to an unusual connection between his nose and eyes he is able to squirt the paint onto a canvas.

The Argentinian artist's works take from 10 minutes to months to create, and sell for up to £1,500.

Hitting the target: Argentinian artist Leandro Granato, 27, makes his living squirting paint from his eyes

Mr Granato began pushing liquid from his nose through his eye at a young age.

He now uses it to create unique works of art.

'Ever since I was a kid I knew I had a special connection between my eye and my nose,’ he said.

‘As I grew up I started realising air and liquids could go out of my eye if I put them through my nose.

‘Now I am the inventor of a new painting style in the art world.

‘When I decided I would do this for a living my whole family thought I was going crazy - as well as many other people.

‘But as time went by they began to understand the art I call eye-painting.’

Mr Granato spent two years training and developing a special formula of paint that does not damage his eyes.

Leandro believes he is the only person in the world to paint this way.

‘My motivation to become an artist first came when my grandfather died because of cancer,’ said Mr Granato.

‘After this loss, I started painting to overcome this pain.'

Mr Granato cites American artist 
Jackson Pollock as one of his inspirations. The 20th century painter 
made his name by using unusual painting techniques, developing his own unique style of drip painting.

He said: ‘Jackson Pollock is one of my inspirations mainly because at first nobody understood him, and he was pointed out to be crazy.’

Leandro is planning a charity event to help a children's cancer hospital in Argentina.

He is also searching for more galleries and art dealers to help him spread the word about his art in Europe.

‘Some people like my abilities, some don't,’ said Leandro.

‘Some say I'm crazy, but my technique doesn't hurt my body.

‘I believe crazy people are often the ones that build the roads that the wise ones will then travel across.

‘I'm constantly being examined by expert doctors, and the formula I came up with is harmless.

‘It will not cause me any health problems in the future.’
