Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly will reportedly start chemotherapy and radiation next week.

The
 treatment plan was outlined Tuesday by Dr. Peter Costantino of Lenox 
Hill Hospital in New York City, where the longtime Buffalo Bills star is
 being treated for a sinus cancer.

Costantino
 says he's confident the regimen has a good chance of success. If not, 
he says Kelly's skull-base tumor remains operable.

Kelly underwent surgery in Buffalo last June to remove cancerous cells from his upper jaw.

The chemotherapy and radiation will target cancer cells in his maxillary sinus and adjacent tissues.

In
 11 seasons with the Bills, Kelly appeared in four consecutive Super 
Bowls in the 1990s. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame 
in 2002.

Kelly recently attributed his strength to his faith.

'There is no way I’d be here without my faith,' he told MMBQ.com. “It’s been such a roller coaster. So many things. The Super Bowl losses, the fabulous career, my son born sick, making the Hall of Fame, my son dying, two plates and 10 screws in my back after major surgery, one plate and six screws in my neck after another surgery, a double hernia, the cancer, surgery on my jaw, the cancer coming back, now what I’m facing.'

Kelly also admitted to MMBQ his treatment program faces multiple challenges, and that he hopes it works.

'I hope so. I just know there’s a lot of work to do, to shrink the cancer,' he said. 'I just pray it works.'

Doctors earlier said the aggressive cancer is ‘very treatable and potentially curable,’ but that surgery is not the optimal treatment for the former Buffalo Bills star.

Wife Jill earlier said the radiation and cancer will occur due to ‘complexity and aggressive nature of [Jim's] cancer.'

Writing on her Facebook page, Mrs Kelly said: ‘At this point and time surgery is not the best option for Jim.

‘Because of complexity and aggressive nature of this cancer and after more scans and tests, the plan has changed.

‘At this point, Jim will not be having surgery. The cancer is in areas that surgery cannot successfully eradicate.

‘Therefore,
 the medical specialists here in NYC along with our Buffalo team believe
 that chemotherapy and radiation are the best option.’

The
 news of the change in treatment came as the football player's 
daughter, Erin Kelly, posted two heartbreaking pictures of her dad.

Heartbreaking: In another picture, Kelly is seen walking in a hospital ward. 'So thankful that he was up for a little walk today!!! God is good!!!! And He HEALS!!!!' Erin wrote

In one, she's sitting with Kelly on 
his hospital bed. The comment reads: 'Watching the Syracuse game with 
daddy... he's my buddy! Love him so much!!'

In another, Kelly is seen walking, assisted, in his hospital ward.

'So thankful that he was up for a little walk today!!! God is good!!!! And He HEALS!!!!' Erin wrote.

Wife Jill wrote on her personal blog nearly two weeks ago that 'the cancer's back, aggressive, and starting to spread.'

Buffalo: Kelly, shown left at 1992's Super Bowl, spent 11 seasons with the Bills before retiring following the 1996 season. He has since made Buffalo his home

The Erie County Medical Center in 
Buffalo reiterated the sad news in a statement, adding that the cancer 
was found when the former Buffalo Bills star came in for follow-up 
testing after last June's oral surgery.

The
 statement said the hospital's head and neck cancer specialists were 
determining a course of treatment.

Kelly spent 11 seasons with the Bills before retiring following the 1996 season. He has since made Buffalo his home and former teammates Thurman Thomas, Bruce Smith, and Andre Reed recently visited the former quarterback.

Kelly and his family have asked that people keep them in their thoughts and prayers.

The cancer battle is not the first tragedy for the family. Kelly's son, Hunter, was born with Krabbe disease, an inherited nervous system disorder. Given little more than three years to live, Hunter died at the age of 8 in 2005.
