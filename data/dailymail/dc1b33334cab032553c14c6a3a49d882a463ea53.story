In the latest instalment of his weekly column, chief sports writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the sporting issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver...

WHAT'S HOT

SERGIO AGUERO 

Talking to Ferran Soriano, chief executive of Manchester City, on Sheikh Mansour’s brother’s yacht last weekend – just thought I’d get that one in – he advanced the probability that Chelsea’s run would be curtailed by injury at some stage this season. That Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas would miss the odd game, and this would slow them down.

Leaving aside the fact that Costa did not play between October 5 and November 1, in which time Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 2-1, Maribor 6-0, drew 1-1 at Manchester United and eliminated Shrewsbury Town from the Capital One Cup, there is another flaw in that argument. Couldn’t the same be said of Sergio Aguero? And without Aguero, where would City be?

Sergio Aguero was in scintillating form for Manchester City against Bayern Munich on Tuesday night

After his hat-trick against Bayern Munich, that is now 17 goals in all competitions for the Manchester City striker, a phenomenal return. To put that run into perspective, his nearest colleague has four. The rest of the team put together have 21.

Costa is in outstanding form for Chelsea, too, but he has six fewer goals than Aguero in four fewer appearances. Costa is averaging a goal every 0.78 games. Impressive. Aguero is up at 0.94. He is the one that needs the cotton wool wrap.

EASTERN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL STADIUMS

Vasil Levski was a Bulgarian revolutionary and national hero from the 19th century. Executed by the Ottomans in 1873, his interest in football would have been negligible. He gave his name to a mean stadium, though.

The pitch is rubbish, the bitter cold nobody’s friend but, oh, those floodlights. Oblong, intense, illuminating a monolithic, Soviet-influenced concrete bowl with a running track for the other sports, the minute you saw them, you knew you couldn’t be anywhere but Eastern Europe.

I can remember visiting the Dinamo Stadium, Minsk, when England played in Belarus. Dinamo is a multi-sport club founded in the Soviet Union (this is why so many teams with that name have the same badge), meaning their influence goes far beyond football. In the entrance hall of Dinamo Stadium was a plaque commemorating all of the Minsk athletes that had won gold medals at the Olympic Games. It was huge and all were celebrated equally, summer and winter. And there I found it, written in Cyrillic script, but recognisable. 1972: O. Korbut. Now that’s history.

NIGHT GAMES

Or Night Games: Sex, Power And A Journey Into The Dark Heart Of Sport to give its full title. The winner of the William Hill Sports Book of the Year is the work of Anna Krien, an Australian writer who uses the rape trial of an Australian Rules footballer as the starting point for an exploration of sport’s dangerous casual misogyny. 'Treating women like s*** shades into a culture of abuse, which in turn can shade into rape,' Krien concludes. It should be essential reading at all football clubs in the post-Ched Evans era.

WHAT'S NOT

SPORTS PERSONALITY OF THE YEAR

Why is it that whenever a British athlete does something exceptional, his success is viewed through the prism of Sports Personality of the Year? It’s a public vote, a lame popularity contest, no different to X Factor. It does not matter if Lewis Hamilton wins it or not; what he did in Abu Dhabi was exceptional. It will stand.

UEFA GROUP TABLES

If you have devised a system that is so complex even you can’t work it out, maybe it is time for a change. UEFA think that Manchester City are third in Group E. They’re not. They’re bottom. And this is why. The first method of differentiating between teams on the same points is to use their results, head to head. Roma, CSKA Moscow and Manchester City all have five points. But Roma have a better head-to-head record against Moscow, who are better head to head than City. City and Roma have yet to play their second game.

So why are City in third place? According to UEFA, alphabetical order. They don’t use the head-to-head calculations until all games have been completed. So, from the top, it’s R for Roma, M for Manchester City, C for CSKA Moscow. These people clearly did not watch Sesame Street. But, wait, there’s more. UEFA have their official team listings in Group E as AS Roma, Manchester City and PFC CSKA Moskva. So that explains it. To be on the safe side in future, Manchester City may wish to change their name to AAAAA Manchester City. You know, like plumbers in the Yellow Pages.

Manchester City are bottom of their group but know a win in Rome is likely to send them through

SOUTHAMPTON, STRANGELY

Paul Mitchell, head of recruitment, has decamped for Tottenham Hotspur – a club that may be gearing up to spend two years in exile at Milton Keynes – while Morgan Schneiderlin is again talking about leaving at the end of the season. Hello? Have you lot looked at a league table lately? 

The next month is going to be tough, starting with Sunday’s game against Manchester City – but the biggest hindrance to Southampton’s advancement right now would appear to be the doubts of those inside the club. What happened to daring to dream?
