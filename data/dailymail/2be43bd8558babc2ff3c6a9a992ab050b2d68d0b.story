Fiji is to scrap the public holiday to mark The Queen’s birthday because the government there believes she is irrelevant.

Officials on the former colony also said the move, which comes 25 years after the country was made a republic, was because the day off was a ‘burden’ for the country.

The Queen’s likeness had already been removed from Fijian coins and has been replaced with images of local flora and fauna.

Queen no more: Former colony Fiji has decided to scrap The Queen's birthday public holiday because the government believes it to be irrelevant

Fijians will now only have nine public holidays a year from 2013. 

The Queen’s birthday had been celebrated early in June as opposed to her real birthday on April 21 and was particularly valued by low paid workers as a chance to take a break and be with their families.

Jone Usamate, a spokesman for the Labour Ministry in the capital, Suva, said: ‘The Queen’s birthday’s importance disappeared from Fiji when we became a republic and now our status is an independent nation.

No importance: While The Queen drew huge patriotic crowds here for the Jubilee, in Fiji she holds no relevance since the country became a republic, officials say

‘There is a focus on more productivity and growth, so as a result the decision was made to cut down on the number of holidays in Fiji, as holidays can be a burden on business and government.’

Unrest: Fiji has undergone a period of unrest and in 2006 the military led by now Fijian leader Voreqe Bainimarama ousted the government

Whilst The Queen ceased to be the ruler of Fiji when it became a republic in 1987, its Great Council of Chiefs continued to honour her until now.

Other former British-ruled countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada still mark her birthday with a public holiday.

Fiji has undergone a period of unrest in recent years and in 2006 the military ousted the government which its commanders had installed in 2000 in the last such upheaval.

In 2009 Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations, a move supported by Britain, because of its failure to hold elections, which it still has not done today.

Polls are now scheduled for 2014.

Fijian leader Voreqe Bainimarama made sure the currency's new designs of its ten coin and note denominations did not feature the Queen.

He said in 2011 when the new designs were announced: 'Important and iconic flora and fauna of Fiji has been selected to replace her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's portrait.
