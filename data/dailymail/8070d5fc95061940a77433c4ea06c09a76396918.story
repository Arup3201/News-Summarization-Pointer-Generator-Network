The wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist has revealed the murderer's heart 'burned' to join the militants as she boasted of her easy escape to Syria in an ISIS magazine. 

Hayat Boumeddiene has spoken to Dar al Islam, an online magazine for French speakers, designed to encourage more people to travel to ISIS-controlled land in the Middle East. 

In the issue - which focuses on the Paris attacks - she speaks lovingly of her husband, Amedy Coulibaly, the man who killed five people in two separate attacks during the three days on terror which gripped the French capital last month.

Boumeddiene - who is never referred to by name: only as the wife of Abou Basir Abdoullah Al-Ifriqi, the name given to her husband, and then 'the sister' - also speaks of her escape from France, and encourages others to join her in 'the Caliphate'.

Speaking of Coulibaly, France's most wanted woman revealed: 'His heart burned to join his brothers and fight with them against the enemies of Islam in the Caliphate.

'His eyes shone every time he saw the videos of ISIS and he said, 'don't show me this', because he wanted to leave immediately.' 

Coulibaly never made it to ISIS-controlled Syria, but Boumeddiene left France for the war-torn country before the shootings.

In the interview, she boasts of the ease of her journey - and reveals she is happy in her new life.

'I found it easy to get here - I didn't encounter any difficulties,' she said. 'And it is good to live on land which is under the laws of Islam.'

She then calls on others to follow in her footsteps.

'My brothers and sisters, I call on you to come to the State of Ummah [a land of an Islamic community], to cross the the world and to act guided by the Koran,' she says.

She also has advice for women on how to be a good ISIS wife. 

'Sisters, be there for your husbands, your brothers, your fathers, and sons Be good advisers, then they will find in you tranquility,' she said.

'Don't make it difficult for them, facilitate their choices, be strong and courageous. All you do, do it exclusively for All and hope for recompense.

'Be aware that if the companions have spread Islam across the world, there was a pious women behind them.

'Don't waste your time on futility.' 

The authenticity of the interview has not been confirmed - but it is the second time Boumeddiene has apparently appeared in ISIS propaganda material in recent days.

It is thought she appeared in a video of masked jihadists encouraging people to attack France again.
