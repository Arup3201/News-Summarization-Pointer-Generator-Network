There was a moment before kick-off when Nigel Pearson let it be known to the officials that he thought Swansea’s goals were too big and a measuring tape was brought out. Had he called for a bricklayer, it’s unlikely that he would have improved the result.

Not with finishing as sharp as Wilfried Bony’s and moves as slick and quick as the two that made his goals.

Even with all the possession Leicester managed — 51 per cent, which is no small achievement in these parts — they rarely looked like scoring. When Esteban Cambiasso had an open goal in stoppage time, he hit the post.

It’s why Pearson puffed out his cheeks as he considered a fourth game without victory since that remarkable toppling of Manchester United last month. It’s why Garry Monk afforded himself a big grin after a week of big statements and mild controversy.

While the past six days had been spent absorbing the fallout of his claim that Stoke’s Victor Moses cheated and his assertion that referees are not fair to Swansea, this was merely a convincing win with no incident worth complaining about.

‘It’s quite boring,’ Monk joked. Pearson was rather more subdued. ‘We didn’t perform as well as we should have done,’ he said. ‘We didn’t manage the ball well enough. You can ill afford to make too many unforced errors. It made it a frustrating afternoon for the players.

‘The bottom line is our baseline performance has to be better. The work ethic we have has always been exceptionally good and here I didn’t feel we really gave as much as we could do to stay in the game. That is the biggest disappointment.’

And on the goal posts? ‘The goalkeepers felt they were a bit high (in the warm-up),’ Pearson said. ‘I thought it was in everyone’s best interest, bearing in mind the controversy Garry has had to deal with this week, to get it checked. It was quite light-hearted.’

The rest of his day was quite heavy going.

His tactic appeared to be sit, stifle and ambush, and two thirds of the plan were occasionally effectively. But with no obvious proficiency for getting the ball from back to front, Leicester spent most of the first half inviting pressure.

                               MINS PLD    KM    MILES

Swansea City                           111.1    69.0

Sung-Yueng Ki              90         11.9      7.4

Angel Rangel                90          11.2      6.9

Jonjo Shelvey                90          11.1      6.9

Leicester City                           114.4    71.1

Riyad Mahrez                90          11.8      7.3

David Nugent                 90          11.8      7.3

Leonardo Ulloa              90          11.1      6.9

Swansea took the lead in the 34th minute. The goal was a brilliant blur. Angel Rangel took possession on the right and fed a ball to Bony, whose backheel inside Liam Moore found Sigurdsson. The Iceland forward returned a pass to Bony and the striker scored in his third successive match.

Now, Leicester needed to attack and Swansea needed to avoid giving away a lead for a third straight game. The Leicester rush was instant and within two minutes of the second half they hit the bar, albeit directly from a Liam Moore throw, so it wouldn’t have counted.

In the 57th minute Bony got his second after another move dominated by the excellence of Sigurdsson and the finishing of the Ivorian.

Jefferson Montero rolled the ball to Sigurdsson, who threaded a quite brilliant pass back to the winger. Montero squared and Bony notched his 20th career Premier League goal.

Monk concluded: 'It was about getting three points as we could feel that little bit of pressure on us within the crowd and amongst the players.

'It was never going to be easy, especially when Leicester threw caution to the wind, and we could have controlled the ball a bit better in the second half, but I thought we deserved it.

'We limited them to shots from distance which is credit to the shape we've been working on and how hard defensively we've been working.

'Three goals we've conceded in the last two games - two against Newcastle and the second one against Stoke - has not been the standard we've set but we got back to that to keep a clean sheet.'

Jonjo Shelvey nearly made it three with a 20-yard drive against the bar and Paul Konchesky went to ground to stop Wayne Routledge. 

The winger went down, Monk’s arms went up, but no whistle, no controversy.

‘I am very pleased with the three points, a deserved win,’ Monk said. 

‘There was a little bit of pressure on us to get the win but I am very pleased to get two very well worked goals against a determined side.’
