With her baby bump clearly visible, this is desperate Fiona Anderson as she drops off the keys to the flat where her three young children lay dead.

The chilling CCTV images show the 23-year-old who was seven months pregnant as she arrived at the house where her ex-boyfriend was staying, less than two hours before she fell to her death.

Miss Anderson, who it is thought had one of the children's teddy bears in her pocket, was unable to speak to Craig McLelland, 24, who she believed had left her for another woman.

CCTV shows Fiona Anderson at the Fyffe Centre early on the morning that she died

She appeared to try the door at the building which is home to St John's Housing Trust

Thirty seconds later she left the building - less than two hours later her body was found

Instead she handed over the keys to someone else and told him to give the keys to Mr McLelland.

Unbeknown to anyone, the couple's 
children Levina, three, Addy, two, and 11-month-old Kyden were already 
lying dead in the rented flat a quarter of a mile away.

The footage taken at 6:20am then shows Miss Anderson looking resigned as she walks away from the house.

At 8am she was found dead after she fell 40ft to her death from a car park roof in Lowestoft, Suffolk, on Monday.

Police then went to her flat half a mile away at 11:20am and discovered the bodies of her children.

It is thought that she may have wanted Mr McLelland, who she stabbed during a row the night before, to have found the bodies.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed today that it would not be investigating Suffolk Police over the death of Miss Anderson and her children.

Deaths: Suffolk Police have confirmed that officers briefly spoke to Fiona Anderson, pictured, hours before the tragedy

Loss: Fiona Anderson, aged in her early 20s, is believed to have been heavily pregnant when she died. Her three children were found dead at her home three hours after she fell from the car park

Yesterday, Miss Anderson's family said
they wished more had been done to recognise their daughter's mental 
health problems as friends claimed social services had turned their back
on her.

Her parents paid tribute to their 
'loving and caring' daughter who they said had suffered from mental 
illness since she was young.

Michael and Kerry Anderson and her sisters Claire and Laura Anderson said that 'life was sometimes overwhelming' for her.

In a statement, they said: 'Fiona was a
beautiful, intelligent girl and a loving and caring person, but she had
suffered from mental illness since she was young and we believe she was
driven to her actions yesterday.

'This was not our Fiona - she was not 
herself. She cared passionately about others but often brought stress on
herself by caring too much. She was gentle but ended up under too much 
pressure.

'As a family we were close but she 
would often push us away, keen to do her own thing and not to listen 
when we offered support. Life was sometimes overwhelming for her.'

They added: 'She was really popular 
but just didn't believe she was and had forgotten there were people 
there that could help her.

'We wish more had been done to recognise her mental health problems.'

Friends have claimed that when she died, Miss Anderson was in despair after social services failed to help her.

Showna Elliott, 27, said: 'I know she 
went to social services to ask for help, but they started investigating 
her and threatening to take her children away.

'It looks like she was chronically depressed. She needed help, but she didn't get it.

Neighbour Karleigh Burlingham, 20, added: 'When she went to them for help they turned their back.'

Suffolk social services said that they
are currently investigating the case but did not deny that social 
workers had talked with Miss Anderson about taking her children into 
care.

The incident has been passed to the 
county's independent local Safeguarding Children's Board, 'as is normal 
with this type of incident'.

Sue Cook, director for children and young people at Suffolk County Council, said: 'This is a terrible and very sad incident.

'My thoughts at this time are with the family and all those who knew the mother and children.

'With the police investigation ongoing it would not be appropriate to comment on specifics relating to the family.'

The Independent Police Complaints 
Commission are also investigative after it was revealed officers went to
Miss Anderson's home hours before she fell to her death but she turned 
them away.

They went to her flat in the early hours of Monday morning as they investigated the stabbing of Mr McLelland.

It is thought that Miss Anderson 
stabbed him in a rage at her flat on Monday night, but at the time he 
had told police that he had been stabbed by a man in a nearby street.

A friend of Miss Anderson set up a Facebook page in memory of her and her three children.

The page called R.I.P. Fiona Anderson-Chisholm attracted more than 700 'likes' in two hours after being set up by Lucy Teale.

A
description of the page said: 'No hate just respect! Anyone who knew 
Fiona knew that she was a warm kindhearted girl who would do anything 
for anyone. ?'

Ms Teale 
wrote: 'I grew up with Fiona and I am beyond devastated that she is 
gone. We shared so many wonderful memories together and I'm blessed to 
have had her in my life.

'This page is for you Fiona. I'm always with you! Now rest in peace with your sweet ones. Lucy xxx'

Those
who joined the site included Samantha Jane Flower who wrote: 'RIP Fiona
