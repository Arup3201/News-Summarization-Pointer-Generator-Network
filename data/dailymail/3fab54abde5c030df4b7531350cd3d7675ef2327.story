This is the dramatic moment police targeting ‘modern-day slavery’ battered their way into the first of nine brothels in a major overnight raid.

Five people were arrested on suspicion of managing a brothel while five more women, believed to be victims of sexual exploitation, were freed and taken into care following the raids in Birmingham.

Officers barged their way into the properties using battering rams last night, with three properties recently abandoned when they arrived - although the criminals had left evidence of their activities.

Raids: West Midlands Police officers barged their way into the properties in Birmingham using battering rams

Operation: Five people were arrested (one believed to be pictured left) while five more women (one believed to be pictured right), believed to be victims of sexual exploitation, were freed and taken into care after the raids

Taken away: The five most common countries of origin of potential victims were Romania, Poland, Nigeria, Vietnam and Hungary

Detectives seized phones and other items at the addresses. Video footage shows two officers knocking on one door, before a third with a metal battering ram smashes through the front door.

A figure can be seen on the stairs fleeing the commotion as up to 40 officers storm the house. In total nine addresses were hit by West Midlands Police as part of the long-running Operation Sentinel.

A police spokesman said last year there were 2,255 potential victims of human trafficking identified nationally - an increase of 178 - 9 per cent - compared to those reported in 2011.

The five most common countries of origin of potential victims were Romania, Poland, Nigeria, Vietnam and Hungary.

Detective Superintendent Tim Bacon 
said: ‘It’s hard to believe that modern day slavery is happening in the 
West Midlands, but sadly it’s on the increase and we’re determined to 
put a stop to it.

‘The action, first and foremost, is about protecting people who more often than not don’t even realise that they are victims.

‘But
we’re also sending out a strong message to the traffickers that they’re
not going to get away with using our area as a place to commit this 
appalling abuse.

‘Whilst 
neighbourhood policing teams undertake vital work and build 
relationships within communities to increase reporting, we really need 
people to help us look out for the signs.

‘We will not hesitate to take immediate action when intelligence is received that vulnerable people are being exploited for financial gain.’

Detective Inspector Darren Haynes, from Stechford Criminal Investigation Department in the city, co-orientated the operation.

He said: ‘We were able to carry out these raids because we built up a really good picture of what was going on thanks to information that was coming in from concerned residents and other agencies.

‘Are there are lots of people living and working at the same address? Are they being driven between premises rather than arriving or leaving on foot?

‘Do they have signs of injury, malnourishment and a general unkempt appearance? Are they isolated from the rest of the community? These are just some of the indicators that may help identify potential victims.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
