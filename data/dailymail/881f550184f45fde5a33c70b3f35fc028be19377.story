Southampton are in meltdown after executive chairman Nicola Cortese quit the club amid a bitter dispute with owner Katharina Liebherr.

The club now faces the distinct possibility of losing its impressive manager and star players, with England forward Rickie Lambert perhaps the first to go.

Cortese has been forced out after Liebherr, who inherited the club when her father Markus died in 2010, demanded a bigger say in the running of Southampton.

Dejan Lovren on Twiter: 'Thank you Nicola Cortese for everything #respect.'

He resigned just after 7pm, shortly 
after he had persuaded manager Mauricio Pochettino to remain in charge 
of the team for the clash with Sunderland on Saturday.

Pochettino,
 who arrived at Southampton on January 18 last year, has vowed to quit 
St Mary’s in support of Cortese’s decision to resign.

The
 Argentinian coach left the stadium following talks with Cortese, but is
 expected to take the team for Saturday’s game before deciding whether 
to remain in charge. Even if he agrees to stay, he is expected to leave 
at the end of the season.

There
 are now widespread fears among staff at Southampton that Liebherr, who 
has no previous experience of running a football club, will decide to 
sell.

She has appointed 
herself non-executive chairman and released a statement to say that the 
process to find a chief executive to run the business had already 
started.

Incredibly, Cortese was locked in talks with West Ham over the £7million sale of Lambert.

Cortese
 and Lambert were scheduled to meet this morning at the club’s Marchwood
 training centre, but that has been cancelled following Cortese’s 
resignation.

Lambert, 
who has a restricted role in the first team, fears his World Cup hopes 
will be in jeopardy if he does not get regular football.

West Ham are unwilling to meet his £70,000-a-week wage demands but are still keen to sign him.

Some
 of Southampton’s players are furious with developments and a number of 
the prominent members of the squad will consider their positions in the 
wake of Cortese’s departure.

Luke Shaw, who decided to stay last summer despite interest from Chelsea, is wanted by Manchester City and Liverpool.

Liebherr values him at an astonishing £30m and will sell if a club comes in with a bid.

Shaw
 tweeted: ‘Gutted with that news, but would just like to thank Nicola 
Cortese for everything he has done for me and the club! All the best to 
him!’

James Ward-Prowse
 and Calum Chambers, two of the biggest talents to come through the 
club’s academy, will be targeted by top teams.

Relationship: Skipper Adam Lallana talking with Pochettino on the training ground last week

Liebherr said: ‘With great regret we have accepted the resignation of Mr Cortese.

‘He has done a wonderful job at the club and we very much wanted him to stay. A search has now begun for a successor.

‘In
 the meantime, it is business as usual and we will ensure that the 
manager, the team and all the staff at the club have all the help and 
support they need.’

Pochettino,
 who led the club to 14th in the Barclays Premier League last season, 
vowed to quit last summer if Cortese was forced out.

Better than expected: Southampton currently sit in nine points after a terrific first half of the season

Potential: England youngsters such as Luke Shaw (pictured) has made Southampton an example of how to integrate talent from a club's youth system into the first team

That
 has finally happened after Liebherr informed Cortese at the end of last
 year that she intended to have more say in running the club.

Cortese,
 who was retained as executive chairman by the trust when Markus 
Liebherr died, had previously resisted her attempts to take a bigger 
role.

The Italian 
banker, who said goodbye to staff before loading his car with his 
possessions and departing, wanted more investment to fulfil the ambition
 of playing Champions League football.
