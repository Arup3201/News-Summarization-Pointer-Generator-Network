Arsenal have sent young midfielder Jack Jebb on a month's loan to Stevenage.

The 19-year-old has yet to play for the Gunners' senior side and will be hoping to gain experience in League Two.

Jebb scored three goals in five games as Arsenal Under 18s reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup last season.
