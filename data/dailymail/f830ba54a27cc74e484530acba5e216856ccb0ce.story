Professor Linda Hogan, pictured last year giving an honorary medal to American Pie actor Seann Scott, is tipped as a candidate to become the first female cardinal

An Irish feminist is causing a stir in the Catholic world as rumours are rife the married 49-year-old could be set to join the world's 'most exclusive' club.

Linda Hogan is being tipped as a contender to become the Vatican's first female cardinal.

A woman has never held the title, and while current precedence states only ordained men can be appointed to the role, Pope Francis could be poised to make history.

The leader of the Catholic church, elected eight months ago, has emerged as a liberal prompting speculation he will invite a woman to don the red hat and welcome the first female cardinal into the Vatican's fold.

The reformist Argentinian pope has made no secret of the fact he aims to increase the role of women in the church, calling for 'a truly deep theology of women'.

For 700 years a pope was free to elect whoever they wished to the role of cardinal. Pope Alexander VI made his illegitimate son, Cesare Borgia, a cardinal when he was 18 years old.

Historians say no woman has sat in the Holy See's papal conclave since the position was created in the 12th Century and cardinals were given the responsibility of electing the pope.

In 1917 a canon law instructed that a pope could only appoint ordained men as cardinals.

But church historians believe Pope Francis could simply set aside that law and select a female cardinal should he wish to.

A former Brazilian priest, Juan Arias, was the man who first put forward the prospect of an imminent appointment of a female cardinal, when he wrote the idea was 'not a joke', in the Spanish newspaper El Pais in September.

He quoted an unnamed priest as saying: 'Knowing this Pope, he wouldn't hesitate before appointing a woman cardinal.

'And he would indeed enjoy being the first Pope to allow women to participate in the selection of a new pontiff,' The Sunday Times reported.

However, Father Federico Lombardi, the Pope's spokesman, has moved to downplay the speculation.

He said last week: 'Stay calm, no nominations of women cardinals are due.'

Pope Francis is expected to name at least 14 new cardinals ahead of his first consistory - a formal meeting of the Sacred College of Cardinals - in February.

The conclave currently consists of 100 elderly males, criticised in recent years for their mismanagement of child abuse scandals.

And while the debate rages, Professor Hogan, the vice-provost of Trinity College Dublin, is leading the pack of potential candidates for the historic post.

While the academic has refrained from commenting on the speculation, colleagues have revealed her strong interest in theology, ethics and human rights.

Gina Menzies, a Dublin theologian, said: 'She'd be quite radical.

'One of her strong beliefs is something Pope Francis has been hinting at, too: that the basis of moral theology starts from human experience.'

Hogan, who was a founding member of the International Association for Catholic Social Thought, is one of nine potential female cardinals listed by friend James Keenan, professor of theology at the Jesuit Boston College, on his Facebook page.

Along with Professor Hogan, two candidates are from Brazil, three are African, one is Australian, another German and the ninth is from the Philippines.

Were one of these women to be elected to the role by Pope Francis, they would become the most prominent and influential female in the Catholic Church, and could one day be elected to succeed the man who bestowed the honour upon them.
