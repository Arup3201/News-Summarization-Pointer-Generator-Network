Wow, it’s hot! I'm a glass-half-full sort of girl and try to see the good in any situation.

Yes, it's been hot and humid for the last few weeks. And, yes, it can get grimy during summer in the city (even in Chelsea!) but I prefer to look on the bright side and think hot days and nights mean hot fun..

But there is one side of this humid weather that's been getting me down. My make-up keeps sliding off! I'll start the day looking picture-perfect, but when I get home my face is shiny, my mascara has smudged around my eyes, and my lipstick has disappeared!

It may be hot outside but Binky Felstead has perfected make-up that will last all day long

My make-up skills can't compete with the weather, so I've decided once again to consult cosmetics pro Daniel Sandler to find out how to bullet-proof my look.

Make-up expert Daniel has beautified countless celebrity faces, creating gorgeous looks that will stand up to the heat and dazzle of mega-watt movie lights. If anyone can heat-proof and sweat-proof my make-up, Daniel can.

How To Bulletproof Your Makeup

Start with a fresh, clean face. Avoid too much moisturiser as this can eat away at your make-up during the day; just lightly blend Daniel Sandler Retexturizing Face Primer all over your face.

This is the most important part of the process to ensure your make-up stays put through the day, as the primer will lock your cosmetics in place and also help smooth out fine lines. Next blend Stila's Prime Pot lid primer across the eyelids to form a long-lasting base for eyeshadow.

Run a navy blue eyeliner along the upper lash line. Then apply a green eyeliner to the lower waterline before smudging it

Apply Daniel Sandler Invisible Radiance Foundation onto the face, aiming for a fresh, light coverage to even out your skin tone. Now dab a touch of Daniel Sandler's Watercolour Blusher in So Pretty onto the cheeks with your fingertip, blending it into the foundation. You only need a tiny blob of this product - it's a fluid blusher and it's water-resistant, which means it has serious staying power. Alternatively, use a cream blusher and fix it in place with translucent powder.

Run a navy blue eyeliner along the upper lash line. Then apply a green eyeliner to the lower waterline before smudging it with a small brush to soften the effect. Using waterproof products like the Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliners will give your make-up that extra longevity – I’ve used the shades Blue Velvet and Green Velvet.

Brush Stila Forever Your Curl mascara onto your lashes for a really long-lasting, smudge-proof result. Waterproof mascara can be tricky to remove, but a clever little make-up artist's trick is to apply ordinary mascara first then add a coat of waterproof mascara. This makes it easier to remove at the end of the evening.

Define your eyebrows with Stila's Stay All Day Waterproof Brow Colour and groom them into place with a brush.

Rub Daniel Sandler's Invisible Veil Powder into your hands and press it onto your face. This will fix your products in place without giving a heavily powdered feel.

The finished make-up look that Daniel has created for me feels lightweight and lovely, and that's part of the magic. Layers of heavy base and thick powder are bound to turn greasy and slide off in the heat.

A naturally pretty effect - created with long-lasting products - will look good from dawn till dusk with the minimum of touch-ups. Thanks Daniel!

If you have a big party or important event coming up, it's well worth investing in really good quality, long-stay make-up to ensure you look your best. Head to online beauty boutique escentual.com to find all the products Daniel used for this look. Now I'm off to road-test the results. See you on the dance floor tonight... I'll be the girl still looking great when things get steamy!Stay gorgeous...Love Binky xxx
