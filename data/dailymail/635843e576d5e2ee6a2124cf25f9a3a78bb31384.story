It's been called a 
David vs. Goliath story, a 'Tale of Two Arthurs' and even the 'ultimate 
Greek tragedy,' but the characters in this drama are not Biblical or 
literary figures.

They're grocery store owners.

A
 workers' revolt at the Market Basket supermarket chain has led to empty
 shelves, angry customers and support for a boycott from more than 100 
state legislators and mayors.

Market Basket supermarket employees and supporters hold a rally Friday to back ousted former CEO Arthur T. Demoulas

A decades-long family feud, which brought about the ouster of Arthur T. Demoulas as CEO of the privately held company, led to a worker revolt, customer boycotts and empty shelves in the grocery chain's stores in Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire

Industry 
analysts say worker revolts at non-union companies are rare, but what's 
happening at Market Basket is particularly unusual because the workers 
are not asking for higher pay or better benefits.

They are demanding the
 reinstatement of beloved former CEO Arthur T. Demoulas, whom they 
credit with keeping prices low, treating them well and guiding the 
company's success.

The New England grocery store chain is embroiled in a family feud featuring two cousins who have been at odds for decades.

While
 earlier squabbles between Arthur T. Demoulas and Arthur S. Demoulas 
were fought in courtrooms, this dispute has spilled into the stores.

For
 the past week, warehouse workers have refused to make deliveries to 
Market Basket stores, leaving fruit, vegetable, seafood and meat shelves
 empty.

Workers have held huge protest rallies and organized boycott 
petitions through social media, attracting thousands of supporters.

Customers
 are defecting to other grocery stores. In some cases, customers have 
taped receipts from competitors to Market Basket windows.

'We
 are going to go somewhere else from now on,' said Soraya DeBarros, as 
she walked through a depleted produce department at the Market Basket in
 West Bridgewater this week. 'I'm sad about it because of course I want 
to keep the low prices, but I want to support the workers.'

Despite
 threats by new management to fire any workers who fail to perform their
 duties, 300 warehouse workers and 68 drivers have refused to make 
deliveries.

Eight supervisors have been fired.

The
 new executives have assured workers they are not planning drastic 
changes in the way the company is operated and have urged them to return
 to work.

On Friday, the company again 
appealed to workers to return, saying they won't be punished or face any
 change in compensation and benefits.

'We welcome back associates who are committed to Market Basket's customers,' it said in a statement.

'If
 you had told me that workers at a grocery store would walk out to save 
the job of a CEO, I would say that's incredible. There is usually such a
 gulf between the worker and the CEO,' said Gary Chaison, a professor of
 industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester.

Market
 Basket stores have long been a fixture in Massachusetts. The late 
Arthur Demoulas - grandfather of Arthur S. and Arthur T. and a Greek 
immigrant - opened the first store in Lowell nearly a century ago.

Gradually, Market Basket became a regional powerhouse, with 25,000 
employees and 71 stores in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine.

The
 feud dates back to the 1970s, but the most recent round of infighting 
began last year when Arthur S. gained control of the board of directors.
 Last month, the board fired Arthur T., sparking the current uprising.

Workers are fiercely loyal to Arthur T.

'You
 know the movie, `It's a Wonderful Life.' He's George Bailey,' said Tom 
Trainor, a district supervisor who worked for the company for 41 years 
before being fired last weekend over the protests. 'He's just a 
tremendous human being that puts people above profits. He can walk 
through a store, and if he's met you once, he knows your name, he knows 
your wife, your husband, your kids, where they are going to school.'

Earlier Friday, board members said they will consider an offer Arthur T. made this week to buy the company.

'Consistent
 with its fiduciary obligations, the Board will evaluate and seriously 
consider this proposal, along with any other offers previously received 
and to be received,' the board said.

The board also decried what it called the 'negative behavior' of some current and former employees.

'It
 is now clear that it is in the interests of all members of the Market 
Basket community for normal business operations to resume immediately,' 
it said.

As the board met, up to 10,000 
employees, customers and supporters attended another protest rally at a 
Market Basket store in Tewksbury.

Employees 
said they believe the fight between the family members loyal to Arthur 
T. and Arthur S. is largely over money and the direction of the company.

They say Arthur S. and his supporters have pressed for a greater return
 to shareholders.

Arthur T. and his supporters have focused on keeping prices low.

Many
 employees are distrustful of Arthur S. and two co-chief executives who 
were brought in from outside the company: Felicia Thornton, a former 
executive of the grocery chain Albertsons, and Jim Gooch, former 
president and chief executive at RadioShack Corp.

Arthur S. has not spoken publicly about his ouster or the striking workers supporting him

The company statement Friday acknowledged 'the strain this change of leadership has placed on our associates.'

Valerie Burke, a worker in the West Bridgewater store, said she's worried about her job.

'It's
 a great company to work for now, but we are worried it won't stay that 
way,' she said as she picketed outside the store Tuesday.

Arthur S. has not spoken publicly, while Gooch and Thornton have communicated only through prepared statements.

Steve
 Paulenka, who started in 1974 as a bag boy and rose to facilities and 
operations manager before being fired last weekend, said he sees no end 
to protests unless Arthur T. is reinstated.

'A
 big part of me doesn't like what's going on - it's like breaking your 
favorite toy on purpose,' he said. 'But we'll get through this.'
