Billionaire investor Warren Buffett posted a rare tweet on Sunday to share his love of Emmy-award winning series Breaking Bad.

Buffett, the world's third richest man, tweeted a picture of himself dressed as the show's main character Walter White, complete with wide-brimmed felt hat, glasses and goatee.

The 82-year-old looked the spitting image of White, played by Bryan Cranston. Buffett wrote: 'Not even the Oracle knows what will happen tonight. #waltsuccessor'

Buffett, a billionaire philanthropist known as 'the Oracle of Omaha', was among millions of fans showing their love for Breaking Bad as its hit run came to an end on AMC on Sunday evening.

The 75-minute final episode of Breaking Bad was written and directed by show creator Vince Gilligan and it somehow managed to live up to the hype.

Variety said the show's finale 'perfectly capped a final arc that was all forward momentum, with barely an ounce of fat on it, and almost nary a false note.'

Buffett wasn't the only famous face tweeting his disappoint that Breaking Bad was finally over.

Hollywood heavyweights took to Twitter to mourn the end of the drama, which (spoiler alert) didn't end well for teacher turned meth manufacturer, Walter White.

Ellen DeGeneres tweeted: '#BreakingBad ends tonight. No more murderous drug dealers and horrifying criminals. I miss it already.'

Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky wrote: 'almost like losing a good friend. congrats to @BreakingBad_AMC a historic run.'

Emmy Rossum isn't ready to let go: '#GoodbyeBreakingBad is breaking my heart. I'm not ready for this. I binge watched over the summer & I'm not ready for it to be over!'
