A giant panda found itself having aimed a little too high when it got stuck up a spruce tree in northwest China.

The panda bear had been caught helping itself to sweetcorn by a farmer's dogs and was chased up the tree by the pack.

Despite pandas being excellent climbers, this particular one became stuck amidst the branches after the crowd gathered below gave it stage fright.

Stage fright: The panda became stuck after being chased up the tree by a pack of dogs in Zhouzhi county, northwest China's Shaanxi province

Long fall: The panda is barely visible among the top branches of the tree as a net is put up below it

Helping hands: Firemen and local residents got together to catch the panda should it fall out of the treetop

The farmer whose crops the panda had been helping itself to called the fire services when the locals begun to fear it might fall out of the tree.

Firemen and locals in Zhouzhi county, in China's Shaanxi province, put up a net to catch the panda if it fell, and then left it alone to climb down under its own steam.

A staff member from the local nature reserve in  said: 'We identified this giant panda as a 10 years old male, and the nets were not really needed.

‘The panda is good at climbing, I have never heard of one falling off a tree. All that was needed was that people do not stand around and let the panda free to leave without a crowd.’

Suit yourself: The panda had been stealing sweetcorn from a local farmers field when it was chased up the tree

Staying put: The scared panda remained safely in the treetop, refusing to climb down, let alone jump

Up he goes: One of the local farmers inspects the tree trunk bearing the markings of the panda

Sticky situation: The panda did not come down until the crowd has dispersed, but reportedly returned safely to the nearby woods

The panda later made it down on its own after the crowd had dispersed for the night, and safely made it back to the woods.

Giant pandas are solitary bears when in the wild, usually preferring their own company when foraging in Chinese bamboo forests.

They are an endangered species, with less than 2,000 thought to be left roaming free in the cool forests that are their natural habitat.

They mostly eat bamboo, but in captivity are also enjoy being fed honey, eggs, fish, yams, leaves, oranges, bananas and other special treats.
