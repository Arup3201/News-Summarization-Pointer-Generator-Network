Eat your heart out E,L. James, there's a new writer in town and she set to get pulses racing with her own erotic fiction.

23-year-old Aura Borealis from London has self-penned and self-published part 1 of her trilogy, Xoxo Lisa #1 under her pseudonym Lola Pulse.

The beauty blogger and aspiring fashion designer was a runner up in the 2007 Princess Beauty Pageant, which was held in the Czech Republic.

After her degree in fashion marketing, which will see Aura launch her own line of silk scarves in August, she started writing children's, young adult and erotic fiction.

But far from the naive and submissive character of Anastasia 
Steel in the 50 Shades of Grey series, Lola Pulse’s story centres around a 
high-flying, high earning, anonymous city blogger.

Racy read: Xoxo Lisa #1 was published earlier this month by Lola Pulse

In the book, available to download now on Kindle through Amazon, Lisa starts writing about her sexual 
escapades online and swiftly builds up a loyal fan base who can't seem 
to get enough of her steamy adventures.

And Aura is quick to point out that her heroine is nothing like Anastasia.

'I think we've all had enough of clumsy 
girls chasing after billionaires,' says Aura.

'I wanted to write something with a 
strong female voice. It’s very racy, but has a light sense of humour 
about it, completely different from 50 Shades.'

On what her friends and family think of her latest career path, Aura says: 'It’s definitely raised a few eyebrows, but generally, they don’t mind me writing erotic fiction, we just haven’t told the church pastor yet!'

Aura’s blog, www.auraborealiswrites.com currently boasts over 50,000 followers and she’s recently launched A Book to the Heart, an online campaign encouraging more people to read.

Part 2 of the trilogy, Lethal Kisses (Xoxo Lisa #2) is published on 30 September.

Self publishing has allowed a number of younger writers move up in the literary ranks.

Last month, Anna Todd, 25 from Texas, landed a six figure publishing deal for her One Direction Fan-fiction after racked up millions of reads on the popular writing site Wattpad.

Aura says she has no plans to approach major publishers yet, though has written a teen-fiction novel, Torn, to be published in August. The story centres around her own experiences in secondary school, the breakdown of a friendship and navigating the pressures of adolescence.

'It's a difficult part of life for everyone, but it’s inspired a story, so I don’t complain about it,' says Aura.
