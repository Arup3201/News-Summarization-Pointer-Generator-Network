The number of Americans who believe in God is declining, as a new poll shows a move away from traditional beliefs.

The Harris poll, which questioned more than 2,250 adults about their beliefs, found that those with the strongest faith lived mostly in the South, voted Republican, and were black.

The online poll also showed that more Americans were describing themselves at 'not very religious' and that there was an increase in those believing in Darwin's theory of evolution.

Keeping the faith: While 74 per cent of Americans still believe in God, the number is declining

Belief: A Harris poll in November questioned 2,250 Americans about their thoughts on God, Darwin and UFOs

While the majority of Americans polled (74 per cent) said they believed in God, the figure was down compared to 2005, 2007 and 2009, when 82 per cent believed.

And, where as only 12 per cent of people polled in 2007 described themselves as 'not at all religious' that figure had risen in 2013 to 23 per cent.

A decline from previous years was also seen in those believing in heaven, miracles, the devil, and the virgin birth.

The poll confirmed that most believers were Republicans and those who lived in the South, while the more cynical were 18 to 36-year-olds who lived on the East Coast.

Darwin's theory of evolution was supported by 47 per cent of those questioned, with its biggest supporters being 18 to 36-year-olds and Democrats.Â 

Believers: The poll recorded what Americans believed in this year and in previous years

Believers: The poll broke down the results based on age, gender and education

Philosophy: The poll recorded whether people though God was male or female and how much control, if any, he had

Spirituality: Americans were asked whether they believed everything in the Bible was true and if they considered themselves religious

Unsure: The poll showed a decline in the percentage of people certain there was a God

A decline was also seen in the amount of control God has over Earth, with 37 per cent of those asked, including 52 per cent of Catholics, stating that God observed but had not control.

This has fallen dramatically in the past ten years, when the figure was 50 per cent.

There was evidence of skepticism over magic and aliens, with only 26 per cent of those polled last month saying they believed in witches, 29 per cent believing in astrology and 36 per cent believing in UFOs.
