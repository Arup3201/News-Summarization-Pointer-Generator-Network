A Labour shadow minister yesterday accused Tom Watson of rigging the party's leadership elections.

In a furious Twitter row, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Ivan Lewis suggested the former Labour campaign chief had been responsible for 'manipulating' votes.

The spat resurrected tensions between Blairites and Brownites in the riven party.

Mr Lewis is one of the last remaining Blairites on Ed Miliband's frontbench team, while Mr Watson was a close ally of Gordon Brown during his time as chancellor and then prime minister.

The quarrel broke out after Mr Watson, MP for West Bromwich East, posted a link on Twitter to an article he had written arguing that it would be 'disastrous' if Jim Murphy won the race to be Scottish Labour.

Mr Lewis tweeted: 'It's essential that Scots decide best person to be leader of Scottish Labour. Others interfering not in the interests of the Labour Party.'

Mr Watson responded: 'Presumably you'd rather they quietly elect your candidate whilst we all watch. Plus ca change.'

But Mr Lewis hit back: 'I want party to choose leaders in an open democratic way. Your problem is this is one leadership election you can't manipulate.

'Point is that I was not prepared to let you do it again without challenging you. Some of us have remained silent for too long.'

'How interesting,' Mr Watson added. 'Which ones do you think I manipulated?'

In 2008, after Mr Lewis criticised Mr Brown's tax policies, claims about his 'pestering' a female aide were leaked to the media by Mr Brown's spin-doctor Damian McBride.

Mr Watson was last year accused of using his power in the party to try and install his union-backed office assistant as the candidate in Falkirk.
