The quest for a device that will allow humans to soar like birds has led to some strange contraptions over the years.

But this one could outdo even the most bizarre designs – and you don’t even have to take off from the ground to use it.

The Birdly machine lets you flap your way through the air in a similar way to the red kite that it’s modelled after.

Developed by the Zurich University of the Arts, a motor translates hand movements from a simulator into the flapping of virtual avian wings.

Meanwhile, an Oculus Rift VR headset provides a stomach-churning bird-eye-view of the flight.

If that wasn’t enough, the system also replicates the headwinds that a red kite would face using a fan.

Users will even smell whatever landscape they’re flying over.

‘Soundwise you perceive only the roaring of the wind and the flaps of the wings,’ the designers write on their website.

‘The olfactoric feedback is based on the location which the bird flies over in the scenery and ranges from the scent of a forest, soil, to several other odours of the wilderness.’

The designers claim that Birdly still needs some changes to avoid making the user feel sick.

However, the machine is primarily an art installation and there are no plans to commercialise it.

The device is the latest in a range of concepts designed to make use of the ultra-realistic Oculus Rift headset.

For instance, the Norwegian Army is trialling a system that uses the Oculus Rift headset to drive armoured vehicles without soldiers having to stick their heads above the hatch.

Cameras mounted around the vehicle film its surroundings and this footage is fed to the driver through the headset, creating the illusion that the tank is ‘transparent.

Another project is used the Oculus Rift headset to let you can experience all the loops, jumps and speed of Sonic the hedgehog in first-person.

Facebook's
 virtual world was given the go ahead earlier this year when their $2bn 
(£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved.

Oculus was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey.

The firm is developing the leading VR headset - with a developer version on sale for $350 (£210)

It
 will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and 
communicate.'

But virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg

The
 purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who have already
 unveiled their own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next 
year.

Meanwhile, Swedish broadband provider Ume.net recently unveiled its intriguing experiment.

They programmed the headset to experience internet lag in real life, to give users an idea of what it would be like to live in a world where things buffer like an online video.

The experiment is called 'Living with lag' and sees four volunteers going through activities while using an Oculus Rift together with a Rasperry Pi, webcam and noise-cancelling headphones.

Together, this combination can simulate different levels of lag, from a brief 0.33 seconds to a more frustrating three seconds.

The results are rather hilariously shown in their video, which includes the volunteers struggling to dance and play table tennis.
