If it were all down to looks, Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio would be the clear winners at the Oscars on Sunday.

The handsome pair topped a beauty poll of more than 1,000 Britons to find out who win in the looks department.

Lawrence's American Hustle co-star Amy Adams took second place, while a third member of the cast, Bradley Cooper, came runner up to Leonardo DiCaprio in the men's poll.

All four have been nominated for awards in tonight's Oscars ceremony in Los Angeles, with Lawrence in particular, hotly tipped to take the Best Supporting Actress prize.

Other actresses to feature close to the top of the women's poll included Gravity star Sandra Bullock, in third place on 6.5 per 
cent, and Cate Blanchett and Lupita Nyong'o who got joint fourth with 4.8 per cent 
of the vote.

Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding her half-sister's suicide three weeks ago, Julia Roberts came next with 1.7 per cent.

The men's vote saw Wolf Of Wall Street star Leonardo 
DiCaprio triumph over Bradley Cooper and knock Irish star 
Michael Fassbender down into third place.

Cate Blanchett 4.8 per cent

Lupita Nyong'o 4.8 per cent

Julia Roberts 1.7 per cent

Leonardo DiCaprio 40.1 per cent

Bradley Cooper 33.9 per cent

Michael Fassbender 7.3 per cent

Matthew McConaughey 6.8 per cent

Jared Leto 5.7 per cent

Christian Bale 4.5 per cent

The critically acclaimed Best Actor 
nominee is yet to win an Oscar but the 39-year-old could, for the first time, take home the big prize at tonight's awards ceremony.

But he'll have stiff competition from American Hustle's Bradley Cooper and Michael Fassbender's 12 Years A Slave co-star, Chiwetel Ejiofor.

The two stars of the Dallas Buyers Club, Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, came fourth and fifth in the looks poll, although both are likely to fare better tonight.

The findings are the results of an online poll of 1,100 men and women by online beauty retailer Escentual.com, and focused on the stars nominated for an award at this year's Oscars.

A spokesperson said: 'So much of the Oscars this Sunday is going to be about the glamour and beauty on the red carpet and so we thought we would hold our own Oscars beauty awards before the night.

'Jennifer Lawrence was unanimously chosen by both men and women as the run-away winner for most beautiful actress, but it was a bit more of an open field for the men.

'Nevertheless, Leonardo DiCaprio was a clear head in front of Bradley Cooper for the prize of being the UK's choice for Most Handsome Male.'
