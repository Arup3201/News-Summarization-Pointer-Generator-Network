It started with a spooky, white material which began to randomly appear on trees.

Residents in a London suburban street were left completely baffled by its appearance.

But now, three weeks on, their confusion has turned to horror after discovering the material was in fact caterpillar nests.

It has resulted in a plague of bird cherry ermine caterpillars completely covering pavements, walls and cars in the street.

Odd: A freak plague of caterpillars has invaded a suburban street in south London, covering trees and walls

Invasion: Siblings Charlie and Ava Warren look at some of the caterpillars covering a tree. The infestation is three inches deep in places

Plague:
Residents in the south London street have had to pick the caterpillars
out of their hair and clothes. This picture shows some of the

The infestation, which is three inches 
deep in places, has resulted in residents having to pick the 
animals out their hair and clothes.

Trisha Mole, who lives in Warfield Road, Hampton , said: 'You cannot help but feel they are doing damage to the trees.'

A neighbour added: 'The trees are completely infested. All the trees are dripping in this white chlorophyll web thing.

'We are picking the caterpillars out of our hair and the kids' hair. It's just not on.'

Covered: The caterpillar nests have completely overtaken the street, much to the frustration of local residents

Mess: As well as lining the trees, the nests have spread to the pavements

Not happy: One resident in the street described the infestation as 'unpleasant, really unpleasant'

The Bird-cherry Ermine moth is, unlike many other caterpillars that cause infestations, entirely harmless.

They can be found across the whole of Europe as well as northern and eastern Asia.

Ranging in size from 16 to 25mm long, the live on Bird-cherry trees and make an extensive web like nest.

They can eat an entire tree bare although many trees survive with reduced growth in the following growth seasons.

In 2011, 20 matures trees disappeared under a web of white silk in Birmingham when they experienced an infestation.

Another resident, who did not want to be
named, said: 'We all know that it is not harmful to us, it is just 
really unpleasant, really unpleasant..

'The council is more concerned about the caterpillars than the people.'

Richmond
Council said there were no safe chemicals that could be used in a 
public area to permanently remove the caterpillars.

It said the 
caterpillar feeding stage lasted about four weeks.

A council spokesman said: 'The 
caterpillars are totally harmless to humans, they only feast on the tree
but the trees recover quite quickly once the caterpillars pupate and 
the adults start to fly

'However, we are aware that they have caused the local residents distress and we are investigating what other methods could be used to remove them.'

Councillor Gareth Roberts said: 'Unfortunately, owing to the advanced stage of the infestation, I'm advised by council officers that even if they were to use the treatments they have at their disposal they would have little effect.

Cautious: Richmond Council said there were no safe chemicals that could be used in a public area to permanently remove the caterpillars

The little critters make themselves at home on some brickwork

Due to the advanced stage of the infestation, the treatments available to the council would have little effect

'While I appreciate that this is 
probably of little immediate comfort I get the impression from officers 
that this is something of a freak occurrence and it is unlikely to recur
next year, however I will ask our arboriculture team to monitor this 
street closely so they can act early in case it does.'
