A council clerk who stole £162,000 from taxpayers to fund her 'shopping addiction' was today ordered to pay back less than half.

Patricia Bell, 58, was jailed for 28 months last year after a judge heard she used a special pen to forge cheques while working at Whitehill Town Council in Hampshire.

She tricked councillors she worked for into thinking they were signing legitimate cheques after she had written the correct name using a fabric pen.

Patricia Bell will have to pay back £70,684 of the £162,000 she stole - just 44 per cent

But Bell - who earned £46,000 a year - would then remove the name by heating the ink and replace it with her details.

She used the stolen funds to pay for expensive handbags and holidays, Winchester Crown Court heard.

But today a judge ordered her to pay back just £70,684 at a confiscation hearing - 44 per cent of that stolen.

The married mum-of-two paid £110,000 of altered cheques into her account and transferred another £45,000 of additional cheques including extra salary payments.

Bell also claimed £7,000 worth of expenses including food shopping bills, receipts, and eBay purchases - taking the total to £162,000.

She used the money, which she stole over five years, to fuel her 'shopping addiction' which enabled her to pay for holidays, handbags and nail manicures.

Sentencing judge Linda Sullivan said: 'I 
have no doubt that you maximised the ease of how you were able to take 
this money and you did so in a sophisticated fashion.'

If she fails to settle the bill in six months she will be jailed for a further year.

Once councillors identified financial irregularities an internal investigation was launched and Bell was forced to attend a meeting with senior councillors.

She admitted the allegations were true and was suspended for potential gross misconduct.

The council then commissioned an independent investigator to ascertain the facts of the financial irregularities.

On February 18, 2013, the council dismissed Bell on the grounds she abused procedures to pay herself by falsifying reports, accounts and expense claims.

Bell was then arrested and later charged with fraud by abuse of position.

Anthony Rimmer, defending, claimed his client had worked hard in the public sector up until the incidents that took place from 2007.

He said: 'Mrs Bell had spent 37 years working in the public sector, working for Action for Children and other district councils.

'It was only until she turned 53 that she started doing this. She would often throw away the fabric pens in a bid to stop what she was doing, but ended up buying more.'

The former chairman and treasurer of the Hampshire Society of Local Councils pleaded guilty to one count of fraud by abuse of position.

She sat in the dock with her head down for most of the sentencing, holding a box of tissues throughout.

Bell was wearing a black and grey striped dress and tears streamed down her face when her sentence was read out.

New council clerk Chris Young, 61, worked under Bell and replaced her after she was suspended.

He said: 'She was well presented and always looked very glamorous.

'She would often come into work with a new handbag and her nails and hair were always immaculate.'
