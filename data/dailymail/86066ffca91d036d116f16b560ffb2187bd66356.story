A recently retired Secret Service agent told MailOnline on Thursday that former director Julia Pierson's resignation will be welcomed by the agency's rank-and-file because 'people in the service thought she was a joke from Day One.'

He attributed her swift fall from grace to a cadre of 'p***ed off agents who had had enough' of feeling disrespected by the service's first female director.

'Putting her in charge was part of the [Obama] administration's push to feminize the service after the "hookergate" nightmare,' the agent said, referring to agents who were fired after patronizing prostitutes during a security-check trip to Colombia before President Obama's 2012 visit.

Pierson resigned Wednesday following an angry, tense congressional hearing the day before, which focused on a trio of headaches that erupted in a matter of days.

Julia Pierson stepped down from her role leading the Secret Service on Wednesday following a trip of scandals that a retired agent said were caused by angry agents who 'had had enough' of her

Pierson slashed the number of uniformed Secret Service police who patrol the outer perimeter of the White House complex; a fence-jumper got all the way into the presidential mansion on Sept. 19

The Washington Post published stories last week describing how the Secret Service was unaware for four days that a gunman had fired shots at the White House, including one that broke an upstairs window.

This week more dirt surfaced, including a story in the Washington Examiner about an armed security guard who got into an elevator with Obama during his September visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The president's protective detail, it has emerged, was unaware the man was carrying a gun and hadn't vetted him at all.

Also damaging to the Secret Service was a report that an intruder got far into the White House itself after he scaled the mansion's perimeter fence and sprinted nearly the length of a football field across the lawn and through an unlocked door without being apprehended.

Disgruntled agents and supervisors told the Post that Pierson discussed making the elite corps that guards the president and his family 'more like Disney World' and 'more friendly.'

MailOnline's source said that this caused instant turmoil among long-serving agents, including those in the Presidential Protective Division.

He spoke on condition of anonymity, and said he didn't know who inside the agency had 'sandbagged her' by leaking damaging information to the press.

But he said it was likely a series of deep-seated resentments that ender Pierson's career.

'As soon as she took over' 18 months ago, he said, 'the word was that she wanted to make the service softer and less macho. And that didn't sit well with anybody.'

'Even the female agents are constantly drawing on their inner tough-guy. Anyone who is willing to take a bullet for the president has to be heavy on testosterone, so she really knocked the wind out of us.'

The Post reported Thursday that Pierson had also rejected a plan to assign about 100 countersurveillance agents to patrol the White House's perimeter, instead cutting that number by one-third. 

She also presided over a reduction in the numbers of uniformed Secret Service Police who protect the White House compound from the outside.

And she made the controversial decision to limit the street-level security surrounding this year's U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, erring on the side of allowing more automobile traffic to flow through the nation's capital.

These mistakes, the retired agent said, irked him and his colleagues, including many who were not assigned to the Presidential Protective Division. 

'This is a job where our loyalty to the office of the president trumps everything else,' he told MailOnline.

'What we expected from our leadership was loyalty in return, and Pierson didn't seem to understand that. She hadn't been in the field for a long time. Maybe she just forgot.'

'But cutting down the size of the White House perimeter detail was a morale-killer and I think it came back to bite her.'

A spokeswoman from the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association did not respond to requests for comment about the mood of the union's members during and after Pierson's tenure.
