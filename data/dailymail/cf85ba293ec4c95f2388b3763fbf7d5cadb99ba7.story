Shoppers will soon be heading out to their local stores expecting to buy their jack-o'-lanterns ready for Halloween next month.

But the U.S. Northeast is facing a shortage this year after Hurricane Irene destroyed hundreds of pumpkin patches across the region.

Wholesale prices have doubled in some places as farmers nurse their surviving pumpkin plants toward a late harvest.

Some farmers are even trying to buy pumpkins from other regions to cover orders, after the storm’s impact on crops last month.

‘I think there's going to be an extreme shortage of pumpkins this year,’ said Darcy Pray, owner of Pray's Family Farms in Keeseville, New York.

‘I've tried buying from people down in the Pennsylvania area.

‘I've tried locally here and I've tried reaching across the border to some farmers over in the Quebec area. There's just none around.’

Hurricane Irene raked the U.S. Northeast in August, bringing torrents of rain that overflowed rivers and flooded fields along the East Coast.

Mr Pray saw his entire crop of up to 20,000 pumpkins washed into Lake Champlain. But farmers were having a difficult year even before then.

Heavy rains this spring meant many farms had to postpone planting for up to three weeks, setting back the autumn harvest.

This is a huge issue as a late harvest can be fatal to business because pumpkin sales plummet after Halloween on October 31.

Wholesalers need to get pumpkins on their way to stores by mid-September.

Another spate of rain about two weeks before Irene caused outbreaks of the phytophthora fungus - a type of water mould - in many fields.

This week a cold snap threatened to kill the surviving vines, said Jim Murray, owner of the Applejacks Orchard in Peru, New York.

‘We were real close to a frost (Friday) night,’ he said. ‘It was 34F, and if we had had a frost, a lot of immature pumpkins would have never made it.’

The wholesale price for a bin of 32 to 45 pumpkins ranged from $150 to $200 in upstate New York - about twice the normal price, Mr Pray said.

It was still unclear how the shortage would affect retail prices, he said.

But in a normal year, each pumpkin could sell for up to $15 at a supermarket in a big city like New York.

The problems for Northeast farmers have been great for growers in big pumpkin-producing states such as Illinois, Indiana, California and Ohio.

‘There's been a ton of people calling from New Jersey,’ said Larry Goebel, of Goebel Farms in Indiana. ‘We can sell every pumpkin we want to sell.’

With good pumpkins hard to find, Mr Murray said buyers can make them last longer by washing them with water mixed with a little bleach.

That kills any fungus left over from the fields and staves off mould and rotting.

The pumpkin crunch could also affect tourism because pick-your-own pumpkin farms have become important attractions in many rural areas.

Jim Stakey, owner of Stakey's Pumpkin Farm on Long Island, New York, has a 26-acre farm offering pumpkin-picking.

It also has pony rides, a cornfield maze, rides in a farm wagon and other events. Mr Stakey is buying extra pumpkins to supplement his own crop.

‘Just get your pumpkins early, that's all I can say,’ he advised. ‘It's going to be a difficult season.’
