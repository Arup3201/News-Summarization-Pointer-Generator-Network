They were the players brought in, invariably at great expense, carrying even greater hope of transforming the fortunes of their new club.

A massive £760million was invested over two transfer windows, each addition going on to enjoy varying degrees of success, or otherwise.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through our top 10 signings of the 2013-14 Premier League season… 

Here's what you could have won, Spurs fans. The Brazilian was all set 
for White Hart Lane until Chelsea intervened and took him to west London
 in a £32m deal. The energy and endeavour of the livewire midfielder is 
in stark contrast to those signings who wound up at Spurs. Only 
Christian Eriksen threatened to populate this list, but Willian just 
shades it for the final spot in our top 10.

Eyes on the prize: Willian almost signed for Spurs while Dejan Lovren is the only defender to make our top 10

The Croat is the only defender to make our top 10 but his 
performances on the south coast this season make him a worthy resident. 
An £8.5m arrival from Lyon, he is both classy and composed but with no 
shortage of steel and has been one of the key components in 
Southampton's success this season.

Yes,
 the Spaniard has fallen away in the second half of the season – his 
last league goal came on January 12 – but his impact in the early months
 of the campaign was sensational and he has scored 23 goals since his 
£20m arrival from Sevilla. In the absence of Sergio Aguero he kept 
City's goal return ticking over and his physicality has brought a new 
dimension to City's forward line.

Before his £13m move to Goodison Park, the majority of football fans 
outside of Wigan did not know their McCarthys from their McArthurs. But 
this James has certainly made a name for himself this season. Boasting 
brains as well as bite, the Republic of Ireland midfielder is very 
quickly becoming a terrace favourite with the Toffees and Roberto 
Martinez's decision to bring McCarthy with him to Merseyside has proved 
inspired.

At
 £21m, the Serb's return to Stamford Bridge came at a hefty cost. 
Matic, though, could prove a snip. He has added steel and composure to a
 Chelsea midfield in desperate need of an anchoring presence in recent 
seasons. Matic has done nothing but impress since January and the best 
is arguably still to come.

Without the loanee's goals Newcastle may well have found 
themselves dragged in to a scrap at the bottom of the table. The France 
forward has plundered 14 times and will surely start next season playing
 Champions League football, as is his wish. Remy is certainly deserving 
of the continent's biggest stage on the evidence of this season.

Players prised from the Dutch league have not always enjoyed a smooth 
transition into the English game. Bony, though, has proved a resounding 
success; his 24 goals bear testimony to that. Alert, agile and with a 
killer instinct, the 25-year-old Ivorian is 
deserving of his place in our top five.

Initially a loan signing before making permanent his stay in January, 
the journeyman midfielder has arguably made the difference in Palace's 
survival bid. Indeed, his seven goals in 2014 have all added points to 
the tally which sees the Eagles well clear of danger entering the final game.

Puncheon
 has even been suggested as a wildcard pick for England's World Cup 
squad, such has been his form in the second half of the season.  

Making an impact: Jason Puncheon and Wilfried Bony have starred for Crystal Palace and Swansea in 2013/14

A loan signing, yes, but shrewd nonetheless. The Belgian's goals – 
14 of his 17 coming in the league – took Everton mightily close to
 a Champions League finish.

Still
 just 20 years old, Lukaku has amplified his reputation as one of the 
game's most promising talents and that is before he leads the line for
 Belgium at this summer's World Cup.

On
 the evidence of this season in the blue of Everton, it would be 
staggering were he not given a chance in the blue of Chelsea next term, 
especially when their frontmen have all failed to outscore their 
club-mate.

On target: Romelu Lukaku, on loan from Chelsea, has scored 17 goals this term

The £30m capture of the Brazilian anchorman last summer was not met with too much fanfare. It was an under-the-radar signing and so, we assumed, Fernandinho was an understated type happy to go about his business with minimum fuss.

The 29-year-old, however, has proved so much more, adding craft, graft and even goals to the City engine room. He has been a real class act but, the factor which sees him elevated to the summit of our list, is his consistency. The former Shakhtar man has been a dependable presence at the heart of a side which looks destined to finish the season as champions.
