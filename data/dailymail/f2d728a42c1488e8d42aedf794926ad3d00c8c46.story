Don Collins, 29, (pictured in court during his trial) was jailed on Tuesday for 40 years for setting alight Robert Middleton, eight, in 1998 when he was 13

A convicted child rapist has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for a childhood arson attack on a boy who died as a result nearly 13 years later.

Don Collins, 29, was sentenced on Tuesday for pouring gasoline on Robert Middleton and setting him on fire on Middleton's eighth birthday in 1998 in Splendora, Texas.

Prosecutors said Collins burned Robbie to silence him after he raped him several weeks earlier.

Middleton endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer blamed on his burns. 

The 29-year-old Collins was convicted of capital murder. His punishment was capped at 40 years because he was 13 at the time of the attack.

Don Collins showed no reaction as the verdict was read out, KHOU reported. 

During his trial, he had paid little attention to proceedings and had read the newspaper at times.

At one point, he was overheard discussing his jail term with his lawyer and saying: 'The bright side of this is I'll come out with an education.' 

Prosecution and defense teams presented arguments on Tuesday before the jury started deliberating. 

The jury had heard from witnesses including one man who said Collins raped him and a woman who said the murderer stomped her kitten to death. 

Robbie Middleton's mother, Colleen, told the court: 'Everybody was afraid of him. He was the big bully that stomped kittens to death.'

Another witness said that Collins should never be allowed out of jail because he would harm another child.

Robert Middleton (pictured left and right) suffered burns across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer. He named his  attacker and rapist on video tape shortly before his death as Don Collins

Last week, the jury watched a heartbreaking, deathbed video of Robbie, who suffered 99 per cent burns, where he named the teenager who raped him then tied him up and set him alight in an attempt to cover up his crime.

Robbie succumbed to cancer, believed to have been caused by the horrific burn injuries he suffered 13 years before. A medical examiner ruled his death a homicide.

In 1998, Robbie was tied to a tree and set alight on his 8th birthday in woodland behind his home in Splendora, Texas.   

At trial last Thursday, the jury was shown a 30-minute video of Robbie just 17 days before he died.

According to the Houston Chronicle, on the tape Robbie said: 'Don grabbed me, turned me around and threw gas in my face.'

He said that he was blinded by the gasoline but when he realized he was on fire, he started to run from the woodland trail back home. 

He added: 'I was running as fast as I could but I couldn't see where I was running to', recalling that he was screaming and in horrific pain. 

The 21-year-old Robbie was then asked by the interviewer, attorney Craig Sico, if he was sexually assaulted by Collins.

Robbie replied that two weeks before he was burned, Collins 'took me out into the woods where I was burned. He pulled my clothes down and started raping me'.

The prosecution said Collins set  Robbie on fire to prevent his crime being discovered. 

Collins had pleaded not guilty.  

During the trial, Collins' defense lawyer claimed that Robbie, who spent most of his life at Shriner's Children's Hospital in Galveston, named Collins along with many others soon after the attack. 

Attorney E. Tay Bond said there was not enough evidence to convict Collins and accused the Middleton family's attorney of making up the rape theory.

The defense team added that there were no witnesses to the attack and claimed prosecutors were playing to the jury's emotions. 

'Do not expect the defense to bring an eyewitness to this tragedy because there is not one,' Bond told jurors. There are no witnesses from the woods except for Robbie.'  

Collins was convicted of raping another eight-year-old boy in 2001 at gunpoint. From the age of 16, he spent four years in a juvenile detention center for the crime.

The victim testified at a 2013 hearing to determine whether Collins should be tried as an adult for the crime against Robbie Middleton.

The victim said that Collins threatened to burn him if he told anyone about the assault.

A judge determined last March that Collins could be tried for murder as an adult, despite being a teenager at the time. 

In 1998, Robbie had named Collins as his attacker and the 13-year-old was arrested.

Collins spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to pursue the case.

Robbie's mother Colleen Middleton choked back tears as she testified last week at the Houston court about how Collins had 'stalked' her son in the days before the attack.

She testified that Robbie told her Don Collins, 13, had tied him up and set him on fire.

Mrs Middleton, who found her badly-burned son collapsed by her home, said that in the months after the attack he was so delirious with pain that he named everyone he knew as his attacker - including the family dog. 

However, after almost a year, and when he began to regain lucidity, he named Don Collins as his attacker - and never wavered.
