A man died and his wife is seriously ill after they were apparently poisoned by carbon monoxide fumes from a barbecue while on a camping holiday.

Chris and Jane Bainbridge, who were staying in a £35-per-night wooden pod in the Lake District, were overcome by fumes as they slept.

Camping pods are timber-built huts which provide more comfortable accommodation than a tent.

As they provide better shelter from the elements they are particularly popular in the winter months.

Mr and Mrs Bainbridge are believed to have moved a barbecue inside their pod on Saturday evening, the Daily Mirror reported.

Their neighbours 
back home raised the alarm in Darlington, County Durham, when they 
failed to return from their weekend away.

Dubbed the silent killer, carbon monoxide poisonings claim the lives of 25 people in Britain every year.

As it is colourless and odourless, people with faulty gas appliances often fall unconscious without realising anything is wrong.

Wealthy British businessman Philip Townsend, 55, and his wife MaryAnne, 52, are both believed to have fallen victim to carbon monoxide while on holiday in Estonia last month.

The couple died in a converted barn which it is believed they bought last year.

Millionaire's daughter Zoe Anderson, 24, (pictured) died from carbon monoxide poisoning after a gas fitter 'botched' a boiler installation in Bath, Somerset.

Andrew Hartley, 37, was convicted of manslaughter earlier this month after failing to properly secure the flue pipe to a new boiler in December 2010.

Last year, Tracy Screen, 35, died after being overcome by carbon monoxide fumes while camping.

It is thought the fumes from a barbecue outside her tent in Gyrn Goch, Caernarfon, drifted in.

A search was launched and they were discovered slumped inside the pod at the Quiet Site Caravan Park in Ullswater, Cumbria, on Monday afternoon.

Paramedics were called but Mr Bainbridge, 45, was already dead while Mrs Bainbridge, 43, was unconscious.

Mr Bainbridge was a management information officer at Darlington Borough Council.

Today Mrs Bainbridge remains in hospital where she is in a serious condition.

It
is unclear exactly what happened to Mr and Mrs Bainbridge but  the 
North West Ambulance Service confirmed it was a suspected case of carbon
monoxide poisoning.

A 
spokeswoman for the North West Ambulance Service said: 'We were called 
on Monday at 16.25 to the Quiet Site Caravan Park in Watemillock after 
reports of a male deceased and a female unconscious.

'We took the female to Cumberland Infirmary.'

Neighbour Pam Stott said the couple from Darlington, County Durham, were 'happy and smiling' when she waved them off on Friday.

Mrs Stott said they were regular campers who usually stayed in a tent.

She added: 'You couldn’t ask for better friends and neighbours - we’re so shocked and can’t believe what’s happened.'

Gordon Peacock, a friend of the couple, said: 'We’re not really sure what happened. It seems to be just a tragic accident.'

Mr Bainbridge's colleagues at Darlington Borough Council, where he had worked for 27 years, were yesterday told of the tragedy.

Murray Rose, director of people, told 
staff: 'Chris was holidaying with his wife in the Lake District at the 
time of his death; his wife is also seriously ill in hospital.

'At this time, further details of his death are still to be confirmed.

'Chris
was a terrific colleague who had settled well into his new role within 
the team; he will be missed by friends and colleagues.

'Our thoughts and condolences are being sent to his family at this sad time; we will provide details of any arrangements in relation to his funeral as they become available.'

Mrs Bainbridge previously worked for the authority, although now works elsewhere.

It is understood the couple do not have any children.

A
spokesperson for Cumbria Police said: 'At 4.37pm on Monday 12 March, 
police were called by to The Quiet Site Caravan Park in Watermillock, 
Penrith, to reports of a sudden death.

'Tragically, a man believed to be in his 40s from the North East was found dead at the site.

'A 42-year-old woman was taken to Cumberland Infirmary Carlisle where she remains in a serious condition today.

'The death is not being treated as suspicious at this stage and the case will be passed to the coroner.'
