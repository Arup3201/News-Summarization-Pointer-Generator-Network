Brendan Rodgers has sung the praises of new signings Lazar Markovic and Adam Lallana during the early stages of Liverpool's pre-season preparations.

The Reds boss is delighted with the efforts of his two latest recruits so far in the short space of time he's had to work with them.

The duo are yet to feature for Rodgers' side in pre-season but will get their first taste of action in Liverpool's tour of the USA.

20-year-old Markovic moved to the Merseyside club for £20million from Benfica, with the Serb's attacking verve exciting Rodgers.

'Young Markovic is a really exciting talent,' he told the Daily Express.

'He’s the kind of player I like, who can beat people in one versus one [situations].

'He’s good in the duel but he also works hard so he doesn’t just run forward quickly, he runs back even quicker, which is important.

'That’s the key for us. We’ve got hungry players – players who want to do their best for Liverpool, are technically and tactically gifted but have the personality to work. I’m excited by them all.'

Lallana has added to Liverpool's armory after sealing a £25million transfer from Premier League rivals Southampton.

The England's international flourished whilst at the south coast club and Rodgers expects him to replicate that form at Anfield next season.

'Adam is a wonderful talent. I've seen his progression since he was a young player,' he added.

'In the short time I've worked with him I've realised what a good man he is.

'He's here because he's hungry and wants to fight for Liverpool. He left a great club in Southampton, which he had the great honour of captaining, to come to one of the biggest clubs in the world.'
