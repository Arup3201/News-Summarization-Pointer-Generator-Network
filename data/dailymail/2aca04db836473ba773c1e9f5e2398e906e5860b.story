Arsenal are pressing ahead with an £11m move for Newcastle right-back Mathieu Debuchy.

Manager Arsene Wenger is after a new right-back following the departure of Bacary Sagna to Manchester City.

And Debuchy, currently with France at the World Cup, is emerging as the leading candidate to replace his countryman in the Gunners back-four next season.

Newcastle have been made aware of Arsenal's interest in the full-back and are ready to listen to offers for the Frenchman.

However, a deal is unlikely to be concluded until after France's World Cup participation is over.

Arsenal have also opened talks with Anderlecht over exciting young striker David Henen.
