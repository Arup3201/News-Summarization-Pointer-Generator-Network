Joao Magueijo, 47, has offered a dismal portrayal of English people, calling them 'unrestrained wild beasts who eat food so greasy it needs detergent'

A best-selling book written by a Portuguese academic has offered a dismal portrayal of English people, calling them 'unrestrained wild beasts who eat food so greasy it needs detergent'.

Joao Magueijo, 47, a physics professor at Imperial College London, has seen his book, Bifes Mal Passados (Undercooked Beef) sell more than 20,000 copies in his native country.

Despite spending 25 years of his life on these shores, he describes England as 'one of the most rigid and rotten societies in Europe, possibly the world'. 

He says the English are 'always fighting' and claims 'I never met such a group of animals' - English culture is pathologically violent'. 

Describing a four-hour wait in a Blackpool hospital's A&E department one Sunday afternoon, he says 'it looked like a field hospital after battle'.  

The professor, who spent seven years as a fellow at St John's College, Cambridge, came to England in 1989 to do a master's degree and PhD in theoretical physics.

He has written several books on the subject, with one, Faster Than The Speed Of Light, written in 2003, receiving ridicule after he challenged Einstein's theory of relativity.  

In his latest work, which has been in Portugal's top five best-sellers for the last five months, he writes despairingly about English drinking, eating and sexual habits.

He moans: 'It is not unusual to drink 12 pints, or two huge buckets of beer per person. 

'Even a horse would get drunk with this but in England it is standard practice. In England, real men have to drink like sponges, eat like skeletons and throw up everything at the end of the evening.' 

He labels the diet in the country as 'deplorable', with food 'based on greasy stuff and unspeakable artificial lard'.

In his book, the university professor says it is normal for men in England to drink 12 pints of beer (picture posed by models)

Even national favourite, fish and chips, does not escape his attack. He says that a standard meal will consist of 'a thin layer of the animal covered in many inches of batter, sometimes ten times bigger than the actual fish'.

The fish is so greasy, he writes, that it 'makes you want to wash it with detergent before eating'. 

English women are not spared insult in his book as he goes into detail describing their shameful drinking habits and promiscuity.

Mr Magueijo blasts England's health and hygiene standards, describing Blackpool beach as an ideal place to spot 'human whales' and 'men and women with three-metre waists made of fat and lard'

He claims: 'Oral sex is not considered a sexual act among the English. It is something a woman can perform on a stranger whose name she doesn't even know...No one cares.' 

He recounts a damning anecdote from his Cambridge days where a young woman threw up during a formal dinner then resumed 'eating, drinking and shouting nonsense as if nothing had happened'.

The scientist, who is currently single, blasts England's health and hygiene standards, describing Blackpool beach as an ideal place to see 'human whales'.

He continues: 'They say "it's grim up north"...and now I see why.

'People in the north are incredibly obese, men and women with three-metre waists made of fat and lard.

'When you visit English homes, or the toilets at schools or in student lodgings, they are all so disgusting that even my grandmother's poultry cage is cleaner.' 

The scientist has seen his book, Bifes Mal Passados (Undercooked Beef, pictured above) sell more than 20,000 copies in his native country

He refers to 'a distinguished professor' at Cambridge as 'Dr O' and claims he only washed on Saturdays. 

The authors talks resentfully about the British class system, saying: 'People of different classes don't talk to each other, or if they do they don't understand each other. It's reciprocal fear and hate.'

Speaking to the MailOnline today, he said English people should laugh about the book.

He added: 'And think of those poor sods down in Portugal, enduring a huge economic crisis, and who certainly need a laugh too'.    

The book is dedicated to the Queen and to his Portuguese grandparents. 

Mr Magueijo claims it will not be getting translated into English because 'much would be lost in translation'.

But he insists he does 'not fear British backlash' as he trusts 'the British sense of humour. The book is not a serious book. It is humour, and meant to be taken that way'. 

Despite condemning the English for their 'food, class system and culture' he did have some positive things to say about the country. He said today: 'I love the tolerance, the creativity and the madness of the people.

'There is a certain incapacity for institutional repression, which I like.' 

He added: 'I'd had so many awful experiences attempting to have holidays in the UK that I thought they could serve as a good narrative backbone, Fawlty Towers-style.

'Monty Python is the inspiration.' 

In his book, he does offer some consolation to English readers, saying 'I am thankful to England for the working climate I was offered. But then there is all the rest'.
