For more than 40 years, England fans have wanted the national football team to be more like the Germans.

Now, it seems, they’ve got their wish. For the England team’s latest kit bears a striking resemblance to the strip worn by West Germany in 1966.

The kit, unveiled yesterday, was designed by Nike to mark the 150th anniversary of the Football Association.

Anniversary: The new kit will be worn for the first time against the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday week

The white shirt with round navy 
collar, navy shorts and white socks are based on the strip worn in the 
first international match in 1872, when England played Scotland in 
Glasgow.

But the blue used is so dark that it 
appears almost black, rendering the kit uncannily like that worn by the 
Germans down the decades.

It most resembles the West Germany strip of 
1966, when England – playing in red – won 4-2 in the World Cup Final at 
Wembley.

While England have never again reached such heights, the Germans have since gone on to dominate international football.

Similar style: Criticism for the strip centres around the design looking like previous Germany shirts

It led ex-England striker Gary Lineker
to tweet impishly: ‘Smart move by @FA and @nikefootball to go slightly 
German with the strip. If you can’t beat ’em...’

Other supporters used 
social media to express their anger at the absence of red from the kit.

One wrote: ‘New England shirt looks 
terrible, no effort made and looks like the old German shirt. What 
happened to the red, white and blue?’ Another added: ‘What is with the 
white and navy? Our flag is red and white.’

England will wear the kit for the 
first time against Ireland at Wembley on Wednesday week. Replicas of the
polyester shirt costs £60 for adult sizes.
