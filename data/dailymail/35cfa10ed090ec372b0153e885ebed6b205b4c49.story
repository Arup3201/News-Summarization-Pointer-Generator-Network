Guillermo Rigondeaux survived a scare in Osaka to retain his world titles as Hisashi Amagasa retired on his stool at the end of the 11th round.

The Cuban, who holds the WBO and WBA super-bantamweight belts, was knocked down twice in the seventh round but was in otherwise dominant form.

Amagasa was dropped in the ninth session and his face was battered and bruised by the time he failed to emerge for the final round.

Rigondeaux, who has fought just 15 times as a professional, is among the finest pound-for-pound fighters in the world but his apparently fan-unfriendly style meant this bout was not broadcast in Europe or the United States.

The two-time Olympic champion has fought just twice this year having been dropped by American broadcaster HBO following his defining victory over Nonito Donaire in 2013.

Amagasa came into the fight having lost five of his 34 contests and was a far cry from the calibre of opponent Rigondeaux is desperate to face in the shape of fellow champions Leo Santa Cruz, Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg.

And the 29-year-old struggled to deal with the Cuban’s speed and elusiveness in the opening rounds.

Rigondeaux, who lives in Miami after defecting in 2009, was in complete control at the halfway point before Amagasa threatened to produce an almighty shock.

He dropped the champion with a right to the chin before celebrating as if he had won the fight. Rigondeaux was up quickly however only to return to the canvas seconds later.

That appeared to be from a push rather than a punch but the referee signalled a knockdown, despite the visitor’s protests.

The bell for the end of the round brought a dramatic 30 seconds to a close but normal service was resumed in the next round.

And in the 10th, a straight left dumped Amagasa on the floor. He too was quickly on his feet but the end was nigh.

With his face grotesquely swollen, the challenger battled on until the end of the penultimate stanza before calling it a day.
