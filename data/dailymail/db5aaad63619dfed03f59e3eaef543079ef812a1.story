An Oregon teen accused of planning an assault on his high school wrote detailed plans to 'shoot and throw bombs throughout the school,' then kill himself before engaging with responding police officers, according to court documents released Tuesday.

Police say the plans were written in notebooks that were found hidden beneath the floorboards in the teen's bedroom, along with two pipe bombs, two Molotov cocktails and at least two Drano bombs.

Grant Acord, 17, made his first court appearance by video transmission Tuesday but did not enter a plea on charges that include attempted aggravated murder and six counts each of unlawful possession and manufacture of a destructive device.

Wearing a light-gray sweatshirt and sweatpants with shaggy brown hair covering most of his forehead, Acord said little but replied 'yes, your honor' to questions from Judge Matthew Donohue, who set bail at $2 million.

Acord's writings included 'multiple versions of the plans and diagrams to commit an attack' on West Albany High School, according to a probable cause affidavit signed by Albany Police Detective Mike Wood.

In one, labeled The (Loosely Stated) 'Plan' AKA Worst case Scenario, the teen lays out an itinerary for an attack: Leave home at 7:30, go to first period, then retreat to the parking lot to prepare.

At about 11:10, he would begin blasting music from the car while walking toward the school, a napalm firebomb in one hand and a duffel bag in the other.

'Drop duffel. Light and throw napalm, unzip bag and begin firing,' the notebook said. 'Cooly state: ''the Russian grim reaper is here."

The line is apparently a reference to the 2003 film Bad Boys II.

The plan went on: 'Throw a smoke bomb prior to walking in. Proceed to enter the school, then shoot and throw bombs throughout the school. Kill myself before S.W.A.T. engages me.'

The detective wrote that the notebooks indicate that Acord 'compares himself to both Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,' the teenagers who killed 13 people at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999 before turning their guns on themselves.

Police said they found printouts of a website listing the weapons used by the shooters at Columbine High School and a list of items to use in an attack, including a black trenchcoat, a belt with skull and crossbones buckle, wool socks, various explosive devices and a propane tank.

Several items were listed on a page titled I NEED. They include explosive materials, ammunition, a Hi-Point 995 rifle and a Mossberg 500 pump-action shotgun.

The prosecutor declined to say whether police found firearms in the home.

Also allegedly found in Acord's diary were diagrams to commit the attack and plans to kill himself before SWAT team can take him out

On Monday, Acord's mother, Marianne Fox, issued a statement through a Corvallis lawyer, Alan Lanker, saying the teenager struggles with a rare form of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

'I grieve for my son, but understand and support the efforts of law enforcement to keep our beloved community safe,' the statement said. 'This is a challenging and confusing time for everyone who knows Grant.'

On Monday, the 17-year-old's mother, Marianne Fox, released a statement 
through her attorney attributing her son's alleged acts to his struggle 
with pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder (PANDAS) - a rare 
disorder caused by the body's immune reaction to a streptococcus 
infection.

According to the PANDAS Network, the key trait for the disorder is 
sudden acute and debilitating onset of intense anxiety and mood 
liability accompanied by OCD symptoms or tics.

Target: Police say Acord planned an attack on West Albany High School modeled after the deadly 1999 Columbine school shooting

The organization claims that there is no clear diagnostic criteria for PANDAS, 
which is related to several areas of medicine, and many pediatricians 
are reluctant to diagnose it because they have never seen or heard of 
PANDAS before.

Attorney Alan Lanker, who represents Acord's mother, said that the teen 
received treatment for his condition, but said that he was not 
familiar's with the details of the boy's medical history.

'He's very mentally ill. He has PANDAS. It's a brain infection that's 
causing a mental illness. It's been their concern for some time,' Lanker
said.

Neighbors who live near Marianne Fox and her son told NBC News that 
Acord was a 'quiet young man' and did not stand out in any way.

OregonLive.com reported Tuesday that Beth Maloney, who wrote a book about PANDAS called Saving Sammy, said that Marianne Fox has consulted with her since 2011 about her son's condition.

'She called me desperate for help,' Maloney said.

According to the author, Fox told her that Grant's academic skills had deteriorated since the onset of the illness, and the teen was showing signs of OCD, anxiety and depression.

Maloney said the 17-year-old had been prescribed antibiotics, but his mother wanted to pursue more extensive therapy and was in the process of finding a health insurance that would cover the treatment when he was arrested last week.   

The 17-year-old suspect, who has been held in a juvenile detention 
center since his arrest, is expected to appear in court later today to 
be charged as an adult with attempted murder and other counts.

Also on Tuesday, students at West Albany High School resumed classes 
after a four-day holiday weekend, with extra security officers on hand 
to address any lingering fears regarding the alleged plot.

‘I have been advised that none of the evidence developed thus far 
suggests any broader conspiracy or involvement by any other persons,’ 
school superintendent Maria Delapoer said in a letter to parents, 
according to the Albany Democrat-Herald.

Secret compartment: The student at West Albany High School allegedly hid at least six bombs and bomb-making material in a secret compartment under the floor of his bedroom

Earlier this week, Acord's friends 
have spoken out about how they should have been more suspicious when the
teen started talking to them about the materials that one needs to 
build a bomb.

'He was 
just, just kind of randomly came up to us and started talking about the 
different materials that you need to make a bomb,' Thomas Stone told 
local ABC affiliate KATU.

'You
know, I didn't think much of it 'cause he's kind of a strange kid, so I
wasn't surprised he had some strange hobbies, you know?'

Another
friend said that the relaxed way in which the issue came up didn't tip 
them off to the fact that they should think of it as a sign of a darker 
plan of action. 

'It wasn't like '"Oh, I'm making bombs, I'm gonna blow stuff up,"' classmate Keegan Boggs told KATU.

'It
was just talking about it, like something that you wouldn't really 
think like "Oh, he's gonna blow something up. Like a school."'

He also had 'plans checklists, 
diagrams, inspirations, sources and a focus on recreating the model of 
Columbine, with adjustments that would make it more successful,' 
according to Benton County District Attorney John Haroldson.

The 1999 massacre in Littleton, Colorado,
which was carried out by two Columbine High School seniors, Eric Harris
and Dylan Klebold, left 13 dead and 21 others wounded.

All clear: The Oregon Bomb Squad searched the school twice with K-9 dogs, but no explosives were found inside

'This was a very methodical process,' Haroldson said. 'He took time to even get to this point.'

Police have not yet pinpointed a motive for Acord's plot.

Attorney
Mr Haroldson said he wasn't aware that the teen was having trouble at 
school, or being bullied. He was described as quiet and a loner by other
students, though one student said he seemed like 'a pretty nice guy.'

'In
any case that you have a young person that in essence plans to take a 
video game approach to killing people at school, you have to take a 
close look at the mental health issues,' he said.

'And the process will 
certainly provide for that once he's represented by counsel.'

The teen will be arraigned later today as an
adult on one count of aggravated attempted murder and six counts each 
of manufacturing a destructive device, possession of a destructive 
device and possession of a weapon with intent to use it against another 
person.

According to KPTV - FOX 12, police accompanied by K-9 dogs found no 
bombs during two searches of West Albany High, which is about 75 miles 
south of Portland.

Acord was taken into custody just before
10.30pm Thursday at his mother's home in the 2400 block of Northwest 
Violet Street in West Albany after police discovered six explosives 
hidden under the floorboards.

Officers who searched the premises for evidence also uncovered a detailed plan, checklists, a diagram of Acord's school and a timetable for when he allegedly planned to carry out a mass murder using bombs and gunfire, the Albany Democrat-Herald reported.

'This is beyond a kid playing with a 
couple of cherry bombs. It was serious enough to warrant calling out the
bomb squad,' Albany police Capt. Eric Carter told KATU-TV in Portland.

Students at West Albany High School are shocked after hearing of the foiled bomb plot.

'I'm just shocked because you hear about it at other schools and other places around the world, but you never really think it's going to happen,' high school junior Keagan Boggs told KPTV.com.

Senior Dennis Reilly said: 'I'd say "hi" to him in the hallway because I was kind of like I should probably talk to this kid, make sure he feels OK. So, I talked to him sometimes, and he seems like a pretty nice guy.'
