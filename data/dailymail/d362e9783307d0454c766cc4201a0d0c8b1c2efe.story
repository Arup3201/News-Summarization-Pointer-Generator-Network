The days when a pair of 
beige granny pants was the only option for girls needing a bit of secret support on a night out are long gone.

Shapewear
has taken on a whole new identity - and proof of just how alluring it 
is to women - and men - comes from Debenhams, who report that sales of comfortable 'shapewear' pants made famous by stars such as Tulisa have surged for Valentine's Day.

Smitten males are heading to the high street giant to snap up Valentine's Day lingerie for their partners and Bridget Jones would be proud to know that sales of support lingerie are up 120 per cent on last year.

According to the retailer, the new range is more 'Bridget Bardot than Bridget Jones', with beige panelled pants replaced by pretty patterns and lace.

The most popular design is the black body shaper, which has seen an 86 per cent increase in sales, followed by the 'silky suck me in' slips, up 72 per cent, and the pretty but practical pants, up 70 per cent on last year.

Sharon Webb, head of lingerie buying and design at Debenhams, said women should not see this new trend as a 'slap in the face'.

She said: 'Debenhams has turned the concept of controlwear on its head by creating lingerie that not only makes women feel fantastic but also looks great.

Long gone: Bridget Jones would be proud to know that the shapewear she made famous is a hit, but it has had a slightly more sexy update

'In fact, gone are the days that shapewear is regarded as a faux pas and it's no longer a negative thing for a man to buy it for a woman. It's all about sexy shapewear now.

'Previously, men have admitted they were worried they would offend their partner by buying them products such as shapewear and anti-ageing cream, but this year they just want to get it right.'

Famous fans: Princess Beatrice and Kourtney Kardashian are both fans of shapewear

Extra support: Kim Kardashian is often snapped donning control pants under her tight-fitting dresses

Women used to save shapewear for work and 'non sexy days' but nowadays control underwear is a must have of the modern wardrobe, Ms Webb said.

According to a survey by the retailer more than four in five women (82 per cent) have worn control garments, with celebrities including Beyonce, Tulisa and Kourtney Kardashian all admitting they aren't afraid to don a pair.

Shapewear prices start from £10 and are available in Debenhams' stores and online.
