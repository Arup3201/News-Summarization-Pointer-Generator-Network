A burglar who vowed to go straight after forming a bond with one of his victims under a flagship government scheme has sentenced to five years in prison after a new crime spree.

Margaret Foxley, 54, had agreed to meet career criminal Ian Ashworth in prison, despite the fact that he had stolen a laptop containing photographs of her daughter Jessica, who subsequently died in a car crash.

Ashworth, 44, and Mrs Foxley had taken part in the Government’s flagship Restorative Justice scheme, and even appeared together on BBC’s The One Show to discuss the initiative,  in which victims come face to face with offenders in the hope of shocking them into staying out of trouble.

However, just eight months after chatting to hosts Alex Jones and Matt Baker about ending his life of crime, Ashworth crept into a private area of his local church and helped himself to the £100 from in the charity boxes.

He was caught and bailed, only to then go on another burglary spree striking eight times, including twice in one day at homes and another church stealing cash and valuables.

Police rearrested him again after he was placed on a wanted list. His arrest follows reports the restorative justice scheme has been a success across the UK.

Despite his return to crime Mrs Foxley, a Conservative town councillor, has promised to meet Ashworth again in jail after he pleaded guilty to two burglaries and asked for eight other break ins to be considered.

'I would like to speak to him to understand what went wrong and also believe it would be beneficial for him to meet the more recent victims of his crimes,' she said in a statement.Ashworth from Great Harwood, Lancashire, who has clocked up more than 90 offences met Mrs Foxley in 2009 after he was locked away for year and nine months following a series of raids including a burglary at her home.

During the break in, Ashworth grabbed a camera and jewellery as well as a laptop containing photographs of her singer daughter Jessica, 21, who was subsequently killed in a car crash with two friends in Colne.

He also stole Jessica’s silver necklace set which her parents had made for her 18th birthday.

Mrs Foxley had initally refused to meet Ashworth because she was so appalled at his crimes yet was persuaded to see him after being moved by the forgiving nature of Jessica in the weeks before her death.

The meeting took place in the chapel at his prison just ten days after Jessica’s funeral in October 2009.

Ashworth and Mrs Foxley shook hands and he admitted he had sold the laptop for just £35 on the black market to buy drugs.

During the meeting he wept and said: ‘I’m really sorry for what I’ve done.'

Later
he explained: 'I wanted to change but I didn’t know how. When I met 
Margaret at first I wanted to get it over with and get out of there. 
When she told me about her daughter, it really hit me.

'I
realised I’d been selfish and hadn’t given a damn about -anybody. What 
right did I have to do what I’d done to her? It gave me strength to go 
straight and I believe Margaret saved my life.'

After
his release on parole from jail last year, Ashworth went on the One 
Show in January and promised to go into schools to talk to students 
about his experiences in the hope of warning them off crime.

However, Burnley Crown Court was told on August 4 that the priest at Wulstan’s Roman Church in Great Harwood found charity boxes missing.

Ashworth was identified by police from CCTV footage and was questioned and charged before being bailed.

Despite being on bail, on August 29, Ashworth break into a house and stole an iPhone while the occupant was home.

He was again recognised from CCTV and while police tried to trace him he carried out seven more raids.

Stephen Parker, prosecuting, said that in one of the break ins on September 16, a mother and daughter returned to their home, to find Ashworth in their hall.

The daughter chased him through the house and into the back yard. The victims discovered a glass panel had been smashed and rooms searched and a handbag containing £200 cash and four gold rings worth £800 were stolen.

Keith Harrison, mitigating, said 
Ashworth had 'resolved' not to commit any crime on his release, but 
unfortunately his heroin addiction 'got the better of him'.

He added: 'He committed the offences in a flurry of uncontrolled behaviour. The crimes were unsophisticated and opportunist, but grossly upsetting for those whose houses were burgled.''He’s let himself down and the court down. He did manage to stay clean for quite a while.'

Passing sentence, judge Mr Recorder Philip Parry slammed the charity boxes theft.

He told Ashworth: 'It’s bad enough that somebody would go into a church and steal charitable collections, but this was that in a private area of the church.

'You explained to police that you felt really bad about what you did that day, were remorseful and didn’t want it to happen again.

'The court is sympathetic to people who have done their best to rid themselves of the vice-like grip of heroin addiction, but you committed many more offences.

'Your expressions of remorse and sympathy can only take you so far today. The public in this area are entitled to be protected from people like you, addiction or no addiction.'
