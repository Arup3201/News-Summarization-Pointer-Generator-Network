So what about financial fair play? It wasn’t mentioned as part of the great leap forward and the Football League does have very strict views on this. There are percentages of turnover that can be paid as salary - 55 per cent in League Two, 60 per cent in League One - and huge  punishments for clubs that fail to comply.

And into this forest of red tape and limitation, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke wishes to introduce clubs that cannot be bound by those rules for, if they were, they would undoubtedly fail.

The Premier League B teams would include players earning far in excess of the norm for the competition and have financial structures that bear no relation to those of the standard lower league club.

Vision for the future: FA Chairman Greg Dyke speaks after revealing the commission's findings

To B, or not to B? An animated Dyke outlines his vision for the future of English football

For the 
bottom line is that Manchester United B do not really exist. Not as a 
real club with a board and an independent revenue stream, and sponsors 
and advertisers, supporters and a gate and salaries that conform to the
 limitations of League Two.

So
 to expect Accrington Stanley to be tied to Football League regulations 
on expenditure, while playing against a striker earning £25,000 a week 
whose owners are not party to the same rules, is entirely unfair.

In
 2013, the average wage in League Two was £49,600, annually. An emerging
 Premier League player at a major club could expect to earn that in 
between two weeks and a month at the worst. So how will the Football 
League calculate what is financially fair for the interlopers, 
particularly as B teams are  notoriously under-supported?

Some optimistic souls think the bright young things of Tottenham B would give a revenue boost to the lower divisions but the opposite is true. These teams have no away support, for instance, so that vital revenue stream for Football League clubs might be reduced to a dribble.

In Spain, where the B team idea is long established, Real Madrid Castilla — about to be relegated, by the way — are the 19th worst supported team in the second division, with Barcelona B 16th. Real Madrid are averaging crowds of 72,943 in this campaign; Real Madrid Castilla are averaging 3,049. Last season, a single Real Madrid home game amounted to close to 15,000 more than watched Castilla all year.

It is the same with Barcelona B. In 2012-13, their average attendance was 5,117 — but one game against Villarreal, who clinched promotion that day, was besieged by 10,000 away fans and drew 13,826, amounting to close to 13 per cent of the season total. Barcelona B had the lowest gate of the season, 977 against Las Palmas; Castilla hold that record this year, 1,136 against Girona. One imagines, once any novelty wears off, England’s B teams may even draw less.

You can’t pay players £20,000 a week on gates of, let’s be generous, 2,500. If Morecambe wanted to do it they would be hit with punitive fines. So there is no way of levelling this playing field, unless the Football League insists these B teams are set up as separate entities with their own, quantifiable, financial structure that can be measured against their rivals. And that can’t happen because the salaries are those of aspiring Premier League footballers.

On the slide: Real Madrid Castilla are on the verge of being relegated

Low crowds: The Real Madrid B Team are the 19th worst supported side in the second division

That’s the technical, practical point. Here’s one from the heart. Liverpool fans sing that Chelsea have no history, and that’s rubbish — but Chelsea B certainly haven’t. And neither have Liverpool B, Stoke City B, Manchester City B or any other Bs you care to name.

Meanwhile, in the lower leagues, away from the daily narrative spilled across our back pages and television screens, there are rivalries that go back decades, maybe even centuries, fixtures that are anticipated all year, while barely registering in the wider world.

Pride of Lancashire: Blackpool and Preston have a rivalry that no B team can match

Fierce rivalry: If Premier League B teams are integrated into the lower leagues it could devalue the rivalries of teams like Mansfield and Chesterfield

Grimsby Town and Lincoln City, the only teams in Lincolnshire; Colchester United and Southend United, the two from Essex; the Sheffield derby; the Bristol derby; Blackpool versus Preston North End; Luton Town versus Watford; any meeting involving Plymouth Argyle, Torquay United and Exeter City.

One of the bitterest derbies in English football is Chesterfield versus Mansfield Town. Their grounds are 10 miles apart and there has always been rivalry, but in 1984 the Derbyshire miners went on strike while the Nottinghamshire miners remained at work. It hasn’t been pretty since.

So introducing a raft of B teams into these leagues dilutes those passions and that intensity. Not discounting that every team in those lower leagues bears the name of its community. Who carries the banner for Fleetwood besides the local football club, particularly once it is kicked further down the league by this invasion of Premier League wannabes? There is an identity in following Hartlepool or Bury that Arsenal B will never possess. They deserve their voice, their place and their status.

New league: Young stars like Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek could play in the FA's new proposed league

Back to the technical. What happens when the top of League One becomes a giant bottleneck through which B teams cannot pass? Dyke says League One will be the limit of aspiration for B clubs, but they will be able to occupy promotion places, even if they cannot take the promotion. What happens if the top eight teams in League One cannot go up, and promotion and play-offs involve those ranked ninth to 14th? Those clubs will not be equipped for the Championship. They will not have sufficient form or financial strength based on revenue to cope.

Crowds are drawn to winning football and the ninth placed team in League One this season, Port Vale, lost 21 matches. Could we seriously consider promotion for a team who had been beaten that many times?

Promotion is about momentum. What keeps a team afloat in a higher division is often the positive energy that has been built over the previous winning campaign. Yet what momentum will a mid-table club  rising by default have; how will they cope without that thrust? Reserve teams used to play in the Football Combination and the Central League but as the modern game evolved, so major Premier League clubs became dissatisfied with that model.

They didn’t like the idea of their precious young talent being kicked around an empty stadium by much older professionals, inferior, on the wane and cynical, or desperate to impress the manager that they were ready for first-team action on Saturday.

This, if anything, is worse. Playing against some hatchet-faced old pro from the lower leagues, whose  methods might be at best agricultural, is hardly the best preparation for a career among the elite.

Loan issues: The current loan system allows bigger clubs to stockpile players and loan them out - as Chelsea do with Thibaut Courtois

Unless it addresses the loan system Dyke’s plan is bunk anyway. Thibaut Courtois is likely to return to  Chelsea this summer and replace Petr Cech in the first team. Would he have been able to do that had he spent three years playing the likes of Wycombe Wanderers? No. So why would Chelsea use their B team when they could still loan a player to Liverpool, Everton, Atletico Madrid or Vitesse Arnhem, as happened this season?

Tomas Kalas came straight into the first team and performed excellently against Liverpool because he had honed his talent against clubs like Ajax and PSV Eindhoven in the Dutch league. It isn’t the same against Northampton Town.

Starlet: Dyke has the support of Manchester United, with young talent like James Wilson

Without the loan system, the elite could no longer stockpile and their best young players would make careers at smaller clubs, many in the Premier League, as used to happen. Now if the B teams become reality, the powerful can keep close to 30 or 40 players on elastic in the top divisions and below, and nothing in Dyke’s paper truly addresses that. Outlawing loans, however, would have meant taking on the rich and powerful and the FA are not so bold.

So what might be a way forward? No loan system and a clearly defined Under 23 league for top level club academy players, outside the pyramid, with a trophy, a financial incentive, and a proper television contract.

A star is born: Johnny Haynes became an overnight sensation when he played for England Schoolboys against Scotland in front of 55,000 at Wembley

What if two slots each weekend were set aside for live Under 23 league matches - 10.45 to 12.30 on Saturday and 12 until 2 on Sunday - serving as a taster for the Premier League action later? People would watch their team; they might tune in to see a top-of-the-table clash, too, or an individual with a growing reputation.

In the early days of television, before saturation coverage made every game available, Johnny  Haynes became a name overnight for his performance in a match between England and Scotland schoolboys. There is an appetite for a proper youth competition and the success of the NextGen Series proved it. UEFA weren’t getting a slice of that pie, however, so they started their own tournament based entirely around the Champions League clubs and killed it. 

Yes, there are good ideas in Dyke’s blueprint - a tougher stance on work permit regulation is long  overdue, even if Willian was among the 30 per cent of players who required special dispensation this season. Some will at least credit Dyke with starting a debate. Yet the B team league is his big idea and it is hopelessly, catastrophically, flawed.

If a debate begins with a fanfare and ends five minutes later with a raspberry, it really isn’t much of a conversation at all.
