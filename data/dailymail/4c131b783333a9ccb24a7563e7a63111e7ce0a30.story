A CPS clerk gagged an elderly widow and beat her to death on the morning she was due to go on a luxury cruise - before trying to kill himself, a court heard today.

Old Bailey case worker Thomas Blazquez, 51, who knew 77-year-old Rosemary Shearman through his mother's bridge club, killed the pensioner as she waited for a taxi to take her to Dover.

Mrs Shearman, from Platford Green, Hornchurch, east London was due to go on a ten-day voyage around the Norwegian fjords.

Blazquez, of Onslow Gardens, South Woodford, east London, who has worked on hundreds of infamous murder cases, met Mrs Shearman through his mother’s bridge club.

It is alleged he angrily attacked the pensioner after she had just returned home from the hairdressers.

Prosecutor Mark Dennis QC said there was no clear motive for why the alleged murder took place.

He said: ‘Having confronted Rosemary Shearman in her living room, frustration turned to anger and then to violence, with matters getting wholly out of hand.'

Southwark Crown Court heard he bound the victim and forced a handkerchief into her mouth before he murdered her.

Mrs Shearman was due to go on a cruise the morning she was killed. It is alleged she was beaten to death and tied up by Blazquez, who then allegedly tried to kill himself. The defendant denies murder

After the killing, Blazquez tried to commit suicide, jurors heard.

Mr Dennis said: 'It is apparent that, having realised the enormity of what he had done, the defendant had finally resolved to end his own life, no doubt fearing the awful revelation of his dreadful acts of violence that morning.'

Mrs Shearman’s body was found by neighbours on the first floor landing of her £500,000 detached home on September 3 last year.

The court heard she had been beaten to her head and body, bound with tape and rope.

Mr Dennis said: ‘The neighbours immediately assumed that she had been confronted by a burglar who had attacked her before fleeing the scene.'

‘However, while awaiting the arrival of the emergency services, they realised to their shock that her assailant was still in the house, apparently hiding in a first floor bathroom.

‘When the police arrived and forced open the bathroom door, they found the defendant, knife in hand, having cut himself to his neck and wrist in an apparent bid to commit suicide’.

Blazquez worked for CPS London as a caseworker between January 1988 and November 2012.

He was a familiar face at the Old Bailey, Snaresbrook Crown Court and Stratford Magistrates' Court.

Mrs Shearman had lived in the house since 1979 and was a popular figure in the community.

Her husband, Albert, a company director, passed away six years ago.

Blazquez admits manslaughter but denies her murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

The trial continues.
