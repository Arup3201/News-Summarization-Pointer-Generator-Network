Bath time is a thorny subject in many households but when it is a hedgehog that needs a wash it can be even more difficult.

This prickly customer is fast becoming an internet sensation after a video appeared online of him taking a bath.

At first the little hedgehog - named Ragweed - does not appear too keen on having a wash but once in the sink he proves amazingly buoyant.

So far the adorable video of Ragweed has been watched more than 120,000 times on Youtube.

Initially the hedgehog stays fairly calm as he rests in his owner's hands above the sink.

But as he starts to be lowered in Ragweed begins to panic and attempts to wriggle free.

He only relaxes again when he curls himself into a protective ball.

However, once he is placed in the water Ragweed happily floats in the sink and does not appear concerned at being spun around.

His owner, who goes by the name Evan 
Countryman online, said it was the first time he had managed to get his 
pet to float on his back.

He wrote: 'We figured that once he curls 
into his ball form he usually stays like that until we put him down so 
we thought, "Lets submerge him slowly into the sink".'

Hedgehogs, particularly the African pygmy variety have been popular pets in the United States for a number of years.

In 2008, the craze hit the UK where animals were being sold for up to £190 each.

Hedgehog pet guides say the animals should be bathed once every one to two weeks in shallow tepid water.

They can swim for short periods of times but wild hedgehogs often drown in garden ponds if they drop in and are unable to climb out.
