There must have been times in the five months since Liverpool paid AC Milan £16million to bring Mario Balotelli back to English football that Brendan Rodgers has seriously questioned his sanity never mind his judgement.

Such has been the negligible impact made by the volatile Italian since August that it was a surprise to even see him on the bench on Monday night. Balotelli’s three-game absence had coincided with an upturn in fortunes at Anfield that has lifted some of the pressure on the manager.

It continued with a rampant Liverpool performance against Swansea that was rewarded with a fine win for Rodgers’s side, their biggest of the season. Liverpool scored four and could have had more. Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana were excellent.

But it has not always been this way during a difficult season for Rodgers, of course. And, even in victory, the Northern Irishman could have been forgiven for watching Wilfried Bony and thinking of what might have been.

In the last Premier League match of 2014, the Ivory Coast hit-man was guaranteed to finish the calendar year as the leading scorer in the top-flight.

When Liverpool were weighing up their options to replace Luis Suarez last summer, Bony was very close to the top of their list.

Not only did Swansea’s £12m record signing score 24 goals in his first season in England, it did not escape Rodgers and his staff that he held the ball up so well in both games against their team that it was almost impossible to get it off him.

It was no surprise that Liverpool were prepared to activate the £20m buyout clause in Bony’s contract last summer but his £100,000-a-week wage demands proved to be too much of an obstacle.

Having declined an opportunity to sign the Ivorian when he was given a two-week trial at Melwood in 2007 by Rafael Benitez, Liverpool once again decided to look elsewhere.

What subsequently made little sense, however, was that they agreed to similar terms to sign Balotelli – a problem player who had left Manchester City 18 months earlier more famous for the fireworks in his own bathroom than anything he was producing on the pitch.

The results since have been largely predictable.

Bony had scored eight goals in his last 12 games going into Monday night’s encounter. Balotelli had yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League, his two goals for the club coming against Ludogorets in the Champions League and a dramatic Capital One Cup comeback against Swansea here back in October.

No wonder he was sat on the bench last night alongside Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini, making an ineffective appearance late on. It is a continuing indictment of Liverpool’s strikeforce in the absence of Daniel Sturridge, that Rodgers leaves them all out and ask Sterling to lead the line so effectively.

If Liverpool can finally offload Borini for as little as £6m next month, they may opt to bring in a loan signing and then wait for the summer to make a permanent acquisition. It would be no surprise at all if Bony once again appeared on their radar, regardless of the fact he signed a one-year contract extension at Swansea last month.

There are few better strikers at holding up play and bringing teammates into the game. Bony will be sorely missed when he goes away next week on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Monday night, for instance, was not an easy one for him. There was little service and few chances – save for a snatched 30-yard shot well over the bar – as Liverpool bossed the first half, leaving Bony an isolated figure. Even then, he was a constant presence, often requiring two markers.

But when Swansea rallied after half-time, Bony suddenly burst into life.

One powerful header brought a fine save from Simon Mignolet and when Wayne Routledge crossed towards him in the 52nd minute, there was instant panic in the Liverpool defence.

Mamadou Sakho won the header but didn’t really care where he was putting it, and only succeeded in teeing up a goal for Gylfi Sigurdsson.

Almost straight from the restart Bony forced Mignolet into another smart save from 20 yards that almost produced an equaliser for Routledge.

Liverpool pulled away again to clinch a well deserved victory, helped in no small measure by a fatal misjudgement from Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski.

Bony went off just after the hour mark, saved for another day. But even on a quiet night, he had made his impact felt. He might be back at Anfield sooner than he thinks.
