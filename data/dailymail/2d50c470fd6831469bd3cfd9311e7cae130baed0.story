A man has been jailed for more than a year after assaulting  a Police Community Support Officer by throwing a sandwich at him.

Thomas South, 20, hurled the packaged sandwich at PCSO James Wilkinson, leaving him with a cut lip.

Projectile: South had bought a packaged cheese bap (file photo)

Sentence: South was jailed for more than a year at Nottingham Crown Court

Scott had been trying to escape the officer after trying to use a fake £20 note in a shop. Suspicious staff who spotted the scam called police.

He had earlier bought the cheese bap with another fake note from a Costa Coffee in Nottingham.

Jailing him at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Andrew Hamilton told him: ‘There was no need for that whatsoever, and you are going to end up in custody.’
