Russell Brand has leapt to Justin Bieber's defence following the emergence of a video that features him singing vile racial slurs at the age of 14.

The footage, released by TMZ, features the Never Say Never hitmaker making a joke about killing a 'n*****' and joining the Ku Klux Klan, but insists the 20-year-old singer should not be criticised because the comments came when he was younger.

In a video posted on his daily YouTube show The Trews, the comedian explains: 'It was ages ago when he used to have that haircut. You can’t do him for stuff he [has] done when he had that haircut.'

The Get Him To The Greek star also admits it is wrong to use the 'N-word' and insists the star shouldn't be 'destroyed' because his celebrity status has increased.

He added: 'Unless we’re going to explicitly say the role of celebrities is we're going to make them really, really famous and then we’re going to destroy them and rip them up in a public square with fish hooks, which, you know as long as you don't get round to me, I’m not against.

'But we might as well own up to it if that is what we’re up to, otherwise just let him off. Of course it’s wrong to say the "N-word", but he’s a child.'

Of course, the British comedian is no stranger to controversy in his own life.

Most
 notably, in October 2008, Brand and fellow Radio 2 DJ Jonathan Ross 
came under fire for making a series of obscene phone calls to actor 
Andrew Sachs, in which they crudely discussed the former Fawlty Towers 
star's granddaughter Georgina, who brand alleged to have slept with.

Both Brand and Ross were suspended by the BBC for the incident, with the comedian later resigning from the show in the wake of the scandal.

Russell's latest comments come after Justin apologised a second time for video footage showing him making racist remarks.

He was forced to make his latest apology after a second video emerged showing Bieber singing his hit song One Less Lonely Girl, but changing the final words to ‘lonely n*****’.

The singer, who fans branded ‘an arrogant little twerp’ over the footage, also uses sick lyrics about killing black people and joining the Ku Klux Klan.

The 24-second clip follows the release of a video a few days ago in which he asked: ‘Why are black people afraid of chainsaws?’ before imitating the noise of a chainsaw and saying: ‘Run n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****, n*****’.

The footage will further jeopardise his career, which has already suffered from a string of run-ins with police in America and his native Canada.

Now he has apologised - once again - for the latest controversial footage.

He told The Sun: 'Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with.

'But I feel now that I need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger.

'At the end of the day, I just need to step up and own what I did.'

He said in a statement: ‘I’m very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all  cultures very seriously and apologise for offending or hurting anyone with my  childish and inexcusable mistake.

‘I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again.’

Racists: The popstar was reportedly caught on camera changing the lyrics of his song One Less Lonely Girl to sing 'one less lonely n*****' - and joked about joining white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan (file picture)

Bieber, 20, who has sold more than 15million albums and earned a reported £80million, blamed the first video, filmed when he was 15, on youthful indiscretion.

In the latest footage Bieber wears a blue shirt and a dog tag necklace. A female friend can be 
heard laughing in the background, and the singer smiles as he gives his 
twisted rendition of Lonely Girl, the original version of which has been
 viewed 203million times on YouTube.

Last night show business
 website TMZ reported that the new video was captured when Bieber was 
14, after he had seen a comedian’s parody of Lonely Girl.

The website also claimed
 Bieber had  realised at the time that making the recording was a 
mistake, and had told his mentor, the R’n’B star Usher Raymond, and 
actor Will Smith. Mr Raymond rebuked him and showed him videos to 
illustrate the evils of racial prejudice, it reported.

What's more, TMZ reports that the Young Money Entertainment clan, which features the likes of 'Lil Wayne and Birdman – who Justin regularly hangs out with – are supporting the Never Say Never hitmaker.

Mack Maine, President of Young Money, is quoted by the website as saying: 'Bieber does not have a slave mentality.  He treats his people with respect.'

Turning to God: As well as his apology, Bieber posted this Bible passage on Wednesday, from the book of John and from Isaiah, both passages relate to forgiveness

The white supremacist Ku Klux Klan lynched hundreds of black people in the southern US.

TMZ last night claimed 
Bieber had been approached two months ago by a man who wanted £650,000 
for the first video, of the racist joke, but his PR team refused.

The man then supposedly 
asked for half that sum but Bieber’s  people refused again, saying they 
did not think it would do much damage since he was so young.
