John Eyre, his sons Jack and Rhys, and their friend Ross Hunter were at Piccadilly station in Manchester on March 2, 2013, when they encountered the stags.

The groups were travelling in opposite directions on travelators linked to platforms 13 and 14 when they began goading each other.

Mr Recorder Williams, sentencing, said: 'This was disgraceful - you consumed such a quantity of alcohol that your judgement went out of the window.' 

Explaining why he wasn't locking them up, he added: 'I take the view that it's more important that you keep your jobs and make some kind of repayment for this, and I'm persuaded you will not get into trouble again.'
