President Obama is going Hollywood.

It has just been announced that a new film, Southside With You, will tell the story of the very first date Barack and Michelle Obama took back in 1989.

And while the role of Michelle has been cast in the independent feature, it is still not certain who will be playing a young Barack.

So in love: President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama's first date will be the subject of a new movie

Romance: Southside With You will tell the story of their day-long first date, which ended with ice cream and a kiss at Baskin-Robbins (above)

Family: Shortly after getting married, Michelle gave birth to daughter Malia (right) and then Sasha (left)

Tika Sumpter, best known for her roles on the television shows Gossip Girl and The Haves and the Have Nots, as well as films such as Get On Up, has landed the role of Michelle. 

Richard Tanne wrote the script and will direct the picture.

Set to shoot next July in Chicago, the film will detail the day-long first date shared by Barack and Michelle, which both have spoken of fondly in past interviews.

At the time, Barack, 27, had just finished his first year at Harvard and was a summer associate at the law firm Sidley Austin, where he met Michelle Robinson, the 25-year-old lawyer who was selected as his mentor. 

Star Turn: Tika Sumpter (above)  and will play Michelle

Culture: Their first stop on the date was the Art Institute of Chicago (above)

Wedding bells: The two were married three years after that first date in 1992

After pursuing his future wife for some time, Barack packed in as many activities as he could on the couple's first date, taking Michelle to the Art Institute of Chicago, lunch in the museum's courtyard, a walk around the city, and, finally, to see Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing.

The two ended the night with a kiss outside a Baskin-Robbins.  

Three years later they were married, and now, after 25 years together, they are parents to two teenage daughters, Malia and Sasha.

According to Deadline, the film will be in the vein of Before Sunrise, Richard Linklater's 1995 minimalist masterpiece that tells the story of a young American abroad in Europe (played by Ethan Hawke), who has a chance encounter with a young French woman (played by Julie Delpy), and then spends the day wandering the streets of Vienna with her as they discuss their thoughts on love, life and loss.  

And while no release date has been announced as of yet, it seems highly likely that should all go to plan, a Valentine's Day 2016 release is in the works.
