A woman accused in the deaths of four children in a fire at her home day care in Houston was found guilty today on one count of felony murder.

Jessica Tata, 24, who was emotionless when the verdict was read out, faces up to life in prison for the February 2011 death of 16-month-old Elias Castillo.

Authorities say Tata left Elias and six other children unsupervised while she went to a nearby Target store.

The fire started when oil ignited in a pan on top of a stovetop burner. Three other children were seriously injured in the fire.

Tata still faces three more counts of 
felony murder, three counts of abandoning a child and two counts of 
reckless injury to a child.

The jury are still to hear evidence in the punishment phase of her trial. Prosecutors did not say after the verdict was read whether they planned to seek a life sentence.

Some of Elias' family and relatives of other victims present in the courtroom slumped over and began to cry.

'We're thankful for today's verdict,' said Nancy Villanueva, one of Elias's aunts. 'We're happy.'

Defense attorney Mike DeGeurin said he accepted the jury's verdict and would now focus on sentencing.

'She's never lost sight of the real victims,' DeGeurin said. 'She hasn't forgotten that. It's not all about her.'

Tata's attorneys argued that she never intended to hurt the children, who ranged in age from 16 months to three years, and that she tried to save them.

But prosecutors did not need to show she intended to harm the children, only that the deaths occurred because she put them in danger by leaving them alone.

Under Texas law, a person can be convicted of felony murder if he or she committed an underlying felony and that action led to the death.

Tata fled to Nigeria in the wake of the fire but was captured a month later and returned to the U.S. where she has remained jailed since. She was born in the U.S. but has Nigerian citizenship.

During Tata's trial, which began October 24, surveillance video was presented that showed her shopping at Target just before the fire occurred. A former Target manager told jurors that Tata did not seem to be in a hurry after realizing she had left the stove on while the kids were at the day care.

Neighbors testified that they heard the children crying during their unsuccessful attempts to rescue them from the blaze. Parents told jurors they had trusted Tata, believing she was qualified.

Defense attorneys presented expert testimony to argue that faulty kitchen equipment may have sparked the fire.

Jurors
could also have found Tata guilty of four lesser counts. There was 
brief confusion in court on Tuesday when the jury indicated it had 
reached a verdict.

But State District Judge Marc Brown sent them back because they had chosen multiple counts instead of one.

Prosecutors played back surveillance 
video that they say shows Tata shopping alone at the Walmart on the morning 
of the fatal blaze in February 2011. She also stopped at a Starbucks.

They
also allege that she also went shopping earlier that morning, leaving 
behind the children who ranged in age from 16 months to three years old.

The video later shows her van leaving the store's parking lot, though it isn't clear if the children are in the vehicle.

Tata's attorneys also showed a video, one she took the day of the fire that shows her loading the children into the van.

However, defense attorney Mike DeGeurin did not say what time the video was taken or if it was before Tata had gone to Walmart.

In the video, Tata could be heard telling the children, 'OK guys, get up. It's time to go.' Three-year-old Shomari Dickerson, who died in the fire, could be seen running outside of the home to the van.

Tata's attorneys argue that she never intended to hurt the children and that she tried to save them from the fire, which injured three other children.

Brian Smith, who worked at the Walmart, testified that the surveillance video and a receipt he reviewed showed Tata was at the store around 7:50am on the day of the fire.

In the video, Tata can be seen walking down an aisle alone.

Prior testimony indicated that most of the children in Tata's care that day had been dropped off by 7:15am.

'Does she appear to be in a hurry?' prosecutor Steve Baldassano asked, referring to the video.

'No,' Smith responded.

Smith later acknowledged that he couldn't tell if any children were in the van as it left the Walmart parking lot.

Prosecutors also played surveillance video showing Tata shopping at Target just before the fire, which investigators say was sparked by oil in a frying pan on a stovetop burner.

Tata can be seen arriving at the store at 1:06pm, paying for her items and then lingering in a Starbucks in the store before leaving at 1:22pm.
