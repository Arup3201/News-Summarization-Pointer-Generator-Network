The young woman who has become the terrified face of the Sydney cafe siege is a 20-year-old university student who had recently returned from a holiday in the U.S.

Jieun Bae arrived for work at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place at around 9am, just 45 minutes before Man Haron Monis walked in, produced a shotgun and took 17 people hostage.

She finally escaped at 5pm, when footage of her running for her life and into the arms of a heavily armed policeman became the defining moment of the siege.

Ms Bae, who is of Korean heritage and from Sydney's north-west, was described as a 'sweet girl' by friends. She is an active member of a presbyterian church.

The student has spent the day with police and is understood to have received counselling. She was physically unhurt and her family was waiting to be reunited with her.

Ms Bae had told her family that she did not want to talk publicly about her harrowing experience, according to friends. 

Yesterday Ms Bae's friends, who knew she worked at the cafe, became desperately worried when they could not get in touch with her after news broke that people were being held hostage. 

On Monday afternoon, her mother made a heartrending plea for the safe release of her daughter and urged people to pray for her.

A family friend, who wished to remain anonymous,  told Daily Mail Australia that they had spoken with the woman and she had been calm but very worried. 

'At this stage she is calm and just hoping for her release,' the friend said. 'She believes that her daughter is being held hostage and is asking everyone to pray for her.'

The family's agonising wait finally came to an end at 5pm when Ms Bae and her colleague made a dash for freedom

The siege itself did not come to an end until 2.15am when police stormed the building after hearing gunfire.

Two hostages, 34-year-old cafe manager Tori Johnson and mother of three Katrina Dawson, 38, died. 

Monis was shot dead by police.
