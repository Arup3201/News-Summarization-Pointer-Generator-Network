Romantic break: Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson have embarked on a romantic Caribbean holiday in secret

Pippa Middleton and her boyfriend Nico Jackson have embarked on a romantic Caribbean holiday in secret, according to friends who suspect that they may have become engaged.

Confidants of the couple say that they have been on holiday for two weeks and are believed to be renting a villa on an island, likely  to be Mustique – the exclusive destination where the Middleton clan regularly takes breaks and where Nico first went on holiday with the family.

Miss Middleton, 29, and 35-year-old Mr Jackson have been dating for more than six months, and observers have said the couple have looked ‘closer  than ever’ when out together in recent weeks.

The Mail on Sunday revealed in July that the couple were poised to tie the knot, but were delaying an announcement until Pippa’s sister, the Duchess of Cambridge, safely delivered her baby.

According to reports last night, the couple have become secretly engaged but will not announce it formally until after Pippa’s 30th birthday next Friday.

Mr Jackson, a stockbroker, is said to have been coy about introducing Miss Middleton to his friends in his home town of Folkestone, Kent.

A close friend said last night: ‘We all suspect there’s been an engagement but no one’s been  told yet.

Obviously there’s been a suspicion he’s embarrassed to bring her down to meet his friends, instead he wants to bring us up  to London to meet her soon.

The couple were seen together  at Wimbledon and Miss Middleton wrote in Vanity Fair in the summer about her love of tennis and that, ‘if I had to get married, it would be in my tennis whites – shorts with no pleats or frills’.

Speculation has also been mounting that Princess Beatrice, who is sixth in line to the throne, could soon become engaged to her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark.

Pippa hit the headlines after being a bridesmaid at her sister's wedding in 2011- could she be next to walk down the aisle?
