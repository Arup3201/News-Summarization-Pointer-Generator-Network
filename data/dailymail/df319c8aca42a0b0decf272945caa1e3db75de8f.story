As the centenary of the First World War approaches, Britain prepares to mark the outbreak of one of the largest conflicts in history with sombre remembrance ceremonies.

However, musician Ricky Wilson and actor Bill Nighy have raised eyebrows over their decision to write and record a 21-century war poem inspired by the likes of Wilfred Owen and Sigfried Sassoon.

Called The Occupation the verse talks about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and will be released as part of the band's new album, but has drawn thinly veiled criticism for making commercial gain on the back of the centenary.

A spokesman for The Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which is leading the centenary memorial efforts, said: 'Britain is marking the centenary of the First World War because of its huge impact on world history and as a tribute to the sacrifices made by British and Commonwealth servicemen and civilians.

'The Government’s programme to mark this takes remembrance as its theme, with an emphasis on youth and education. 

'But we appreciate that others will mark the anniversary in different ways, some of which will be challenging and controversial, and some for commercial gain. 

Wilson is also now a judge on The Voice taking over from Danny O'Donoghue who abandoned the programme along with Jessie J last year

'In the end it’s for the public to judge how appropriate each offering is to the memory of those that made the ultimate sacrifice 100 years ago.'

The spokesman added that the Department will not be involving itself with the recording.

Poet and Wilfred Owen scholar Merryn Williams added: 'Obviously it is not a great poem, but it is very amusing.

'I'm not being rude by saying that it doesn't compare to Wilfred Owen because he was one of the best writers this country has produced and he worked at it for years.

'It is up-to-date in a way Owen isn't, although his poetry is timeless.'

The two-minute poem is read by Nighy over a soundtrack of battlefield noises, calls to prayer and hubbub from within the Houses of Parliament.

Speaking to The Independent, Wilson said: 'When I was writing the lyrics for the record, the whole World War One centenary thing was flying around. So if you’re writing honestly, it’s going to leak in there.

'I wrote the poem as an exercise originally. The original story was an imaginary assault by a superpower – not necessarily the USA, trying to take over Hell.

'They are invading Hell, wiping out Hell. Then going "now what do we do, where do we go next?"'

Nighy said he decided to read the poem, which contains references to 'infidels' on their knees and oil pipelines that will 'bleed the place dry', after becoming 'interested by the concept'.

The Kaiser Chief's fifth album, called Education, Education, Education & War in reference to the Tony Blair election slogan, is due for release at the end of March.

While the band enjoyed both popular and critical success in the mid-2000s with their debut album Employment, and the follow-up Yours Truly, Angry Mob, their influence has since waned.

The band took a hiatus after their third album between 2009 and 2011, before releasing their fourth album with the online gimmick of being able to pick between 20 tracks so listeners could create their own record.

They lost drummer Nick Hodgson in 2012 after issuing a compilation album of singles, and front-man Wilson is now a judge on BBC show The Voice, replacing Danny O'Donoghue who walked out along with Jessie J last year.

At the time of publishing, Ricky Wilson could not be reached for comment.

True master: First World War soldier and poet Wilfred Owen who wrote Dulce Et Decorum Est

The Occupation

The occupation of Damnation Eternal

Decreed by Commander in Chief

Won by the infantry, led by the Colonel

Came at costs that would beggar belief

As they marched upon the inferno

And the inﬁdels dropped to their knees

Millions of civilians crammed in pavilions

Came to watch it on big screen TVs

The population of Damnation Eternal

Went from millions to thousands to one

The survivor then wrote in his journal

"Why on Earth did it take them so long?"

Within weeks we constructed a pipeline

Within years we'll have run the place dry

It'll just about last us our lifetime

So it's hip hip hoorays and high ﬁves

On the factory ﬂoor there's a whisper

We built cannons before it began

But the engines still pumping its piston

And the turbine still whirring its fan

The assembly line spits out the surplus

Into purpose built lead lined white vans

Rockets stockpile as ministry workers

Fill their pockets with all that they can

Secret meetings are held in the senate

What to do with this excess supply

There's a plan to abandon the planet

One V.I.P at a time

So we get up each day and have breakfast

Read the news and the weather forecast

As we sit and we open our letters

And we pray that it won't be our last.
