Blaze: A fire at a family home is thought to have been caused by can of hairspray left next to a warm hairdryer 

A fire swept through a family home after a can of hairspray left next to a warm hairdryer was thought to have exploded. 

The woman homeowner, who had been getting ready for work, described hearing two loud bangs moments before she discovered the blaze.

Firefighters battled their way through thick black smoke to tackle the flames in Mapperley, Nottingham, after being alerted to the blast by neighbours.

The woman, her two children and their pet dog escaped the fire, that destroyed their home, unharmed.

Today their charred possessions, including a cabinet and wicker basket, could be seen scattered outside the home.

'The cause is possibly a hairdryer that was left on in a bedroom,' said fire brigade watch manager Paul Meadows.

'The woman was using the hairdryer - we think she put it down and went downstairs.

'She then heard a bang and thought something had fallen. She heard another louder bang and came upstairs to discover the fire.

'She had no smoke alarms so she's been really lucky.

'The bedroom is totally gutted - part of the ceiling is damaged and the floorboards, as well as the hallway.

'There's smoke damage to the rest of the house and downstairs is damaged by water we used.'

 Next door neighbour Daniel Douglas, 26,  woke up  around 8am yesterday with smoke coming through his window. 

'Someone was knocking on my door telling me there was a fire so I got out straight away,' he said.

'I could just see a lot of smoke but couldn't really see the flames.

'It's pretty shocking - I'm gutted for the family. They haven't long moved in.' 

Bangs: Two loud bangs were heard moments before the blaze started, tearing through the Nottingham house

Safe: The homeowner, her two children and the pet dog escaped - but their possessions were left charred

Another said: 'I was having breakfast when I heard a large explosion. At first I thought car had crashed outside but when I saw smoke pouring out of the house down the road.

'It's a freak accident really. Who would have thought a hairdryer could cause that?' 

The family has now been forced to seek alternative accommodation while their home is accessed.   

Remains: The burnt items could be seen in the street the next day, along with the blackened window
