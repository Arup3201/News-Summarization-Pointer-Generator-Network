England were held to a draw in their final World Cup warm-up game against Honduras in Miami. Despite the goalless draw their were plenty of positives for Roy Hodgson, so who has done enough to make the starting line-up for World Cup opener against Italy? MATT BARLOW gives his ratings.

ENGLAND 4-2-3-1

JOE HART: 6 - IN v ITALY.

Clean sheet and some decent saves but not always assured under the high stuff and distribution erratic in first half.

Frustration: England's Daniel Sturridge kicks the post after missing a chance

GLEN JOHNSON: 5. IN.

Made a dreadful start with early slips, not close to his winger. Sloppy in possession at times,

PHIL JAGIELKA: 7. IN.

Solid and dependable. Strong in the air, took few risks but England do have vulnerability about them at the back.

GARY CAHILL: 6. IN.

Defended well, although not always comfortable on the ball as England tried to play it out. Booked.

Mobile: England midfielder Jordan Henderson covered the hard yards

LEIGHTON BAINES: 6. IN.

Endured more than his share of physical attention. Raided forward willingly, not always with great effect. Booked.

JORDAN HENDERSON: 7. ALMOST IN.

Covered the miles in midfield, broke up play and won the ball back, especially in first half.

STEVEN GERRARD: 6. IN.

Passed the ball well. Doesn't always shield centre-halves. Furious with a late tackle in first-half from Luis Garrido.

ADAM LALLANA: 6. MAYBE IN.

Subdued early on, England did not get him on the ball enough. Better after the storm-break. Booked.

Hustle: There was plenty of industry from Wayne Rooney against Honduras

WAYNE ROONEY: 6. IN.

Bustling Rooney rather than silky Rooney. Industrious as ever.Â  Sweet early free-kick saved.

DANNY WELBECK: 7. IN.

Quick and willing between the lines. Sound touch and combines well with Sturridge,

DANIEL STURRIDGE: 6. IN.

Mobile and threatening. Missed trio very good chances, slid one wide and fluffed an attempted chip and headed over.

Threat: England striker Daniel Sturridge (left) missed trio of good chances

SUBS:

JACK WILSHERE (HT for Gerrard) 7 - Good case for being in

Added threat with give-and-go bursts through centre, 7.

ROSS BARKLEY (HT for Rooney) 7 - Good case for being in

Wonderful touches and turn of pace, 7.

FRASER FORSTERÂ  (75 for Hart), 6 OUT.

RICKIE LAMBERT (81 for Welbeck) OUT.

FRANK LAMPARD (83 for Henderson) OUT.
