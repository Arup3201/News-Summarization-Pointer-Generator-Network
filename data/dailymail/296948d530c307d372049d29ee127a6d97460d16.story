Life can be exhausting for new mothers, especially those with several mouths to feed.

After welcoming two pups to the world, new meerkat mum Akili, from Werribee Open Ranges Zoo in Victoria, was left a little tired.

Footage from the zoo's 'burrow cam' shows the sleepy mum falling asleep in quite a dramatic fashion, toppling over from sheer exhaustion after a long day of looking after the lively pair.

The young meerkats, who were welcomed to the world in mid-January, are now six weeks old and very used to feeding while their mum sleeps.

The underground video camera allows Werribee's zoo keepers to carefully monitor the new additions, who generally spend the first few weeks of their life in the burrow.

As their sight and hearing develops, they start to explore their surroundings before venturing out of their home into the open plan zoo enclosure.

When the pups were first born, Akili reportedly spent a few sleepless nights making sure her babies were well fed, but soon leant how to sleep through the process. 

'As the days went on [Akili] became more relaxed and mum very quickly perfected the skill of being able to sleep and nurse at the same time,' Denny Burgoyen, a zookeeper at Werribee.

In the footage, taken two days after the pups were born, the new mum falls fast asleep while the pups are suckling and even the impact of the fall doesn't wake up the exhausted meerkat.

The zoo has reported that the pups are growing well and that Akili has recieved lots of support from the other meerkats in the enclosure.

The pups will be named once their gender has been identified by zoo keepers, which is still a few weeks away. 

'The pups are a lot more confident and are now often spotted playing together in the sand,' Ms Burgoyne said.

Out in the wild, meerkats will live in clans of between ten and 20

'They’re growing up quickly and Akili is receiving lots of support from the rest of the group,' she said.

'It’s quite incredible to see how the adults work together as a team, with each taking turns as sentry to watch over them.'

Out in the wild, meerkats will live in clans of between ten and 20, and are native to countries in the south west of Africa.

A female leader is in charge of each smaller family unit, and the animals spend a large part of their day foraging for food, including beetles, flies, spiders, crickets, and moths.
