It was a blunder he'd prefer to forget, on a day he should remember forever.

Newly-married Richard Bainbridge thanked everyone right down to the tea lady who did the catering in what was, almost, the perfect wedding speech.

But unfortunately for Mr Bainbridge, he managed to accidentally miss out one very, very important person... the beloved mother who brought him up single-handedly.

Ooops! Michelin starred chef Richard Bainbridge, his mother Jill and the Humble Pie he made her after forgetting her in his wedding speech

The 30-year-old Michelin star chef was horrified at forgetting to thank Jill, 65, at the reception he's tried to make it up to her by baking a humble pie.

Mr Bainbridge had overcome his dyslexia to deliver the big speech word-perfect as he tied the knot with bride Katja.

He thanked everyone right down to the tea lady who catered for their reception before leaving for a honeymoon in Iceland.

But as he stepped onto the plane Mr Bainbridge realised what had happened.

His mother helped him battle his dyslexia and supported him in his early days as he tried to make the grade as a chef.

Mr Bainbridge - who was still a young boy when his dad left home - was so mortified he made his own thank you for his mother as soon as he returned from holiday.

He crafted a special large pork pie with the words 'Sorry mum' on the top.

Mr Bainbridge, head chef at the luxury Morston Hall hotel in Norfolk, said: 'The wedding day was absolutely perfect.

'When it came to my speech, I was 
quite nervous and flustered. I did all my thank-yous but somehow, and it
makes me feel sick every time I think about it, I forgot to mention my 
mum.

'Mum got me my first part-time kitchen job when I was just 13 and she has been amazing ever since.

'She's a rubbishy driver but she still used to ferry me all around the country for my work and she really supported me.

'She
is the most important person in my life next to Katja and she means the
world to me. She's been my mother, my father and my best friend. It was
a massive battle for her having to bring up two kids and I love her so 
much.

'She's the most 
inspirational woman I've ever met, the strongest person I've ever known 
and I wouldn't ever want her to feel that I take her for granted.'

Mr Bainbridge
had his sister Gemma, 36, as his 'best woman' - but she was so nervous 
about her own speech she forgot to remind him about their mother.

Mr Bainbridge, of Briston, Norfolk, added: 'I couldn't believe it - the one person who deserved the biggest thanks and I'd forgotten her.

Sweetie pie: Richard Bainbridge was so horrified that he forgot to thank his mum on his wedding day that he has cooked his own piece of humble pie

Mr Bainbridge said of his mother Jill: 'She's the most inspirational woman I've ever met, the strongest person I've ever known and I wouldn't ever want her to feel that I take her for granted'

'I have dyslexia so I didn't have any notes and just did it off the cuff. I thanked everyone down to the tea lady and waiters but forgot the most important person.

'She did that thing that mums do. She said it was fine and that we didn't need to talk about it again but I know that her feelings were hurt.'

Mr Bainbridge recently took part in BBC2's Great British Menu where he created 'something funny on a plate' for Comic Relief and his mother also appeared in the programme.

She helped him get him his first job in a pub when he was just 13 and at 16 he was a pot-washer in the same restaurant where he is now head chef.

During his training Mr Bainbridge has worked alongside the Roux brothers at their famous Waterside Inn at Bray, Berkshire.

Mr Bainbridge and his wife, 29, who have been together for seven years, got married in Briston, Norfolk, on May 25.
