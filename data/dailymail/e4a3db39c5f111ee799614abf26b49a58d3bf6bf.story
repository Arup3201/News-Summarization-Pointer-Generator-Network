The history books for Wales in South Africa do not read well but winger Alex Cuthbert has promised the traditionally slow-starting tourists will be different when they head to the Kruger Park for the second Test.

Wales are licking their wounds from Saturday’s mauling and though low oxygen levels on the high veldt will make this weekend’s encounter even more gruelling, Cuthbert, 24, will take inspiration from recent tours to the Southern Hemisphere.

‘I think they know it is going to be a different Wales team playing them,’ said Cuthbert.

‘It seems to be the same situation as Australia in 2012. We came back fighting in that game and probably should have won the second Test.

‘The last couple of years we have been pretty good away from home. This year we are just dipping. Mentally I don’t think we are quite there.’

Wales have never beaten the Springboks in South Africa and this time it was full back Willie le Roux who inspired the hosts with an impeccable performance.

Wales coach Warren Gatland would have 
expected more from his senior figures and could wield the axe as he 
searches for only a second victory over the big three - Australia, New 
Zealand and South Africa - since he took over in 2007.

It
 is a worrying statistic, particularly looking towards next year’s World
 Cup, but Gatland said: ‘I don’t think there is a lack of belief. They 
bring a lot of pace and physicality and we struggled to cope. We will be
 a lot better next week because we need to be.’
