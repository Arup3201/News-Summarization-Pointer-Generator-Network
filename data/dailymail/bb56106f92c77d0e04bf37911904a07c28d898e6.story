A retired doctor and his wife of more than 60 years died after being involved in a crash with a high-powered sports car, it was revealed today.

Dr Bill Dixon, 89, died instantly in the collision while his wife Gay, 86, was cut free from the car but died in intensive care four days later.

A friend of the grandparents was also in the silver Volkswagen car and was left in a serious condition in hospital.

Two men, aged 19 and 26, who were travelling in the black Mitsubishi Fto sports car, were also badly injured in the two-vehicle crash.

They were in a serious condition after the crash on the A413 Amersham Road in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.

Police, fire crews and paramedics were called to the scene of the high speed crash which happened near the underpass for the M25 motorway.

Family of the Dixons, who were from Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, said 'they will be deeply missed by many friends and family,' in a statement.

Former physiotherapist Gay and her husband had been married for 61 years.

'They were both popular figures in the community of Little Chalfont, having been residents for 45 years,' the family statement said.

'Until his retirement, Bill had been an occupational medicine physician, latterly at John Lewis Partnership, and was a member of a number of professional societies.

'More recently he had been involved with several charities and clubs in the district.

'Gay, previously physiotherapist at Mount Vernon Hospital, Middlesex, was a keen golfer and watercolour painter.

'They enjoyed their 60th wedding anniversary celebrations less than two years ago.'

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said the road was closed for five hours to allow a full investigation into the cause of the collision to take place.

Fire crews from Gerrards Cross, Amersham, Beaconsfield and Hillingdon all attended the scene to cut free the driver and assist in recovering the wrecked vehicles.

Sergeant Dominic Mahon, from Amersham Roads Policing, said: 'The investigation into this tragic collision is still at an early stage and I would urge anyone who witnessed the collision or saw the vehicles involved prior to the collision to contact me.'

The accident happened on Saturday April 20.
