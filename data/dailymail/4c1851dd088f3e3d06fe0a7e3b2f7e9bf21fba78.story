Legal battle: Dentist Anca Macavei, who tried to treat a patient in McDonald's, outside the High Court today, where she is fighting the General Dental Council's decision that she should be struck off

A London dentist who was struck off after trying to work on a woman’s teeth in a McDonald’s restaurant is fighting the decision.

Anca Claudia Macavei attempted to fit a bridge in the mouth of an unnamed patient after setting up a temporary surgery in the fast-food chain's Cannon Street restaurant in 2012.

And when the woman refused to be treated, Miss Macavei insisted that it was necessary and tried to do the work in a hallway of a nearby dental practice.

Miss Macavei, who is registered in Tulcea, Romania, has been suspended since last July when the General Dental Council (GDC) ruled she should be struck off. 

At the time, the GDC said her fitness to practice was ‘impaired’ by misconduct.

Miss Macavei is now fighting a last-ditch battle to overturn that decision at the High Court.

Miss Macvei had previously practised in Tavistock, Devon, but was living in London and advertising for Romanian patients online when she met Patient 1.

She had an informal arrangement to use the Cannon Street Practice surgery on an ‘ad-hoc basis’ for seeing patients.

But her relationship with the practice manager deteriorated and she was stuck with only limited access to the premises.

On February 18, 2012, she met with Patient 1 in a McDonald’s close to the surgery.

Last July, the GDC professional conduct committee found, on the balance of probabilities, that she had tried to work on the woman’s teeth in the restaurant.

‘Patient 1 was clear and specific in her evidence on this issue,’ it said in its decision.

‘She stated that you tried to put bridges in her mouth whilst in the McDonald’s and, when she refused, you insisted that it was necessary, to see if they would fit.

‘You confirmed in evidence that your access rights to the Cannon Street Practice had already been withdrawn by the time you met with Patient 1 at McDonald’s.

‘In the circumstances, the committee found that it was more likely than not that you did attempt a fitting of the bridges in that unsuitable environment, considering that you had nowhere else to go at that time.

‘The committee was satisfied on the balance of probabilities that you also attempted to provide dental treatment to Patient 1 in the hallway outside the Cannon Street Practice.

‘Both you and Patient 1 recalled that when you left McDonald’s, the entrance to the practice was open, as renovation work was being carried out.

‘Patient 1 told the committee that you both entered the hallway of the practice, where you tried again to fit the bridges.

‘She said that you told her that you had no access to your surgery because you had lost the key.

‘The committee found that it was more likely than not that this did happen following your failed attempt to fit the bridges in a more public setting where the patient was understandably uncomfortable.’

She was also found responsible for a ‘catalogue’ of other failings in her work with the patient and another.

Miss Macavei, who is registered in Tulcea, Romania, but lives in London, was visibly emotional as she addressed the judge at the High Court today.

She claims that the GDC’s decision to erase her name from the register was ‘disproportionate’. Suspension or conditions on her practice would have sufficed.

James Townsend, for the GDC, is contesting Miss Macavei’s application.

He said: ‘Given Ms Macavei’s catalogue of failings, lack of insight and failure to engage over more than two years with an attempt to help her, then to engage in a half-hearted way, the GDC submits that it cannot possibly be said that the decision of the professional conduct committee was wrong.’

The GDC made its decision to strike Miss Macavei off last July and she has been suspended since then pending her appeal to the High Court.

Mrs Justice Patterson reserved judgment and will decide Miss Macavei’s future at a later date.
