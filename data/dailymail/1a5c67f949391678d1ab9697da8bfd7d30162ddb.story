She puts her body through a gruelling physical regime just like any world class athlete.

But British Olympic star Victoria Pendleton showed an extra level of battling quality today while pursuing her latest cycling crown.

The 31-year-old, who will be hoping to retain her Olympic crown in London this summer, displayed steely determination while regaining her Track Cycling World Championships title.

Pendleton had been battling Australian Anna Meares in the semi-final of the event when she dramatically crashed from her bike in the first race bout.

Stunned spectators saw the Briton race wheel to wheel against Meares before the pair rounded a corner and Pendleton's front wheel skidded off course in front of her.

Pendleton tumbled inches from her opponent's front wheel before skidding for metres along the wooden track.

Putting her body on the line: Pendleton, with her body still on her bike, skidded along the track and sustained track burns to her shoulder, elbow and hip

Members of the British team rushed to the
Olympic champion's aid after her crash, as Pendleton lay at the side of
the track and removed her helmet.

Pendleton escaped major injury despite the serious-looking fall, sustaining track burn on her right shoulder, elbow and hip.

Showing the admirable battling qualities which have made her a nine-time world champion, Pendleton dusted herself down and fought through the semi-final against home favourite Meares.

The Australian, competing in front of a home crowd in Melbourne, was adjudged to have impeded her opponent by going outside the sprinters' lane in the following bout.

Then, in a spectacular deciding race, Pendleton again cycled wheel-to-wheel against her arch rival with burns clearly showing through holes in her lycra suit, but managed to snatch victory in a photo finish.

Even without her injury, the achievement 
was no mean feat, as her fierce rival Meares had broken a world record 
in qualifying before defeat to Pendleton.

After the crash, Pendleton played down the crash which led to her being heavily bandaged before the final.

She told BBC Sport: 'It's not too bad. I lost my balance, went too far in one direction and lost my traction.

'My dad always said you don't do track cycling unless you're prepared to crash.

'I slid quite nicely, which sounds random, and I felt fine. I could tell it was just surface wounds.'

Her
Australian opponent said after the incident: 'I was right next to her: I
heard it, saw it and felt it, the vibrations through the wood.

'Even if she'd held it up, she'd probably have been relegated for moving out, just as I was in the second round.

'I then made a technical error in the second round and a tactical error in the third. It's so deflating.'

'For
her to pick herself up after that heavy fall and come back as hard as 
she did is a mark of the woman and the great champion that she is.'

Pendleton,
who plans to retire after the London Olympics, went on to win her ninth
world title in all, with one keirin - an event in which she is set to 
ride on Saturday - and two team sprint wins to her name.

She
claimed a 2-0 final win over Lithuania's Simona Krupeckaite to win the 
title for a sixth time after successes in 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 
2010.

The Briton won the 
first of the best-of-three final before Krupeckaite was disqualified for
impeding in the second match - handing Pendleton victory.
