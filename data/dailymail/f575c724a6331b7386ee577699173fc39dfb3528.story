In some ways Alicia Young is very camera shy. And in others she really, really isn't.

The well-endowed brunette has become an internet sensation after launching a blog on which she posts a daily photograph of her impressive cleavage - but she has never once revealed her face, leading to speculation about who she is and whether or not Alicia Young is even her real name.

Some have even joked that reluctance to unveil herself insinuates she is perhaps not quite as attractive as her ample bosom suggests.

Alicia's site - Los Escotes De Alicia, which translates as Alicia's Low-Cut Tops - is thought to be based in Valencia, Spain, and has already notched up over three million hits since its launch in November.

At one point yesterday blog traffic peaked at 170,000.

Alicia Young posts daily photographs of her cleavage on her blog

The mystery blogger, who claims to be 31 and is thought to be a Brit living in Spain, posts photographs of herself while engaged in a number of activities, from eating and drinking to reading and hanging Christmas decorations.

In each photograph she wears tight or revealing tops - and sometimes nothing at all, covering her modesty with only her hands, or props including hats and books. Occasionally her cleavage has been penned with words, names and phrases.

Every post is accompanied by Spanish text explaining what she's been up to each day, such as hanging out with friends or doing 'a little bit of work'.

Alicia also uses her Twitter page to post cleavage shots, and it is thought she hopes to eventually secure a lucrative deal for publication.
