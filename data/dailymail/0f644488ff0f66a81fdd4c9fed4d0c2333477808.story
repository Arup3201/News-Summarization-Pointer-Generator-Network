A fast food worker who has been on the run from police for nearly a year after he was accused of spying on female colleagues has been warned detectives are on his tail after he posted clips of himself singing pop songs on YouTube.

Dominik Selchert, 27, was due to stand trial accused of voyeurism after an iPhone was found hidden in female staff toilets at the Bromley branch of KFC where he was assistant manager.

He failed to appear at Croydon Crown Court last July and has not been seen since - until these clips of him singing hits by One Direction and Michael Jackson appeared on the net.

A mobile phone was found in the female staff toilets of this KFC branch in Bromley where Selchert worked

Today a police source said they were aware of the new videos and were 'on the case'.

The videos, which were uploaded to YouTube on May 30 this year, apparently by Selchert himself, show him singing into the camera.

In one, filmed in what appears to be an attic room, Selchert, formerly of Lewisham, south London, sings the One Direction hit What Makes You Beautiful.

Dressed in baggy grey tracksuit bottoms and a white t-shirt, and wearing a silver chain around his neck, Selchert gives the camera a thumbs up before closing his eyes and singing the boyband's hit.

In the second clip, he sings 58 seconds of Michael Jackson's Man In The Mirror and accompanies himself on the guitar.

Selchert has also tweeted about wanting to appear on X Factor, although his Twitter account has been inactive since last November.

His last court appearance was on March 5 last year, when he pleaded not guilty to voyeurism, but he failed to appear at court for his trial on July 9 last year.

The court case came after allegations that female staff had been filmed getting dressed for work in the fried chicken restaurant in High Street, Bromley, in August 2011.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We are still seeking to trace Mr Selchert as he failed to appear at court last year to answer the charge against him.

'He has certainly helped us by posting these videos of himself singing online, so it should not be long before he is back before the courts.

Selchert appeared in court last March to plead not guilty but did not attend for his trial in July last year

'We have passed the details of these videos to officers looking for Mr Selchert.'

He said it was possible to trace where the videos were uploaded and that officers were working on apprehending the suspect.

The spokesman added: 'We would ask anyone who knows Mr Selchert's whereabouts to call Bromley Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
