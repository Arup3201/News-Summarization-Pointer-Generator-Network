Liverpool striker Divock Origi has revealed he is in regular contact with Brendan Rodgers as he aims to impress during his loan spell back in France at Lille.

The Belgium international has scored four times in five starts for the French club on loan this season since signing for Liverpool from Lille for £10million this summer.

Origi was sent back to Ligue 1 for this season following the arrival of Mario Balotelli at Anfield but insists he has not been forgotten by Liverpool.

The Belgium international has scored four goals in five starts for the Ligue 1 club so far this season 

'Brendan Rodgers keeps in touch when he can because he's a busy man,' Origi told Sky Sports News.

'Sometimes he sends me some messages and sometimes people from Liverpool come and visit me in Lille.

'It's good to know they are following my progress.

'Things are going well but there's still some room for improvement. I'm still working hard trying to prepare myself for a higher level.

'I'm feeling good and ready to continue this form.'

Liverpool's have endured a mixed start to the current season, with Saturday's 2-1 win over West Brom lifting Brendan Rodgers' side to ninth in the Premier League and ending a run of just one point from three games.

However Origi has watched closely and believes his parent club will hit form soon.

'It's a new era at Liverpool and everything will go well. They have a fantastic team: Balotelli is a great striker, they have Daniel Sturridge and they have Raheem Sterling - one of the best young talents in the world.

'It's only positive and I don't think we have to worry about Liverpool.'
