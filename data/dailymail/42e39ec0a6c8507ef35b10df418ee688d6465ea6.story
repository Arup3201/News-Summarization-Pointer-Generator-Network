Researchers have looked into what makes a long-term relationship work

Thinking your partner is better than you could be the key to a long-lasting relationship, researchers have claimed.

A review of nine studies into long-term relationships has concluded that rose-coloured glasses are indeed 'good for relationships'.

A paper by the Australian Institute of Family Studies suggests that focusing on the best parts of someone could be the way forward if you want to avoid a split in the long-term.

'Individual partners feel happier when their spouse or partner has a "shinier" view of them than they have of themselves,' the paper claims.

It defines a long-term relationship as one that lasts between 11 to 56 years.

The authors of the paper, Robyn Parker, Senior Manager, Research and Evaluation at Interrelate Family Centres, and Joanne Commerford, Research Officer at the Australian Institute of Family Studies, pointed to 2011 research by Claxton, O'Rourke, Smith and DeLongis.

Their research found that wives were happier when there was a positive difference between their own ratings and their husbands' ratings of themselves on neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness.

'Partner similarity and viewing partners through rose-coloured glasses appear to underpin marital satisfaction, although in different ways for women and men,' the authors explained.

The research paper looked at the key aspects relating to long-term relationships, including commitment, personality traits, transition to parenthood, health, and satisfaction and stability.

When it comes to commitment, the study found that simply wanting the relationship to continue is not enough. Couples must 'address difficult issues in the short term' for them to be beneficial in the long run.

The study also noted that becoming a parent is a critical time for couples when predicting their satisfaction and stability going forward.

The paper comes after figures from the Australian Institute of Family Studies last year showed a big increase in people divorcing after 20 years or more of marriage.

AIFS' Director, Professor Alan Hayes said that the proportion of divorces ending after twenty years had increased from 13 per cent in 1990 to 28 per cent in 2011.

'Divorce trends have been heavily influenced by changing social norms about remaining in unhappy marriages. There is far less social stigma today about ending a marriage and women are less reliant on men for their financial stability,' Professor Hayes said.
