Luke Shaw might be a £31million Manchester United star and England defender but that did not stop him being turned away from the X Factor's live show in London on Sunday after arriving late.

The 19-year-old, who was voted man of the match by the United fans for his performance in their 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday, travelled down to Wembley for the show, only to be turned away by security after turning up five minutes late.

Luckily, Shaw saw the funny side of things after posting on Twitter: 'All the way to London to watch X factor then get there 5 mins late and not being allowed in.'

One can assume that the former Southampton starlet didn't play the celebrity card after being turned away after such a long trip.

On the field things have certainly been improving for Shaw though - he has started United's last four league games, with Louis van Gaal's side losing just once in that time.

There is plenty of room for improvement for the Red Devils though, as they sit seventh in the Premier League, already 13 points behind the leaders Chelsea after 11 games played.
