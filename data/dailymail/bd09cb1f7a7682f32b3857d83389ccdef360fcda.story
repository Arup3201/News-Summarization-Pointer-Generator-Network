Four rare white lion cubs born in a UK safari park have been sent to perform in a Japanese circus after being trained in a British facility.

The cubs were born at West Midlands Safari Park, in Bewdley, Worcester, in 2008 but will spend their adult lives entertaining crowds in the Far East.

Animal rights charities have expressed outrage after discovering they were flown 6,000 miles to Japan’s Circus Kinoshita.

The safari park has been criticised for providing four rare white lion cubs to a businessman who provided them to a Japanese circus

It is understood one of the lions has since moved to a zoo in western Japan after it developed a nervous condition which caused its mane to fall out.

The animals were given to British businessman Jim Clubb who runs Amazing Animals, which also goes by the name Heythrop Zoological Gardens, in Chipping Norton, Oxon.

Undercover video footage taken by Captive Animals’ Protection Society (CAPS) and Lion Aid taken in 2010 appears to show Clubb training the lion cubs during an open day at his firm.

Months later the same lions were seen performing for a Japanese circus.

The Kinoshita Circus website boasts that four white lions currently being used in shows were all born in a UK zoo and trained at a UK site.

It states: 'When they became six months old, they were moved to an animal training facility in UK.

'They began training there when they were 18 months old.'

A Japanese investigator working for 
CAPS discovered one of the lions has been moved to a zoo in the west of 
the country after it was attacked by the other circus animals.

The lion is reported to have developed a 'nervous disease called autonomic ataxia' causing his mane to completely fall out.

Animal rights campaigners have criticised the safari park for allowing the lions to end up in a circus.

The four cubs were among eight  born at West Midlands Safari Park in Bewdley in 2008 and sent to Amazing Animals of Chipping Norton, Oxon, aged six months

CAPS director Liz Tyson said: 'The current Government has promised an outright ban on the use of wild animals in circuses as a result of overwhelming public, expert and parliamentary support.

'And yet here we have a zoo apparently providing lion cubs to this cruel and unethical trade via a middleman, whilst publicising their work to their paying visitors as based in conservation and welfare.

'It is an appalling betrayal of those people that trust the zoo to protect and care for the animals.

'But most importantly, it is an appalling betrayal of the lion cubs who appear to have been abandoned to this hopeless fate by West Midland Safari Park.'

An investigation by CAPS claim the safari park has close ties with Clubb’s animal entertainment business.

In
 2007 Clubb appeared on the zoo’s own TV channel talking about his 
company which provides animals to the entertainment industry.

Jim Clubb, owner of Amazing Animals, yesterday confirmed he had provided the lions to the circus - saying it was 'business.'

He said: 'We did receive the lion cubs from West Midlands Safari Park and provided them to the circus in Japan.

'There is nothing illegal or underhand about this whatsoever. I will not discuss our financial arrangements but we are a business of course.

'I have no idea whether West Midlands Safari Park knew the lions would be going to the circus, that is a matter for them. I will not go into the arrangement we have with them.'

The safari park - which attracts 1.3 million visitors each year - confirmed they had 'sent' white lions to Clubb 'in good faith.'

Safari park spokeswoman Wendy Jackson said: 'West Midland Safari Park sent white lions to Heythrop Zoological Gardens in good faith and were unaware of any subsequent moves.'
