A British ex-pat accused of punching a suspected paedophile to death in a Spanish restaurant may have been friends with his alleged victim, it emerged today.

Devinder Kainth allegedly attacked Sandro Rottman after catching him photographing his young daughter.

Kainth, 39, had been enjoying a meal with his girlfriend Gemma Hawkins, 31, and their three children in the millionaire's playground of Sotogrande on the Costa del Sol in Spain.

A source today revealed the two men and other friends had been socialising together freely and were in good humour for a couple of hours before the incident.

A British ex-pat, Fiona Goodwood – who has known Rottman for the last 12 years – also claimed there had been a 'good friendship' between the pair. 

Meanwhile, Ms Hawkins has vowed to stand by her man, but says she will return  to the UK to get the support of her family, according to friends.

Charged: Devinder Kainth (pictured with his girlfriend Gemma Hawkins) may have been friends with a suspected paedophile he is accused of beating to death after catching him photographing his  daughter

Unsettling: Mr Rottman, 43, who was arrested over child pornography a few days before his death, had posted this image on Twitter showing him holding a young girl to his chest

A witness said Ms Hawkins entered the Spinnaker Restaurant with a female friend and the three children at around 5pm last Saturday.

He said: 'The children ran around the restaurant causing chaos and cycled in and out of the restaurant with their bikes while the women ordered a couple of glasses of wine and chatted.'

About an hour later, a male friend joined them at their table who is believed to be the partner of Ms Hawkins' friend.

Mr Rottman is said to have arrived at a similar time and was seen standing by their table chatting and laughing.

Ms Hawkins is understood to have offered him at least one drink.

Mr Rottman paid nothing throughout the evening, the source added.

At around 6.30pm-7pm, Kainth, also known as Victor, arrived and the group continued to chat and everything seemed 'good humoured'.

'They were definitely not drinking that much as the bill was not that big but they were having fun,' the source said.

'The children were clearly enjoying themselves on their bikes and being like typical noisy children.' 

According to witnesses, Mr Kainth and his partner, Gemma Hawkins, were eating with their three children (pictured, above, with Ms Hawkins) when they started chatting to Sandro Rottman

Two of the couple's children attend one of the most exclusive schools on the Spanish coast where fees are around 10,000 euros a year. The third goes to nursery

The millionaire, who is a keen boxer, allegedly caught Rottman photographing his daughter on an iPad and confronted him before attacking him at around 9.20pm.

According to the source, the CCTV doesn't show what happened next as one of the cameras wasn't working.  

At 9.30pm, the security were called and were on the scene within minutes.

The police finally arrived on Tuesday night to take the CCTV from the restaurant, with the restaurant source confirming that it was now being studied as further evidence.

When contacted last night, a member of staff at the restaurant confirmed that police had finally taken the CCTV but insisted he was 'unable to comment for legal reasons'. 

Rottman, 43, later died from his injuries in hospital.

Kainth was later arrested and is being held at maximum-security Botaguegos Prison in the southern Spanish port city of Algeciras on suspicion of homicide.

Yesterday, Miss Hawkins told a friend that she would stand by the millionaire, but needed to come home to her family for emotional support while he was in prison.

He is believed to have been refused bail but Miss Hawkins is thought not to have visited him at the prison. 

'Attached himself to the couple': Sandro Rottman (left), a suspected paedophile allegedly beaten to death by a British ex-pat in Spain, is said to have acted as an assistant to Katie Price and her ex-husband Alex Reid in Sotogrande during the launch of her polo clothing range in August 2009 (above)

'Beaten to death': Mr Rottman died on Sunday after a man named locally as Devinder Kainth, 40, caught him photographing his daughter on an iPad and attacked him in a restaurant in the Spanish resort of Sotogrande

A source close to the investigation said: 'He has hired his own defence lawyer. He was offered a duty lawyer after he was arrested but wanted to go with his own brief.'

Yesterday, Miss Hawkins' mother Denise said from her detached home in Kent: 'Gemma is a lovely girl. She has a strong close family and a great group of friends out there.

'I've spoken to her about what happened and it's as has been reported in the papers.

'The children mean everything to her and the most important thing is that they are safe and well and so is she.

'I'm hoping to go out and see her at some stage.'  

Yesterday, it also emerged that suspected paedophile Sandro Rottman apparently acted as an assistant to glamour model Katie Price.

Photographs show Rottman with the model and her ex-husband Alex Reid in Sotogrande during the launch of her polo riding range in August 2009.

Fiona Goodwood – who has known Mr Rottman for the last 12 years and described him as 'something of an eccentric character' – said he told her he had assisted Miss Price on the trip. 

The altercation happened at the The Spinnaker, pictured above, in Sotogrande on Spain's Costa del Sol on Saturday night after Devinder Kainth  reportedly saw Sandro Rottman filming his daughter

It is claimed that Mr Rottman was very close to the entourage and was involved in organising the event.  

Another British expat who has known Mr Rottman for eight years claimed he had 'attached himself to the couple' when Miss Price came to open her clothes line KP Equestrian in the resort. 

The source said: 'He had slick-backed hair and was always dressed very smartly'.

A spokeswoman for Miss Price told MailOnline: 'Katie was present at an event where Mr Rottman was working for the organisers.'

In a full statement she said: 'I had no recollection of meeting him as he was not my assistant but it appears I did during the course of my one day working trip to Sotogrande promoting KP equestrian. This is clearly a tragic incident that will impact the families of all involved.'

A spokesman for the Santa Maria Polo Club said yesterday: 'Katie Price's visit must have been a private visit.

'More than 70,000 spectators, including many British visitors, come to see our International Summer tournament every year.

'We do not know if Katie Price hired Sandro Rottman's services. We can state categorically that Mr Rottman never had any type of working relationship with Santa Maria Polo Club.'  

 

He has been described as ‘something of an eccentric character’ who was well known for years around the exclusive resort of Sotogrande.

But as yet very little else is known about Sandro Rottman, right.

The 43-year-old German is understood to have been charged with child pornography a month before he was allegedly battered to death for filming a British father’s daughter at a restaurant.

But British expat Fiona Goodwood – who has known Mr Rottman for the last 12 years – has dismissed claims he had been engaging in paedophilia.

She said: ‘If Mr Rottmann had been charged before as reported, it would be very unlikely that he would be sitting in a public place brazenly doing what he had been accused of?’

Mrs Goodwood also found it hard to believe he would have been caught with child porn images because she knew him as such a skilled computer programmer.

She said: ‘All his work that I have seen him carry out previously was meticulously passworded.

'I find it very hard to believe that if there were any pornographic images, as has been claimed, that he would be so naive as not have password protected them and made it very difficult to access especially in the circumstances described.’ 

Mr Rottman appears to have held down a number of different jobs, being variously described by locals as a web designer, IT consultant and he once even helped to organise the launch of Katie Price’s polo clothing range. 

Meanwhile, other locals say they knew him as a drunk who was once so intoxicated he fell into the sea and had to be fished out.

He walked with a limp and is thought to have been treated for a liver problem previously.

A worker at the exclusive El Octogano Beach Club, near The Spinnaker Restaurant where Rottman was killed on Saturday, said: ‘He had a drink problem and would get through up to three bottles of vodka a day.

‘He’s been banned for the past year because he ran up a huge bill he never paid.

‘He’d fallen on hard times after making a lot of money during the boom years in Spain when he was spending £50 a day on drink.

‘He was always on his own and always on his computer because that was how he made his money but I never saw him misbehaving.’
