Crystal Palace are trying to extend the contracts of key duo Joel Ward and Damien Delaney.

Talks over new deals for the defensive pair have opened with Palace officials working on finding a resolution.

Ward and Delaney played a key role in keeping Palace up last season and the Selhurst Park club want to reward them.

The Eagles are also keen on tying left back Joel Ward down to a new deal at Selhurst Park 

Delaney’s deal expires at the end of the season, while Ward’s contract has two more years left to run.

An extension for Delaney is understood to be at a more advanced stage than the move to sign Ward to fresh terms.

Delaney was given his marching orders by referee Craig Pawson after two bookings during the 2-1 defeat against Chelsea on Saturday.
