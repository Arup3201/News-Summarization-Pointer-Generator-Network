A longtime fire department employee is fighting back after being dismissed for what her supervisors called racially-charged comments on Facebook about the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson. 

Crystal Eschert was a fire investigator for the Charlotte Fired Department when she took to Facebook wonder why a police shooting near Ferguson wasn't getting the same level of attention as Brown's death.

'Where is Obama?' she wrote on Facebook. 'Where is Holder? Where is Al Sharpton? Where are Trayvon Martin’s parents? Where are all the white guy supports? So WHY is everyone MAKING it a racial issue?!? So tired of hearing it’s a racial thing. If you are a thug and worthless to society, it’s not race -- You’re just a waste no matter what religion, race or sex you are!'

WFAE reports that that Charlotte City Manager Ron Carlee said the comments were considered discriminatory. 

When someone emailed the comments from the page - which had been sent to private - to city hall, Eschert was fired. 

At least one legal expert says the post should be considered protected free speech.

'She said something that at best was racially insensitive, but on a public issue on a private page,' Guy Charles of Duke University’s Center on Law, Race and Politics told reporters. 'Between the hand that she’s holding and the hand that the city’s holding, I think I’d prefer to have her hand.'

But UCLA Law Professor Eugene Volokh says it's not so clear cut.

'I’m inclined to say the employee has a pretty strong case here, but when it comes to the government acting as an employer, the legal rules are quite vague,' he said.

Eschert said she believes she really lost her job for raising concerns about a building being used by fire employees

Eschert said she believes the Facebook post is just a convenient excuse for the real motivation behind her firing.

She had recently raised concerns about a building that fire employees were using on North Graham Street.

'There was an elevator that went from the basement up and it was wooden. And when we went in the spring, it didn't want to work too well. So we had to jump to make it function,' Eschert told WSOCTV.

'I saw wires hanging down, whether they were phone wires or electric wires,' she said. 'I didn't feel at that point it was safe -- absolutely not.'

Her recent performance reviews had also praised the quality of her work. 

Eschert said she couldn't keep silent about the building's issues, and strongly believes that it was her objections to safety issues that made her a target.

'The type of work that we do, security is a massive concern,' she said.
