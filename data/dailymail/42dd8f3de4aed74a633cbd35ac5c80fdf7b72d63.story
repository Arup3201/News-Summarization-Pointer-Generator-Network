An Ohio dad recently turned his own son over to police after finding photos the 15-year-old had taken of neighborhood women through their bedroom windows.

The unidentified Grandview Heights dad was merely curious after finding a camera memory card in his son's laundry. When he saw was on on the card, he was appalled.

'I'm ashamed. I feel like I have failed as a parent,' he told WBNS.

On the card were photos of three different women, some photos in the nude others not.

Peeping Tom: A father in central Ohio has turned his son into local police after he found photos of neighborhood women taken through their bedroom windows in the boy's possession

Evidence: The father found the photos on a memory card he found while doing the boy's laundry

The teen's father said he was doing his son's laundry when he found a memory card with photos and videos of women around from the neighborhood near Columbus.

'It was just feelings of disgust flowing through me, like why would somebody do this to another human being,' said the dad.

The father said he confronted his son, who admitted to taking the photos through the windows of nearby homes. The father called the police and gave them the memory card.

The father explained to WBNS: 

'He has to, I guess, face the consequences for his actions. There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. I, as a parent, cannot do what's wrong to try to cover up something my son did that was wrong. I have to do what's right, regardless.'

As of Tuesday, one of the three victims has been identified. 

Police say they're continuing to search the teen's electronics and are working to identify and contact the three women in the photos.

Charges haven't been filed.

Three women from the comfortable town of Grandview Heights outside Columbus were on the card. Some photos were taken in the nude, others were not
