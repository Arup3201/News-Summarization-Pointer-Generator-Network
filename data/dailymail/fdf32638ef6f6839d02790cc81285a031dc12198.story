Until now, Andermatt in Switzerland has been less known as a ski destination and  better remembered for a James Bond car chase where Sean Connery zips along the nearby Fruka Pass in an Aston Martin DB5 during Goldfinger.

In the last year however, the modest ski resort has been placed  on the map thanks to the opening of The Chedi Andermatt.

Tucked in the heart of the Swiss Alps, the hotel is a Goliath of a building, and the first five-star hotel to come to the sleepy area. The Chedi is drawing a very different clientele to the village including business types from Zurich and models from Milan. I visited it on the first day it opened for the 2014/15 winter season  to see whether it lived up to the hype.

Jean-Michel Gathy has given the hotel a Asian-Alpine twist and every one of the bathrooms heave with Aqua di Parma toiletries

Designed by lauded architect Jean-Michel Gathy it’s an opulent, high-ceilinged series of four buildings with fur-lined sofas and glittering surfaces. Every room, corridor and restaurant is given Gathy's signature Asian-Alpine twist, which sounds oxymoronic, but works, giving the building the feeling of a dark, brooding Bond villain’s lair.

The Chedi has 105 rooms including their prized Furka suite (£5,275 per night): a 3,552sq ft luxury abode for six people including a personal spa with steam bath, sauna and Jacuzzi. 

Visitors are allocated a ski butler to fit their skis, get their poles, warm their boots and take care of all kit requirements

Lighting, heating, curtains and gas fires in every room are controlled by the flick of an iPad and the hotel spans four buildings

Situated at the crossroads of three mountain passes in Urserental, the village of Andermatt is accessible via three alpine passes

More modest suites – if you can call them that - cost from £420 per night and come with a handmade Hastens bed, the same mattress makers that the king and queen of Sweden use. Mine was so comfortable it almost hurt to leave and the room was beautifully furnished with a lengthy balcony and cashmere shawls should you need some fresh air.

Downstairs, there’s a wine and cigar library, a walk-in humidor cheese room, a limousine service, a fleet of Audis to collect you from the slopes, two restaurants and plans for an ice rink next year. The piano in the lobby constantly tinkles come drinks o’clock and you’ll see more cashmere in a hour there than you did watching Cameron Diaz in The Holiday.

The hotel has a 35m indoor pool and a 12m outdoor one where guests can relax after a long day on the Saint-Gotthard Massif mountains

The Furka suite (£5,275 per night) is a 3,552sq ft abode for six people including a personal spa with steam bath, sauna and Jacuzzi

The spa stretches 7,900sq ft  and is easy to get lost in. Guests can pick between hydrotherapy pools, a Finnish sauna and hammam, steam rooms, a plunge pool and myriad treatment rooms. I tried a 60-minute Alpine massage (200 CHF or £132) that was one of the best I’ve ever had. 

Afterwards  take a dip in the 35m indoor pool or 12m outdoor one - although as you swim lengths indoors those sipping champagne from the lobby can watch you through a huge glass window; a slightly odd design spec.

Best of all though, visitors are allocated a ski butler to fit their skis, get their poles, warm their boots and take care of all  kit requirements.

If you're a keen skier you’ll happily spend a week here although the runs are more limited than other parts of Europe. The skiing area is slowly expanding with more chair lifts built or renovated year-on-year and there are cosy restaurants where you can eat schnitzel to your hearts content without weeping when the bill comes.

During the summer there is still a lot to do in Andermatt. Play on a 18-hole championship golf course or try cycling tours, hikes, horse riding, fishing and tennis. It’s a beautiful area, surrounded by high peaks of the Saint-Gotthard Massif, deep canyons, wild waterfalls and quiet mountain lakes.

Situated at the crossroads of three mountain passes in Urserental, Andermatt is accessible via three alpine passes: the Oberalp Pass to the east, the St. Gotthard Pass in the south and the Furka Pass in the west, while the Schöllenen gorge is in the north.

Visitors can get to Andermatt from Stuttgart or Munich in four hours, from Milan in two hours and Zurich in 90 minutes.
