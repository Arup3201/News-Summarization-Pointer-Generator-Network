Samantha Geimer is now on email terms with Roman Polanski, she has revealed. Here she is pictured at the premiere of 'Roman Polanski: Wanted And Desired' at The Paris Theatre in New York City in 2008

Nearly 40 years after she accused film-maker Roman Polanski of raping her in the jaccuzzi at Jack Nicholson's house, Samantha Geimer has revealed the pair are still in touch.

Polanski, who was 44 at the time, fled the the US the day before he was due to be sentenced in 1977 and has been exiled ever since.

Over the past few years Ms Geimer, who was just 13, and Polanski have written to each other by email.

In one of the emails to Ms Geimer, Polanski expressed concerns at a rumour that the title of the French version of the memior she will publish next week would mention the word 'rape'.

She replied, assuring him that it would not.

The scandal shocked highfliers in the film world and destroyed Polanski's career in Hollywood. It turned him into one of the country's most high profile fugitives.

Now she regards him as an ally, according to The Times newspaper in London.

She tells the paper: 'People are still coming after both of us. We're both still being treated unfairly. It makes sense to be on the same side.'

She adds that both of them have been abused by the media and the US justice system.

Ms Geimer talks in detail about the attack. She was picked up by Polanski in his hired Mercedes and driven to Nicholson's house for a magazine shoot. He wanted to take pictures of her.

The story has been written many times since the day in 1977, but Ms Geimer goes on to say Polanski, now a father of two, gave her 'four or five' glasses of champagne and part of a sleeping pill before the shoot.

He told her to strip and she claimed he had sex with her, and sodomised her despite her protests.

Polanski, however, has said the sex was consensual.

Despite the horrific events, Ms Geimer says what followed was worse than the actual rape.

'If I had to choose between reliving the rape or [that testimony], I would choose the rape,' she says.

Now she considers Polanski a victim as well because of the judge's collusion with the media. The late Judge Laurence J. Rittenband, she claims, told newspaper reporters what sentence Polanski should face.

He was not convicted of rape, but had pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor.

But it was when Rittenband reneged on his promise that Polanski should serve no more than 90 days psychological evaluation in a California prison, because he feared a backlash, that Polanski fled.

The director wrote a letter of apology to Ms Geimer in 2009.
