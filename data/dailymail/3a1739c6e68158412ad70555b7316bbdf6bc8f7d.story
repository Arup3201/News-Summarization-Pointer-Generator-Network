Icon: Rapper Jay Z has been named as one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine

The controversial leader of North Korea has been named in Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Kim Jong Un has joined President Obama, Jay-Z and Taliban shooting victim Malala Yousafzai on the star-studded list.

The publication has printed its annual Time 100 and for the first time this year features seven special edition front covers each showing one of the members.

They include actress Jennifer Lawrence, business mogul Elon Musk, Senator Rand Paul, tennis star Li Na, Indian actor Aamir Khan and Pakistani schoolgirl and activist Malala Yousafzai.

Malala made world headlines around the world when survived being shot in the head by the Taliban in revenge for her standing up for the right to go to school in her home country.

The 15-year-old spent hours undergoing 
major surgery at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham where 
surgeons tried to repair the damage caused by a bullet which grazed her 
brain.

She has since set up the Malala Fun, a charity to help educate children in her home country.

Also appearing are
 President Obama, for the eighth time, and his wife Michelle, as well as several celebrities, including Justin Timberlake, Breaking Bad star 
Bryan Cranston, Oscar-winning actor Daniel Day-Lewis, talk show host 
Jimmy Fallon and singers Christina Aguilera and Beyonce.

The issue, which goes on sale tomorrow, features a profile of each entrant written by another high-profile star.

Jay-Z was profiled by Michael Bloomberg, who wrote: 'Jay-Z embodies so much of what makes New York,
 New York.

'A kid from a tough neighbourhood who grows up in public 
housing, overcomes lots of bad influences on the street, never lets go 
of his dream, makes it to the top - and then keeps going, pursuing new 
outlets for his creativity and ambition.

'When no one would sign him to a 
record contract, he created his own label and built a music empire - 
before going on to design clothing lines, open sports bars and, most 
recently, represent professional athletes.

Charismatic: For the first time this year, the magazine is producing seven front covers featuring a member on the list, including actress Jennifer Lawrence (left) and PayPal co-founder Elon Musk (right)

Honoured: Taliban shooting victim Malala Yousafzai (left) and Indian film actor Aamir Khan (right) also feature

'In nearly everything he's 
tried, he's found success. (He even put a ring on Beyonce.) And in doing
 so, he's proved that the American Dream is alive and well.'

Meanwhile, Lawrence was praised by 
Jodie Foster, who wrote: 'You'll remember where you were when you first 
felt it, how you were stuck to one spot like a small animal considering 
its end.

'The Jennifer Lawrence Stare. It cuts a searing swath in your 
gut. A reckoning. I remember going to the cutting rooms of Winter's 
Bone. I thought, Sure, this girl can act. But, man, this girl can also 
just be.'

Time magazine's managing editor Rick Stengel: 'This year we are trying something new: 
seven cover portraits of Time 100 honorees who reflect the breadth and 
depth of our list, each one profiled inside—as is our tradition—by an 
equally luminary voice.

'We commissioned the renowned photographer Mark 
Seliger to create the covers.

'The shoots took him and his crew to Los 
Angeles, Miami, New York City, Washington and Birmingham, England, where
 he took the first formal portrait of Malala since she survived a 
vicious attack by the Taliban last October.'
