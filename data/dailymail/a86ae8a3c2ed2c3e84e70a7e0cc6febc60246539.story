Euan Blair will marry his girlfriend of eight years Suzanne Ashman on September 14 at his parents' mansion in the Buckinghamshire countryside, it emerged today.

Euan, 29, and Suzanne, 25, who were introduced by former defence secretary Geoff Hoon, will have an autumn wedding at South Pavilion, the Grade I-listed house in Wotton Underwood bought by the Blairs for £4m in 2008.

The former Prime Minister and his wife Cherie are understood to be planning a spectacular party for the couple, who bought a house together in Islington at the end of last year and got engaged over Christmas.

Euan Blair, 29, is to marry his long-term girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25, in Buckinghamshire in September

Euan, who graduated from the University of Bristol with a 2:1 in history, worked as an intern at the House of Representatives in the U.S. before joining the American merchant bank Morgan Stanley.

Last year he quit his job and became a business development manager at the Coventry-based Sarina Russo Job Access, part of the government's Work Programme, in a move said by some to be a stepping stone towards following his father into politics.

Some believe his job in the Midlands is a shrewd move which would boost his chances, should he try, of winning the Labour seat of Coventry North West, from which current MP Geoffrey Robinson may retire in 2015.

Privately-educated Miss Ashman read PPE at Trinity College, Oxford, after leaving St Paul's Girls' School in London.  She did work experience with Mr Hoon, during which she met Euan, and went on to work for Tony Blair's Faith Foundation.

Miss Ashman, who is now an analyst for Social Finance, which helps raise funds from private investors for good causes, gets on well with her future in-laws and has been on several holidays with them over the years.

Unlike Euan's, Miss Ashman's parents are divorced.  Her wealthy motor racing entrepreneur father John Ashman has married weathergirl (and former fiancee of Lembit Opik) Sian Lloyd, and her mother is the daughter of a former Turkish government minister and one-time mayor of Ankara.

Euan is the eldest of the Blairs' four children, and the first of them to marry, but whether it will be a Roman Catholic wedding remains to be seen.

Euan, like his younger brother Nicky, 27, was brought up Catholic and attended the popular Catholic Oratory school in west London before going to Bristol.  His mother is a Catholic, and his father joined the Catholic Church in 2007.

Whatever the style of the wedding, the Blairs (whose fortune runs to some £60m) are expected to throw a good party.

In 2000, a then 16-year-old Euan was picked up by police after being found drunk and incapable in Leicester Square.

Mrs Blair's colourful family are expected to be invited, including her Muslim convert sister Lauren, but there is doubt as to whether their frail father, actor Tony Booth, will be well enough to attend.
