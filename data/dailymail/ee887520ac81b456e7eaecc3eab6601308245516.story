He's not known for being fond of photographers but it seems Prince Harry does at least know his way around a camera - as the photos taken by the royal during a  trip to Lesotho last week reveal.

Among the touching shots taken by the 30-year-old is a black and white photo of a group of herd boys who attend a school run by his African charity Sentebale - all of whom happily strike a  pose for his camera.

Another portrait, which was taken by the prince on a £729 Fuji X100 camera, shows another of the herd boys being educated by the charity staring silently into the lens, his face framed by a traditional straw hat.

The photos were taken during a flying visit to Lesotho last week, which was undertaken on behalf of Harry's charity Sentebale. During the trip, he visited a number of projects being run by the charity, including the herd boy night school where the pictures were snapped.

Speaking about his passion for photography, Harry said: 'I have always enjoyed photography and the challenges that come with trying to capture the perfect shot, although privately I don't take many photos. The best photos I have are in my head - I have some very special memories, mostly from Africa.'

'These photos have been taken on a really good camera, the Fuji X100,' commented MailOnline picture editor, Paul Ashton. ' Prince Harry has made the most of the available light and his pictures are perfectly exposed.

'The shots of the children look particularly fun - they’re obviously very relaxed in his company.'

But the trip wasn't just about launching Harry's photography career. Ever the action man, the prince also got involved with construction at Sentebale's new Mahomato Children's Centre in Thaba-Bosiu.

He also spent time meeting some of the orphaned children living at the Phelisanong and Mants'ase Children's Homes, both of which are being run with help from Sentebale.

Touching photos, not taken by Harry this time, show him playing with an adorable three-year-old blind girl named Karabo who giggled madly as he swung her into the air.

Another little boy named Lerato also got a lift from the playful prince, who looked happy and relaxed as he played with the children.

Fun though it might have been, the visit had a serious purpose with Harry, who last month took part in a  polo match on behalf of Sentebale during a trip to Abu Dhabi, telling of the impact the charity's work is having in a country which has the world's second highest HIV infection rate and where one in three children are orphans.

'These are children who have never had the chance to talk about their illness, and who had no idea that they were one of so many in their age group,' he said.

'It was really emotional watching them interact with each other. Some really outgoing chatty kids, others slightly overwhelmed, but all with huge smiles. This confirmed to me again that what we’re doing is going to change thousands of children’s lives, and hopefully save a generation.'

Prince Harry arrived in the country on a private visit on the 5th December and returned to the UK last Wednesday, having documented much of the short trip himself.

Travelling with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, with whom he co-founded the charity in 2006, the prince visited a number of Sentebale's community partners, among them the Thuso Centre for children with disabilities, where he took part in a cooking lesson.

Education: The herd boy school is open at night and provides education to children who spend their days working on the land

Learning: This boy is one of many who are asked to spend their days tending their parents' herds rather than attending lessons

The main focus of the trip was, however, to see the progress being made on the new  Mamohato Children's Centre, which, say the charity, is set to increase four-fold the number of vulnerable children helped by the charity.

Once complete, the residential centre will be used to host week-long camps for children living with HIV, which will include workshops aimed at helping them overcome the stigma attached to the illness and allow them to access psycho-social support. 

Speaking after the visit, Cathy Ferrier, CEO of Sentebale said: 'This visit was a great opportunity for Prince Harry to revisit Sentebale’s work in country, meet the children and see the positive impact of our programmes.

'He also had a chance to put his personal input to the next phase of the building of the Mamohato Children's Centre. All the team at Sentebale are excited to see the plans for the new children's centre coming to life and are looking forward to the opening in 2015. We can't wait!' 

Action man: Harry visited the site of the new Mahomato Children's Centre in Thaba-Bosiu and helped out with the sandstone cladding

Going well: Harry looked impressed with the progress at the new Mahomato Children's Centre in Thaba-Bosiu

Good stuff: The centre will provide space for week-long residential courses aimed at boosting children's confidence

Important: Those who will benefit are youngsters with HIV/AIDS. They will also be given psycho-social support

Big plans: Harry met architect Luke Bennett in London before travelling to Lesotho to see the progress on building the new orphanage
