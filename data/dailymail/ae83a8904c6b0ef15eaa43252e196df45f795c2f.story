Ukip is planning to fight for 100 seats at the next election, with a third of voters saying they are prepared to back Nigel Farage.

Paul Sykes, the party’s biggest donor, revealed he is ready to write a cheque for £1.5million to bankroll the ambitious push.

As Tory divisions deepen over how to respond to the Eurosceptic threat, a new poll put Ukip on 18 per cent, with one in three people willing to back the party if they thought they could win in their local area.

Almost a third of people say they would be willing to support Ukip if they thought Mr Farage's party could win in the constituency where they live

Mr Farage has overseen an extraordinary surge in popularity since Ukip won the European elections in May.

In August, Douglas Carswell became the first Tory MP to defect to Ukip, and weeks later Mark Reckless followed him.

The Rochester and Strood by-election triggered by Mr Reckless’ decision to quit is seen as a crucial test of the Tory ability to halt the Ukip bandwagon.

But two polls have now put Ukip ahead by as many as 13 points, leading party strategists to reconsider their tactics for the general election.

Mr Farage had suggested the party would aim for around 25 to 30 MPs in May 2015.

But Mr Sykes told the Sunday Times: ‘Our finances are now rebuilding again after the European election victory, but we will be raising significant further funds for a national campaign and a strong push to target marginal seats, probably nearer 100 than the 30-40 we originally identified.’

Mr Sykes, a multi-millionaire, bankrolled a series of hard-hitting campaign posters in the run-up to May's Euro elections.

Labour and the Conservatives are neck and neck on 33 per cent, according to the latest Opinium poll, with Ukip on 18 per cent and the Lib Dems languishing on just 6 per cent

He revealed there would be no limit on the ambitions of the Ukip push for seats.

‘You’re going to be able to see this campaign from the moon.

‘Ukip is not going to lose the campaign because we don’t have enough adverts.’

A new Opinium poll for the Observer puts Ukip on 18 per cent, well ahead of the Lib Dems who have slumped to just 6 per cent. The Tories and Labour are tied on 33 per cent.

However, the poll also shows that many more people would be willing to vote Ukip if they thought they stood a chance of securing an MP.

Some 31 per cent say they would back Mr Farage’s party if they thought they could win in the constituency they live in.

Almost half (49 per cent) disagree, while 18 per cent neither agree nor disagree. 

The Conservatives are still grappling with how to respond to the Ukip threat, with differing views about whether pandering to them will lose votes on the centre ground.

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon insisted only a Conservative government could give opponents of the EU here referendum which would end Britain's membership

Defence Secretary Michael Fallon today pleaded with even voters who want to leave the European Union to stay with the Tories.

He told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'If you want change in Europe, if you want a referendum on Europe, if you are against Europe and want to leave, the only party that will give yu that vote is the Conservatives.'

Pressed on whether the Tories will lose in Rochester, Mr Fallon insisted: 'We are not planning to fail there.'

He said voters understand that 'Ukip cannot actually deliver with one MP or two MPs, they are not a party that can deliver a government'.

Former immigration minister Damian Green warned against calls for the Tories to do a deal with Ukip.

He told the BBC: 'Whatever happens, it would be a complete disaster for the Tory party to become ‘Ukip-light’, or to do a pact with Ukip. 

'There is a myth that some people foster, that you can simply add the current Ukip vote to the current Conservative vote, and produce a majority. 

'Because, of course, if the Conservative party tries to turn itself into something like Ukip, tries to sound like Ukip, tries to adopt Ukip policies, it will haemorrhage voters in other parts of the political spectrum.'
