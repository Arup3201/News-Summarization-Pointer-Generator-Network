Police continue to look for a possible motive in the shooting death of Gretchen Crooks, allegedly by her 13-year-old son Noah.

Police responding to the Crooks home, in Osage, Iowa, on Saturday night, found the woman shot 
multiple times after her teenage son - the alleged shooter - called 911.

'We're at a loss. These are good people,' sheriff Curt Younker said.

There was no history of domestic abuse or criminal records associated with any Crooks family members.

The 13-year-old boy who allegedly 
shot his 37-year-old mother dead with a hunting rifle is also facing 
'unheard of' charges that he tried to sexually abuse her.

Now, authorities are saying Noah 
Crooks also tried to sexually abuse his mother, which mental health 
professionals say they have never encountered among juveniles.

Charges filed today in Mitchell County District Court further accuse 
Noah Crooks, an eighth-grader at Osage Middle School, of assault with 
attempt to commit sexual abuse against his mother.

Shelia Aukes, a licensed social worker
 in Des Moines who works with young people on a variety of mental health
 issues told the DesMoines Register: 'The victims in most sex offenses 
committed by juveniles are siblings, 
other juveniles or, more rare, other adults.

'A child or adolescent 
sexually abusing a parent is completely out of the norm, totally unheard
 of.'

Weapon: A motive for the shooting has yet to be reported while the victim's husband, pictured, had a penchant for guns according to his Facebook page

Crooks is believed to have fired a .22
 calibre at his mother on Saturday at their rural home and four days 
later a motive has yet to be established.

The teen was said to be calm and emotionless when he called 911 reporting the shooting.

'The emotions of the young man, from 
what I've been told, is his demeanour was very calm and kind of stoic. 
Almost like he was in shock also,' Deputy Greg Beaver told KTTC.

He is currently being held at the North Iowa Juvenile Detention Center in Waterloo and charges are expected to be filed today. He will be tried as a juvenile.

Iowa law allows children ages 14 and older to face crimes in adult court.

Mitchell County Sheriff Curt Younker told the DesMoines Register: 'We’re at a loss. These are good people, very responsible. It is the most heartbreaking thing I’ve ever seen.'

Home: Police reported the teenager as sounding calm on the phone though perhaps in shock by what had just happened

'We have lost our daughter. We have lost
 our grandson,' Mrs Crooks' mother Beverly Brahm of Mason City told the 
Albert Lea Tribune.

Mrs Crooks, who was listed with her husband William Crooks as the rural Osage property owners, had worked as a nurse at Mercy Medical Center-North Iowa while also studying toward her master's degree after accepted at the University of Iowa in 2009.

On her Facebook page back in 2010, she praised her son, one of two sons according to Mrs Brahm, for his musical talents on the saxophone as well as his accomplishment in being accepted into a University of Iowa camp to learn Chinese.

'So proud of him!' she wrote.

She had also recently published an application on her page reading: 'Click "like" if you love your son!'

Mrs Crooks' death comes as the first reported murder in the city of Osage since 1898, according to KAAL-TV.

Praise: The mother had praised her son on her Facebook page for his acceptance into a Chinese language camp at the University of Iowa as well as his playing of the saxophone

Arrest: The 13-year-old was taken into custody without incident and taken to the North Iowa Juvenile Detention Center where charges have not yet been filed

The
 Mitchell County Sheriff's Office says their investigation is ongoing 
with few further details in the killing reported such as where the 
weapon came from.

William
 Crooks' Facebook page shows his interest in the US Concealed Carry 
association as well as the Springfield Armory, a company that sells 
pistols and rifles.

The
 State Medical Examiner’s Office as well as the Iowa Division of 
Criminal Investigation are continuing their investigation as well.

Her family expressed their great sadness by her death while her 35-year-old brother Jason thanked friends and family for their support.

'I just want to extend my gratitude to family and friends for their support during this time,' he told the WCF Courier.

Her co-workers at Mercy Medical also released a statement obtained by the Courier, reading:

Nurse: Mrs Crooks worked as a nurse at Mercy Medical Center-North Iowa while also studying toward her master's degree at the University of Iowa

Grade school: The boy's school of Osage Middle School says they're contacting students' families and offering counseling

'Gretchen was a great nurse and leader. We, as members of her Mercy 
family, continue to mourn for her and will be holding a memorial 
service. Our hearts and prayers go out to her family and friends.'

Speaking of her daughter with pride, Mrs Brahm, whom she relishes knowing she was able to say 'I love you' to earlier in the day of her passing, described the 37-year-old as studying 'full time, while she was working full time,' according to the Courier.

Wanting to make a difference wherever she could, Mrs Crooks previously served among a team of doctors and nurses who travelled to provide medical relief to the Hurricane Katrina and Rita victims in the Gulf in 2005.

Serving as a critical care nurse, she cared for patients in a makeshift hospital.

Her son, an eighth grader at Osage Middle School, the boy's school's superintendent told ABC 6 that they have since begun reaching out to the other students' homes while also offering counseling.

'It's gut-wrenching, you know?' Osage Superintendent Steve Bass told ABC. 'It's always tough in a small community when anyone dies for any reason but then you hear that a student is involved in any shape or form, it kind of goes to another level.'
