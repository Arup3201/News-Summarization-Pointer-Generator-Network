A viagogo spokesperson commented: 'Brits have been spoiled for choice when it comes to both homegrown and global sports in recent years. 2014 was another vintage year, whether you were one of the 80,000 fight fans watching Froch knock out Groves, or you were experiencing the spectacle of NFL in London.

'Our data also shows that people are buying more tickets to watch sports abroad, whether they're travelling to see a specific event, or snapping up last minute tickets to catch a game while they're in town on business or on holiday.'
