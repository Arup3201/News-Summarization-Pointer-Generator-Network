It took a year for Hillsong leader Brian Houston to meet with the Pentecostal church about allegations his father had molested a seven-year-old boy.

The meeting came 12 months after Pastor Barbara Taylor had raised with state executives of the Assemblies of God the matter of Frank Houston's abuse of the boy in Sydney almost 30 years earlier.

It took place at the Qantas Club at Sydney Airport three days before Christmas 1999 and was called by Hillsong pastor Brian Houston who also informed church leaders he had stood his father down, an inquiry has heard on Wednesday.

At the time, Brian was national president of the Assemblies of God - a confederation of about 1000 evangelical churches.

Keith Ainge, former national secretary of AoG in Australia, has told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse Brian Houston reported at the meeting his father had admitted to a sexual act with a minor.

Pastor Ainge said he and the others 'knew nothing of the complaints against Frank Houston' until the December 1999 meeting.

The meeting upheld Brian Houston's decision, and agreed that Frank Houston be suspended from ministry for 12 months and be invited to enter a restorative program.

Pastor Ainge said there was not a great deal of information about the complaint except that there was 'one incident' with a minor.

Earlier on Wednesday, Pastor Taylor - who is head of a small church in Mount Druitt - said she became concerned AHA was still not getting the counselling he needed and wrote to Brian Houston in June 2000 that people were reporting to her Frank Houston was still preaching.

Brian Houston rang her and 'was very angry', she said.

Pastor Taylor kept notes from the time and in those she recorded that Brian Houston told her his father was very depressed.

He also told her a meeting had taken place between AHA, his father, and an elder of his father's church.

AHA has told the commission Frank Houston asked for forgiveness and offered him $10,000 during a meeting at a McDonald's in Thornleigh.

He was given a 'food-stained napkin' to sign, AHA said.

Pastor Taylor said she thought Brian Houston was angry because 'he had dealt with it'.

She also said as a 'village pastor' she was not kept in the loop by the executive.

In reply to questions from Mark Higgins, counsel representing Hillsong Church Ltd, she said Brian Houston had asked her that any future contact be by phone, 'because the staff opened his mail'.

The inquiry heard Brian Houston had told church leaders in a meeting that Frank Houston had admitted he had engaged in a sexual act with a minor

Outside the hearing, Brian Houston said he welcomed the royal commission process.

He reiterated an earlier statement in which he said the pain to him of his father being engaged 'in such horrific acts' was nothing compared with the pain of the victims.

He said Hillsong was resilient and there were no allegations against him or the church.

The hearing resumes on Thursday when Keith Ainge continues giving evidence.

Brian Houston is also expected to give evidence.

On Tuesday, AHA told the commission Frank Houston would stay with his family when he came to Sydney from New Zealand in the 1970s.

AHA was seven when Frank Houston would come to his room, lie on him, fondle him and masturbate him, the alleged victim told the commission.

'I would wake up petrified and I would stay very still,' he said.

He said the abuse left him feeling ashamed, and he now suffered depression.

AHA said his family was very involved in the church, and when he eventually told his mother in 1978 she told him he did not 'want to be responsible for turning people from the church and sending them to hell'.

He said the Houstons 'were considered to be almost like royalty' in the circles in which his parents moved.

The witness said when, in 1998, his mother told another church pastor of the abuse, Frank Houston apologised.

He was told if there were any problems to contact Frank or Brian Houston.

He said after two months he rang Brian and said: 'What is happening with the money I was promised? I agreed to forgive your father.'

AHA said Brian Houston said 'Yes, OK, I'll get the money for you. There's no problem. You know it's your fault all of this happened. You tempted my father'.

AHA said he replied: 'Why, did he molest you also?' He said Brian got very angry after that.

'He slammed the phone down with words to the effect "You'll be getting money".'

While acknowledging AHA's courage in appearing at the commission, Brian Houston rejected the claims that he accused him of tempting his father.

'I disagree with his perception of the phone call with me and I strongly refute that I - at any time - accused him of tempting my father. I would never say this and I do not believe this,' he said in a statement made outside the commission.

'At no stage did I attempt to hide or cover up the allegations against my father.
