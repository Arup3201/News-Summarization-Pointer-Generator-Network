A self-titled 'remover of impurities' and 'faith healer' has managed to swindle $130,000 cash from two female strangers by convincing them they had evil inside of them that needed to be exorcized.

Known to his victims as 'Dorian' and 'Robert' but booked into jail as Joe Alvarez, 32, police say the so-called 'chakra aligner' lives under several aliases and that they are still yet to confirm his identity.

Alvarez, who was arrested at a Fort Lauderdale Beach apartment the day people Thanksgiving, preyed on both women at the Aventura Mall in Miami, striking up a friendship separately with each before starting his spiel about being a spiritual leader and how he could cleanse them.

Police have described as 'impressive' Alvarez's ability to pick his targets based on their spiritual inclinations.

Accused: Living under several aliases and social security numbers, the man police are calling Joe Alvarez, 32, allegedly fleeced over $130,000 cash from two women he met at a Miami mall after convincing them they had evil inside them that he could exorcize

Victim: Cassandre Soray, seen here in a Facebook photo, said she was preyed upon by Joe Alvarez and fleeced of tens of thousands of dollars

'I was very upset for being so naive and gullible,' one of the women, Evelyn Taveras, 36, told The Sun Sentinel.

Taveras crossed paths with Alvarez on Feb. 6 as she entered a store he was leaving.

He complimented her 'beautiful aura' and its 'yellow hue'.

'It's just the way he came across, very humble, understanding, just a very familiar feeling,' Taveras said.

'Recently I had been becoming more religious and spiritual with energy work, positive thinking and auras â€¦ and it struck me as odd that he could see that.'

Promising to expel bad luck and be rid her of harmful spiritual impurities, Alvarez first sold Taveras three crystals for $5,200 each, saying 'they were essential for her to maintain a good aura'.

Taveras mistakenly told Alvarez she had $39,000 cash hidden under her mattress at home, which she was saving to start a business.

Because he had multiple aliases, police initially struggled to track down the man booked as 'Joe Alvarez'. They had images of him from Aventura Mall security cameras (pictured) but it wasn't until he made a booking for some pamphlets to be printed that authorities were able to pounce

On May 5, Alvarez showed up at the house unannounced for a visit, telling Taveras not to touch money because she would curse it with bad luck.

She ignored the warning and, when she went to inspect the hiding spot, found play money and newspaper clippings in its place.

A police report said she was also relieved of of $48,700 worth of jewelery.

The second woman, Cassandre Soray, 36, of Miami Shores, told police she was targeted in almost the exact same way..

Soray met Alvarez in December 2012 at Aventura Mall, where he introduced himself as Robert.

Over the course of a few months, 'Robert' persuaded Soray to pay him $37,000 'to cleanse the impurities from her', a police report said.

Another part to Alvarez's shtick was setting fire to bundles of cash that he had convinced the women to withdraw as part of the cleansing process.

However the bin being used as the fire was full of fake money and Alvarez had kept the real notes.

Hallandale Beach police were able to track down Alvarez on Nov. 27 after he placed an order with a printing business for a 'spiritual healer' and 'astrological readings' and provided a Fort Lauderdale Beach address.

Joe Alvarez is now facing two counts of grand theft and two counts of obtaining property by gaming, according to online jail records

'The defendant in this case has used multiple identities, dates of birth and Social Security numbers,' police reports said.

'The defendant has no known state photo identification, and his true name has not been confirmed.'

Also known as Robert Johnson, Dorian Johnson, Robert Dorian, Joey Alvarez and Bob Johnson, he's now being held in a Pompano Beach jail on $16,000 bond.

He faces two counts of grand theft and two counts of obtaining property by gaming, online jail records said.

'His ability to get into them and know that they are into spirituality and to use that as an access into their personal life is impressive,' Hallandale Beach Polic Det. Edward McGovern told NBC 6.
