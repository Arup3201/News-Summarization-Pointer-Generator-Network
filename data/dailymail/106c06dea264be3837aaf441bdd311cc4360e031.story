It may not be streamlined enough to  nip through traffic, but this solar-powered electric bike will at least make hills easier to climb.

A Dutch inventor came up with the the Maxun One so he could ride through the mountains effortlessly, and his bike travels at speeds of 14mph (22km/h) without a battery.

It features large solar panels in front and behind the saddle and these are used to charge the bike as its being used.

The Maxun One (pictured) was designed by Dutch engineer Albert van Dalen. It features solar panels in front of, and behind, the saddle that measure 1.6ft (0.5 metres) each, and these are used to constantly charge the bike as its being ridden

Each of the panels measures 1.6ft (0.5 metres).

In theory, because they are constantly charging, it means the bike never runs out of energy, and Mr van Dalen claims to have clocked more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) in the past three months

The 56-year-old software engineer from Maastricht in the Netherlands said: ‘I used to have a motorcycle that I made trips through Belgium's Ardennes mountains on.

‘I decided I wanted to do the same with an electric bike - cycling with a normal bicycle is too exhausting in that kind of terrain.'

Each of the panels measures 1.6ft (0.5 metres). In theory, because they panels are constantly charging, it means the bike never runs out of energy, and Mr van Dalen (picutred) claims to have clocked more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) in the past three months

The handmade bike (pictured) has been patented and only 50 of the bikes will be built and sold, for £80,000 ($126,000) each. Mr van Dalen experimented with different sized panels before settling on ones large enough to provide enough energy, but small enough to ride in traffic

He admitted that he finds traditional electric bikes ugly, and began wondering if it would be possible to cycle entirely on solar energy.

‘Some solar bikes were available, but they all used a large trailer for the solar panels and I wanted my bike to be handy in traffic and effortless to ride, even in the absence of sun,' continued Mr van Dalen.

A German designer recently unveiled an electric bike made entirely from wood. 

The so-called 'ebike' was built by Matthias Broda, and has a rechargeable motor that helps with pedalling. 

The development team, which included students from the University for Sustainable Development Eberswalde, now has a working prototype together which it is testing in Berlin.

The designers said they set out to make a new vehicle which would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of more traditional, metal bikes.

But the wooden vehicle comes with a price tag of £3,000 ($4,730). 

‘I imagined how great it would be to cycle just on solar energy without pedalling - just like sailing in the wind.

‘People in my field all said that a bicycle on solar energy was not possible but that didn't put me off, in fact it encouraged me to develop the solar bike. 

The handmade bike has been patented and will be tested to enter the Guinness World Records next summer. 

Only 50 of the bikes will be built and sold, for £80,000 ($126,000) each.

Mr van Dalen taught himself about carbon composites and solar cells since starting the project in 2010.

He experimented with different sized solar panels until settling on some large enough to provide enough energy, but small enough to ride in traffic.

Without pedalling or using the battery, the sun delivers the energy for a speed that averages 14mph (20km/h) but can go faster.

‘This shows how powerful the sun is,’ continued Mr van Dalen. ‘The solar panels may seem large at first glance, but the Maxun One is easy to handle in traffic and the solar panels perform particularly well, even on semi-cloudy days.’

‘I always watch out when the weather is sunny so I can ride my solar bike again.

‘I do find it funny when Japanese people pass by, they say: here they already have solar bikes, which we have not got back home yet.’
