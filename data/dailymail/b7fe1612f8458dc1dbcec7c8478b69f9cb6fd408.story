The operation was masterminded by accountant Paula White, an ex-director of Chester City

A former football club director set up a £3.6million operation that sold designer drugs online after they lost their status as ‘legal highs’ when they were banned, a court was told.

The operation masterminded by accountant Paula White, an ex-director of Chester City, sold drugs with names such as Jolly Blue Pearls and Heaven via websites describing the products as being ‘like cocaine, ketamine or amphetamine’, a jury heard.

Bolton Crown Court was told that White, 44, who was arrested at her £800,000 home in Salford after a surveillance operation, had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply class-B drugs between 2010 and 2013.

Six other people yesterday denied being involved in the operation, which allegedly exported drugs from a mill near Bolton that they referred to as Area 51, after the top-secret US Air Force base in Nevada rumoured to house research on UFOs.

Prosecutor Francis McEntee said it was ‘a sophisticated and highly profitable operation that has taken drug dealing off street corners and put it on the internet’, dispatching 200 parcels a day to users as far afield as Australia.

He told the court that in April 2010, some of the drugs were made illegal but the group continued selling them.

They were offered for ‘research’ but sold under categories such as ‘mood elevator’, meaning the group ‘knew the nature of what they were selling’.

The trial continues. White will be sentenced later.
