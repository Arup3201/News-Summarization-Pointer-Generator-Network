 It was the first foreign Soviet nuclear base, built in Germany three years before the Cuban missile crises and ready for an attack on Western Europe.

Soviet nuclear missiles 20 times more powerful than Hiroshima were set 
up here, primed to be fired at targets including London and nuclear 
bases in eastern England.

But since it was built in 1959 in the picturesque woods of Brandenburg, Vogelsang has become an eerie ghost town, reclaimed by nature.

Ready for attack: Bunkers covered in sand for missiles and hardened concrete bunkers for warheads lay in the camp

Primed: A rocket launcher able to fire at targets up to 1,200km (750 miles) away was also on site

Reclaimed: The base has been largely overtaken by nature

There was once a garrison town for 15,000 people in this wood in what was then East Germany, with a theatre, shops, offices, a gym and a school.

But the camp was extremely well hidden, concealed from spy planes and prying eyes by birch trees.

An obelisk which bares the silhouette of Lenin still stands and peeling murals featuring brightly coloured paintings of swans flying and a sailing ship remain at the school.

The upright figure of Lenin, and a mural of Red Army tanks in action, are also featured on the wall outside.

Bunkers covered in sand for missiles and hardened concrete bunkers for warheads lie elsewhere on the camp, once ready for attack.

An area which was once the site where weapons of mass destruction would have been launched, is now nothing more than a beautiful clearing amidst the trees. 

This idyllic glade features a concrete platform, on which there is a metal plate for the rocket 
launcher able to fire at targets up to 1,200km (750 
miles) away, and which could have easily reached London, which lies just 1,000km away. 

It is almost impossible to see the sky from the glade, which means it would also have been barely visible to the prying spy planes of the 1960s. 

According to secret American intelligence reports released since the end of the Cold War, the base was set up in 1959, the BBC reports.

In Cuba, aerial photographs used as evidence were clear and after two weeks of tension, the Soviet Union backed down and agreed to remove the weapons. 

But the rocket base in Germany was far less visible.

Secret CIA reports dated  August 11, 1960, and entitled 'Possible Shyster Missile Base in East Germany'  piece together the puzzle of where the base could be.

Eerie reminder: Brightly coloured murals featuring swans and ships remain on the walls of the camp's school

Abandoned: The camp was left in 1994 when the Red Army removed anything that they could from the base

First foreign base: The camp was designed to target the west

The Americans knew there was a new missile and trailer system in use because it had been shown to the Politburo and cameras on May Day in 1957 and 1960.

They also knew the Soviet Union was too distant for it to reach prime Western targets.

Details which appear to have come from Western agents in East Germany who observed what was going on around them on the railways and roads between Poland and East Germany helped to piece together the puzzle. 

CIA reports reveal that agents had seen 'a very slow moving column of Soviet military vehicles'  heading from the 'direction in which the Jueterbog-Damm airfield and a railroad loading ramp are located in a northwesterly direction along the western outskirts of Jueterbog.'

A few months later, another observation noted: 'A group of eight trailers probably identical to the Shyster parade trailer, based on analysis of available photography, was observed entering East Germany by rail at Frankfurt-Oder, on 9 September, 1959.'

Special military train shipments, suspected of carrying unidentified Soviet missiles and related equipment were also seen at several other locations in East Germany during 1959.

From all of the clues, the CIA concluded the camp in the forest north of Berlin was going to be used for mobile launchers of nuclear weapons.

Hidden: A bunker at the base concealed by mountains of sand

Overgrown: Although the buildings, including shops, a school and a theatre still remain, they are gradually being overtaken by nature

A later CIA account told a story of the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, asking a military designer how many nuclear missiles it would take to destroy Britain and France. 

Those missiles would have been fired from this camp. 

The missiles deployed in East Germany in spring 1959, were withdrawn later in the year.

However, unaware, the CIA, was still concerned about their presence in the country in early 1961.

Loughborough University's Dr Paul Maddrell, an expert on Western intelligence operations in East Germany, told the BBC Khrushchev deployed the weapons as part of a policy of 'nuclear blackmail.'

He said: 'He threatened in 1956, at the time of the Suez Crisis, to use nuclear weapons, and he very much regarded his threat as successful, so he saw nuclear blackmail as a valuable policy initiative and he needed, therefore, the nuclear missiles to back that up.'

According to secret American intelligence reports, the base was set up in 1959

Maddrell said he believed they were withdrawn in connection with Khrushchev's demand in November 1958 that Western countries should leave West Berlin.

As Nato announced plans to defend West Berlin and to cross East German territory the threat of a full-scale war looked imminent.

For years after Vogelsang was the headquarters of the Soviet Union's 25th Tank Division, the third biggest Soviet military base in East Germany.
