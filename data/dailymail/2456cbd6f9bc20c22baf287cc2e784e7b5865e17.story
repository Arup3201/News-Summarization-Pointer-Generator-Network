Butt-sted: A DNA sample from a discarded cigarette led the police to solve the 14-year-old crime

A man has been convicted of a violent rape committed 14 years ago after police found his DNA on a cigarette.

Lerio Guerrero, 34, pleaded guilty to the rape and robbery of a 28-year-old college professor in the Lower East Village, Manhattan in 1998 after police linked him to the crime over a decade later.

The cigarette was found whilst police investigated the scene of another sexual assault in 2011 where they encountered Mr Guerrero.

After arresting him for trespassing and possession of a knife, they took DNA from the cigarette â€“ and discovered a match with the 1998 case.

According to reports, Mr Guerrero had nothing to do with the 2011 case and was merely trying to get a closer look at the crime scene.

In November 1998, Leiro Guerrero, of Staten Island, attacked the college professor as she entered her New York apartment building.

After pushing in through the door, he raped her before robbing her.

When he found the contents of her wallet unsatisfying, Mr Guerrero held a piece of broken glass against her neck and forced her to take him to an ATM, where she emptied her account.

She managed to retrieve $800 but, still unhappy, Mr Guerrero dragged her to a second cash machine. She was able to break free and seek help.

Police say DNA was recovered from blood found on the victim's jacket, left there when her assailant cut himself on the shard of glass he was using as a weapon. At the time, no-one was convicted of the attack and the case went cold.

Caught: The NYPD were able to match the DNA found on the scene of a 2011 sexual assault to Mr Guerrero after which he admitted to the 1998 crime

Mr Guerrero was arrested several 
times over the following years, including a drink-driving conviction and
possession of marijuana. Each time, however, he was not linked to the 1998 case.

It was not until he trespassed at the 2011 rape scene and left behind the remains of his cigarette that New York 
Police could link him to the crime 13 years earlier.

Mr Guerrero was sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty which reduced the sentence from 25 years.

The case echoes a similar situation in Montgomery County, Maryland, where a DNA sample from a convicted serial rapist helped solve a 25-year-old case.

DNA obtained from a scene where a 20-year-old woman had been brutally raped in 1988 was matched to a sample in the national DNA database CODIS from William Joseph Trice.

In turn, this sample could be linked to two more cold case rapes of which Mr Trice had been convicted in 2008.
