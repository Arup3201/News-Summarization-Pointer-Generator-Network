With her glowing skin and yoga body, 45-year-old supermodel Christy Turlington is the walking picture of health.

So it comes as little surprise that the mother and maternal health advocate was snapped up by beauty supplement brand Imedeen to become its global ambassador.

In a behind the scenes video for her new campaign, Christy opens up about the ageing process, which so many women fear. Not Christy!

'There are no negatives about getting old. The older I get, the more comfortable in my skin I am, it's much more me,' she said.

Speaking about their selection of 
ambassador, the beauty supplement brand said: 'For us Christy is the 
true embodiment of what Imedeen represents.'

And right they are, as the yoga 
enthusiast showcases a wrinkle-free complexion in video footage released by 
the supplement, which promises to boost your complexion.

Lucky for some! Speaking about growing old, the 45-year-old said: 'There are no negatives about getting old. The older I get, the more comfortable in my skin I am, it's much more me'

Flawless: She swears by the philosophy that less is more and says that caring for her body from the inside is her priority - making her a perfect fit for the brand

Speaking
 about her skincare regime, Christy said: 'When I was younger as a model, I was working every day.

'More make-up, lights, and travel so my skin has probably suffered a bit from too much of everything.

'As I got older, I had time to start taking care of myself and my health and my skin really started to come into its own.

'I like the philosophy that less is more. Caring for my skin from the inside out is what I'm most interested in. What I put into my body is really important.'

The model maintains that her beauty regime consists of Imedeen, 'a bit of moisuriser' and 'a bit of concealer.'

The New York based model became a household name as the face of Calvin Klein from 1987 to 2007.

She has also worked with the likes of Maybelline and Versace and founded Every Mother Counts (EMC) in 2010 - a not-for-profit organisation whose goal is to end preventable deaths caused by pregnancy and childbirth around the world.

The organisation also encourages 
people to take action to improve health and well-being of girls and 
women worldwide. As part of the partnership, a donation will be made to 
EMC on behalf of the Imedeen brand to support Christy’s honourable work.

'Christy
 is a true professional and it’s been an amazing experience to be 
working with someone that exudes beauty, inside and out,' added the 
spokesperson.
