After an inspirational manager lead them to a fine finish at the World Cup but since left for Manchester United, these could be seen as challenging times for Holland.

But morale is still high in the squad under a new boss ahead of the friendly against Italy.

Here, Sportsmail looks at what the Dutch have to offer in life after Louis van Gaal. 

New era: Holland prepare for Thursday's friendly with Italy with Guus Hiddink at the helm

Tough act to follow: Louis van Gaal, now of Manchester United, lead the team to a third-place finish in Brazil

So, what's new?

Holland have turned to the steady hands of Guus Hiddink as they look to continue progressing with a talented group of players.

The vastly experienced boss has enjoyed a 27-year managerial career, including with national teams South Korea, Australia, Russia and Turkey.

He has even taken charge of the Oranje before, guiding the likes of Dennis Bergkamp and Frank de Boer to a World Cup quarter-final in 1998. Some believe they would have been deserving winners with their brand of football.

Hiddink rarely gets things wrong when it comes to coaching a side (he's often brought in when club side's face crisis) so it's no wonder he was picked for the job following a low-key spell at Anzhi Makhachkala.

He's not changing too much, either...

Happy to be here: Hiddink is preparing for his first match in charge of his second spell with the Oranje

How things have changed: Hiddink was the Dutch coach from 1994 to 1998

Who's in, who's out?

Out of the 23-man squad travelling, only six didn't go to the World Cup. Rafael van der Vaart was due to take part but has since picked up a knock (he was recalled after missing the trip to Brazil through injury), though Stoke's Erik Pieters has been brought back into the fold.

Jonathan de Guzman, now of Napoli, and Terence Kongolo are dropped from the set-up, as is Michel Vorm, but Ibrahim Affelay gets a chance to shine again.

Goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet, Ajax's Davy Klaassen, Gregory Van der Wiel ad Virgil van Dijk all win call-ups, but all in all Hiddink hasn't made any drastic changes in terms of personel, he has simply made changes due to injuries.

That doesn't mean he's sticking with Van Gaal's system, though...

Back in business: Gregory van der Wiel and Virgil van Dijk have been recalled

So, no more 3-5-2?

Why fix it when it's not broken? I hear you say. Van Gaal's system, deploying Dirk Kuyt as a free-roaming left wing-back worked wonderfully in Brazil, thrashing Spain in the group stages on the way to a third-place finish.

However, at times of desperation the new United boss did in fact change things, to 4-3-3 to be exact. And that's what Hiddink has opted for as he begins his reign.

'I had a discussion with the important players and we've decided to go back to 4-3-3. There was no surprise about it,' said Hiddink.

Arjen Robben is out of the game in Bari but the system would presumably mean a place out on the right-hand side for the winger. Memphis Depay, Jerome Lens or Kuyt will be the main candidates to partner Van Persie against Italy.

Target man: Van Persie will play the No 9 in the new 4-3-3 system, rather than with a partner in a 3-5-2

4-3-3 has been popular for Hiddink over the years. When appointed at Chelsea after Luiz Felipe Scolari's attempt at introducing Samba Style at Stamford Bridge, Guus kept things simple. Florent Malouda on one side, Nicholas Anelka on the other, Didier Drogba through the middle. It's safe to say it worked. Chelsea won 11 out of 13 Premier League games with the Dutchman at the helm.

Hiddink favoured 4-4-2 during his first spell with Holland and tried out a bizarre 3-6-1 with Australia in 2006, but there's no doubt 4-3-3 is his preferred method.

More conservative he may be, and you may not be getting the same Van Gaal fireworks, but the Dutch are on the right path for Euro 2016 and beyond.

Will it get the best out of the star men?

As mentioned above, Van Persie will surely be the lone striker in this system. Holland have used it in the past with the 30-year-old impressing, while he scored 31 Premier League goals as the main man at Arsenal.

Wesley Sneijder will still have the freedom to create in his No 10 role, and he should have quick wingers to provide through the flanks. In that sense the formation suits the Dutch perfectly.

However, one worry could be the defence. Despite the attacking talent, Holland have never really been blessed with world class players at the back, none more so than now.

Passion: Arjen Robben will operate from the right-hand side, though he is a doubt for the game on Thursday

Blow: Klaas jan Huntelaar will miss out in Bari, but would probably be second choice behind RVP

Ron Vlaar is a solid individual and had a superb World Cup with two centre halves supporting him, but doubts will remain about his suitability in this formation.

Daley Blind is another who had a fine tournament, though it is not yet clear whether he will operate best at left back, midfield or centre back in Hiddink's team. He played in all three positions in the World Cup.

Verdict?

It's hard to improve from a third-place finish in the World Cup, lead by Van Gaal, but Holland have hit the jackpot here.

Hiddink is the perfect man for this job with the same star players you associate wearing the orange shirt.

The mix of youth and experience should see this side kick on in the next few years.
