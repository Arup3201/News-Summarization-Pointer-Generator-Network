Suddenly, the title race is back on.

Events at the Stadium of Light and St Mary’s over the weekend were separated by 20 hours and 300 miles, but what they did was bring the Premier League protagonists closer together.

Chelsea were as good as champions last week, unbeaten in 12 and having dropped points just twice all season. There was, as is the norm these days, talk of bookmakers already settling bets on Jose Mourinho’s men claiming May’s crown – and this in November.

Autumn champions, yes, but as we welcome winter there was a chilly reminder for the Blues that resistance resides within the chasing pack.

Gus Poyet and Sunderland were the first team to record a clean sheet against the west Londoners during Saturday’s stalemate, thus providing the rest of the league with a blueprint of how to combat their offensive force.

Afterwards, Mourinho bemoaned the time afforded to opposite number Poyet to devise a strategy to shut out his side. ‘While they were in bed on Tuesday night we were getting back at 5am from Germany. They have had all week to work on their plan,’ he sounded.

But as Jose will know all too well, December offers little reprieve. Six matches are to be negotiated before the dawn of 2015. It is a mammoth month which can reshape the complexion of a title contest.

And, on the evidence of their 3-0 triumph at Southampton, champions Manchester City are in no mood to surrender their crown before the turkey has even been carved.

Indeed, come Christmas they could well be back on top of the tree. Six points now separate the Blues and City as we prepare to hurtle through the festive season.

Come the end of New Year’s Day both Chelsea and City would have contested 21 top-flight points – January’s table will tell us a lot about the destiny of this year’s trophy.

Before this weekend is out Chelsea will have faced Spurs and Newcastle, taking on the former without suspended talisman Diego Costa. He was part of the side which toiled at Sunderland, the Spaniard looking off the pace and out of sorts before picking up his fifth booking of the campaign. 

One match it may be, but perhaps a precedent has been set of how to foil Mourinho's men.

The likes of Hull, Stoke and West Ham – who they face over Christmas – will almost certainly adopt the gameplan which proved so effective on Wearside.

City, meanwhile, will look at their fixtures with a sense of anticipation. Four of the bottom seven – Leicester, Crystal Palace, West Brom and Burnley – could well represent the 12 points of Christmas for Manuel Pellegrini’s side. And, in Sergio Aguero, they boast the league’s best player.

His first task on Wednesday night is to succeed where Costa and Chelsea failed, and that is by penetrating Sunderland’s defiant defence.

But City, you feel, are gathering momentum. Three wins on the spin – including their come-from-behind triumph against Bayern Munich – has seen them hit top gear as we speed towards the festive frenzy.

Suddenly, the title race is back on.
