Nigel Pearson is set to escape punishment from the Football Association despite appearing to put his hands around the neck of Crystal Palace midfielder Jame McArthur.

The Leicester City boss was involved in an extraordinary clash with the Palace midfielder in the dying minutes of the Foxes' 1-0 home defeat on Saturday.

However, FA rules dictate that English football's governing body can only act upon the incident if it is mentioned in the referee's match report - but the official saw the incident and took no action at the time.

Therefore match referee Lee Mason, who came across to the touchline once fourth official Peter Bankes have calmed the situation down, is unlikely to include the incident in his match report - preventing the FA from taking any disciplinary action. 

Also, on Sports Lobster, McArthur himself played down the significance of the incident.

The Palace midfielder explained: 'Situation with me and Nigel Pearson is getting blown out of proportion.'

Pearson has already been given a one-match ban by the FA and a £10,000 fine this season for telling a supporter to 'f*** off and die'.

During his side's 3-1 defeat to Liverpool at the King Power Stadium at the beginning of December, Pearson was filmed shouting at the fan before being charged by the Football Association.

However, on Saturday, the Leicester City manager was accidentally upended as Leicester's Marc Albrighton and McArthur collided - leading to the incident on the touchline.

Pearson laughingly put his hands round McArthur’s throat then helped him to his feet but then refused to let go of his shirt.

‘He said something to me,’ revealed Pearson, who tried and failed to sign McArthur last summer.

‘I don't have to reveal anything do I. I think I'm more than capable of looking after myself.

‘Listen, I've got a lot of respect for lad, I think he's a good player.

'Clearly you know what happened in the summer with the possibility of him coming here.

‘I'm as disappointed as how he was with how things possibly panned.

‘But that's nothing to do with me or the player - it's the other football club which was involved in it who take absolute responsibility for anything that wasn't quite right.

‘And a certain manager who opened his trap when he should have kept his mouth shut. I have absolutely no problem today at all with the lad. I think he's a good player. He's a likeable lad, good for him.’
