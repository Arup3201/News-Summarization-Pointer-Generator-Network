James Milner wants to leave Manchester City, with Arsenal interested in landing the midfielder this summer.

The 28-year-old has grown tired of being overlooked in a central berth and has told Manuel Pellegrini he is seeking pastures new.

That news has alerted Arsene Wenger, who is hoping to add serious quality to his squad in a bid to launch a sustained tilt at the Premier League title.

On his way out? James Milner has told Manchester City that he wants to leave the club this summer

Make me an offer! Arsene Wenger is keen and is looking to bid upwards of £10m for the England international

Milner has forever been versatile but, as he draws towards the final third of his career, feels his future lies in the middle.

It is an area the Gunners are looking to strengthen, and they are planning an offer upwards of £10million, with Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool also keen.

The developments create a major issue for City, who are likely to lose the majority of their English players this summer.

On the one hand they risk keeping a player who wants to be elsewhere, but there is the niggling doubt that they will be able to fill the Champions League's homegrown quota.

Micah Richards, Jack Rodwell, Scott Sinclair, Gareth Barry and Joleon Lescott are all expected to depart the Etihad Stadium in the coming months.

It would leave goalkeeper Joe Hart as the club's only Englishman, although Gael Clichy and Dedryck Boyata also qualify.

Trouble? If Milner, and a number of others, depart then Joe Hart would be the club's only Englishman
