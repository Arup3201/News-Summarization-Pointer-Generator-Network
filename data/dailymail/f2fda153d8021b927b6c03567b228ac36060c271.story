An aerial assault has been launched on the mosquito population of Dallas for the first time in 45 years in a bid to combat the spread of deadly West Nile virus.

Aircraft loaded with insecticide have sprayed parts of the north east of Dallas County, after the virus killed 10 people and left at least 230 more ill.

Although commonplace in other major cities, the efforts have provoked a debate in the Dallas area between health officials trying to reduce the risk of disease and residents concerned about the dangers posed by the chemical cloud drifting down from above them.

'I cannot have any more deaths on my conscience because we did not take action,' Dallas mayor Mike Rawlings said.

Aerial
spraying is also being used elsewhere, including in neighborhoods in 
New York City and Sacramento, California, to combat the spread of West 
Nile virus.

Cases of West Nile Virus have also been reported in the Chicago area, with officials spraying the nearby town of Skokie with insecticide.

Two people have been taken ill with the virus in Skokie, while the Chicago suburb of Lake County has reported its first case.

Nearly half of all West Nile cases in
the United States so far this year are in Texas, however, according to 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If the trend continues, 2012 will be the worst West Nile year in the southern state's history.

The hot, dry weather has created ideal conditions for some species of mosquito.

The heat speeds up their life cycle, which accelerates the virus's replication process.

And during a drought, standing water can quickly turn stagnant when it's not flushed away by rain or runoff.

Ponds' protection: The arboretum had crews out working to cover about 8,000 square feet of ponds with tarps to protect the aquatic ecosystems from insecticide that will be sprayed over the city from aircraft

Both the mayor and Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins have declared a state of
emergency and voiced their support for the use of aircraft to battle the virus.

Yet even with the threat of 
infection, the spraying has sparked widespread opposition from people 
who fear the chemicals could be harmful.

Because of the severity of the outbreak, the Texas Health Department is stepping in to oversee the effort and to pay for it.

'This year is totally different from 
the experience Texas has had in the past,' state Health Commissioner Dr.
David Lakey said. 'If it's nuisance mosquitoes, we ask the city or 
county to pay part of that.

But in the midst of this disease outbreak, 
it's easier for us to go ahead and do it.'

A national spraying 
company called Clarke was set to deploy two to five Beechcraft King Air 
twin-engine planes for three hours of spraying.

Critics
have questioned whether the approach is scientifically proven to 
reduce West Nile cases.

But at least one study in California concluded 
that the odds of infection are about six times lower in treated areas 
than in those that are untreated.

Still, some residents fear the chemicals could harm their children, pets and useful insects such as honeybees and ladybugs.

Chemical released from the planes, synthetic pyrethroid, mimics a 
naturally occurring substance found in chrysanthemums.

The Environmental
Protection Agency has said that pyrethroids do not pose a significant 
risk to wildlife or the environment, though no pesticide is 100 percent 
safe.

About eight-tenths of an ounce of chemical is applied per acre.

The
insecticide's common name is Duet Dual-Action Adulticide.

West Nile Virus (WNV) is found in 
both temperate and tropical regions, having been first identified in the
West Nile region of Uganda in 1937.

It mainly infects birds and horses, and human infection is almost always transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito.

Symptoms include fever, headache, excessive sweating), weakness,  drowsiness and, pain in the joints. Stronger strains of the virus can inuce nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.

The most dangerous form can lead to unconsciousness, sometimes approaching near-coma, and death.

Up to 80 per cent of human infections do not show any symptoms.

WNV
emerged as a distinct virus around 1,000 years ago, developing into two
distinct forms. One has been transmitted in Africa and around the 
world, while the other has been confined to Africa - although it has been recently detected in horses Europe.

The label 
says it's toxic to fish and other types of aquatic life, and it contains
distilled petroleum.

Kelly Nash, 
who lives in Dallas and works for an environmental consulting firm, has questioned the move.

'One
ounce an acre doesn't sound like much, but we will spray at least 2,000
gallons all over the city,' Nash said.

'A 2,000-gallon oil spill would 
be significant.

'I'm concerned that we're breeding resistant mosquitoes 
that next time will have Dengue fever or something worse.'

Harris 
County, which includes humid, mosquito-filled Houston, has used aerial 
spraying once a year since 2002, the year the virus was first detected 
in Texas.

'We can't be everywhere at all 
times,' Mosquito Control Director Dr. Rudy Bueno said.

'Aerial treatment
is a way to supplement what we do on the ground.'

Most people 
infected with West Nile virus won't get sick, but about one in 150 
people will develop the severe form of the illness.

Symptoms include 
headache, high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors, 
convulsions, muscle weakness and paralysis.

Jordan Conner, 14, spent
eight days in intensive care with the most severe form of West Nile 
virus.

Her mother, Ebonie Conner of Arlington, said she doesn't approve 
of aerial spraying and wishes local leaders would do more to educate the
community.

'We've been desensitized to West Nile virus,' Mrs Conner 
said.

'It's been ingrained in us that it affects older people and 
infants.

'I think they need to pass out insect repellent, mention it in 
back-to-school drives.'
