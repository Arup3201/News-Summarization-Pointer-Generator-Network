Lena Dunham is pictured posing in a polka dot Burberry shirt for her very first Vogue cover.

The 27-year-old is hailed The New Queen of Comedy in the February issue, and sees her interview take place during the filming of season three, which premiered on Sunday.

But the fact that it is just a head-shot rather than a full-body image may raise questions about the U.S. glossy's attitude towards larger body shapes.

Regardless, Miss Dunham looks sensational on the Annie Leibovitz-shot cover. And an inside shot does pay tribute to the curves that she is so fiercely proud of.

In any case, it seems the star is very proud of the results, as she tweeted a link this morning with the words: 'Dear @voguemagazine: Thank you. Love, Lena.'

The interview sees Miss Dunham share insights into her rise to fame, her on-screen alter-ego's nudity, and her relationship with Fun's Jack Antonoff.

The couple were set up on a blind date by his sister, designer Rachel Antonoff, and admits falling for him came as something of a surprise.

'I’d been like, If I never date again
 in my whole life, I’ll be fine with it! I want to work and rescue 
rabbits and be a notable eccentric!' she said. 'I had a whole romantic 
idea about singledom, and then, of course, that’s the moment when you 
meet someone that you really care about.'

Miss Dunham also opens up about her attitude to fashion, which is far more sophisticated than her on-screen image as Hanna Horvath. In fact, she learned about style early on, as one of her babysitters was none other than the designer of her Golden Globes dress - Zac Posen. Mr Posen even made her high school graduation dress.

Of her other favorite designers, she continues: 'I’ve always loved Comme des Garçons; I’ve always loved Yohji Yamamoto. I’m into Charlotte Olympia flats. I really love a Prada bag because they always have one weird detail that you didn’t think about. I always wear J Brand jeans because the waist is high . . . a low-cut jean is a problematic thing for me.'

MailOnline revealed that Miss Dunham had landed the coveted spot earlier this month.

While it was yet to be announced 
officially, Anna Wintour gave her seal of approval to the actress-writer 
and her hit HBO show by turning up to the season three premiere in New 
York earlier this month.

Miss Dunham has famously been forced to defend her pride in her body. Howard Stern called her a 'little fat chick' last year, and Judd Apatow reveals that she was 'delighted' by the label.

But beyond being an inspiration to the masses of women who don't fit the supermodel physical idea, the star says there is immense purpose to each nude scene scripted into Girls.

'Seeing somebody who looks like you 
having sex on television is a less comfortable experience than seeing 
somebody who looks like nobody you’ve ever met'

'There was a sense that I and many women I knew had been led astray by Hollywood and television depictions of sexuality,' she explained. 'Seeing somebody who looks like you having sex on television is a less comfortable experience than seeing somebody who looks like nobody you’ve ever met.'

On another scandal that broke during season two following an episode in which Hannah has a weekend-long fling with a handsome doctor played by Patrick Wilson, Miss Dunham was stunned that viewers found it so controversial.

'Critics said, "That guy 
wouldn’t date that girl!"' she recalled. 'It’s like, "Have you been out
 on the street lately?" Everyone dates everyone, for lots of reasons we 
can’t understand. Sexuality isn’t a perfect puzzle, like, "He has a nice
 nose and she has a nice nose! She’s got great breasts and he’s got 
great calves. . ." It’s a complicated 
thing. I want people ultimately, even if they’re disturbed by certain 
moments, to feel bolstered and normalized by the sex that’s on the 
show.'

Anna Wintour's presence at the Girls 
season three premiere on January 6 was a major hint that Miss Dunham 
would appear on the Vogue cover.

The Vogue editor-in-chief, who wore a colorful Prada fur coat from the same collection that Lena wears in the issue, attended theevent with her daughter Bee Shaffer - a big fan of Girls.

She was extremely friendly with the cast, and posed on the red carpet with Lena. She also gave Alison Williams a big hug and a kiss once inside the venue.

But this is not actually Miss 
Dunham's first time in Vogue. In 1998, the magazine reveals, she 
featured as an 11-year-old in a spread about 'a New York pack of 
fashion-conscious kids'.

Sporting
 an outfit she had made herself, she had told the title: 'I really like 
Jil Sander, but it’s so expensive. . . I find Calvin Klein really hard 
to respect because he’s everywhere. I view him as a clothesmonger.'

Controversial: Vogue's decision to use just a head-shot of Miss Dunham on its cover threatens to escalate into a similar controversy that surrounded Mindy Kaling's new Elle cover

Vogue's decision to use just a head-shot of Miss Dunham on the cover, however, threatens to escalate into a similar controversy that surrounded Mindy Kaling's new Elle cover.

While her fellow comedienne insisted that she loved the cover, critics attacked Elle because Miss Kaling is only celebrated with a head shot, while Amy Poehler, Zooey Deschanel and Allison Williams are shown in color and nearly full-length.

Fashionista observed that 'at a a self-proclaimed size 8, [Ms Kaling] is hardly "plus size" — [but] gets a close-cropped image.'

Many fans also took to Twitter to voice their opinions. Danielle Odiamar tweeted: '*sigh* @mindykaling's gorgeous skin and curves deserve better.'

And Sarah Lasky Elison
 wrote: 'I love ELLE magazine and Mindy Kaling but am sad to see her 
cover is in B&W. She's a beautiful woman of color- why dull that? 
[sic]'

In a statement announcing the covers, Elle Editor-in-Chief Robbie Myers said: ‘There’s no denying that funny ladies are having a major moment, so devoting our Women in TV issue to the women making comedy was a must.’

In Vogue's recent history, Adele is the only other 'larger' 
celebrity to have featured on its cover. The title was praised for 
cropping the singer's body just below the bustline after the UK edition 
was slammed for dodging the opportunity to feature a larger body by only
 showing her face.

The February issue of Vogue hits newsstands on January 22.
