While many girls fret about being skinny in order to make it as a model, the career of Australian Robyn Lawley reached new heights after she embraced her curves.

The 24-year-old has appeared on the cover of Vogue, in campaigns for Ralph Lauren and on the catwalk at Milan Fashion Week as a plus-size model. Today she is signed to talent agency MiLK Model Management and has been chosen as one of the stars of a new Rankin campaign to promote the agency's varied roster.

Speaking at the shoot, the size 16 star told MailOnline she had tried to be a 'regular' model but her natural body shape didn't fit the mould. She wasn't prepared to starve herself to continue a career in modelling - and luckily she didn't have to after plus-size jobs became available.

Plus-size model Robyn Lawley is one of the MiLK Management stars to feature in Rankin's new campaign for the agency 

She revealed: 'I started out doing regular modelling as a teenager but I couldn't maintain a size 6 to 8 figure and that's what size all the samples are.

'I'm tall and I have big hips and shoulders. Even if I diet I can't shrink my bones. I had tried to be that skinny I would have ended up in hospital.'

Instead, a friend recommended Robyn tried plus-size modelling and she hasn't looked back.

Now she's in demand for editorial and commercial work and has launched her own swimwear range.  She said that she doesn't feel under pressure to diet to be part of the fashion industry so has no plans to lose her curves, like other plus-size models before her such as Crystal Renn.

Robyn explained: 'I am the perfect shape for plus-size modelling. I don't feel any pressure to lose weight as I've been this size for years now and I don't want to change or diet. I enjoy exercising and being able to eat foods I like.'

Body confident: Robyn Lawley said she's not going to diet and doesn't covet a size 8 figure

She added: 'It must annoy some of the
 other models when they see the plus-size models eating after they have 
starved themselves all night.'

But
 she admitted being plus-size can be both a gift and a curse in the 
fashion world and a lot still needs to be done to make curvaceous girls more accepted and catered for.

'Being a plus-size model in an industry 
where there aren't many means there are some opportunities I wouldn't 
have had otherwise,' she said. 'But there are also less jobs available, particularly
 in mainstream and high-end fashion.

'I
 know a lot of stunning girls who are not working because being a size 8 to 14 you are in no man's land even though you have a normal, healthy 
body.'

She added that she has had to work hard to prove herself as a model because of her size.

'People are surprised when I turn up on a 
shoot and I can model. But why shouldn't I be able to do it just because
 I'm a size 16?' she said.

While
 Robyn has had worldwide success in magazines and campaigns, she has had
 little work on the catwalk and she blames this on designers' reluctance
 to use models who are bigger than a size 8.

Role model: The Australian wishes there were more plus-size models like her

She said: 'It's disappointing as I love catwalk modelling, it's more 
exciting than being on a shoot so it sucks not to be included.

'Plus-size
 models are being used more in magazines and in the media but not on the
 runway and not by high-end designers like Prada. I'd love them to use 
more curvy girls but it's like a taboo and I don't know why. It screams 
lack of diversity.'

Her own career ambitions aside, the model claims that the lack of larger catwalk models is also damaging for young girls.

She said: 'It doesn't send out a good message to teenager girls who are impressionable. They're not coat hangers, they're girls and it's bad for them to only see skinny frames on the catwalk. I hope I can be a strong role model for them but there's not enough of us plus-size models.'

Robyn's values sit well with MiLK Management who also aim to celebrate diversity, which is reflected in their latest campaign showcasing their clients who include Ill Manors actor Sean Sagar, former X Factor contestants Union J and and another plus size model, Felicity Hayward. 

Founder, Anna Shillinglaw, a former model, describes MiLK as a boutique agency that understands no two models are alike.

She said: 'MiLK has been instrumental in pushing the boundaries in terms of diversity, we believe that there is no longer a standard size for modelling and we look at everyone's potential individually. It's about offering something unique and special to clients.'

MiLK's roster has already seen their models like Robyn grace covers from Italian Vogue to i-D, star in campaigns from Chanel to Victoria Secrets and runway shows from Calvin Klein to PPQ.

In 2013 they launched MiLK Special Bookings headed up by Calvin Morris, who prior to joining the agency, helped guide the career of Kate Moss for more than nine years.

The #MeetMiLK campaign aims to show off the agency's diversity of talent and features Union J and Lucille Boston the fashion dog
