In one of those Sliding Doors scenarios, Kieffer Moore would awake on Monday morning as the newest FA Cup hero.

He would survey the empty champagne bottles, the booty of a rollicking night before, while his mobile telephone beeped urgently with missed messages.

Every media outlet would want him, and every available parking space in his street would be occupied by outside broadcast vehicles.

His head would be hurting, as much from his hangover as the whack he received in the first half. The bandaging would still be on, but askew, and as he opened the door to fetch in the milk, a barrage of flashbulbs would explode before his furiously blinking eyes.

Here he is, the man who dumped Manchester United out of the FA Cup; the striker who stunned the wealthiest club in the land. The bandaged bandito, the fastest gun in the west. From Truro City to Wembley Way. Kieffer Roberto Francisco Moore. Late of Dorchester Town, now the talk of Yeovil Town - and many points beyond.

Not.

For, back in the real world, it doesn't happen like that. Not at all.

In the 55th minute, when Samuel Foley's cross falls to Moore in front of Manchester United's goal, he does not finish like a Ronnie Radford or Ray Crawford.

He panics, he snatches at it, he scuffs his shot. The ball rolls harmlessly to goalkeeper David de Gea, with all the venom of a back-pass. Moore is 22 and has only recently returned from injury. He is a tireless worker, but not the most clinical presence in the penalty box. 'He gave it a go,' said his manager Gary Johnson, sympathetically. 'There was nothing more to give.'

And so the best team win. Not the best team on the day, necessarily, because Yeovil's battling qualities should not be underestimated, and the scoreline flatters Manchester United a little; but the best team, because United were the only ones that looked like scoring and when Moore missed that chance the occasion assumed an air of inevitability. The players that Louis van Gaal has assembled were bound to break through sooner or later. Sooner, as it transpired.

Just nine minutes after Moore's fluff, Ander Herrera provided a lesson in the taking of opportunities. Of course that is the difference between shopping for players with a budget of £30,000 at Dorchester - as Johnson did when buying Moore - and purchasing one of the finest young midfield players in Europe for £29million from Athletic Bilbao.

Wayne Rooney played the ball square to Darren Fletcher and his pass to Herrera was cut out by the extraordinarily hard-working Simon Gillett, the pick of Yeovil's tenacious midfield.

Unfortunately, this intervention only succeeded in teeing the ball up for Herrera. It sat nicely before him and he struck a first-time shot that dipped and flew into the top corner, leaving goalkeeper Jed Steer with no chance. It is testament to Yeovil that, despite this setback, and the overwhelming odds, they refused to lie down.

In the 72nd minute, a header from captain Joseph Edwards — a Manchester United fan, he got Rooney’s shirt at the end — needed to be cleared from the line by Angel di Maria. That name alone shows what Yeovil were up against. Di Maria did not start the game, but came on as a second-half substitute for Radamel Falcao. Yeovil are bottom of League One. You do the maths.

So it was one of those rare occasions: credit to all and everyone home happy. The locals know they had a fair and courageous swing at it, but didn’t expect to win anyway; the travellers from Manchester knew their millionaires had been in a game but rose to the challenge.

Van Gaal later said that Rafael and Luke Shaw had suffered significant injuries early in the game, but soldiered on to half-time. Fans respect that. Of course, a 2-0 win at Yeovil is no less than is expected, but the FA Cup finds out the fainthearted soon enough — just look at Queens Park Rangers’ result on Sunday — and United treated Yeovil with the respect they, and the competition, deserved.

From the first minute when Moore gave De Gea a clump to see if he fancied the physical challenge — he did, although his kicking was poor — it was clear that Yeovil were up for the scrap.

A brutal 21st-minute clash of heads ended with Moore and Paddy McNair patched up by bandages and staples, and in the first half United were never allowed to settle. Their opportunities were greatly limited, a Rooney shot after 15 minutes, one from James Wilson that required a save 17 minutes later.

United had more control after half-time, but without creating a great number of chances. It was only when Yeovil pressed for an equaliser that United added emphasis to the scoreline with a second, scored by Di Maria on the break.

Yeovil lobbed a free-kick into the area, it was cleared and Rooney played a quite lovely pass out to the flank that Di Maria seized on breaking down the left. He drew Steer and then lifted the ball over him perfectly.

They won’t have seen too many finishes like that in League One and for good reason: Di Maria’s £60m transfer fee probably amounts to more than the total expenditure of every League One club combined.

Yeovil’s total budget is £1m and that doesn’t buy goals. This much was plainly obvious on Sunday. They have scored on just five occasions in the league at Huish Park and while United’s back line can be unconvincing they are still a considerable step up from the sort of defences that have held strong down here.

In the 73rd minute, Edwards fed Moore, but his shot deflected wide. It wasn’t his day. As Johnson spoke about the bravery of his players, his words were momentarily drowned out by Sir Alex Ferguson’s helicopter taking off from a nearby field.

There was to be no Wild West story down in Yeovil. This is the modern world.
