Nancy Snyderman has yet to return to NBC News after being quarantined in an Ebola scare in October.

The doctor and chief medical correspondent was one of a group of people forced into mandatory isolation for 21 days after cameraman Ashoka Mukpo was diagnosed with Ebola while the crew documented the spread of the virus in Liberia.

She prompted a storm of criticism when reports emerged stating she had violated the team's original voluntary quarantine order by driving to a cafe.

Despite planning to return in November, Snyderman remains absent from the channel and executives do not have a return date for her, CNN reported.

Questions:  Dr Nancy Snyderman is mysteriously absent from NBC after viewers complained she was 'arrogant, dismissive, and untrustworthy' for allegedly violating her Ebola quarantine in October

Following the three-week quarantine, the 62-year-old was told to take some time off and spend some time with her family.

A statement from NBC said: 'While in Liberia Dr Nancy and her team delivered first class, first-hand reporting from the front lines of this tragic and monumental story. Their subsequent departure from Monrovia, their return to the U.S. and period of quarantine has been a challenging time.

'We have encouraged them – and they have agreed – to take some time off with their families and friends to help restore some normalcy to their lives. We very much look forward to their return next month.'

The statement added that the network were relieved to say that Dr Snyderman and the rest of the crew were 'healthy and symptom-free'.  

Snyderman, a surgeon who spent 17 years reporting for ABC News before joining NBC in 2006, came under fire for allegedly violating her quarantine and then refusing to explain what happened.

The confusion sparked a furious response from thousands of viewers writing to the station to say they no longer trust Snyderman.

It left NBC with a major PR and credibility problem with bosses having to decide whether the medical editor's credibility can survive the incident. The network would not comment.

Snyderman was ordered into mandatory quarantine until Wednesday October 22 with the rest of her broadcast team after she allegedly violated their voluntary isolation. 

New Jersey health officials ruled that her quarantine should be mandatory after Snyderman and her crew were spotted getting takeout food from a New Jersey restaurant.

NBC won't give details about who went into the restaurant or how many of its employees were being quarantined.

Snyderman issued a statement saying 'members of our group' violated their pledge.

More than 1,100 people have subsequently written on Snyderman's Facebook page, many expressing anger. 

There were suggestions she should be fired or lose her medical license, and some viewers said they wouldn't trust her again. 

Snyderman's failure to be more specific about the lapse or take greater responsibility was another flashpoint.

Snyderman's 'arrogance and dismissiveness' create a huge PR and credibility problem for NBC, said Kelly McBride, an expert on ethics for the journalism think tank the Poynter Institute.

'People are so freaked out about Ebola that the problem NBC has now is that whenever they put her on the air, some news consumers are going to see the woman who put others at risk, rather than the reporter and professional with great experience,' McBride said.

McBride suggested that Snyderman 'lay low' or take a leave of absence. Certainly she should not report on Ebola anymore for the network, she said.

Future: Snyderman faced calls from viewers to leave the network which she joined in 2006

Susan Dentzer, a longtime health journalist and commentator for National Public Radio and the PBS 'NewsHour,' said people shouldn't forget that Snyderman put herself at risk to travel to Africa and cover the story. The public is reacting to a fear of Ebola instead of science, she said.

'She and her team clearly should have observed the terms of their quarantine, and she has said clearly that they made a mistake,' Dentzer said. 'But let's put it in a broader perspective.'

Before Snyderman's trip for takeout, ABC News' medical expert arguably had bigger problems. ABC health editor Dr. Richard Besser was in Africa at the same time as Snyderman and did not quarantine himself upon his return. That led ABC News President James Goldston to send his staff a memo explaining that the network was following medical advice.

Still, Besser was disinvited to a speaking engagement at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, he wrote last week in the Washington Post. Some colleagues have avoided him.

'I've been surprised by how many colleagues have waved from across the room and quickly made an exit,' Besser wrote. 'Others won't enter my office.'
