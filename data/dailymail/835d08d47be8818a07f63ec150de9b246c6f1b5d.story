Anxiang Du, 54, is accused of murdering former business partners Helen and Jifeng 'Jeff' Ding and their daughters Nancy, 18, and Alice, 12

Jurors wiped away tears today after listening to a horrific 999 call made as a businessman is believed to have been massacring an entire family of four.

Anxiang Du, 54, is accused of murdering former business partners Helen and Jifeng ‘Jeff’ Ding and their daughters Nancy, 18, and Alice, 12, in ‘simple revenge’ over losing a seven-year legal dispute.

Mr Ding, a 46-year-old lecturer in polymer science at Manchester Metropolitan University and his wife, a translator, 47, were stabbed to death with ‘ruthless efficiency’ in the kitchen of their executive home.

A court heard how police followed a trail of bloody footprints upstairs to a bedroom where their daughters had been attacked in similar fashion.  

In the 20-second emergency call, made from Alice’s mobile phone, two females were recorded delivering repeated, blood-curdling screams, as the operator attempted to ask if fire, ambulance or police were needed.

The call handler is then heard trying to pass the call on to police before the line abruptly falls silent.

Throughout the recording, one woman juror kept her face covered by her hands, as Du stared at the floor. Relatives of the Dings, who have travelled from China for the trial, stared ashen faced from the public gallery.

After the clip was played, Mr Justice Flaux asked the jury panel of eight women and four men whether they were able to continue, as one of their number dabbed at tears with her handkerchief. 

Prosecutor William Harbage QC had earlier warned the panel would have to ‘steel themselves’ to listen to the clip.

The jury has been told that the catalyst for the horror was an injunction which had been served on Du the night before the killing spree, which prevented him from disposing of his assets. Mr Harbage said Du realised he ‘faced ruin’, and planned the attack that night, travelling to the home ‘like a man on a mission’ and armed with a kitchen knife.

The court heard Mr Ding and his wife were stabbed to death in the kitchen of their home. It was told police followed a trail of bloody footprints upstairs to a bedroom where their daughters had been attacked in similar fashion

Yesterday the court heard from the neighbour who raised the alarm, after initially becoming concerned that the Dings had, ‘unusually’, left a garage door open.

Jason Horsley told the court he walked around to the rear of the Ding family’s £350,000 home in Wootton, Northampton, and, when he peered through a rear window, saw ‘what I thought was brown paint on the floor’.

When he looked more closely, Mr Horsley ‘saw a pair of legs (on the floor).’

He added: ‘It was then that I realised it was actually blood on the floor.’  Shaking and trembling, the neighbour asked his wife to call police.

Officers forced entry and discovered Mrs Ding behind the kitchen door, in her dressing gown, while her trouser-clad husband lay under a radiator. There was ‘blood spatter up the walls and around the kitchen’, while the blood on the floor was ‘black and dried’, the court heard.

Alice was discovered ‘curled up’ on a bed, while her sister lay on the floor, partially ‘tucked’ behind the headboard in a ‘prayer position’.

The ‘massacre’ unfolded on the day of the Royal Wedding between Prince William and Kate Middleton in April 2011, the jury heard. Afterwards, Du, who like Mr and Mrs Ding moved to the UK from China, fled in the family’s car. He was eventually tracked down to Morocco more than a year later, and was extradited back to the UK earlier this year.

The jury at Northampton Crown Court have been told there is no dispute that Du carried out the attack. But Mr Harbage told them he is expected to claim that he should be found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder, on the basis of either diminished responsibility or loss of control.

But Mr Harbage said: ‘The prosecution does not accept that this is anything other than the clearest case of murder, with the obvious motive of revenge, and any claim otherwise by Du is simply a blatant and transparent attempt to avoid his full responsibility for these grotesque killings.’

Du, from Coventry, denies four counts of murder.

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
