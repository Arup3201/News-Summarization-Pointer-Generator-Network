A perfect gentleman from Kazakhstan will be in London on Wednesday shaking hands, smiling and exchanging courtesies not only in his own language but in English – and in German or Russian should citizens of those countries happen to be in the room.

Do not be fooled, this is one of the most feared fighters in boxing today.

Gennady Gennadyevich Golovkin knocks out opponents for fun, 28 of them in 31 bouts for a 90 per cent KO ratio, which is the highest in modern middleweight championship history.

Higher, then, than Sugar Ray Robinson, Carlos Monzon, Sugar Ray Leonard and Marvin Hagler.

No wonder most of the starrier names in the division have been ducking this man like the plague.

To look at that happy, fresh face you might think you are in the company of a youngster in his graduate year at university. Do not be fooled.

Golovkin is 32 and extremely wise in the ways of the world. Not least the boxing world which kept him waiting until he was almost 30 for his chance to win a world title.

Since that explosive day only one of his challengers has survived longer than eight rounds and even he was gone two rounds later.

No rival has come close to beating him in those 31 professional bouts.

He has never been put down, let alone knocked out, in 375 fights as a world amateur champion and in the paid ring.

It takes a brave man to get into the ring with one of boxing’s archetypal baby-faced assassins.

Our own, admirable three-time world title challenger Matthew Macklin nerved himself to do that last year. For his courage he was felled in the third round by a body shot which left him writhing on the canvas and which he describes as ‘the most powerful punch I have ever been hit with.’

Next up Martin Murray.

Macklin has warned the man from St Helens of the dangers which lie ahead but Murray believes he can meet the most daunting challenge boxing can offer at the moment and win a world title at his third attempt.

Murray has been robbed in Germany by the home-town decision awarded to the then WBA champion Felix Sturm. After that he ventured into the Buenos Aires lair of Argentine ring maestro Sergio Martinez. There he came agonisingly close to winning the WBC belt before suffering his only defeat in 31 fights. It was very close, somewhat controversial, but a loss nonetheless.

Now for Golovkin, who has become a favourite of the HBO cable TV network in America but is travelling to Monaco for this one on February 21.

That is partly because the reformed Murray’s criminal record precludes him from obtaining a US visa.

For Golovkin, this a holding exercise while he awaits a first mega pay-per-view fight in America, perhaps against Miguel Cotto or Canelo Alvarez.

But Murray says: ‘I can be the first to topple him.’

Wednesday's gathering is a pleasantry designed to alert the boxing public in this country to their coming battle for the WBA title.

Murray is not fooled. But he never ducks anyone, either.

He knows that when the charming chap he welcomes to this country this morning appears in the opposite corner in Monte Carlo, Mr Golovkin will be no more Mr Nice Guy.

If Rourke's opponent took a dive his win was a despicable act 

There are allegations that the opponent who Mickey Rourke - Hollywood actor and once a bit-part boxer - knocked out in Moscow by way of making a bizarre ring comeback at the disturbing age of 62 was in fact a down-and-out living rough on the streets of Los Angeles who was paid to take a dive.

If so, this is as much sad as despicable.

Sad for the hobo, of course but also for Rourke who, it is further suggested, needs the money from not only this joke fight but as many more as he can finagle.

If the allegations are in fact revelations, this supply of cash will dry up pronto.

Rourke was a hell-raiser in Tinseltown but celebrity of the infamous genre is rarely insurance against humiliation in later life.

Sad for him too, then, that there should be no place in boxing for circus acts like his.
