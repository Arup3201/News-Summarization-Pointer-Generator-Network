A man who survived without a heart for a record two years has described how ‘incredibly lucky’ he feels after undergoing a successful transplant.

Matthew Green, 42, was the first Briton to be discharged from hospital with a completely artificial heart.

It meant the pharmaceutical consultant had to carry around a rucksack containing a battery-powered pump attached by tubes to his chest everywhere he went.

Life-saving: Matthew Green was the first person in the UK to receive a total artificial heart implant and be able to go home thanks to a portable pump, right

The pioneering operation was his only hope of surviving after he was hours from death through pressures on his fatally diseased organ.

But now after almost two years, he has received a donor heart and is recovering in hospital.

Mr Green, who lives with his wife Gill and seven-year-old son Dylan in London, said he has been granted a ‘third lease of life’.

Speaking from Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire where he is expected to be discharged soon, he said: ‘I feel incredibly lucky that I have been given a third lease of life as a result of my heart transplant.

‘It’s hard to put into words the gratitude I feel to my donor and their family. They have helped me turn my life around again.

Pioneering: Matthew's rucksack allowed him to leave the house for three-hour periods at a time

Innovative: Papworth Hospital, Cambridge is the UK's leading heart and lung transplant centre and fitted Matthew's artificial heart in a £100,000 operation

Miraculous: The device Matthew used is generally in service for around three years, during which it beat more than 200million times

‘I want to thank all the amazing 
staff at Papworth Hospital who have cared for me and I want to urge 
anyone who is thinking of registering on the NHS organ donor register to
 do it.’

Mr Green had 
been in a critical condition after the main chambers of his heart failed
 and no suitable donors could be found in July 2011.

With his health deteriorating fast, specialist surgeons at Papworth decided to fit him with the device in a £100,000 operation.

Some
 parts of the Total Artificial Heart have a 50-year working life, 
although patients are generally expected to use it for up to two years -
 during which it will ‘beat’ more than 200million times.

The
 rucksack contained a 14-pound battery powered pump that allowed him to 
leave the house for three-hour periods at a time. It costs 
£20,000-a-year to maintain.

Its US makers warn that using it more than two years because of the risk of blood clots building up.

Dr Denton Cooley implanted the first experimental device in Haskell Carp at St Luke's Hospital in Houston in 1969. The patient died three days later.Following animal testing in the 1970s, the next operation took place in 1982 when the Jarvik 7artificial heart was transplanted into a dentist called Barney Clark. 198 operations followed.By 2001 the first completely self-contained total artificial heart was implanted in Robert Tools at the Jewish Hospital in Louisville.And in 2008, Charles Okeke was implanted with the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart, becoming the the first patient to leave hospital with an artificial heart in May 2010.Since then the SynCardia Total Artificial Heart has been used in more than 900 implants in 65 hospitals.

There had been trouble finding a 
heart donor large enough to power Mr Green’s 6ft3in frame, but one was 
found last month - just before the two-year period ended.

It means Mr Green has the record for the longest time living outside of hospital with a completely artificial heart.

Steven Tsui, clinical director of 
transplant services at Papworth, said: ‘I am delighted that we were able
 to find a suitable donor heart for Matthew to have a heart transplant 
and I expect him to go home very soon.’ 

Before the initial operation to fit an artificial heart, Mr Green spoke of how the external pump would transform his life.

He
 was diagnosed with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy, a 
disease of the heart muscle that can cause arrhythmia, heart failure, 
and sudden death.

The 
exact cause of the condition - the second most common reason for sudden 
death in the young - is unknown, although it appears to be passed on 
genetically.

He said in
 2011: ‘It feels very different - before the operation my heartbeat was 
very weak and I could hardly feel my pulse. Now it’s a very strong 
heartbeat.

‘Two years 
ago I was cycling nine miles to work and nine miles back every day but 
by the time I was admitted to hospital I was struggling to walk even a 
few yards.

'I am really 
excited about going home and just being able to do the everyday things 
that I haven’t been able to do for such a long time - such as playing in
 the garden with my son and cooking a meal for my family.’

There
 are 214 people waiting for donor hearts in Britain, 15 of whom are 
children.

Many more are not even put on the transplant list because 
their chances of surviving are so slim.
