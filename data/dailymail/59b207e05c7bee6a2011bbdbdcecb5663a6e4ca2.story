A husband and wife have made the selfless gesture of each donating a kidney to complete strangers.

Alexis and Charles Wesley became the first couple in the U.S. to both donate kidneys to the National Kidney Registry.

The couple, from San Diego, made the decision after their children, who suffer from a rare joint disorder, had multiple free surgeries to help them walk. The parents' act of kindness was their way of paying the kindness and generosity forward.

Alexis Wesley told Fox5: 'Saving your kidney for a rainy day is like saving your fire extinguisher while watching your neighbor’s house burn.'

The couple's donated kidneys have saved ten lives across the U.S. Their donations set in motion a series of transplants - two in California, another two in Maryland along with one in Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York.

The couple say that they do not need to know who received the kidneys but simply asked if the surgeries had been successful.

Mrs Wesley had surgery at Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego on Monday. Mr Wesley had his surgery in April 2012 using a new, less-invasive keyhole technique.

Both parents said that they were feeling great after the surgeries.

Mr Wesley told Fox: 'You give up maybe three or
four weeks of your life in terms of having to go through recovery but 
you can extend someone else’s life by 10 or 15 years.

'I really wanted to be the person that was willing to do that.'

The Wesleys two young children, a boy Rolly and a girl Lali suffer from arthogryposis, a rare congenital disorder which causes muscle weakness and fibrosis.

The National Kidney Register is a 
non-profit organization which works by passing donors through a common 
registry to increase the speed of which they can be matched up with 
potential transplant patients.

It has facilitated more than 850 transplants since the registry was started in 2008.
