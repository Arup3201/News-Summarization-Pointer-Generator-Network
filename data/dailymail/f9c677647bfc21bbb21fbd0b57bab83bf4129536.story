Mothers with prams and wheelchair users are being forced to make a five-mile rail diversion - because a ramp on a platform was built six inches too low.

Network Rail started work on the £1million, 50ft access ramp at Heald Green, in Greater Manchester, last November.

But company bosses realised in April a flaw in the design meant it would not sit flush with the pavement on the lane outside.

Blunder: Network Rail started work on the £1million, 50ft access ramp at Heald Green, in Greater Manchester, last November but fenced it off when they realised a design fault meant it would not sit flush on the road

The ramp has now been fenced off while the problem is fixed - meaning travellers in a wheelchair or with a pushchair from Manchester cannot get off at the platform.

Network Rail has asked Stockport council to redesign and lower the pavement at Finney Lane to fit the ramp.

Inconvenient: Now disabled commuters have to stay on their trains to Manchester airport and return to Heald Green on a train that stops at a separate platform with a working access ramp

The £5,000 bill would be paid for by the rail firm. The work is expected to be finally completed by the end of September.

Peter Burns, a councillor for Heald Green, said it had been a ‘monumental blunder’ not to get the height of the ramp right.

He added: 'It is not rocket science. The road has not moved and the platform has not moved. They have botched the job and want to cobble it up to fix it.

'The Channel Tunnel is over 30 miles long. When the tunnels met in the middle, the heights differed by two and a quarter inches.

'Yet Network Rail and their contractors were six inches out in about 50ft, when you can see both ends.

'I have had numerous calls from residents about this. By the time it is completed it will be almost 12 months without disabled access which is appalling.'

Disability Stockport, a voluntary 
organisation which assists and supports people with physical 
disabilities, has called for Network Rail to give compensation.

Speaking out: Peter Burns, a councillor for Heald Green (pictured with local resident Carmel Treverton) said it had been a 'monumental blunder' not to get the height of the ramp right

Kieran
McMahon, from the group, said: 'This is very unfortunate and not 
acceptable. They should be thinking about compensating passengers and 
making journeys as easy as possible.'

Council
leader Sue Derbyshire said: 'The design and construction of the ramp at
Heald Green is entirely the responsibility of Network Rail.

'We
have received a new design from Network Rail to correct the error that 
proposes lowering the footway and are now in discussion with the 
affected utilities, whose plant in the footway may need diverting as a 
result of any lowering of the existing footway level.

Angry: Wheelchair users, such as Liz Curran (pictured) are furious about the blunder and want compensation

Kate Snowden, from Network Rail, said: 'We recognise that there was an error made in the design which resulted in the installation of the ramp approximately 150mm low and short of the Finney Lane pavement.

'To resolve this, we have been in contact with the local council with a proposed solution to alter the gradient of the pavement.

'We apologise for any inconvenience that this design error caused and we are working to get it fixed as soon as possible.'

But it was fenced off after an error in the design meant it would not sit flush with the pavement

So commuters who need the ramp must stay on train to Manchester Airport and get another back to use one on opposite platform
