Partying with beautiful women, racing European supercars and stealing selfies with Paris Hilton, the sons and friends of Mexico's most feared drug lords are not shy in keeping the world up to date with their exploits through Instagram and Twitter.

While countless people were killed just because they had seen reclusive Mexican Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquín (El Chapo) Guzmán Loera, his sons Alfred and Ivan Guzman appear to have no such worries.

Advertizing their ill-gotten wealth, no doubt bought with drug money from North America's most feared trafficking organization, Alfred and Ivan are joined showing off online by Serafin Zambada and Mayito Zambada - the sons of  Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada Garcia, who was El Chapo's right hand man.

Sharing through social media with them is Jose Rodrigo Arechiga Gamboa, or El Chino Anthrax, the hitman for the New Generation Cartel, who was arrested in December in Amsterdam, shortly after posting a seflie of him and an unaware Paris Hilton.

The less than discreet Twitter and Instagram accounts updated by the next generation of Mexico's deadly and dangerous drug cartels are a platform for them to threaten and to boast.

They update their feeds with pictures of their luxury cars, holding silver and gold embossed automatic weapons and posing up with scantily clad women.

Other shots show them parading their lion cubs and in other more frightening photographs, the personal armed guards they control which do their bidding.

Indeed, while tens of thousands have died during Mexico's bloody narcotics violence, the sons of the cartel leaders seem happy to show the world their collections of Porsche's and Ferrari's.

There are even risqué references to the plight of their father, who was apprehended after 13-years on the run and in hiding in February.

Of course their drugs and their money is blatantly put on display, as is their boasts of using bullet-proof glass in their supercars.

However, the sons of the drug cartel leaders would be well advised to heed the fate of their friend, El Chino Anthrax.

He was the suspected top enforcer for the powerful Sinaloa Cartel and is currently awaiting extradition to Southern California on drug charges.

Several folk songs, known as narcocorridos, mention 'El Chino Anthrax' as an elegant and fit man with a taste for sports cars, yachts and Champagne.

While it si not clear the exact role social media played in Arechiga's arrest but the International Business Times reported the information garnered provided important clues about his movements and contacts.

Arechiga is a right-hand man of Sinaloa bosses Ismael Zambada and Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman.

His identity was initially kept secret by Dutch police, who simply said they'd arrested a 33-year-old Mexican man on behalf of U.S. authorities.

His name was later leaked to the Associated Press by the law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person wasn't authorized to discuss the case.

He is being held in a Dutch jail, pending his extradition to the U.S.

El Chapo was taken into custody in February after a wiretap being monitored by ICE agents in Southern Arizona provided the final clue to Guzman's whereabouts days after he narrowly avoided capture in Culiacan, the capitol of Mexico's Sinaloa state.

Since Guzman's arrest some lawmakers have pressed for his extradition. He faces multiple indictments in the United States, including in Chicago, New York and San Diego.

John Feeley, principal deputy at the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said the Justice Department is the lead agency in asking for Guzman's extradition but the U.S. 'will be in discussions with the Mexicans.'

'But it may not result in immediate transfer,' Feeley said.

Rep. Paul Broun, a Georgia Republican, complained that those discussions should already be taking place. Broun said he worried that Mexico may be unable to keep Guzman jailed or prevent him from continuing to run his drug empire from jail.

Guzman was convicted in Mexico of drug and other offenses in the early 1990s and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He escaped in 2001.

'This is a question of trust and confidence in our partnership,' Feeley said. 'We have every trust and confidence that the Mexicans are able to hold him.'

U.S. law enforcement officials and the Homeland Security Department have long touted the relationship with their Mexican counterparts.

But in the early days of Pena Nieto's term in 2013, his government ordered that all contact with U.S. law enforcement would go through 'a single window.'

Sergio Alcocer, deputy foreign secretary for North American affairs, said at the time that all contact would be channeled through the federal Interior Ministry, the agency that controls security and domestic policy.
