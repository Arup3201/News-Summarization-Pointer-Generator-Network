A fossil of the largest known platypus has been discovered in Australia.

The remains, which are likely to be between 15 and five million years old, indicate that the ancient creature, which is related to the modern platypus, measured almost a metre in length.

Until recently, the fossil record indicated that the platypus lineage was unique, with only one species inhabiting the Earth at any one time.

Obdurodon tharalkooschild (reconstruction illustrated) was a giant toothed platypus from the the World Heritage fossil deposits of Riversleigh, Australia. At about one metre in length and with powerful teeth (inset: the holotype, a first lower molar), it would have been capable of killing much larger prey, such as lungfish

However, the discovery of the fossil casts doubt on the theory as the new, giant species of extinct playtypus was a side-branch of the platypus family tree, scientists said.

The new platypus species, named Obdurodon
 tharalkooschild, is based on a single tooth from the famous Riversleigh
 World Heritage Area of northwest Queensland.

While many of Riversleigh's fossil 
deposits are now being radiometrically dated, the precise age of the 
particular deposit that produced the tooth of the giant platypus is in doubt.

However, it is 
likely to be between 15 and 5 million years old, according to the study in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

'Monotremes (platypuses and echidnas) are the last remnant of an ancient radiation of mammals unique to the southern continents,' said PhD candidate Rebecca Pian, lead author of the study, which was conducted at the University of New South Wales.

'A new platypus species, even one that is 
highly incomplete, is a very important aid in developing understanding 
about these fascinating mammals,' she said.

Based on the size of fossilised tooth, it is estimated that this extinct species
 would have been nearly a metre long, which is approximately twice the 
size of the modern platypus.

The fossilised tooth was discovered in the richly fossiliferous freshwater limestones in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area (pictured) in northwest Queensland

No living mammal is more peculiar
 than the platypus.

When it was discovered by Western explorers in 1798, many believed sketches of the animal were a hoax because it seemed to share characteristics of totally unrelated animals.

It has a broad, duck-like bill, thick, otter-like 
fur, and webbed, beaver-like feet.

A platypus' snout is also covered with electroreceptors 
that help it detect underwater prey.

Modern platypus do not have teeth like their newly discovered ancestor, and resort to using gravel to 'chew' their crustaceans, larvae and worms.

Unlike other mammals, the platypus lays eggs instead of giving birth to live young.

Male platypus have a venomous spur on
 their hind foot.

Researchers said the bumps and ridges on the animal's teeth also provide clues about what the species ate.

Dr Suzanne Hand, a co-author of the study also at the university, said: 'Like other platypuses, it was probably a 
mostly aquatic mammal, and would have lived in and around the freshwater
 pools in the forests that covered the Riversleigh area millions of 
years ago.'

'Obdurodon tharalkooschild was a very 
large platypus with well-developed teeth and we think it probably fed 
not only on crayfish and other freshwater crustaceans, but also on small
 vertebrates including the lungfish, frogs, and small turtles that are 
preserved with it in the Two Tree Site fossil deposit.'

The oldest platypus fossils come from 61 million-year-old rocks in southern South America.

Younger platypus fossils are known from Australia in what is now the Simpson Desert, but before the discovery of Obdurodon tharalkooschild, these fossils suggested that platypuses became smaller and reduced the size of their teeth through time.

The modern platypus completely lacks teeth as an adult and instead has pads with tiny horns on, in its mouth.

The name Obdurodon comes from the Greek for 'lasting tooth' and was coined to distinguish extinct toothed platypuses from the essentially toothless modern species.

The modern platypus (pictured) is approximatley twice as small as its ancient relative. The living mammal has a broad, duck-like bill, thick, otter-like fur, and webbed, beaver-like feet

Dr Michael Archer, another co-author of the study by the University of New South Wales, said: 'Discovery of this new species was a shock to us because prior to this, the fossil record suggested that the evolutionary tree of platypuses was relatively linear one.

'Now we realise that there were unanticipated side branches on this tree, some of which became gigantic.'

The specific epithet of the new species, tharalkooschild, honours an Indigenous Australian creation story about the origin of the platypus.

In the Dreamtime, Tharalkoo was a head-strong girl duck inclined to disobey her parents. Her parents warned her not to swim downriver because Bigoon the Water-rat would have his wicked way with her.

Scoffing, she disobeyed her parents and was ravished by Bigoon. By the time Tharalkoo escaped and returned to her family, the other girl ducks were laying eggs, so she did the same.

But instead of a fluffy little duckling emerging from her egg, her child was an amazing chimera that had the bill, webbed hind feet, and egg-laying habit of a duck, along with the fur and front feet of a rodent - the first Platypus.
