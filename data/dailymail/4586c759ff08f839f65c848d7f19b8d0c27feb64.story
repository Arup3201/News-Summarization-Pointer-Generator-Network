Twitter users reacted angrily after this image was posed online, showing a bar advertising six shots for $10 - dubbing it the 'Michael Brown special'

A bar owner has caused controversy after offering a deal of six shots for $10 - naming it the 'Michael Brown special'.

The owners of Mug Shots bar in St Joseph, Missouri, put up a sign on Friday advertising the offer which references the number of times the unarmed teen was shot by officer Darren Wilson.

And when the deal caused outrage on Twitter, he tried to use the controversy to cash in, thanking people for sharing the story, and adding: 'everyone will know where the cheapest drinks are now.' 

According to the Kansas City Star, a worker at the bar wrote: 'Just wanna thank everyone who is going on about our shot special. Its just giving us free publicity. 

'Everyone will know where the cheapest drinks are now. It also shows everyone that we believe our slogan, "where sarcasm is always free."

'We have never been hateful to anyone because of race, class, sex or sexual preference.'

The sign was initially posted online on Saturday, along with the comment saying the bar owners 'might not have a functioning brain'.

The sign quickly drew criticism, with some Twitter users branding the bar 'racist', while user Randall G branded the stunt 'bizarre and disgusting', and another called Paula asked: 'What the f*** is wrong with people?' 

Around 20 protesters gathered outside the bar on Saturday, and the sign was later removed, and replaced with one mocking the owners.

The deal references the number of times unarmed teenager Brown was shot by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, St Louis, sparking months of protests (picured, officers stand over Brown's body)

The decision by a Grand Jury not to indict Wilson over the shooting caused fresh outcry two weeks ago, drawing people back on to the street of Ferguson, where there was widespread looting (file image)

A co-owner of the bar told Fox4 that other drinking spots in the same area had also been promoting Brown-themed promotions, so he decided to steal the idea for himself.

He added that the promotion had not meant to cause harm, and conceded that it had been unwise to make it a 'shot special'.

The news has emerged as Brown prosecutor Bill McCulloch continues to release Grand Jury evidence, which today included recordings of the moments after Brown was shot.

The radio conversations show that officers arriving on the scene in Ferguson, St Louis, made several panicked calls for backup and 'crowd control' before calling for medical assistance.

In one message, an officer says 'there's going to be trouble' as anguished wailing can be heard in the background.

The decision by a Grand Jury not to indict Wilson for the shooting caused outrage, sparking days of protests across the country, while shops in Ferguson were burned and looted.
