Three members of a sex bondage ring were ordered to stand trial 
Monday after six days of lurid testimony during which investigators 
outlined how they believe a Camp Pendleton Marine's wife was unwittingly
lured to a violent death when she agreed to go on a dinner cruise.

Superior
Court Judge K. Michael Kirkman said evidence suggested that 22-year-old
Brittany Killgore was the victim of a plan to act out a fantasy.

He 
ordered Louis Perez, 46, Dorothy Maraglino, 37, and Jessica Lopez, 25, 
to face trial on charges of murder, kidnapping, torture, attempted 
sexual battery and conspiracy.

Going forward: Louis Perez, 46, Dorothy Maraglino, 37, and Jessica Lopez, 25, will face trial on charges of murder, kidnapping, torture, attempted sexual battery and conspiracy

Tricked: Brittany Killgore, 22, never wanted to participate in the bizarre sex games that she was subjected to before her murder, prosecutors say

Despite
the discovery of Killgore's blood in Perez's car the day after her 
disappearance, defense attorneys argued that physical evidence was 
lacking.

Lopez's attorney, Sloan Ostbye, called her client 'the 
perfect slave' in the triangle and said her role explained why Lopez 
authored a handwritten letter taking full blame for Killgore's death.

In
the letter, Lopez claimed she killed Killgore out of fear that the 
woman would steal Perez, whom she described as her 'master.'

'It's not a confession letter, it's an exoneration letter ... to help mistress and master,' Ostbye said.

Killgore
disappeared in April 2012 after borrowing a purple evening gown for the
cruise, according to prosecutors.

Her nude, strangled body was four 
days later near Lake Skinner, north of San Diego.

Defendant: Dorothy Maraglino, also known as 'Dee', owned the San Diego house and was responsible for most of the decision making, even though Louis Perez was her 'sex master'

Contract of terms: Maraglino ran the household when Louis Perez - who was only there sporadically - was away

Defendant: Jessica Lopez is also accused of the kidnap and murder of Brittany Killgore, 22, wife of a Camp Pendleton Marine

Earlier Monday, 
the lead detective testified that a document attributed to Maraglino 
identifies her as a participant in a beating and asphyxiation.

'We
had the best of intentions and any injury or loss of life should be 
considered an accident,' read the document recovered from a CD.

Detective
Brian Patterson, who read the document aloud, said investigators also 
found whips, paddles, videos and other evidence of a sex bondage 
activity at Maraglino's home in Fallbrook, north of San Diego.

Another
San Diego County sheriff's detective, Daniel Pierce, testified that 
cellphone towers traced Lopez's phone to the area where Killgore's body 
was found.

The phone was located in the area shortly before 4 a.m., 
several hours after Killgore disappeared.

Last week, Elizabeth 
Hernandez, who was identified in court as the victim's best friend, 
testified that she and Killgore became acquainted with the defendants in
2011 after Hernandez responded to an ad selling a fertility monitor on a
website used by military families.

She said they used to socialize with
them but never participated in their alternative lifestyle in which 
Perez played the master, Maraglino was the mistress and Lopez was the 
slave.

Hernandez testified that she and Killgore had a falling out
in 2012 as the victim prepared to divorce her husband, Lance Cpl. Cory 
Killgore, who was serving in Afghanistan at the time of his wife's 
death.

She said Brittany Killgore started dating Hernandez's brother, and they started referring to her as 'the disease.'

A woman who lived in the same house 
testified Tuesday about the bizarre relationship between the trio - 
including who was the 'master' and who controlled the house.

The unidentified woman said that defendant Dorothy
Maraglino, also known as 'Dee', owned the San Diego house and was 
responsible for most of the decision making, even though Louis Perez was
her 'sex master'.

All three defendants are believed to have participated in an alternative lifestyle that included bondage and sadomasochism.

They engaged in those activities in 
the house, prosecutors have said, the same house where Killgore is 
believed to have been killed.

'I believe that Dee did most of the 
controlling in the house,' the witness testified on the second day of a 
preliminary hearing, and added that there was a 'contract' that laid out
the rules of their relationship.

Maraglino ran the household when Perez - who was only there sporadically - was away.

'It’s her house so she would make the rules in his absence,' the woman said.

Prosecutors and investigators have 
said that Killgore was not involved in the alternative lifestyle 
described in court, according to UT San Diego.

The three have pleaded not guilty to 
killing Killgore, who vanished last year 
while her estranged husband was serving in Afghanistan.

Prosecutors contend that Killgore met
the trio when she and a friend went to a home in Fallbrook, north of 
San Diego, to buy an item being sold online, according to the North 
County Times.

Killgore
turned down Perez's offer. However, later in the day, she sent him a 
text message asking if she knew anyone who could help her move.

'Party with me tonight & you’ll have five guys there in the morning,' he replied.

Killgore was last seen April 13 in a 
borrowed purple evening gown, three days after she filed for divorce 
from Lance Cpl Cory Killgore. Authorities have cleared him of any 
involvement in her death.

Authorities contend that Killgore was
kidnapped and made an unwilling participant in bondage and torture 
before she was strangled and her nude body left in a ditch near Lake 
Skinner in Riverside County.

San Diego County sheriff's detectives
said they found 'bondage-type sex apparatuses, toys and tools' in the 
Fallbrook home where the trio lived.

Missing: Brittany Killgore lived in Fallbrook, California, not far from Camp Pendleton US Marine base

Newly unsealed documents listed numerous bondage objects seized as evidence from the house of Louis Perez, Dorothy Maraglino and  Jessica Lynn Lopez.

A partial list follows:

Unsealed Court documents previously revealed that police seized whips, sex toys, rope and pulleys, a document 
titled 'Slave Rules', duct tape, a stun baton and other bondage 
instruments from the house.

Investigators 
found Killgore's blood and hair on several of the items.

Investigators said they believe all 
three were with Killgore at the home shortly after she apparently sent a
desperate text message to a friend that simply said: 'Help'.

In an affidavit filed in court last year, a detective said the trio may have targeted Killgore for 'unusual sexual fetishes'.

Perez was arrested on April 15 on suspicion of possessing a stolen assault rifle and was later charged with murder.

Lopez was arrested on April 17 at a San Diego hotel where she was discovered with self-inflicted cuts.

They also found a letter in which 
Lopez allegedly claimed that she killed Killgore out of fear that the 
woman would steal away Perez, whom she described as her 'master'.

Lopez said she tried to chop up 
Killgore's body with power tools before dumping it near the lake, but 
the body was found hours later.

The letter also contended that Perez 
and Maraglino weren't responsible for the killing. However, prosecutors 
said both were involved.
