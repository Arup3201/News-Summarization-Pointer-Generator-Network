An innocent family 
died when their home was set on fire in a bungled revenge attack that 
targeted the wrong address, a court heard.

Shehnila 
Taufiq, 47, her daughter, Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and Jamil, 15,
 perished after a ‘ferocious’ blaze engulfed their Leicester home in the early 
hours of the morning, a jury was told.

Mrs Taufiq’s husband, 
consultant neurosurgeon Dr Muhammed Taufiq Sattar, survived because he 
was working in Dublin at the time of the tragedy.

Seven men and a 
youth are accused of deliberately starting the inferno in 
Spinney Hills, Leicester. They all deny four counts of murder.

Nottingham
 Crown Court was told the intended target of the arson attack was 
teenager Abdul Hakim, whose mother lived just two doors away from the 
Taufiq family.

Seven hours earlier Hakim, 19, had been involved in a 
confrontation with football coach Antoin Akpom, a friend and associate 
of the accused, in which Mr Akpom was stabbed to death. The incident 
took place in Sussex Street, Leicester, less than a mile from the scene 
of the fire.

Prosecutors allege that the eight accused wanted to target the house of Abdul Hakim, who lived two doors away from the Taufiq family

Richard Latham QC, prosecuting, said the eight 
defendants struck at the mid-terraced home where Mrs Taufiq and her 
children were sleeping, believing it was linked to Hakim, who was known 
by his nickname of ‘AP’.

But Mr Latham added: 'They simply got the wrong house. A tragedy.'

The
 court heard one senior fire officer described the resulting blaze, 
which was started by petrol being poured through the letterbox then set 
alight, as the ‘worst he had ever attended’.

Another said it was ‘ferocious’, adding: 'The heat vented out was amazing.'

Mr
 Latham told the jury that despite the efforts of neighbours and fire 
crews, ‘nothing could be done’ to save the family after the fire was 
started at around 12.30am on September 13 last year.

The court heard that Dr Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar had spoken to his wife and children on the phone an hour before the fatal attack

He said: 'The primary means of escape was unavailable because the fire was at the
 bottom of the staircase. They were trapped upstairs.

'They had 
nothing to do with the events in Sussex Street, nothing to do with AP, 
whose mother simply happened to be a nearby neighbour.

'Those 
responsible, we say, are the eight defendants in the dock, who it 
alleged were all immediately outside when the fire was set.

'The prosecution case is this fire was set as part of the retribution process for the stabbing.'

Dr
 Sattar, who Mr Latham said had spoken to his wife and children on the 
phone just over an hour before the blaze started, listened from the 
public gallery as the prosecutor outlined the case to the jury.

He said the death of Mr Akpom, 20, was the ‘background’ to the fire, which he described as a ‘horrendous act’.

The
 court heard he was stabbed once in the back during an incident 
involving Hakim and another 19-year-old, Hussein Hussein, outside a gym.
 Hussein, a Somali refugee from London, was convicted of Mr Akpom’s 
murder and jailed for life earlier this month.

The court heard that Shehnila Taufiq, her daughter Zainab, and sons Bilal, and Jamal died in the blaze at the family's home in Wood Hill, Leicester, pictured

Mr Latham told the 
court it quickly became ‘common knowledge’ Hakim had been involved in 
the incident that resulted in the death of Mr Akpom, and that the 
defendants soon ‘involved themselves in an evolving plan that resulted 
in all eight being at Wood Hill in the moments before the fire’.

He
 added they travelled to the scene in two cars, one of which had to be 
abandoned after the blaze was started because it was accidentally 
blocked in by another vehicle, and that there was evidence all eight had
 stopped using their mobile phones in the build-up to the fire.

Mr Latham told the jury that the eight defendants had 'acted in concert'.

He said: 'All the defendants were there and willing and able to give support to the enterprise.'

Mr Latham added that by the time Mrs Taufiq’s home was set alight, Hakim had already left Leicester and was in London.

The
 accused are 19-year-olds Kemo Porter and Nathaniel Mullings, Aaron Webb
 and Jackson Powell, both 20, Akeem Jeffers, 21, Tristan Richards, 22, 
Shaun Carter, 24, and a 17-year-old who cannot be named for legal 
reasons. The men all come from Leicester apart from Jeffers, who is from
 Leeds.

All of the defendants deny all of the charges.

The trial, which is expected to last up to eight weeks, continues.
