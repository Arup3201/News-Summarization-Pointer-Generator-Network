Less than four years ago campaigners were calling on the public to help keep Britain's soaring deer numbers under control by eating more venison.

But now supermarkets are struggling to keep up with the demand for the deer meat which has surged over the past year, with heavy promotion by celebrity chefs as well as apparently being a favourite of Prince William.

It is no longer only in farmers’ markets and 
independent butchers, and  estate shops - venison is on supermarkets shelves in sausages and burgers, as well as more traditional 
steaks.

Rising popularity: Supermarkets are struggling to keep up with the demand for the deer meat which has surged over the past year, with heavy promotion by celebrity chefs as well as apparently being a favourite of Prince William

Despite the recession, sales have increased by up to 50 per cent over the past 12 months.

Marks & Spencer has reported it sold three times as much venison last year as in 2010.

It increased its venison range for Christmas, after recording a 78 per cent rise in sales in stores across the UK and Ireland.

Sainsbury’s said that sales of its 
own brand of venison had almost doubled year-on-year. It said sales of game overall, including venison, wood pigeon, quail and rabbit, were up by a third year on year.

Asda reports an increase of more than 30 per cent year on year.

Waitrose said that sales were up by a third, with steaks selling particularly well.

It was reported the supermarket  has 20 per cent of the expanding venison market and is looking to double its sales. Typically, strongest sales are November to January.

Sensing the growing market, the Co-operative will stock venison for the first time next month.

Venison - the ultimate low fat red meat - is used in Jamie Oliver's venison and juniper stew as well as other TV chefs such as Delia Smith who uses it in her venison steaks with cranberry cumberland sauce recipe and Rachel Koo's venison wellington has also helped popularise the meat .

Venison fans believe it is the ideal meat because it is lean and full of flavour - it has a third of the fat of chicken.

Apparently venison stew is Prince William's favourite dish - he is said to have eaten it last weekend with the Duchess of Cambridge when they celebrate their first weeding anniversary.

Waitrose meat buyer Andy Boulton told Meat News: 'Venison has been a significant growth area. 

'We want to be able to provide a supply of quality venison all year round and to do that we have to import some from New Zealand, but we are working closely with both groups of farmers and they are operating to the same welfare and slaughter standards. Farmed venison offers more consistency than wild venison' he said.

Sensing the growing market, the Co-operative will stock venison for the first time next month. 

But with less than 100 deer farms in 
Britain, suppliers are struggling to keep up with the demand and 
retailers are now looking to suppliers abroad.

They have already turned to country parks such a Harewood Park in Hertfordshire and Woburn Abbey estate in Bedfordshire.

The Yorkshire Venison Centre, who now have to import alot of their stock from New Zealand,  said they have noticed a steady increase in popularity, which can be attributed to both TV chefs and health conscious consumers.

'We are trying to convince more farmers to become venison farmers. People prefer farmed meat as to wild meat, which can be lovely, but is not always consistent. When you hear about dairy farmers going out of business, we think they could become deer farmers and we are trying to persuade them to see how easy it can be if they already have the grass.'

Deer can be classified as wild deer,
park deer (reared in herds that roam parklands) or farmed deer (rearing
varies from free-range to intensive).

The most common varieties of deer in the UK are red, fallow and roe.

Ingredients

• 4 tablespoons plain flour• sea salt and freshly ground black pepper• 800g stewing venison or beef, cut into 2cm chunks• olive oil• 2 onions, peeled and roughly chopped• 3 carrots, peeled and roughly chopped• 2 sticks of celery, trimmed and roughly chopped• 1 tablespoon juniper berries, crushed in a pestle and mortar• 2 sprigs of rosemary, leaves picked and chopped• a knob of butter• 6 sprigs of fresh flat-leaf parsley• 2 beef stock cubes, preferably organic• 600g small new potatoes, scrubbed clean, larger ones halved• 1 clove of garlic, peeled and finely chopped

Method

Dust a chopping board with 2 tablespoons of flour and a good pinch of salt and pepper, and toss your chunks of meat through this mixture until well coated. Heat a large pan on a high heat, add a few lugs of olive oil and fry your meat for 3 minutes to brown it. Add your chopped onions, carrots, celery, crushed juniper berries, rosemary and the knob of butter. Add a few tablespoons of water, give everything a good stir, then pop the lid on the pan and let everything steam for 4 to 5 minutes so the flavours really mingle together.

Take the lid off so your meat and veg start to fry, and stir every so often for 5 to 10 minutes. Chop your parsley stalks finely, and once the onions start to caramelize, add them to the pan with your remaining 2 tablespoons of flour and your crumbled stock cubes. Stir, and pour in enough water to cover the mixture by a couple of inches. Put the parsley leaves aside for later.

Bring to the boil, then turn the heat down to medium low so that the stew is just simmering. Add your potatoes and slow cook for at least 2 hours with the lid slightly askew, or until the meat falls apart easily. Keep an eye on it as it cooks, and add splashes of water if you think it looks too dry.

Put your chopped garlic in the middle of a chopping board. Add most of your parsley leaves with a teaspoon of sea salt and ½ a teaspoon of black pepper. Chop everything together so you get a kinda chunky paste. Add this to the stew and stir through. Chop the last of your parsley leaves and sprinkle over before serving.
