A father has told how his ‘innocent, beautiful’ one-year-old son lost a leg to meningitis.

Gareth Stephenson’s son, Noah, one, contracted meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia in March, when he was just eight-months-old, and had to spend six weeks in hospital fighting for his life.

The disease caused the lower part of his left leg to die meaning that it had to be amputated.

Noah, from Cardiff, also lost the ends of all of his fingers and some of his toes.

His parents realised that there was something wrong when he became lethargic and lost his appetite. As this is not unusual for a baby, they were not overly concerned.

However, later that day his lethargy increased and he stopped reacting to his parents entirely.

As a result, they rushed him to the local hospital where a doctor thought he might have bronchiolitis – a lower respiratory tract infection.

He was not entirely sure of the diagnosis so suggested that Noah be taken to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.

Noah's parents realised that there was something wrong when he became lethargic and went off his food. He deteriorated rapidly and soon became unresponsive and developed breathing difficulties

When he arrived, he started to deteriorate rapidly.

Mr Stephenson said: ‘Noah was struggling for breath and his heart rate and blood pressure were low.

‘He started getting a few spots around his eyes and mouth and luckily for us the doctors could see his symptoms developing and they quickly suspected meningitis and acted accordingly.

‘He was put on numerous drips, and was sedated with help from a ventilator machine to regulate his breathing.

Noah was rushed to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, where doctors diagnosed his meningitis and put him on a ventilator to regulate his breathing

‘Very quickly it became apparent that he was losing and leaking fluid internally, so they were forced to replace the liquids very quickly.’

Within a few hours, Noah’s body had swelled up and he was fighting for his life.

His parents were told that he might not survive the night.

Mr Stephenson said: ‘We were told to prepare for the worst but to take things minute by minute.

At the hospital, Noah's parents were told to prepare themselves for the worst. As the disease took hold, he lost the circulation to his extremities which meant his lower leg and the tips of his fingers died

‘What was easily the most horrific and scariest few hours of mine, and my family’s, life, then turned into a waiting game as we couldn't see Noah as the medical staff were working furiously to keep him alive.’

As Noah’s body fought the disease, he lost circulation to his hands and feet and they quickly turned black.

Doctors made three cuts along his lower left leg in an attempt to ease the pressure, and to try and restore the circulation.

Noah's left leg was amputated below the knee and the tips of his fingers and toes fell off without surgery. His parents say that he started to crawl again very quickly after leaving hospital

Despite this effort, it was soon clear that his lower left leg was dead tissue and that it was only acting as another hindrance to him as he battled for his life.

As a result, the decision was made to amputate Noah’s lower left leg below the knee.

Mr Stephenson said: ’After the amputation, Noah started improving day by day, but the tips of his fingers and toes remained black and dead. Over the next few weeks, he stayed in hospital improving all the while.

‘After ten days he was brought out of sedation and, after what seemed like an eternity, our little boy woke up.

Noah's father, Gareth Stephenson said: 'I can only say the whole experience was surreal, horrifying and extremely concerning.' Noah is pictured with his brother, Zak

‘His fingertips and toes gradually settled at being black, shrivelled and dead and we were informed they would probably fall away over time - it was just a hope for him to get as much back of them as possible.’

Noah finally left hospital after six weeks and returned home to recover.

His father said: ‘Noah started crawling again very quickly, and once his fingers tips had fallen away he started using his hands like nothing had ever happened - like he wasn't missing parts of them.

‘In total he lost his lower left leg, the tips of all his fingers in varying degrees and half of his remaining toes - except the big one on which he just lost the nail.’

Mr Stephenson said: 'I knew about the effects of meningitis beforehand from what I'd seen on the news, but I never thought something so cruel could happen so indiscriminately to an innocent, beautiful child'

Mr Stephenson added: ‘I can only say the whole experience was surreal, horrifying and extremely concerning.

‘The thought of losing our baby was inconceivable and thankfully we got most of him back to where he should be, home.

‘I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone. I knew about the effects of meningitis beforehand from what I’d seen on the news, but I never thought something so cruel could happen so indiscriminately to an innocent, beautiful child.’

‘I can never ever thank the medical staff who treated and saved Noah’s life enough, I owe them everything.’

Noah is now learning to walk with a prosthetic leg (pictured). His parents hope he will be able to walk down the aisle as a page boy at his uncle's wedding next year

Mr and Mrs Stephenson have just secured Noah his first prosthetic leg and say that within 15 minutes of having it fitted, he stood up on it for the first time.

They are raising money to pay for the specialist prosthetic leg that he will need in the future.

They hope that he will now learn to walk so that he can be a page boy at his uncle’s wedding next year.
