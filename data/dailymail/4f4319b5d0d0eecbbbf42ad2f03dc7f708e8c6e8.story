 A 12-year-old girl survived being shot by two teenagers who were 'trying to aim at another target' at a playground in The Rockaways in Brooklyn, New York on Friday.

Police responded to a call after 5 p.m. about a shooting on the basketball court. When they arrived found the young teenage girl, Aliyah Vargas, 12,  who'd been shot in her left thigh.

The Gothamist reports that Dwight Henderson, 18, is charged with attempted second degree murder, assault, and criminal use of a firearm, criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment, and resisting arrest.

The scene: Police responded to a call of a shooting on the basketball court at Beach 59th and Shore Front Parkway

Geena Hill, 16, was charged with third degree criminal possession of a defaced weapon, and second degree criminal possession of a loaded firearm.

Police believe the shooters were aiming at another target and that the male suspect, Dwight Henderson, shot Vargas.

Police apprehended the suspects who originally fled the scene after they searched the area.

They saw a teenager who fit the description of the shooter standing with the girl on a nearby street corner handing her a weapon.

Police recovered a loaded 9 mm handgun from the two of them.

Both of the teenagers live in Rockaway.

Police were already in the area monitoring a basketball tournament.

The New York Daily News reports that investigators believe the shooters were aiming at someone other than Vargas.

The motive for the shooing is still being investigated but witnesses say that gun play has become a problem in the area.

The Mail Online contacted police who were not available for comment.

The victim is in stable condition at North Shore LIJ hospital.

The New York Daily News spoke with resident Tashshawna Shim-hue, 23, who said she saw cars speeding down the street after the shooting.

'It’s getting ridiculous over here,' she said.

'I’ve been here all my life and I think this is the worst I’ve ever seen it.'
