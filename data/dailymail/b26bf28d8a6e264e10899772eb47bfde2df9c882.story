The US and Russia have promised to set a date for a long-awaited 'peace conference' aimed at ending the bloodshed in Syria once and for all, Secretary of State John Kerry has revealed.

Dubbed 'Geneva 2', the summit will see top brass from both countries meet to thrash out a solution to the civil war that has raged since March 2011 at a cost of more than 100,000 lives.

Speaking after today's talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, Mr Kerry said they planned to meet again on the fringes of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month to try and set a date for the conference.

However, the vow comes as rebels claim President Assad is simply using the Russians to 'buy time' so he can continue killing with the conventional arsenal he still has at his disposal despite a promise to relinquish his chemical weapons.

US officials also claimed one of Assad's secretive military units has been moving chemical weapons to as many as 50 different sites over the last few months, just in case America attack.

Vow of action: Speaking after today's talks with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, Mr Kerry said they planned to meet again on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month to try and set a date for the conference

Free Syrian Army spokesperson Louay Moqdad told the BBC Assad still 
has plenty of conventional weapons at his disposal and he is attempting 
to 'buy time' with the help of the Russians.

Meanwhile, as American and Russian chemical weapons experts huddled in a Geneva hotel to haggle over technical details that will be critical to reach a deal, Mr Kerry and Mr Lavrov met with UN-Arab League envoy Lakdar Brahimi to examine political developments and plot a new international conference to support the creation of Syrian transitional government.

Mr Kerry, flanked by Mr Lavrov and Mr Brahimi, told reporters at the UN in Geneva after an hour-long meeting on the second day of their talks that the chances for a second peace conference in Geneva 'will obviously depend on the capacity to have success here ... on the subject of the chemical weapons.'

Mr Brahimi also met privately with Mr 
Kerry at a Geneva hotel yesterday to explore ways to resume 
international negotiations last held in Geneva in June 2012 aimed at 
ending the Syrian civil war.

Agreed: Dubbed 'Geneva 2', the summit will see top brass from both countries meet to thrash out a solution to the civil war that has raged since March 2011 at a cost of more than 100,000 lives

Mr Lavrov said it was 'very unfortunate that for a long time that the Geneva communique was basically abandoned.'

Mr Kerry and Mr Lavrov announced they 
would meet again in New York toward the end of the month to try to fix a
 date for second conference.

When the talks began yesterday, Mr 
Kerry bluntly rejected a Syrian pledge to begin a 'standard process' by 
turning over information rather than weapons - and nothing immediately. 
The American diplomat said that was not acceptable.

'Buying time': However, the vow comes as rebels claim President Assad is simply using the Russians to 'buy time' so he can continue killing

'The words of the Syrian regime, in our judgment, are simply not enough,' Mr Kerry declared as he stood beside Mr Lavrov. 'This is not a game.'

The talks were the latest in a rapidly moving series of events following the August 21 gas attack on suburbs in Damascus. The US blames Syrian President Bashar Assad for the use of chemical weapons, although Mr Assad denies his government was involved and instead points to rebels engaged in a two-year-old civil war against his government.

President Barack Obama began building a case for support at home and abroad for a punitive military strike on Mr Assad's forces, then changed course and asked Congress to give him explicit authority for a limited strike. With the prospect that he might lose a vote on action, Mr Obama said he would consider a Russian proposal calling for international control of Mr Assad's chemical weapons and their eventual destruction.

Mr Obama dispatched Mr Kerry to Geneva to hammer out the details of the proposal even as he kept alive the possibility of US military action.

'We believe there is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,' Mr Kerry said on the opening day of talks. The turnover of weapons must be complete, verifiable and timely, he said, 'and, finally, there ought to be consequences if it doesn't take place.'

Mr Lavrov seemed to contradict Mr Kerry's negative view of Mr Assad's offer to provide details on his country's chemical arsenal beginning 30 days after it signs an international convention banning such weapons.

Syria's ambassador to the United Nations said that as of yesterday his country had become a full member of the treaty, which requires destruction of all chemical weapons.

The Russian said the initiative must proceed 'in strict compliance with the rules that are established by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.' That suggests Russia does not agree with the US that this is an exceptional case and that Syria should face tougher standards than other countries.

'We proceed from the fact that the solution to this problem will make unnecessary any strike on the Syrian Arab Republic, and I am convinced that our American colleagues, as President Obama stated, are firmly convinced that we should follow a peaceful way of resolution to the conflict in Syria,' Mr Lavrov said.

The distrust in US-Russia relations was on display even in an off-hand parting exchange at the news conference. Just before it ended, Mr Kerry asked the Russian translator to repeat part of Mr Lavrov's concluding remarks.

When it was clear that Mr Kerry wasn't going to get an immediate retranslation, Mr Lavrov apparently tried to assure him that he hadn't said anything controversial . 'It was OK, John, don't worry,' he said.

'You want me to take your word for it?' Mr Kerry asked Mr Lavrov. 'It's a little early for that.'

They were smiling at that point. Shortly after making their opening statements, the two went into a private dinner.

Mr Assad, in an interview with Russia's Rossiya-24 TV, said his government would start submitting data on its chemical weapons stockpile a month after signing the convention. He also said the Russian proposal for securing the weapons could work only if the US halted threats of military action.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said today that Syria's efforts have demonstrated its good faith.

'I would like to voice hope that this will mark a serious step toward the settlement of the Syrian crisis,' Putin said at a At a meeting in Kyrgyzstan of an international security grouping dominated by Russia and China.

Even as diplomacy took centre stage, word surfaced that the CIA has been delivering light machine guns and other small arms to Syrian rebels for several weeks, following mr Obama's statement in June that he would provide lethal aid to the rebels.

US intelligence officials said the CIA has arranged for the Syrian opposition to receive anti-tank weaponry such as rocket-propelled grenades through a third party, presumably one of the Gulf countries that have been arming the rebels.
