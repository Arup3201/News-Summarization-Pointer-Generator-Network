Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the levy would be ratcheted up for the most expensive properties

Owners of multi-million pound homes will be hit hardest by Labour’s mansion tax, Ed Balls vowed today.

The shadow chancellor insisted people trapped in expensive homes who have no access to savings will be protected from the charge aimed at properties worth £2million or more.

But he promised to hike the levy for homes with over £10million, to ensure they make a ‘significantly bigger contribution’.

Labour has joined the Liberal Democrats in promising an extra charge on expensive properties, to target rich homeowners – especially wealthy foreigners who buy up properties in London.

The move has been seen as an attempt by Labour to woo the Lib Dems in the event of another hung parliament leading to a coalition with Nick Clegg’s party.

Today Mr Balls gave more detail of the scheme, but still failed to put a figure on how much the charge will be.

Writing in the Standard, he said: ‘How can it be right that the foreign buyer last month of a £140 million flat in Westminster will pay just £26 a week in council tax — the same as the average-value property in that council area?’

Under the details announced today, the £2million limit will rise in line with property prices, instead of inflation ‘to ensure that more modest properties are not brought into the scope of the tax’.

Nationwide prices are up 8 per cent year-on-year, while in London prices have risen 18.7 per cent in the last 12 months.

There will also be protection for people who do not have large savings or higher earnings, but who live in an expensive home.

This is likely to apply to widows or families who have lived in the same property for many years.

Mr Balls promised a ‘relief scheme’ which could include allowing those on modest incomes to defer payment until the property is sold.

The mansion tax will also be ratcheted up on the most expensive properties, so the wealthiest pay most.

The Lib Dems used to argue in favour of a 1 per cent charge on the value of any home worth more than £2million, but there are concerns it would be difficult to implement.

Labour would introduce ‘bands’, similar to those used for council tax, with a higher charge on the biggest houses.

Mr Balls said: ‘The tax must be progressive so that those with properties worth tens of millions of pounds make a significantly bigger contribution than those in houses just above the limit.

‘But it must also be administratively simple. The original proposal by the Liberal Democrats for a one per cent annual charge on the value of the house above £2 million would require detailed valuations each year and fails that test.

‘I believe a better way would be to use a banded system, which avoids the need for detailed annual valuations.’

It could be modelled on a banded system introduced by the coalition government o target properties bought through companies to reduce tax.

It groups homes together in bands: £2-£5 million, £5-10 million, £10-20 million and over £20 million.
