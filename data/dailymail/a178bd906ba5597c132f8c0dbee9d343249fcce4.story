So it was fixed right? Well probably not.

While many have speculated over new La Liga fixtures managing to put the first Clasico of the season on the weekend that Luis Suarez comes back from his four-month ban.

To ensure Suarez played a full-part in that first Real Madrid vs Barcelona game of the season the Spanish League would have needed to schedule it a bit later. If they fixed it they made a pretty bad job of it.

Return date? Luis Suarez could make his  first Barcelona appearance against Real Madrid

Big draw: Barca fans will be keen to see their new man in action against their fierce rivals

If the game is played on Saturday October 25 Suarez will still not be eligible (it will be the last day of his ban) and if it’s played on Sunday 26 he still will not have trained with his team-mates at least not under the current FIFA restrictions on him so much as running around a training pitch with them.

Spanish football will want Suarez on the pitch for what is already being billed as the BBC (Bale, Benzema and Cristiano) against SNM (Suarez, Neymar and Messi). But the Spanish League computer has not made that a certainty.

It should be game-on however in the second half of the season. When the meeting in the Camp Nou comes around in March we will see the two most expensive forward lines in history battle it out. The game at the Camp Nou falls on the weekend of March 21-22.

As always the Spanish season repeats the first half of the campaign with games in exactly the same order. The first six weeks of the season are usually blocked-out by the League computer preventing a Madrid vs Barcelona match happening too early in the season and therefore the return leg also happening too late.

The last six weeks are also blocked preventing a Madrid v Barcelona match coming too close to Champions League semi-finals so that effectively leaves quite a small window of opportunity.

Barcelona president Jose Maria Bartomeu was sat next to Florentino Perez at Spanish League headquarters along with the other 18 club presidents on Thursday lunchtime. He will now hope more than ever that when the court of arbitration for sport reviews the Suarez case in the second week in August it will change the draconian ruling that prevents him so much as training.

He’ll want the European Golden Boot winner as fit as possible to take on Pepe and Sergio Ramos in the old enemy’s amphitheater.

Because there are Champions League games the week previous to the weekend of October 25-26 the game will almost certainly be scheduled for the Sunday so it could be some debut for Suarez, albeit from the bench after his four months out of action.

'It’s all still a long way off,' said Real Madrid spokesman Emilio Butragueño. It must seem that way for Barca’s sidelined striker.
