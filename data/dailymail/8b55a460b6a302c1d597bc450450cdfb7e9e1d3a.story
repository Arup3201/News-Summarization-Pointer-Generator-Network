Doing the dishes is hardly an inspirational part of the day for most of us.

But when 58-year-old Jane Thomas was doing the washing up she noticed colourful patterns in the bubbles and decided to turn it into art.

Mrs Thomas, from Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, has been a keen photographer for many years but never realised she could find the perfect picture as part of her daily routine.

The images were created using a macro lens, a remote control shutter and an angle poise lamp instead of flash

Such a chore: Jane Thomas noticed the beautiful patterns in the soapy water when she was doing the dishes

Mrs Thomas said: 'I leaned in very closely and saw that 
there were tiny patterns swirling about so rushed off to find my camera 
and try some experiments.

'I'm a very keen photographer always looking for unusual subjects. There are none more so than the strange and fantastic patterns in soap - the flat film in a child's 'bubble wand' before it is blown into bubbles.

Just a few millimetres at a time are photographed by Jane Thomas in order to create the stunning images

Blu tack, children's bubble mixture, a bubble wand and an angle poise lamp were used to set up each photograph

True colours: Different soaps create different effects depending on their thickness

'The liquid swirls around and colourful shapes can be seen and will amaze you if you look very closely.

'I like to photograph them with my Nikon D600 camera and Nikkor 105mm macro lens. I don't use flash, just a small office angle-poise lamp, and I use a remote control shutter release cable in my left hand while I focus with the right.

'Technically speaking, the patterns arise naturally from the interference of reflected light rays from the front and rear surface of a thin film of soapy water in the tiny frame or 'bubble wand'.

Soaps of varying levels of thickness were used by Jane Thomas to create different effects

Former teacher Jane Thomas says she is a keen photographer and she looks for 'unusual' subjects

'The inner circle which I use for most of these photos measures approx 18mm. Most of the shots are of very tiny areas - just a few millimetres - within that ring.

'It's almost impossible to photograph the whole area because only small parts are in focus at any one time.

'I have since experimented with lots of soaps, especially the commercially available 'bubble mixture' that comes in little pots for children but also shampoos and different washing up liquids.

'The thicker the better because the patterns last longer.'

Wave of colour: No flash was used to produce the images of the soapy effects
