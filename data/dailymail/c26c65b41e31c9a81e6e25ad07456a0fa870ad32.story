The time it takes to switch electricity and gas suppliers will be halved under proposals by energy regulator Ofgem.

From December 31, switching times will fall to two-and-a-half weeks – three days plus a 14-day cooling-off period.

And today, the watchdog published plans to introduce next-day switching by 2018.

Welcome news: The time it takes to switch suppliers will be halved under proposals by energy regulator Ofgem

Around 62 per cent of people have never switched energy supplier, Ofgem revealed. They could save up to £200 a year, it said.

Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: 'Consumers can change their bank in seven days, their mobile phone
 in just a couple, but have to wait significantly longer to switch their
 energy supplier.'

‘We hope this will give consumers more confidence to start shopping around.’

Currently switching takes five weeks, including a statutory two-week cooling-off period that came into force in June.

The regulator has been working with 
energy suppliers and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) 
to speed up switching times.

Ofgem’s
 additional proposals to introduce next day switching by 2018 at the 
latest will still include the 14-day cooling off period, but this will 
begin after a customer has changed supplier.

Next day switching will be made possible by the upgrading of old IT systems first developed in the 1990s, said Ofgem.

The
 latest figures from the DECC show that 1.3million electricity 
customers and 866,000 gas customers changed supplier in the final three months of 2013.

Industry group Energy UK said it welcomed the move.

Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Shrewd consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts.

Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

If you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year.

Prices are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison to find the best price.
