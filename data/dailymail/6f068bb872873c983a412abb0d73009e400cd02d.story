Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti will begin talks over the possibility of extending his stay at the Santiago Bernabeu in the new year.

The Italian tactician is happy with his current crop of players and is content with life in the Spanish capital, according to Madrid-based newspaper Marca.

Ancelotti, whose current deal expires in 2016, arrived at the European champions at the beginning of the 2013/14 season after leaving Paris Saint-Germain. He led Real Madrid to their 10th European Cup in his first season in charge.

Marca go with the headline 'Where do I need to sign?' to emphasise Ancelotti's desire to stay at the club.

Sport, on the other hand, have decided to focus on Barcelona's aim to sign either Koke or Lars Bender during the summer transfer window.

The Catalan giants are said to be on the lookout for a central midfielder to replace Barcelona legend Xavi.

Barcelona will have to meet Atletico Madrid ace Koke's 60million euros release clause while Bayer Leverkusen's Bender is said to be worth 30m euros.

Mundo Deportivo focus on Barcelona's 'new trident' of forwards. The Spanish newspaper carries quotes from Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar on how they plan to combine as an attacking trio.

Meanwhile in Italy, Filippo Inzaghi has said he hopes to manage AC Milan for the next 20 years.

'Silvio Berlusconi told me he hopes I stay a long time, maybe I will be like Sir Alex Ferguson,' said the former AC Milan striker.
