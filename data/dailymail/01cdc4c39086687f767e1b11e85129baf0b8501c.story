There will be no great explosion of fizz this morning as the Queen names the biggest ship in the entire history of her Royal Navy.

That’s simply because Her Majesty will be doing the honours not with champagne but a bottle of Islay single malt (after all, this thing has been put together in Rosyth).

Yet, in naval clubs up and down the land, the corks will be popping - literally and metaphorically. For today is about much more than a colossal new addition to the fleet. It represents something of a renaissance for our Senior Service.

Ocean-going colossus: Some 10,000 workers from 90 companies at six shipyards have constructed HMS Queen Elizabeth, pictured, which will be able to carry 1,000 troops and 36 F-35 Lightning strike fighters

As HMS Queen Elizabeth does not have a catapult system, jets use the 13 degree ramp to aid take-off, reducing fuel usage and improving their mission range

The giant ship is powered by two bronze propellers,each 22ft in diameter and weighing 33 tons, pushing her to a top speed of 30mph  

At 72,000 tons and 932 feet long, the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier is taller than Nelson’s Column and considerably wider than the M25 at its widest point. She generates enough energy to power Swindon, she can produce 500 tons of fresh water a day — and travel 500 miles a day, too.

Above all, she will be able to deliver 36 F-35 Lightning strike fighters and 1,000 troops from the largest piece of British sovereign territory afloat.

Her sister ship, the Prince of Wales, is already in production, though it has still not been decided whether she will be operational, mothballed or sold. This week, the Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond, described the project as a feat of engineering to match the  London Olympics.

You could say much the same about the price — more than £6 billion for the pair. And that does not include the planes.

These have been the subject of long debates, delays and a costly U-turn in 2012 when the Government switched from a catapult launch system to jump jets.

Nor will they be seen at today’s launch. A flypast using American F-35s is off after an engine fire in the U.S.

The Queen Elizabeth is so large that she will not come down a slipway but ‘float up’ as water floods into her dry dock.

And it will be another two years before she is fully fitted out and ready to leave Rosyth. After sea trials in 2017, she is due to get her first planes in 2018 and to be fully  operational by 2020, with a projected lifespan of 50 years.

Since no photograph can yet do her justice, we have produced this souvenir illustration to mark today’s event.

Thus begins a new era for a service which once ruled the waves but which has had a pretty dismal spell of late. Old salts might trace the low ebb back to 1997 when the Royal Yacht was decommissioned and this ancient maritime nation found itself without a flagship.

Others say that the trouble started in 2005 when the Royal Navy insisted on a politically correct bicentenary of the Battle  of Trafalgar.

The re-enactment of Nelson’s finest hour featured a ‘red’ fleet and a ‘blue’ fleet so as not to upset the French.

In 2007, Britain was humiliated when 15 British sailors and Royal Marines were captured, without a fight, by Iranians in international Gulf waters. Released 13 days later, one of them admitted that he had cried himself to sleep when the Iranians confiscated his iPod.

Two years later, the crew of a Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship simply looked on as a British couple, Paul and Rachel Chandler, were seized from their sailing boat by  Somali pirates.

And all the while, the surface fleet continued to shrink while the Navy was further eclipsed by events in landlocked Afghanistan.

Hence the understandable delight this week as the First Sea Lord, Sir George Zambellas, entertained the other services, politicians, diplomats and defence experts to a dinner in honour of the new carrier at London’s Institute of Directors.

They heard Mr Hammond praise her as ‘a vital message of confidence and capability as we plan for our future prosperity; a formidable deterrent to our foes; a symbol of solidarity with our allies and an advertisement for the Best of British.’

There remains one further challenge: squeezing this behemoth underneath the Forth Bridge and out to sea.

HMS Illustrious, top, the last of the Invincible Class Carriers is dwarfed by the vast HMS Queen Elizabeth next to her at Babcock Marine's Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland

HMS Queen Elizabeth, pictured under the blue crane, is the Royal Navy's biggest ever aircraft carrier and at 65,000 tonnes is three times the size of the 22,000 tonne Illustrious, pictured to the left

The main dry docks at Babcock Marine's Rosyth Dockyard are pictured from the air and show the huge beam of HMS Elizabeth, under the blue crane, compared to the Invincible Class HMS Illustrious. The new £3billion aircraft carrier will be fully fitted out before being brought into full use in 2020

Two workmen look up at the giant hull of HMS Queen Elizabeth during the construction phase. It is due to come into full service in 2020 and will be Britain's biggest ever warship
