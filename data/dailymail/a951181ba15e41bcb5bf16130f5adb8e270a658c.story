The families of many of those who died in a shooting rampage last year at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, gathered on Monday to encourage people to perform an act of kindness on the anniversary of the slayings.

The families also announced the launch of a new website, Mysandyhookfamily.org, to honor the 26 victims in the December 14, 2012, shootings.

The website is intended to create a 'singular place of sharing, communication, and contact with the families of those who lost their lives that day.'

In a tearful procession, representatives from 14 Sandy Hook Elementary School families stood up to say they would light a candle to mark the anniversary.

Never forget: Families of the 26 victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting today announced the launch of a website, MySandyHookFamily.org, as the first anniversary of the Dec. 14 tragedy approaches

Representatives of the group said they hoped those moved by the tragedy would perform an act of kindness in their own communities to honor the 20 children and six adults killed nearly a year ago.

The website brings up a biography and details on charities related to the victim when the user clicks on the victim's name.

'In the midst of our grief we have come to realize that we want our loved ones to be remembered for the lives they lived and how they touched our hearts,' Krista Rekos, mother of slain first grader Jessica Rekos said at a gathering of 14 families Monday. 'We have been uplifted by the support of so many people and we would like to keep that spirit of unity alive in all we do to remember those we so dearly miss.'

'This website is intended to serve as
a singular place of sharing, communication, and contact with the 
families of those who lost their lives that day. MySandyHookFamily.org 
allows us, the 26 families, the opportunity to honor our loved ones in a
way that feels right to each individual family.

'We
ask that you understand that each of us – each family – is unique in 
our own experiences following this tragedy and we each have our own 
voice and perspective. By creating this website, we hope to offer an 
opportunity to communicate with our families and honor our loved ones,  
while at the same time respecting each family’s individual journey and 
unique experiences.'

The families each said they would light a candle on the one-year anniversary Saturday in honor of their loved ones.

There
is also a link to the My Sandy Hook Family Fund, run by Sandy Hook 
resident Rob Accomondo. Accomondo started the fund the day after the 
massacre and has raised more than $1.6 million, all of which has gone 
directly to the families.

Many of the families are still bitter 
at the distribution of money from the largest fund - the Newtown-Sandy 
Hook Community Foundation Inc. The families received $7.7 million out of
what was then an $11.3 million fund.

Not all of the money was 
given to the victims families. The foundation has also no clear plan on 
what to do with the rest of the money.

The
Newtown-Sandy Hook Community Foundation now has more than $12 million 
with about $750,000 raised since the families distribution was made.

In
one of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history, a 20-year-old Newtown 
resident, Adam Lanza, went on the rampage at the elementary school, 
shooting the pupils and school staff dead before turning a gun on 
himself.

The 
shootings shocked the nation and led President Barack Obama to propose a
series of new gun-control measures, including an expansion of federal 
background-check laws. Those efforts were blocked in the U.S. Senate 
after some lawmakers argued the changes would be onerous to law-abiding 
gun owners.

In a report
released last month, state investigators said the gunman acted alone, 
using guns legally purchased by his mother, whom he shot dead before 
driving to the school. His motive and reason for targeting Sandy Hook, a
school he once attended, remain a mystery, the report said.

Earlier
on Monday, Newtown officials, including First Selectman Pat Llodra, 
held a news conference with television reporters to ask for privacy and a
restrained media presence as the anniversary nears

'We
can't choose to not have this horrible thing happen to us. It happened.
We cannot make it un-happen,' Llodra said. 'But we can choose how we 
react to it.

'Please 
respect our need to be alone and to be quiet and to have that personal 
time to continue on our journey of grief in the way that serves us,' she
said.

We 
don't need to be reminded. We don't need to relive it. We live it every 
day. We carry it with us,' said E. Patricia Llodra, Newtown's first 
selectman, at a news conference Monday.

'We
are fully aware of our tragedy so we are trying to say to the world, 
'Please give us the chance so that we can get to that really, healthy, 
happy place that loves children and families and has great schools, and 
we know who we are.'

'We know that that is our destiny. But you need to help us get there by please staying away.'

Local
government officials are urging the media to stay away Saturday, the 
first anniversary of the Dec. 14 shootings that killed 20 children and 
six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School.

'One
of the challenges for us, is that when media is present, some of the 
people that are most vulnerable, who need the most support, won't come,'
said Matt Crebbin, senior Minister for the Newtown Congregational 
Church & coordinator of the Newtown Interfaith Clergy Association.

'We don't want our people to feel and become isolated.'

Just
the presence of news vehicles in the town causes additional stress for a
big population in the town, said Cody Foss Co-Director, Newtown Youth 
Academy.

'Seeing media presence as a reminder of last year is a pretty tough trigger for a lot of people.' Mr. Foss said.

'There
is a sense in this town that we kind of need that day back. And from 
where we are now, we are trying to protect our kids and families and get
some sense of normally back. But we just can't do that with all these 
other triggers and other things that are out of our control.'

Many
of those directly affected by the shooting, including parents of the 
children killed that day, have said they plan to be out of town this 
week. Groups that have used Newtown as a rallying call in advocating for
changes in public policy have also vowed to stay out of Newtown on the 
anniversary, holding events in Washington and other cities instead.

Newtown's
police chief, Michael Kehoe, said the town would have extra police 
officers on duty and that the department's goal would be to encourage an
atmosphere of normalcy.

Llodra said she hoped to fulfill media organizations' request for access while requesting they stay away this week.

'We're
trying to respect the world's interest in us, and we certainly have 
benefited from that interest in many ways,' she said. But, she added, 
'We pay a price when the media is here.'
