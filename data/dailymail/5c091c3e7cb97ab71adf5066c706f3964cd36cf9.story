Having scored with their first shot on target against Chelsea, Burnley have not found the net in 526 minutes since. 

Take two teams without a Premier League win to their name this season – in Burnley’s case one without a goal in almost eight hours of football now – and the outcome at Turf Moor was rather predictable.

Sean Dyche’s side have played 470 minutes since Scott Arfield stunned Chelsea in the opening game of the season here with a strike that ultimately counted for nothing.

The elation of that moment has long since faded with Burnley picking up three points from their opening five games.

Sunderland have fared little better, although they had at least scored five coming into this encounter.

Both teams did their best to improve on those records and there was plenty of effort yesterday but also a distinct lack of craft. 

Both came agonisingly close to that first win in the closing minutes when Burnley substitute Ashley Barnes saw his effort deflected against the bar and Sunderland’s Patrick van Aanholt had a 30-yard shot turned against the post by Tom Heaton.

But neither manager was particularly overjoyed with another draw, even though Dyche remains positive that Burnley will find their way in the top-flight.

Their next two games are against West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City, and that first win cannot come soon enough.

‘League tables are for other people to talk about but if we keep playing like that I’m convinced there are wins around the corner,’ said Dyche.

‘I’m not naïve. I know you have to score goal to win games, but you also got to believe in performance levels and ours are very good. Over time, if you keep putting up those kind of performances it’s my belief that you will win games.

‘Overall we probably edged it. We had one hit the bar and a couple of big penalty shouts, one in the second half against Duke (Lukas Jutkiewicz). Anywhere else on the pitch that’s a foul so it’s got to be given. But it’s tough on for referees, the hardest part of the job is defining those moments.’

Dyche claims Lukas Jutkiewicz (C) could have earned a penalty after a challenge from  Emanuele Giaccherini

Dyche was referring to a collision between Jutkiewicz and Emanuele Giaccherini which was ignored by referee Anthony Taylor. The Italian actually threw himself to the floor far more dramatically, perhaps forgetting that he was in his own penalty box.

Leading the line in the absence of the injured Sam Vokes and Danny Ings, two strikers who contributed 46 goals to Burnley’s promotion campaign last season, Jutkiewicz was a handful throughout.

Wes Brown and John O’Shea had their arms all over him at times, but even that was not enough when he broke away from O’Shea in the second half to force a fine diving save from Mannone.

‘I thought he was top drawer, a real handful,’ added Dyche. ‘If I was a centre-half I wouldn’t have enjoyed playing against him today, that’s for sure.’

Marvin Sordell (C) missed a chance to break the deadlock on his first league start for Burnley

Marvin Sordell, making his first league start for Burnley alongside Jutkiewicz, wasted a great chance as early as the fourth minute when he failed to connect with George Boyd’s pullback, and David Jones drilled another low effort straight at Mannone from 15 yards.

Giaccherini was Sunderland’s most lively player but having failed to trouble Heaton with a 25-yard effort in the first half, his low cross in the second looked destined to present Connor Wickham with a simple tap-in at the far post before Jason Shackell intervened with a marvellous back-heeled clearance.

The match came alive in the dying stages when Lee Cattermole tried to block a shot from Barnes on the edge of the area in the 86th minute and the ball looped over Mannone but came back off the bar.

Then Sunderland were inches away from claiming that elusive victory as they also hit the woodwork in added time.

Van Aanholt played a freekick square across the pitch and when it was passed back to him decided to try his luck from fully 30 yards. Heaton’s view was impeded as it flew through a crowded box but he touched the ball against the post and was then relieved to see it deflect against his body and away to safety.

Events at Newcastle will no doubt ease the pain for Sunderland, but Gus Poyet wore the look of a manager who is growing increasingly frustrated with their indifferent start.

‘We played okay, but okay is not enough in the Premier League,’ said Poyet. ‘We played the way I want for three or four minutes every now and then but not consistently enough.

‘It was a great opportunity to take the three points. I’ll take a clean sheet today but nothing else.'
