Greg Dyke has labelled England's refereeing as 'world class' after Howard Webb received his first appointment of the World Cup.

Four years after taking charge of the final in South Africa, Rotherham official Webb's first duty in Brazil will be to oversee the Group C encounter between Colombia and Ivory Coast.

Webb will be joined by long-time assistants Mike Mullarkey and Darren Cann for the match in Brasilia, ahead of which FA chairman Dyke sung the praises of refereeing standards in England.

England's number one: Webb has taken charge of some of the most important games in recent years

And despite criticism of refereeing in the Premier League from the likes of Jose Mourinho, Dyke spoke of his pride at the quality of England's referees.

'Howard Webb, Mike Mullarkey and Darren Cann will be England's refereeing trio in Brazil and are rightly regarded as among the best in the world,' he said.

'Howard has taken charge of the biggest games around - not least the 2010 World Cup final, when he was ably assisted by Mike and Darren.

Challenge: Webb had a difficult task to keep control of a feisty World Cup final in South Africa in 2010

'It is not only Howard, 'Mark Clattenburg just missed out on selection having taken charge of the London 2012 Olympic men's final at Wembley along with Stephen Child and Simon Beck.

'There is a good depth to our leading referees' list.'

And FA chairman Dyke reserved some special praise for female assistant referee Sian Massey.

'Sian Massey's emergence as a top Premier League assistant referee was furthered by her work at the FIFA Women's Under-17 World Cup in March which followed her appointment for last year's UEFA Women's Euro final in Sweden,' he said.

Respect: Webb has been praised for his friendly approach towards players - something FIFA value

'At grassroots level, we recognise the need to encourage more referees and also to retain those who give their valuable time to the national game.

'This refereeing excellence is not a new phenomenon. No country has had more men take charge of the World Cup final than the FA's four. English refereeing is world class.'

Head girl: Sian Massey was also the subject of praise from Dyke for her rise up through the men's game
