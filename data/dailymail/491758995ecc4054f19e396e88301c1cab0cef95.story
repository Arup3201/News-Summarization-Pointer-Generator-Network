A man who walked off a Qantas flight after he realised an asylum seeker was on board being deported is taking the airline to a tribunal because the airline banned him from flying after the incident.

Paul Leary, 51, decided to leave the February 2 flight from Melbourne to Darwin before the flight took off, after an asylum seeker advocate on the plane began protesting the deportation.

Mr Leary learned he was on the same flight as a 25-year-old Tamil asylum seeker, known as Puvaneethan, when he arrived at Melbourne Airport to see advocates handing out flyers, and when the female protester refused to sit down as the plane prepared for take-off.

Paul Leary, 51, made a personal decision to leave the flight he had boarded from Melbourne to Darwin on February 2 but has now been banned from flying with Qantas

Mr Leary said he and a colleague felt faced with a 'moral dilemma.' His female colleague decided she was not comfortable being on the plane and Mr Leary stood by her and also decided not to fly.

‘We couldn’t have been politer. We were travelling for business, we’ve both got executive roles in the organisation we work for… we were not aggravating or inciting other people,’ Mr Leary told Daily Mail Australia.

‘The protester was probably 20 seats behind us.’

Mr Leary and his colleague pressed the assistance light above their seats and a Qantas stewardess came over to speak with them.

‘My colleague courageously and in a polite gesture stood up and pressed the call button. When the Qantas steward came over she indicated she was not comfortable with what was going on,’ Mr Leary explained.

They were told to wait and eventually a federal police officer came aboard the aircraft. Mr Leary’s colleague told the stewardess she wanted to leave.

‘I stood up and said “can you explain what’s going on?” and they said the woman is protesting and we are going to have a discussion and I said “look I think I’ll get off too”,’ Mr Leary said.

When he and his colleague were back inside the airport the federal police took their details but no one from Qantas informed them at that point of any kind of flight ban.

It wasn’t until Mr Leary was returning from Darwin four days later after catching a flight with a different airline that he attempted to return to Melbourne with Qantas and was told he was subject to a no-fly ban.

Paul Leary was issued with this 'no fly notification' after he walked off a flight from Melbourne to Darwin which was carrying an asylum seeker thought to have been taken for deportation 

‘A manager came over and said “you are involved in a security review and won’t be flying today”,’ Mr Leary recalled.

He was told to email Qantas security to find out more but when he did that straight away he claims he did not hear anything back.

After six hours he managed to catch a flight with a different airline.

‘I still didn't hear anything by Monday and the only response I got was to submit a customer care complaint,’ he added.

After Mr Leary submitted his complaint he then received a formal letter on February 16 informing him of his ban.

‘As a result of your actions on board QF838 from MELDRW on 2nd February, we have decided to issue you a No Fly Notification - Until Further Notice while the incident is investigated,’ Qantas wrote.

‘Your actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated by the Qantas Group or the Jetstar Group.

‘A Qantas Customer Care Representative will make contact with you upon completion of the investigation to advise you of the outcome,’ the airline said.

Mr Leary said he has not been able to find out what the review process entails or if Qantas are going to refund the cost of his flights to his employer.

Mr Leary and his colleague have also been banned from flying with Jetstar and Qantas affiliates 

Flyers were handed out at Melbourne airport asking the public to save asylum seeker Puvaneethan from torture

‘It’s like a Kafkaesque situation where you just find out the result at the end,’ he said.

The letter spells out how Mr Leary cannot ‘travel on any flight operated by a member of the Qantas Group or the Jetstar Group or travel on any codeshare flight operated by another airline (including Emirates) that has a Qantas or Jetstar flight number, such as “QF” or “JQ”, on your ticket’.

Mr Leary has complained to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal's human rights division that the ban discriminates against him on the basis of his political belief.

His female colleague is also in the process of filing a complaint.

‘Myself and my colleague didn't want to do anything, we thought Qantas are a big company with a good reputation I’ll find out the facts and it will all go away but it hasn’t.

‘If alternatively there was no asylum seeker on the plane and I decided to accompany my colleague off the plane because she was ill I don’t think I’d be banned.

‘So the only reason I can see for this ban is my political beliefs… I’m not a known activist, I never have been. I’m in my fifties, I’m not a radical.’

A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia there was a delay in issuing the no fly notification to Mr Leary which is why he did not receive it prior to his next flight.  

'A number of passengers were identified as being involved in the on board incident, causing the flight to be delayed by almost an hour,' Qantas said.

'A ‘no fly notification’ has been issued by Qantas to those passengers while the incident is investigated by the AFP.  As the incident is under investigation, it is not appropriate to comment further.'
