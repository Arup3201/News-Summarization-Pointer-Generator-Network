India's power supply has been finally been restored after a two-day blackout left half the country without electricity. 

About 620 million people were left without electricity after India's northern, eastern and north-eastern grids failed yesterday afternoon.

The power failure caused havoc - hundreds of miners were trapped 
underground in the eastern state of West Bengal when the lifts failed, 
metro services were stopped temporarily in the capital and hundreds of 
trains were held up nationwide.

Power minister Veerappa Moily told reporters that by this morning power had been fully restored across the country.

Mr
Moily, who took over the top power position yesterday, said an 
investigation into the crisis had been launched and he did not want to 
point fingers or speculate about the cause.

Other officials said the blackout might have been the result of states drawing too much power from the grid.

Some
analysts dismissed that explanation, saying that if overdrawing power 
from the grid caused this kind of collapse, it would happen all the 
time.

In recent years India's demand for electricity has soared as its economy has grown.

But it faces problems as its power infrastructure struggles to keep up with its growing needs.

Analyst predict that unless there is a huge investment in the energy sector, the country will see many more power failures which could jeopardise its future as as a superpower.

About 620 million people were left 
without electricity after India's northern, eastern and north-eastern 
grids failed yesterday afternoon.

It was the second massive outage in 
as many days, coming just after the country had recovered from Monday's 
failure of the northern grid, which left 370 million people powerless.

Electricity workers struggled 
throughout the day yesterday to return power to the 20 affected states, 
restoring most of the system in the hours after the crash.

The Confederation of Indian Industry 
said the two outages cost business hundreds of millions of pounds, 
though they did not affect the financial centre of Mumbai and the global
outsourcing powerhouses of Bangalore and Hyderabad in the south.

The group demanded the widespread 
reform of India's power sector, which has been unable to keep up with 
soaring demand for electricity as the economy has expanded and Indians 
grow more affluent and energy hungry.

The power minister cautioned there 
would be no quick solution to the power crisis, saying the government is
looking at immediate and longer term measures to address power 
scarcity.

Part of the problem is that India 
relies on coal for more than half its power generation and the coal 
supply is controlled by a near state monopoly that is widely considered a
shambles.

A huge traffic jam was witnessed near Karkardi More in the capital as traffic signals were not functioning following a massive power failure at northern grid

A recent survey showed nearly all the coal-fuelled plants had less than seven days of coal stock, a 
critical level, and many power plants were running below capacity, 
according to Samiran Chakraborty, head of research at Standard 
Chartered, a financial services company.

Government bureaucracy has made it difficult to bring more plants online.

In addition, vast amounts of power 
bleeds out of India's antiquated distribution system or is pirated 
through unauthorised wiring.

Farmers, with a guarantee of free 
electricity that is driving many state electric boards to bankruptcy, 
have no incentive to conserve energy.

The power deficit was worsened this 
year by a weak monsoon that lowered hydroelectric generation, spurred 
farmers to use pumps to irrigate their fields long after the rains would
normally have come, and kept temperatures higher, keeping air 
conditioners and fans running longer.
