Steven Gerrard's sending-off was so quick that the clock on the Anfield scoreboard was stuck on 00.00 when he was given his marching orders at the start of the second half. The official time referee Martin Atkinson produced the red card was after just 38 seconds.

The sending off was so quick that Gerrard became the subject of jokes and virals on social media, including a mock heat map of his brief time on the pitch.

Pele gets red carpet treatment

Very little unites these two bitter rivals but Brazil legend Pele got a standing ovation from both sets of fans when he appeared on the pitch at half-time, posing for photos with Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre and club ambassador Kenny Dalglish. The great man was on the pitch longer than Steven Gerrard!

Louis van Gaal revealed that he offered his team the chance to revert to the three-man defence they have used on previous occasions in order to match Liverpool’s 3-4-3 formation. ‘I said that we can play with three defenders or shall we continue with 4-3-3?’ he said. It appears they chose the latter.

Fans rescue Super Mario

Mario Balotelli threatened to add to the heated atmosphere at Anfield after he was tackled into the advertising boards by Chris Smalling. But before he could square up to the defender, Balotelli was helpfully restrained by two Liverpool fans.

Wayne Rooney expressed his regret at not handing Juan Mata the chance of a hat-trick when United won a penalty. The striker said on Twitter: ‘Very happy tonight. Fans were amazing. @juanmata8 great goals. Should have let him take penalty.’ Rooney’s miss saw his Anfield goal drought stretch to more than 10 years. The last time he found the net there was in January 2005.
