Steve McManaman has defended Brendan Rodgers’ decision to rest seven players for Liverpool’s Champions League clash at Real Madrid.

Captain Steven Gerrard was left out of the starting XI at the Bernabeu along with Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli, Coutinho and Glen Johnson all on the bench, while Dejan Lovren did not even make the matchday squad.

But McManaman, who played for both Liverpool and Real Madrid, says Rodgers has not picked a weakened team for the game.

The Liverpool starting XI before the match... it is missing some big names in Steven Gerrard and co.

Speaking ahead of Tuesday's game on ITV Sport, McManaman said: ‘I don’t think it's a B-team. I agree if you drop Steven Gerrard and Raheem Sterling you’re dropping Liverpool's best players.

‘But I think players like Kolo Toure and Lucas, they deserve the chance to try and star in this team.’

Liverpool lost 3-0 to Real in their last game in the Champions League, are currently third in Group B and will face an uphill task should they be beaten heavily.

Rodgers’ side - who are seventh in the Premier League - face Chelsea at the weekend.
