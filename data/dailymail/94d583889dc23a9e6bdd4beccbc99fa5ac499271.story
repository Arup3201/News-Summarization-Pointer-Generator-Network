The pub owner who beat Gordon Ramsay in a multi-million pound High Court battle has told how the celebrity chef ruined his life.

Gary Love has spoken out for the first time after defeating the celebrity chef in a case which centred on Ramsay's claim that his estranged father-in-law Chris Hutcheson had effectively forged his signature to commit him to a 25-year contract for a London gastropub. 

But Mr Justice Morgan poured scorn on Ramsay's claim that he had been duped over the use of a signature making machine to sign the agreement, calling his evidence 'entirely implausible' and leaving him facing a £10million rent bill.

Gordon Ramsay (pictured with wife Tana) lost a £10million court case this week when a judge rejected claims he had been duped over the agreement to guarantee a gastropub’s £640,000 annual rent

Mr Love owned the York and Albany pub, near Regent's Park, when Hutcheson committed Ramsay to personally guarantee the £640,000 a year lease on the premises in 2007.

But in 2010 Ramsay sacked Hutcheson, who was chief executive of his companies, claiming he had been secretly siphoning off money from the business and subsequently lodged action against Love.

Mr Love said: 'It completely destroyed my life and my family's life. Everything was put on hold.

'He made my life a nightmare with an entirely spurious claim in an attempt to wriggle out of a loss making business, whereas if he had just asked me I could have done what he does on the TV with Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.

Gary Love, the owner of the pub, has now criticised the chef for bringing the lengthy court case

'I could very easily tell him why his business is losing £4million a year.'

The court heard that Ramsay had lined up the property for his star chef Angela Hartnett and before the agreement was signed he had met up with Love to discuss the deal.

The film director said that Ramsay had ruined his business and family life, not least because he had put a legal 'notice' against the York and Albany property to alert potential buyers that there was a legal battle surrounding ownership of the property.

He said: 'My family and I had arranged to sell up in the UK as we were moving to LA to pursue opportunities.

'We needed to sell the property to provide working capital for my new projects in LA but the notice Ramsay had placed on it meant we couldn't do that.

'The children were already booked into schools in California. I couldn't not go there so we had to go and launch a business without funds. It was a nightmare.'

The court heard that Hutcheson, who knew that Love would sue him if Ramsay won in court, initially helped Love prepare his case against before the pair subsequently fell out. 

Since Ramsay parted ways with Hutcheson, the pair have been at loggerheads in and out of court with the chef saying he felt like a 'performing monkey' and his wife Tana accusing her father of a 'distressing fraud' in the High Court.

The High Court had heard that Hutcheson used a 'ghost writer' machine to put Ramsay's signature on a series of contracts but the celebrity chef claimed he did not have his consent to do this.

But Ramsay's secretary Jennifer Aves-Elliott revealed that, after Hutcheson had been fired in 2010, she had told Gordon and Tana Ramsay about her concerns about the use of the ghost writing machine.

The judge noted  that Ramsay had never mentioned this when he had subsequently taken legal action against Hutcheson the following year despite the apparent significance of this. 

In his judgement Mr Justice Morgan said: 'Mr Ramsay knew, long before the entry into the agreement for lease and the lease of the premises, that the machine was routinely used to place his signature on legal documents.'

The dispute was over the York & Albany, where Ramsay opened a restaurant near Regent’s Park in London

The judge added: 'I do not accept his evidence to the contrary. I find that when Mr Hutcheson committed Mr Ramsay to the guarantee in the lease of the premises, Mr Hutcheson was acting within the wide general authority conferred on him by Mr Ramsay at all times until Mr Hutcheson's dismissal in October 2010.

'Mr Ramsay may now regret the transaction in relation to the premises. He may particularly regret his involvement as a guarantor. He may consider that Mr Hutcheson did a bad deal.

Ramsay claimed his estranged father-in-law Chris Hutcheson had effectively forged his signature to commit him to a 25-year contract at the gastropub

'However, on any finding, he is not able to say that Mr Hutcheson exceeded his authority in any respect. Mr Ramsay - acting through his agent Mr Hutcheson - is bound by the guarantee in the lease of the premises.'

Mr Love said of learning about the victory: 'My 50th birthday occurred during the middle of the trial. My wife had booked a special surprise family celebration for me in a secret location at Big Sur. I had to miss it. We are planning something else now, and that also will be a surprise.'

Ramsay is now facing estimated court costs alone of £1.6million and was also told this week that his legal team had been refused permission to appeal.

The celebrity chef's restaurant empire fell £6.4million into the red last June, driven by one-off costs of £9million, with £6.7million relating to the York & Albany lease and £2million in legal expenses.

Of Ramsay, Mr Love added: 'I think he was very badly advised, and I hope that both of our families can now put this behind us and get on with our lives. If he rings me up, I will tell him what he needs to do to run the restaurant at a profit.

'My solicitor Philip Cohen's work cracked the case. On the face of it, Ramsay had an open and shut case of his signature being forged on an important legal document.

'It was through Philip's relentless work in dragging out other documents of Ramsay that we were able to show that the signature on the personal guarantee was not a one-off.'

Mr Cohen, of Jeffrey Green Russell, said: 'I think people in public positions like Ramsay should set a better example. What is so worrying is that Ramsay could have got away with it.'
