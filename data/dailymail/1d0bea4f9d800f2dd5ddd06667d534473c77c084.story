Dragon's’ Den entrepreneur James Caan was accused of ‘total hypocrisy’ yesterday after he insisted parents should not help their children get jobs – but failed to mention he has employed both his daughters.

On his first day as Nick Clegg’s adviser on social mobility, Mr Caan insisted that job prospects should not depend on ‘who you know rather than what you can do’.

He suggested children should be encouraged to make their own  way in life and that their parents should step in only if they were in serious difficulty.

However, Mr Caan, 52, a private equity
and recruitment tycoon and a former panellist on the BBC’s Dragons’ 
Den, made no mention of the fact that his daughter Hanah has held three 
positions in his various ventures.

Miss Caan, 25, who describes herself 
as ‘sort of like Maggie Thatcher meets Paris Hilton’ on Twitter, spent a
year working at her father’s private equity firm Hamilton Bradshaw.

Since 2010, she has been on the board 
of trustees of the James Caan Foundation, which helps fund building 
projects in Pakistan among other causes.

And in May last year, she started as 
an adviser with the government-backed Start-Up Loans Company, of which 
her father is chairman.

It also emerged that his older daughter Jemma, 26, works for a recruitment firm he part-owns.

Later, Mr Caan sought to defend his 
daughters’ appointments but admitted that, like any parent, he has an 
‘innate’ sense he should help his children in to work.

Tory MP Brian Binley, a member of the 
Commons Business Select Committee, accused Mr Caan of being ‘totally 
hypocritical’, adding: ‘If parents aren’t there to give all the help 
they can to their children then I don’t know what they are there for.’

Downing Street suggested David Cameron
does not agree with Mr Caan’s advice. ‘His view is every parent wants 
what’s best for their children,’ a spokesman said.

In response to the furore, Mr Caan, 
who has been chosen to lead the Government’s Opening Doors campaign to 
encourage businesses to have ‘open and fair’ recruitment processes, 
insisted both his daughters were treated the same as other applicants to
his companies.

He said: ‘I absolutely believe that 
parents should encourage their children to explore their own 
opportunities. The fact is that parents will always have the innate 
feeling to help their children into jobs. I’m no different.

‘In my own situation, my eldest 
daughter Jemma spent four years of pursuing many jobs to establish 
herself on her own career path. More recently over the last six months 
she joined a recruitment company that I have an investment in.

‘Despite my involvement she still had 
to go through a rigorous recruitment process with a number of different 
candidates and demonstrate her own abilities.

‘When my daughter Hanah... graduated 
she volunteered in my then start-up business Hamilton Bradshaw. She 
later submitted her CV and interviewed for a graduate internship 
position within the business to enable her to follow a formal process.’

Speaking on Sky News today, he added: 'I find some parents have a very clear idea about what they want their children to do, but it is also important to understand what the child wants to do.'
