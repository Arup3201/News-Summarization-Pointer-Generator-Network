As Sherlock Holmes, his intelligence is the only weapon he needs.

But for his latest role, Benedict Cumberbatch has found himself armed with something a little more unwieldy.

These shots show the 38-year-old as an armour-clad Richard III, brandishing a sword and charging on horseback into the Battle of Bosworth of 1485.

Leading man: Benedict Cumberbatch as Richard III, filming for BBC2 series The Hollow Crown

Horseback: The dramatic scenes involving the 38-year-old actor were filmed in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire

More often seen in a deerstalker hat when he plays Holmes, he seems keen to embrace a more active role.

Richard III is traditionally depicted with a hunchback. 

But Cumberbatch’s portrayal suggests producers have taken note of recent scans of his newly-discovered remains, which found his spine only had a slight deformity that would not have affected his prowess in battle.

The dramatic scenes were filmed in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, for BBC2 series The Hollow Crown, which is based on William Shakespeare’s history plays. 

Experience: Cumberbatch learned to ride a horse for the 2011 Hollywood version of War Horse

Two years away: The Hollow Crown - which will consist of four separate films - is not expected to air until 2016

New show: Cumberbatch will star in The Hollow Crown, which is based on William Shakespeare’s history plays 

He will be reunited with Sherlock actor Andrew Scott, the detective’s nemesis Moriarty, who plays the role of King Louis XI of France.

Another co-star from the hit series, Dr Watson actor Martin Freeman, has already played Richard III on stage in the West End this year.

Cumberbatch learned to ride a horse for the 2011 Hollywood version of War Horse, directed by Steven Spielberg.

At the time, he said he had a ‘near miss’ when his horse reared up and almost fell backwards on top of him.

Also in: The Hollow Crown will also star Dame Judi Dench (left) and Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville (right)

He said: ‘I thought it was game over. I was charging around on him, show-jumping and picking up stuff and dropping it off.

‘I think I just went for it too much and accidently gave him a confusing instruction, kicking him as well as reining him back. He thought I meant for him to stand up and the next thing I know he started going.

‘I made the classic mistake of pulling on the reins to keep my seat and he started to go backwards, which is really dangerous.’

The Hollow Crown - which will consist of four separate films - is not expected to air until 2016. It will also star Dame Judi Dench, 79, and Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville, 50.
