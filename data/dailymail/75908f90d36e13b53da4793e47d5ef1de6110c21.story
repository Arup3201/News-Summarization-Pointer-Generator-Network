North Korea today released a bizarre video of their military dogs attacking an effigy of an enemy minister and again threatened to attack their neighbours.

The animals savage a model of South Korean defence minister Kim Kwan-Jin in the propaganda clip shown on state television.

In the video, the military dogs can also be seen jumping through a flaming hole as they are put through their paces in training.

It was released as the US delayed an intercontinental ballistic missile test planned for next week amid fears it will be misinterpreted by Pyongyang.

British foreign secretary William Hague today warned of the 'danger of miscalculation' by Kim Jong-un's regime which has worked itself up into a 'frenetic state of rhetoric'.

In the new propaganda video troops can also be seen using the South Korean defence minister's face as target practice.

At the very end of the clip the effigy is destroyed with a rocket launcher.

It is unclear when and where the video, released by North Korea's official news agency KCNA, was filmed.

An unidentified soldier warns that they are ready to attack their neighbour as soon as the order is given.

'On
the Korean peninsula, it is not a matter of whether we will have a war 
or not but whether it will take place today or tomorrow,' he said.

'This
is a situation like being on the eve of a big explosion. Every minute, 
every second counts. We are right now set to march, once the order is 
given.'

The claim follows weeks of ever-increasing threats from the pariah state who claim to have missiles capable of hitting the US.
