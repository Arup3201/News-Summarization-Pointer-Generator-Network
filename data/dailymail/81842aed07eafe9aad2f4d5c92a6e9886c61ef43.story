A woman has died moments after giving birth to quadruplets conceived through IVF.

Erica Morales, 36, and her husband Carlos underwent fertility treatment in a desperate attempt to conceive to complete their family.

Finally, on Thursday, Mrs Morales delivered three girls and one boy at Banner Good Samaritan Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, one month before the due date.

Just hours later she passed away before she got a chance to meet her children: Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica.

Delivery: Their children Carlos Jr, Paisley, Tracy, and Erica were born on Thursday, one month premature

Doctors have launched an instant investigation to determine a cause of death which is as yet unknown.

The children are all alive and healthy.

On Tuesday Mrs Morales went into hospital with a swollen foot and tests showed her blood pressure to be 190/90.

She wrote on Facebook: 'He said I have to get admitted until delivery. It's been down lower today but it's too late.

'He will keep me and he ordered some labs.

'He will push deliver up or stall it to to 34 weeks. I'm 31 tomorrow. He said I did phenomenal. A poster child for quads. He wish they could all go this way but this last part we have to do it carefully because u can stroke out with bad blood pressure. I'm sure I won't but he looking at how to finish things.'

After explaining that it would definitely be a premature birth, Mrs Morales added: 'I always want more but sometimes you just have to sit back and thank God for blessing up to this point and put it fully in his hands. Thanks for the prayers and everything else.'

Tributes have flooded in for Mrs Morales, a real estate broker from Memphis, Tennessee, who married Carlos in October 2007.

Excitement: They shared this picture on Facebook as they neared their February due date this year

Medical attention: Days before, Erica was rushed to hospital with a blood pressure of 190/90

Her cousin and best friend Christina Todman told Fox 10: 'This is all they wanted, to have this family, to make their family complete. It's like that fairytale story.'

After conceiving, the couple registered the planned birth and bought everything needed for the nursery to welcome their children home.

'It is so hard to know she fought so hard for her children. She will never get to brush their hair, hold their hand, watch them get married, none of that will ever happen for her,' Mrs Morales' cousin Nicole Todman told Fox 10.

'She never got to hold them, she never got to see them.

'We'll have to remember her, we'll have to tell her kids who she was, we'll have to make sure they know how wonderful a person she was, how loving and how much she wanted them, and how much she loved them.'

Hopes and dreams: Friends said Erica (left) was so excited to have children. She died before she met them

So happy: The couple lived together in Phoenix, Arizona. Erica hailed from Memphis, Tennessee

Nicole Todman has set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for Mr Morales, who now faces bringing up four children on his own.

The page reads: 'My best friend and her husband Carlos have tried for the last few years to have a baby and with their Dr's help they were blessed with not 1 but 4 beautiful children, but with that blessing came the most unimaginable tragedy my best friend was lost. 

'The expense of raising 4 children alone is quite daunting for any middle class family now the with the loss of Erica's income her husband will need all the help he can get. 

'This is an extremely emotional time, Erica's passing is tramatic and my goal is to help ease the financial worry as much as possible so every dollar helps if it's $1 or $1000 it will all be used to provide for the beautiful babies Erica fought so hard to have and in the end gave her life for.'
