There are lots of ways for supporters to show loyalty to their club.

Some go for a tattoo, others simply purchase club merchandise, but 55-year-old Tottenham fan Gary Lane has gone one better (or worse depending on your point of view) and changed his name to Gary White Hart Lane, in honour of the club's home ground.

Mr White Hart Lane has been going to Spurs matches for 40 years and said the name change was just a 'bit of banter'.

The supporter, whose house is decked out with Tottenham memorabilia, said the  change was  'a bit of banter'

Explaining the decision, he said: 'I’d been going for so long and my surname was already Lane. And I like a bit of banter. I know a lot of people at Spurs, some of them with seats up there.

'That’s what happens when you’ve been going for 40 years. When I tell people my full name on the phone they can crack up.

'But if it’s an Arsenal or Chelsea fan they can get the hump. And when I told my mum I’d changed it, she nearly fell over.'
