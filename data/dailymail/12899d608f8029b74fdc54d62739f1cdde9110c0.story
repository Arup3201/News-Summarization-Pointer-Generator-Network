Police have conducted a dramatic bedside interview with the state trooper critically injured in the Poconos sniper shootings, and have cleared him of having an affair with the sole suspect's sister-in-law.

Trooper Alex Douglass insisted he does not even know Melissa Frein, the wife of fugitive Eric Frein's older brother, a source close to the investigation told MailOnline exclusively.

Police had earlier said the two — who live less than half a mile apart in Olyphant, Pennsylvania — may have known each other and that Eric Frein, who is being sought after 15 days on the run, may have thought they were having an affair.

'Douglass said he had not even met her,' said the source. 'Of course we don't know what Eric Frein believed.'

Cops hunting Eric Frein hope Douglass's denial will put to rest rumors that have swept the Poconos that he was involved with Melissa. 

Deputy police commander Lt. Col. George Bivens reacted with annoyance at questions about the alleged affair during an hour-long press briefing on Friday.

He said Douglass, who was shot below the waist, was 'troubled' by the focus on his private life.

Douglass, 31, remains critically injured in serious but stable condition following the September 12 shooting which killed his colleague, father-of-two Corporal Bryon Dickson, 38.

If Frein had believed the trooper was involved with his sister-in-law, it could help explain why he drove 25 miles to the Blooming Grove police barracks to carry out his deadly attack rather than pick a target closer to home.

Yesterday the FBI, along with state troopers, continued the manhunt for Eric Frein in a wooded area at Buck Hill Falls in Barrett Township Pennsylvania 

But police believe he picked Blooming Grove because it is isolated and allowed him to hide in the woods to shoot, whereas other police stations are closer to areas of population. They insist that it is mere coincidence that one of the shot men lives just a stone's throw from his brother.

Early in the investigation cops 'aggressively interviewed' Melissa Frein as rumors of the affair circulated. 'We have investigated the rumor of the affair thoroughly after we learned about it, Pennsylvania Sate police spokesman Trooper Tom Kelly told MailOnline earlier this week. 'There is no truth to the affair.

'We used thorough investigative techniques and questioned Melissa Frein extensively. She denied it and we do not believe she is being deceptive.'

It is understood that Melissa Frein passed a polygraph test which helped police reach the conclusion she was not involved with Trooper Douglass.

Melissa is married to Frein's older brother Michael. Eric Frein was best man at their 2007 wedding at St. Joseph Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Melissa Frein has not returned MailOnline calls for comment.

Bivens called Frein, a survivalist who is said to harbor a deep grudge against law enforcement an 'assassin' during Friday's briefing.

Addressing Frein personally, Bivens said: 'Eric, as I told you last week, you are a coward.

'Your actions have caused tremendous disruption to an innocent community while you try to hide from us.

'We are not intimidated and we will not leave. We have a clear mission with specific objectives — protect the community, find you and bring you to justice.'

Cops have now commandeered another abandoned building — known locally just as 'The Mansion' high in the woods off Snow Hill Road. The building, deep in the woods where Frein is believed to be hiding has an airstrip, allowing police helicopters and planes to use it as a base.

Bivens said police believe Frein may have a radio and could be monitoring press reports of the massive manhunt that has consumed hundreds of thousands of police manhours and consumed Canadensis and surrounding areas in the picturesque Poconos.

Police have said they have had Frein, 31, cornered in a five-square-mile area of dense forest in rugged countryside south of Canadensis. But they have had no sighting of their quarry since late Tuesday afternoon.

Before that they have said he has approached the perimeter of their search area, staying just far enough away that officers could not get a clear shot at him. They say dogs flushed him out at one stage but he was far enough away to flee.

Bivens said he believes the search has now become a game for the military simulation fan. To him, It's a game — a war game if you like,' the top cop said.

On Saturday the Philadelphia Inquirer  reported that cops had discovered a jacket they believe belongs to Frein in the woods, along with protein bar wrappers.

The previous day, the same paper said sources had told it cops had discovered bombmaking equipment in Frein's parents' home — a claim that Bivens implicitly accepted — and that Frein had tried to call his parents on September 18 and the 'ping' from his cellphone had helped cops locate him.

Bivens also revealed that Frein had bought equipment that would help him build a bunker in the woods. However he said the intensive search had failed to discover that bunker.

Heavily-armed officers with combat gear and night vision have spent days looking through the woods 

He also said that searches of a computer that Frein used had shown that he had been planning the attack for at least two years. He said the computer showed he had researched how to avoid police manhunts, law enforcement technology and survival skills.

Bivens told reporters: 'I suspect he wants a fight with state police but I suspect that involves hiding and running not a face to face confrontation — trying to take a shot from a concealed location as he has in the past.'

Police have previously said they found soiled diapers and a rare brand of Serbian cigarettes in the woods. Survivalist material found in Frein's parents home advise the wearing of diapers to allow someone to stay in place for extended periods.

Frein is known to be obsessed with Serbia, a country he has visited at least once. He was a member of Istocni Vuk — which translates to Eastern Wolves — a military simulation team which reenacts battles from the Yugoslav civil wars of the 1990s.

Despite police assurances that Frein is contained in an area bounded by Snow Hill Road and Bear Town Road south of Canadensis, they continue to search other areas.

Around 11 p.m. on Friday night a helicopter with a bright blinking light flew over woods a few hundred yards west of the search area. Suddenly the light was extinguished and the chopper continued to fly in darkness as a convoy of heavily armed police sped to the site

'They soon came back, obviously having found nothing,' a man who watched the scene unfold told MailOnline.

Earlier the same day hundreds of police descended on the abandoned Inn at Buck Hill Falls, four miles north of the main search site and spent more than half a day in an intensive search of the 400-room property and its grounds.

Frein is known to be acquainted with the crumbling hulk of a building, which has become a hangout spot for bored local teens since its closure in 1991.
