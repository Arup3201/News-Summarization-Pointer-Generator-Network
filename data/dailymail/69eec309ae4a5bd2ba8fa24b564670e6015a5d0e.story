This is the first picture of the woman accused of trying to kill a newborn baby girl by hurling her down a 50ft rubbish chute.

Iraqi born Jaymin Abdulrahman, 24, appeared in court today charged with attempted murder.

The six-day-old tot was found by police officers inside a bin at the back of flats in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, at 6.30pm on Saturday.

The baby plunged 50ft from the fifth floor down a rubbish chute, which led to a refuse collection area where she was found shortly after being reported missing.

Yesterday the baby was still fighting for life but was 'not expected to survive', a court heard.Officers rushed to the flats after a 999 call was made reporting a missing child.

Police officers discovered the tot in the green bin at the bottom of the waste chute and arrested Iraqi-born Abdulrahman on suspicion of attempted murder.

Abdulrahman faced a single charge of attempted murder of a
potential victim aged under one year old.

Wearing
a black headscarf and purple dress, she sobbed throughout the 15-minute
hearing as details of the charges against her were read out.

The case was committed to appear before Wolverhampton Crown Court on September 20.

Mrs Abdulrahman was refused bail and remanded in custody.

As she was led down to the cells a woman in the public gallery clapped her hands and shouted 'die you bitch'.

Prosecutor Kelly Crowe said the baby remained in a critical condition at Birmingham Children’s hospital yesterday.

The baby was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she was treated for serious injuries

She said: 'The baby is critically ill in hospital and the prognosis is not good and the baby is not expected to survive.'

Husband
Mohammed Abdulrahman, 32, who had been arrested on suspicion of 
assisting an offender, has been released on bail pending further 
enquiries.

Officers had been called to a flat in Wolverhampton, at about 6.30pm to a report of a missing child.

The injured baby was subsequently found during a search of the ground-floor refuse collection area.

On Monday residents expressed their shock at the incident. Nora Donnelly, 49, said: 'On Saturday night there were about five police cars and two ambulances at the front door.

'It’s a real shock to have something like that happen around here.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
