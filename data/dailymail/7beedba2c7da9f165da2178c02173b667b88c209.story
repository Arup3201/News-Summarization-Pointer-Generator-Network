'Utter rubbish': Lauren Moyes has left Twitter after she began trending following mischievous rumours that Wilfried Zaha called 'silly' and his agent said were 'not true at all'

Zaha has been left out of the Red Devils' squad for several matches, including last night's 1-1 draw with Shaktar Donetsk in Ukraine.

Before the Champions League match he wrote: 'Silly rumours. #childish', which has now been retweeted more than 1,600 times.

His agent told the Daily Star claims he was having an affair with Moyes' daughter is 'absolute rubbish' and 'not true at all'.

Message: Wilfried has used his official Twitter account to take on those spreading rumours about him and David Moyes' teenage daughter

The 20-year-old is considered one of England's top football talents, having moved to Old Trafford from Crystal Palace over the summer.

Despite being signed by Sir Alex Ferguson he was expected to be firmly part of Mr Moyes' first team plans.

He played in United's Community Shield win over Wigan in August but has not played since, with rumours circulating that he may be shipped out on loan.

In recent days some fans have blamed this on his love life.

Nobody from Manchester United was available for comment this morning.
