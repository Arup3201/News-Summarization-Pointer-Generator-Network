He won plaudits from press and public alike for his winning ways during his tour of Chile and Brazil and crowned a successful summer by turning the Invictus Games into a national triumph.

Now Prince Harry, 30, has been named the nation's favourite royal - beating the Queen into second place and the Duke and Duchess Cambridge into third and fourth respectively.

Also proving popular is Prince George who, despite being just a year old, took sixth place with the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles tied in fifth.

Prince Popular: Prince Harry has been named the nation's favourite royal in a new poll by YouGov

Good work: Harry's championing of the Invictus Games is thought to have played a part in his soaring popularity

The poll, which was commissioned by Newsweek from YouGov, also looked at how perceptions of the Duchess of Cambridge have changed.

Interest in the Duchess certainly appears to be waning, with just one per cent of respondents saying that they wanted to be like her, with 89 per cent saying they had no interest in being her - even just for a day.

Just 23 per cent of those asked thought she was a 'legitimate voice' of the royal family, while 19 per cent said she should be allowed to voice her opinions more often.

Asked what steps the Duchess could take to boost her popularity, 16 per cent said she should endorse specific charities, while nine per cent said they wanted to see her make more regular public appearances.

Fourth place: Kate came first last year but has now slipped to fourth - with Prince George in sixth place

Enduringly popular: The Queen took second place, while the Duke of Edinburgh was tied with Charles in fifth

Much loved: The Duke of Cambridge is almost as popular as his brother and grandmother and took third place

Despite her limited public appearances, according to YouGov's opinion summary, the Duchess is most often described as a 'positive role model' with attractive, intelligent and genuine also frequently used to describe her.

The word used to describe Prince William most frequently was genuine, with 'good role model' and 'in touch with ordinary people' also applied to the Duke.

But it is Prince Harry who remains the most popular, courtesy of a positivity score of 97 per cent and a controversy score of just four.

Words most often used to describe the UK's favourite royal include 'likeable', 'fun-loving', 'in touch with ordinary people', 'genuine' and 'humorous'. 

Doing well: Prince Charles has also proved a hit with the public and shared fifth place with his father

Fun-loving: Harry, seen here dancing with a girl in Brazil and with Team GB's Dave Henson, is the most liked
