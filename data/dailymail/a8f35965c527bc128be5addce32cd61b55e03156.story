Bath suffered an agonising defeat that could prove terminal to their hopes of qualifying for the Champions Cup knock-out stages as their young tyros were outgunned by a star-studded French outfit.

Following last week's embarrassing loss in Glasgow, Bath were desperate to claim their first win of the European campaign but four-times winners Toulouse had an attacking edge that saw them score three tries to one and left Bath having to settle for a losing bonus-point at The Rec.

Bath fly-half George Ford, eager to press his case for a starting spot in the forthcoming QBE series, struggled to spark his back-line despite a remarkable set-piece performance from his side's injury-hit pack, which included a hugely impressive first start from 19-year-old academy star Charlie Ewels.

'We were that close,' said Bath head coach Mike Ford, who believed his side should have been awarded a penalty in the dying minutes. 'But I'm proud of the guys. They left nothing out on the field. Charlie Ewels is a star of the future.'

But without the injured Kyle Eastmond at No 12, and in the face of a world-class Toulouse defence, Bath were unable to break down their opponents until replacement hooker Ross Batty crossed in the 75th minute.

Without Eastmond running clever angles off his shoulder, Ford turned the ball over three times in contact as he opted to carry when on other occasions he would have off-loaded.

It will not have gone unnoticed by Stuart Lancaster that his second-choice No 10 has not fired on his two outings in Europe this season.

At 21, Ford has time on his side and will surely come good.

Yesterday Ewels, starting his first game at No 8 having won the Under 20s World Cup as a lock, showed enormous potential against Toulouse's world-class back row, which had the hulking Louis Picamoles anchoring the scrum.

The fact Ewels, only playing because of a horrendous run of back-row injuries,  came out with plenty of credit suggests he has an exciting future.

Former England fly-half Toby Flood converted tries by Vincent Clerc and Imanol Harinorduquy, while Luke McAlister converted Maxime Medard's 65th-minute try.

Bath centre Jonathan Joseph said: 'It was hard for some of us wider out to get into the game. We weren't quite there today. The fact it was only two points difference showed great character. It's just gutting to lose.'

Bath's next game is away to Montpellier on December 6 and with a trip to Toulouse also still on the schedule, the prospects of them qualifying from this pool now look slim.
