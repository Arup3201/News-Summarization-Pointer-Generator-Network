Nearly two-thirds of voters oppose 
planned hikes in green taxes – and back David Cameron in his battle with
Nick Clegg  to ‘roll back’ the levies.

A total of 
60 per cent of voters object to the charges, which will hit households 
with an extra £270 per year on their energy bills by 2020. Just 18 per 
cent support the taxes.

The findings, in a Survation poll, come after
a week in which double-digit hikes by the energy companies dominated 
debate at Westminster.

Roll back row: David Cameron is locked in a battle with his Deputy Nick Clegg over planned hikes in green taxes

The row over heating bills was galvanised last month when Ed Miliband pledged to freeze bills for two years after the next Election if he becomes Prime Minister.

But our survey reveals 
Mr Cameron’s promise last week to cut the levies is backed by more 
people (40 per cent) than Mr Miliband’s freeze (33 per cent). And only 
seven per cent back Mr Clegg.

The public seem sceptical about whether
Mr Miliband’s freeze is workable: a majority, 54 per cent, think the 
energy companies will just hike their prices before or after the freeze 
to compensate for lost revenues.

Big promise: Ed Miliband pledged to freeze bills for two years should he win the next election

The Mail on Sunday poll shows 61 per
cent support for Mr Cameron’s move, against just 11 per cent who want 
to keep the taxes in place.

The energy firms say the compulsory levies 
–  such as the £33 which the typical family pays each year in subsidies 
for wind farms and solar parks – have contributed to their price rises.

Last week ex-Prime Minister Sir John Major warned surging bills meant 
that millions of people would face a choice between ‘heating and eating’
this winter.

A total of 38 per cent of those asked by Survation said
they have already had to cut back on essential purchases such as food 
to afford their heating bills.

This rises to 56 per cent of those in the
poorest social groups. If extrapolated to the nation at large, it would
mean 19 million people have had to choose between ‘heating and eating’.

It is clear from the poll who voters blame for the hikes: 59 per 
cent cite the firms while just 15 per cent blame the Government.

The 
same proportion blames the last Labour Government.

The poll has Labour on 35 per cent, the Tories 29, the Lib Dems on 12 and UKIP 17.

Survation interviewed 1,000 people on Friday.

Electricity costs are still certain to rise massively over the next seven years to pay for the shift to renewable energy – even if David Cameron succeeds in his plan to trim green levies, writes David Rose.

The reason is the new Energy Bill which commits Britain to colossal increases in subsidies for renewables such as wind and solar power. A Department of Energy and Climate Change document says the subsidies  will rise steadily from about £2.35 billion now to £7.6 billion  in 2020-21.

Energy expert Peter Atherton, of Liberum Capital, says green levies are likely to cost households an average of £400 a year just for electricity – minus mall reductions Mr Cameron hopes to make by trimming the budget for items such as insulation.

These eye-watering sums are the consequence of Britain’s earlier pledge to cut overall carbon dioxide emissions by 15 per cent by 2020, enshrined in the 2008 Climate Change Act – piloted by then Energy Secretary Ed Miliband.

It is much harder to cut emissions from transport and heating, so almost the entire cut must be absorbed by the power industry. To meet the Act’s legally binding target, it must triple the proportion of electricity made by renewables to 33 per cent, requiring an investment of about £100 billion. A further subsidy is to be paid to fossil fuel power station operators whose plants would otherwise become uneconomic. It is expected this will cost another £15 per home.

But experts say if subsidies look expensive in 2020, they will cost far more ten years later. Under the official ‘Fourth Carbon Budget’, set by the Government’s Committee on Climate Change, the UK power sector is supposed to have cut its emissions from electricity generation by about 90 per cent in 2030. Mr Atherton says this is likely to require more than  £300 billion investment in nuclear plants and renewables.
