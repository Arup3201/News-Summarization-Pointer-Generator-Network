Arrest: Ketut Pujayasa has been charged with attempted murder and sexual abuse

A court in Florida has heard how a 31-year-old American woman was found 'painted in blood from head to toe' after being beaten and raped by a cabin steward on a Holland America cruise ship.

Prosecutors allege witnesses saw the passenger who was only identified in court by initials, covered in blood, after a savage and brutal beating by Ketut 
Pujayasa, a room service attendant on the Nieuw Amsterdam.

Pujayasa claims he 
attacked the 31-year-old because she insulted his family when he tried 
to deliver her breakfast on Valentine's Day.

The vicious assault on the woman only came to a halt when passengers, who heard the commotion inside the stateroom, began banging on the door.

The Indonesian cabin attendant has been denied bail after prosecutors told a federal judge that he admitted to raping and beating the lady during a nude cruise, before trying to throw her 
overboard.

The 28-year-old cruise ship worker told the FBI he used a master key to break into the passenger's room at night time, and attacked her in her bed.

The ships' doctor, a 40-year veteran emergency room physician, told FBI agents that the woman was so severely injured he thought she might die.

'In his 40 years, he had not seen such a violent attack,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Francis Viamontes said. 'Every witness who saw her said she was completely covered in blood.'

The woman, who was on a Bare Necessities nudist cruise, was saved after a fellow passenger pounded on her guestroom door, allegedly scaring off Pujayasa who claims to have jumped to a lower balcony to escape. 

FBI agent David Nunez testified that Pujayasa, a room service attendant on the ship, confessed to his roommate and gave to a statement to authorities.

Pujayasa allegedly told police he decided to attack the woman, who has not been named, after she told him: 'Wait a minute, son of a b****' when he knocked on her door with her breakfast.

'Pujayasa stated that the passenger's 
comment of "son of a bitch" was offensive to himself and his parents. He
 was angry and upset the rest of the day.

He interpreted the comment as an insult to his family and sought revenge.

Pujayasa told the agents that he was accustomed to personal insults and verbal abuse from rude passengers but lost it over what he said was an insult to his family.

'He made that point over and over again, that it wasn't about insulting him, it was about insulting his family â€” especially his mother,' Agent Nunez said.

 Prosecutors said they have a wealth of other evidence â€” including his confession and pending DNA test results they expect will confirm he was the attacker.

Pujayasa, who is married and lived with his wife, parents and three siblings in Indonesia, had no prior criminal history in the U.S. or his native country, officials said.

The steward had considered hitting 
the woman when he spotted her on a deck later in the day, but decided it
 was too crowded, he told police.

He
 allegedly used a master key to get in the passenger's room, and waited 
on the balcony for the woman to return to her room that night, then hit 
her with a laptop and tried to choke her with the cord from curling 
tongs and a phone wire.

His
 victim fought back, biting him, striking at his exposed genitals and 
using a corkscrew to try to stab him, Pujayasa reportedly told the FBI.

He claimed that he wanted to throw the woman into the sea, while the ship was passing by Roatan, Honduras.

The room, the balcony and the doors that lead to it were all smeared with blood, agents said.

FBI agents said the woman, who is about 5 feet 6 inches tall and has a "medium fit build," fought hard to defend herself, stabbing at her attacker with a corkscrew she managed to grab.

She told them she bit the man's right hand when he put it in her mouth to try to stifle her screams for help, and agents said she left a visible bite mark on Pujayasa.

As the woman fought back, passengers began pounding on her door trying to help her.

The noise coming from outside the stateroom distracted the alleged assailant and the woman was able to flee her stateroom.

After
 her attacker was scared off, the victim fled to a hallway where a 
fellow passenger found her covered in blood and wearing only a tank 
top.

'The passenger also noted that [the 
victim] had a curling iron wrapped and tangled around her neck and/or 
hair. He also described [her] as having black eyes and visible bruising 
around her neck and shoulders.

'[The woman], fearing death was imminent, 
asked the passenger to relay to her family how much she loved them,' the FBI report stated.

The cruise ship docked in Honduras and the victim was airlifted to a Florida hospital. Security guards on the ship detained Pujayasa until they arrived in the Everglades on Sunday.

The victim had been on an eight-day 
cruise with nudist vacation specialists Bare Necessities, which took in 
Jamaica, the Bahamas and Honduras on a voyage that left Florida on 
February 9.

As well as traveling to exotic 
destinations, guests were able to take part in couples massage, Tantra 
classes, a production of the Vagina Monologues and a Captain's party, according to the travel company's website.

Guests on the cruises, which had been run previously on the Nieuw Amsterdam, are required to wear clothes only when the ship is in port, or when they are at dinner or attending the Captain's party.

In a statement to Mail Online, Nancy Tiemann, the co-owner of Bare Necessities, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the incident that occurred on one of our cruise ship charters last week and are encouraged by reports that our passenger is recovering from her injuries.'

'Our hearts go out to our passenger and we stand ready to aid her in any way possible. It would be a disservice to our cruise guest to comment on what is a most difficult and disturbing incident,' she added.

Pujayasa has been charged with attempted murder and aggravated sexual abuse. Holland America has fired the employee, who had worked for the company since 2012.

Agents said Pujayasa, who is 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds, inflicted a horrific beating and sexual assault on the woman, a U.S. citizen identified only by her initials in court.

He said he fell asleep on her balcony while waiting for her to return, remained hidden until she lay down and closed her eyes, then violently attacked her, agents said.

The cruise company told the Daily News he had been subject to a careful screening, had no criminal record and had no performance issues before the alleged attack.

'We continue to work closely with 
authorities to understand how this incident occurred and what additional
 actions we can take to help ensure that nothing like this ever happens 
again,' a statement from the company said.

If convicted, he faces up to life in federal prison and would be deported if he ever gets out of prison.
