Driving force: Britain's sports goods retailer is controlled by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley (pictured). The lucrative plan was created in 2009

Thousands of shop workers at Sports Direct are in line for a bonus worth £76,500 after the High Street retailer posted bumper profits.

The firm, which owns 396 shops including Lillywhites in London’s Piccadilly, has benefited from unprecedented success in British sport and has attracted more shoppers by slashing prices and revamping stores.

It is set to distribute millions of shares among 2,000 staff – many of whom earn a basic salary of around £20,000.

The firm says its generous incentive scheme is what has driven annual profit up 40 per cent to £207.2million.

‘The share scheme has been the glue to the performance,’ said chief executive Dave Forsey. ‘It has combined with better products, low prices and good value to deliver record results.

‘If you have so many people linked to performance, from thousands in the back office to the shop floor, all driven by such an incentive, it is very powerful.

'Everyone is thinking about how they can challenge the business and they really do care about every aspect. It is a very compelling culture – good for consumers and great for employees.’

Mr Forsey said he has been contacted by a number of non-competing retailers wanting to emulate the incentive scheme.

Britain’s biggest sports goods retailer, which is controlled by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, created the lucrative bonus plan in 2009.

It is set to pay out to eligible staff – more than 2,000 of its 23,000-strong workforce – next month. An employee on £20,000 a year in 2009 will pick up 12,000 shares – worth around £76,500.

Sports Direct is also part way through a four-year share incentive bonus scheme created in 2011 for about 3,000 staff.

Mr Ashley owns 64 per cent of the firm and works under the title executive deputy chairman.

He is seen as the driving force behind the success of Sports Direct but has not taken a salary since floating the business on the London Stock Exchange in 2007.

Plans to award him a bonus of £60million linked to performance were ditched after other investors felt the targets were not demanding enough.

The proposal is being redrawn. Mr Forsey said: ‘We are very keen to look at how we can reward Mike because he’s absolutely making a massive difference to our business.’

Sports Direct’s profit hike comes after underlying sales increased 11.2pc over the past financial year as it strengthened its grip on the market following the collapse of rival JJB.

The firm also owns Sports World as well as the Slazenger, Lonsdale, and Dunlop brands.
