It is an internet forum where parents can share advice on subjects such as potty training and the spiralling cost of childcare.

But Mumsnet has also attracted thousands of posts on risqué topics, as women members clamour to share details of their explicit bedroom antics.

The website – popular with middle-class mothers – risks undermining its wholesome image because many users seem preoccupied with X-rated chatter.

A team of moderators delete the most obscene messages, but unless users report a comment, it remains on the site.

Yesterday, new threads included ‘Ever s****** anyone famous?’ and ‘I had a dream last night. I’m blushing about it’, which involved a threesome with two men.

The day before, users mused over questions such as ‘What is the sexiest thing you have ever had whispered in your ear?’

The website features conversations among women about everything from fivesomes and sex toys to rape fantasies and a bikini wax that became too hands-on.

The racy banter risks driving away 
mothers who visit the site to discuss topics such as health, politics 
and parenting. Several have already expressed their boredom at the 
incessant chatter about people’s sex lives.

Forum boards: 'Do you dunk your penis' got an array of responses and sparked a flurry of debate on Twitter

When one user, known as Cindy Crawford’s Left Leg, wrote of her husband’s unorthodox suggestion to spice up their sex life, a wearied mother wrote: ‘Yawn, yawn. But cindy … there’s one of these threads at least once a week … they are tres boring … and who really gives a **** about your sex life?’.

Members are also often scolded by fellow users for providing ‘tmi’ – too much information – in the discussions about sex.

In one post, a woman revealed that her husband ‘took Viagra for the first time last night’, describing what happened next in such graphic detail that one user responded, ‘eyes watering’.

A thread about ‘weird sexual  fantasies now you are pregnant’ also prompted admissions of bondage and fantasies about boy band One Direction.

Men have also turned to the site to seek advice on everything from a wife’s porn addiction to her unwillingness to try new things in the bedroom.

Even discussions about education took a steamy turn, with  one user suggesting she  would have to seduce Education Secretary Michael Gove wearing a mortar board and on a desk covered with copies of the national curriculum in order to secure his prompt resignation.

She said she would then sell her story, and ‘he resigns, job done’. ‘I mean, I would be doing it for the kids,’ she added.

The website was set up in 2000 by friends Carrie Longton and Justine Roberts and now boasts 50million page views a month and an annual turnover of £4 million.

Mrs Roberts, chief executive, said: ‘Happily, it seems some  mothers do still have time  and energy for their sex lives  and we’ve always been pleased to provide a go-to destination for straight answers.

‘People’s sex lives come up occasionally but those threads are rarely reported.

‘It seems that mothers on the whole think that sex is a normal part of life.’
