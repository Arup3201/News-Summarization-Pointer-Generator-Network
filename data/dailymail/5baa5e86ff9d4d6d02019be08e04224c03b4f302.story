The Federal Aviation Administration has launched a security review at Air Traffic Control facilities after a deliberate blaze in Chicago caused serious flight disruption which is set to last for two weeks.

The incident on Friday was caused when an employee set fire to a room containing communications equipment at an Air Traffic Control center in Chicago. 

By Monday, O'Hare International was only back to 60 per cent capacity while Midway International Airport was running at 75 per cent.

Still waiting: The FAA revealed Sunday that it's set an October 13 goal for restoring all the flights that were delayed or canceled after an O'Hare control room was sabotage by a suicidal employee on Friday

Michael Huerta of the FAA said a review into what happened has been launched and he wants a report on his desk within 30 days. 

He said: 'If we need to make changes because of the incident that happened in Chicago on Friday I will not hesitate to do so.'

He added that new rule and background checks on people working in ATC centers may need to be introduced.  

Experts believe that the passengers will continue to face delays at O'Hare until October 13 at the earliest.    

That's the 'target' date the FAA has set for fully restoring service at the Chicago airport and allaying the inevitable nationwide ripple effect of having a major travel hub so crippled.

Some 2,100 flights were canceled at major airports across the country on Friday after FAA telecom contractor set a fire in a basement before slashing his own throat and arms in a suicide attempt.

Chaos: Some 4,000 flights were grounded by the sabotage as of Sunday and more issues were expected to stretch into the weeks ahead

On Saturday, the resulting air control chaos caused another 1,100 flight cancellations nationwide. Sunday saw 700 grounded flights.

Howard, 36, of Naperville, who had access to the control center in suburban Aurora via a swipe card, entered around 5 a.m. Friday, and about 30 minutes later posted a suicide note on Facebook, according to a federal criminal complaint.

Minutes later, someone at the facility called 911 to report the fire. A relative who saw the Facebook post also alerted authorities. Paramedics followed a trail of blood past a gas can, two knives and a lighter and found the suspect slashing his throat, the complaint said. He also had cuts to his arms.

Howard was charged with a federal felony count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, prosecutors said.

'Our team is on site working 24/7 with the (FAA) to install new equipment and restore service to full capacity as quickly as possible,' Harris spokesman Jim Burke said in a statement. 

Howard worked for eight years as a Harris field technician, and was terminated after the incident.

O'Hare, one of the world's busiest airports, is the largest hub of United Airlines and a major hub for American Airlines. The airport averaged about 2,700 flights a day in August with a daily average of about 220,000 passengers in the month, according to its website.

The FAA said that air traffic controllers who normally work at the Aurora facility are now working at other surrounding FAA facilities to help maximize traffic flow in and out of Chicago-area airports while repairs are being made.

The FAA said on Saturday that it had decided to completely replace the central communications network in a different part of the same building to restore the system as quickly as possible.

The first shipment of replacement equipment is scheduled to arrive late on Sunday night, and teams will be working around the clock to install it, the FAA said.
