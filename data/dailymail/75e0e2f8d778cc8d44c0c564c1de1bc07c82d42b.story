Learning: Parents are being urged to restrict use of tablets because children are struggling with basic motor skills, teachers claim

Children are not developing the dexterity needed to write and build models because they spend too long on computer tablets, teachers warned yesterday.

They also struggle to learn lines for school plays and answer pen and paper exams because they are used to calling up information instantly on their computers or smartphones.

Parents are being urged to restrict use of tablets and turn off the wi-fi in their homes at night to stop their children going on the internet.

Members of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers warned that growing numbers of young children are able to swipe tablet screens but lack the motor skills needed to play with building blocks.

They also struggle to socialise with others or concentrate unless their focus is on computer-generated images.

Delegates at ATL’s annual conference in Manchester backed calls for medical experts to help produce guidance for parents as well as teachers on avoiding excessive use of tablets.

They passed a resolution warning that computer tablet ‘addiction’ was leading to poor performance at school, irritability, furtiveness and loss of interest in other activities.

Colin Kinney, representing ATL’s Northern Ireland branch, said some parents were substituting the development of social skills with tablets.

‘I have spoken to a number of nursery teachers who have concerns over the increasing numbers of young pupils who can swipe a screen but have little or no manipulative skills to play with building blocks or the like, or the pupils who cannot socialise with other pupils but whose parents talk proudly of their ability to use a tablet or smartphone,’ he said.

‘Many of us have seen the brilliant computer skills of some pupils outweighed by their deteriorating skills in pen and paper exams because they rely on the instant support of the computer.

‘They are often unable to apply what they should have learned from their textbooks or class notes.’

Pupils were turning up to school exhausted because they had night much of the previous night playing computer games, he added.

Their attention spans were ‘so limited they may as well not be there’.

‘We do not want to deprive our pupils of access to computer tablets but we do want to protect them from withdrawal, poor performance and loss of educational opportunities,’ he said.

Mark Montgomery, a fellow Northern Ireland delegate, said children increasingly wanted to spend hours playing on tablets instead of ‘playing football outside, building models and learning through playing’.

‘During rehearsals for our school play, the producer complained that the children in lead roles had great difficulty in learning all of their lines,’ he added.

Sedentary: excessive tablet and smartphone use can also cause weight gain thanks to a 'lack of movement and exercise'

‘This had not been an issue in previous years and would suggest that because information is always instantly available there is less need to learn and to retain knowledge.’

He warned that over-use of tablets was also having detrimental effects on pupils’ health, such as weight gain caused by ‘lack of movement and exercise’ as well as repetitive strain injuries and posture problems.

He added: ‘I have three sons. When they were younger I would go to bed and turn off the wi-fi. Parents need to do that. Turn the wi-fi off.

‘There is the ability to restrict the amount of time they are online for, there are apps to download.

‘Children get obsessed with things and find it difficult to say no. If you take a two-year-old’s teddy away or a teenager’s X-Box they will rant and rave. But an adult will go and do something different.’

Mr Montgomery went on: ‘It is our job to make sure that the technology is being used wisely and productively and that pupils are not making backward steps and getting obsessed and exhibiting aggressive and anti-social behaviours.’

The warning follows research from Ofcom last year which found children’s access to tablets at home has more than doubled from 20 per cent in 2012 to 51 per cent.

It has also been claimed that the boom in tablet ownership has led to children as young as four are being treated for ‘iPad addiction’.

One girl of four reportedly became so obsessed with playing games on a tablet she was enrolled in therapy by her parents who wanted her treated for compulsive behaviour.

The pre-school child, from the south east of England, became hooked on a tablet at the age of three and was using it for up to four hours a day, becoming ‘inconsolable’ when it was taken away.
