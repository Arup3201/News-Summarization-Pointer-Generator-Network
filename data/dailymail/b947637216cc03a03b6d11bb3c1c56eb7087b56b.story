Guilty: Joyce, 23, fought Doherty and bit off part of his ear

A cousin of Celebrity Big Brother winner Paddy Doherty who bit off the ear of the reality star in a bare-knuckle street brawl has been jailed.

Johnny Joyce, 21, sank his teeth into the Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star's ear during a fierce gypsy brawl outside a PC World in Manchester.

The fight between Joyce and 52-year-old Doherty was filmed on a mobile phone and loaded to YouTube, showing the blood-splattered reality TV star grappling with his cousin in front of rush hour traffic.

The 'revolting' brawl in June last 
year had been sparked by a long-running family feud which saw Doherty 
claim he had 'shunned' by the gypsy community over his celebrity status.

During
the fight, Joyce's brother Dougie, 23, was overheard baying for blood 
shouting: 'Come you dirty Doherty bast**d, give it to him Johnny, give 
to the dirty tramp, floor the dirty tramp.'

Celebrity Big brother winner Doherty later underwent surgery to have ear sewn back on.

He himself admitted affray but was given a suspended jail term earlier this month.

Today Joyce, of Middleton also admitted affray but was jailed after Manchester Crown Court was told he had a history of violence.

In sentencing Joyce to 15 months jail, Judge Martin Steiger condemned the 'revolting nature of this family feud'.

The judge added: 'Whatever the right and wrong of this feud I have to pass sentence regardless of how this incident started.

'I am prepared to accept that Paddy Doherty may have made the first move but what happened thereafter was that the wrong doing was on the side of Johnny Joyce.

'Traffic was held up and members of the public were frightened and Doherty received the worst injuries, he was bleeding from his face and his ear was badly bitten.

It's preposterous to say that this action resulted from self defence.

'Johnny Joyce has the worst record for 
violence and furthermore the probation officer recommends a custodial 
sentence with Johnny Joyce having made it quite clear he wasn't prepared
to consider unpaid work.'

Doherty himself escaped jail when he was handed a 51-week suspended sentence for the brawl earlier this month

The fight was the latest round of a bloody feud between Doherty and the Joyce brothers which was sparked by a row at a family funeral.

In August 2010 a shooting took place at the home of Johnny's mother after he handed himself in over an earlier bust up with Doherty at his caravan site.

Then in February 2011 Johnny was tried and acquitted of causing grievous boldly harm after claiming he acted in self defence.

Four months later Johnny and 23-year old Dougie ran into Doherty on busy Great Ancoats street in Manchester while the TV star was out jogging and the Joyce brothers were shopping for a birthday present.

Prosecuting, Mr Richard Vardon, said: 'There is and was at the relevant time bad blood between Doherty on the one hand and Johnny and Dougie on the other.

'The footage shows a fight and on the recording Dougie Joyce can be heard encouraging Johnny to hit Doherty and not to stop.'

Johnny had previous convictions for assault in 2005, robbery and dangerous driving in 2006, an assault in the street in 2007 and a GBH beating in a nightclub in 2008.

In mitigation his counsel Michael Lavery, said the three men were arguing when Doherty said 'come on fight with me' and removed his inch think gold ring.

Mr Lavery added: 'He invited a fight and a fight is what he got. The fact that Doherty received more serious injuries shouldn't be taken into account, that shows who were the stronger and more fortunate.

'When one engages in a fight willingly or enters into it one is likely to be injured.

The fact that he received more injuries than Johnny Joyce is not something that should be held against Johnny Joyce, when both men were prepared to fight each other.

Violence: Doherty and his cousin were involved in a fight outside a PC world, similar to this one, in Manchester

'Mr Doherty is a man who has previously made something of a career from himself as being a man who is prepared to use violence.

'He had used that in the media to his advantage in the TV show Britain's Most Dangerous Men.

'He said: ‘when I fight I would bite them, bite their ears, bite their noses and swallow it to permanently disfigure them, I wouldn't spit it out so it couldn't be sewn back on'.

'It's as a result of that programme that his career as a celebrity started and he became a person with a certain notoriety in the gypsy community.

'There has to be a point where these two parties stop acting in this way and I'm told by Johnny Joyce that this happens today.'

Boxer Dougie admitted using threatening behaviour and was given a 12 month community order. He was also ordered to complete 150 hours unpaid work and pay £500 costs.
