President Obama woke up the day after Christmas for a session in the gym and a trip to the beach with his family.

He exercised at the Marine Corps Base Hawaii before joining wife Michelle, and daughters Malia and Sasha under the sunny skies at the Bellows Air Force Station in Waimanalo.

Later in the day, after a week of golfing, the president hit the links again with friends Greg Orme, Bobby Titcomb and Mike Ramos, the White House said. This time, they played at the Royal Hawaiian Golf Club in Kailua, a lush course with views of the Koolau Mountains. The club is currently under renovation and only has nine holes open, according to its website.

On the way back to the Kailua vacation home on Friday, a child sat on a shirtless man's shoulders watching the passing motorcade and children jumped on a trampoline. 

After waking up on Christmas morning the family gathered in their home to open Christmas gifts and sing carols, the White House said.

After a few cloudy and rainy days, a sun-soaked Christmas meant that they could return to the beach.

In the late afternoon, he spoke to a few hundred troops in a mess hall at Marine Corps Base Hawaii, where troops and their families had just wrapped up a Christmas dinner including turkey, ham, lobster, candied yams and green beans. 

After brief remarks, Obama was taking photos in private with the troops and their families.

During his Christmas Address, which aired on Thursday he paid tribute to servicemen as the 10-year mission in Afghanistan drew to a close.

'Because of the extraordinary service of the men and women in the American armed forces, Afghanistan has a chance to rebuild its own country,' Obama said to applause from Marines and their families. 'We are safer. It's not going to be a source of terrorist attacks again.' 

In wishing all Americans a Merry Christmas as part of their annual address, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle turned the focus to the sacrifice of U.S. troops and their families, and how the combat mission in Afghanistan would soon be over.

'We're able to gather with family and friends because our troops are willing to hug theirs goodbye and step forward to serve,' Obama said in the speech.

'After a long day, we can come home because they're willing to leave their families and deploy.

'We can celebrate the holidays because they're willing to miss their own,' Obama said.

'And so, as our troops continue to transition back home - back to our businesses, our schools, our congregations, and our communities - it's up to all of us to serve them as well as they have served us.'

Thirteen years and $1 trillion later, the U.S. is preparing to pull the vast majority of its combat troops out of Afghanistan by year's end, as the U.S. and its partners seek to turn the page on a bloody chapter that started the day that al-Qaida militants struck American soil on Sept. 11, 2011. 

From a peak 140,000 troops in 2010, the U.S. and NATO plan to leave just 13,500 behind for training and battlefield support.

Although there are reasons for cautious optimism, including a new Afghan president whose seriousness of effort has inspired U.S. confidence, the broader picture still looks glim.

The U.S. is shifting to a supporting role after the bloodiest year in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. Civilian casualties this year are on track to hit 10,000, and some 5,000 Afghan forces were also killed in 2014, a figure that has escalated as the country took on a greater role in its own security. Insurgents have seized territory across the country, raising fears that Islamic militants will successfully exploit the security vacuum formed as the U.S. pulls out.

Roughly 2,200 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan over the last 13 years in a war that cost the U.S. $1 trillion, plus another $100 billion for reconstruction. A celebratory cheer of 'hooah' rang out from the hundreds of troops here when Obama affirmed that the combat mission was finally ending.

'We still have some very difficult missions around the world — including in Iraq,' Obama said. But, he added, 'the world is better, it's safer, it's more peaceful, it's more prosperous and our homeland protected because of you.'

On the U.S. mainland and across the globe, other prominent leaders were fanning out, echoing the president's message with their own Christmas visits and phone calls to American troops.

Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, to spend time with wounded troops and their families and express gratitude for their service. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called military members on deployment, the Pentagon said, including those in Afghanistan and others assigned to U.S. Central Command, which is running the U.S. mission to fight the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.

Senator. John McCain, was spending Christmas in Kabul, Afghanistan, where the former Navy pilot met Thursday with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his chief executive officer, Abdullah Abdullah. A chief critic of Obama's foreign policy, McCain is set to lead the Senate Armed Services Committee next year.
