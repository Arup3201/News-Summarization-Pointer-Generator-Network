Tens of thousands of dead fish floated into a southern California harbor this weekend because the water was depleted of oxygen, experts believe.

Anchovies, sting rays and other dead marine life numbering as many as 70,000 blanketed the surface of Marina Del Rey Saturday afternoon.

The layer of fish sent birds into a feeding frenzy and bait fisherman scrambling to snag as much free bait as they could before work crews cleaned up the mess – it also created a foul odor that permeated the air.

Oxygen starved: The Los Angeles County Sheriff's office said the dead anchovies, stingrays and even an octopus rose to the surface at a section of the harbor Saturday evening

‘It was like a Hitchcock movie,’ Michael Quill told KABC. ‘There were so many birds diving into the water and feeding. You could see the silver of the fish underwater, it was crazy.’

Several people speculated that warmer weather may have caused an algae bloom leading to a lack of oxygen that doomed the fish.

Benjamin Kay, a marine biologist, told the station called the inlet an ‘oxygen dead zone,’ and said that heated water ‘can't hold oxygen as normal as if it were cooler, then we get these massive fish kills.‘This is a classic harbor event.’

Marine activist Matthew King, of Heal the Bay, told KNBC that ‘hot weather always has been associated with low oxygen levels in the water.’

The disturbing deaths occur almost once a year, the marine biologist argued, but at least one long-time resident in the community about four miles from Los Angeles International Airport disagreed.

‘I’ve been here for about 20 years and this is the first time I’ve seen a fish kill like this one,’ Tom Difloure told KTLA.

Workers had cleaned up most of the dead fish, and their unbearable stench by late Sunday, KNBC reported. About 175 garbage bags weighing a combined 7,000 pounds were taken away.

But the horrific smell lingered and questions remained.

Local officials were not able to be immediately reached by MailOnline, and they have not given an official cause of the kill-off.
