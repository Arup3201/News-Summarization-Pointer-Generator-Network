When James Garcia recently learned that his dog Elmo had just a few months left to live, he decided not to waste one minute left his his best friend.Â 

The New York man got the news earlier this month that the 16-year-old dog he co-parents with his ex was dying of liver cancer, bladder disease and renal failure.

Since then, he's been toting Elmo across New York City, showing the little dog his favorite sites and restaurants in a grand farewell to his longtime companion.

Goodbye: To bid farewell to the 16-year-old dog, Mr Garcia has started taking him to all of his favorite sites in New York City including Times Square

'The vet has given him a couple of months,' Mr Garcia told Buzzfeed. 'So I decided not to sit and cry but to make the moments together matter and decided to take him to every one of my favorite NYC spots.'

Since Elmo's legs no longer work, Mr Garcia went out and bought a stroller to take the dog to eat at Shake Shack, through the Museum of Modern Art and across the Brooklyn Bridge.

Elmo even got to meet his namesake Sesame Street character in Times Square and witness Manhattanhenge - a spectacular sunset through the city's buildings.

Though Elmo will soon pass, he now has a mark on this city thanks to Mr Garcia who had grafitti artist Greg Siff paint a picture of his pooch.

Mr Garcia says he hopes to write a book someday on how to say goodbye to a dying pet by 'sharing experiences together'.

He told People magazine that his New York outings with Elmo have helped him 'cope with his fate' and 'create memories that will last a lifetime'.
