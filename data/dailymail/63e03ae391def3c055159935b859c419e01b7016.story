After losing his wife and unborn baby daughter, and then spending
weeks locked in a legal battle to have the brain-dead woman taken off
life support, Erick Munoz may now be forced to pay thousands of dollars in
medical bills.

Marlise Munoz was declared legally dead after her paramedic husband found her unconscious at their Texas family home November 26, possibly due to a blood clot. But because she was 14 weeks pregnant, doctors refused to take her off life support under a pro-life state law.

After winning a lengthy court battle, Mrs Munoz's life support was switched off Sunday and both she and the 23-week-old fetus, which was said to have abnormalities because of oxygen deprivation, died at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.

Speaking with CNN's Anderson Cooper Wednesday, Mr Munoz revealed that he has been receiving hospital bills at his home, although he is not sure at this time what he will be expected to pay for his wife's forced medical care.

Erick Munoz said that he had promised his wife to respect her wishes and take her off life support; her mother, Lynne Machado, recalled that towards the end, she could see her daughter's body decaying

'They have not come to me and said how that’s going to work,' Mr Munoz said on Anderson Cooper 360. 'But I believe I’ve heard several media outlets…saying that they’ve 
asked about that. They have asked that question. They [the hospital] said they would 
continue normal billing.'

According to the site ThinkProgress, John Peter Smith Hospital has declined to disclose how much, if anything, the Munoz family would have to pay, saying that patients' billing information is covered by privacy laws.

A recent report from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project stated that the average cost per hospital stay was $9,700 in 2010. 

However, that number varies greatly depending on the type of insurance coverage, or lack thereof.

During the interview, Erick Munoz was joined by his mother-in-law, Lynne Machado, who said that she knew her daughter's battle was over the moment hospital staff brought her to the ER after she coded.

Marlise Munoz's mother added that she and the rest of the family had known for years that the woman never wanted to be artificially kept alive.

‘I promised her, I told her, I will honor your wishes,’ Erick Munoz recalled telling his legally dead spouse.

Mr Munoz added that even his wife's doctors did not know at first about the existence of the arcane state law that prohibits hospitals from turning off a patient's life support if she is pregnant.

Lynne Machado described in agonizing detail in the interview how towards the end, her daughter's body had begun to visibly deteriorate, making it difficult to look at an empty shell of what had been her beloved daughter.

'When I go by her head, I smell death,' she recounted.

Both Munoz and Machado said they are now speaking out publicly about their ordeal because they want to encourage families to have a conversation about end-of-life decisions.

Mr Munoz had previously revealed that he named what would have been the couple's second child  Nicole after his wife's middle name.

Mother: Marlise Munoz was already a mother of one. She was a few months pregnant when she suffered a blood clot and went brain dead

He said doctors at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth indicated to him that the fetus would likely have been a girl, although his attorneys previously claimed the fetus suffered from a lower body deformation that made it impossible to determine its sex.

'They think it was a female,' Mr Munoz said in a brief telephone interview with The Associated Press.

Mr Munoz also told WFAA-TV in an interview which aired on Monday evening that he has seen many negative comments about his decision, but he feels he made the right choice.

'I'm just glad they are not in my shoes. I hope every day that no one ever has to go through what I went through,' he said.

Mr Munoz said his wife will be cremated and there are no plans for memorial or funeral services because the family is concerned that protesters would show up.

'She made me a better man, and I thank her for it. I thank her very much,' he said.

Both the hospital and his attorneys agreed the fetus could not have been born alive that early in the pregnancy, and the fetus was not delivered when John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth complied on Sunday with a judge's order to pull any life-sustaining treatment from Marlise Munoz.

Doctors said Mrs Munoz, then 16-weeks pregnant, was brain-dead in November after Erick Munoz found her unconscious in their Haltom City home, possibly due to a blood clot.

But the hospital had kept on machines to keep her organs functioning for the sake of the fetus, which it said was per Texas law.

The case inspired debates about abortion and end-of-life decisions, as well as whether a pregnant woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on life support for the sake of a fetus.

Mr Munoz's attorneys, Heather King and Jessica Hall Janicek, had issued a statement last week saying that according to medical records, 'the fetus is distinctly abnormal'.

The attorneys said the fetus also had fluid building up inside the skull and possibly had a heart problem.

Mr Munoz told AP earlier that he believed in God but felt his training as a paramedic suggested the fetus would have been seriously harmed by his wife's condition.

Filing suit: Erick Munoz filed suit against John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas to force the hospital to remove the life support keeping his pregnant brain dead wife alive

He sued the hospital because it would not remove life support. He said his wife, also a paramedic, had told him she would not want to be kept alive under such circumstances.

In refusing his request, the hospital cited Texas law that says life-sustaining treatment cannot be withdrawn from a pregnant patient, regardless of her end-of-life wishes.

Legal experts told AP that the hospital was misreading the Texas Advance Directives Act and that the law isn't an absolute command to keep a pregnant woman on life support.

Judge R.H Wallace Jr sided with Erick Munoz on Friday, saying in his order: 'Mrs Munoz is dead.'

The case has been noted by Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry and the two leading candidates running to replace him, but none has called for any new laws or action yet.

In recent years, the Legislature has enacted several new anti-abortion restrictions, including setting the legal guideline for when a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks.

During a debate among the four big-name Republicans running for lieutenant governor on Monday night, all of them said the judge erred in ordering that Marlise Munoz be removed from life support and vowed if elected to tighten state law so that a similar outcome couldn't happen again.
