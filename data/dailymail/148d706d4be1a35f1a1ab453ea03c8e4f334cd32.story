Troops have been deployed at American posts across the world ahead of the release of a report into CIA torture tactics which experts warn could spark a wave of violence and terrorism.

The 480-page Senate report summarizes a still-classified 6,000 page study about measures used on al Qaeda detainees held in secret across Europe and Asia following the 9/11 attacks. 

Disturbing passages include descriptions of such techniques as sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces, humiliation and the simulated drowning process known as waterboarding.

The report also says the torture failed to produce life-saving intelligence - a conclusion disputed by  CIA director John Brennan.

Fears: A report concluding the CIA's tortures were not effective could sparked global violence, it is claimed

Warned: The Obama administration supports the release of a report on CIA torture tactics despite warnings that it could incite violence and murder. The 480-page summary describes disturbing post-9/11 techniques

Its release next week comes despite warnings from intelligence officials and foreign governments of 'the heightened potential that it could stimulate a violent response'.

On Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry urged the senator in charge of the report to consider the timing of the release. 

U.S. intelligence agencies and foreign governments have said privately that the release of the report is likely to cost lives, according to Rep Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who is regularly briefed on intelligence assessments.

However, Obama administration officials say they still support making it public. 

Rogers questioned why the report needed to become public, given that the Justice Department investigated and filed no criminal charges.

A congressional aide noted that the White House has led negotiations to declassify the report since April, and that both the president and his director of national intelligence have endorsed its release. 

The government has taken steps to beef up security at American posts around the world, said the aide, who was not authorized to be quoted by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. 

President Barack Obama has acknowledged: 'We tortured some folks.'   

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the Los Angeles Times in a story published Sunday that 'We have to get this report out.' 

Feinstein told the Los Angeles Times that the harsh interrogations undermined 'societal and constitutional values that we are very proud of. Anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again.'
