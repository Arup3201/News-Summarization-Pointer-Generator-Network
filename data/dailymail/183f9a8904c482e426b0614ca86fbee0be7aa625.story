An 809-pound tiger shark caught in the Gulf of Mexico earlier this month has been cooked and served to more than 90 poor and homeless Texans.

Timon's Ministries in Corpus Christi set up the donation of about 75 pounds of shark meat.

Executive director Kae Berry tells the San Antonio Express-News that the 12-foot, seven-inch shark was the biggest fish ever donated to the center.

Feast for all: An 809-pound tiger shark caught in the Gulf of Mexico has been cooked and served to more than 90 homeless Texans - here the fish is seen with Ryan Spring who spent seven hours reeling it in

A volunteer chef breaded and baked the meat.

Fisherman Ryan Spring of San Antonio had said he caught the shark on August 3 after reeling it in for more than seven hours.

'It was a hard fight the whole time,' Spring told KRLD radio.

'I was wondering, "What do I have on here?" I just had to push through - dig down and find that energy to keep going.'

Nearly a dozen men were needed to haul the big fish out of the water.

The catch falls short of the tiger shark state record, which according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, is 1,129 pounds.

Spring says he caught seven sharks the day before - including an eight-foot bull shark - but decided to free them all.

He donated the tiger shark to Timon's Ministries and Ms Berry said the volunteer chef did a great job preparing the food and 'most people really enjoyed it.'

The center says there are enough leftovers to serve up some shark stew next week.
