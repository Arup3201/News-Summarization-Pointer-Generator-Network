Former Chelsea boss Ruud Gullit has revealed that the feud between Robin van Persie and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar has resurfaced, and it's damaging Holland's squad.

The Dutch legend claimed the pair's relationship has been strained ever since the 2010 World Cup, and said old problems came to the surface in Holland's recent 3-1 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Kazakhstan.

The Manchester United forward and Huntelaar, who plays for Schalke, have competed for a starting spot in the national side for the best part of a decade, with successive managers failing to find a system that can fit both in at the same time.

Now, the tensions caused by this competition have reached boiling point once more. 

'There has been irritation between them since the 2010 World Cup in South Africa,' Gullit told The Mirror.

'It was simmering at Euro 2012 and it all exploded. The problems have far from disappeared.

'Huntelaar was mouthing off again against Kazakhstan and his old confrontation with Van Persie surfaced straight back up.'

Guus Hiddink's side are currently third in their qualifying group, six points behind both the Czech Republic and Iceland, who they lost to 2-0 in their last qualifier.
