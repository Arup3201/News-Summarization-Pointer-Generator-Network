Labour MP Margaret Hodge has been accused of striking a cyclist with her car door while talking on her mobile phone.

The former children’s minister was canvassing in Barking, East London, when she swung open the door into the path of an overtaking cyclist, who crashed into it.

Witness Paul Ayer, 48, who took the photograph of Mrs Hodge with the cyclist, said he saw the MP using her mobile phone while she was opening the door of the parked car.

Mr Ayer claims Mrs Hodge was using the mobile phone when she opened the door.

He took photographs on his mobile phone of the aftermath and says a man 
who was with Mrs Hodge and described himself only as a ‘councillor’ 
suddenly became ‘aggressive’.

Mr Ayer said: ‘I’m sure she had the phone by her head and was on it when she opened the door, but she denies it.

‘I was driving home from work and was just by my house when I could see a
car door opening onto the road while a cyclist was about to pass.

‘I was driving towards the vehicle and slowed down because I could already predict there was going to be a collision.

‘The cyclist just slammed into the car and fell into my half of the 
road. I quickly pulled over and took out my phone to record the incident
in case he was seriously hurt.

‘There was damage to his bike, the chain had come off and his light had been smashed with the debris on the road.

‘Margaret was at first shocked and left it to her passenger to check he 
was not hurt, but was later very apologetic. The cyclist said he was 
alright and was just a bit shook up.

‘The guy was a real gentleman and accepted it was an accident. A lot of 
people would have tried to make more of it in today’s compensation 
culture.'

Although the cyclist was not seriously hurt, his bike was left damaged and broken pieces of its smashed front light were left in the road.

The door to Mrs Hodge’s silver Toyota Prius was warped out of shape due to the impact hitting it back on its hinges.

Mrs Hodge said: ‘It was a very stupid thing to do. I was incredibly apologetic and fortunately the man was not hurt.

'He accepted my apology and we shook hands. I was holding my phone as I got out of the car but I was not using it.’
