Jeffrey Demond Williams was put to death in Texas for the 1999 murder of a police officer last night

A man who murdered a police officer was executed in Texas last night, using his last words to accuse police of 'killing innocent kids'.

Jeffrey Demond Williams, 37, received a lethal injection just over an hour after his last-day appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court failed.

Asked to make a final statement before his death, Williams spoke quickly and angrily.

'You clown police,' he said, accusing them of 'killing innocent kids, murdering young kids.'

'Y'all are getting away with murder all the time,' he continued. 'When I kill one or pop one, y'all want to kill me.'

He finished by saying: 'God has a plan for everything.

'I love everyone that loves me, I ain't got no love for anyone that don't love me.'

He briefly picked up his head as the lethal drug took effect, then took several deep breaths and began gently snoring, reports the Associated Press.

Williams was pronounced dead at 6:36pm CDT, 26 minutes after the lethal drug was administered.

He becomes the sixth prisoner to be put to death in Texas this year.

Williams' lawyers had appealed to the nation's highest court to block the punishment after lower courts rejected their arguments that Williams was failed by his previous attorneys.

Williams was convicted of fatally shooting 39-year-old Houston officer Troy Blando while Blando was handcuffing him on May 19, 1999.

Williams shot Blando with a gun he had tucked under his shirt. Blando was watching a motel where car thefts were suspected when he saw Williams drive up in a Lexus that was reported stolen in a carjacking nine days earlier.

Prosecutors say that after shooting Blando, Williams fled the scene but only made it about a block before he was captured. Blando's cuffs were hanging from one of his wrists.

'I have no sympathy for him,' said Ray Hunt, president of the Houston Police Officers Union.

'Continuing to the very end ridiculing the police just shows what kind of thug he is.'

Hunt joined dozens of officers and supporters, several on roaring motorcycles, outside the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Huntsville Unit while the execution was carried out inside.

In their final pleas for clemency, Williams' attorneys said their client received 'grossly deficient' counsel early on in the appeals process because his previous did not address the poor work by his trial representatives,

Attorneys for the state opposed any delay, contending Williams' arguments were rejected by the courts, including the Supreme Court, in earlier appeals.

Williams' fingerprints were found on the Lexus and also on Blando's vehicle, evidence showed.

When arrested, Williams was carrying the 9mm pistol determined to be the murder weapon.

At his trial, his lawyers tried to show Williams was unintelligent, had emotional problems and did not deserve to die.

Evidence showed Williams gave investigators five taped confessions the day he was arrested.

Williams said he fired in self-defense, feared Blando could have been a carjacker and didn't know Blando was an officer.

In another confession, he acknowledged that he knew he was shooting a policeman.

Court records show Blando, although in plain clothes, was carrying his badge around his neck.

'Troy was a great investigator,' said Jim Woods, who worked with Blando in the police auto theft division.

'He had a great wealth of knowledge, was very dedicated. He'd take on the hard cases as well as the easy ones.

'He loved to go out and chase car thieves. Unfortunately, that was probably his demise.'

Testimony and confessions also linked Williams to four robberies, another shooting and an attempted robbery.

Williams became the 498th Texas prisoner put to death since the state resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982. At least eight others have executions scheduled in the coming months.
