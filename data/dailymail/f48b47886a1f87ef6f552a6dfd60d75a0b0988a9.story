Rail minister Claire Perry has attacked the 'goodies' being offered to Scotland to keep it in the Union

Two-thirds of English MPs want generous subsidies to Scotland to be axed if the country voted to stay in the UK.

David Cameron sparked fury among Tory MPs this week by pledging to keep the controversial Barnett formula, as part of a desperate bid to persuade Scots to vote No to independence.

Even his ministers were last night in open revolt over the issue, with Transport Minister Claire Perry warning the Prime Minister to stop handing out ‘financial party bags’ to Alex Salmond.

The formula, which has been the source of resentment for years, means that public spending per head is £1,623 a year higher in Scotland than in England.

A poll last night revealed that 63 per cent of English MPs now want to axe the formula.

The survey, by Dods Polling, found this included 83 per cent of Conservatives, 41 per cent of Labour MPs and 78 per cent of Liberal Democrats.

Mrs Perry broke cover before the polls in Scotland had even closed to warn against handing ‘goodies’ to Edinburgh without also introducing a fairer deal for England.

Writing in her local paper, the Wiltshire Gazette, she said it is likely that Parliament will be recalled in the coming days to debate the fallout from the vote. 

She added: ‘If the result is a narrow No, this will be a running sore in politics for years to come with demands from Holyrood every few years for another go at the question. 

'If there is a proposal to allow devolution of local taxation, as well maintaining the current level of funding as a dollop from the UK Parliament, then that can hardly be equitable for those of us in all other areas in the non-Scottish Union.’

Defence minister Anna Soubry also acknowledged yesterday that greater devolution to Scotland ‘will cause controversy in Wales and England’. 

Many MPs believe Mr Cameron made a mistake by agreeing to keep the Barnett formula under pressure from Gordon Brown. They are also pressing for Scottish MPs to be barred from voting on English matters, particularly if Scotland is handed new powers over tax and benefits.

Tory MP Anne-Marie Morris said Mr Cameron’s policy to offer Scotland devo max was ‘not thought through, and is concerning many of my constituents who feel it is unfair’.

David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg signed a joint declaration promising to devolve more powers to Scotland in the event of a 'No' vote

Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said neither the party nor the public would accept a devolution deal that fails to address English concerns. 

He said: ‘The devolution settlement introduced by Labour was unbalanced and created two different classes of MP.

‘That should have been corrected already in the interest of democracy and fairness.’

Government sources insist Mr Cameron is ‘very aware’ of the anger over the so-called ‘English question’. He is expected to come forward with proposals to curb the voting rights of Scottish MPs as part of any new devolution settlement.

But several Tory MPs warned that they could throw out the entire plan to hand greater powers to Scotland unless the Barnett formula is also scrapped.

Tory MP Christopher Chope said: ‘The party leaders don’t have the authority to make a bribe on behalf of the people of the UK.

‘Taxation is an issue for Parliament. We don’t legislate by presidential-style decree.’

Ed Miliband was last night facing criticism over his shambolic No campaign, amid reports that 30 per cent of Labour supporters are poised to vote Yes – up from 18 per cent last month.

The Labour leader spent the final week of the campaign touring Scotland. But he was escorted to safety this week after being jostled by Yes supporters during a trip to an Edinburgh shopping centre. 

He then pulled out of two events on the closing day of campaigning. And Mr Miliband’s poor personal ratings in Scotland mirror his ratings in England, despite low levels of Scottish support for the Conservatives.

Henry McLeish, the former first minister of Scotland, said the No campaign led by the Labour leader had been negative and disorganised, adding: ‘If it is a no vote, Gordon Brown will have been largely responsible for that. If it’s a Yes then there will be a lot of questions.’
