She won a cult following thanks to her hapless alter-ego’s constant gaffes and disastrous love life.

But comedienne Miranda Hart has announced there will be no more episodes of her hit BBC sit-com - because she wants the character to ‘be happy in herself’.

The 41-year-old said the show - called Miranda - will end after two Christmas specials are aired, leaving her free to concentrate on other projects.

She told Radio 2 DJ Steve Wright: ‘ I’m actually coming to the end of the whole sitcom. I’m doing two Christmas specials but they are going to be the finale of the show full stop. It went alright and that was part of the reason to end it, was to end it on a high.

‘It’s going to be really emotional I think, for all of us, but at the same time it feels the right time to end it. Because I think the character – people have loved her so much, which is so nice, and amazing for me – but I want her to come into her own now.

‘As the gets older I don’t want her to keep falling over and making a complete fool of herself. I want her to be happy in herself.’

Miss Hart, who also stars in BBC drama Call The Midwife, said she stars in an upcoming Hollywood film called Spy, but is not sure if she will make the transition to Los Angeles as an actress.

She said: ‘I take a day at a time and see what happens. I’m a bit scared of all that meeting thing in LA. 

'Apparently they just shower you with compliments and tell you you’re the best thing ever, which I would feel embarrassed and awkward about, and then you go and it’s all nonsense.’

Next move? It is rumoured that Miranda, pictured on the Graham Norton Show this week, would present a remake of classic slapstick entertainment show The Generation Game, which first aired in 1971

Earlier this year it was rumoured she would present a remake of classic slapstick entertainment show The Generation Game, which first aired in 1971 and was hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth, Larry Grayson and others over the course of its three-decade life-span.

Miss Hart confirmed she was considering a similar format, but insisted the details have not yet been finalised. She said: ‘I am thinking about an entertainment format, yes. But that literally is what it is at the moment.

‘There might be elements of the Generation Game. I’m deciding what bits to take. We are thinking how could the Generation Game possibly work in 2015. It takes a while to work that all out.’
