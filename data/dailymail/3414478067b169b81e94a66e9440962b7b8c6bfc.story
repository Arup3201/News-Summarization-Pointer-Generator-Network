Luciano Becchio has been ruled out for two months with a fractured heel.

The Argentine is on loan at Rotherham from from Norwich and has scored twice in five games prior to falling awkwardly in a behind closed doors friendly. He was hoping to line up against former club Leeds United on Friday.

Manager Steve Evans has confirmed: 'Regretfully the player will be out injured for at least six weeks with a fractured heel. The player picked up this injury in a behind-closed-doors match, at a point when no player was near him and he twisted to make a run in the opposite direction.

'The player was x-rayed straight after the match, which showed no damage, but a further scan on Friday morning diagnosed the hairline fracture.

'Our dialogue with Norwich City in relation to the player will continue to ensure we get the player back playing at the earliest opportunity.'
