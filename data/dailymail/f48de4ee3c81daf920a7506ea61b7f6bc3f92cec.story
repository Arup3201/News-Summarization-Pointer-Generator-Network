Prince William has been branded a 'conqueror' by Argentina ahead of his deployment to the Falkland Islands as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot.

The comment came with tensions running high over the disputed islands, which Buenos Aires calls Las Malvinas.

Yesterday the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that one of the Royal Navy’s most advanced new warships is being sent to the area.

Strong words: Prince William has been branded a 'conqueror' by Argentina ahead of his deployment to the Falkland Islands as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot

Britain is sending the £1billion Type 45
destroyer Dauntless on a seven-month deployment to the South Atlantic 
while Buenos Aires ratchets up pressure over sovereignty of  the 
islands.

The vessel, which bristles with fearsome anti-aircraft weapons, will 
patrol the coastline during celebrations to mark the liberation of the 
islands 30 years ago.

However, the MoD stressed that the March mission was routine and a Royal Navy spokesman rejected suggestions the decision to send the ultra-modern destroyer to the region represented an escalation of the UK’s position.

'The Royal Navy has had a continuous presence in the South Atlantic for many years. The deployment of HMS Dauntless to the South Atlantic has been long planned, is entirely routine and replaces another ship on patrol,' he said.

Heightened tensions: Argentine president Cristina Fernandez and David Cameron have recently engaged in a diplomatic war of words over the sovereignty of the islands

Tensions between the two countries have heightened with the approaching 30th anniversary of the 1982 Falklands conflict, which cost the lives of 255 British and 649 Argentine servicemen.

Following Argentina's remarks, General Sir David Richards the Chief of the Defence Staff denied that sending the Duke to the Falkland Islands was designed to provoke the country

In December, the Mercosur grouping of countries, which includes Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Paraguay, announced that it would ban ships sailing under the Falkland Islands flag from docking at their ports.

David Cameron and Argentine president Cristina Fernandez have previously accused each other of 'colonial' behaviour.

Referring to the deployment of HMS Dauntless and William’s tour of duty as an RAF search and rescue pilot, Argentina’s Foreign Ministry last night said it 'rejected the British attempt to militarise (the) conflict.'

It also expressed regret that an heir to the throne would arrive wearing 'the uniform of a conqueror.'

'Governments should avoid the temptation of falling into a discourse ... that aims to distract public attention from belt-tightening economic policies,' the ministry said in a statement.

Argentine official Sebastian Brugo Marco last year said the country could not ignore the 'political' implications of William’s deployment.

'It is one more provocative act that shows Britain’s military presence in a zone of peace where there is no armed conflict,' he said.

Following his remarks, the Chief of the 
Defence Staff denied that sending the Duke to the Falkland Islands was 
designed to provoke Argentina.

General Sir David Richards dismissed the claims, saying: 'I can absolutely tell you it wasn’t and isn’t designed to be.'

Prince William, a Flight Lieutenant with the RAF, will deploy to the remote outcrop in the South Atlantic for six weeks to fly search and rescue helicopter missions.

Gen Richards stressed the Duke of Cambridge's deployment was routine for an RAF Sea King pilot, pointing out Prince Harry was sent to Afghanistan as a forward air controller in 2008.

It has also emerged that UK foreign minister Jeremy Browne will be visiting the islands in June to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the war.

Mr Browne yesterday told the Commons the Government had resisted Tory calls for the Falkland Islanders’ right to self-determination to be written into a new UK law.

He insisted legislation was unnecessary as he stressed the islanders’ ability to decide their own future was 'non-negotiable.'

Tory MP Guy Opperman had called for the islanders’ right to determine their own future to be enshrined in UK law.
