This man is a walking history book.

He has dedicated his body to the memory of the heroes and battles of the Second World War.

Nolan Holmes has spent four years under the needle of a skilled tattoo artist to complete this homage to British and world history.

A mark of respect: Nolan Holmes has dedicated his body to remembrance of the war

Illustrations include battles on the Russian front, the Battle of Britain and the Allied invasion

Beside Churchill and a wartime news report Holmes has now had a memorial poppy added to his tattoo

The mechanic has also had a striking poppy drawn alongside the pictures of conflict ready for this weekend's Remembrance Day.

This Thursday will see the official open of The Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey.

Twenty -six-year-old Nolan has the portraits of Churchill, Monty and even Hitler on his torso.

They go alongside newspaper front pages of the time and the work is not without its touch of humour with comic actor John Cleese's classic moment: 'Do not mention the war,' featured.

The Battle of the Russian Front, the Allies bombing of Germany the exploits of The Few in the airborne Battle of Britain and the German invasion of Poland are etched into Nolan's skin for the rest of his life.

Body of work: Nolan started taking an interest in the war from listening to his grandmother who worked in a bomb factory

Included in the illustrations is John Cleese's 'don't mention the war' scene from Fawlty Towers

Finishing touch: The tattoo series took four years complete

He said: 'I have a family interest in the war.My grandmother worked on the production line for the Wellington bombers in Blackpool.

'She was engaged to a GI who was killed in the D-day landings.

'World War Two has become a huge interest of mine and I study all the books, films and documentaries about the war.'

'I feel the history of the war is dying as the world becomes more politically correct.I have dedicated my upper body as a mark of respect to those who served and those who fell in battle.'

Nolan from Fleetwood added: 'These are not cheap back street drawings they are works of art and show the history of the war. My girlfriend loves them.

'It is not just a fashion stamp like many people have done.It is a huge talking point and makes people remember what went on between 1939 and 1945 a time when this country could have changed forever.

'Now I have had the Poppy done at the most fitting time of the year.

'My personal favourites are Churchill and the Spitfires flying past Tower Bridge.'

Pete Sinclair who has won national awards for his tattoo skills turned Nolan's body into a battlefield.

Pete from Carnival Tattoos based in Thornton Cleveleys, Lancashire said: 'It has been one of most unusual commissions and I enjoyed creating a history book on someone's body especially the action scenes and John Cleese.'
