A Facebook tribute to the little boy

A toddler was killed in front of his mother after a television toppled onto his head as he tried to fetch a ball, an inquest heard.

McKenzie Birkett-Waddington, who was 22-months-old, had spotted his toy in the bottom drawer of the chest which had a heavy set on top.

But as he pulled at the drawer, the chest began to shake and the TV crashed down onto him leaving him with fatal head injuries.

The freak accident happened in Burnley, Lancashire, as McKenzie's mother Jade Birkett, 21, looked on in horror as she tended to her youngest son Kian who had just woken up.

An inquest at Burnley Coroners Court was told that prior to the accident on January 7 the TV had been on the floor in

Miss Birkett's bedroom whilst awaiting an internal ariel before being placed on top of the drawers.

The television was described as a 'heavy old fashioned TV' and not secured to the wall.

The inquest heard how Miss Birkett had moved into the property three weeks prior to her son's death with her two other boys, Mason, now five, and Kian 15 months.

The three-drawer chest had been given to her whilst at her former address and the same television had sat on it 'pushed up against the wall' without problem.

She had said that she thought it was 'firm and stable'.

Much loved: McKenzie with his mother Jade Birkett, who has described him as a 'little diamond'

Bereft: McKenzie's have been left devastated by his death, which a coroner called a 'dreadful accident'

In a statement read to the court Miss Birkett described the events of the fateful morning whilst describing her middle son as a 'very lively, healthy and inquisitive lad'.

She said: 'I was in bed at home and Kian was asleep in his Moses basket. I could hear that McKenzie had woken up and went to his room and got him out of his cot, Mason was sleeping at his grandmother's. I took McKenzie downstairs and waited until Kian woke up.

'At around 9.30 am I heard him wake up and me and McKenzie went back upstairs and I sorted Kian out.'

She told how she put McKenzie on the floor at the foot of the bed where the chest of drawers stood whilst she tended to her other son.

'I put McKenzie down on the floor at the bottom of the bed and went round to deal with the youngest.

'I could hear McKenzie chatting away to himself and I turned to have a look at him and saw he had gone up to the chest of drawers and was standing in front of the chest of drawers. I could see he was pulling at the bottom drawer.

'It was only open very slightly. Before I could do anything the chest of drawers simply dropped forwards and the TV fell on top of him. The drawers did not fall over they just rocked.'

The court heard that Miss Birkett went to his aid and removed the TV but her son was unconscious.

She added: 'I could see when I looked that his toy ball was in the bottom of the chest of drawers, I think he must have been trying to get it. It happened so quickly I did not expect it to happen. I have always had the TV on there before without any problems.'

Miss Birkett called an ambulance and McKenzie was taken to Royal Blackburn Hospital before he was transferred to Manchester Royal Children's Hospital where he sadly died.

As evidence was read out Miss Bitkett sobbed whilst being flanked by her parents.

Describing her son in the statement she said: 'He started to walk when he was 16-months-old and was how they are at that age - into everything.

'He didn't like being told what to do and didn't pay much attention to me, I suppose normal for a lad his age.'

Home Office pathologist Dr Charlie Wilson said that McKenzie had been a 'healthy, normal, 22-month-old boy who had suffered serious head trauma'.

Following the accident, McKenzie was to undergo emergency neurosurgery at the Manchester Royal Children's Hospital but his brain was swollen and he suffered a large hematoma.

He was to suffer a cardiac arrest and could not be revived. The pathologist ruled the cause of death as being head injuries.

Recording a verdict of accidental death East Lancashire Coroner Mr Richard Taylor said: 'It is quite apparent to me that this was an unforeseen, dreadful accident.'
