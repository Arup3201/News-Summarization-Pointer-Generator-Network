Husband-to-be: Thomas Williams, the onetime public face of the Legion of Christ, is getting married Saturday to the mother of his love child

The former public face of the discredited Legion of Christ order who left the priesthood after fathering a love child is getting married this weekend to his son’s mother.

Former clergyman Thomas Williams will walk down the aisle with the daughter of former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See Mary Ann Glendon - one of Pope Francis' top advisers.

Glendon, a Harvard University law professor, is one of the highest-ranking women at the Vatican as president of the Pontifical Academy for Social Sciences.

She is also one of five people on Francis’ commission to reform the scandal-marred Vatican bank.

Her daughter, Elizabeth Lev, is a well-regarded art historian and columnist for the Legion-run Zenit news agency, which Williams published for over a decade while he was in the order.

Williams, a moral theologian, author, lecturer and U.S. television personality, admitted last year that he had fathered a child several years earlier.

At the time, Williams apologized for ‘this grave transgression’ against his vows of celibacy and said he had stayed on as a priest because he hoped to move beyond ‘this sin in my past’ to do good work for the church.

The Legion’s retired superior later admitted he had learned about the child in 2005 but allowed Williams to keep teaching and preaching about morality.

After taking a year off for reflection, Williams left the priesthood in May to care for his son, who suffers from Down syndrome. According to their wedding registry, he and Lev are due to marry Saturday in the U.S.

Lev is an American-born art historian who has lived and worked in Rome since 1997. She has two other children from past relationships.

She had initially denied an affair with Williams, though they frequently were seen together in American expatriate circles in Rome, particularly with visiting U.S. student and Catholic tour groups.

The couple's wedding announcement coincides with a revelation made by the Legion, which admitted Thursday that a superior who was in charge of the bulk of its American priests-in-training for over a decade sexually abused a minor at the Legion’s novitiate in Cheshire, Connecticut.

The Legion said a second accuser had also come forward with an allegation against the Rev. William Izquierdo, who was novice director at the Cheshire school from 1982-1994 and in Ireland before then. Izquierdo, now 85, has dementia.

The Rev. Marcial Maciel founded the cult-like Legion in 1941 in Mexico and oversaw its growth into a large and prominent congregation despite credible reports that he was a drug addict and child molester.

After Maciel’s death in 2008, the Legion admitted that he fathered three children and sexually abused his seminarians.

In 2010, the Vatican took over the 
order and a papal delegate has been overseeing a reform and 
‘purification.’ In January, the Legion will elect a new leadership and 
approve a new set of constitutions.

The
 Legion scandal has been particularly damaging to the Vatican because 
Maciel was held up by Pope John Paul II and his cardinals as a model for
 the faithful, with the order admired for its orthodoxy and ability to 
bring in money and new priests.

Like
 all Legion priests, Williams had been a staunch defender of Maciel. 
When Maciel’s double life became public in 2009, Williams told the 
Catholic ETWN program that the revelations were a ‘very, very hard blow 
to all of us.’

Until he 
left active ministry, Williams was the most publicly prominent priest in
 the 950-strong order. He is the author of such books as 2008’s ‘Knowing
 Right From Wrong: A Christian Guide to Conscience,’ and was a 
commentator for the U.S. broadcaster CBS.

He was the superior of the Legion’s general directorate in Rome in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

The Legion’s revelation about a senior cleric having abused a novitiate was contained in a report on the steps the Legion has taken to address sexually abusive clergy within its ranks and respond to the victims of Maciel.

According to the report by the Legion’s superior, the Rev. Sylvester Heerman, 35 priests have been accused of sexually abusing minors; nine were found guilty and 14 were acquitted in a church trial.

Two had left the priesthood when the allegations were made, so no church sanctions could be imposed, and 10 cases are still under review. In addition, two Legion superiors were found guilty of sexually abusing adults under their case and three were acquitted.

The Legion said the numbers indicate that less than 1 per cent of the 1,133 priests ordained in the 72-year history of the order had been found guilty by a church trial of abuse, and less than 4 per cent had been abused.
