The ex-husband and close friend of an injured Sydney cafe siege hostage has told how she was used as a 'human shield' by the gunman just before the crisis came to a bloody end.  

Louisa Hope, 50, originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, and her mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning.

Self-styled Sheikh Man Haron Monis stormed in around 9:30, withdrawing a pump-action shotgun and holding customers hostage for more than sixteen hours.

Ms Hope's ex-husband, who preferred to go by the name Tony V, told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday morning that his former partner was injured during the last moments of the siege.

'He'd used her for a human shield for most of the time that she was in there,' said the ex-husband, who used to live in Bondi but now runs a restaurant in South Yorkshire in the United Kingdom. 

'That was just before the young lad was shot when he went to take the gun off the gunman.'

The dramatic siege - considered a terrorist event according to New South Wales Police Force protocols - came to an end around 2am on Tuesday morning when hostages attempted a mass escape and cafe manager Tori Johnson attempted to grab Monis' weapon. 

Monis was falling asleep but woke up as the escape was underway.  'He [Monis] had dozed off. He was falling asleep,' Tony said.

'Some rustling noises had woke him when the lad was trying to take the gun off him. 

'That's when [Johnson] was shot. Apparently that's when my ex-mother-in-law [Robyn] was then shot in the shoulder and that's when the police then went in... and that's when Louisa was shot in the foot.'

Two people - Johnson and barrister and mum-of-three Katrina Dawson - were killed and at least four people were injured and taken to hospital.

Ms Hope's ex-partner, who spoke to family on Tuesday morning UK time, said the whole incident had been 'very frightening'.

He had some words of support for his injured friend, who he said has been operated on and is recovering in hospital. 

'I'd just give her a hug and just tell her to keep strong,' Tony said. 'She's a strong woman with a lot of faith in God.'
