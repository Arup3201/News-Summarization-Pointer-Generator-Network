NBC Los Angeles reports that police were called in when the parents of an unidentified boy at La Paz Intermediate School in Mission Viejo became suspicious about Roush's relationship with their son.  

They believed it was inappropriate, and contacted investigators several months ago.

Authorities interviewed several witnesses and pulled information from both the alleged victim and Roush's cellphones before making the arrest.
