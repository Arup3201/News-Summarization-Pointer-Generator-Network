A nurse who was left fighting for her life after being trampled by cows was at first branded a hoax caller when she desperately dialled 999 for help.

Sarah Leonard suffered serious injuries including broken arms, a broken collarbone, broken jaw and several broken ribs during the incident in a field near Lincoln last November. 

A recording of her distress call has been shared online, and it reveals how the Lincolnshire Police call handler dealt with the badly injured lady.

The call taker is heard to say 'This is a hoax, isn’t it, obviously', after questioning the woman about where she was and what had happened to her.

But the call wasn’t a hoax. Sarah nearly died and was in intensive care at Lincoln County Hospital for two and a half weeks. The full call, which is 49 minutes long, stops when officers arrive to help her.

Sarah was eventually taken to Lincoln County Hospital.

The woman, who was 59-years-old old at the time, had been out on a hi-tech treasure hunt when she was trampled by cows in a field off Church Lane at North Scarle, eight miles from Lincoln city centre.

She managed to call 999, and was eventually found after police traced her mobile phone signal.

But in a recording of the call, which was posted on Audioboo by BBC Radio Lincolnshire presenter William Wright, Ms Leonard desperately struggles to explain what has happened to her.

After asking Sarah what was happening and getting some broken responses, the call operator asks where in Lincolnshire she is calling from.

The call operator then says: 'This is a hoax, isn’t it, obviously. Which area of Lincolnshire, we will get your mobile phone checked.' 

Critical: Ms Leonard's injuries included broken arms, a broken collarbone, broken jaw and several broken ribs

Sarah was walking in a field with her dog when the group of animals charged, leaving her with life-threatening injuries.  

Now doing research two days a week, a generous Sarah said she did not bear the operator any ill will despite her somewhat unsympathetic tone.

'I presume I couldn't talk properly because of my broken jaw,' she said.

'I broke all of my ribs down my left side I believe, and was in intensive care for two and half weeks.'

Sarah was carrying a hand held GPS but assumes the device was knocked out of her reach by the cows.

'I can not remember, but I think because of all my breaks and everything I was in terrible pain so I probably couldn't move very much either.'

Sarah added: 'It happened in a field, it was a public footpath through a field in North Scarle, near Lincoln. I wasn't actually using my phone, it was a handheld GPS, I think it was a circular walk of about four miles.

'I suffered lots of broken bones, particularly to my arms and chest, so it was both arms, my collar bone, my jaw, most of my ribs on my left side. 

'Somebody said I remembered where I had parked the car and it wasn't far from there,' Sarah said.

'Basically they saved my life.'

Sarah’s pet King Charles spaniel Megs was uninjured after she ran off when around a dozen cows charged at them. Her brother, Andrew, found the petrified dog cowering in a bush the following day.

Most members of the public are wary of bulls, but few realise that cows, particularly those protecting newly-born calves, can also be dangerous.

If you find yourself in a field of suddenly wary cattle, move away as carefully and quietly as possible, and if you feel threatened by cattle then let go of your dog’s lead and let it run free rather than try to protect it and endanger yourself. The dog will outrun the cows and it will outrun you.

Those without canine companions should follow similar advice: move away calmly, do not panic and make no sudden noises. Chances are the cows will leave you alone once they establish that you pose no threat.

If you walk through a field of cows and there happen to be calves, think twice; if you can, go another way and avoid crossing fields.

Sarah, from Norton, Sheffield, had been ‘geocaching’ - an internet-based high-tech treasure hunt which uses GPS.

At the time a Lincolnshire Police spokesman confirmed: 'We received a call from a woman saying she had been injured and was lying in a field.

'She said she had been hurt when cows stampeded and knocked her over.

'Although she didn’t know exactly where she was, within half-an-hour her car was located at North Scarle cemetery.

'And she was found in the field off Church Lane in the village soon after.'

In a statement Lincolsnhire Police said: 'Call takers are trained to establish key information as quickly as possible. 

'The audio clip only covers the initial few minutes of the call and does not give the full picture of how the injured lady was dealt with. 

'The call lasted 48 minutes in total and all the time the caller was being spoken to, background work was going on to try to establish her exact location. 

'There was never any delay in the police’s response to the incident and everything was done with urgency to find where the caller was. Whilst all the work was being undertaken to locate the lady, the call taker kept talking to her to keep her calm and reassured, gaining as much information as possible from her. She was kept on the line until help arrived.'

Geocaching involves hiding a small waterproof box containing a logbook and a pen, recording its co-ordinates and logging its location on a website.

Another ‘cacher’ will see the listing, enter the co-ordinates into their GPS receiver and go in search of it.

It is similar to the 150-year-old game letterboxing, which uses clues and references to landmarks embedded in stories.

Geocaching was invented in 2000 when GPS readings became more accurate.

In total there are two million geocaches all over the world and more than five million people take part in the activity globally.
