According to the Health & Social Care Information Centre, 83 per cent of Britons are showing signs of gum disease

It doesn’t take much to keep your teeth and gums in great shape, yet according to the Health & Social Care Information Centre, 83 per cent of Britons are showing signs of gum disease.

So what can you do to ensure your smile stays in style?

Most of us are aware of the confidence-boosting benefits of a fabulous foundation, mascara or blush, and we’re clearly happy to invest both hard-earned cash and precious time on them.

It’s a rare woman who can make her way through a department store beauty floor without being tempted by the latest cosmetic colours.

However, the amount of money we spend on replenishing our make-up bags may surprise you - recent figures estimate that we’ll each spend an average of £131.20  a year on make-up.

And we spend, on average, around 20 minutes a day applying cosmetics, which equates to over 120 hours every year.

Conduct a quick straw poll around you and you’ll probably find most of us don’t dedicate nearly as much time and effort to our oral health.

INVEST IN YOUR SMILE

So, are you guilty of getting your priorities wrong and leaving the true beauty of your smile at the bottom of the pile? After all, no amount of on-trend lip colour can mask the signs of poor oral health.

In fact, not only can symptoms such as red, swollen gums detract from a radiant smile, but if left untreated, gum disease could have devastating consequences such as tooth loss.

With more than four in five people in the UK showing signs of gum disease, it’s time we refocused some of our efforts to improve our oral hygiene.

And of course, it’s not just women who are guilty of ignoring the telltale symptoms.

According
 to a new survey by MailOnline, only 19 per cent of us would visit the 
dentist if we noticed changes in our gums, compared to 46 per cent who 
would visit when they have trouble with their teeth.

And, astonishingly, almost half of all those questioned have never spoken with their dentist about gum health.

More than four in five people in the UK show signs of gum disease

Gum disease is the swelling, soreness or infection – in varying degrees - of the tissue supporting the teeth.

You may have heard of gingivitis, the name given to the early stage of gum disease, caused by an accumulation of plaque, which contains bacteria that needs to be removed in order to maintain healthy gums.

READ THE SIGNALS

The problem is that many of us don’t recognise the early signs of gum disease: one of the warning signals that you may have gingivitis is redness of the gums around the tooth, and bleeding when you brush your teeth.

MailOnline found that 41 per cent of readers surveyed had experienced bleeding while brushing or flossing, yet one in three said they believed bleeding gums are the result of brushing too vigorously.

But, if ignored and left untreated, gingivitis can lead to the more advanced type of gum disease, periodontitis, which can result in the bone in your jaw decaying, and potential tooth loss.

According to a new survey by MailOnline, only 19 per cent of us would visit the dentist if we noticed changes in our gums, compared to 46 per cent who would visit when they have trouble with their teeth

NHS figures suggest that between 10 and 15 per cent of adults in the UK suffer from severe periodontitis, with many more being affected by mild to moderate levels.

The good news is that most gum disease is preventable and mild cases can easily be treated with an overhaul of your simple daily oral routine.

Don’t wait until you notice bleeding or soreness when you clean, or experience bad breath (halitosis) or a metallic taste in your mouth.

As with all health issues, prevention is far better than cure, so take those vital steps now and you could avoid problems later.

OVERHAUL YOUR ORAL CARE

It's important to clean properly between your teeth, yet according to a MailOnline survey, only two in five of us floss on a daily basis

The first thing you need to consider is how you clean your teeth. It may seem obvious, but many of us have neglected to learn efficient and effective brushing methods, and have simply continued with our childhood technique, often slipping into sloppy habits.

As with most areas of our lives, tooth care technology has vastly improved over recent years.

Toothpaste formulas have changed dramatically to include multi-tasking active treatments that not only clean but care for your teeth on a daily basis.

Even if your water supply contains fluoride, it’s worth using toothpaste which also contains this mineral, which helps protect against tooth decay.

Ask your dentist or hygienist for their recommendation, as they will be able to offer expert advice on the best products to deliver optimum benefits for you.

It’s important to make regular visits to a dental hygienist, as they can help remove stubborn tartar – hardened plaque – with a regular ‘scale and polish’, and monitor your oral wellbeing.

If you’re not sure how frequently you should see a hygienist, your dentist will make a recommendation based upon your general oral health.

BRUSH UP ON YOUR BRUSHING TECHNIQUE

While you are talking with your hygienist, tap into their expertise and ask for some guidance on brushing techniques.

Many people are embarrassed to do this, as they feel it is an admission that they have potentially been doing it wrong, but it’s better correct poor habits now than continue and do further damage.

If you’re still using a manual brush, you may find that switching to an electric brush helps clean more thoroughly, and helps to maintain the correct, even pressure – some more expensive brushes even alert you if you’re pressing too hard, to avoid pushing back the gumline and exposing the sensitive tooth root.

Don’t be tempted to move the brush 
around your mouth constantly, though. Let the rotating brush head do all
 the work for you, and simply move from one tooth to another after a few
 seconds.

It should 
take approximately two minutes to clean all your teeth – if it helps, 
set a timer on your smartphone, and spend 30 seconds on each quarter of 
your mouth, morning and night.

Using a daily mouthwash can help control the build-up of plaque and protect against bacteria

Again, your hygienist will be able to advise on which type of brush head is best suited to your needs, and areas you really need to focus on.

For example, some patients find one side of their mouth is healthier than the other, as they’ve cleaned more enthusiastically if they are left or right-handed.

RINSE YOUR MOUTH OUT & GET FLOSSING

Use a daily mouthwash to help control the build-up of plaque and protect against bacteria.

If you think you’re already showing signs of gum disease, talk to your dentist or hygienist, who may suggest you use a product containing chlorhexidine, an active ingredient that’s clinically proven to help treat gum disease.

Products containing chlorhexidine are available over the counter, and can be an important weapon in the fight against gum disease.

It’s also important to clean properly between your teeth, yet according to the MailOnline survey, only two in five of us floss on a daily basis.

So, if you’re not doing it every day already, use floss, tape or small interdental brushes (they come in different sizes, so seek advice on which you need, which will depend on how tightly packed together your teeth are) to remove all remaining food debris and plaque from those crevices between your teeth.
