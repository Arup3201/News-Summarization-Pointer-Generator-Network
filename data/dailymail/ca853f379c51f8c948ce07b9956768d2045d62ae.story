Former French justice minister Rachida Dati faces jail if she returns to her native Morocco after naming the father of her baby born in 2009

France's glamorous former justice minister Rachida Dati is facing jail if she returns to her family's native Morocco for having a child out of wedlock.

The 47-year-old MEP has been warned she risks up to a year behind bars for breaking the Muslim state's strict 'morality code'.

The one-time French cabinet minister this week finally revealed who fathered her three-year-old daughter Zohra, and is taking him to court to force him to recognise paternity.

She has named luxury hotels tycoon Dominque Desseigne, 68, as the man who got her pregnant but the admission could now cost her her freedom if she ever returns to Morocco, where her father M'Barek Dati was born and she still has dozens of relatives.

Moroccan public prosecutor Adil Fath has written to justice minister Mustapha Ramid asking for her to be arrested if she sets foot in the country, the Moroccan media revealed.

Dati - a french citizen born in France - is in breach of article 490 of the Moroccan penal code, which stipulates from one month to one year in prison for anyone who has sexual relations out of wedlock.

The ex-minister put an end to four years of speculation this week by finally revealing who fathered her child and solved a mystery that had left two of Europe's former leaders under suspicion.

Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy and ex-Spanish premier Jose-Maria Aznar had both been named as among Dati's string of lovers.

The man named by Dati as the father, 
multi-millionaire Mr Dessiegne - boss of the Lucien Barriere hotel chain
and one of France's richest men - has so far to refused to make any 
comment on Ms Dati's claims that he is the father.

Mystery solved: Dati (left in 2009) named luxury hotels tycoon Dominque Desseigne (right) as the father putting an end to four years of speculation but the admission may put her behind bars if she returns to Morrocco for breaking the Muslim state's strict 'morality code' which forbids sexual relations out of wedlock

His name never emerged when the scandal over the possible father of the child erupted in 2008.Former Spanish Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar threatened legal action after Moroccan news site L'Observateur named him as the father.

Other potential fathers named in a 
frenzy of media speculation, included President Sarkozy himself, his 
brother Francois and the chief prosecutor of the Arab state of Qatar, 
Ali Al Marri.

Named as lover: There was media speculation that former French president Nicolas Sarkozy (pictured with Dati in 2007) was the father. He used to call her 'my little Arab girl' and invited her to join his election campaign which he went on to lose in May

Former French First Lady Carla Bruni was said at the time to have accused Dati of 'sleeping her way to the top'.

She was so jealous that her husband may have had a relationship with Dati that she demanded she be fired, it was reported.

Sarkozy later ordered Dati to quit her justice ministry job and stand as an MEP.

The ex-president later invited Dati - who he used to call 'my little Arab girl' - to join his election campaign team this year hoping she would boost his appeal among France's large Muslim population but Sarkozy went on to lose the election to socialist Francois Hollande in May.

The ex-president later confessed that he regretted not protecting Dati more than three years ago, adding: ‘I believed in her. She has talent.’

She is now at the centre of more speculation she will vie for the leadership of Sarkozy's right-wing UMP party to pave her way for a bid for the French presidency in either four or nine years’ time.
