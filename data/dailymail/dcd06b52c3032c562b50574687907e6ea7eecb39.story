Hundreds of women are being recalled for breast cancer checks amid fears that a bungling junior hospital doctor mistakenly gave them the all-clear.

Letters were last week sent to 272 patients who underwent routine breast screening over 18 months from January 2011.

The women, who were originally told follow-ups were not required, have been asked to return to The Royal Bournemouth Hospital in Dorset for further checks after a male junior doctor there failed to carry out correct procedures at their screening sessions.

Royal Bournemouth Hospital, where around 250 women attended breast screenings that may not have been carried out properly. Consultants at the Dorset hospital raised concerns over a junior doctor

The unnamed medic is now under 
investigation over his alleged lapse following complaints about his 
performance at the clinic up to July 2012.

Consultants who run the breast clinic
raised the alarm as they were unhappy with the way the doctor conducted
his initial assessment of some of the patients.

Hospital bosses said his work 
‘potentially did not meet our usual high standards’ and stressed that 
the recall was ‘precautionary’.

A spokeswoman for The Royal Bournemouth declined to name the junior doctor, but said he was no longer working at the hospital.

‘We have no evidence of any harm to 
the patients seen by this junior doctor,’ she said. ‘However, as a 
precaution, we are bringing some patients back for an assessment by a 
consultant. At this stage, we have invited those patients who were only 
seen by this junior doctor.’

Around 250 patients were screened for breast cancer have been recalled for another assessment

The doctor is being investigated by 
the General Medical Council over the incident, the spokeswoman added. 
The hospital has also asked the Royal College of Surgeons to assist in a
review.

Tony Skene, consultant breast surgeon
at The Royal Bournemouth, said: ‘Although we have found no evidence of 
any harm, the safety of our patients is our number one priority.

‘We do, however, realise that for 
those patients who we do recall, this may lead to additional anxiety and
we apologise for the distress that this may cause.

‘The Trust is being proactive with 
this recall, which is about clinical standards. There are no other 
concerns. I want to assure all the patients we contact that they will be
offered a prompt appointment, with access to a support telephone line 
in the interim should they need it.’

Emma Pennery, clinical director of 
support charity Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘While there is currently no 
evidence of any misdiagnosis in this instance, a recall to a breast 
clinic can inevitably cause a great deal of anxiety for both patients 
and their families. We would hope that in such a rare instance, the 
hospital will see these patients as quickly as possible.’

Paula Shobbrook, The Royal 
Bournemouth Hospital’s director of nursing, said extra clinics were 
being arranged so that women affected could be seen as soon as possible.
A telephone hotline is also available for anxious patients seeking 
support. ‘We’re inviting them back to reassure them and so that they can
see one of our consultants,’ she said.

‘We have been reviewing the records carefully and have sent the patients  a letter.

‘We’ve also put on additional clinics so that patients can come back in.’

The NHS Breast Screening Programme is
estimated to save 1,400 lives a year in England alone. One in eight 
women will develop breast cancer at some stage in their life. Eighty per
cent of breast cancers occur in women over 50.

Women aged between 50 and 70 are 
invited for checks every three years. In some areas, this is being 
extended to include those between 47 and 73. Those over 70 can ask to be
screened.

Sally Greenbrook of the charity 
Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: ‘Any variation from the usual high 
standards of breast screening is extremely worrying. We are pleased to 
see that the hospital is acting with urgency in reassuring those 
affected and ensuring that this does not happen again.

‘We hope it doesn’t put women off 
attending their screening appointment, as early detection offers the 
best chance of a successful outcome.’
