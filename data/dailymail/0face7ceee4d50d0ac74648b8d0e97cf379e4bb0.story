Scott Brown has insisted Aleksandar Tonev retains the full support of the Celtic dressing room — despite the Bulgarian being hit with a seven-match ban for racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan.

The 24-year-old winger, on loan from Aston Villa, was hammered by an SFA judicial panel last week over the incident. Celtic officially appealed against the decision and, as things stand, the player is free to play against the Dons at Pittodrie on Sunday lunchtime. No date has yet been set by the SFA for the Appellate Tribunal.

Speaking for the first time about the matter in Bucharest, skipper Brown was adamant that all of Tonev’s team-mates remain squarely behind him.

‘We’ll stick by him as we know he didn’t say it — that’s the main thing,’ Brown said. ‘I didn’t think he needed to explain himself. We know he didn’t say it. We know he doesn’t come in and lie.

‘He speaks to everyone in the changing room.’

Having been rested against Inverness at the weekend because he was not mentally ready, Tonev travelled with Celtic to Romania. 

Manager Ronny Deila looks set to use him at some stage against Astra — but cast doubt on whether he would ask him to play against Aberdeen.

‘We have made the appeal and there is nothing new there,’ Deila said. ‘We believe he is innocent and that it is word against word. We are going to support him.

‘I think Europe is easier for him to play in than Scotland, but this has had an effect on him. It would have on anybody and I feel sorry for him. It is a very hard thing to be accused of. But we are supporting him and I think he will be ready for the game.’

Asked if he’d consider fielding him at Pittodrie on Sunday, Deila said: ‘We’ll see.’

Meanwhile, the Celtic manager insisted he has no concerns about throwing Stefan Scepovic in  after Anthony Stokes pulled out of the trip through illness.

The Irishman checked in at Glasgow Airport but was told to go home after being assessed by the club doctor.

With John Guidetti ineligible for the match in Giurgiu, Scepovic is set to get the nod for the central striking berth ahead of Leigh Griffiths.

‘I’m confident Stefan can come in and do well,’ Deila said. ‘I think he’s played well lately and he’s desperate to play. So that’s good.

‘You see a change in him now that he’s scored a few goals. He’s more confident and he believes there’s much more to come from him.

‘He’ll keep on working hard and look for his next chance.

‘He needs minutes, he’s scored two goals in the last three matches. I hope he can continue that.’

Stokes joins James Forrest and Kris Commons on the absentee list, although goalkeeper Craig Gordon is poised to return to the side after sitting out the victory over Caley Thistle with a minor knee problem.
