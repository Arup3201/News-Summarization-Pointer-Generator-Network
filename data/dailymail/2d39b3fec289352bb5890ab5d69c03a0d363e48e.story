Tragedy: Alicia Williams, 27, and boyfriend David 
Platt died trying to rescue their dog in the 
Clwedog River, North Wales

A couple drowned in a swollen river after apparently trying to rescue one of their dogs from the fast-flowing waters.

Alicia Williams and her fiance David Platt, both 25, had been walking their four pets at a flooded beauty spot when the tragedy happened.

One of their dogs, a whippet, ran to a nearby car wash. A worker there sensed something was wrong and decided to investigate.

He then found the other three dogs – soaking wet and shivering  – and moments later saw Miss Williams’s lifeless body on a sandbank.

Police launched a search and rescue operation and found Mr Platt’s body seven hours later floating 200 yards downstream.

The couple, who had been together for 18 months, regularly walked their pets along the River Clywedog, which flows through the National Trust-owned Erddig Country Estate, near Wrexham.

Locals said the river was 4ft higher than usual after two days of heavy rain.

Car wash worker Michael Morgan, 49, said he was alerted to the accident when the whippet ran over to him just after 5pm on Wednesday.

‘I was kneeling down polishing a car and the next thing I knew there was this dog licking my ear,’ he said.

‘I felt like something wasn’t right so decided to go and look to see if someone had fallen over or got their car stuck in mud.’

He then saw three more dogs – two retrievers and a Jack Russell – sitting beside a Citroen Picasso, which is thought to have belonged to the couple.

‘The whippet was pulling on the rope towards these dogs so I thought he knew them,’ Mr Morgan added.

Danger:
The River Clywedog where the couple drowned. Witnesses said Miss 
Williams' body was lying in the shallow part of the river and said the 
water had been flowing very fast this week

Memory: Tributes have poured in for the couple, 
who lived locally. Miss Williams is pictured in photos from social 
networking sites. It is presumed that the pair drowned but a post mortem
hasn't been carried out yet

He then saw the body of a woman lying on her back. ‘If it wasn’t for the whippet coming over we wouldn’t have realised what was going on, he was definitely trying to tell us something,’ said Mr Morgan.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Pierce, of North Wales Police, said: ‘No one witnessed the couple going into the river, but property belonging to them was found on the river bank. It is only speculation to say they went in after one or more of the dogs. We haven’t got any witnesses to confirm that.

‘The river was in flood, areas of grassland on the banks were covered in water after torrential downpours in this part of North Wales over the last few days.’

The couple lived together in Ruabon, near Wrexham.

Mr Platt’s uncle, Peter Wright, 44, described his farm worker nephew as a ‘strong, lovely lad’. ‘Alicia was a lovely girl and they loved each other very much. They had just got engaged,’ he said.

‘David was the type of lad who would come and give you a hug in the street.’

Bad weather: At the Dorcan Academy, a secondary 
school in Swindon, staff dialled 999 after a schoolboy suffered severe 
burns and went into cardiac arrest when he was hit by the lightning bolt in the car park

Dog
walker Vicci Roberts, of Woof Walkies, took a picture of the fast 
flowing water last night and said:

Elsewhere, a boy was recovering in hospital last night after being struck by lightning.

Joe Compton, 11, was in a Swindon school car park waiting for his grandmother to pick him up when a bolt hit a lamp post he was standing next to. He suffered a heart attack, electric shock and severe burns at 3.15pm on Wednesday. He is now in a stable condition in hospital.

Stuart Arthur, 37, was first at the scene. He said: ‘I heard a horrendous crack and there was a bright white light – I knew then that something was wrong.

‘I ran outside and found the young lad face-down and unconscious. Luckily the training kicked in and we were able to perform emergency procedures on him.’

Scott Sissons, headteacher of Dorcan Academy, where Joe had started school three weeks ago, said: ‘With all the trees around, he was remarkably unlucky to be picked out. I was in my office and saw a phenomenal bolt of lightning go straight to earth followed by a clap of thunder.’

streets in York after the River Ouse burst its banks

Unstable:
Water cascades over the end of a landslip in Newburn near Newcastle. 
Flood water has cut across a road outside the block of flats damaging 
the foundations and leaving the building precariously balanced

Residents
of Spencer Court in Mill Vale have spent the last two nights in 
temporary accommodation after the road outside their block collapsed 
following heavy rainfall leaving the foundations vulnerable and exposed

up: A resident leaves with all the possessions he can carry as he is 
the last one to leave Spencer Court, Newburn after residents were 
evacuated for safety reasons

Pipes
and fallen trees can be seen strewn after floodwater gouged out the 
ground beneath the building which created a massive landslip which 
turned into a waterfall - dubbed the 'Newburn Falls'

Erena Wilson

A woman killed by a falling branch at Kew Gardens was described yesterday as a ‘one-off who was beautiful inside and out’.

Erena
Louise Wilson, 31, an account manager for a film distribution company, 
died instantly from head injuries in the incident on Sunday afternoon.

She
was walking with two friends along a footpath at the Royal Botanic 
Gardens in west London in strong winds and heavy rain when the  
12-inch-thick branch from a 60ft-tall tree fell on to her.

Miss
Wilson was born in Wellington, New Zealand, but lived in Hanwell, west 
London, with her boyfriend, who was not with her at the time of the 
accident.

Her parents, who live in New Zealand, said they were ‘trying to come to terms with our loss’.

Onlookers
and paramedics were unable to save her because she died instantly from 
'non-survivable head injuries', West London Coroner’s Court heard.

Friend
Marcus Allan, 42, said: ‘She was a one-off, I have never met anyone 
like her. She was stunning, beautiful inside and out. Everyone loved her
and she had a very dry sense of humour.’

Colleagues
at media firm Deluxe Digital Studios in Southall where she worked have 
also paid tribute to their colleague, originally from New Zealand.

Speaking
outside the inquest, human resources manager Gez Lowry said: 'It is 
difficult to put into words how we all feel following the tragic passing
of our colleague and friend Erena Wilson.

'Whilst
it’s hard to draw any comfort or understanding at this time, Erena’s 
colleagues are trying to focus on the good times they shared with her on
a day to day basis.

'To us Erena was a star.'
