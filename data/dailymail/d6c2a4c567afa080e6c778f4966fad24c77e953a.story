Meetings: Former Downing Street chief of ctaff Sir Jeremy Heywood raised questions about Libor as early as 2008

Britain's most senior civil servant discussed Libor rates with the Bank of England at the height of the financial crisis.

The Bank’s deputy governor Paul Tucker confirmed that one of the Whitehall figures he spoke to about the issue was the then Downing Street chief of staff Sir Jeremy Heywood, who is now the Cabinet Secretary.

Emails released under freedom of information laws show Sir Jeremy privately raised questions about the way Libor was being set during the 2008 banking crisis.

He expressed concern that the rates for borrowing in US dollars were falling faster than those in sterling.

In one email, Sir Jeremy asked Mr Tucker if he had heard that Libor is high ‘because Barclays are bidding it’.

However, at no point do the email exchanges show Sir Jeremy encouraging Mr Tucker to tell Barclays to manipulate its rates artificially.

Other figures Mr Tucker suggested had raised concerns about interbank borrowing rates include Gordon Brown’s private secretary Tom Scholar, another senior Downing Street adviser Sir Jon Cunliffe, and Treasury permanent secretary Sir Nicholas Macpherson.

But he repeatedly denied that any Whitehall officials or Government ministers - including Ed Balls and Baroness Vadera - ever encouraged him to ‘lean on’ Barclays or any other bank to lower its Libor submissions.

Lady Vadera, a Cabinet Office minister who was one of Mr Brown’s closest advisers on the economy, added comments to a note prepared by bankers at UBS entitled ‘Reducing Libor’ that was circulated in Whitehall at the time.

It suggested legitimate ways of reducing the rate using government lending schemes.

Lady Vadera has denied putting any pressure on banks or the Bank to lower Libor. Mr Tucker told MPs: ‘I don’t think that I spoke to Shriti Vadera throughout this whole period at all.’

Labour said Chancellor George Osborne, who claimed last week that Labour figures were ‘clearly involved’ in the rate-fixing scandal, should apologise.

Shadow Chancellor Mr Balls said: ‘It is now absolutely clear that the Chancellor’s allegations last week were totally false and completely without foundation. George Osborne should now publicly withdraw these false allegations and apologise.

‘With the economy in a double-dip recession and our banks in need of serious reform, the country needs a Chancellor who works full-time in the national economic interest.’

A Treasury source said: ‘We’ve been saying all along that we don’t think Tucker or Heywood did anything wrong.

'These emails don’t answer anything about what senior Labour figures knew or were saying in conversations with the banks.

'Labour protests too much. Can they say that no Labour figure was aware of Libor low-balling?

'Can they say no Labour figure implicitly or explicitly condoned it in conversations with the banks? They haven’t been able to so far.’
