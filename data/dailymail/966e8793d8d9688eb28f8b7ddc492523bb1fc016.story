More than 20 pilot whales beached themselves on a South Florida beach on Saturday, triggering a daylong effort by state and national officials, nearby residents and others to save them.

By evening, five pilot whales — two calves and three juveniles — had been transported to Florida Atlantic University’s Harbor Branch Institute for rehabilitation.

The remaining pod had died of natural causes or had to be humanely euthanized, said Allison Garrett, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s fisheries service.

Rescue efforts: Among a pod of 22 pilot whales who beached themselves on Saturday morning along a Florida beach, 17 were unable to be rescued despite local officials and residents aid

Survivors: By Saturday evening two calves and three juveniles were transported to Florida Atlantic University¿s Harbor Branch Institute for rehabilitation, as the sole survivors

'It was not possible to rehabilitate them,' she told the Associated Press.

The pod of 22 whales came ashore on Saturday morning at Avalon Beach State Park in St. Lucie County. They ranged from calves and juveniles to adult whales.

Garrett said it was unclear why the whales became stranded.

'Pilot whales are very social animals,' she added. 'One scenario could be one of the animals was sick. They won’t leave (a sick whale). They'll stay together.'

For this reason, it’s useless to push pilot whales back into the ocean, Blair Mase, stranding coordinator for NOAA’s Southeast Region, told TCPalm.com.

Support: A calf is seen before rescue workers raise the small whale into an awaiting pool of water before transporting them to the Harbor Branch Institute

Reasoning: It was unclear why the whales became stranded though they're known to stay together, till death do they part, if one of them falls sick

‘If you push them into the water, they'll just keep coming back and stranding themselves again,' said Mase, who was surfing in the area when he noticed people running toward the beached whales.

TCPalm.com reports that hundreds of residents came to the beach to assist with the rescue, helping the animals turn upright so they could breathe better. Volunteers covered the whales with moist towels and poured water over them. Red Cross volunteers helped ensure that volunteers stayed hydrated in the hot sun.

'I think that people want to help animals,' said Jacqui Thurlow-Lippisth, a Harbor Branch volunteer who worked with others to tend to juveniles in a shaded inflatable pool. ‘Especially whales and dolphins, because they are our counterparts in the seas. They’re mammals, they’re intelligent, they’re social. They’re a lot like us.'

Hospice: Officials and volunteers spent the day assessing the health of the whales to see which could be rehabilitated, and then making the others comfortable

Still, there was a sad undercurrent to the efforts, with rescuers aware that most of the whales were dying.

Garrett said there was no obvious sign of trauma or injury to the whales, but that necropsies would be performed on them. She said officials and volunteers spent the day assessing the health of the whales to see which could be rehabilitated, and then making the others comfortable.

She said the last such beaching in the area came in May 2011, on the Florida Keys.

Fatalities: The remaining bodies were seen along the shore following rescue attempts, with them wrapped in towels and blankets

Investigation: Necropsies are planned to be performed on the the 17 whales that didn't survive
