Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, Leonardo’s Last Supper... now we have Joanna Jamieson’s Buckfast Abbey mural.

The 79-year-old nun has followed in the footsteps of the masters by completing a stunning 26ft by 18ft art work depicting monks rebuilding the abbey in Devon.

Over three years, and in between bouts of hip surgery, Mother Joanna worked tirelessly, painting for six hours a day, every day – apart from Sundays, of course.

The result is a spectacular arch-shaped mural made up of 20 wooden panels.

Mother Joanna, who trained as a mural painter at the Glasgow School of Art in the 1950s before becoming a nun, was commissioned to create the piece as part of the celebrations for the abbey’s millennium in 2018.

Although she is based at Stanbrook Abbey in Wass, North Yorkshire, the monks at Buckfast found out about her talents through the Benedictine order which encompasses both communities.

This is a stupendous work: Accomplished, confident, beautifully planned and executed. It fits with distinction into the great tradition of mural painting that has been a feature of British art over the last 100 years in the hands of Stanley Spencer and Charles Mahoney.

There are great precedents, such as Fra Angelico, the Renaissance master who painted devotional images on the walls of the cells of fellow monks.

Working within a great tradition, the artist cleverly adopts from the modern movement just what she required. And so this remarkable mural is just what such a work ought to be: Truly timeless.

In 2011 she took possession of the 
panels, which she laid out on the floor of the village hall in Wass – 
the only space available for a project so ambitious.

Mother Joanna painted the work in acrylic, often using a palette knife instead of a brush.

As she progressed, she was forced to pause for three operations and turned to friend Sister Mary Stephen, 83, herself an artist and a former art teacher, for help with practical tasks, such as mixing paint.

Together they made the deadline at the end of last year.

Yesterday Mother Joanna said: ‘It has pushed me to the limit both physically and mentally but there has been a lot of enjoyment in it as well. It really has got to be the project of my life.’

The mural, in Buckfast’s 360-seat Grange restaurant, is due to be unveiled next month. Abbot David Charlesworth, who commissioned the work, said: ‘It is a monumental effort.’
