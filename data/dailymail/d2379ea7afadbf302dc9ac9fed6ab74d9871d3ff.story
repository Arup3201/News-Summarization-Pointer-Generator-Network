Vice President Joe Biden was heckled by a group of immigration reform activists during a speech he gave this evening to a gathering of progressives.

Midway through Biden's remarks to the roughly 3,000 attendees of the annual Netroots Nation conference, protestors began chanting, 'Stop deporting our families,' at the Obama administration official.

'Let's take these one issue at a time, OK,' Biden angrily shouted at the hecklers, who interrupted him as he was talking about the prevalence of sexual assault on campus.

'I respect your view, and I share your view, but let me take these issues one . . .'Biden tried to say moments later but was cut off by the protesters' chanting.

Vice President Joe Biden's speech to progressive activists attending the Netroots Nation conference in Detroit, Michigan, this evening was interrupted by immigration reform activists who were upset with the government for deporting illegal immigrants

As they were escorted out the event, the activists encouraged the audience to cheer for their cause.

When attendees near the protestors began to clap, Biden joined in.

'You should clap for those young people,' the vice president said, 'because if you were a member of a family... you should clap for them.'

With the speaker's permission, the entire audience began to clap wildly for the hecklers.

'Can you imagine the pain, the anxiety, of coming home every day and wondering whether or not you're mother or father will still be there?' Biden asked the audience.

'Can you imagine, can you imagine what it must feel like?'

Once the clapping had died down, Biden returned to his original remarks.

A few minutes later he returned to the topic of immigration, arguing that having compassion is the 'moral' thing to do.

'The constant flow of immigration, from the founding of our country, has been the primary source of our ability to constantly remake ourselves as a nation.'

This was the first time the Vice President had given remarks at the annual conference, held this year Detroit, Michigan. Biden and other Democratic presidential candidates were invited to participate in a candidate forum at the gathering in 2007 but then-Senator Biden declined to attend.

Biden spoke this year on behalf of the White House.

In the past the president has addressed the conference via video, but Netroots spokeswoman Mary Rickles said he would not be giving remarks of any kind this year.  

During his trip to Detroit, Biden also met with students who participate in an accelerated learning program that trains workers for information technology

In introducing Biden, Netroots Nation board member Arshad Hasan praised the Vice President for putting gay marriage on the table in 2012 by admitting during an appearance on Meet the Press that he supported giving same-sex couples the same marital rights as heterosexual couples.

'We give Barack Obama credit for changing the dialogue on marriage equality around the country,' Hasan said. 'I give Joe Biden credit for changing the dialogue in the White House.'

Biden said he was 'flattered' by the laudatory introduction, however, his comments on Meet the Press were not planned.

'But when I get asked a direct question, I give a direct answer,' he said.

'There's not a way on God's green earth that I can sit there and be asked a question about the civil rights issue of our day and remain silent. It would have been a lie of who I am.'

Biden assured activists that even though President Barack Obama had not yet publicly throw his support behind the cause at the time of the incident, 'the president fully agreed with me.'

'It was a tactical difference possibly within the White House as to how it went, but you know, enough is enough.'

Biden revealed that when he came back from his television interview and went to see the president, Obama gave him a big hug as soon as he entered the room and told him, ' "You said two things that you weren't gonna to change if I brought you on. One was you weren't gonna wear any funny hats and two, you weren't going to change your brain." '

The Vice President said the real credit on this issue goes to the LGBT community for having the 'courage to come out.'

'I didn't free the LGBT community,' he said. "What you all did, what they did, was free every straight woman and straight man in this country.

'It used to be that the vast majority of the American people who were not at all homophobic felt intimidated if they stood up,' Biden claimed, but now many Americans across the country feel comfortable saying they support same-sex marriage.

'It's made America better all across the board. So I say thank you to the gay community,' Biden said.
