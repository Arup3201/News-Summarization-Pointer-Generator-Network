Police departments across the U.S. are warning officers to wear bulletproof vests, not to patrol alone and to avoid making arrests 'unless absolutely necessary' after two NYPD cops were shot dead inside their patrol car this weekend.

It came as New York City's mayor, Bill de Blasio, begged protesters to stop their activities while the city and police department recovers. 

The slayings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu on Saturday afternoon in Brooklyn heightened fears about the safety of law enforcement officials nationwide, though there is no evidence any threats are imminent.

It came as NYPD Commissioner BIll Brattom and de Blasio appeared together to praise the work of the NYPD, and call for protests to be suspended until the murdered officers' funerals can take place later this month. 

The gunman, 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, had inflamed tensions by vowing in in an Instagram post to put 'wings on pigs' as retaliation for the recent slayings of black men at the hands of white police.

Brinsley was black; the slain New York Police Department officers were Hispanic and Asian.

After the deaths, a union-generated message at the NYPD warned officers that they should respond to every radio call with two cars - 'no matter what the opinion of the patrol supervisor' - and not make arrests 'unless absolutely necessary'.

The president of the detectives union told members in a letter to work in threes when out on the street, wear bulletproof vests and keep aware of their surroundings.

Another directive warned officers in Newark, New Jersey, not to patrol alone and to avoid people looking for confrontations.

At the same time, a memo from an NYPD chief asked officers to limit their comments 'via all venues, including social media, to expressions of sorrow and condolence'.

Trainees in the NYPD academy have also been warned not to be seen in their uniforms in case it makes them a target, ABC News reported. 

In Philadelphia, Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey urged the leaders of protests over the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown to 'call for calm and not let this escalate any further.'

In Boston, Police Commissioner William Evans said police issued an alert to officers to warn them about the New York City slayings and added that the department had issued several alerts following the decision by the Ferguson grand jury.

Meanwhile in a Monday press conference, Bill de Blasio attempted to put a halt on anti-police protests.

He said: 'It's time for everyone to put aside political debates, put aside protests, put aside all of the things that we will talk about in due time.'

At a news conference in New York on Sunday, Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce detailed Brinsley's long criminal record, hatred for police and the government and apparent history of mental instability that included an attempt to hang himself a year ago.

Brinsley had at least 19 arrests in Georgia and Ohio, spent two years in prison for gun possession and had a troubled childhood so violent that his mother was afraid of him, police said.

He ranted online about authority figures and expressed 'self-despair and anger at himself and where his life was,' Boyce said.

Investigators are trying to determine if Brinsley had taken part in any protests over the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, whose names he invoked in his online threat, or simply latched onto the cause for the final act in a violent rampage. 

The slayings come at a tense time as police nationwide are being criticized following Garner's death in a New York officer's chokehold and Brown's fatal shooting in Ferguson, Missouri. Protests erupted in recent weeks after grand juries declined to charge the officers involved. 

First attack: Shaneka Thompson, 29, was Ismaaiyl Brinsley's first target in his bloody rampage on Saturday

Hours before shooting the officers, Brinsley had shot and wounded his ex-girlfriend, Shaneka Thompson, at her home in Baltimore.

Thompson's neighbor Yevette Seay told The Associated Press that Thompson's screams for help early Saturday jolted her out of bed.

'He shot me! I don't want to die. I don't want to die,' Seay recalled Thompson saying.

Seay called 911 as Thompson lay on the floor, clutching her stomach. Authorities have said Thompson is expected to survive.

After leaving Baltimore, authorities said, Brinsley took a bus north to New York City and used Thompson's phone to write on Instagram: 'They take 1 of ours, let's take 2 of theirs.' He ended the post with references to the Brown and Garner cases.

Once in New York and shortly before he opened fire on the officers, Brinsley walked up to people on the street and asked them to follow him on Instagram, then told them, 'Watch what I'm going to do,' Boyce said.

Then he approached the squad car and fired four shots, killings the policemen. He ran into the subway station and committed suicide.

At the site of the shooting Sunday, a makeshift memorial with an NYPD baseball cap, flowers, teddy bears and candles lay in remembrance of the officers.

Ramos' 13-year-old son, Jaden, said in a Facebook post that Saturday was the worst day of his life.

'Today I had to say bye to my father,' Jaden wrote. 'He was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer. Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help.' 

The grieving son of a New York City police officer shot dead execution style on a Brooklyn street Saturday posted a heart-wrenching goodbye to his slain father to Facebook.

Jaden Ramos, 13, will never see his father Rafael Ramos again after he was murdered along with his partner 'just for being a police officer,' heartbroken Ramos said.

Once given the incomprehensible news, Ramos took to social media to publicly celebrate his adoring father and condemn his cold-blooded killer.

'Today I had to say bye to my father. He was their for me everyday of my life, he was the best father I could ask for. It's horrible that someone gets shot dead just for being a police officer,' Jaden posted.

He continued: 'Everyone says they hate cops but they are the people that they call for help. I will always love you and I will never forget you. RIP Dad.'

It was a somber addendum to an earlier December post in which he honored his dad's 40th birthday.

'Happy birthday to the best dad in the world, you are always there for me even when it's almost impossible,' he wrote December 9. 'We have so many good times it's not even funny, I love you so much.'
