On the market for £1.1million, it is a beautiful stone barn conversion in its own right, boasting 4,000 sq ft of space and sitting in picturesque countryside.

But the property in the grounds of the 15th century Snape Castle also comes with quite a history - because the site was once home to Henry VIII's sixth wife Catherine Parr.

Current owners Emma and Steve Hagues redesigned the property in North Yorkshire after buying it as a derelict barn in 2006 with planning permission.

Mrs Hagues, 35, said: ‘We had workmen in for months after we moved in and that was quite hard because they’d be there from 8am until 5pm every day.

‘I project-managed the work and by September we had the heating on, just in time for the colder weather.’

The property also comes with a 17th century detached former dovecote structure - producing income as a holiday let or providing extra accommodation.

Mrs Hagues said of the dovecote: ‘It has been incredibly successful - it’s very easy to manage and brings in a net profit of around £10,000.’

The home, marketed by estate agents 
Beadnall Copley of Harrogate, sits three miles west of the A1 and three 
miles south of the nearest town, Bedale.

Snape Castle was first built in 1426 when Ralph de Neville, fourth Lord Neville, gave it to his younger son, George Neville, first Lord Latimer.

It was for a brief period owned by King Richard III in the 15th century, while the heir Richard, second Lord Latimer, was still a child.

Most of the castle is now in ruins, but there are two private residences in the South Wing.

Catherine Parr, the last wife 
of Henry VIII, lived at Snape Castle for almost a decade after marrying her second husband John 
Neville, the third Lord Latimer, in 1534.

Her
 first marriage, to Edward Borough, had ended with his death in 1533 - 
and she became a widow again when Lord Latimer died in 1542.

She then left Snape Castle and became King Henry VIII's sixth wife the following year – but he then died in 1547.

Soon after she married her fourth husband Thomas Seymour. But she died after childbirth aged 36 in 1548 in Gloucestershire.

Catherine was step-mother to Henry's children Edward, Mary and Elizabeth.

When her only biological child, a daughter with Seymour, was born in 1548 she named her Mary in honour of her step-daughter.

She has been credited with campaigning tirelessly for the restoration of the line of succession in the new Act of Succession of 1544.

It allowed Mary, then Elizabeth, to take the throne after their brother Edward.
