Federal prosecutors are accusing a former Army marksman of the cold attempted murder of his wife of 35 years who is suffering from dementia. 

Wife Rachel Owens, 55, was staying at a friend's house last month when prosecutors say her husband, 58-year-old Gregory Owens, broke in and shot her and her friend's husband because his mistress threatened to go public with their six-year affair. Both Mrs Owens and the husband survived the attack, though prosecutors wouldn't reveal their conditions. 

While his wife continued to recover from her nearly-fatal injuries, Owens spent New Year's Eve with his girlfriend in Wisconsin, renting a limousine and sure that he had been ruled as a person of interest in the December 12 shooting. 

But authorities arrested the Londonderry, New Hampshire man on Sunday, after amassing damning evidence they say proves he planned the shooting and places him at the scene of the crime.  

Heartless: Gregory Owens, a former Army marksman, was arrested Sunday after prosecutors accused him of shooting his wife and a family friend at this home in Saco, Maine last month 

Double life: Prosecutors say the shooting happened two weeks after Owen's mistress of six years threatened to expose their affair. Above, investigators take evidence at the scene of the shooting 

Owens appeared in Maine federal court for the first time on Monday, dressed in yellow prison garb indicated his status as a maximum-security prisoner, as he was charged with interstate domestic violence and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. 

If convicted of both crimes, Owens could spend the rest of his life in prison.   

The Owens have been married for 35 years, but at least for the last six, Gregory was engaged in an affair with a woman only identified as 'B.W.' in court papers from Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

Owens' job working for a Florida paramilitary company involved travel, so it perhaps didn't raise any alarms to Mrs Owens that he spent so much time away from home. Each month, prosecutors revealed, Owens spent living a double life in Oshkosh with his girlfriend and socializing with her circle of friends.

Two weeks before the shooting however, Owen's mistress became upset when he accidentally called her from New Hampshire and she overheard a conversation with his wife which convinced her that he would never get a divorce. 

The mistress, who was visiting with the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh police chief at the time of the distressing call, allegedly threatened to reveal the affair 'by publishing photos of the two of them together in the local newspaper' according to an affidavit. 

A week before Christmas, Mrs Owen's lifelong friend Carol Chabot picked her up in Londonderry to spend some time at her home in Saco, Maine. 

Shaky alibi: Owens told police that he was at home on the night of the shooting, but they found evidence that shows he may have plotted to kill his wife, and which places him at the scene. Above, The Owens' home in Londonderry, New Hampshire 

Mrs Owen's elderly parents live in the Maine town, and Mrs Chabot thought it would offer Owens a break from caring for his dementia-stricken wife.   

The shooting happened at the Chabot's home in the early hours of December 18, while Mrs Owens was sleeping in one of their guest bedrooms.

Carol rose the alarm when she heard breaking glass around 3am and woke her husband. 

Investigators later found a window into the garage broken, believed to be the intruder's point of entry. 

Her husband Steven Chabot left their bedroom and entered the hall where he first saw the male intruder 'dressed in dark clothing and wearing a ski mask, carrying a handgun at the top of the stair landing'. 

The intruder proceeded to the second guest bedroom where Rachel Owens was sleeping and shot her four times - including once in the back of the head. 

He then chased Mr Chabot, who hid in a closet and tried to call 911. Mr Chabot later told investigators that the masked-man was wearing glasses similar to a pair he had seen Owens wear before.

Mr Chabot was also shot at three times in the arm, shoulder and back as he barricaded himself in the closet. His wife Carol remained unharmed in the attack, hiding underneath a piece of furniture.

According to court documents, Owen's behavior immediately before and after the shooting made him a suspect in the crime.

Footprints at the scene, suspicious Google searches and blood stains also connected Owens to the heinous crime.

Three hours after the shooting, police arrived at Owens home and felt that the hood of his car was warm. They later pulled Owens over as he drove to a convenience store near his home and informed him that his wife had been shot. 

Instead of asking what had happened and how his wife was doing, Owens immediately feigned a heart attack, though he refused to go to the hospital.

He told police that he spent the night at home, working on his computer, and only left once to go get donuts and coffee. 

Security camera footage shows him going to a Dunkin; Donuts at 4:50am. Prior to that he was also captured on a convenience store's CCTV at 12:11am, giving him plenty of time to drive to and from the Chabot's home to commit the crime in between.  

While an analysis of Owens' computer show she was using it at 2:16am, it was also revealed that he looked up how to change the clock on a computer to conceal the actual time it was used early the previous day. They determined that the files had actually been accessed some two hours after the shooting. 

Owens' boss also told police that he asked him to lie and say that they had been video chatting at the time of the shooting. He says Owens is no longer employed at the company, based in Florida.  

In a search of Owen's home and car they also found clothes matching the description of the intruder in a washing machine and blood stains.   

Two 9mm handguns and about 15 rounds of the same 27-year-old ammunition used in the shooting were also found at Owens' house.

Investigators took a cast of a footprint imprinted in a flower bed on the Chabot's property and discovered that it matched Owens' size 11 boots.   

Mrs Owens and Mr Chabot were rushed to Maine Medical Center in the aftermath of the shootings where they both underwent multiple surgeries. It's unclear what condition they are in as prosecutors refused to say, citing privacy.

Instead of dutifully attending to his wife as she continued to recover at the hospital, a confident Owens spent New Year's Eve in Wisconsin with his girlfriend, even renting a limousine.   

He allegedly told his mistress' family and friends that he had been cleared as a person of interest in his wife's shooting, claiming he was in Afghanistan at the time and had a letter to prove it. 

Owens was ordered held without bond on Monday, at least until his next hearing on January 21.
