Girlfriend blacked out: Amateur rugby prop Benjamin Blake admitted causing actual harm to his girlfriend Tanya Trevelyn

An amateur rugby prop who beat his girlfriend so badly she blacked out had raised money for a domestic violence charity just days before his court case.

Benjamin Blake, 20, allegedly tried to strangle Tanya Trevelyn, 40, and after admitting at Exeter Crown Court that he caused her so much pain she blacked out, a custodial sentence has been ‘demanded’ by the judge.

The six-foot prop appeared in court just days after he played in a head-to-head charity match between police officers and fire fighters at the Tiverton Rugby Club, Devon where he signed up last month.

The game was raising funds for Stop Abuse for Everyone, a charity dedicated to the fight against domestic violence.

Recorder Brian Lett, QC, told Blake of Tiverton, Devon that even the parts of the assault which he had admitted to were so serious that an immediate jail sentence was inevitable.

Blake admitted causing actual harm, common assault and criminal damage.

Mr Lett said there was also a danger that pressure may be put on the victim, who is now due to give evidence, at a special hearing later this month.

He said: ‘On the facts admitted a custodial sentence is demanded.’

Blake has been remanded in custody pending a hearing.

David Bowen, prosecuting, said all the allegations arose from the same incident in which there was a prolonged and sustained assault.

He said: ‘There is a list of injuries 
and there were 17 different elements of the assault including biting 
of the cheek and two instances of strangulation.

‘The most serious is an allegation which he denies of pulling her legs apart and kicking her between the legs. 

‘We say the cumulative effect is to increase the gravity of the offence.’

Warren Robinson, defending, said Blake disputes aiming a deliberate kick to the groin and trying to strangle his partner, but accepts his assault caused her to lose consciousness. 

Nearly one million women experience at least one incident of domestic abuse each year according to the 2009/10 British Crime Survey.
