By her own admission Emma Watson has always been attracted to unassuming types. Hollywood stars who have asked her out have been dismissed in her withering estimation as ‘difficult and really superficial’. Much like her Harry Potter alter ego, the imperious Hermione Granger, she seems to have little time for conceit.

So there may be some surprise at her current suitor — Matt Janney, a hunky 21-year-old star of Oxford University’s rugby team, who has a  reputation as something of a Lothario.

Pictured in the Mail this week naked in a bath clutching a Varsity trophy, he seems an unlikely match for the elegant and refined Miss Watson, who has previously been open about her desire for a quiet life away from the hubbub of the red carpet.

The couple are holidaying at a five-star resort in the Caribbean, and have been very affectionate with each other as they relax on the beach. So how has Matt won Emma over?

‘Once you know his back story their relationship makes a lot more sense,’ a friend of Emma’s told me this week. ‘Matt’s not the least bit fazed by her celebrity because that world’s pretty normal for him.

‘The fact is he’s come through so much in his life already. His head won’t be turned by a famous face, whether it’s Emma’s or anyone else’s for that matter.

‘He’s seriously clever, extremely self-assured and has no desire to work in showbusiness himself. For the first time in her life, Emma’s found a guy who ticks all the boxes. He may be the one.’

In which case, he will be unlike all his predecessors. At 23, Emma has ended every relationship to date because of the demands of combining her studies with a highly successful acting career. She has studied  at both Oxford and Brown University in the U.S..

Her most recent boyfriend, an American student called William Adamowicz who she also met at Oxford, was discreetly dropped at the end of the summer. Like another old flame, financier Jay Barrymore, he failed to hold her attention.

Her more exciting boyfriends, actors Johnny Simmons and Rafael Cebrian, and rock singer George Craig, were found lacking in intellectual rigour.

Quite a quandary, yet one which Matt seems to have resolved. He and Emma got together last October after she watched him star for Oxford’s rugby team in a game against the Russian national side.

The pair were introduced at a function after the match and hit it off. Since then he has been spending much of his time at Emma’s house, just outside Oxford, and took her as his date to the party following his team’s victory in the Varsity match against Cambridge.

As one fellow student puts it: ‘To take her as his date means he is  serious about her, as you wouldn’t normally take someone who is just a friend to such an event.’

Not only is Matt a dashing sportsman, he is widely admired as one of the best-looking men at Oxford. He is fluent in three languages (he is reading French and Russian at Oriel college). And he keeps famous company.

The Mail has learned that Matt’s sister, Jemima, 23, is in a long-term relationship with Ben Lovett, one of the founders of rock band Mumford & Sons. The band’s lead singer,  Marcus Mumford, is married to actress Carey Mulligan.

Jemima and Ben, who live together in New York, are close friends with both Carey and Keira Knightley.

It is a group in which the gifted Emma would obviously move with ease. There is one obstacle: Matt’s reputation as a ladykiller.

According to the Twitter musings of one of his Oxford rugby pals, an  Australian named Karl Outen, he has a reputation of ‘getting to know’ female students.

Mr Outen tweeted Matt in April 2012, and said: ‘Rumours flying round the nest’ that you ‘got to know a fellow student’ last night. He then posted the rather ungentlemanly tagline ‘another notch on the bedpost’.

Emma’s fans have rallied in response, deluging Matt with Twitter messages warning him not to break her heart.

Yet, contrary to prurient locker- room gossip, friends maintain young Matthew is anything but a cad.They say, his ebullient demeanour belies what has been an incredibly challenging childhood.

‘Matt’s a remarkable guy all right, but I’d never describe him as a “notch on the bedpost” kind of person,’ says Mike Somerville, a friend from his teenage years living in Barnes, South-West London.

‘He was always more interested in his rugby than women. Not to say he wasn’t popular with the girls, it’s  just that he didn’t have that kind  of attitude.

‘He hasn’t been dealt the easiest hand in life, but you wouldn’t know it if you met him. He’s the kind of bloke who makes his success look more straightforward than it has been. But he’s definitely not the type to sleep around. I’ve never heard anyone talk about him that way. He’s been through so much, there’s no way he would be so superficial.’

To describe Matt’s life story as heartbreaking would not be an exaggeration. In fact, it is the stuff of tragic novels.

Raised in the leafy London borough of Richmond with his sister, known to the family as Mima, two years his senior, his father David died at the age of 42 from leukaemia in 1995 when Matt was still a toddler.

Their mother, Jill, a senior lawyer at City law firm Freshfields, raised them alone. Inspired by her experiences, she wrote a successful children’s book aimed at helping parents to explain bereavement to their children which is still in print today.

Somehow she managed to combine a highly successful career (she became a lecturer at the College of Law in London) with motherhood.

Lucy Ellis, a friend since they studied together at Cambridge in the early Eighties, describes her as having a ‘creative and analytical mind’ combined with a ‘natural glamour’.

When the children were in their teens, however, she too was diagnosed with breast cancer. She died in early 2008 when Matt was 16 and before she had even turned 50, just weeks after taking her children for a last holiday in the Caribbean.

Orphaned, Matt moved in with family friends to complete his sixth form at £18,900-a-year King’s College School, Wimbledon, where he excelled both in the classroom and the sport’s field. He was made the school’s  captain in his final year.

On leaving school he moved in  with his sister to a Shepherd’s Bush  terrace house. Yet the siblings — who are extremely close — have since enjoyed lives which are anything  but ordinary.

Matt made a seamless transition to Oxford, via internships with an investment bank and Freshfields,  following a stint coaching youth rugby in Argentina.

He spent last year in Russia,  studying in the city of Yaroslavl, where he played fly half for the semi-professional rugby side.

His sister, meanwhile, has had a meteoric rise as a fashion designer. She studied medicine, but dropped out to pursue her interest in design.

A spokesman for Miss Watson said: 'We do not comment on speculation regarding our clients' private lives'

She designed costumes for  Keira Knightley in the Kenneth  Branagh-directed thriller Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, due for release later this year.

In the background, throughout, was Jemima’s relationship with Ben Lovett. A fellow King’s College  alumnus, Ben, 27, has been touring the globe for the past five years with Mumford & Sons.

Through him, Jemima and Matt have got to know a wide circle of stars. Last year, Jemima set up home in Brooklyn with Ben, where she has launched her own fashion brand and Matt enjoys guest-list status at Mumford gigs.

Having already endured such loss in his life, the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle has obviously failed to seduce him. His principal outlet is sport. At Oxford he enjoys a certain exclusive status which comes with being a rugby blue.

‘They are seen as elite sportsmen who attract good-looking girls,’ says a contemporary who knows the couple. ‘Emma and Matt move in the same circles, but they are a very private couple. They spend a lot of time after the rugby matches at the bar in the Pavilion.’

How different a scenario from last year, when rumours were rife that she would soon be engaged to American heir Will Adamowicz, also 23. But she quietly dumped him after he became embroiled in a drugs scandal.

Pictures uploaded to a friend’s Facebook page show him at a New Year’s Eve party in front of six white scrunched-up paper packets on a table bearing the distinct traces of  white powder. He denied the packages contained drugs, saying it was scraps of paper and flour from a loaf at a dinner they had just finished.

A spokesman for Miss Watson said: ‘We do not comment on speculation regarding our clients’ private lives.’

Now the girl for whom fame proved so trying seems content with her dashing rugby star whose challenges have been greater than her own. Perhaps in each other they have finally found the perfect match.
