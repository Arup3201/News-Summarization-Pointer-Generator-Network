The unofficial spokesman for the Heart Attack Grill restaurant in Las Vegas - which prides itself on 'taste worth dying for' - has died of a heart attack at the age of 52.

John Alleman visited the infamous restaurant, which holds the Guinness world record for the 'most calorific burger', on a daily basis and would often stand outside encouraging other people to enter.

He suffered a heart attack last week and was rushed to Sunrise Hospital, where he remained until doctors removed his life support on Monday.

Passed: John Alleman, the unofficial spokesman for the Heart Attack Grill in Las Vegas, has died from a heart attack. He was such a fan of the eatery that they made him a caricature, Patient John, right

The owner of the hospital-themed restaurant, 'Doctor Jon' Basso told the Las Vegas Sun: 'I told him if you keep eating like 
this, it's going to kill ya.

'He'd say, "I just love your place, Jon." He's the only person I know who was 
probably at the restaurant more than I.'

Alleman was such a valued member of the Heart Attack Grill Community that he was given his own caricature - 'Patient John' - that featured on merchandise for the restaurant.

The caricature also appeared on the front of the menu, along with other hospital-themed characters representing staff.

Heart-stopping: The menu includes a Quadruple Bypass Burger and Flatliner Fries, which are cooked in lard

Danger: The owner said he discourages people from visiting the restaurant more than once a month

'For the past 18 months if you happen to 
walk by the Heart Attack Grill you were probably approached by our new 
spokesman John Alleman,' the restaurant wrote on its Facebook page.

'John truly loved HAG and would spend hours 
every day getting the word out to anyone who would listen.'

Alleman lived with his only relative, his brother, Paul, and had never married nor had children. He worked night shifts as a security guard at a high-rise construction site on the Vegas Strip.

The restaurant added: 'John was a fun spirited man who valued laughter above all else,' the restaurant wrote on its Facebook page. 'He was loved deeply and will be missed.'

Beloved: Alleman was remembered on the restaurant's Facebook page as 'a fun-spirited man who will be missed'

Well known: His image appears on clothing and merchandise for the hospital-themed restaurant

The Heart Attack Grill menu consists of four burgers: the Single Bypass Burger, the Double Bypass Burger, the Triple Bypass Burger, and the Quadruple Bypass Burger - based on the number of patties.

The burgers are not drained of cooking fat, and come with five slices of bacon per patty. All burgers are served with a slice of American cheese, red onion and sliced tomato per patty.

The only side item is Flatliner Fries, which are deep fried in pure lard.

It also sells Butter-fat Shakes made from butter fat cream and made in vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavours. The Grill also sells packaged candies, including candy cigarettes.

To quench your thirst, there are sodas with high sugar content, malt liquor, beers, wines and liquor shots served in four ounce syringes.

Alleman is the second Heart Attack Grill spokesman to die; in March 2011, 29-year-old Blair River passed away.

At the time, Basso said River had succumbed to flu-related pneumonia.

The following year, a customer 
suffered a heart attack while eating a triple bypass burger in the 
restaurant, and two months later, a customer collapsed while eating a 
double bypass burger.

Speaking
to Eater Vegas last year, Basso said his business was 'absolutely 
honest' and said he warned people against going to the restaurant more 
than once a month.

'I say it right in the door, "Caution this establishment is bad for your health",' he said.

The Heart Attack Grill's menu 
includes 'Flatliner Fries' which are cooked in lard, and a Quadruple 
Bypass Burger, which weighs more than three pounds and contains 9,982 calories.

The
restaurant is hospital themed and customers are referred to as 
'patients', orders are called 'prescriptions' and the waitresses are 
'nurses'.

Customers
weighing more than 350 pounds are invited to unlimited free food 
provided they weigh themselves on an electronic platform in front of 
other diners.
