Ambra Battilana, the Italian model who has accused Harvey Weinstein of groping her has told friends she is 'not afraid' of the movie producer despite his fearsome reputation

Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, (left) has accused Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein, 63, (pictured right leaving his home on Tuesday) of touching her breasts and thigh in Manhattan on Friday evening 

The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with the father-of-five who has produced hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York

'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out.

'She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.'

Weinstein is alleged to have asked Battilana if her breasts were real before he groped her chest and asked for a kiss.

The distraught model allegedly asked him to stop and then promptly left.

Surveillance footage from outside the Tribeca office is being analyzed, according to police sources.

Weinstein was reportedly interviewed by the NYPD Special Victims Squad on Saturday after going to the police precinct voluntarily.

Italian newspapers in 2012 reported that Ambra Battilana (pictured) had made a rape complaint against a 70-year-old car dealer ex-boyfriend when she was under 18. The case was dismissed after she never showed up to talk to prosecutors about the allegations 

No charges have been filed and he has promised full cooperation with the probe. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said.

Weinstein's camp have dismissed Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past citing her involvement in Silvio Berlusconi's 'bunga-bunga' orgies in 2010 and reports in the Italian press that she had previously alleged to police that her 70-year-old boyfriend had raped her.

Ambra Battilana's police statement, made in the Alba region of Italy in December 2010, was published in an Italian newspaper, where she said she was 'forced against my will' into having sex with the 'businessman of substantial means' for money when she was under 18.

Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal although it is likely it would have been carried out.

In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable verify her claims.

Miss Battilana met the wealthy, car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports.

The age of sexual consent is 14 in Italy but it is illegal to pay for sex or to have sex with a prostitute who is under the age of 18.

The Italian newspaper, Il Giornale, quoted from her 2010 police statement, where she recalled meeting the businessman at an organized dinner.

The statement read: 'He invited me to ride in his car. Upset by the invitation because of my inexperience and very young age, he induced me to accept out of politeness.

Sources close to Harvey Weinstein told The New York Post's Page Six on Monday that the 22-year-old model's allegations were an attempt at 'blackmail'

'To my enormous embarrassment he began to ask me questions about my sexual preferences and to tell me about his erotic fantasies.

'Then as he started to caress my hand and left leg, he proposed that I become his 'playmate' and before I could oppose he gave me a bag with €2,000. He assured me that it was only an advance of the €5,000 he would give me every month.'

She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.

'From that time on he began to demand sexual relations in compensation for the cash which happened once a week. I did not have the strength to get out of the vicious circle.'

According to reports in Il Giornale, Miss Battilana's statement continued that a few days later 'the businessman took me to an apartment in his possession... under his domination, I went in'.

She told the police that the businessman began 'to violate my every wish'.

Afterwards, she received €2,000. Ten days later, the same thing happened and she received another €2,000 and the relationship continued in this manner.

She said: 'With the money received I helped my mother and bought designer clothes, bags, shoes, furs, jewelry and more.'

The former beauty queen has an international modeling career, shooting editorial campaigns in Europe and the U.S. for designers and magazines 

Battilana allegedly previously witnessed a 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian premier Berlusconi (pictured) and offered testimony to Italian authorities

At Christmas, the 70-year-old spent €5000 on her at a large clothing store.

'I continued to feel uncomfortable about the situation', she said. But she got an apartment in the city center in which everything was paid for with the businessman's money, Il Giornale claimed.

She said in her statement that she suffered the 'commodification of my person' and became 'aware of being used by a man who treated me like a prostitute'.

The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant.

Il Giornale newspaper is owned by the Berlusconi family.

Miss Battilana gave statements to Italian authorities about disgraced Italian prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi's 'bunga-bunga' orgies in 2010 to which she was invited as a Miss Italia contestant and aspiring model.

Ambra's lawyer Patrizia Bugnano, a senator, started proceedings against Berlusconi in October last year for defamation after the ex-politician said that she 'brainwashed' or 'manipulated' the two girls.

Miss Battilana also said never had sex for money during a 2012 court trial involving Berlusconi's sex parties.

She has sued for damages over her image but it is unclear whether she has been awarded a financial sum.

Of their relationship, Mr Cassano said: 'We were together for a year, breaking up at the end of Berlusconi's trial when she was claiming to receive a big amount of money as compensation.

'At that time I was hoping that she was able to change but I'm glad we broke up.'
