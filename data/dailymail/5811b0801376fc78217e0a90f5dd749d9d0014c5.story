They are meant to celebrate Britain's most famous characters in history.

But among the instantly-recognisable faces of Royal Mail's 'Great Britons' stamp set is one that may leave you a little lost.

John Archer, former Mayor or Battersea, is one of the characters featured in the set - a choice which is likely to leave some stamp collectors a little confused.

Pioneer: John Archer, Mayor of Battersea, was the first person of African-Caribbean descent to hold civic office in London

For while his achievements heading up a London borough are indeed admirable, they are not quite as well-known as those of his fellow countrymen.

The set of 10 first class stamps, released today,Â  also includes David Lloyd George, Benjamin Britten and Vivien Leigh.

Royal Mail said it aimed to include people in sport, journalism, music, politics and the arts whose anniversaries of birth fall in 2013.

A spokesman said that the unconventional choice of Mr Archer recognised the contribution he made to public life as 'the first person of African-Caribbean descent to hold civic office in London'.

First class Britons: Others featured on the stamps are photographer Norman Parkinson, actress Vivien Leigh, actor Peter Cushing, David Lloyd George, writer Elizabeth David, composer and pianist Benjamin Britten, archeologist Mary Leakey, footballer Bill Shankly and broadcaster Richard Dimbleby

Inspiration: John Archer was elected into Battersea Borough Council in 1906

Also part of the set are actress Vivien Leigh, famous for her leading roles in Gone with the Wind, and actor Peter Cushing.

From the world of sport, Scottish footballer and manager William 'Bill' Shankly features for his triumph as First Division champions in 1964, 1966 and 1973.

Notable figures from the world of politics are also featured with the first and only Welsh Prime Minister, David Lloyd George.

One of the UK's best loved classical composers Benjamin Britten is included in the ten, with celebrated portrait and fashion photographer Norman Parkinson bolstering the arts contingent.

There is also Richard Dimbleby, the well known journalist, and cookery writer Elizabeth David, who was credited with introducing post-war Britain to 'exotic' Mediterranean cooking.

Completing the ten is eminent archaeologist and anthropologist, Mary Leakey, who was credited with forcing scientists to re-think their long held views on human evolution thanks to her significant discoveries.

Andrew Hammond, Royal Mail Stamps spokesperson, said: 'We are delighted to be honouring some of the UK's most distinguished figures in history through our latest special stamp collection.

'We hope the stamps will serve as a lasting tribute to their memory and once again encourage people to remember their significant contribution to our Great British way of life.'
