Up to 80 Russian troops were killed in a skirmish in Ukraine last month despite Vladimir Putin's claims that Russia is not fighting there, according to documents released by an opposition politician.

Members of an elite Russian paratroop force spoke of the brutal battle near Luhansk, a city in eastern Ukraine, in telephone transcripts leaked to the politician and newspaper publisher Lev Shlosberg.

One paratrooper says: 'We're f***ing walking along looking for these f***ing Ukrainians.

Vladimir Putin claims that his troops are not fighting in Ukraine but a leaked phone conversation between two Russian paratroopers suggests a skirmish into the country took place last month

'We get out into the open and are seen, kapow! 

'We dashed out onto the road, there was a field, sunflowers, and a checkpoint. They started to bomb it — bam bam bam — and they destroyed it,' the New York post reports.

The paratrooper, who was wounded in the attack, claimed that 80 men were killed in the battle and that only ten made it out alive.

He was telling the traumatic story to a fellow soldier in a phone call from a hospital where he was being treated. 

When his comrade asks him if he was aware that he was marching off to battle before the skirmish, he says that he had already told his wife he was 'off to war'.

But he added: 'They don't tell us anything. They say we are off on an exercise.'

The conversation was said to have taken place between members of the elite 76th Guards Air Assault Division, which is based in the city of Pskov.

Ukrainian officials reported a skirmish with the 76th Guards in mid-August and the country's Defense Ministry said on its website that its troops destroyed three of the unit's tanks and seized two troop carriers. 

Russia has denied that the battle took place.

But despite the denials, last month President Vladimir Putin bestowed one of Russia's highest awards, the Order of Suvorov, on the division.

He cited 76th Guards Air Assault Division's 'successful completion of military missions' and 'courage and heroism' - words that would suggest Russian troops have seen military action.
