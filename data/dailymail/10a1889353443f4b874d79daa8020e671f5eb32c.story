Abbi Kinsella, 54, dressed in her witch costume, before she stole tens of thousands from her mother

For a woman convicted of swindling her own elderly mother out her £100,000 life savings, it is a somewhat appropriate outfit.

Posing as a wicked witch, Abbi Kinsella is pictured ahead of a fancy dress party in the snap uploaded to Facebook two years ago.

Kinsella now faces jail after a jury took just 20 minutes to convict her of stealing the cash from her 88-year-old mother, Margaret Bowyer, who suffers from dementia.

The court heard the pensioner ended up ‘on the street and penniless’ after Kinsella, 54, used £34,000 of the money to feed her online bingo habit and had also holidayed in the exclusive resort of St Tropez in the South of France.

Kinsella, whose home has a sign outside featuring a black plastic crow above the warning: ‘Beware of the witch’, also used £200 of her mother’s money on a Sky TV subscription, the court heard.

Prosecutor Andrew Wallace said Mrs Bowyer moved in to a rented home next door to her duplicitous daughter in Tamworth Staffordshire, after selling her own property in Swadlincote, Derbyshire, and banking the money from the sale.

But over the next three years, more than £61,000 was transferred from Mrs Bowyer’s bank account to Kinsella’s, and in addition there were 244 cash withdrawals totalling more than £38,000.

After plundering the account, Kinsella cancelled her mother’s rent and direct debit payments in April 2011.

As a result, the pensioner, who was too ill to give evidence, was eventually evicted from her rented home in November 2012, Stafford Crown Court was told.

Mr Wallace said Kinsella had ‘totally abused her position as Mrs Bowyer’s daughter...thrown her mother out on the street, penniless, and then lied about it.

‘She has taken advantage of an old lady. While she was supposed to be looking after her mother...she’s been funding her bingo habit. She has fleeced her mother.’

Social services referred Mrs Bowyer’s case to the police in November 2012 and her daughter was arrested a month later.

When questioned, Kinsella said she had stopped rent payments going out of the account in April 2011 because the owner of the property owed them some money for ‘doing the back garden’.

She said she had restarted rent payments in cash, but hadn’t got any receipts for it.

Kinsella, a one-time Avon lady now said by neighbours to work at Birmingham Airport, claimed she had given the money transferred back to Mrs Bowyer ‘in cash’.

She denied using the money for her own gain, but when asked if she knew what her mother had done with £212 a week, Kinsella said ‘No’.

The prosecutor at Kinsella's trial argued how she had 'abused' her position and had 'thrown her mother out on the street'

Kinsella denied four charges of theft from her mother, who was too ill to give evidence, but admitted one offence of fraud.

Following the jury’s verdict on Monday, Judge Mark Eades told her: ‘I don’t want you to be under any illusions, you should prepare yourself for a custodial sentence.’

Kinsella was remanded on bail and will be sentenced after a pre-sentence report has been prepared.

Detective Constable Mark Woodings, the officer who carried out the investigation for Staffordshire Police, said: ‘The victim is an extremely vulnerable elderly lady.

‘When she became unable to manage her own financial affairs due to the onset of dementia, the family entrusted Kinsella to look after her interests and welfare.

‘Kinsella went on to abuse that trust in a most heartless and callous way, stealing every penny of her mother’s life savings.

‘She systematically and repeatedly helped herself to more than £100,000 in order to feed a gambling habit and to live a life beyond her means.

‘Her actions have left a proud lady homeless, penniless and in debt for the first time in her life.’ Mrs Bowyer is now thought to be living in a care home in Tamworth.’

There was no sign of divorced Kinsella at the modern three-bedroom terrace she shares with partner John Causer, 53, a building worker, in Tamworth.

Neighbours said the couple regularly held fancy dress parties and said Kinsella had been known to dress up as a witch.

It is an image she appears to revel in -a sign outside her house features a black plastic crow above the warning: ‘Beware of the witch’.
