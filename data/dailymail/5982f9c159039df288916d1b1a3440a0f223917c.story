Alan Stubbs has lambasted Willie Collum over the referee’s role in the goal that sealed a 2-0 win for Rangers at Easter Road.

The Hibernian boss was astonished that Collum didn’t award a free-kick after Lee Wallace appeared to foul Paul Hanlon as the centre-half sought to clear.

Kenny Miller seized the loose ball and, with the home defence still appealing for an infringement, cracked home an 80th-minute shot that added to Wallace’s opener.

Stubbs attempted to pick his words carefully afterwards but couldn’t disguise his anger towards Collum, who has been at the centre of numerous controversies this season.

‘Can I say no comment in case I get into any trouble?’ Stubbs opened.

‘I’ve been in management a short time. I was a player a long time. Over the years, that decision would be given 100 per cent of the time.

‘I think that’s probably the best way to describe it without me getting into trouble.

‘Not 90 per cent, not 99 per cent, 100 per cent. But a guy who has an influence over a game decided differently.

‘When he sees it back again... well, there’s no point. He’s there to get the big calls right and he got a big call very, very wrong.

‘There was no point speaking to him afterwards. Everyone in the stadium could see it was a foul.

‘I don’t want to sit here and try to justify a decision. Only one guy can do that, but he’s protected and not allowed to talk. It spoiled the game, although obviously not from Rangers’ point of view.’

Hanlon was booked for his protests towards Collum as Rangers celebrated Miller’ s first goal since December.

‘Most of the stadium felt it was a foul,’ said the defender. ‘I thought it was but the referee thought differently.

‘I read the pass, got in front of Wallace and went to clear with my right foot. I just felt like I was taken out.

‘It’s disappointing a decision like that has maybe ruined our chances of getting anything from the game.

‘I wasn’t given an explanation, he (Collum) just decided to book me for dissent even though I didn’t say much.

‘I just said it was a foul, along with everyone else who surrounded him.

‘I didn’t even think I was in his face but I think he just has to pick a player and book him.’
