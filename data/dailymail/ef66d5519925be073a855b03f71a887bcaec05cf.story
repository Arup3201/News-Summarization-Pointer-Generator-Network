Two male nurses were caught on camera performing sexual acts on and beside a 98-year-old stroke victim.

The in-home nurses, Russel Torralba and Alfredo Ruiz, masturbated and fondled each other at the foot of the woman's bed in San Diego and are now being investigated for their shocking behavior, XETV reports.

In one instance one of the men performed an explicit act on the woman’s body.

Fellow nurse Russel Torralba has also been charged with neglect by a caregiver and a lewd act by a caregiver but he remains at large

The woman is unable to speak or communicate with her hands after suffering a stroke and right-side paralysis in 2005, but is fully aware of her surroundings, the family’s attorney, William Berman, says.

'I myself couldn't believe it,' Berman told XETV. He said it was the most shocking case of elder abuse he has seen in 15 years of practice in that specialty

The home-shot footage is from March 3 and March 11, 2011.

Family members have additionally discovered instances of sexually inappropriate acts on five occasions dating back to February 27, according to public records.

The family had been paying Torralba and Ruiz $55 an hour, over $1,300 a day, for their services.

In court: Alfredo Ruiz, 42, is alleged to be one of the nurses in the video footage and has been held on $200,000 bail

The current suspension on the two men bars them from working for home health agencies, but allows them to work in hospitals.

A hearing on the permanent suspension of their licenses is scheduled for November 14.

The state Department of Consumer Affairs launched an investigation last year into AMS Home Care Solutions, the agency the men worked for.

'We are working to shut them down,' Russ Heimerich, a spokesman for the department told the San-Diego Union-Tribune.

The San Diego District Attorney's office is reviewing the case for possible criminal prosecution.

The case against the two men has been adjourned by a San Diego court until January
