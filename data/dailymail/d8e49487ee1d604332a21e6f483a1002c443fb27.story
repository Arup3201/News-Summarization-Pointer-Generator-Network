Barclays was yesterday mocked by furious shareholders for dishing out ‘Manchester United’-style bonuses for ‘Colchester United’ performance.

In a bruising showdown at its annual general meeting, investors protested against the lavish pay and perks awarded by the High Street giant despite a 32 per cent slump in profits.

More than a third of votes rejected or failed to back the bank’s remuneration report, which sanctioned a 10 per cent increase in bonuses to £2.38billion.

And outside the meeting, held at London’s Royal Festival Hall, activists condemned the bank for helping large companies in Africa use tax havens to funnel money out of the country – allegations that Barclays denies.

Investors, who received £859million in dividends last year, yesterday lined up to criticise the board for rewarding failure after repeatedly promising to curb the bank’s high-rolling pay culture.

Shareholder Phil Clarke compared Barclays’ performance with that of Colchester United, which is fighting to avoid relegation from League One.

He said: ‘I’m not a banker basher, I’m no anti-capitalist. But I do believe in paying for a good outcome. We’re paying for Manchester United but we’re getting Colchester United.’

Last year, 481 Barclays staff were paid £1million or more, up from 428 in 2012, while investment bankers received average bonuses of £60,100.

Investor Edward O’Toole complained that Barclays’ culture has ‘transformed from one of prudence to management greed’.

Last year, 481 staff were paid at least £1million, up from 428 in 2012. Bonuses averaged at £60,100

The pay protest was led by insurer Standard Life, which owns almost 2 per cent of Barclays.

Director Alison Kennedy told the Barclays board: ‘We are unconvinced the 2013 bonus pool was in the best interests of shareholders.’ She added that the pay row has had ‘negative repercussions on the bank’s reputation’.

Sir John Sunderland, chairman of Barclays’ remuneration committee, was heckled by the meeting  after asking Miss Kennedy not to complain publicly.

The protest is an embarrassing blow for 
the bosses at Barclays who promised to end the high-pay  culture and 
clean up its act after a raft of scandals, including a £290million fine 
for rigging the Libor interest rate which influences the cost of loans 
and mortgages.

Controversy: The setback will come as an embarrassment for chief executive Anthony Jenkins

Last night Barclays also received a sharp rebuke from the Institute of Directors over the request to Miss Kennedy.

Dr Roger Barker, of the IoD, said: ‘Shareholders own the company and it is right they have their say on how it is governed.

‘Shareholder engagement at public meetings should be encouraged, not criticised.’

Addressing the AGM, Sir John claimed the bank had taken the ‘difficult option’ by increasing payouts for staff.

He said: ‘Do you think I and the board seek the level of invective that has come upon us? The easy option would have been to make a non-controversial decision around the bonus pool. But we would have seen a significant further exodus from the investment bank.’

Barclays chairman Sir David Walker also defended the pay rise, arguing it was necessary to stop investment bankers being poached by rivals.

He even added that the bank had ‘cut them [bonuses] too far’ over the Libor-rigging scandal in 2012, which had contributed to double the usual number of investment bankers leaving last year.

He said the bonus pool was ‘distorted’ because it docked £816million from payouts in 2012 to penalise staff for its £290million fine for rigging Libor interest rates.

Without these penalties, he said, the bonus pool would have fallen by 18 per cent in 2013.

But shareholder Michael Mason said: ‘Not a single banker has gone to jail. In Barclays you fixed the Libor rate – which affects millions of people. But you still get huge bonuses. How many people were paid bonuses for committing criminal and illegal acts?’
