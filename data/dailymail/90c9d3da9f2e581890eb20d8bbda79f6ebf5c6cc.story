Council bosses have been slammed for spending more than £4,000 on a two-day 'workshop' at an historic castle.

A group of 26 senior Conservative councillors and officers from Surrey County Council attended the away day at the 900-year-old Farnham Castle.

Opposition politicians and local residents accused them of wasting taxpayer's money on a 'posh jolly'.

The 12th century castle, which boasts 32 bedrooms and is set in five acres of historic gardens, was built by the grandson of William the Conqueror and was the home of the Bishops of WInchester.

Up to 650 people face losing their jobs at Surrey Country Council as the auhtority struggles to save £200m over the next four years due to government funding cuts.

Lib Dem councillor John Orrick said: 'It's quite staggering when you look at the situation when they're about to put up council tax.

Chief Executive of Surrey County Council David McNulty defended the trip saying it was 'value for money'

'There are any number of areas £4,000 could have been better spent. It just seems remarkably ill-conceived and short-sighted.

'It's not their money - they haven't had to earn it. We have a duty to provide excellent services and value, and to not do so is almost a dereliction of duty.'

Chief executive of Surrey County Council, David McNulty, said the workshop, which took place on November 5 and 6, allowed the organisation to 'develop our approach on complex issues'.

He said: 'I was at the workshop. I am
satisfied that it was the least expensive way of delivering the type of
workshop that was required.

'Intensive workshops with a very 
focused agenda are a recognised way of enabling organisations to develop
their approach on complex issues.

'The scale of the challenges facing 
us make it more important than ever that time is invested in ensuring we
have the most effective approach to delivering our growing 
responsibilities.

'The ideas that came out of this very
intensive workshop are already delivering savings and benefits to 
residents that go way beyond the cost of the workshop itself.

'I believe that councillors and staff
at Surrey County Council are continually focused on value for money, 
which is why we have made such strong efficiency savings over recent 
years.'

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles recently published a paper called '50 Ways to save: Examples of Sensible Savings in Local Government', which puts at number 20 'Cancel away days at posh hotels'.

It says: 'Use a council-owned property to hold any away day. Or borrow a room from a neighbouring council at no cost, and offer a free room to them for their away day.'

Local resident Greg Tiller, 43, said: 'They've just thrown away £4,000 on a posh jolly at a nice old castle.'

The accounts worker, of Epsom, Surrey, added: 'I wish I could afford to go away for a couple of days without paying for anything, but unfortunately I have to work for a living.'
