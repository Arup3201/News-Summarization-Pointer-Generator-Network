The 32-year-old doctor shared the exciting news on her father's company website, as well as via her Twitter account.

Writing on Virgin.com, she explained that she wouldn't be taking part in the Virgin Strive Challenge, a 1,000km journey from London to the Matterhorn with marathons, rowing, cycling, hiking and climbing, with her family because of her pregnancy.

Happy news: Holly Branson told fans via Twitter today that she and husband Freddie are delighted to be expecting twins

In a blog post entitled 'Why I’m supporting, not joining, the Virgin Strive Challenge', she wrote: 'There are just days to go before the Virgin STRIVE Challenge begins and the whole team is getting very excited - and a little bit nervous!

'The epic journey from London to the Matterhorn starts with a marathon from the O2 Arena to Gravesend on August 7th. The core team of 10 people will be striving to reach the summit of the Matterhorn entirely under their own steam, with marathons, rowing, cycling, hiking and climbing all to come on a route of more than 1,000km.

'My brother Sam, cousin Noah and the team have been training and fundraising hard, and having a lot of fun along the way. As well as an adventure of a lifetime, the Virgin STRIVE Challenge is aiming to raise £750,000 to support young people in the UK to develop the life skills they need to reach their potential.

'Life skills is this year’s main focus for Big Change, and it is great to see the money raised by the Virgin STRIVE Challenge going towards such important and innovative projects to help young people thrive in life.

'As one of Big Change’s Trustees, some of you have been asking why I’m now not taking part in the Virgin STRIVE Challenge myself.

'Well, Freddie and I are delighted to share the happy news that we are expecting twins!'.

She continued: 'After telling our families and all of the Virgin family too, we thought it was time to let everyone know - plus I don’t want anybody thinking I wasn’t up for the challenge of doing Strive!!

'Thanks to everybody for their well-wishes and support so far.'

Holly and her husband Freddie Andrewes, who met at school in Oxford, tied the knot in January 2012 in front of their proud and happy friends and 
family on her father Sir Richard Branson's 
idyllic Necker Island.

Holly and Freddie married on the island 
that back in August was ravaged by a huge fire that destroyed the Great 
House on the Virgin Island.

She
 wasn't going to let that stop her holding her big day there and said 
getting married on the remains added a special aspect to the ceremony.

Talking to Hello! magazine, she said: 'Because it is such a dramatic environment, you don't get a sad feeling 
on the ruins, it's more of an uplifting, wow, a feeling of celebration 
and a time to reflect.

'Before, we were wondering where to fit that many people to have a 
proper service, but it was the most obvious big flat open space, it was 
perfect.

'It's definitely our special place and it looked absolutely beautiful, 
even thought it was still very rustic - there are still piles of rubble -
 it was dramatic. And it's stunning because you're at the top of a hill 
so there are incredible panoramic views.'

Explanation: Writing on Virgin.com, she explained that she wouldn't be taking part in the Virgin Strive Challenge because of her pregnancy.

Clearly the place is 
special; in the tweet announcing her pregnancy news, she and Freddie can
 be seen posing on a hill on Necker Island.

At the time of her wedding, Holly said: 'He was really keen for
 me to be pregnant walking down the aisle. He didn't think we should 
worry about being married first.

'My parents weren't married before they 
had Sam and I, but both had been married before and it didn't work, so I
 think for us, it's nice to do everything in the right order.'

Will she be godmother? Holly, 32, is a close friend of Princess Beatrice, who will no doubt play a pivotal role in the baby's life
