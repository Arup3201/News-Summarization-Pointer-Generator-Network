Cayman Naib, 13, hadn't been seen since he left his home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday

He left his home 30 minutes after getting an email from the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr about late homework

A police source said a K-9 team found Cayman Naib's body in Darby Creek Sunday at 1.30pm

The boy was discovered around 1.30pm by a K-9 search team in Darby Creek, a police source told The Inquirer. 

The body was only a few hundred yards from the 13-acre property where his family's home is located. 

The Delaware County district attorney's office could not say if Cayman's body 'exhibited signs of trauma due to snow',  the Delaware County Daily Times reported. 

The Naibs created the Facebook group 'Find Cayman' to aid the search effort.

They updated the page with a message confirming Cayman's death on Sunday afternoon. 

They wrote: 'It is with a heavy heart that we share news that the family has just learned through the search and rescue team and local law enforcement that Cayman has been found deceased. 

'Please understand that the family is still processing and struggling with this most recent news but that they would like to thank all of the thousands of people over the last five days – friends, family, community, law enforcement, local, county, and federal, search and rescue, fire departments, the school communities, especially Shipley and Episcopal Academy, and even perfect strangers – who have come together to support the family to find Cayman.'

The family has asked for privacy and will not update the Facebook page while the investigation is ongoing.

They have a daughter as well.  

Police were investigating the matter as a runaway case, according to FOX 29. 

Before getting the heartbreaking news, Farid Naib, Cayman's father, called his son 'a great kid'.

He said: 'He was upset over a homework assignment and went out into the storm Wednesday night.'

According to a post on the Facebook page, the search for Cayman on Saturday  included 15 dog teams with their handlers, a group of more than 250 volunteers and the Berwyn Fire Department.

On Sunday morning, Becky and Farid Naib wrote: 'The search continues today.

'We have been overwhelmed by our friend's and our community's support.

'Friends from thousand s of miles away have flown into help with search. 

'We are stunned by the depth of assistance we are being provided. 

'Law enforcement from our local police to the federal level are doing everything they can to help.

'All we need now is a happy ending, 

'Cayman please come home. We love you.'
