Former European hurdles champion Rhys Williams insists he should not have been suspended for having a banned substance in his system due to a contaminated supplement.

Williams and fellow Welshman Gareth Warburton were 'at fault or negligent' in failing to check supplements they took in an energy drink contained banned substances, according to a UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) official report which was published on Monday.

The pair failed drugs tests last summer - forcing the athletes to miss both the Commonwealth Games and the European Championships. Although their bans were reduced as it was accepted they did not knowingly use banned substances, Williams, 30, received a suspension of four months with Warburton, 31, banned for six months.

Both athletes are now clear to compete again after admitting their careers would have been over had the maximum four-year ban for serious cases of intentional doping been handed out, but Williams - who won European 400m hurdles gold at Helsinki in 2012 - still feels he has done nothing wrong and that the punishment was harsh.

'I have to accept what the suspension is but if you ask me I shouldn't have had one,' Williams said.

'They found something in my body that was a nanogram amount of a veterinary substance which stays in your body for nine months, so it was definitely not something a 400-metre hurdler would take to get a performance.

'It's all bizarre and it's impossible to foresee a small amount in a supplement that's got labelling.

'I think I've already served more than enough punishment by missing the Commonwealth Games and the European Championship.

'But I'm relieved now I can compete this season because I thought it could be the end of my athletics career, even though I'd done nothing wrong.'

Cardiff athlete Williams had just given a speech as Wales athletics team captain on the eve of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow when he was told he had tested positive for a banned substance.

The next day he was on the plane home from the team's pre-Games base in Portugal, fighting to save his career and launching a campaign which he says has cost him £100,000 when you add up legal fees and loss of track earnings and sponsorship.

'I've never cried so much in my life and it also left my wife and coach in tears, it's been very upsetting for the whole family,' said Williams, the son of Wales rugby legend JJ.

'I don't think any athlete realises how bad it can be until it happens to you.

'What I don't want is people to associate me with drugs as I've proved where the cross-contamination has come from, but I know some people won't care about the facts.

'Google my name now and the first thing that comes up is doping.

'I've been in the British senior team since 2005 and done a lot of good things but this has ruined my reputation and that's what I am trying to get back.

'I want to turn this whole thing into a positive and educate athletes in not making the same mistake, because if it can happen to me who's done all the physical checks then it can happen to anyone.'

Fellow Welshman Gary Warburton was also banned for six months for inadvertently taking a supplement 

Williams says he is now focused on resuming his track career ahead of this year's World Championships in Beijing but, like Warburton, admits he will not be using supplements in the future.

'UK Anti-Doping have got to be seen to set an example and something was found in my body,' Williams said.

'I can't deny that and I've accepted that, but thankfully I've proved where the cross-contamination has come from.

'My aim now is to get back in that British team, do well at the World Championships and then look at the Olympics in Rio.'

Warburton said his suspension was two months longer than Williams' because he was told he had not made as many checks on the supplement concerned as his international colleague.

The 800m runner from north Wales said he was not bothered about the finger of suspicion being pointed at him and insisted he was a clean athlete.

'Everyone who knows us has been behind us and knows we haven't done anything wrong,' said Warburton, who competed for Great Britain at the London 2012 Olympics.

'It won't affect me. People can say what they want but my shoulders are broad and I'll concentrate on my own career.

'It's been a nightmare six months and it's cost a ridiculous amount of money to clear my name.

'But I would have paid anything to do that because I don't want people thinking I'm a cheat.'

UKAD director of legal Graham Arthur said in a statement: 'These cases send a powerful reminder to athletes that there is no guarantee that any supplement product is free from banned substances.

'Athletes are strongly advised to be very cautious if they choose to use any supplement product and must undertake thorough research of any products before use.

'Information revealed as a result should be further investigated and we advise athletes to keep evidence of their research.

'The principle of strict liability dictates athletes are responsible for any substance found in their body.'
