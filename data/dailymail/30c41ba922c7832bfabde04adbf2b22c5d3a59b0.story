At the International Pole 
Championship in Hong Kong, Australia's Deborah Roach slide and swung past her 
competitors to win first place in the disabled division.Â

'I actually got into an underground Goth scene in my teenage years because I didn't fit into normal society. I loved dancing the night away on the dance floor, and that led to stage dancing in clubs' she said.

In 2006, inspired by a circus-themed double act she saw at a club she was dancing in, Ms Roach took up pole dancing and aerial acrobatics, and hasn't looked back.

After winning a pole dancing competition against able-bodied dancers in 2009, she quit her job in IT, and became a personal trainer.

On her competitor profile page, Ms Roach 
wrote of her unexpected career' As a 
child and teen with low self esteem I believed that aesthetic and 
athletic pursuits were not for me, not for my 'different' body'

She also decided to get her first prosthetic arm and learn to ride a bike at age 28.

On her competitor profile page, Ms Roach wrote of her unexpected career, 'I have always loved dancing but as a child and teen with low self esteem I believed that aesthetic and athletic pursuits were not for me, not for my 'different' body... Luckily as an adult, I learned to challenge my assumptions.'

Once relegated to strip clubs, in recent years pole dancing has developed into a form of keep fit and teachers promote it as a legitimate form of dance and acrobatics.

To receive the maximum amount of 
points, performances need to be well-executed with careful attention 
paid to the synchronization of dance moves to music.

Emphasis is also placed on energy, enthusiasm and strong stage presence.

The
competitor with the highest scores in both fitness and art won the 
title of Ultimate Pole Champion in each of four divisions: men's, 
women's, disabled, and doubles.
