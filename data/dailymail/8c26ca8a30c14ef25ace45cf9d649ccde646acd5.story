More than a thousand people in Iowa and Minnesota have reported seeing a large fireball – believed to have been a meteor – shoot across the night sky on Thursday.

Some of the best footage of the streaking fiery object was captured by a quick thinking state trooper in Missouri who hit record on his dash-cam just in time.

Witnesses have reported seeing an object ‘as bright 
as the sun that fragmented into many parts’ as well as several reports 
of ‘sonic effects associated with the meteor’.

One witness described it as ‘neon green with trail of sparks’, reports CBS News.
