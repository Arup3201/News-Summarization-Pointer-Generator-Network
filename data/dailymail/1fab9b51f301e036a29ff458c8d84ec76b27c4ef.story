A schoolgirl was sent home just hours after starting the new term after teachers insisted her trousers were too tight.

Fourteen-year-old  Annalise Wilks had just rejoined friends after their summer holidays and taken her first steps into preparing for GCSE exams.

But the Year 10 student was pulled to one side by furious staff at Beaumont Leys School, Leicester, and told to change her trousers or go home.

Some 25 children were given their marching orders or put into isolation for breaking the secondary school’s ‘zero tolerance’ uniform rules.

Annalise’s mother, Denise, 44, was contacted by the school on Thursday to be told her daughter was not allowed into her classes.

She  said: 'I personally think Annalise’s trousers were suitable - I don’t think they were too tight at all. I think it’s disgusting. She’s being deprived of an education.

'I know at least two other parents who are furious about it. Can’t they just educate the children until 3pm and then send them home with a letter?'

Head teacher Liz Logie, who has overseen seven years of academic improvement at the school, said the hard line was important for school discipline, and that no children were sent home unless their parents were there waiting for them.

'We’ve changed our school uniform and we anticipated having hiccups, which is why we posted letters to students’ homes with precise descriptions and had two or three assemblies with the pupils,' said Ms Logie.

'We made it really clear they would be put in isolation or sent home if they did not wear the uniform.

'About 20 to 25 out of 1,050 pupils were in the wrong clothes or shoes and, if their parents could be contacted, they were sent home and, if not, they were put in isolation.”

Ms Logie added:  'Schools such as Beaumont Leys in challenging areas don’t get to be successful without being clear and rigorous.'

Beaumont Leys School in Leicester said the hard line was necessary for school discipline. 25 other pupils were sent home on the first day of term yesterday

'We know there were parents who were hacked off with us over the uniform but we don’t imagine they will be so hacked off when their children get good results.'

In the past, pupils in years seven, eight and nine had their own uniform, while older students were asked to wear black and white, with certain restrictions on styles.

The new uniform is designed for students of all year groups. Boys must wear a white shirt, school tie, black trousers and a black blazer, while girls have the same uniform with the option of wearing a knee-length skirt instead of trousers.

Ms Logie said part of the reason for the new uniform was to avoid having ‘ridiculous’ conversations about what the rules were.

The school’s website includes a guide with illustrations of what styles of clothes are acceptable.
