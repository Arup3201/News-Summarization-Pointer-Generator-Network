Tragic: Father-of-two Keith Preece, 62, was killed after being kicked in the head by one of his own cows

A farmer has been killed after being kicked in the head by one of his own cows in a freak accident.

Father-of-two Keith Preece, 62, was loading cattle on to a trailer on his farm in Shropshire with his wife when the half-tonne animal kicked out and stuck him on top of the neck.

Mr Preece was rushed to Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital following the accident in Bridgnorth last Wednesday.

Despite the efforts of doctors Mr Preece died from his injuries in hospital two days later.

Mr Preece, who was described as fit and healthy before the accident, is survived by his wife and daughters, Debbie and Rachel.

Yesterday his heartbroken family spoke about the tragedy for the first time. 

His wife June said in a statement: 'We are all still reeling from the shock of it all.'

'He was a devoted husband and loving father and grandfather.' 

Richard Yates, chairman of the Shropshire branch of the National Farmers Union, paid an emotional tribute to his friend.

He said: 'He always had a smile on his face and was simply one of life's good guys.

'He was a man of the land, a real countryman and worked every day. He was a traditional, hardworking farmer.

'Keith had a great life in front of him to enjoy and never did anyone any harm.

'It shows how unpredictable each day can be and his passing is such a tragedy.'

Mr Preece's family also revealed consultants had likened the accident to the sudden death of cricketer Phil Hughes in November last year.

Hughes, 25, also tragically died two days after being hit on neck by a ball during a domestic match in Sydney.

In both cases the blows had struck the points at the base of the skull causing a vertebral artery - one of the main arteries that leads to the brain - to split and bleed into the brain.

Doctors say there have only been one hundred cases worldwide of the 'extremely rare' condition known as vertebral artery dissection.

An inquest is yet to be opened into Mr Preece's death.
