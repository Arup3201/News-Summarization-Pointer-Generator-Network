A man spotted running naked around bars and restaurants in a city centre is thought to have to plunged to his death down a 50ft hole on a building site.

Officers launched an investigation after a man's naked body was found at the bottom of a lift shaft at the One Smithfield Square site near the Northern Quarter in Manchester yesterday afternoon.

Greater Manchester Police detectives believe he is the same man seen by revellers 'looking lost' and trying to get into Northern Quarter nightspots barefoot and wearing no clothes on Friday night.

He was witnessed in the area by dozens of people at around 8.30pm, with one woman seeing him enter Solita restaurant in what appeared to be a 'confused state' in front of a room full of diners.

She said: ‘He walked in at the back of the restaurant, which was pretty much full at the time and stood there for a short while.

‘When members of staff started to approach him he got scared and went back out of the door.’

Pictured by Twitter users who said he appeared to be lost, the man was then believed to have made his way to the nearby Bluu bar before being turned away by bouncers.

A member of staff said: ‘He'd been seen in the general area around the bar although it wasn't clear where he had come from and he didn't seem to be with anyone.’

Police believe some time after being turned away from the bar, the man managed to get onto the building site around 200 yards away. The man was discovered by a construction worker on the site at around 1.15pm.

He was pronounced dead three hours later after medics gained access to the bottom of the shaft to examine the body. Officers are now trying to identify the man and piece together the circumstances surrounding his death.

A post-mortem is due to take place today - and the site, which is being developed into 77 apartments, is currently sealed off for forensic investigation.

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: ‘At about 1.15pm on Monday police were called to a construction site on Smithfields, off Goadsby Street, to a report that a body had been found.

‘The body of a man was found at the scene and an investigation into the circumstances leading up to his death has begun.

'A post mortem examination will take place later to establish the cause of death. This investigation is at a very early stage and more information will be released when it becomes available.’
