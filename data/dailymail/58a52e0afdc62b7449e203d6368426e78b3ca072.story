Former Manchester United flop Mame Biram Diouf believes he can prove his doubters wrong on his return to the Premier League after joining Stoke City on a four-year deal.

The Senegal international failed to establish himself as a first team regular at Manchester United during his first stint in England - but believes he has matured into a prolific striker since his time away from the Premier League.

‘I am a much better player than the one who left Manchester United, of course I am,' said Diouf.

‘I’m 26 now, not a 21-year-old, and I have got a lot more maturity, a lot more games in my legs and more confidence in myself.

‘I just want to play football have fun and enjoy it, not put pressure on myself. I just try to score as many goals as I can.’

Diouf, who was loaned out to Molde and Blackburn Rovers during his time at Old Trafford, scored 26 goals in 57 Bundesliga games for Hannover before sealing a free transfer to Mark Hughes' Stoke on July 1.

The 26-year-old scored just one goal in nine senior appearances for Manchester United during his three-year stint at the north-west outfit.
