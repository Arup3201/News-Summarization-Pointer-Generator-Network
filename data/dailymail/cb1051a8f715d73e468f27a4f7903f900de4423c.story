The great Easter getaway got off to a nightmare start last night as travel chaos hit one of Britain’s busiest stations.

Thousands of Eurostar passengers were stranded at St Pancras station in London after a man died on a train line in France and a train broke down.

Stations, motorways and airports are likely to remain congested over the break, with more than six  million Britons planning trips.

Eurostar had to cancel 14 trains, leading to pandemonium as queues snaked around the station and  passengers were hit with delays of up to eight hours.

A fatality near Lille in northern France involving a French high-speed train resulted in diversions and delays to Eurostar. Then, just as services were getting back to normal, a Eurotunnel passenger shuttle train broke down in the Channel Tunnel. By 6.45pm, the company announced it was ceasing trains until today.

An announcement on the Eurostar website said: ‘Eurostar services are now closed for the day and regrettably no further passengers are being accepted at our stations. Please do not travel to our stations this evening.’

But passengers, many of whom knew nothing about the cancellations, voiced their anger on social media.

Sarah Martin tweeted: ‘Really disappointed with complete lack of communication about cancellation of trains and options. No contingency plans.’

Pictures posted on social media showed long lines of passengers snaking around the terminal. British Transport Police said officers has been dispatched to assist with crowd control.

A BTP spokesman said last night: ‘A number of officers have been at the station throughout the day assisting with crowd control and supporting rail staff and passengers, and will remain there as long as is required.’

Trains were expected to begin running again as normal this morning, with the first train scheduled to leave St Pancras at 6.18am.

A spokesman for Eurostar said the company had worked hard to ensure that 44 services still ran  yesterday.

He added: ‘Inevitably there will be a backlog, but we will do everything we can to help the passengers affected.’

More than 130,000 passengers were expected to travel on Euro-star over the weekend.

Meanwhile, millions took to the roads last night, with the weekend likely to see as many as 16 million cars on the move. About 3.4 million Britons are set to take an Easter break in the UK involving at least one overnight stay. In addition, 6.5 million Britons are planning day trips over the holiday period.

For those staying at home, today is expected to be the best day of the holiday for weather, with cooler, cloudier and wetter conditions as the weekend goes on.
