Right-to-die campaigner Tony Nicklinson urged his family not to mourn him when he passed away last week – saying he was ‘already dead’.

The locked-in syndrome sufferer’s spirit severely deteriorated after the High Court rejected his request to ‘die with dignity’ with the help of medical professionals, according to his widow.

Speaking for the first time since he died, Jane Nicklinson added that losing the case had left him ‘devastated’ and feeling he ‘couldn’t take it any more’. She said her husband started refusing food, fluids and medication and died of pneumonia six days later.

Mr Nicklinson, 58, had campaigned for the right for doctors to assist his suicide – since his condition meant he could not easily take his own life.

His wife said: ‘It was the day after [the High Court decision] that he said to me that the fight had just gone.

‘He said he couldn’t take it any more. Within a couple of days he developed pneumonia – the last 48 hours were pretty unpleasant but thankfully it was quick. It’s just a shame that he couldn’t die the way he wanted to die.’

Mrs Nicklinson, 56, said the family had known the court judgment a few days before it was officially announced.

It was on Monday last week, after it had been made public, that her husband decided to stop eating and drinking. He also refused antibiotics and died at home in Melksham, Wiltshire, last Wednesday with his wife and daughters Beth, 22, and Lauren, 24, at his side.

Mrs Nicklinson said: ‘I think the moment was the day he broke down in front of all the cameras. I think it really hit him then that everyone else out there was going to know as well. It completely knocked him for six.’ She told BBC Wiltshire how living with locked-in syndrome after a stroke in 2005 had been a ‘living nightmare’ for her husband.

She said the 6ft 4in former rugby player had physically declined in recent months, taking painkillers for the first time and struggling to use the computer through which he communicated with the outside world. 

The former nurse added she did not believe her husband would have wanted to live much longer if the court had ruled in his favour. 

She said: ‘One of the last things he said to me was: “I’m already dead – don’t mourn for me.”’

Judges ruled on August 16 that they did not have the power to grant Mr Nicklinson’s request for a doctor to be given immunity from prosecution for giving him a lethal dose of painkillers. His lawyers had argued that life after his stroke was intolerable.

But Lord Justice Toulson said it was not the place of the courts to ‘usurp the function of Parliament’ by effectively changing the law.

Mr Nicklinson broke down in tears on live TV and responded that MPs were ‘cowards’ and would never change the law. His widow yesterday said she hoped someone else would now take up his campaign.
