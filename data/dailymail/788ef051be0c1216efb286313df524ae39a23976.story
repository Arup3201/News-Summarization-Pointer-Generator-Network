A woman who was abused by her father and went on to have his baby has revealed she is starting to rebuild her life after her attacker was jailed. 

Hollie Davey, 26, from Essex, was abused, molested and raped as a young girl by Paul Davey falling pregnant with his child twice - the first she lost after he carried out a home abortion.

She tracked him down at the age of 13 after being raised by an adoptive family. Speaking for the first time about her ordeal since her father was jailed, Miss Davey said she will 'never get over' what he did to her after he stole her childhood away from her.

Miss Davey, who has since had three daughters, Alayla, six, Roxanne, four and Amelia, two, revealed the son she gave birth to after her father raped her was taken into care.

Her harrowing experience started at the age of 13 when she found out she was adopted and decided to track down her real father after her biological mother passed away.

But after excitedly showing up on his doorstep in 2001 Hollie's decision to locate Paul - who is now in prison - would turn out to be one of the biggest mistakes of her life. 

'When I arrived, a man with grey hair answered the door and asked me if he could help,' she said. 'I told him I was his daughter and though he looked shocked, he pulled me in for a hug.

'He said he had been waiting for the moment he got to meet me,' she said.

Miss Davey and her father spent the night catching up then he asked her to move in with him.

He told Miss Davey he did not want to lose her. She said: 'With those words I felt like I belonged and I settled down in to dad's spare room.'

Hollie has revealed how she rain away from her father after becoming pregnant for the second time 

But while she was keen to develop a father-daughter bond, Miss Davey's father had other ideas. 

Within weeks he was dressing her in a wedding dress and molesting her. 

She said: 'One day while I was reading a magazine dad started to run his fingers though my hair.

'Then he said, "You're gorgeous, I can't believe you're my daughter". It made me feel uneasy. But I was desperate for dad to love me, so I told myself I was just being silly.'

But Davey continued to behave in a way that made his daughter feel uncomfortable. After they had been living together for two months, he suggested playing the game, 'mummies and daddies'.

Miss Davey said: 'I thought it was strange being that I was almost 14, but I didn't want to annoy my dad.'

Davey then handed her a wedding dress and told he to put it on. Hollie said: 'I put it on and played along with him.'

Hollie is now happy with her three daughters, she has no contact with the son she had with her father

Next, her father asked her to pose on the bed so he could take some photos of her wearing the gown.

Miss Davey said: 'It felt wrong but what could I do?' Later that night she heard her bedroom door creak.

'Dad said, "I'll sleep here tonight so I can be with my gorgeous daughter",' Miss Davey said. 'But he started touching me.

'I told him to stop it and tried to pull away but he ignored me and carried on touching me.'

Before long, Davey was visiting his daughter's room every night to molest her. She said: 'He would call me his "special girl" and I would lay in bed limp, trying to pretend it wasn't happening.'

Then one morning, Davey bundled his daughter in to his car and drove her to a deserted road to rape her.

Hollie said: 'He told me to shut up, tore at my clothes and held me down on the passenger seat. I waited for it to be over but dad said, "There's more where that came from".

'I wondered how he could do this to me. I thought he loved me.'

At home, Davey locked his daughter in the house and forced her to wear the wedding dress again.

He took more photos of her, then thrust a silver ring on her wedding ring finger and said, 'I want you to be my wife'.

Miss Davey said: 'I wanted to throw up. He was sick. I felt caged up like an animal.'

Hollie realised she could not hide her experience in case her father was also abusing other children 

After coming forward a second woman also revealed she had been molested by Paul Davey

Davey continued to rape his daughter for months to come and eventually she fell pregnant.

Desperate to end it, he forced her to down a bottle of gin then performed a home abortion with a knitting needle.

Miss Davey said: 'I remember blood running down my legs and it must have panicked my dad because he took me to hospital.

'I wanted to scream at the nurses, "My dad did this to me," but I was petrified of the consequences.

'But if I thought this was going to scare him in to stopping him raping me, I was wrong.'

At 15, Miss Davey fell pregnant a second time, but on this occasion she hid it from her father.

She said: 'Even though the baby had been created by a monster, it was my baby.'

Then one night when her dad was asleep, Miss Davey noticed that the front door was unlocked and made a break for freedom.

She said: 'I realised, I was finally free.' 

Miss Davy gave birth to a son, but social services took him away.

She blamed her father and, determined not to let him destroy any more of her life, she started college and got her own flat.

She went on to have three daughters, then one day she realised that her father was still out there, prowling the streets and could be abusing other children.

She said: 'I realised he couldn't get away with this so I contacted a solicitor and went to the police.'

She underwent DNA tests, which proved her father was in fact her son's dad, too.

Then, a second woman came forward to report that she too had been abused by Miss Davey's father.

In July 2013, Paul Davey, then 63, from Suffolk, appeared at Ipswich Crown Court and pleaded not guilty to rape, indecent assault and one attempt of procuring a miscarriage.

He was convicted of all counts and jailed for 16 years.

Miss Davey said: 'I'll never get over what my dad did. I wish I hadn't gone looking for him. He ruined my childhood. But I'm now back in touch with my adoptive family and am finally happy.'
