Consumer hit: Victoria's Secret has been revealed as the most recognized fashion brand of 2012

The results came from a survey - last carried out in 
2008 - that was sent to women aged 13 to 64, with an average household 
income above $50,000.

Respondents were asked to rate how 
familiar they were with the 1,008 pre-selected brands, with the options 
being 'very familiar,' 'somewhat familiar' or 'not at all familiar.'

WWD cited the 'media blitz' and 'publicity - generated online and at victoriassecret.com and through TV and print ads' as the secret behind Victoria's Secret's success.

PINK, Victoria's Secret's younger label, which is targeted to 15-to-22 year olds, came out at number 94.

Battle of the brands: The classic American clothing labels started by Tommy Hilfiger (left) and Ralph Lauren (right) failed to make it to the top ten, making it to twelfth and thirteenth place respectively

Coming in second place was hosiery brand Hanes, which carries the slogan 'America's First Name In Comfort Since 1901'.

With an estimated ad budget of more than $50 million, and TV adverts featuring celebrities such as Cuba Gooding Jr. and Michael Jordan it has attracted a new a generation of followers.

Old Navy ranked at number three, and Racked.com wrote that its 'ads, which included a 90210 reunion this year, seem to be working'.

Levi’s, Nike, Fruit of the Loom, Calvin Klein, Lee, Gap, Timex were other brands to make the top ten.

A number of foreign brands also made the list including London label Burberry and Italian fashion houses Gucci and Giorgio Armani.

WWD added: 'As always, the brands that spend the most on advertising and marketing and have the widest distribution - largely in mass-retail channels - score the highest.

'But don’t count out the impact of sex, celebrity endorsement, a well-placed mention on the red carpet or even some controversial headlines to get a brand noticed.'
