Some commonly prescribed statins can impair memory, scientists have found

Statins taken by millions of Britons could lead to  memory loss, researchers have warned.

In tests, one of the widely- prescribed drugs cut the ability to form new memories and recall information.

The medication, called pravastatin, was found to have an adverse effect on rats.

Bristol University researchers say their study tallies with reports of statin patients feeling ‘fuzzy-headed’ and ‘befuddled’.

The team also said it was ‘highly likely’ other statins affected memory loss.

But other experts dismissed the research and insisted the benefits of statins outweigh any side-effects.

Statins, which lower levels of ‘bad’ cholesterol in the blood, are the most widely prescribed drugs in Britain and are taken by up to eight million people.

Used to treat those at risk of heart problems and strokes, they are credited with saving thousands of lives a year and some doctors believe that everyone over the age of 50 should be given them.

However, a range of documented side-effects includes muscle and liver problems, blurred vision, fatigue and difficulty sleeping, leading some  doctors to argue they should be reserved only for those at risk of heart problems.

The Bristol neuroscientists looked at the effect of two of the most commonly prescribed statins – pravastatin and atorvastatin – on the memory of rats.

Rodents given pravastatin found it more difficult to learn where a sugary treat was hidden, they discovered.

They also struggled to recall an object they had seen before.

This behaviour was likened by researchers to someone knowing that they have car keys, but not being able to remember where they left them.

It is thought statins may be reducing levels of cholesterol in the brain or affecting its nerve cells directly. 

A quarter of the body’s cholesterol is found inside the head, where it aids the transmission of signals between brain cells.

The
problems vanished shortly after the animals were taken off pravastatin.
Atorvastatin did not affect memory, according to a report in the 
journal PLoS ONE.

It is 
unclear why pravastatin affected memory, as the drug is not thought to 
be able to cross into the brain and atorvastatin is.

Pravastatin (pictured), with the brand name Pravachol, has adverse effects on working and recognition memory. However, atorvastatin, with the brand name Lipitor, does not have any effect

The
Bristol researchers said patients on statins should take note of the 
findings and warned that it is ‘highly likely’ other statins may also 
affect memory.

Professor 
Neil Marrion said: ‘If you notice you are suffering cognitive problems 
or people around you  recognise you are suffering problems, go back to 
your GP and ask for a different statin and you might find the problem 
disappears.’

Others have described the advice as ‘total overkill’.

Consultant
cardiologist Kausik Ray, a member of the British Cardiovascular 
Society, said large-scale studies on frail and elderly people had failed
to find any evidence that statins damage memory.

‘I don’t do rat research, I do large-scale population research,’ he said.

‘There is a reason that people are on statins – and that is to reduce the risk of heart disease and strokes.’

The
drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory products Agency
(MHRA), said memory loss is already listed as a potential side-effect 
of statins.

A spokesman 
added: ‘The benefits of statins are well established and outweigh the 
risk of side-effects in most patients who take them. We are aware of 
this study and, as with all medicines, the safety of statins continues 
to be monitored closely.’
