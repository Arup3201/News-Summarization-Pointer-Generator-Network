Energy production is fueling a huge population growth in the West of the U.S, with Texas home to four of the top 10 fastest growing cities - San Marcos, Cedar Park, Georgetown and Frisco.

The energy industry is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the U.S economy and the oil and gas-rich fields of the Great Plains and Mountain West are luring huge numbers of people to them.

San Marcos, Frisco and Cedar Park were No. 1, 2 and 4 in percentage population growth between 2012 and 2013, each growing by at least five per cent in that time span, new data from the Census Bureau shows.

This is the second year in a row that San Marcos, centrally located between Austin and San Antonio on Interstate 35, has topped the list of fastest-growing cities with a population of more than 50,000. Its population grew by 8 percent between July 2012 and 2013 to 54,076 people.

That's well ahead of its 2011-12 increase of 4.9 percent, which pushed San Marcos into the upper echelon of cities with 50,000-plus people.

Mayor Daniel Guerrero, in Chicago recruiting business investment for his city, said that in addition to its enviable location between Austin and San Antonio, San Marcos has one of the nation's largest outlet malls and is home of the 35,000-student Texas State University.

‘We have an immaculate natural beauty to our community, certainly the spring-fed river ... San Marcos River... historic neighborhoods, a growing and beautified downtown that we've been investing in heavily over the last few years,’ Guerrero said. The presence and growth of the university is also a factor, he said.

By population increase, New York City is still on top, growing by 61,440 people in 2012 to 8.4million people in 2013. In addition to having the largest numerical increase, New York City is also still the largest city in the United States by population.

Houston increased by 35,202 people to 2.2million in 2013. Los Angeles grew by 31,525 to 3.8million.

The Census Bureau also said that 14 cities joined the 50,000-plus population club: Casa Grande and Aliso Viejo, Arizona; Dublin and Palm Desert, California; Doral, Florida; Huntersville, North Carolina; Enid, Oklahoma; Grapevine, Texas; Ankeny, Iowa; Lenexa, Kansas; Kentwood, Michigan; Apple Valley, Minnesota; Tigard, Oregon; and Sammamish, Washington.
