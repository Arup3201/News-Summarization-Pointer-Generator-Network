Tragic: Grandmother Joyce Moulson, 84, collapsed and died just a few minutes after vandals bombarded her house in Bradford with rocks

A grandmother died moments after youths pelted her house with stones, an inquest heard today.

Joyce Moulson, 84, was at home making dinner for her grandson when a rock broke one of the windows in her front door.

She was spotted in her back yard looking 'very annoyed' and searching for a dustpan and brush to clean up the broken glass.

Ms Moulson told a neighbour 'some b***** just got my front door window' before collapsing moments later.

She was rushed to hospital but died later that evening, an inquest at Bradford Coroner’s Court heard.

Forensic pathologist Dr Matt Lyall said she had an underlying hypertensive heart disease which caused her death. But the doctor added that the stress of the vandalism may have lead to her dying.

He said in a statement: 'It seems logical to consider the upset and anger caused by the incident was capable of placing increased physiological demands upon her heart.

'Whilst I cannot be certain it seems reasonable to conclude that the stress apparently caused by the incident has probably made some contribution to this woman's death by exacerbating her underlying heart disease, although she could have died suddenly from the heart disease.'

Neighbour Philip Mudd said after the stone was thrown he helped her find a shovel to clean up the broken glass and they both went into her house.

He said: 'I thought she tripped over the door frame. Then she just went down like a sack of potatoes.'

Mr Mudd described her 'fighting', occasionally regaining consciousness, as he and her grandson tried to help until paramedics arrived.

He described his neighbour as 'bubbly', adding: 'She would do anything for anyone, never complaining. She was a nice person.'

Assistant Deputy Coroner Mary Burke 
recorded a narrative verdict, saying: 'Joyce Moulson had developed 
significant hypertensive heart disease.

'She collapsed very shortly after a pane of glass at her house had been smashed by youths. She was taken to Bradford Royal infirmary but sadly died there.'

The coroner added: 'It cannot be clearly established that there is a definite link between Mrs Moulson's death being caused by what happened.

'The pathologist says it may have made some contribution, but he also says she could have collapsed at any time.'

The court also heard from Detective Chief Inspector Simon Atkinson, the Chief Investigating Officer into Mrs Moulson's death.

He told how the police had identified four youths who were in the vicinity in Wibsey, Bradford, West Yorkshire, at around 5.30pm on November 27 last year.

They were arrested in connection with both the damage to the elderly lady's house and also her death.

But they 'weren't able to establish beyond all reasonable doubt proof that would support criminal proceedings' in respect of Mrs Moulson.

A 13-year-old youth, who cannot be named, was prosecuted for criminal damage and received a youth rehabilitation order earlier this year.
