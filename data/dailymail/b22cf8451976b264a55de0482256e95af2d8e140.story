YouTube has dropped the strongest hint yet that it is planning to introduce subscriptions for video content.

The plan was revealed in fragments of code in the latest update of the YouTube app - and comes after claims the Google-owned site could introduce the new paid-for model as early as this spring.

The move is being viewed as an aggressive move by the world's most popular streaming video site to compete directly with traditional television services for viewers and advertisers.

Get your credit cards ready... Fragments of code 
in the latest YouTube's mobile app update offer the strongest hint yet 
that the online streaming video service is set to introduce subscriptions for paid-for content

The code, unearthed by Android operating system fan blog Android Police, seems to describe a function in the app which tells users they can only subscribe to or unsubscribe from paid channels from their desktop or laptop computers.

It reads: '<string name="paid_channel_subscribe_message">You can only subscribe to this paid channel on your computer.</string>'

And: '<string name="paid_channel_unsubscribe_message">You can only unsubscribe from this paid channel on your computer.</string>'

The discoveries have not yet been confirmed, but the messages apparently hidden within the code appear to back up reports last month that claimed YouTube would soon begin asking users to pay to access some content.

The company has held talks with several video producers, asking them to submit applications to create for-pay specialist channels, according to AdAge.

The first such channels could be available at Easter and YouTube is expected to charge between 60p ($1) and £3 ($5) a month.

In addition to episodic content, 
YouTube is also considering charging for content libraries and access to
 live events, a la pay-per-view, as well as self-help or financial 
advice shows.

Benefit to content creators: YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar has talked about the 
website's potential to provide second- or third-tier cable networks with
 a more direct channel to their passionate viewers

YouTube, has been moving to add 
professional-grade video programmes to the vast archive of 
amateur-produced, home-shot videos that have made the site so popular.

Twitter executives have vowed the introduction of a new advertising model will not lead to users seeing more adverts on the website - yet.

Twitter users already sometimes see paid-for tweets among the posts from people, organisations and companies they have chosen to follow.

But the microblogging site's new Ads API (application programming interface) will let advertisers better tailor their campaigns to relevant members of Twitter's 200million active users.

Facebook launched similar technology in 2010, helping the social network to boost its revenues to more than $3billion the following year.

As speculation grows that Twitter will follow Facebook with a stock market float, it seems the company's executives likewise hope to unlock their sites moneymaking potential.

Twitter product manager April Underwood told the Financial Times there would be 'no direct impact on the user experience', merely that the service's users should see 'more relevant and better ads'.

She did not rule out an increase in the number of ads shown, but insisted the company took users' experience 'really seriously'.

Currently all content is available to consumers for free and is supported by advertising that appears alongside the videos.

YouTube has hinted in the past that it was considering offering subscription-based paid content.

At a media conference last year, CEO Salar Kamangar talked about the potential to poach second- or third-tier networks having trouble building big enough audiences on cable to command subscription fees from distributors.

Internet distribution, the thinking goes, would give some of these networks a more direct line to their passionate base with lower costs.

'If we have a subscription model, then absolutely that's something that becomes possible,' said Mr Kamangar.

'We have long maintained that different content requires different types of payment models,' a Google spokesman said, in a statement.

'The important thing is that, regardless of the model, our creators succeed on the platform.

'There are a lot of our content creators that think they would benefit from subscriptions, so we're looking at that.'

YouTube is treating paid subscriptions as an experiment, much like video rentals when it began in 2010.

The initial group of channels will be small, estimated at about 25 at the outset.
