Lying in a private room on the labour ward, exhausted from giving birth, I desperately tried to block out the noise all around me.

The screams of a woman in labour gave way to the cry of a newborn baby. I heard the father phoning relatives, elated as he announced the arrival of his daughter. It was too much for me to bear.

For as I cradled my baby girl Emily, tenderly stroking her soft, plump cheeks, my husband Richard and I stared at her tiny chest, willing it to rise and fall, yet knowing it never would.

Grieving: Richard and Michelle Daniels who lost daughter Emily

Emily had been stillborn by emergency caesarean at 11.31pm on December 19, weighing 8lb 1oz. Her heart, which we’d heard beating so loudly on a monitor at the hospital that morning, had stopped during labour. Quite why, no one knew at that point.

We had been robbed of the life we’d imagined as a family of four with our five-year-old son, Finlay. I’d had a healthy pregnancy and all the indications from the scans were that my baby was healthy.

In the moments after her birth, as we were consumed by sadness, our pain was only compounded by our surroundings on a ward full of the sounds of new life. 

The room was cold and clinical, a place for enduring the physical pain of labour, not mourning the tragic death of a baby. A Perspex cot stood empty in one corner, leaflets on breastfeeding littered a table and there was a neat pile of baby clothes provided by the hospital for parents who aren’t prepared for their new arrival.

There was no sofa or double bed on which Richard and I could sit close, our arms around each other, holding Emily together. There was no soundproofing to silence the noise beyond the room or soft lighting. Only reminders all around us of what we’d just lost.

As a nurse, I cannot fault the care we received at the Queen’s Medical Centre (QMC) in Nottingham, where Emily was born. Yet while still in the throes of our grief, there are two things Richard and I are certain we don’t want.

The first is pity, because we are far from the only family to suffer such a shattering loss. The second is for any other couple to endure the agony of spending their few precious moments with their stillborn infant with the audible backdrop of a labour suite or maternity ward.

This is the reason we want to share our story to raise awareness of the need for bereavement suites in hospital maternity units.

Michelle recalls: 'In the moments after her birth, as we were consumed by sadness, our pain was only compounded by our surroundings on a ward full of the sounds of new life'

We hope to raise £50,000 for such a facility at the QMC and others at hospitals across the country.I married Richard, who is 37 and has his own accountancy and management consultancy, in May 2005 and Finlay was born in November 2008.

When I found out I was pregnant last spring, we were delighted.

At the 20-week scan, however, I was told I had a condition called placenta previa, where the placenta blocks the cervix, making a natural birth impossible.

But it often rights itself, so I was put under the care of a brilliant obstetrician and given regular scans to monitor it.

Finlay had been desperate to know the sex of ‘his’ baby and helped pick out the exact shade of pink for his sister’s bedroom.

Two weeks before my baby was due, a scan showed the placenta had moved, meaning I could have a natural birth after all.

On December 19, I went to the hospital for an appointment to kickstart labour. That’s when we listened to our baby’s heart beating so loudly.

Stillbirth is 15 times more common than cot death, according to official figures

We returned home and by early evening the contractions were coming fast, so we abandoned Finlay’s bedtime story and made a mad dash to take him to stay with Richard’s parents.

On arrival at the QMC at 9pm, two midwives immediately got a monitor to listen to my baby’s heartbeat.

When they couldn’t hear it, they assumed there was a fault with the machine or it was due to the position in which I was lying. But a second monitor was also silent. Suddenly there was panic in the room.

The registrar arrived with a portable ultrasound machine and spoke the words we never wanted to hear: our baby wasn’t moving and it was suspected she’d died. I’d need an emergency caesarean to deliver her.

What happened after that is a blur. I remember lying on the operating table with Richard standing beside me, sobbing.

We clung to the hope there had been a mistake and our baby was still alive or that they would be able to revive her.

When she was delivered, we held our breath, praying she’d cry. But there was no sound except the beeping of machines and our sobs. Wrapped in a pink blanket, our daughter was brought to us by the midwife in the recovery room a few minutes later.

We decided to call her Emily. It wasn’t on our shortlist of names, but it was pretty, just like her, and it was so important to us that she had an identity.

Emily was perfect and with lots of dark brown hair. She looked very much like Finlay did as a baby, with a button nose and beautiful rosebud lips.

Her cheeks felt soft and warm and there was a flicker when we touched them, which is a normal reflex action. We simply couldn’t believe she was never going to open her eyes.

A small funeral was held on January 7 with only Michelle and Richard's parents, siblings and one of the midwives present

The theatre staff were upset, particularly the anaesthetist, who confided that his sister had suffered two stillbirths.

That’s when we started to realise how common this is. There is a one in 200 chance of having a stillborn baby — that’s as many as 17 a day in Britain. At the QMC, there have been two more since we lost Emily.

At 4am, Richard called our parents to give them the heart-wrenching news that their longed for granddaughter hadn’t survived. They were distraught.

But how were we going to explain it to Finlay?

At dawn, Richard left Emily and me to go to him. I have no idea how he had the strength to tell Finlay that Emily had been poorly and had gone to live with the angels. Apparently, he buried his head in his daddy’s shoulder and cried his little heart out.

On the second night, Richard stayed with Finlay while my mum sat with me at the hospital, holding me as I became increasingly traumatised by the sounds of families celebrating new arrivals.

When Richard returned the next morning, he had to pass new fathers excitedly carrying baby car seats into the hospital. The midwife gave us a white cardboard memory box in the shape of a treasure chest containing a teddy bear, candle and kit with which to take prints of Emily’s hands and feet, which we did before leaving hospital later that day.

Though I was desperate to get home to Finlay and away from the labour suite, it was agonising saying goodbye to our daughter, who was taken to the chapel of rest.

Michelle says 'I have no idea how he (husband Richard) had the strength to tell Finlay (their son) that Emily had been poorly and had gone to live with the angels'

We had a small funeral on January 7 with only our parents, siblings and one of the midwives present. Richard and I had an hour-and-a-half at home alone with Emily that morning.

We wanted to feel her presence in our house, to cradle her in her bedroom and know she’d once been there.

In February, there was more agony when the test results came back. It revealed I’d had an antenatal condition where the placenta functions during pregnancy, but fails under the stress of labour.

There’s no way of screening for it during pregnancy as it can be diagnosed only by tests following a stillbirth.

The tragic irony is that had the placenta previa not rectified itself in those final weeks, I’d have had a planned caesarean and the chances are Richard and I would have a healthy baby.

When we took the first steps towards setting up our charity, Forever Stars, in January, we aimed for 100 followers on our Facebook page.

We now have more than 4,000 from Alaska to Australia, and have received messages from 1,000 parents who were left to grieve for their stillborn baby in hospital in similar circumstances.

The same story recurs — the medical care and staff are fantastic, but hospitals don’t have a private place to grieve and spend precious time with your baby.

When we spoke to them, the QMC told us they had already recognised a need for a dedicated, peaceful but medically equipped bereavement suite.

Richard and I would love to try for another baby, but there’s a risk I’d have the same placenta problem, so I’d be given a caesarean at 37 weeks.

Like Finlay, he or she will grow up knowing they had a beautiful sister called Emily, who will be part of our family forever.
