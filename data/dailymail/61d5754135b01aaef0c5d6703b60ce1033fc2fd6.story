For plenty, the World Cup coming to an end is unwelcome after more than a month of explosive football on the biggest of stages.

But Brazil, just as they did for the opening ceremony, were looking to make sure they see off the 2014 World Cup with a bang.

The location? The Maracana in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The reason? Celebrating the World Cup final between Argentina and Germany arriving.

Among those spotted for the showdown was American football star Tom Brady, who was getting cosy with his Brazilian supermodel wife Gisele Bundchen, and FIFA President Sepp Blatter, who was chatting to former Barcelona star Carles Puyol and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
