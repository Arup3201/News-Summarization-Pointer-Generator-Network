Charities and businesses will be given cash incentives to get jobless under-18s 'earning or learning', Nick Clegg announced today.

The Deputy Prime Minister hopes to defuse the 'ticking time bomb' of youth unemployment with a £126million scheme across England

Organisations will receive up to £2,200 for every young person they help.

They will receive an initial payment up front, and more money when the youngsters show progress.

Mr Clegg meets young apprentices at K&M McLoughlin Decorating in Islington last week as he appealed for businesses to sign up to the Youth Contract

Unemployment soared in the three months to December

And they will be given 'total freedom' in the methods they use to get 16 and 17-year-olds into work or training.

The initiative is part of the coalition's Youth Contract scheme, announced last November in a bid to tackle youth unemployment.

Mr Clegg said: 'Sitting at home with nothing to do when you're so young can knock the stuffing out of you for years.

'It is a tragedy for the young people involved - a ticking time bomb for the economy and our society as a whole.

'This problem isn't new, but in the current economic climate we urgently need to step up efforts to ensure some of our most troubled teenagers have the skills, confidence and opportunities to succeed.

'Many of them will have complex problems: truancy, teenage pregnancy, a lack of GCSEs and health problems.

'So helping them onto their feet will not be without challenges and Government cannot do this alone.

'But we all have a duty to reach out to the young people who can be hardest to reach.

'That's
why today I am calling on charities and other organisations at the coal
face to work with Government to help tens and thousands of lost 
teenagers onto a brighter path.'

Around 55,000 Neets (not in education, 
employment or training) who do not hold any GCSEs at grade C or above 
will be targeted for the scheme, which is similar to the Government's 
Work Programme that sees private contractors paid a fee for getting and 
keeping adults in employment.

But officials were keen to stress it is the first time the payment-by-results approach has been taken with the younger age group.

Organisations will receive an initial fee for taking teenagers on but further payments will only be made when progress - such as sticking with training programmes, undertaking apprenticeships, or holding down jobs - can be shown.

Three areas - Liverpool, Leeds-Bradford-Wakefield and Newcastle-Gateshead - will be able to allocate their own pot of money as part of the Government City Deal, set up to give more autonomy to England's core cities.

Speaking on Sky News this morning, Mr Clegg said: 'I think it is incredibly important that, at that very vital moment in someone’s life, when they are in their teens, that they don’t lose the ambition and the hope and the optimism about working.

'Because once that is lost, all the evidence is that it has a long-term scarring effect and makes it very difficult for youngsters to move into stable employment as adults.'

Children's Minister Tim Loughton said: 'We are committed to supporting those 16 and 17-year-olds who have found it hard to find training or work upon leaving school.

Growing problem: Unemployment jumped by nearly 50,000 in the quarter to last December, giving the worst figures since 1995

'We want them to receive personal, targeted support from experts who will give them the confidence, skills and motivation to stay in education or find a job with training.

'Providers know how best to support young people back into education training and employment. It's time we put them back on the road to success.

'We are looking forward to receiving some innovative ideas that really work from experienced organisations in all sectors.'

This group of teenagers has been singled out because evidence suggests that unemployment early on can have a permanent effect on earning potential.

By the age of 42, someone who has been frequently unemployed as a teenager is likely to earn 12-15 per cent less than their peers, the Department for Education said.

The announcement comes less than a week after the latest unemployment figures showed that the numbers of 16 to 24-year-olds not in work increased by 22,000 to 1.04million in the three months to December.

The last Neets figures, for the third quarter of last year, showed that more than a million 16 to 24-year-olds (1,163,000) - almost one in five - were (not in education, employment or training.
