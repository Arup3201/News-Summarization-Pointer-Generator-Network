Still at it: Gangster 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, 89, has been given an ASBO for arguing at his care home

He was jailed for the first time  at 13, after stealing a packet of cigarettes.

More than seven decades later, it seems ‘Mad’ Frankie Fraser has no intention of giving up his notorious career of crime.

The East End gangster, now 89, was given an Asbo for arguing with another pensioner at his care home.

His son, David, said staff called police because they feared the ‘screaming and shouting’ would escalate.

He explained yesterday: ‘They were always rowing and it ended up with the police being called.

'The other man had dementia and was not all there. All he did was bark back at him.

‘He said it was about rowing as they were all screaming and shouting at each other.

'My dad ended up with an Asbo, but he was not the only person to get one. He laughed about it.

'They said it was effectively a warning. It didn’t make much difference to him and he carried on as he normally did. It was a really funny turnout.'

The anti-social behaviour order was issued two years ago after Fraser was admitted to sheltered accommodation in Bermondsey, South East London, when living alone became ‘too much for him’, his family said.

Reunion: Frankie had connections with the Krays. Here he is pictured greeting Reggie Kray at the funeral of his older brother Charles Junior in 2000

History: As well as knowing the Krays, Fraser dated Marilyn Wisbey (pictured with him in 1997) - daughter of Great Train Robber Tom Wisbey. The picture to the right shows him in 1956 before he was jailed for seven years

Fraser is one of the last surviving 
‘celebrity criminals’. He has spent 42 years – almost half his life – in
prison for 26 offences.

He was a member of the Richardson gang, and widely feared in London’s underworld.

Yesterday David said his father was in poor health, and described the Asbo as ‘like something out of a comedy sketch’.

Fraser now lives in another nursing home in Southwark, just a few miles from his regular haunts during his criminal career.

His son added: ‘There are no problems
now and the other people in the home are very protective of him. He’s 
quite popular among them because he likes to treat them if he gets a few
quid. They all know about his background, because they are all from the
same area.

Notorious: 'Mad' Frankie, was a member of the Richardson gang where he helped brothers Eddie and Charlie run an empire of extortion and fraud based on fear and terror

Not looking back: 'Mad' Frankie, whose life is portrayed in a new documentary, has said he would not have lived his life any other way and only regrets 'getting caught'

'He’s got his own flat and his own life. The people there love him to bits and he loves them too.'

Details of the Asbo were revealed in a
new documentary, Frankie Fraser’s Last Stand. He earned the nickname 
‘Mad’ Frankie after faking mental illness to avoid being called up to 
fight during the Second World War.

After the war he joined the Richardson gang as their enforcer.

In 1967 Fraser was jailed for a 
decade in the famous ‘torture trial’ for punishing those who owed money 
or had angered his bosses.

During the trial, he was accused of 
pulling out his victims’ teeth with pliers. Two years after his final 
release, in 1991, he was shot in the head.

In the following years he began to cash in on his reputation as a ‘celebrity criminal’ and wrote four books.

- Frankie Fraser’s Last Stand will be broadcast on the Crime and Investigation network on June 16.
