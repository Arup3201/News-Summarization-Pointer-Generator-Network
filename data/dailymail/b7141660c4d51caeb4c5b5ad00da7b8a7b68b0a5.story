An intruder has been arrested after breaking into George Clooney’s luxurious Italian holiday villa on Lake Como.

The man scaled the walls of the star’s luxurious £25million second home, Villa Oleandra, in the lakeside village of Laglio, and helped himself to the wine cellar before moving onto the main house.

Clooney was not at home.

The news will come as a shock to the Hollywood star who has owned the 30-room property for more than a decade and is reportedly making plans for an Italian wedding to barrister fiancée Amal Alamuddin in September.

The trespasser climbed the outer wall, gaining access to the immaculately maintained gardens.

He then allegedly helped himself to a bottle of liquor from a wine cellar, before attempting to force the main entrance to the house.

A maid, who forms part of the Hollywood star’s maintenance staff, spotted an apparent thief and called police.

George Clooney's villa was also once owned by the Heinz Family. The villa also served as the filming location for some scenes of the movie Ocean's Twelve

When the military police of Como arrived at the property the man allegedly threatened them with the bottle, but officers quickly overpowered him.

A 29-year-old Romanian man has been arrested, a spokesman for Carabinieri police in Como said.

Clooney reportedly considered selling the villa, which has its own private jetty, swimming pool and tennis court, in 2010, when attention from the public and paparazzi grew too much.

But the mayor introduced a local law banning strangers from gathering outside his property, on pain of a £15 fine.
