Russian police have captured an on-the-run nanny who was recorded on a hidden camera beating an 11-month-old baby and throwing him around the room.

Businessman Mark Tikhonov, 43, hired 53-year-old Larissa Ulyanova online and asked her to look after his son in Chelyabinsk, a city in central Russia's Chelyabinsk Oblast region.

He said that when they were around she had seemed attentive and caring for the baby boy but he became suspicious because the child seemed distressed every time he was handed over to her.

Hidden camera footage also revealed the moment the nanny appeared to strike the baby boy (pictured left)

In another scene caught on camera, she dangled him upside down as she puts on his clothes 

Mr Tikhonov said: 'I didn't for a second think she was abusing him, and I even took two weeks off work to try and help the pair of them get to know each other better.

'When I was around she was always caring and attentive.'

But after his son's distress continued he decided to install a hidden camera, which captured shocking images of the boy barely able to walk being picked up and flung onto the sofa, slapped on the face or having his legs knocked out from under him to force him to fall back down into his baby chair.

After the footage was handed to police, they launched a search for the woman who has now been tracked down and arrested.

A medical test of the baby has now been completed that showed he was suffering from damaged vertebrae, although it was not possible to confirm that this was at the hands of his nanny.

However prosecutors have given the go-ahead now to charge the woman, who faces up to seven years in jail for the violent attack on the child.

The slaps and the aggression were clearly designed to cause distress to the boy but at the same time not to leave marks that would make the parents suspicious.

After seeing the footage of the abuse, the furious dad had confronted Ulyanova when she turned up for work and she fled the apartment and went on the run.

The parents filed a complaint with police who confirmed they had tracked her down and later arrested her over child cruelty.

Mr Tikhonov said: 'My little boy is now nervous and afraid and is going to need a lot of love and care to get over his ordeal.'
