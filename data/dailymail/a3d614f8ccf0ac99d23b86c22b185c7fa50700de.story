Not content with walking in an average of 50 shows a season and fronting campaigns for Chanel, Burberry and Saint Laurent, Cara Delevingne appears intent on making it big in Japan as well.

The 21-year-old appears in a kooky new commercial launched by Japanese online mall La Boo, which shows her dancing around a bedroom in her knickers as well as deploying her trademark gurn for the cameras.

The clip begins with the British model perched on the bed in a teen dream of a bedroom before jumping up and trying on - in true teenage style - five different outfits.

Eventually, the model finds one she likes and is seen leaving the house, toy horse in hand, whispering: 'I love La Boo'.

La Boo, according to a report in the
Telegraph , is aimed at teenage girls and stocks international high 
street brands such as Topshop as well as local labels.

Delevingne is currently a model in demand and walked for Burberry Prorsum and Marc Jacobs, among others, during last month's round of fashion shows, as well as starring in Chanel's 2013 Resort campaign.

The model, who has often spoken of her acting and singing ambitions, is also planning to launch a pop career according reports in the Sunday Mirror.

A source told the paper: 'She loves music, she loves festivals and she loves singing. Now, she wants to add it to her CV and actually get herself a pop career.

'She is a very busy girl at the 
moment, with a couple of movies lined up as well as her modelling. Now 
it looks like things will be kicking off for her musically next year.'

Delevingne,
who had a small role as Princess Sorokina in last year's adaptation of 
Anna Karenina opposite Aaron Taylor-Johnson, has also been making 
progress in her acting career.

In
August, it was announced that she would play a DJ in the Grand Theft 
Auto V computer game, while earlier this month, she was rumoured to have
landed a part in new film, Face of an Angel.

Although Delevingne won't play the lead role in the Amanda Knox biopic, reports suggested she had signed on alongside veteran actors Daniel Bruhl and Colin Firth.

And the model already has three roles in the pipeline, including Kids in Love and a film adaption of Martin Amis' novel London Fields, starring Amber Heard and Billy Bob Thornton - all of which are likely to prove popular with her new Japanese fans.
