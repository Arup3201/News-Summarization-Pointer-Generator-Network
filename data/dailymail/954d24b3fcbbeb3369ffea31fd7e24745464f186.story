A New York man who is a dead ringer for Family Guy character Peter Griffin has become an internet star - with footage of him impersonating Griffin getting millions of hits in just 48 hours. 

Robert Franzese, from Long Island, had fans of the show doing a double-take, after he attended the Com Con comic book convention in Griffin's trademark, green trousers and white shirt.

But it was when the 26-year-old opened his mouth at the New York event and mimicked the high-pitched character to perfection that fans really freaked out.

A video of Mr Franzese impersonating Griffin at the Com Con comic book convention got 3.5 million hits in just 48 hours and he received 22,000 likes on Facebook

In less than 48 hours, a YouTube video of the impersonator at the convention had racked up more than 3.5 million views.

Mr Franzese got a further 22,000 likes on his Facebook page, where Family Guy fans from around the world applauded his likeness to the animated character.

Mr Franzese said he realised he sounded like Peter Griffin 'very early on', and after becoming a fan of the show in high school he started mimicking the character's voice. The impersonation came much later.

He said: 'A lot of people get really excited when they see me dressed as Peter Griffin, but they get into what I like to refer to as overload excited when they hear me speak.

'Since I have gone viral a few times now, sometimes I get recognised at shows.'

Mr Franzese said Family Guy's creator, Seth McFarlane, had shown his approval of his impersonations by re-tweeting a video of him acting as Griffin.

He said: 'This has all been really amazing. The amount of support I've been receiving is mind-blowing.

'My ultimate goal in life is to become a voice actor.

'It would be awesome to make a career out of going to conventions too.'
