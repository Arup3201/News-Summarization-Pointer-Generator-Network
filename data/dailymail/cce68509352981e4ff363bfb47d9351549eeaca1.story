Baptised: Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, 38, was captured and killed by terrorists in Karachi

The unfurling scandal of Mormons posthumously baptising Jews took another turn for the worse today as it was revealed the same was done to a famous U.S. reporter murdered in Pakistan.

Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, 38, was captured and killed by terrorists in Karachi months after 9/11 in February 2002 while he was probing links between Al Qaeda and Pakistan.

Now it has been revealed the Jewish journalist was baptised by proxy in June 2011 at a Mormon temple in Twin Falls, Idaho, in a practice that has already been causing outrage among Jews.

His wife Marine, who was pregnant with their son Adam when her husband died, said he would ‘laugh because it’s a silly’ and told the Boston Globe that the whole thing is ‘a bit surreal’.

‘We appreciate your good intentions but rest assured Danny’s soul was redeemed through the life that he lived and the values that he upheld,’ his parents Judea and Ruth Pearl told the Mormon Church, speaking to Boston Globe.

‘He lived as a proud Jew, died as a proud Jew, and is currently facing his creator as a Jew, blessed, accepted and redeemed,’ they added, saying the news of his baptism was ‘disturbing’.

The finding was made by Helen Radkey, an ex-Mormon who is rising to fame by going through Church databases to spot posthumous baptisms of Jews - especially Holocaust survivors.

The controversy last week caught the eye 
of Catholic comedian Stephen Colbert, who gave his own take on it by 
‘converting all dead Mormons to Judaism’ using a hot dog sausage and a 
cigar cutter.

That came after it was revealed earlier this month that Anne Frank, who died during the Holocaust in 1945 at Bergen-Belsen in Germany, was baptised by a Mormon for the tenth time in 23 years.

Meanwhile Holocaust survivor and 83-year-old author Elie Wiesel recently learned several of his relatives who died under the Nazis were posthumously baptised by Mormons.

The Church is coming under more scrutiny thanks to Broadway show The Book of Mormon and the presidential campaign of Mitt Romney, who allegedly once helped baptise an atheist relative.

Anne was posthumously baptised by a 
Mormon at a Dominican Republic temple for the first time in 13 years. 
The same was done to the parents of late Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal earlier
this month.

This issue has caused a religious storm 
after an agreement from 1995 required Mormons to avoid submitting names 
of Holocaust victims for baptism unless they are their direct ancestors.

Mormons often perform the baptisms, saying people who died that did not get the chance to be baptised while living can choose to accept or deny it. But the issue is distressing many relatives.

The Church has said sorry for all posthumous baptisms of Jews that have caused concern. A spokesman for the Church said it ‘keeps its word’ on not baptising Holocaust victims anymore.

This latest incident was a ‘protocol breach’ because the baptism was not performed by a relative. The Church itself described this as ‘distressing’, insisting that it wants to stamp out the practice.
