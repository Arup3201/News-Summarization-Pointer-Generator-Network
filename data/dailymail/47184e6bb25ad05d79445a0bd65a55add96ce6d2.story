A teacher has died after being crushed against her car as she loaded it with shopping in a supermarket car park.

Mother-of-four Tracey Askham became trapped by her Mini Cooper when it was hit by a Suzuki Vitara.

The 47-year-old was taken to Leeds General Infirmary following the accident outside Morrisons in the village of Idle, near Bradford, West Yorkshire, but died a week later.

A statement published on the website 
of Immanuel College, in Thackley, said: ‘It is with great sadness that 
we have learnt of the death of Tracey Askham, a much loved and respected
member of our Immanuel family.

‘Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and friends.’

Staff
and pupils also laid flowers and tributes to an ‘inspirational’ and 
‘brilliant’ teacher outside the Church of England secondary school, 
where she had worked since 2001.

One wrote: ‘Mrs Askham was a wonderful,
loyal woman.  She would do anything in the world to make every single 
student in school become successful and achieve their goal in life. 
She’d do anything to help others.’

Another tribute read: ‘You were a brilliant teacher. You will be sadly missed by everyone.’

A
further card said Mrs Askham, who had two grandchildren, was ‘amazing 
and an inspiration’, while another pupil described her as ‘the best 
teacher ever’.

training.

Facebook was also

saying she was a ‘beautiful woman inside and out’.

Lowde said: ‘Just been to Immanuel to lay some flowers. In absolute awe
of the beauty.  What a beautiful tribute to a beautiful lady.
