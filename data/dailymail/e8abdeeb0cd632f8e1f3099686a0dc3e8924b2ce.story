British soldiers will continue to patrol with Afghan troops – even though Nato has scaled back joint missions following a series of deadly attacks by rogue soldiers and policemen.

The recent spate of ‘green on blue’ killings – in which allied troops are killed by the Afghan soldiers they are training – has prompted Nato commanders to reduce the number of joint patrols.

But Defence Secretary Philip Hammond insisted the announcement by the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) would have ‘minimal’ impact on operations by UK forces.

Tributes: Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province

He appeared to have been unaware of 
the change – and was hauled to the Commons to explain why he had briefed
 MPs a day earlier that there would be no change in strategy.

Rogue security forces have killed 51 
coalition troops this year – including nine British servicemen, a 
quarter of the 35 killed in 2012.

On Saturday, father-of-two Sergeant 
Gareth Thursby, 29, and Private Tom Wroe, 18, both of the 3rd Battalion 
the Yorkshire Regiment, were murdered by an Afghan policeman at a 
checkpoint in Nahr-e Saraj.

Labour MP Denis MacShane, left, today sought to force Mr Hammond to appear before MPs and answer an urgent question about the decision to scale back Nato joint patrols with Afghan soldiers

IUS General John Allen said only large 
strike operations will now be conducted jointly, with smaller patrols 
evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a senior regional commander.

Isaf said the measure was ‘prudent, but temporary, to reduce our profile and vulnerability to insider attacks’.

But Mr Hammond appeared to be 
blind-sided by the announcement and was dragged before the Commons to 
clarify the UK’s approach to mentoring and training.

He was only 
informed of the shift in a video conference with military chiefs on 
Monday afternoon – fuelling concerns that the policy of training Afghan 
forces was in chaos.

Speaking to the Commons yesterday, Mr 
Hammond insisted there was ‘no significant change’ for British troops.

He said they would continue to train, mentor and fight alongside Afghan 
soldiers and policemen in small groups after approval had come from US 
Major General Mark Gurganus, the commander in charge of Helmand.

He added: ‘There is no change of 
strategy. We will continue routinely in Task Force Helmand to partner at
 lower levels.

'The United States have never, or not in recent years, 
routinely partnered at levels below the battalion.

'So there is no 
practical impact on operations.’

But elsewhere in Afghanistan, commanders suspended all joint operations except large ones involving more than 800 troops.

Christopher Raible, 40, were the two Marines killed in an insurgent 
attack on Afghanistan's Camp Bastion on Friday

It raised fresh questions why smaller 
groups of British servicemen and women were being placed at greater risk
 by living and working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Afghan army and 
police.

The latest decision strikes at the heart of Nato’s exit 
strategy.

The main justification for troops 
being in Afghanistan is the training of Afghan security forces to handle
 the situation once UK forces withdraw in 2014.

But the policy has been 
fraught with danger as the Taliban has encouraged recruits to kill their
 international mentors.

Anger among Afghans has been fuelled 
by the recent anti-Islam film in the US.

Mr Hammond admitted the stream 
of ‘green on blue’ attacks were ‘sapping’ morale.

‘That is why we are 
determined to solve this problem, to nip this trend in the bud and make 
sure we get on top of this,’ he said.

Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy 
said: ‘It does appear to be a really significant change in the 
relationship between UK, Isaf and Afghan forces.

‘If the approach is we won’t 
automatically partner smaller Afghan forces at company level on a 
routine basis, what impact will this have on training of individual 
Afghan recruits by UK forces?’

Tory MP John Baron, who called the 
urgent debate, said Isaf’s announcement ‘threatened to blow a hole’ in 
Britain’s exit strategy.

Labour MP Paul Flynn Labour was 
suspended from the Commons for accusing defence ministers of lying.

alling for an immediate withdrawal of UK troops, he said: ‘The role of 
our brave soldiers at the moment is to act as human shields for 
ministers’ reputations.

Dangerous: A protest in Kabul over the film that mocks the Prophet Muhammad turned violent Monday, with hundreds of men torching tires, cars and shipping containers and lobbing rocks at a U.S. base on the edge of the capital

Injured: More than 20 police officers were injured by rocks before the protesters were finally dispersed by officers shooting in the air

'Isn’t this very similar to the end of the First 
World War, when it was said that politicians lied and soldiers died and 
the reality was, as it is now, that our brave soldier lions are being 
led by ministerial donkeys.’

Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former colonel,
 said: ‘I would say totally scale it back so that none of our troops are
 mentoring anyone below battalion level.

‘We’ve had more deaths this year from 
that revolting phrase “green on blue”. It’s called murder, murder by 
people who are meant to be our friends. Enough is enough. We should get 
our troops out as fast as possible.’

Looking ahead: U.S. soldiers from the 4th Brigade, 82nd Airborne arrive to a yard where they will turn in their vehicles and equipment as part of drawdown of 23,000 U.S. troops by Sept. 30

Going to plan: U.S. Army soldiers identify, sort, catalog and prepare for shipping military materiel that is being pulled off the battlefield in Afghanistan
