It's no secret that raising a child is expensive.

But many parents will be shocked to learn just how costly it can be.

After drilling down into the numbers, one New York mother has abandoned any plans to start a family after working out that it could set her back as much as $2million for each little darling.

Expensive business: One New York woman (not pictured) has calculated that it costs nearly $2million to raise a child in the city (image posed by models)

Nadia Taha based her calculations on various outgoings, from childcare to college fees, needed to support a child in the city until the age of 25.

Her verdict? Don't.

Writing in The New York Times, she said: 'Most people want to be sure that they can buy and pay for a home, save up for an emergency fund and enjoy a comfortable retirement.

'My husband and I, both in our late 20s, share those kinds of goals with others like us, but it seems obvious that the single decision that can best help us achieve them is one that many newly married, affluent young adults donâ€™t usually consider - don't have children.'

Painful reading: Among the costs, Nadia Taha factored in health insurance, which she estimated would cost $4,000 per child a year

Mrs Taha, who says they earn slightly
less than the average couple, used figures published by the Department 
of Agriculture (DA) on what families spend on their children as the 
foundation for her calculations, but tailored them to her personal 
situation.

According to the DA, couples in her income bracket in the urban Northeast spend $22,760 to $27,720 per child every year.

But she says it omits other expenses like college and uses a cut-off of 17 years of age.

For basic needs, such as food, transport, clothing and entertainment, she based her maths on the costs of raising children in a two-parent family in the urban Northeast area with a combined income of more than $103,350.

She established that primary child care in New York would set her back between $12,750 to $16,000 then added the cost of schooling from grades 1 to 12.

Adding a dependent to her health insurance would cost $4,000 a year, while saving enough to pay for just half of the college tuition would require a further $5,328 a year.

Writing on the Times' Bucks Blog after her initial article, Mrs Taha also factored in losses of around $700,000 for maternity leave.

Along with other spending, she estimated the total cost to be just shy of $2million.

She said: 'If we were to have a child and do what most other parents do by trying to give this new little life the very best start possible, it would probably cost us $1.8million.'
