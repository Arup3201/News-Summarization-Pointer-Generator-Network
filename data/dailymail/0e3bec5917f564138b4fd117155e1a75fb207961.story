Two policemen were thrown into the air and suffered serious injuries after they were hit by a suspected drunk driver as they spoke to another motorist they had stopped. 

A VW Golf ploughed into the back of Mercedes, which hit the two officers from West Midlands Police who had been standing next to it. The Golf then hurtled into the pair on the A461 in Tipton, Sandwell.

Both were thrown into the air by the crash, with one of the officers knocked unconscious and left with a broken leg while the other was left with serious fractures to both legs. 

Two police officers were thrown up into the air and left with serious leg injuries after a suspected drink driver ploughed into the car they had already stopped in Tipton, Sandwell, before careering into both the officers 

The female driver of the blue Golf has been arrested on suspicion of drink driving. She had to be cut free from the wreckage of the car by firefighters and was taken to hospital with a suspected broken shoulder.

The officers, both in their 40s, had served in the force for 11 and 13 years, and were given emergency first aid by colleagues at the scene in Tipton before specially trained firearms officers arrived.

The crash took place at about 1.30am today.  

Chief Inspector Jack Hadley, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Despite their serious injuries, this crash could have been much worse for all concerned.

'The officers were initially treated by colleagues before firearms officers - who have advanced life-saving skills - arrived to provide major trauma care.

Dudley Port was closed for 4 hours after the crash

'Paramedics then took over sending three ambulances and three doctors to the scene.

'I would urge anyone who may have witnessed the incident and has not yet spoken to police to get in touch.'

The driver of the Mercedes E350, who was initially stopped by the policemen, was not seriously injured.

Dudley Port was closed for four hours while emergency services responded to the crash.
