If you want to brush up on the New Testament while you're on the go, one company has developed a novel solution that fits in your pocket - and on your fingernail too.

The Jerusalem Nano Bible company has developed a tiny version of part of the sacred texts, which can be worn around the neck or even embedded inside a watch.

Measuring less than 0.2 inches (5mm) across, the company is seeking validation from the Guinness World Records that it is indeed the world's smallest Bible - although you'll need a microscope to read it.

The Jerusalem Nano Bible company says they've made the world's smallest Bible (shown). Here it is shown on display at TowerJazz Semiconductor Ltd in Migdal Haemek in northern Israel. The nano-sized New Testament has been nominated for the Guinness World Records as the World's Smallest Bible

On just one face of the square chip, 27 books of the New Testament have been printed.

The tiny biblical text uses the Greek version of the New Testament, Textus Receptus, or 'received text' in Latin.

Each chip is made from a silicon wafer, with their sides measuring a minuscule 0.19 inches (4.76mm).

On the chips, each letter has a width of about 0.18 microns (18 millionths of a metre), so an eight-inch (20.3cm) wafer can apparently contain more than 1,000 Bibles.

An academic scholar validated, with the use of a microscope, that  the text was indeed that of the New Testament.

Teeny Ted from Turnip Town, currently the world's smallest book, is a reproduction of a 30-page tale that fits on a human hair.

The book, which is printed with pure crystalline silicon, cost a staggering $15,000 (around £9,250) to create.

It was written by Malcolm Douglas Chaplin and published by his brother, Robert, at the Simon Fraser University, in British Columbia, Canada.

The book's exact measurements are 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres. Its pages, which are too small to be read even using a microscope, are printed on a single tablet.

The Jerusalem Nano Bible company is now awaiting validation from Guinness World Records of their claim for the world's smallest bible.

The previous record holder, which came into the possession of an Indian scholar, measures 1.1 x 1.3 x 0.39 inches (2.8 x 3.4 x 1.0 cm).

'Our aim is to be able to mass produce it and cater to really every pocket,' said David Almog, head of the company's marketing and sales department.

'Because this application, the smallest Bible in the world, Jerusalem Nano Bible, can be applied to infinite possibilities in the jewellery industry.'

In the future the company is also planning to produce a nano-sized Old Testament.

The company says the tiny bible can be used in jewellery (necklace shown), embedded in watches or any number of other 'infinite possiblites'
