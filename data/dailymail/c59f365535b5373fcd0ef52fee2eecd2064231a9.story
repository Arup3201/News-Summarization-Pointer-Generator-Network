An orphaned bear with life-threatening third-degree burns on her body has made a remarkable recovery and is now set to return to the wild.

Nine-month-old Cinder was found in a driveway in Washington state this summer after getting caught in a blazing wildfire which covered more than 250,000 acres, destroyed 300 homes, killed one person and countless animals.

The burned cub was air-lifted to the Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care rehabilitation center to be nursed back to health and now, three months on, her injuries are healed and she has almost tripled in weight.

Lucky escape: Nine-month-old Cinder was found in a in a driveway in Washington state this summer after getting caught in a blazing wildfire which covered more than 250,000 acres

The worst burns were on Cinder's paws as she walked across the burnt landscape of coals and hot ash.

The infant later tried to alleviate the pain in her feet by crawling on her elbows. She also sustained agonizing burns to her face and chest.

For weeks, vets painstakingly changed the bandages on Cinder's body every other day. Her paw pads had completely burned away leaving the raw pink flesh exposed.

In a bid to get her up to a healthy size, the furry animal was fed a nutritious diet of fresh fruit and fish.

Gradually she went from around 35lbs to 97.5lbs - her current weight.

The care she needs: The 35lb baby bear, nicknamed Cinder, was in agony, with third-degree burns on all four paws and badly scorched sections of her ears, face and body

Bearing up? The cub had limped up a driveway and then took shelter under a horse trailer

Steve Love, who lives in Methow Valley, discovered Cinder in August when he heard his dog barking.

After venturing outside to see what all of the commotion was about he spotted the helpless bear cub hobbling in his driveway.   

Fish and Wildlife responded to the call and managed to capture the 35lb female.

The little bear tried to escape when the officer used his catch pole but was unable due to her injuries. 

The cub was then transferred to Wenatchee, Washington, where state biologist Rich Beausoleil became responsible for her welfare. She was aptly named, Cinder. 

Back to where she belongs: Now that Cinder is healed, vets plan to release her back to her natural habitat

Before and after: Cinder's paw pads had completely burned away leaving raw pink flesh exposed - now the skin has healed over thanks to expert care

Looking for a more permanent home for the brown bear he decide to take her to Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care, a place that helps burned bear cubs rehabilitate.

Pilot Bill Inman of Seattle transported the cub in his small, private airplane.

Now that she is healed, vets plan to release Cinder back to her natural habitat.

She will spend the winter hibernating at a rehab center in Idaho and then come spring, back to the woods of Washington.

The blaze in the Methow Valley in north-central Washington was the largest wildfire in the state's history.
