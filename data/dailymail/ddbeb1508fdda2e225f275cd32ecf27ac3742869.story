The Royal Household last night defended hiring out the ballroom at Buckingham Palace to investment bank  JP Morgan for a lavish dinner hosted by the Duke of York.

The bank paid an undisclosed fee to hire the ballroom and made donations to the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Ballet, which provided entertainment.

Among the 100 guests were banking executives, Tony Blair, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and Indian industrialist Ratan Tata.

A Palace spokeswoman said the event was part of Prince Andrew’s ongoing work to ‘support British prosperity’.

But Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I understand the Palace needs to cut costs and raise money, but dining there should be a privilege rather than being open to the highest bidder. ‘The security implications are also an issue.’

The Household’s relationship with senior corporate figures was previously questioned after St James’s Palace was rented out, apparently at a cost of £30,000 a day, during the London Olympics.

Buckingham Palace said that the State Apartments were occasionally used by outside organisations to generate income to pay for the upkeep of its properties – a recommendation made in a recent parliamentary report.

The event in the ballroom on October 30 was reportedly arranged by a personal friend of Prince Andrew called  David Mayhew, who is one of JP Morgan’s most senior staff.

JP Morgan declined to comment last night but a Palace spokesman said: ‘Events at Buckingham Palace, of which there have been around 200 in the past year, are hosted by members of the Royal Family in conjunction with a variety  of organisations.

‘Re-charging the costs of the event where appropriate is standard practice.’
