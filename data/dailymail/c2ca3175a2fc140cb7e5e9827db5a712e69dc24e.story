Top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin could soon be forced to choose between disgraced husband Anthony Weiner and her job in the coming months.

Weiner’s disastrous bid to become New York mayor reflected badly on everyone associated with his campaign and that includes his wife.

After being very prominent in the early months of Weiner’s campaign, she all but disappeared from view in the wake of revelations that he had continued sexting even after being forced him from public office in 2011.

‘Huma has a choice to make,’ a close associate told New York magazine. 'Does she go with Anthony, or does she go with Hillary?'

If, as anticipated, Hillary Clinton makes a run for the White House in 2016 she will not want to run the risk of having a political liability such as Weiner anywhere near her campaign team.

Abedin is one of Clinton’s most trusted advisers and as a result they supported her decision to help with her husband’s political comeback.

Her political know-how and contacts were credited with making Weiner seem like a credible candidate early in the campaign.

He was even leading in the polls, until in July he was forced to admit he had continued sexting in 2012 using the name ‘Carlos Danger' after Sydney Leathers came forward with evidence. 

Abedin awkwardly stood by her 
man as he made the confession - and even spoke out in favor of him - but she quickly caved in to pressure from the 
Clinton camp.

They feared she - and by extension the Clintons - were being tarnished by Weiner’s actions. In the end she didn’t even accompany him to the polls on election day

The Clinton camp felt it was blindsided by the ‘Carlos Danger’ revelations and Weiner has used up all the chances that they are willing to afford him.

‘Abedin has struggled to reconcile her marriage to Weiner with her role as Clinton’s top aide, traumatized by the prospect of leaving her boss’ inner circle,” the magazine reports, citing a person familiar with the situation.

The candidate’s bird-flipping parting shot to reporters after his humiliating defeat this month made a bad situation even worse, according to New York.
