A relaxed Saturday morning atmosphere reigned at Camp David today as ten of the world's most powerful people huddled in a log cabin in the Appalachian Mountains.

Gone were the ties and furrowed brows of a busy week, cast aside for open-necked shirts and cosy woollens as the likes of David Cameron, Barack Obama and Russia's Dmitri Medvedev sat back amid the idyllic Maryland setting.

Looking at the pictures from today's meeting, it is almost hard to believe these were the leaders of the G8 nations grappling with the problems of soaring oil prices and the eurozone on the brink of collapse.

The Prime Minister and his U.S. counterpart kicked off their weekend in typically sporting fashion, taking to President Obama's gym for a bout of treadmill diplomacy.

The president was said to have called for Mr Cameron at around 7.15am at his cabin - called Maple - at the picturesque retreat.

After a session pounding the treadmills, the two men emerged still deep in conversation. They were seen walking back to the cabins around 7.50am.

Officials attending the summit were coy about which man had been the more athletic performer - instead emphasising the intellectual content of their encounter.

It seems Mr Cameron is not one to let the pressures of running the country get in the way of a little downtime.

A new book describes his leisurely weekend lifestyle, which apparently finds him indulging in the odd frame of snooker, a few glasses of wine with Sunday lunch or even a spot of karaoke.

In the biography, entitled Cameron: Practically a Conservative, a friend says of the PM: 'If there was an Olympic gold medal for ‘chillaxing’, he would win it.'

True to this casual outlook, Mr Cameron met with his fellow world leaders in a grey jumper with a checked collar underneath, while on either side of him, Mr Obama and the Russian Prime Minister Mr Medvedev sported blue, open-necked shirts.

The first working session of the G8 Summit came after officials had worked through the night to find an agreed form of wording on the eurozone issue for the final summit communique.

Following his preparatory talks with Mr Obama, the Prime Minister signalled that the G8 leaders were ready to tackle soaring oil prices.

Mr Cameron said action was needed to protect world economies.

'We are addressing here the two biggest threats to all our economies and that is, of course, the eurozone crisis but also the very high oil prices that translate into high prices at the pumps,' he said.

'We are making progress on both.'

Mr Cameron said the summit - which brings together the leaders of Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia - was an opportunity for the non-eurozone nations to press the currency bloc to resolve its problems.

'Particularly on the eurozone, what is required is a sense of urgency and then clear actions for strong banks, strong deficit reduction plans, strong governance and strong contingency plans for whatever might happen,' he said.

'On all those things I think there's a good sense of talks taking place and a good sense that action needs to follow.

'The G8 can't instruct the eurozone what to do but why meetings like this matter is that eurozone countries can hear from countries outside the eurozone whose economies are affected.

'It's very important these messages get across but I would say there is a growing sense of urgency that action needs to be taken, contingency plans need to be put in place and the strengthening of banks, governance, firewalls, all of those things, need to take place very fast.'

Mr Cameron refused to be drawn into criticising German Chancellor Angela Merkel for blocking a rescue package for the eurozone.

However, he indicated that he would like to see the European Central Bank do more to stimulate demand.

'I think the German chancellor is absolutely right that every country needs to have in place strong plans for dealing with their deficits,' he said.

'Growth and austerity aren't alternatives. You need a deficit reduction plan in order to get growth in order to have the low interest rates that we have in Britain and are vital for the future of our economy.

'But clearly, just as Britain benefits from a strong government with a strong deficit reduction plan and strong banks but also an independent monetary policy giving us low interest rates, helping to push demand in the economy, so the eurozone, I believe, needs that approach as well.'
