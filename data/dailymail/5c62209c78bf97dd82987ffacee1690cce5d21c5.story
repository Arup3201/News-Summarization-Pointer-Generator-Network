The police team searching for 
missing Ben Needham have finished their extensive digging operation on the Greek 
island of Kos - after finding no trace of the missing child.

British officers using specialist search dogs and hi-tech imaging equipment, have drawn a blank following an extensive search and are returning to Britain no closer to finding Ben, who vanished in July 1991.

His  mother Kerry Grist has also flown back to her home in Sheffield following the end of the operation.

Mystery: Ben Needham (left) was just 21 months old when he vanished in July 1991. His mother Kerry Grist (right) has flown back to Britain from the Greek island of Kos following the latest unsuccessful search for him

Co-operation: Greek and British police worked together to search for Ben, but found not trace of him. He would be around 23 years-old now

Mrs Grist admitted she is relieved that the results of the search - which also involved Greek officers - have confirmed her belief that Ben, who would be 23 on Monday, is alive and well somewhere in the world.

She said: 'This needed to be done for everybody’s sake. Obviously I’ve always believed that Ben’s out there somewhere and this has just confirmed it.

'I’ve had to think positively about it. It has been distressing but it's done now so I can move on.

'I’m really not sure what happens now. I
will be having meetings with South Yorkshire Police and it will be down
to them what the next steps are.'

Investigation: British officers search the ground for any sign of Ben using a mechanical digger. They are now due to return to the UK

Painstaking: The latest search focused on a mound of soil and rubble near to where Ben went missing. It was thought the baby may have been covered by rubble during renovation work at the farmhouse

Mrs Grist said that whatever the police choose to do now, she was going to back them 'and support them in their next steps.'

Det
Supt Matt Fenwick, from South Yorkshire Police, led the dig around the 
farmhouse in the hamlet of 
Iraklis that was being renovated when Ben disappeared 21 years ago.

He
said: 'Even after the search we have done you can never say 100 per 
cent, but the search has been so extensive and so thorough it is very 
unlikely that he could be in the specific locations where we have 
searched.”

Ben
was being cared for by his grandparents Eddie and Christine Needham 
when he vanished from outside the farmhouse.

Painstaking: Officers used intricate techniques to search the ground in the area where the youngster went missing

Intensive: British police were granted a permit to carry out the search from the authorities on Kos

One
theory is the toddler was accidentally trapped beneath piles of dirt 
and building material which were being dumped on the plot by a JCB 
digger working nearby.

Detectives
had believed that a small Dinky toy car belonging to Ben could be key 
to discovering his fate.

They used specialist scanning equipment to 
search for signs of buried metal as well as possible human remains.

Local
people in and around the village of Iraklise helped with the operation 
to find the youngster.

Intricate: It was hoped that the search would at least have revealed some clues to Ben's whereabouts - but none was found

At work: Officers used probes - together with more hi-tech equipment - to test the ground in their search for Ben

Authorities on Kos granted a permit for the excavation based on ‘reasonable suspicions’ by British police.

The cost of the operation – certain 
to be a substantial five figure sum – will be paid by British taxpayers.

She is believed to have supported the excavation in order to ‘eliminate speculation’ about an accidental death.

Despite a number of possible sightings 
and a range of theories about what happened to him, no trace of the 
youngster has ever been found.
