Anton Ferdinand has signed for Police United in the Thai Premier League in a bid to revive his career, and says Muangthong United's Jay Bothroyd convinced him to make the switch.

Ferdinand had a sorry time in the Turkish Super Lig last season, making just three appearances for Antalyaspor as they were relegated and six on loan to Bursaspor.

The 29-year-old's career has stalled since leaving QPR in August 2013 after they were relegated to the Championship, but Ferdinand hopes to follow Bothroyd's lead and seize his chance in Thailand.

Ferdinand, the sibling of ex-England
 defender Rio, won 17 caps for England U21 himself, but couldn't reach the same level as his brother.

Nevertheless, he reckons Thai football was the way to go after discussing it with Bothroyd, who left QPR two months before Ferdinand to join Muangthong.

'I don't know much about Thai football,' said Ferdinand, as reported by Bangkok Post.

'But I have talked to Jay Bothroyd. He told me that Thai football had changed a lot over the years with a lot of professional players.

'The weather here will not be a problem for me.

'My parents were born in a hot country (Saint Lucia) and I will be able to adapt to the weather here.'

The signing comes a week after Ferdinand denied a deal was struck with Police United, tweeting: 'For the record I haven't signed for anybody, still have a lot of options to explore. Watch this space... Passport at the ready!'

Police United, nicknamed Insee, have won the Thai Division One three times and finished ninth in the Thai Premier League last year.
