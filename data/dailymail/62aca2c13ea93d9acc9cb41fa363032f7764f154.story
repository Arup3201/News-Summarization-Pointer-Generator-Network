Will.i.am has finally launched his smartwatch, which can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone. 

Two years in the making, the Puls smartwatch boasts an array of apps and GPS and a voice-controlled personal assistant like Siri.

Unveiling the device at Salesforce.com's Dreamforce event in San Francisco, the musician and entrepreneur was keen to stress that his device is not just a watch because watches don’t typically come with SIM cards,TechRadar reported.

Rapper and entrepreneur will.i.am (pictured left) has finally launched his smartwatch (right), which can make phone calls without being linked to a smartphone. It has a curved touch screen and a Sim car reader built into its distinctive cuff design, so fashion-conscious wearers can make phone calls from the wearable device

He joins the likes of Apple and Motorola, who have launched wearables to appeal to the fashion-conscious, rather than the stereotypical tech geek. 

The device includes a SIM card reader next to the battery, which is fitted into the wide wristband, to make phone calls possible. A curved touchscreen is also built into the cuff design.

It has 16GB of memory, 1GB of RAM, speakers, 3G and Wi-Fi connectivity as well as GPS for maps and a pedometer and accelerometer for fitness apps. The watch runs on an Android-based operating system using a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, according to Engadget.

Design: Looks like a cuff that is around two inches wide. It comes in four colours.

Platform: Android-based.

Internals: Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, 16GB memory, 1GB ram.

Phone capabilities: Device has a built-in Sim card reader to make calls and send texts without being connected to a smartphone. AT&T and O2 will offer data plans.

Connectivity: 3G and Wi-Fi.

Apps: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and fitness apps that don't use a heart monitor.

Extras: GPS, a music service, built-in pedometer and accelerometer.

Voice activation: A PA called AneedA, which can be summoned by speech, like Apple's Siri.

Battery life: 5 Hours.

Price and launch date: Not yet announced.

Like Apple’s Siri, Windows’ Cortana and Google Now, the device includes a voice-controlled assistant.

Called AndeedA, it is described as the ‘virtual personality and the soul of Puls’ which can be used with popular apps such as Facebook and Twitter.

Will.i.am said: ‘Puls represents my passion for, and my mission to marry design and advanced technology – to create a new breed of wearable device that leapfrogs what is currently on the market. 

‘…We designed AneedA from the ground up, taking her from an innovative concept to a reality. You speak, she listens. You ask, she delivers. You need something, AneedA’s ready.

‘With you at all times and incredibly capable – AneedA is the perfect virtual personal assistant.’

AneedA  can take dictation to send a text or email, play songs on-demand, post to Facebook, schedule appointments and make calls from voice commands.

While the smartwatch doesn't have a heartbeat sensor like some of its rivals, it apparently detects emotions and can share these ‘vibes’ with others using an app called Vibe. 

A rival for Apple Watch? will.i.am wore his  smartwatch before the launch, and said that people will be able to use the gadget like a phone, by making calls, using apps and listen to music

Like Apple’s Siri, Windows’ Cortana and Google Now, the device includes a voice-controlled assistant. Music can be stored and played on the device (pictured left) as well as being accessible through a streaming service. While the device does not have a heart monitor, it still offers fitness apps (right)

 will.i.am was seen using his watch at a DJ set (pictured) three weeks ago. The device was meant to launch in July, but was delayed

In April, will.i.am claimed that the gadget has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and apps including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in an interview with Alan Carr (pictured)

A built-in music app will allow users to store music locally, as well as use a digital music service from a British company called 7digital.

Will.i.am and 7digital are thought to have struck deals with large and small record labels to cover most musical tastes, which could give the wearable an edge over those with other music services.

Because the Puls is a stand-alone gadget, it requires its own data plan. This will be available from AT&T in the US and from O2 in the UK, although no prices have yet been announced, but will.i.am hinted it will be cheaper than a smartphone and ‘affordable’.

The cuff will come in black, white, pink and blue. 

A backpack with built-in speakers, a jacket that is able to charge devices and shoes with a built-in pedometer  will also be sold alongside the Puls wearable.

Ahead of the launch, Will.i.am was recently seen wearing his Puls creation during a DJ set, where he phoned a friend and told the audience: ‘Just to let you know, this is not tethered to a phone, or nothing like that,’ before seemingly using it to control the music playing.

Music to consumers' ears? The device, runs Android, has a curved screen and can store music locally, as well as coming with a digital music service from a British company called 7digital. This is will.i.am's personal prototype which he wore in public before the launch

The wrapper and entrepreneur was recently seen wearing his creation during a DJ set, where he phoned a friend and told the audience: ‘Just to let you know, this is not tethered to a phone, or nothing like that. He also used it to call Cheryl Cole in the last series of The Voice (pictured)

In April, he claimed in an interview with Alan Carr, that the gadget has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and apps including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, all of which will.i.am uses frequently.

Will.i.am, the director of creative innovation at Intel showed off his smartwatch for the first time on Channel 4's Alan Carr: Chatty Man, as well as using it during The Voice.

During the show, will.i.am told Alan Carr: 'I don’t carry my phone anymore, this is my phone.

‘A lot of these smartwatches need phones - mine doesn't need a phone.

'I started the company myself, I funded it, I used my own money to develop it.

'So, it’s a phone. It has all my music in it so I can work out with it, without wires using Bluetooth headphones. It’s got Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.’

will.i.am's device will go head-to head with the Apple Watch (pictured left and right). It is not known whether the two products will be similarly priced, with an Apple Watch costing  $349 (£216). There is no launch date for either of the watches, with rumours suggesting the Apple Watch will not be released until February

The following night, will.i.am used the watch to call Cheryl Cole during the final of talent show The Voice - although the call quality was poor and cut out shortly afterwards.

Aside from music, Will.i.am has a strong background in science and technology.

In 2011, Intel named will.i.am as director of creative innovation and his role was to help develop the firm’s range of phones, tablets and laptops.

A year later he made history by streaming a song from the surface of Mars in conjunction with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. The song was called Reaching for the Stars.

The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.'

Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen.

Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches.

The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom.

Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch.

Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications.

It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone.

Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them.

There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji.

Siri also is built into the Apple Watch.
