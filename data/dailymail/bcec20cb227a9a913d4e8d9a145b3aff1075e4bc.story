Italy coach Antonio Conte is visiting Chelsea and Tottenham next week on a fact-finding mission ahead of his country's friendly with England.

Conte has scheduled a two-week tour of England, including a trip to Chelsea and plans to take in the Tottenham vs Fiorentina Europa League game on February 19. 

He also intends to take in other Premier League games as he weighs up the players who could figure in Roy Hodgson's squad.

Conte may also spend time at Chelsea's training ground as Jose Mourinho is a former colleague of Italy team manager Gabriele Oriali.

Conte’s Italy face England at Juventus Stadium on March 31, and there has been speculation about his future. 

There were reports that he was furious at having to cancel a national team get-together when clubs indicated they would not release their players from domestic duties.

But the back pages of the Italian papers indicate that he will stay in charge of the side until at least Euro 2016.
