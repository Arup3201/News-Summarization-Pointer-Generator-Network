Killjoy university bosses have threatened students with a £200 fine if they are caught drunk - in a campus bar.

Students at Lancaster University received an email telling them anyone who appeared to be intoxicated would be fined and hauled in front of a disciplinary hearing.

The bizarre ban at the popular Lonsdale 
Bar also says anyone caught getting a pint for someone who is drunk 
could be fined £250 - including bar staff.

But within hours of Friday’s email students packed out the bar to down drinks in protest at the new rules, apparently passed to curb two-for-one drinks offers.

The announcement from Lonsdale College
 administrator Juli Shorrock said: 'Students found in Lonsdale Bar or 
coming out of Lonsdale Bar who appear to be drunk to a porter, college 
officer or assistant dean will be required to identify themselves and 
will be summoned to a disciplinary hearing.'

Lonsdale College issued a statement explaining their decision.

However, the college bar still offered discounted drinks to students that were 'cheaper than pre-drinking'.

Students took to Twitter to defy the new rules.

night’s rebellious carnage in @LonnieCollege bar just shows we are the 
best college on campus #tryfiningusnow'

Lucie Alice added: 'They ban us from drinking so we go to the bar and get drunk #wedowhatwewant'

Student union president Joel Pullan, said he thought the decree was 'damaging.'

He added: 'While LUSU holds no jurisdiction over the college bars we are striving to find out more information on the reasons behind these fines.

'Though we advocate sensible drinking, we feel such policies could damage the college bar system which we, with students have fought so hard to preserve.'

The university has played down the ban and claimes it was a 'one-off campaign' to 'raise awareness of UK law on getting drunk and the potential consequences'.

A spokesperson added: 'The ban was not enforced and the bar operated normally.

'There was a great atmosphere from very early in the evening with large numbers having a great time with their friends and enjoying a drink.

'Lonsdale bar has been praised by the police for being run responsibly and we intend to keep it that way.

'The university only fines students where there is damage to property or persons.'
