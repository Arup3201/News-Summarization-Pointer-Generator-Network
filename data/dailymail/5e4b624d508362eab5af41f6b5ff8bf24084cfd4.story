Sorry: Tana Baumler, 59, was taking her husband and granddaughters, four and seven, to Yellowstone National Park, in Idaho, when she was caught speeding

A grandmother who was caught speeding with her two grandchildren in the car has sent a thank-you letter to the officer who gave her the ticket.

Tana Baumler, 59, was taking her husband and granddaughters, four and seven, to Yellowstone National Park, in Idaho, in early July when she was clocked driving 95mph in a 75mph zone.

State trooper Mike Nielson spotted her car careering along the highway and set off in hot pursuit, pulling her over when he caught up.

But rather than assume the role of the stereotypical 'bad cop', he was the picture of warmth and kindness, according to Mrs Baumler.

So much so that when it came to paying her $150 fine, the restauranteur felt compelled to enclose a little note thanking him for being so nice.

'I was going too fast,' she told ABC News, saying that when he approached her vehicle he went out of his way to put her granddaughters 'at ease', handing them stickers before writing out her ticket.

'They're
 4 and 7,' she went on. 'Sometimes you see the lights and a police 
officer and you're scared, but he came up and talked to them and was 
really nice. He had no attitude. He could have made it a bad day. But he didn't.'

Alongside her cheque, her note read: 'Dear Idaho State Police, Recently I was on vacation with my 
grandchildren and was pulled over for speeding.

'Officer Mike Nielson 
made it a good experience for my grandchildren by talking with them 
calmly and giving them stickers. He didn't leave me out and I got my 
very own STICKER SHOCK :) Thanks for a great attitude.'

At ease: Mike Nielson said he always tries to make children feel at ease saying it can be a little scary for them when 'the guy in the big hat walks up to the car'

Officer Nielson told the channel: 'You usually just talk to the kids - the kids are just inquisitive when the guy in the big hat walks up to the car by the side of the highway and can be a bit nervous.'

Mrs Baumler says running her own restaurant for 26 years had taught her the value of positive feedback.

'When anything bad happens, it's easy to be negative,' she said. 'If someone does a good job, it's always nice to say so.'

Of her grandchildren, she added: 'I told them that you make these choices and that he was just doing his 
job. I made a bad choice, so I [had to] pay the consequences.'

Having told them that, she added, her eldest granddaughter recommended she hire Officer Nielson to work in her restaurant.

Mixed reaction: As news of her story began to spread, it was met with mixed reactions online. Some praised her magnanimity, while others she had been irresponsible driving so fast with children on the back seat

As news of her story began to spread, it was met with mixed reactions online.

On one comment board, 'RB in WV' wrote: 'I love happy news. Airstrikes in Gaza, Ebola spreads, Dow tumbles ... it's nice to have a break from all that.'

But others were less impressed.

Gabriella wrote: 'That was nice, although I don't know if I would have gone through the trouble of sending thank-you note if I got a $150 ticket; however, I wouldn't have been driving 95 in a 75 with kids in the car, either.'

JohnJohnj went a step further. 'The woman is a moron,' he harrumphed. 'To drive like that with her grandchildren is disgraceful. She should be charged with child endangerment.'
