Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October focuses on fundraising for a cure along with providing information about prevention and helping sufferers and their families cope with the disease.

Although it is predominantly women who suffer from breast cancer, it is often overlooked that men can be battling the disease too.

Cecil Herrin was 67 when he was diagnosed with breast cancer - having repeatedly been refused a mammogram by his doctor for the lump that was growing under his nipple.

Battle: Cecil Herrin, 67 survived breast cancer after he was repeatedly told by a doctor that he didn't need a mammogram

In the end, it was his cardiologist who told him that he needed to be tested while he was undergoing a routine check-up.

Mr Herring, from Grovetown, Georgia, was informed that he had breast cancer from the biopsy results.

He told ABC: 'I cried. It hit me so hard. That was the scariest moment in my life.'

He had a mastectomy to remove his breast and was left with scar where his nipple had been removed. He did not have follow-up treatments of radiation or chemotherapy but does take  tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen drug, to ward off the disease.

One in 1,000 men is affected by breast cancer and it mostly occurs in those aged 60-70 years old. One man dies from the disease daily, according to the American Cancer Society.

Although women are regularly encouraged to check their breasts, groups are hoping to raise awareness with men that they may also be at risk.

They have a higher chance of breast cancer if exposed to radiation, have family history or develop high esterogen levels which are linked to cirrhosis or Klinefelter's syndrome.

The most common symptom for men is a lump in the breast area – nearly always painless.

Early signs can also include lumps in the armpit or collarbone area, nipple 
discharge, and puckering, flaking or redness anywhere on the breast.

Other symptoms can include an inverted nipple, oozing from the nipple and an infected open sore.

In terms of removing the cancer, the most common operation for men is the removal of the whole breast. Sometimes the surgeon also removes part of the underlying muscle if it is close to the cancer.

Warnings: Symptoms of breast cancer include a lump on the breast, an inverted nipple, an open infected sore and discharge
