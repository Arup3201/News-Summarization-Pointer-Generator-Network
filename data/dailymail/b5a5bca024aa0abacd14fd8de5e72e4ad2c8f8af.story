A boy of 12 was brutally murdered by a 13-year-old friend following an argument in the basement of an Oklahoma church, the State Medical Examiner ruled. 

Lance Madison died of head and neck injuries due to blunt force trauma after being struck by the killer during a scuffle at the First Baptist Church in Cordell, Oklahoma, on January 11.

His best friend apparently witnessed the fight and told Lance's mom that the boys had been ‘horsing around’.

Touched: Lance's mom, Shantelle, and dad, Brian, said they were overwhelmed by Hook's decision to give them his medal in tribute to their son

She said in an interview with NewsOK that the situation had got out of control and Lane, an avid wrestler, was punched in the face. He hit a wall and fell to the floor unconscious.

The other boy then jumped on top of him and beat him.

As he fell, Lance’s head hit the church basement floor, which had only a thin layer of carpet over concrete. He was taken to Cordell Memorial Hospital where he later died.

A murder investigation was launched following the death of the Cordell Elementary school student. Superintendent Brad Overton told Koco.com: 'when something tragic like this happens in a small community if affects our kids. It's been a rough day.'

Pastor Terrell Romberg of the First Baptist Church of Cordell described Lance's sudden death as a 'terrible, terrible tragedy which has befallen our community' adding that the church was praying for the families of both the young boys involved.

In the days following Lance's death, Noah Hooks, a fellow wrestler from Deer Creek, who was due to face Lance in a fight, gave a winning medal to Lance’s parents in tribute to the youngster.

The family said they were overwhelmed by Hook’s kindness.

‘This kid doing this makes you realise there are very special kids in this world,’ Brian Madison, Lane's father, said.

‘It was the first match since Lane passed, and his little brother said “we're going”. It touched my heart so much that a young man would even think to do such a thing,’ His mother, Shantelle Madison, added.

She said she wants her son’s killer, whose name hasn't been released, to face criminal charges.
