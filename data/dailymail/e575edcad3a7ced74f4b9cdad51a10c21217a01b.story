Hilda Holland, pictured here with husband John, has vowed to never fly again after she was hit on the head by a shoe that fell from a locker

A Thomas Cook plane was forced to make an emergency landing after a pensioner was knocked unconscious by a shoe that fell from an overhead locker.

Hilda Holland, 79, was stretchered off the plane after the freak accident when a fellow passenger opened the locker to take out some warm clothing and the heavy leather suede shoe fell.

The retired gas worker said: 'I blame it on people trying to take too much luggage on the plane because they don't want to pay as much. It was obviously a loose shoe that wasn't in a bag secure and I am lucky I wasn't more seriously injured.

'We won't fly any more. That was a wake-up call for us. It was actually quite embarrassing, knowing that I managed to ground a plane.' 

Passengers are charged to put their luggage into the hold on all Thomas Cook flights.

Prices start from £19 for a 20kg bag on a short-haul flight; for a long haul journey the price is £28.

Mrs Holland was taken from her aisle seat to the front of the plane and treated by two off-duty nurses who happened to be on the Thomas Cook Airbus A321-211.

The plane then made an emergency diversion to Lisbon where she was quickly stretchered off and taken to hospital with her worried husband John, 77, who thought she was going to die.

At the British Hospital Lisbon XXI Mrs Holland was given a CT scan which fortunately showed no permanent damage.

But she was kept overnight for observation before the couple were allowed to return to the airport at 5am the next day.

The retired couple then had to fork out £370 for a flight back to Birmingham International Airport and ended up going via Brussels in Belgium before getting home late on January 11.

Mrs Holland, who lives with her husband in Rowley Regis, in the West Midlands, vowed never to fly again following their 'traumatic' ordeal that happened only 50 minutes into their flight from Fuerteventura to Birmingham.

The pensioner said: 'I was sitting there and had just been talking to a lady sitting by me and all of a sudden I felt a bang on my head.

'The lady behind was pulling woolly clothing out of the overhead locker and with it came a loose shoe.

'My husband came over and asked what had happened and I must have gone into shock because I couldn't speak. The lady said sorry but I couldn't say anything back.

A fellow passenger opened the overhead locker, similar to the one above, to get something out when a shoe fell, hitting Mrs Holland

'I don't remember anything else because I must have gone unconscious but they took me to the front of the plane and curtained it off.

'They got permission to land in Lisbon and took me to the hospital where I had a scan and an injection because I had dehydrated so much. We left the hospital at 5am and got on the plane at 3.30pm and eventually got home about midnight.

'But we've been going on holiday flying abroad for a good many years now so it is a shame we won't be again. We said we will stop in this country now and maybe go on a coach trip. Its not worth the risk. My husband thought he'd lost me.'

Husband John, who used to run a haulage firm, admitted he feared for his wife's life after the freak accident on flight TCX 4125.

Mr and Mrs Holland have said they will never fly again after a shoe hit Mrs Holland causing her to fall seriously ill

He added: 'The woman sitting behind Hilda decided to get a cardigan from the locker but she pulled a shoe out with it. That came down and hit her on the back of the head and the ear. She said to me 'that came sharp'.

'Ten minutes later I looked over and she was shaking and pale. I thought she wasn't going to make it, I had never seen her like that. I've never been so worried in my life.'

The couple's relatives only discovered about their ordeal from police because they didn't have a mobile phone with them.

Their nephew Chris Hill, 50, was left waiting at Birmingham Airport for six-and-a-half hours before eventually giving up and going home.

John added: 'I asked two of the crew if they would phone Chris to let him know about our ordeal but they didn't. He was waiting in the airport for six-and-a-half hours before he eventually found out the plane had been delayed.

'We wanted to go home as quick as we could so we found a travel agent who got us a flight home to Birmingham via Brussels.'

Fellow passengers on the diverted flight said cabin crew had 'panic in their eyes' as news of the emergency landing was relayed.

Megan Clancy, 21, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, said: 'Two of the air stewardesses were serving us drinks.

'All of a sudden a woman came rushing up to the staff saying a lady around ten rows in front of us urgently needed help. Luckily there were two off duty nurses on board who raced to help.

'They started giving her oxygen, then took her to the front of the plane near the cockpit and pulled the curtain across. You could see panic in the eyes of the crew but they remained very calm.

'They reassured all the passengers and checked if anyone needed water.'

The Hollands were returning from a two-week stay at the 4* Hotel Elba Sara in Fuerteventura. 

A spokesperson for Thomas Cook told MailOnline Travel: 'Our Operations Control Centre contacted Mr and Mrs Holland at the hospital and offered assistance within a few hours of their arrival. 

'Mr Holland was grateful for the call and advised that he would make arrangements through his insurers and we ensured he had direct contact number for Thomas Cook. 

'Staff from the airline worked to contact the relatives at Birmingham Airport without success. 

'Our welfare team have been in touch with the Holland's following their return and we hope Mrs Holland makes a full recovery.'
