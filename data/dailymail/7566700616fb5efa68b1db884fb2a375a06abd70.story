A remarkable summer for Caroline Wozniacki continued with yet more drama on Friday night when she was ushered through to the US Open final when her opponent was struck by full body cramps.

The 24 year-old Dane was leading Shuai Peng 7-6, 4-3 when the Chinese player started flexing her leg before becoming unable to walk with severe pain in her legs.

There then followed first an off court medical evaluation, and then a full injury time out, as she was treated for what amounts to a loss of physical condition.

Despite this the rules allowed her to carry on after a ten minute hiatus without any penalty, but four points later Peng crumpled into a heap on court and went into major spasms in her upper body, upon which there was no option but to retire.

A complete re-examination of the regulations can wait for another day as it was, ultimately, unfair on Wozniacki, but the main focus was on the health of Peng, who had to be pushed off in a wheelchair with a doctor in attendance, leaving Wozniacki to understandably muted celebrations of a huge achievement in reaching her second US Open final, where she will face world No 1 Serena Williams.

She said: 'It was really hard to watch for me whenever I saw her collapse on the court. Tennis is great, but health is more important.

'To see her struggling out there, I just wanted to make sure she was okay. I got the word that she's okay now and just getting cooled down, so that's great to hear.

'I know that she had heart surgery when she was 13, so that's definitely something that I think she was worried about, as well.'

Tournament director David Brewer confirmed Peng had recovered well enough to return to the locker room and that the doctor, player and trainer all agreed it would not be physically harmful to her to try to play on.

Wozniacki had her own fitness concerns having been in bed with a cold for the previous two days but said she would 'come out firing' on Sunday.

The Dane was 19 and rocketing to the top of the game when she last reached the final, and it has been a bumpy road to get back.

'I have goose bumps right now,' she said. 'It's been five years since I've been in the final here so it's incredible to be back.'

And so the three months of her life that have unfolded in a way that Wozniacki could never have envisaged may end in extraordinary fashion with her winning the first Grand Slam of her career.

Struggle: Wozniacki feels the heat during semi-final against Peng Shuai

From the slough of despond she fell into after Rory McIlroy broke off their engagement in May she has risen magnificently, all the way to the opportunity for a massive career breakthrough.

Wozniacki arrived in it via a hard fought progression which, before the medical issues arose, was, in keeping with her life of late, much harder than expected. 

The 24 year-old Dane is searching for the first Grand Slam as a professional, despite having twice ended a season as the world No 1 through her overall consistency. 

It was five years ago at Flushing Meadows that she made the final, and there appeared absolutely no prospect of that occurring again back in May, when her personal life was sedate but her on court fortunes seriously on the wane.

As her former fiancée prepared to tee off in Denver Wozniacki walked out onto the Arthur Ashe Stadium in steaming temperatures accompanied by a brisk wind that will have contributed to Peng's eventual demise.

In 37 Grand Slams the 28 year-old Chinese had never reached a semi-final, and prior to this was much better known for her prowess in doubles, which sees her ranked as the world's No 3 player.

Target: Wozniacki has the chance to secure her first Grand Slam title

Yet her surge in form while flying solo had been such that in five matches she had not dropped a set, and had only conceded three service games, even fewer than the likes of Williams.

From the start her flatly hit groundstrokes caused the Dane problems, while the wind was causing trouble with her serve, leading to five double faults in all during the first set.

Twice Wozniacki needed to come back from a break down before romping through the tiebreak 7-1 after Peng had served for it at 6-5.

The second set was also hard fought, and even in her brief return from treatment Peng managed to force a break point to get back to 4-4 before bowing the inevitable, given her rapidly deteriorating physical state.

The incident will be accompanied by calls for more changes to procedures on the WTA Tour, after a similar incident at the Australian Open involving Victoria Azarenka against Sloane Stephens.
