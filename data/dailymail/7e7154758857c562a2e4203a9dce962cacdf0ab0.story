A pensioner has been told her post will not be delivered to her door anymore - because the footpath she uses every day is 'too slippy'.

Enid Sugden, 82, said Royal Mail only told her workers were refusing to deliver to her house after she rang them to say no mail had arrived in weeks.

Royal Mail told her the path was 'hazardous'.

The grandmother-of-five, of Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire, said: 'This house is 300 years old and post has been delivered for most of that time. I’ve lived here 50 years and not had any problems before.

Disgruntled: Enid Sugden stands in front of the path leading to her home that Royal Mail say is too slippery to use. She said it is the first problem she has had in 50 years of living there

'They said the footpath’s slippy. It’s regularly used by locals and there’s not a problem.'

Royal Mail offered to deliver to one of the neighbouring houses but Mrs Sugden refused because she said it would be too much trouble for her neighbours.

Company spokeswoman Felicity McFarlane said the decision was made after a postwoman slipped and injured herself on stepping stones covered in algae and moss six weeks ago.

She said: 'Unfortunately, the narrow road is also in the same condition and hazardous for the same reason. Suspension of delivery is always a last resort for Royal Mail.

'The arrangement is in place where the postman or postwoman will deliver mail when conditions underfoot are dry via the road.We have also offered the customer to have her mail delivered to a nearby address. This offer has not been taken up.'

The news comes as the postal group pledged to take more action against owners of dogs that attack workers.

Following a report published today, Royal Mail said it will actively pursue legal action against the owners of dangerous dogs and take a more 'robust' approach to suspending deliveries to addresses where attacks take place.

Law change: A new independent report says new legislation is needed to target owners of dangerous dogs. Postal workers are attacked by dogs more than 3,000 times a year

Royal Mail said more than 3,000 workers were attacked by dogs in the year to April, although the Communication Workers Union said the true figure was closer to 5,000.

Former High Court judge Sir Gordon Langley's report recommends new legislation be introduced to provide tougher legal sanctions against owners of dangerous dogs.

The independent report pointed out that action cannot be taken if an attack takes place on private property, limiting legal protection available to postmen and women.

New laws have already been introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland, with legislation planned in Wales.

Sir Gordon said the frequency of attacks was a 'matter of real concern' especially as there had been no law change despite a 'general agreement' on the inadequacies of the current law.

Royal Mail chairman Donald Brydon welcomed the report and said: 'Dog attacks cause injuries and terrible trauma to our staff.'
