Manchester United's Spanish contingent of Juan Mata and Ander Herrera combined to produce a pair of skills that should raise fans' spirits after a disappointing start to to their Premier League campaign.

In the promotional video for Adidas, the two recent signings are seen practicing alone on a training pitch before Mata turns to the camera to proclaim: 'This is instinct'.

The former Chelsea playmaker then takes a free-kick - accompanied by some dramatic whooshes from a series of camera angles - from the edge of the penalty area with his countryman facing him at the penalty spot.

The sound of Mata's effort striking the crossbar prompts his partner to 'instinctively' swivel around and volley the rebound into the back of the net before asking the camera: 'Have you got the instinct?'

Hererra, a £28 million summer rival from Athletic Bilbao, has been mooted as a potential successor to Paul Scholes after a series of starring performances on the club's US tour.

Meanwhile, Mata has confirmed that the injury that forced him off United's goalless draw with Barnsley last weekend will not keep him out when the Premier League resumes after the international break.

‘We played at Burnley and we had the need to win the match but once again we just got one point’, he wrote on his blog. ‘We couldn’t score despite we played practically in Burnley’s half after the break.
