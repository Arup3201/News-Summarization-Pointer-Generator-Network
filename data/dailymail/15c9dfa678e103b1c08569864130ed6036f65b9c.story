Search teams looking for two missing airmen from a Turkish jet shot down by Syrian forces have discovered two helmets - but have yet to find the pilots themselves.

The Turkish F4 air force jet was shot down by Syrian authorities over the Mediterranean Sea last week in an act which has escalated tensions between the two countries.

After Syria admitted shooting the plane down for flying 'over Syrian territorial waters', investigators have found two helmets and two pairs of boots in the wreckage, but are yet to recover the pilots dead or alive.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said no parachutes have been found but the flyers' boots were discovered days before.

Experts have speculated that the two pilots could have ejected from the plane after it was hit - but that they would not have survived the wind blast if they did so.

Former fighter pilot and ABC News Consultant Steve Ganyard told ABC the plane which was hit was likely to have been a reconnaissance F-4 Pantom fighter, capable of flying at over twice the speed of sound.

Mr Ganyard told ABC the pilots would have died instantly in the wind blast from ejecting from the plane, or would have been killed on impact when the aircraft hit the water 'as if it were concrete'.

Unclear: Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said there has been no confirmation of what happened to the two pilots

Turkey and Syria continue to argue about what led to the F4 jet being shot out of the sky in the first place.

The Turkish government wrote a letter to the UN earlier this week, claiming the unarmed plane had been flying in international airspace when it suddenly came under fire from Syrian air defenses.

The letter stated that after being hit, the Turkish plane turned into Syrian airspace before crashing.

Turkey has since promised to respond 'determinedly' after the Syrian military admitted shooting down the warplane.

A day after the letter was sent, a top Syrian official told the Syrian State News Agency the aircraft had 'blatantly' violated the country's airspace, adding that the shooting was a defensive and sovereign act.

Jihad Makdessi, a spokesperson for Syria's Foreign and Expatriates Ministry, said the jet had gone deep into Syrian airspace before it triggered an automatic air defense system.

Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week led a two-hour security meeting on the crisis.

In a statement issued after the meeting, the government said it 'will determinedly take necessary steps' in response, without saying what they would be.

It comes after the Syrian military confirmed it had brought down the plane over the eastern part of the sea, southwest of the Turkish province of Hatay, which borders Syria.

'Our air defences confronted a target that penetrated our air space over our territorial waters pre-afternoon on Friday and shot it down,' a statement by the military circulated on state media said.

'It turned out to be a Turkish military plane.'

The incident threatens to worsen relations between the two countries, which have already become strained in recent months.

Turkey has joined nations such as the US in saying that Syrian President Bashar Assad should step down because of the uprising in his country.

Turkey also has set up refugee camps on its border for more than 32,000 Syrians who have fled the fighting.

Erdogan confirmed that the plane went down some eight miles (13km) from the Syrian town of Latakia over the Mediterranean Sea.

He said: 'Four of our gunboats and some Syrian gunboats are carrying out a joint search there.'

Ilter Turan, a professor of political science at Istanbul's Bilgi University, told NTV that Syria's action was clearly 'hostile,' even if it violated its air space.

'They could have either sent their planes to confront it or force it to land, it is a hostile act by any standard,' Turan said.

Turan, however, predicted that Syria will try to avoid escalating tensions further

This latest incident could further threaten relations between the two countries already at bitter odds over a 16-month-old revolt against Assad.

Syria and Turkey have expelled each other's ambassadors and Syria has accused Turkey of supporting Syrian opposition and even allowing Syrian rebels to operate out of Turkish soil.
