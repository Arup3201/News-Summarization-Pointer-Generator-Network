Aaron Ramsey scored one of the goals of the season as Arsenal answered their critics with a 4-1 win at Galatasaray, but boss Arsene Wenger is now focusing on improving their domestic form.

The 23-year-old's sensational 30-yard half-volley - which was so good it was applauded by the home fans and started debates about great goals on social media - made it 3-0 after half an hour as the Gunners put in a commanding display in Istanbul, showing no hangover from the disappointment of Saturday's 3-2 defeat at Stoke.

A lot of the reaction on Twitter focused on Arsenal forward Yaya Sanogo, who just looked flabbergasted after Ramsey's strike went in.

He was very modest in his reaction to his wonder strike after the match, saying: 'The ball came to the edge of the box and I thought, 'why not have a go?

'So I had a go and it went in.'

It was the Wales midfielder's second goal of the match, with Lukas Podolski also scoring twice for the visitors, while Wesley Sneijder clipped home a late 20-yard free-kick as a small consolation for Galatasaray.

The win was a big one for Wenger after he was jeered and subjected to some aggressive personal abuse as the players boarded the train back to London at Stoke after losing at the weekend.

The 65-year-old now has his eyes firmly fixed on remedying their stuttering Premier League form while they wait to find out who they will face in the last 16 of the Champions League next year.

Dortmund's draw against Anderlecht, however, means Arsenal finished second in Group D and so could face the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain or defending champions Bayern Munich when the pairings are made on Monday.

By then, though, Wenger believes Arsenal could themselves be a very different prospect, with several key players set to return from injury in the coming weeks.

'Let's wait for the draw, prepare well. We can focus now on the Premier League,' said Wenger.

'It was my 180th game in Champions League on Tuesday night, we won away from home and now 15 consecutive years in the last 16. That, I believe, is an achievement.

'So let's focus on the Premier League until the end of February and the FA Cup as well, after then we will see where we stand.'

The French coach was pleased with the 'strong response' shown by his team.

'We looked dangerous every time we won the ball back, we had good penetration, we scored good goals and until half-time I feel we were very strong,' he said.

'(In the) second half we suffered a bit more for two reasons - some players had not enough competitive games and especially I had to take two players off.

'We were a bit more lightweight in the second half in midfield.

'We were closer to conceding one or two more in the second half and we defended very well.

'We still had our opportunities but some decisions around the box went against us in the second half, but we tried and overall, it was a strong performance.'

Both Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini were taken off at the break with minor muscle problems, but are expected to be available for Saturday's late afternoon kick-off against Newcastle at the Emirates Stadium.
