Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy signed into law Thursday sweeping new restrictions on weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines similar to the ones used by the man who gunned down 20 child and six educators in the massacre.

Alongside family members of some of the victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Malloy signed the bill hours after the General Assembly approved the measure to give the state some of the toughest gun laws in the country.

'This is a profoundly emotional day for everyone in this room,' the governor said.

'We have come together in a way that few places in the nation have demonstrated the ability to do.'

Emotional: Mark Barden, the father of victim Daniel Barden, cries as he hugs Senator Richard Blumenthal following the signing of the law banning more than 100 weapons

Waiting for action: Relatives of two of the children who were killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting added to the poignancy of the signing of the gun control law on Thursday

In the hours after the shooting 
December 14, as anxious family members gathered inside a firehouse and 
waited for news, Malloy told them their loved ones were not coming home.
He said later that he didn't think it was right for the families to 
wait for the victims to be formally identified.

Now, Connecticut joins states 
including California, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts in having 
the country's strongest gun control laws, said Brian Malte, director of 
mobilization for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence in 
Washington.

'This would put Connecticut right at the top or near the top of the states with the strongest gun laws,' Malte said.

The legislation adds more than 100 
firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials 
have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as 
well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition. Some parts of the bill 
would take effect immediately after Malloy's signature, including 
background checks for all firearms sales.

Support: Now Connecticut is one of the states with the most strict gun control laws in the country

Advocate: Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy has been held up as a leader on the issue of gun control

Heartfelt: Malloy was the one to inform the waiting parents on December 14th that their children had been killed

Following a total of more than 13 
hours of respectful and at times somber debate, the House of 
Representatives and the Senate voted in favor of the 139-page bill 
crafted by leaders from both major parties in the Democratic-controlled 
General Assembly. Both were bipartisan votes.

'I pray today's bill — the most 
far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country — will prevent other 
families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 Sandy Hook
families have felt,' said House Majority Leader Joe Aresimowicz.

Colorado and New York also passed new 
gun control requirements in the wake of the Newtown shooting, in which a
20-year-old gunman used a military-style semi-automatic rifle.

Compared with Connecticut's 
legislation, which, for example, bans the sale or purchase of ammunition
magazines holding more than 10 rounds, New York restricted magazines to
seven bullets and gave owners of higher-capacity magazines a year to 
sell them elsewhere. Colorado banned ammunition magazines that hold more
than 15 rounds.

President Barack Obama has urged lawmakers at the national level to take similar action.

Connecticut House majority leader Joe 
Aresimowicz said of last night's decision: 'I pray today's bill - the 
most far-reaching gun safety legislation in the country - will prevent 
other families from ever experiencing the dreadful loss that the 26 
Sandy Hook families have felt.'

Some of the measures take effect 
right away, including an expansion of the state's assault weapons ban, 
background checks for all firearms sales and a ban on the sale or 
purchase of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds. 

Defining issue: President Barack Obama speaks about gun control at the Denver Police Academy in Colorado yesterday. He is pushing for new nationwide gun controls but faces opposition from powerful groups

The massacre reignited a national 
debate on gun control, and President Obama has made gun safety one of 
the defining issues of his second term, which started a month after the 
shooting.

His proposed gun control measures 
have largely stalled in Congress, however, and Obama has planned a trip 
to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in 
Washington.

Legislative leaders, aware of the attention on them, struck a rare bipartisan agreement they want to serve as a national model.

President Barack Obama has made gun safety one of the defining issues of his second term, which began just a month after the bloody Sandy Hook massacre.

Connecticut is the latest state to introduce stricter gun controls in response to the 26 killings on December 14, joining New York, Massachusetts, California and Colorado.

But Obama's proposed national gun control measures have largely stalled in Congress, however, and the president has planned a trip to Connecticut on Monday to increase pressure on lawmakers in Washington

He visited Colorado yesterday and repeated his call for universal background checks for gun buyers - a measure that has better chances of winning enough support in Congress than an assault weapons ban or limits on large-capacity ammunition magazines.

Obama's visit was heavy with political symbolism because Colorado recently expanded gun control laws despite being a western, largely rural state where gun ownership is a cherished right.

Colorado suffered two of the worst mass shootings in U.S. history - at Columbine school in 1999 and at a movie theater last year. It has expanded background checks for gun purchases and placed restrictions on ammunition magazines.

Obama said Colorado's action shows 'there doesn't have to be a conflict' between keeping citizens safe and protecting the right to bear firearms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.

But the powerful National Rifle Association gun lobby claims more guns keep people safer and have blocked many efforts towards stricter gun controls.

Several county sheriffs in Colorado have also vowed not to enforce the new gun restrictions. 

Senate
President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat, said: 'The tragedy in 
Newtown demands a powerful response, demands a response that transcends 
politics.

'It is the strongest and most comprehensive bill in the country.'

The
bill passed 26-10 in the Senate and 105-44 in the House of 
Representatives. Both were bipartisan votes.

The legislation adds more than 100 
firearms to the state's assault weapons ban and creates what officials 
have called the nation's first dangerous weapon offender registry as 
well as eligibility rules for buying ammunition.

But some lawmakers said they felt the legislation did not do enough to address mental health issues.

Representative Mitch Bolinsky, a freshman Republican lawmaker from Newtown, acknowledged the legislation 'is not perfect' and he hoped would be 'a beginning in addressing critical mental health needs.'

Representative Douglas McCrory, D-Hartford, said he felt the bill 'doesn't speak to the issue of gun violence that has permeated our cities.'

He said families in his district who've lost children to gun violence have not received the same level of attention from state politicians as the Newtown families.

But Senate Minority Leader John McKinney, R-Fairfield, whose district includes Newtown, said he felt he was representing the interests of the Sandy Hook victims as he cast his vote.

'I stand here as their voice, as their elected representative,' he said, reciting the names of the 26 victims at the school.

Lawmakers appeared to still be stunned by the enormity of the massacre.

'When
a child is sent to school, their parents expect them to be safe. The 
Sandy Hook shooting rampage was a parent's, a school system's, a 
community's and the nation's worst nightmare,' said Republican state 
Sen. Toni Boucher of Wilton.

Gun rights advocates, who greatly 
outnumbered gun control supporters in demonstrations held earlier in the
day at the Capitol, railed against the proposals as misguided and 
unconstitutional.

'No! No! No!' and 'Read the bill!' they chanted.

'We want them to write laws that are sensible,' said Ron Pariseau, of Pomfret, who was angry he'll be made a felon if he doesn't register his weapons that will no longer be sold in Connecticut.

'What they're proposing will not stop anything.'

By the time the Senate voted around 6.30pm, many of the gun rights advocates had gone home, leaving behind proponents of the bill who applauded when the tally in the Senate was read.

The halls were mostly empty by the time the House voted at 2.26am this morning.

Among the gun control advocates were Dan and Lauren Garrett, of Hamden, wearing green shirts in honor of the Sandy Hook victims.

The Garretts traveled to Hartford with their 10-month-old son, Robert, to watch the bill's passage. They said they hope lawmakers will build on the proposal.

'It's just the beginning of this bill. In six months from now, it's going to get stronger and stronger,' Dan Garrett said. 'I think they're watching us all over the country.'
