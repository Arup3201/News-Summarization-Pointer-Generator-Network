'Great guy': Former Chargers teammates say Oliver was 'the happiest guy ever'

Oliver played for the Chargers from 2007 to 2011.His teammate, Quentin Jammer, now with the Denver Broncos, said Oliver was not the ‘type of guy’ to commit suicide.

‘He was a good friend of mine. Great guy, great guy,’ Jammer told USA Today Sports.

He said he had not spoken to Oliver in a while.

‘I wish now I could reach out to him. If I'd have known…’ Jammer said.

Oliver played with the Chargers until the 2011 off season, but then was re-signed later that year because of injuries to other players.He also spent time with the New Orleans Saints.

Chargers free safety Eric Weddle said he was ‘devastated’.

‘Words can't really express how as an ex-teammate — I was with him for five years — you have so many memories and so many thoughts.’

The Chargers selected Oliver in the fourth round of the 2007 supplemental draft, and he played in 57 games, with 12 starts. He became a free agent in 2012.

An official statement from the team said: 'Everyone in the Chargers family is sad today after hearing the news about Paul. He was part of our family for five years. At just 29 years old, he had a lifetime in front of him.'

Oliver was a star cornerback for the University of Georgia, where he had seven interceptions, 114 tackles and three sacks during his three seasons in Athens.

He turned pro and entered the supplemental draft after he was ruled academically ineligible before the 2007 season.

Georgia coach Mark Richt described Oliver's death as 'heartbreaking', according to USA Today.

'I was crushed this morning when I heard it, quite frankly,' Richt said.

'I haven' t been able to keep it off my mind, to be honest with you. We have to find a way to reach out and help any way we can.'

Oliver, who is a native of Kennesaw, Georgia, and a graduate of Harrison High School, played with  the Bulldogs during the 2004-06 seasons.

His death comes a year after another Chargers player committed suicide.

Hall of Fame linebacker Junior Seau, who played 20 seasons in the NFL, shot himself in the chest at age 43.

Self-inflicted gunshot: Kenny McKinley, 23, of the Denver Broncos killed himself in 2009

A study of Seau's brain revealed he had suffered from a chronic degenerative brain disease.

It is also another tragedy for the Cobb County football community.

Kenny McKinley, the former Denver Broncos wide receiver from Mableton, Georgia, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2009 at the age of 23.

According to Weddle, Oliver was the 'happiest guy ever. Just a joy to be around. Funny. Charismatic. Worked his tail off. Also quiet, reserved, at the same time. Just a great teammate and great friend.'

Oliver is survived by his wife, Chelsea Young, and two children. Funeral arrangements have not been finalised.
