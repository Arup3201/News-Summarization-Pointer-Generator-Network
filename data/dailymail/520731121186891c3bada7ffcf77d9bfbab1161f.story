Overnight, it has become a tourist sensation.

And since it’s attached to the most popular ticketed visitor attraction in Britain, the crowds are just going to keep on getting bigger — as, indeed, is this stupendous piece of art.

For Paul Cummins, the acclaimed ceramic artist, has barely completed 15 per cent of his poppy invasion of the Tower of London.

Ahead of yesterday’s royal opening of the project, he had installed 120,000 hand-made flowers.

These are stunning enough as it is, filling one side of the Tower’s mighty moat with cascading ripples of red.

Stupendous: The tribute at the Tower of London, with each poppy representing a British or Colonial serviceman who died in World War I

Royal visit: The Duchess of Cambridge places a ceramic poppy, watched by her husband Prince William, and Lord Dannatt, Constable of the Tower of London

Overwhelmed: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry and General Lord Dannatt pause to take in the sheer scale of the display

Work of wonder: Every poppy head was hand made, baked and glazed before the 2ft long stems were welded to them 

Come November 11, Armistice Day, there will be no less than 888,246 of them.

That is one for each of the British and Colonial soldiers, sailors and airmen who perished in the Great War.

By then, all four sides of William the Conqueror’s great fortress will be surrounded by a sea of scarlet (raising millions for charity in the process).

By then, too, the capital will have grown rather attached to a powerful little event which began yesterday and will take place every nightfall between now and Armistice Day.

As dusk falls, the names of 180 war dead — each one nominated by families and members of the public — will be read out.

A different speaker will be invited each night, standing amid the poppies on the same grassy mound where new City of London recruits were sworn in during the war.

Poppy appeal: Artist Paul Cummins planned the project for 888,246 ceramic flowers to be planted at the Tower of London and all will be sold to raise millions for charity

Precision: Clay is sliced by hand and rolled into large flat sheets and a metal stamp, much like a large biscuit cutter, carves out petal patterns and are paired together by hand to form six overlapping petals

Hand crafted: This is one of the 35 artists who hand made the beautiful poppies now being planted at the Tower

Process: The leaves of the poppy were cut from clay using a stamp and later the red glaze was added and baked on in a kiln

Last night it was the actor Tim Pigott-Smith.

With echoes of the nightly bugle call 
at the Menin Gate in Flanders — a profoundly moving ritual which draws 
ever-larger crowds — the scheme has already been inundated with online 
nominations.

Once informed that an ancestor will be on the list on a given evening, entire families are expected to attend.

‘Our biggest challenge is the sheer scale of the thing,’ says the Tower’s head of operations and Deputy Governor, John Brown.

A former Colonel in the Royal Logistic
 Corps, he is used to big projects (he handled the military logistics 
for the last royal wedding).

This idea represents a fusion of two notable British talents: creative flair and military planning.

Each week between now and November, 
55,000 of these poppies must be manufactured before being assembled and planted by an army of 
volunteers. Cummins was supported by trainee ceramicists from Johnson Tiles in Tunstall using clay provided by Potclays, also on Stoke-on-Trent.

Powerful: The Tower was turned blood red and the shadows of men walking to war were shown in a moving ceremony

Grand opening: Tim Pigott-Smith at the unveiling of the  Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red artwork by Paul Cummins where images were beamed onto the Tower of London yesterday evening

Col Brown has been astonished by the numbers queuing to help.

Some 8,000 volunteers have signed up, 
including a group of Americans living in Richmond-upon-Thames and a lady
 who flew from Edinburgh to take part.

Since the project is in the Tower’s 
public precincts and free of charge — with free on-site wi-fi to explain
 it all — the crowds have already caught on.

Yesterday, I found plenty of City 
suits among the T-shirt-and-shorts brigade lining the walkways 
overlooking the site as it was opened by the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge and Prince Harry, accompanied by General Lord Dannatt, former 
head of the Army and now Constable of the Tower of London.

At the Tower’s north-west corner, a 
great shower of poppies pours forth from a window in Legge’s Mount, a 
bastion named after the founder of the Royal Fusiliers.

It’s actually a Yeoman Warder’s kitchen window (a distinguished old soldier, he is, by all accounts, thrilled to be involved).

Royal approval: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince unveiled Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red in London, telling the artist they thought it was incredible

Production line: After being cut out circular 
petals are placed on top of eachother before they are crimped together 
by hand at Mr Cummins' Derby workshop

Things
 of beauty: The ceramic flowers will be at the Tower of London for 
several more months before being sent to the homes of those who have 
bought them for £25

Process: The petals are individually moulded to create the shape of the flower and fired to fix their position. The bright red glaze is applied to the fired poppies before they are returned to the kiln for the second and final firing

Installations:
 The parts designed to swoop through windows, over walls and along the 
ground were created in Plymouth before being brought to London

At the south-west corner, a great wave
 of poppies is surging over the causeway through which three million 
tourists enter the Tower each year.

The broad layout of the poppies has all been planned by theatrical designer Tom Piper of the Royal Shakespeare Company.

‘As a military man, I obviously have 
the temptation to make it all look very neat and tidy but that would 
look like a cemetery,’ says Col Brown.

‘The whole idea is to let it flow. This is a dynamic thing which will grow and grow and then, suddenly, go away.’

For this is not a garden of 
remembrance. Rather, it is a piece of art to encourage reflection rather
 than solemnity — and to raise funds for a broad range of Forces’ 
charities.

Members of the public can buy one of 
these poppies — each the size of a grapefruit, hand-sculpted and fixed 
to a 2ft metal stalk — for £25.

After November 11, each one will be removed from the moat, washed and sent to its owner with a certificate.

Months
 of work: The poppies are still being planted across the Tower and the 
full display will not be completed until Armistice Day this year

Work of art: Each poppy takes three days of work to complete and the 888,000 needed are not yet finished

Design: As well as using ceramic poppies, its creators used the Tower of London and its grounds to form part of the artwork

Determined to contribute something to the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War, Paul Cummins only put his idea to the Tower’s custodians, Historic Royal Palaces, last October.

The trustees then created a community investment company to handle poppy sales.

Production costs, which include two firings of every clay poppy petal, are not cheap (and could touch £8 million).

But 10 per cent of every poppy sold 
goes straight to charities including Help for Heroes, the Royal British 
Legion and Coming Home.

And once all the costs are covered, 
the entire surplus will be distributed. With a potential income of £22.2
 million, it could be a very substantial sum.

This is a remarkable and highly 
original addition to Britain’s commemorative landscape. It is also a 
temporary one. Catch it while you can.

Charities you will support: Confederation of Service Charities, Combat Stress, Coming Home, the Royal British Legion, SSAFA (Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association) and Help for Heroes.
