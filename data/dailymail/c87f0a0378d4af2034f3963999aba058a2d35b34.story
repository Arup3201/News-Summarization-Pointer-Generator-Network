Stuart McCall admits taking on the challenge of steering Rangers to Premiership promotion was a gamble he couldn’t refuse as he bids to earn a longer stay as Ibrox boss.

The 50-year-old was unveiled on Thursday as manager until the end of the current season – following the exit of caretaker Kenny McDowall - and hasn’t received any promises about what could lie beyond that point.

However, the former Rangers midfielder insists he didn’t think twice about returning to the club where he won six league titles in seven years during the 1990s.

McCall views it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and is focused on revitalising a play-off push that could convince the new Rangers board he is the man for the future.

‘I know what the expectation levels are at this club,’ he said. ‘It’s a gamble, it’s a massive challenge but it’s an opportunity I never thought I’d get and I had to take it.

‘It’s an honour and a privilege to be asked to come and help out at this club until the end of the season.

‘People have been texting me good luck and asking me if I know what I’m doing. But it’s a wonderful opportunity for me.’

McCall addressed the players and conducted an afternoon training session at Murray Park after cancelling their scheduled day off.

He spoke with director John Gilligan and interim chairman Paul Murray to reach an agreement on Wednesday but confirmed no guarantees were given beyond the 11 remaining games of the regular season.

‘There’s nothing concrete,’ said the former Motherwell boss, who will again be assisted by Kenny Black. ‘My question to the board was: “What do you see as success?”

‘I don’t want to do as well as I can, turn it around, and then see others coming in.

‘Progress will obviously be an upturn in results and everyone will say success is gaining promotion to the Premiership. But you could get to the second leg of the play-off final, see your goalkeeper sent off and lose on penalty kicks.

‘It can be a thin line between whether you go up or not. We’ve got to improve our performance and it’s about self-belief and regaining confidence. There are no guarantees either way if we go up or have to stay down.

‘I want to make it a success. I’m not an over-confident person. I know it will be a struggle but I will do my best.’

McCall also confirmed he would not have taken the job had Dave King and his allies not attained boardroom power.

‘I get paid to try and get the best out of a group of players,’ he added. ‘There is no magic formula or a pill you can give them for confidence. It’s about trying to restore self-belief. A couple of results can change things.

‘The supporters are there, willing them to do well. They don’t want to come and boo. The club has had a kicking, but the team have had two promotions in the past two seasons and there is still an opportunity to get another one this year.’

McCall spoke at length with McDowall on Thursday morning, before the latter’s amicable departure was then confirmed later in the day.

McDowall became caretaker manager after Ally McCoist was placed on garden leave by the old regime just before Christmas. He was, however, always a reluctant conscript to the role and had handed in his own notice in January.

‘It was an honour and privilege to work for Rangers Football Club and I will leave with so many positive memories,’ said McDowall, who originally arrived at Ibrox as first-team coach in 2007.

‘I have worked with so many talented people since I joined and I will forever be in Walter Smith’s debt for bringing me to Rangers.

‘Working with Walter, Ally McCoist, Ian Durrant, Jim Stewart and all the backroom staff plus the staff at Ibrox and Murray Park was a pleasure and I wish the club well for the future.

‘I was delighted to play a part in the club’s history and I wish the supporters and new management team all the very best.’
