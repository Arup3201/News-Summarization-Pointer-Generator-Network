England have just missed out on a place among the top seeds for next summer's World Cup despite making a considerable leap in the latest FIFA rankings.

Roy Hodgson's team qualified for the tournament this week by finishing top of their group and have jumped seven places in the rankings to 10th, but it is not enough for them to make pot one for the finals draw on December 6.

Hosts Brazil, who are 11th in the rankings, are automatically seeded, while Spain (first), Germany (second), Argentina (third), Colombia (fourth), Belgium (fifth) and Switzerland (seventh) are also definitely in the top pot.

Uruguay (sixth) will be the other seeded side if they beat Jordan in a two-legged play-off, but if the South Americans lose, the last seeding place will go to Holland, who are joint-eighth in the rankings with Italy.

The Italians will be sourly disappointed not to have made pot one, having failed to lose a game in an impressive qualifying campaign.

The Swiss, who also completed their World Cup qualifying group unbeaten to reach the finals for the third time in a row, leaped seven places thanks to their wins over Albania and Slovenia this month.

Italy had been fourth but paid dearly for drawing 2-2 at home to Armenia on Tuesday.

England might have been placed 
higher, but Poland and Ukraine were ranked low because they hosted the European Championships in 2012.

FIFA previously ruled that Brazil (ranked 11th on Thursday) plus the top seven ranked teams would be seeded for the draw at the Costa da Sauipe tropical beach resort in December.

Portugal, Greece, Croatia and Ukraine will be the seeded teams in next Monday's draw for the European zone playoff round, which also features France, Iceland, Sweden and Romania.

Rankings leaders Spain, the reigning 
world champions, are the only non-movers in the top 10, while Germany 
have replaced Argentina in second place and Italy have fallen four 
positions.

Big guns: England could face top seeds Argentina in their group after the South Americans' campaign

Ones to avoid: Hosts Brazil are also among the top seeds on their own turf

Portugal could draw fellow European giants France in the World Cup draw after the two teams were put into separate pots.

Pot one: Portugal, Greece, Croatia, Ukraine

Pot two: France, Iceland, Sweden, Romania

The draw for the two-legged play-offs will take place on Monday

Meanwhile, England manager Roy Hodgson clearly does not mind if his team goes under the radar in Brazil, and will use the shock European Championship triumphs of Greece and Denmark as evidence that the team should not give up on their World Cup dream.

'It's pretty obvious we're not favourites,' said Hodgson.

'The main contenders are Brazil, Argentina, Spain and Germany I guess.

'Is it possible for a European team to win in Brazil? They haven't done yet but anything is possible isn't it?

'No one thought Greece would win the Euros in Portugal (in 2004) or for Denmark to get their players off the beach in 92, but they did.

'Every year it gets that little bit harder to look beyond the favourites but I am pretty sure all the European teams will be hoping to become the first one to reverse the trend.

'We will go with the same attitude.'
