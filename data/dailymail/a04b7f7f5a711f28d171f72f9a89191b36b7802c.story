This is the shocking moment a road sweeper crashed into a parked car and dragged it down the street - before driving off.

The distinctive bright yellow vehicle can be seen colliding with a VW Golf, before leaving the scene.

Video shows how the driver attempted, unsuccessfully, to squeeze through a tight gap on a road in Blackburn, Lancashire.

The owner of the car is now 'fuming' after the incident occurred while she was visiting a sick relative

The footage, caught on CCTV, shows the yellow Charlton Sweeper Hire vehicle striking the stationary Volkswagen Golf, shunting it a short distance before appearing to slow down briefly - and then disappearing down the street.

Seconds later, shocked passers-by arrive and point to the damage on the parked car.

The daughter of the woman who owns the Golf, which was parked on Coniston Road, said she was 'fuming' that it might now have to be written off.

The 31-year-old mother-of-one, who is seven months pregnant, said she had been visiting a sick relative when the crash happened.

She said: 'I just kept watching the CCTV over and over again. I just could not believe it.

'By the time the sweeper had finished with my car, one of the wheels was on the pavement.

Shocking: Moments after the crash passers-by arrived at the scene and pointed out the damage. The vehicle may now be written off and police have launched an investigation

'I am really upset and annoyed. The sweeper didn't just sweep the road, it swept up our car too.'

The motorist's insurance company has been assessing the damage, although she has been told the car could have to be written off because when the car was dragged, the suspension was damaged. 

Police say they received reports that 'several vehicles' had been damaged on the street. An investigation is now underway.

A spokesman for Charlton Sweeper Hire, in Bolton, said: 'I have been in contact with the police and it is being dealt with by the police.'

A spokeswoman for Lancashire Police said: 'We got a call to Coniston Road following the report of a damage only road traffic collision.

'The informant reported a truck had driven down the road and damaged several vehicles in the street.

'The truck had a logo on it saying Charlton Sweeper Hire.'
