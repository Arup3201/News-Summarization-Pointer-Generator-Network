Bowe Bergdahl has thanked President Obama for saving his life - as his newly-appointed military justice lawyer insists the former POW is 'proud' to be back in uniform.

The 28-year-old soldier hired Eugene Fidell to represent him and speak on his behalf six weeks after the Taliban handed him back to the U.S. in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees.

'Sergeant Bergdahl is deeply grateful to
 President Obama for saving his life,'
Fidell, a Yale Law School professor who is working pro bono, told The Daily Beast on Wednesday.

Fidell also appeared on the Today show on Thursday to defend his client, insisting that he was proud to be serving the U.S., despite earlier correspondence that showed him slating his nation.

Speaking out: Eugene Fidell, who is representing former POW Bowe Bergdahl, said on the Today show that his client is proud to be back in uniform after being held captive by the Taliban for five years

Representation: Speaking to Matt Lauer, left, Fidell said he thinks his client had become a 'punching bag' for people who hated the thought of anyone getting released from Guantanamo Bay

'I believe he is [proud],' Fidell said. 'He's back to duty.'

Bergdahl has been assigned an office 
job at U.S. Army North at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston, having completed a 
reintegration and therapy process at the medical facility there.

But when Today host Matt Lauer pushed Fidell on whether his client was going to stay in the Army, Fidell he: 'I think he's ready for the next chapter.' He did not provide further details.

Fidell met personally with Bergdahl last
 week at the base. Bergdahl also has an Army lawyer 
representing him and the two lawyers will work together, Fidell said.

'I think it's important that people, 
particularly people who have been vilified, have proper representation, 
and every lawyer has a responsibility to represent even unpopular 
clients and that's why I'm involved in this,' Fidell told ABC News.

He added on the Today show that he believed Bergdahl's case could have become a 'punching bag' for people who have 'consternation' for people being released from Guantanamo Bay.

Bergdahl was released back to the U.S. in May and swapped with five Guantanamo Bay detainees. He is now back living in regular Army housing with fellow soldiers.

Fidell 
refused to say whether he had been in contact with Bergdahl's parents, Bob and Jani,
whom the former POW has declined to speak to since his return, according
 to defense officials.

Fidell
 said Major General Kenneth Dahl, who is heading the investigation into 
the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's disappearance from his outpost 
in Afghanistan, had not yet interviewed his client.

He said he didn't expect Dahl to have any substantive interviews with Bergdahl for a couple of weeks.

Bergdahl has not been charged with any crimes.

Questions: This photo of Bergdahl smiling with Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani was posted on Twitter and raised more questions about if he had been mistreated during his captivity

In a 
statement, the Army said that the soldier 'has completed the final phase
 of the reintegration process under the control of U.S. Army South and 
is currently being assigned to U.S. Army North, Joint Base San 
Antonio-Fort Sam Houston (JBSA).'

'He
 will now return to regular duty within the command where he can 
contribute to the mission. The Army investigation into the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the disappearance and capture of Bergdahl is 
still ongoing.'

Fox reported that Bergdahl may also receive 
$350,000 from the US government without paying taxes: $200,000 would be 
for wages earned during his captivity and $150,000 if he in fact was a POW.

When he was swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees on May 31, Obama said the switch had been prompted by Bergdahl's poor health.

But his
 former comrades have insisted he abandoned his post - putting others in
 danger - and last week, on a Twitter account associated with the 
Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, a user said Bergdahl had been treated 
with kindness by his captors.
