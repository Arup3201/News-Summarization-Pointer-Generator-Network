A thug who bit a Tesco worker's hand and fought with staff after jumping the queue during 'Black Friday' sales has been jailed for four months.

Michael Anthony Dowd, 28, pleaded guilty after threatening to smash a female assistant's face in and then turning to punch a male member of staff.

He was wrestled to the ground, but continued to kick out and then bit the hand of one of the staff members who kept him restrained until police arrived at the store in Salford, Greater Manchester.

The 22-year-old had previous convictions for violence in 2012 and 2013 and was described as 'not quite right' by Tesco staff who restrained him at the sore in Fairhills, Irlam.

Dowd repeatedly claimed he had no recollection of what he had done and the Manchester Magistrates Court heard he had been intoxicated during the incident on November 28 last year.

He pleaded guilty to assault and using threatening or abusive words and behaviour at an earlier hearing.

Defence attorney Abigail Henry told the court her client had been drunk at the time of the incident and had since referred himself for help for his alcohol abuse.

But District Judge Mark Hadfield told Dowd he had no option but to jail him because he had broken the terms of two previous suspended sentences for violence in the last three years.

Sentencing Dowd to 16 weeks in prison, he told him: 'You were spoken to because a member of staff thought you were trying to queue jump.

'You responded in a manner wholly unacceptable. When a member of staff tried to intervene he was punched for his trouble.

'You have previous convictions for violent offences with suspended sentences in 2012 and 2013 and you breached both these offences.' 

Stores across Britain were left looking like battlefields as shoppers fought to get the best bargains on Black Friday - the busiest shopping day of the year.

One Tesco branch in Manchester had to be closed just 36 minutes after opening due to fighting. 

Two other customers were arrested for public order offences by officers in Manchester, who dealt with some of the worst scenes of violence on the biggest day of discount shopping in the year.

There were also reports of staff being left in tears in Cardiff, while another female staff member was apparently given a black eye following a melee in Stretford.
