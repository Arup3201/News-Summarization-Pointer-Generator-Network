Women aged 40 to 59 have the highest rate of depression of any group in the US, with one in eight admitting they have suffered from the condition

Depression is most common among middle-aged women, with one in eight admitting they have suffered from the condition, health officials said.

Women aged 40 to 59 have the highest rate of depression of any group in the US, but only one third of sufferers sought help from a health professional, according to the report.

Researchers from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics (CDC) found 9.5 per cent of females and 5.6 per cent of males aged 12 and older had moderate or severe depression.

The report also found that 15 per cent of people living in poverty had depression, meaning they were more than twice as likely to have the condition.

Laura Pratt, a CDC epidemiologist who led the study, said: 'Not enough people are getting appropriate treatment for depression.

'People with severe depression should be getting psychotherapy. Some might need complicated medication regimens, which psychiatrists are better equipped to do, which makes it even more concerning that only 35 percent of people with severe depression have seen a mental health professional,' she said.

Depression is a serious medical condition that can affect people's mood and their cognitive functions, such as concentration and decision-making abilities, and even their physical well-being.

Almost 8 per cent of Americans aged 12 and older were moderately to severely depressed during 2009 to 2012, when the research took place. 

The rate of depression increased with age, with 5.7 per cent of youth ages 12 to 17 reporting symptoms, but 9.8 percent of adults aged 40 to 59 saying they have the condition.

Pensioners and those aged over 60 had a lower rate of than other age groups, with 5.4 per cent saying they suffered with depression.

Researchers evaluated whether participants had depression by conducting in-person interviews and asking about their symptoms.

In the study, nearly 90 per cent of people with severe depressive symptoms reported having difficulty at home, with work or in their social activities. 

Almost half of the people who had mild depression reported having the same difficulties. 

Simon Rego, director of psychology training at Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, was disappointed with the numbers seeking treatment.

'Much of the information is not new or surprising,' he said. 'What's disappointing, however, is the fact that the rates of treatment have remained so low.'

'This is a problem because more severe depression leads to more serious difficulties in work, home and social activities, and people rarely experience remission without treatment. 

'Even for those who manage to recover naturally, we know that the risk of recurrence is higher if mild symptoms remain during the remission and the last episode was severe. 

'Clearly much more work needs to be done to educate the public on the symptoms of depression, the major impact it can have on one's functioning, and the benefits of seeking an appropriately trained mental health professional.' 

The symptoms of depression can be complex and vary widely between people. 

But as a general rule, if you are depressed, you feel sad, hopeless and lose interest in things you used to enjoy.
