America has been told to stop flooding its economy with cheap credit - by China.

Chinese commentators preparing for Vice President Joseph Biden's visit to their country have warned the U.S. against the quantitative easing policy being used by its Federal Reserve.

They fear that a massive injection of money into the economy will not push down interest rates.

Arrival: Vice President Joseph Biden and his granddaughter Naomi are in China to talk about its relationship with the U.S.

Instead they fear it will boost the prices of commodities traded in dollars, fuel inflation and erode the value of the $1.2 trillion China owns in U.S. Treasury debt.

Xiao Gang, chairman of state-owned Bank of China, wrote in China Daily: 'The U.S. should refrain from launching QE3 (a third round of bond-buying by the Federal Reserve) and tighten its monetary policy to raise the world's confidence in the dollar.'

The official Xinhua News Agency added: 'China has much at stake over U.S. economic policy changes and a stable U.S. dollar.'

And economist Xia Bin, who advises China's cabinet and central bank, wrote on his blog: 'The United States has entered a long period of decline.'

Biden arrived in Beijing today to talk about, amongst other things, cutting government budget deficits and fighting poverty.

He will also talk to Vice President Xi Jinping, who is expected to take over as Communist Party chief in 2012 and will visit Washington later this year.

And his aides expect him to have to answer questions on Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims and which Washington provides arms to.

But the sub-text for the five-day visit is Chinese worries about the U.S. economy.

While the advice being handed out by Chinese economists is similar to that from Western analysts, it has been remarked that they are being unusually pointed.

This is because, in China, communist leaders frequently say governments should stay out of each others' affairs.

They have also said that resolving economic problems in a 'responsible manner' would improve U.S.- Chinese relations.

China's own government debt is low compared with those of the U.S., Japan and European countries.

This is even after a huge stimulus that helped it rebound quickly from the 2008 global crisis.

The press campaign might also help Beijing diffuse criticism it faces on its decision to invest so much of its $3.2 trillion in foreign reserves in Treasury debt.

Treasurys are seen as one of the lowest-risk assets but the recent debate in Washington over raising the government debt limit and downgrade of the U.S. credit rating caused alarm in China.

Capital Economics analyst Mark Williams said: 'By focusing concern on the failures of U.S. policy making, as China sees it, Chinese officials are able to deflect attention from their own part in creating some of the global imbalances and the decision that lay entirely in their hands to invest so much in U.S. Treasurys.'
