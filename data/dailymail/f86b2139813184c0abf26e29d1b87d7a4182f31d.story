Cats are never around when you want them most.

They're often out prowling and hunting and climbing, and seldom come when you call.

But sometimes they right in front of your eyes and you have no idea, as one woman, who called herself Ms. Wallace on online noticeboard Reddit, has discovered. 

Clancy? Come out: Ms Wallace spent a good 10 minutes searching for her pet. So where is Clancy? 

She said she spent 10 minutes searching her house for her cat, whose name is Clancy.

She went outside, did a sweep of the living room and bedrooms, but nothing.

It was only on the second look in the living room - where there are plenty of hiding spots - did she realize where her pet actually was.

Can you find Clancy? 

There you are: Ms Wallace said the cat, who has bright yellow eyes, was sleeping sitting up and she couldn't see him sitting right in front of her

Stealth: Of the hiding spots in the room, Clancy didn't need one
