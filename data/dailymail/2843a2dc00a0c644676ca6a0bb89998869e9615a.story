Inventor: An Peishi, a university lecturer from Sichuan, is the inventor of 'panda tea'

China is embracing the harvest season of possibly the world's most expensive and bizarre tea.

Locals dressed in panda costumes participate in the annual spring tea-picking festival in Ya'an, Sichuan Province, according the People's Daily.

Tea leaves in this plantation are known as 'panda tea', which is green tea cultivated with the faeces of China's symbolic animal.

The first pick is expected to sell for ¥440,000 (£46,000) per kg. 

The man behind the brew is An Yanshi, a super panda enthusiast from Sichuan and a lecturer at Sichuan University.

Since he invented the tea in November 2011, An has collected 10 tons of panda droppings to fertilise the plantation.

He promises drinkers they can expect 'a mature and nutty taste'. 

Mr Yanshi said: 'Pandas have a very poor digestive system and only absorb about 30 per cent of everything they eat. 

Poo power: Mr An has used 10 tons of droppings of these cuddly animals since 2011 to grow green tea

'That means their excrement is rich in fibres and nutrients.

'Just like green tea, bamboo contains an element that can prevent cancer.'

First batch of tea every year, usually picked in spring, is considered the best brew in China. 

An said he hoped his 'panda poo tea' could make it into the Guinness Book of World Records as the most expensive tea. 

Serious fan: Mr An has a large collection of panda souvenirs including clothes and paintings
