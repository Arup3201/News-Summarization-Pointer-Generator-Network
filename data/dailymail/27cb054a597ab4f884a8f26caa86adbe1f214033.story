A storm is due to blanket states in the south with snow, then head the the pummeled Northeast to smash all-time snowfall records.

Meteorologists predict the downfall will strike Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri through Wednesday.

Predictions the majority of Kentucky as at risk from more than ten inches of snow, while Tennessee and surrounding states will get a lighter coating of between three and six.

Coming storm: The storm is expected to hit the South first, then move towards the Atlantic coast

More of this? Tennessee is due to be hit by the snow, which follows an unusually white winter in the state. Above is five-year-old Nike Christian with a snow-blower in Knoxville

The system is then expected to sweep Northeast, pushing past Washington, D.C., and New York City before hitting Boston to potentially set a new snowfall record, according to AccuWeather.

While less than six inches is expected in Massachusetts, the extra snow could be enough to push the city past its annual snowfall record of 107.6 inches.

The total, according to local station WCVB, currently sits at 104.1 inches after a modest coating over the weekend. The current record was set in the winter of 1995-96.

Buried again: Boston, pictured above last week, has been hit by 104.1 inches of snow this winter - and this week is set to break the all-time record

Earlier: Parts of the downfall could take the form of freezing rain or sleet as temperatures are not expected to be low

But while the storm could bring snow, it will not necessarily bring any cold.

Temperatures in the area are not expected to dip far below freezing, meaning more southerly parts of the storm could drop rain or sleet instead.

Winter weather warnings and advisories were published by the National Weather Service for more than 100million people Tuesday as the southern storm begins, and an earlier one develops over the Midwest.
