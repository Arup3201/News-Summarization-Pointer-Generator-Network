Hidden: The cameras may be a hard-to-spot grey - which critics say will do little to slow drivers down

Speed cameras to catch motorists driving in excess of 70mph are to be installed along motorways for the first time.

So-called stealth cameras – which may be grey rather than bright yellow – will be placed on stretches of some of the busiest routes, including the M1, M6 and M25.

Previously, motorway speed cameras have been situated mainly on stretches undergoing roadworks, in order to enforce variable speed limits for safety reasons.

Some ‘safety camera partnerships’ have also placed them in vans parked on bridges above the carriageway.

Speed cameras to catch motorists driving in excess of 70mph are to be installed along hundreds of miles of motorway for the first time.

New so-called ‘stealth cameras’ - which may be grey rather than bright yellow - will be placed on stretches of some of the most important motorways including the M1, M6 and M25.

The Highways Agency is looking at the widespread introduction of cameras to target drivers exceeding the maximum allowed speed of 70mph.

According to officials, this will prevent jams and allow better traffic flow by controlling speed limits and opening hard shoulders to traffic during busy periods.

But motoring groups claim the introduction of cameras is not about road safety but about generating income through fines.

A recent poll in Autocar found that 94.6 per cent of motorists admitted driving in excess of 70mph while on the motorway. Critics have pointed out that less visible cameras will have no impact on actually slowing drivers down.

It recently emerged that the Highways Agency has launched a consultation over the speed limit on a section on the M1 between Derbyshire and South Yorkshire.

It could see its speed reduced to 60mph for 12 hours a day - between 7am and 7pm - because of fears that congestion is reducing air quality and would be policed by cameras and police patrols.

Yesterday Roger Lawson, of the Alliance of British Drivers (ABD), said: 'We are opposed to speed cameras in general.

'The evidence of their success in promoting safety is not good and in reality what is happening now is that the police are using speed cameras to fund their other activities through speed awareness courses.'

He added: 'If these cameras are grey 
rather than yellow they are going to be harder to spot and so will have 
no impact in slowing traffic down. If there is a good reason for the 
traffic to be slowed down then the cameras need to be as visible as 
possible.'

Generating income: Motoring groups say the cameras for routes such as the M6, pictured, are an attempt to make money

The ABD has called for an increase in the upper speed limit on motorways to 80mph.

This was considered by ministers but appears no nearer to becoming law.

The new cameras, dubbed Hadsec3 (Highways Agency digital enforcement camera system) will be and running along more than 100 miles of motorway within two years, with the further roll-out eventually covering at least 400 miles.

Since 2010, some police forces have cut back on their use of speed cameras because the tickets can cost too much to process.

But digital technology has made it cheaper and easier to install, monitor and collect information from cameras.

A spokesman for the Highways Agency said: ‘These are not stealth cameras they are more visible that they were before. These motorways are not about speed limits.

'They are about smoothing the traffic flows and increasing capacity.’

The spokesman said the new cameras would be signposted and added: 'The onus is on the driver to abide by the speed limit.’
