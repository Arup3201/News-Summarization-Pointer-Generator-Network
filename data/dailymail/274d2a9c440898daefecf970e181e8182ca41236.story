Samuel Eto'o insists he does not have a point to prove to Jose Mourinho as he prepared to make his Everton debut against Chelsea.

The Cameroon striker was unveiled as Everton's fifth major signing of the summer and revealed that he has selected the unusual No 5 jersey – not a number usually associated with strikers – as it 'received wisdom that you change shirts when you get older'.

Eto, 33, became embroiled in a spat with Mourinho last season at Chelsea when the Portuguese was revealed by a French television station in a private moment questioning his age – Mourinho later insisted that he was joking.

It is perhaps fate, then, that Eto'o could return to haunt Mourinho on Saturday evening at Goodison Park following his release from Stamford Bridge but the former Barcelona and Inter Milan star stressed he does not have a problem with his old boss.

'The only thing I have to say about Jose is that I want to thank him for giving me my opportunity in English football,' said Eto'o, who has signed a two-year deal. 'It is down to him that I have had the chance to play and integrate into the Premier League. That is the end of the matter.'

Everton manager Roberto Martinez is thrilled to have added Eto'o to a group that he has bolstered with Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry, Mohamed Besic and Christian Atsu and Eto'o, who scored 12 times for Chelsea, is adamant he can make a contribution.

'I wanted to play football here and I enjoyed my meeting with Roberto Martinez,' said Eto'o. 'Everton fit my philosophy on the way the game should be played. I had a good feeling from the comments he made to me.

'I want to bring my experience to the squad. Everton have a winning mentality and I want to help them continue with that. I won't say what we can achieve, I will just concentrate on the philosophy I have of taking things game by game.'

Eto'o met Liverpool officials last Friday in Paris and had a medical examination as Brendan Rodgers concerned alternatives should his move for Mario Balotelli fall down but Eto'o is adamant that he could not have joined a better club than Everton.

'In the last 10 days I have travelled quite a lot and met a lot of managers,' said Eto'o. 'But the one that gave me most belief was Roberto. I now want to help the team and use my experience. I wanted to stay at the top.'

And providing a full explanation of why he picked No 5, Eto'o added: 'The received wisdom is that your numbers change when you get older. Five was available, so I picked that. I could have gone for 22, which is the birthday of my future wife. Maybe next year, if I change again, I will pick that one.'
