On a sunny day, they boast some of the finest scenery England has to offer.

So can it be coincidence that some of our top seaside and country beauty spots also happen to contain the locals who pull the most sick days?

Employees in areas near beauty spots such as Worthing in West Sussex (pictured) are off with illness up to three weeks a year compared to national average of four days, Public Health England's regional figures show

A league table of workplace absenteeism is enough to make even a trusting boss raise an eyebrow.

It suggests a rather suspicious link between the number of days taken off ill and places where there’s a range of temptations on the doorstep.

Employees round Worthing and Shoreham in West Sussex – fringed on one side by miles of south coast beaches and rolling hills on another – are the most likely to come down with something. 

The league of Britain's workplace sickness numbers shows most are from the country's top locations

They have almost three working weeks off sick each year compared with a national average of around four days. Curiously, the top ten features next to none of the industrial heartlands which traditionally have the worst health records.

Instead, the most ailing staff are from places like the Cotswolds and Allerdale in the heart of the Lake District.

Public Health England’s 2010-2012 figures give a regional breakdown of the proportion of working days lost to sickness absence. The national average was 1.6 per cent, around four days per year per person.

But Adur has the highest rate of all: 5.5 per cent which is approximately 14 days. 

The district incorporates the seaside towns of Lancing and Shoreham-by-Sea, which are popular with sunbathers and surfers. Second in the table is Weymouth & Portland in Dorset (4.3 per cent – 11 days), a resort built on miles of sandy beaches.

Also featuring in the top ten with 3.7 per cent (nine days) are Tendring in Essex, which includes the holiday hotspots of Clacton and Frinton-on-Sea; the picturesque rural haven of the Cotswolds in Gloucestershire and Allerdale in Cumbria which boasts Lake District beauty spots such as Keswick and Buttermere.

Among the best rates nationwide were Sedgemoor in Somerset and Wyre in Lancashire – where the typical employee takes next to no time at all off sick

Ken Bishop, a Shoreham-by-Sea councillor, said: ‘Perhaps it is just too tempting round here on a nice day to think “to hell with work”.

‘This is a great place to be. It still has a villagey feel to it and everybody knows everybody else – though that means you’d have to be careful you weren’t spotted on the beach when you were supposed to be in bed ill.’
