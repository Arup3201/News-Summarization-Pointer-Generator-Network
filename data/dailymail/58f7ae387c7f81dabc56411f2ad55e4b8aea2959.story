A newborn baby was mauled to death by his grandmother’s pet Jack Russell as he slept in his cot, an inquest heard yesterday.

Harry Harper suffered a fractured skull and brain damage after he was bitten by the terrier in his table-top carry cot when grandmother Teresa Bell’s back was turned.

Mrs Bell had taken the eight-day-old infant downstairs to give his parents, Mikayla Bell, 19, and trainee electrician father Tom Harper, 19, a lie-in.

In a statement read out to the inquest, she told how she had gone into the kitchen to see her twin 16-year-old daughters off to school and ‘assumed’ seven-year-old terrier PJ had followed her.

She then heard Harry cry out and went into the living room to discover the infant covered in blood in the cot with the dog sitting by his feet.

Harry was pronounced dead in hospital about 90 minutes after he was attacked in the family home in Ketley, near Telford, Shropshire, last November. The dog, which had never bitten anybody before and was usually placid, was put down.

Mrs Bell said she left the sleeping infant in the carry cot ‘on a table against the wall’ as she waved goodbye to her daughters.

She discovered the dog in the cot after rushing back into the living room when the baby cried.

She said: ‘I heard Harry cry. I went straight into the front room and could see PJ sat inside the carry cot at a space by Harry’s feet.

‘He had something that looked like sick on his head. I pulled the dog out and carried Harry to the kitchen.

‘I remember he was bleeding at the back of his head. There was a lot of blood on his head and in the carry cot.

‘I realised straight away that PJ must have bit Harry. I was in shock at what had happened, thinking it was my fault.’

Harry’s mother, Mikayla, described PJ as ‘mild-mannered’.

Miss Bell, a sales assistant and part-time model, said she heard screams and ran downstairs to see ‘Mum holding Harry over the sink’. She added: ‘Mum was repeatedly saying “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” and I heard Mum say “He’s been bitten”.

‘I think at some point Mum said it was PJ that had bitten him.’

Dog attack law changed

Miss Bell said she didn’t blame anybody for her son’s death, which she described as a ‘really tragic accident’.

Her
40-year-old mother told the coroner, sitting at Wellington Civic 
Centre, near Telford, that she would ‘always wonder whether I could have
done something differently that morning’.

Detective
Inspector Phil Shakesheff, of West Mercia Police, told the inquest that
the family had an ‘unblemished history of caring for and controlling 
many dogs over a period of many years’.

He added: ‘There is no evidence 
to suggest that the death of Harry is anything other than a tragic 
incident that can’t be ruled out from occurring in any other dog-owning 
household where children are present.’

Since
2007, the inquest heard, dogs have killed eight people in Britain, 
including six children. Recording a verdict of accidental death, 
Telford’s assistant deputy coroner, Andrew Barkley, urged dog owners to 
recognise the dangers posed to small children by their pets.

After
the hearing, the family said in a statement: ‘We remain absolutely 
devastated by Harry’s death. Although Harry was only with us for eight 
days, he had brought enormous happiness to us all and his loss is a 
tragedy that we will all carry with us forever.’

At
the time of the tragedy, an animal behaviour expert said the dog may 
have attacked the infant after becoming jealous at his introduction to 
what the animal considered to be its territory.
