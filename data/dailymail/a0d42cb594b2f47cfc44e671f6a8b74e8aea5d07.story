New light can be shed today on one of Wimbledon’s mysteries of 2014 — Andy Murray’s supposed cry during his quarter-final exit referring to something ‘five minutes’ before the match started.

Credible sources close to those in the Murray camp, at whom it was directed, have told Sportsmail that the two courtside photographers who initially reported this slightly misheard what was shouted.

What he actually declared was ‘Forty-five minutes before the match’ (expletive deleted). It is a significant difference that could explain a lot.

Unhappy: Sportsmail understands Andy Murray did not launch an X-rated rant towards his own team

Frustrated: The courtside photographers misheard Murray as he shouted 'forty-five minutes'

X-rated: Murray was thought to have been heard swearing towards his own team at Wimbledon

Wimbledon officials and Murray himself have been adamant that there was nothing unusual in the immediate build-up to the match or the ‘call’ to the two players that they would soon be required to report for Centre Court duty.

At that time Murray would presumably have been sitting quietly in the locker room getting his equipment together. All contact and preparation with his team would have been done and dusted.

However, 45 minutes beforehand he is likely to have been going through tactics and points to remember with his coaches Amelie Mauresmo and Dani Vallverdu. It is said that his cry of frustration was connected with a matter associated to that, possibly an instruction about his serve and ball toss.

It was therefore no more than the usual outburst of annoyance about something random that Murray often delivers at his bench.

Seasoned observers of the British No 1 are used to witnessing this sort of thing around the world.

The habit was largely curtailed when Ivan Lendl was present and has generally been seen less at Wimbledon than anywhere else.

While there is a danger of reading far too much into this one incident, it does highlight the current issues with his coaching team. Another day has passed without any announcement of how he plans to proceed with Mauresmo.

Back to the drawing board: Murray's  coach Amelie Mauresmo looks on as her player lost in straight sets

Murray is still figuring out exactly how it will work long-term with the French former champion, with whom he met last Thursday before she went away on holiday.

He needs to assess how she will fit in with long-serving staff like Vallverdu and Jez Green, who have expressed unease at the situation.

Meanwhile, Serena Williams, whose bizarre behaviour in the doubles was another mysterious Wimbledon occurrence, has recovered from her ‘viral illness’ and is still entered into this week’s Bastad Open in Sweden.

It is unclear whether she will be accompanied by coach Patrick Mouratoglou, who is said to have ended the personal side of their relationship just prior to Wimbledon.

Where do you go from here? Murray must decide on how he moves forward after Wimbledon
