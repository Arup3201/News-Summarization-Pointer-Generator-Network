Ebola fears struck in Newark and Chicago on Tuesday as passengers arriving from West Africa failed screenings at both city's airports.

A passenger who arrived to Newark International Airport, New Jersey via Brussels was taken  in an ambulance to be evaluated for the virus.

That passenger, who arrived on United flight 998, was taken to University Hospital in Newark in line with the new protocols, the CDC said.

Ebola fears struck in Newark, New Jersey and Chicago on Tuesday as passengers arriving from West Africa failed screenings at both city's airports. Officials take the temperature of a passenger arriving to Chicago O'Hare via West Africa on October 17 as part of the new screening protocols

A passenger landed at Newark airport on Tuesday and following a screening was taken to an area hospital to be further evaluated for Ebola

MailOnline was awaiting an update on the patient's condition from the hospital on Wednesday morning.  

'During the enhanced screening process for individuals arriving to the United States from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, an individual was identified as reporting symptoms or having a potential exposure to Ebola,' said the CDC.

The other passengers on Flight 998 were allowed through the gate and sent on their way.

The CDC or state agencies will contact the other passengers on the plane if it is determined they could be at risk for the virus, ABC News reported.

In Chicago, a Liberian child was stopped at O'Hare after vomiting once on the flight, reported Fox 32 Chicago.

The child reported no other symptoms such as fever, but was admitted to Lurie Children's Hospital. Medical staff found no cause to test the child for Ebola.

However, as per protocol, the girl was transferred to University of Chicago Medical Center for further evaluation.

In a separate incident, a Liberian man reported diarrhea and nausea symptoms to screeners and was taken to Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. 

The man, who reported a previous bout with typhoid fever, was evaluated and - like the child-- deemed not in need of an Ebola test.

Airports in New York, Washington, Chicago and Atlanta are doing the screenings along with Newark. 

Federal health officials say the entry screenings add another layer of protection to halt the spread of the Ebola virus that has killed thousands. 

Screeners will use no-touch thermometers to try to find passengers with fevers.

The screenings started at New York's Kennedy International Airport on October 11. 

Screenings began last Thursday at Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, Newark's Liberty and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta, Georgia.

Customs officials said about 150 people traveled daily from or through Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea to the U.S. 

Nearly 95 per cent of them land first at one of those five airports.

As of Monday, authorities had screened 37 incoming Newark passengers, reports NorthJersey.com.
