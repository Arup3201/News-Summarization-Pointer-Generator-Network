The Good Life in Shrewsbury has been recognised by the Observer Food awards - but found itself the subject of scathing reviews

Despite its local reputation as a great place to eat, last autumn The Good Life was struggling to attract outside custom.

Profits even fell by a quarter as visitors to Shrewsbury apparently opted to steer clear of the vegetarian restaurant - despite it being awarded a runner-up medal in the Observer Food awards.

They had perhaps been put off by a series of online reviews, such as one on TripAdvisor that said: 'Staff cold and unattentive. The vegan option wasn't vegan. There were hairs in my quiche.'

Or they may have read one of about 30 similar postings that appeared on similar review sites.

But
 it has emerged that all the disparaging reviews were part of a personal
 vendetta against the Good Life's owner, Joanna Langfield, 40 - by a 
woman who had never even been to the restaurant.

In
 an apology published in The Times yesterday, Helen Griffiths, a marketing manager
 from Salford, admitted 'misrepresenting the quality of the food and 
service of the restaurant which, from other reviews and nominations, 
does indicate an exemplary track record.

She added: 'I made these comments based on 
absolutely no knowledge of the business, or any of the company's staff, 
as I have never actually visited or eaten at the restaurant.'

It is believed that the apology, which would have cost just under £1,000, was a condition of Ms Griffiths' police caution for harassment.

She is married to Ms Langfield's former 
partner. The attack started after Ms Langfield became involved in a 
legal dispute with Mr Griffiths in August.

'It started off quite extreme. 
Someone posted a review calling me "arrogant" and making other nasty 
references. TripAdvisor actually took that one down.'

Bad reviews then began appearing on a number of websites, with Ms Griffiths each time using different names.

Initial attempts by Ms Langfield herself and then Shrewsbury police to have TripAdvisor remove the posts failed.

The US-based company did not respond to any letters sent until they set  up a dedicated  UK customer  service operation.

A
 spokesman said: 'Every single report of suspicious content undergoes a 
full investigation by our content integrity team and if a review is 
found in breach of our guidelines, it will absolutely be removed from 
the site.'

Ms Griffiths was tracked down thanks to the help of a man who ran one of the sites on which she posted.

He gave police the IP address was linked to Warrington - where Ms Griffiths worked.

As a result of the malicious campaign The Good Life's profits slumped by 25 per cent.

Ms
 Langfield said: 'Before Christmas we got a statement from our 
accountant showing an unusual dip. It was a really distressing 
situation. I felt powerless to stop it.'

An

 investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority concluded the 
declaration was misleading as the website, which has around 50 million 
users' comments, cannot guarantee they are all genuine.

The ruling came after complaints about the authenticity of reviews on the world's biggest travel site, with accusations that some businesses and even guests were putting up fake comments.

TripAdvisor has faced claims that some establishments are being given poor write-ups by rivals to boost their own trade.

While, malicious customers have even tried to blackmail small hotels with threats to post negative reviews.

A spokesman for TripAdvisor said: 'We have confidence the 50million users who come to our site every month trust the reviews they read, which is why they keep coming back.'

Earlier
 this month TripAdvisor was told to change the wording on its website, which claims it offers 'trusted and honest' reviews.

TripAdvisor has been accused of carrying false reviews from hotels looking to boost custom

A VITAL TOOL FOR TRAVELLERS

Researchers last year claimed to have come up with a way of spotting fake reviews on travel websites such as TripAdvisor.

By studying the language of bogus recommendations they identified how companies fool the public into thinking their hotels and resorts are above par.

A direct mention of the place where somebody stayed is a dead giveaway, as is the heavy use of 'I' and 'we'.

Adverts which include lots of adverbs like 'really' and 'very' should be suspect, along with exclamation marks which denote false enthusiasm.

A focus on who the person was with, such as a husband or family, should also alert travellers they are being duped, the scientists said.

The research was commissioned after it emerged that hotels in Britain and abroad are bribing guests to write glowing reviews on website like TripAdvisor in exchange for cash or cut-price rooms and meals.

The researchers from Cornell University in the U.S. tackled the problem of what they dubbed 'deceptive opinion spam' by asking freelance writers to produce 400 fake reviews of Chicago hotels and post them on review websites.

They then mixed in 400 real reviews of the same hotels and asked three judges to try and tell them apart - but they were unable to do so.

The team then developed an algorithm which was able to spot a fake 90 per cent of the time.
