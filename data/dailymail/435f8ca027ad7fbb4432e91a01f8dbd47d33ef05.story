Miss Wesson, whose labour was two weeks early, has two other children

It is no doubt fairly common for children to be conceived at Glastonbury.

The newborn daughter of festival fanatics Heidi Wesson and Sean Crothers, however, is one of the very few to have been born on the famous fields.

In a dramatic labour late on Saturday evening - possibly induced by The Rolling Stones’s Satisfaction - Miss Wesson gave birth to a healthy daughter, supported by her partner and the close friends with whom they had been partying.

Music to her ears: Heidi Wesson (pictured with her one-year-old daughter Eadie) gave birth to another daughter at Glastonbury over the weekend

Miss Wesson, 33, from Leicester, later spoke of her joy at giving birth at the famous music festival, saying mother and baby were ‘fine and fabulous’.

Miss Wesson, whose labour was two weeks early, has two other children - Connor, ten, and Eadie, 11 months.

The young mother, who works in customer services at Next, gave birth to her newborn, who has yet to be named, at 3am on Sunday morning at the medical centre on site at Glastonbury. They are now recovering at a nearby hospital.

Miss Wesson’s mother Sandra last night said she warned her daughter not to go to the music festival while so heavily pregnant but she insisted she always gave birth late so it would not be a problem.

Her son Connor said he is disappointed his sister was born at Glastonbury because he ‘did not want her to be a hippy baby’.

Last night a spokesman for Glastonbury said that both mother and baby were doing well.He added: ‘We’d like to send our congratulations to the family. We look forward to welcoming them back in future years.

‘We’ve had babies born here that are now grown-ups. They still come every year. That’s a beautiful thing.’ After news spread about what happened among friends, Miss Wesson went online to assure them she was OK.

‘Thanks to everyone for looking after us,’ she wrote on Facebook.

‘We are over the moon and a little shattered ;-) xxx ps: sorry for interrupting your night off Nana bloody love you xxx.’

The keen music fan, who is a regular at Glastonbury, already has a young daughter named Eadie, but it is not thought she was with them at the time.

She was eight months pregnant when she gave birth early - a shock to those who were with her.

Tracy Harrison, who helped deliver the baby, said it was ‘not quite what I expected’.

She added: ‘Just helped deliver a beautiful daughter for Heidi Wesson and Sean. Thank you for waiting til nanna got there.... Lindsey Harrison thank you for been there x x x love you all x x x very much a Glastonbury baby x x.’

Earlier, friends and family used social networking sites to spread news about the birth.

Holleh Alyce Weston wrote: ‘Absolutely amazed that Heidi Wesson and Sean Crothers have had their baby at Glastonbury!! Congratulations.’

Rebs Morris-Richardson added: ‘Am absolutely chuffed to pieces for Heidi Wesson and Sean Crothers on the birth of their baby girl at Glastonbury, welcome little one and congratulations, whoop whoop,xx.’

Cousin Terry Albone added that Miss Wesson was the ‘only woman I know who, when eight months pregnant, would go to Glastonbury in that condition’.

He also joked: ‘Good job they were in a caravan.’ There were, however, conflicting reports about where exactly the child was born.

Fran Gale wrote on Twitter: ‘As if my cousin’s best mate gave birth in the middle of Glastonbury field!’

A woman is last known to have gone into labour at Glastonbury three years ago.

First-time mother Victoria Iremonger, 30, wanted to have her baby at the festival site but medics insisted that an ambulance was called and she was taken to nearby Yeovil Hospital.

She eventually gave birth to a healthy baby boy, Reuben, before returning to the festival the next day with the child and her partner Evan Jenkins, 31.

Last night, a spokesman for the festival would only say that mother and daughter were healthy and recovering well.
