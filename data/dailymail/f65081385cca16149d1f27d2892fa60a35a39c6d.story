How this lost reindeer must have longed for a shiny red nose. 

For the runaway deer appeared startled as it weaved through traffic while prancing around the dark streets of Kent early this morning. 

With the flurry of snow across the country today, perhaps the reindeer thought it was the time of the year to pull Santa's sleigh again.

The unusual sighting ground traffic to a halt in Loose village, Maidstone as firemen tried in vain to coax it with a carrot and a piece of rope.

The reindeer was spotted by baffled motorists in the aptly named Loose village in Maidstone, Kent this morning

As cars drove through Loose, the reindeer darted in to a residents' parking space before returning to the road

The startled reindeer then turned away and raced back in to the road - it was eventually sedated by a local vet

Firemen were initially called out and tried unsuccessfully to coax the reindeer with a carrot and a piece of rope

The runaway reindeer ground traffic to a halt for about 15 minutes this morning when it was seen in Maidstone

It evaded them until police led it in to a garden where a local vet sedated it. 

The reindeer's owners were called and came to collect the creature.  

Becky Hope, 20, said: 'We were in the car then all of a sudden this massive reindeer just sprung out into the road.

'It stopped all the traffic and everybody was taking pictures. It added about 15 minutes to my journey.

'I was in shock because obviously Christmas has gone so I didn't expect to see any reindeers.

'I was a bit annoyed because of the traffic but in the end I just think the whole thing was hilarious.'

Kent police said: 'Officers attended to ensure public safety until a vet arrived to sedate the animal, which has since been returned to its owner.'
