Savings of up to £1million held in a failing bank will be protected for up to six months, as regulators strive to avoid a repeat of the panic when Northern Rock faced collapse.

The Bank of England yesterday announced a range of measures designed to protect savers and taxpayers from another financial crisis.

They include automatically transferring savers to a different bank account if their own lender is collapsing.

Government wants to avoid a repeat of the extraordinary scenes in September 2007 when customers formed huge queues outside Northern Rock branches to withdraw their money

Under the new regime, savers who receive a temporary boost to money held in their bank account will be protected.

It is hoped this will give peace of mind to those who have just sold their home, received an inheritance or a large pay-out from an insurance policy.

Instead of the current limit of £85,000, deposits of up to £1milllion will be guaranteed for up to six months under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme,

The Bank of England said the temporary £1million limit - introduced in July next year - would cover around 99pc of house sales in the UK - and 92pc in London.

There will be no limit in the protection for pay-outs on personal injury claims.

The added protection will also prevent customers from having to split their money into £85,000 blocks to ensure their cash is covered.

The Government wants to avoid a repeat of the extraordinary scenes in September 2007 when customers formed huge queues outside Northern Rock branches to withdraw their money, in the first run on a UK bank for more than a century.

Savers with pensions and insurance policies will also receive more protection if their insurance company goes bust, with 100pc of the income from annuities protected under the compensation scheme instead of 90pc.

Last night one leading MP welcomed the move.

Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chairman of the Treasury Select Committee said: “With deposit insurance set at £85,000, many people at some stage in their lives could be briefly vulnerable to a catastrophic loss when they transact on a house or receive a legacy. Although the risk is very small something needs to be done – those people need some protection.’

A key priority of the Bank of England since the recent financial crisis has been to ensure banks are allowed to fail, without causing a meltdown in the financial system and disruption for customers.

The Government and regulators have pledged that taxpayers will never again be forced to bail out failed banks, following the £46billion injection of public money into Royal Bank of Scotland and the £20bn rescue of Lloyds during the financial crisis.

Under proposals announced by the Bank of England yesterday, if a smaller bank goes bust customers’ accounts will be automatically transferred to another lender within 24 hours so they can continue to withdraw their cash and use their cards.

Failing that customers should receive pay-outs from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme within seven days instead of the current 20 days.

There measures are set to come into force in the second half of 2016.

Under the new ‘bail-in’ regime, if a bigger bank collapses investors and bondholders will take the first hit and lose some or all of their money.

It is hoped this will minimise disruption for savers who will continue to have access to the £85,000 or more they have guaranteed under the compensation scheme.

Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England and chief executive of the Bank’s financial safety watchdog the Prudential Regulation Authority, said:

Andrew Bailey: ‘These proposals will allow customers to have continuous access to the money in their bank account – of receive payment from the FSCS is this is not possible’

‘These proposals will allow customers to have continuous access to the money in their bank account – of receive payment from the FSCS is this is not possible.’

Big lenders will be forced to ‘ringfence’ their High Street retail operations from their investment banks by January 2019, insulating ordinary savers from the risky activities of so-called ‘casino banks.’

The changes are expected to cost the industry between £1.7billion and £4.4billion, with industry experts warning mortgage rates could go up and savings rates could fall as banks pass on the costs to their customers.

Banks will have to submit their preliminary plans on how they expect to restructure their operations by December.
