Dean Farrimond killed two people by crashing into their taxi while driving his own car high on drugs and alcohol

A drunk motorist killed a taxi driver and his passenger in a head on crash while 'fishtailing' across the road having binged on cocaine and lager. 

Dean Farrimond was driving on the wrong side of the road when he lost control of his car and smashed into the oncoming taxi. 

Driver Kenneth Grimshaw, 59 and passenger Emma Houghton, 23, died after the vehicle was thrown backwards into a house in Leigh, Greater Manchester. 

Tests taken after the fatal collision showed Farrimond, a father-of-three, was more than twice the legal alcohol limit when he got behind the wheel. 

The 35-year-old was jailed for eight years today after telling police he did not remember the incident on November 30, 2013. 

Liverpool Crown Court heard Mr Grimshaw was a driving instructor by day, and had taken up work with a private taxi company when he collected Miss Houghton, a mother-of-two. 

Farrimond had been drinking and taking drugs including diazepam and cocaine at a nearby social club when decided to drive home. 

At around 4am, witnesses described his 'out of control' driving. He had travelled around one kilometre when his car veered into the path of Mr Grimshaw and Miss Houghton. 

The taxi driver died at the scene while Miss Houghton was taken to hospital. She later died of head injuries. 

Judge Clement Goldstone QC told Farrimond he did not believe that he could not remember the horrendous crash. 

'You knew perfectly well what had happened but you were not able or willing to accept responsibility for the enormity of what you had done. 

'It was an appalling piece of driving and that cocktail of three components but principally alcohol, was to prove a lethal one,' he said. 

Farrimond was banned from driving for ten years. 

Miss Houghton's father, Stuart Foy, described his daughter as a 'fun and bubbly' woman who 'loved life'. 

'Emma was a young girl that loved life. Now she has been taken from us, her children will never grow up to know their mother.' 

Mr Grimshaw's daughters paid tribute to their 'hard-working' and 'selfless' father.

A judge at Liverpool Crown Court rejected Farrimond's claim he could not remember the events of the crash 

Sgt Mark Thomas from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit said: 'Due to Farrimond’s irresponsible and reckless actions, two families have been left truly devastated.

'Emma was a young woman who was just starting out in life and Ken was a loving family man who had two daughters and three grandchildren.

'Both families have been left with huge voids in their lives that will never be filled but hopefully, this sentencing can help a little with closure.'
