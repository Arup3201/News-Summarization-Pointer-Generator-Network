Boyfriend: Matthew Puccio is said to have stabbed Miss Sacco, placed a bag over her head and suffocated her at home on or around March 22

The man accused of stabbing his 
on-again, off-again girlfriend, suffocating her and dismembering her 
body told a newspaper she begged him to kill her and forced a knife he 
held into her own torso.

Matthew Puccio, 25, of Urbana, Ohio, is charged with murder in the death of 21-year-old Jessica Sacco.

He told the Dayton Daily News from jail on Wednesday that he plans to plead guilty and deserves death.

Puccio says the couple argued in 
their apartment the night before her March 22 death and she asked him to
'slash her throat, slash her wrists, do something'.

Two other couples are accused of watching Puccio murder his girlfriend and then help him dispose of her remains.

They had just recently moved in with them after meeting on the Internet, police said last night.

Some of Jessica's body parts were 
found abandoned in a bathtub at the property last Friday, the rest were 
discovered 90miles away in Kentucky.

Puccio stabbed Miss Sacco, placed a bag over her head and suffocated her at home on around March 22, police believe.

Watching the killing and helping dispose of some of the remains were flatmates Andrew Forney, 26, and his wife Kandis Forney, 25, both of Fenton, Michigan, along with a third couple from Urbana, it is alleged.

Victim: Jessica Sacco, 21, was stabbed, suffocated and dismembered at her home in Urbana, Ohio. her boyfriend said she begged him to kill her

Miss Sacco's body was found after a pedestrian alerted a police officer in a patrol car eight days later on March 30.

Urbana Police Chief Matt Lingrell said last night that Puccio and Miss Sacco had met the Forneys on the Internet, but he would not be more specific.

Chief Lingrell said the couples had known each other only a short time before the Forneys moved into the Urbana apartment about a month ago.

He said it was not clear how Puccio and Miss Sacco knew the third couple - Christopher Wright, 37, and Sharon Cook, 25, also from Urbana - but all five suspects were only recently acquainted.

He said: 'They're just loose friends.'

Tragic: Miss Sacco's remains were not found until eight days after she was believed to have been killed

It is alleged the Forneys, Wright and 
Cook were in the apartment when Miss Sacco was killed but failed to 
intervene. Puccio and Andrew Forney then moved Miss Sacco's body to the 
bathtub and dismembered it.

Miss Sacco, who once took classes at a local college, had been in Urbana for about a year after moving there from California, while Puccio had only been in the city for a few months. Both were unemployed.

Miss Sacco probably died of suffocation, Champaign County coroner Joshua Richards said. A single stab wound to her upper abdomen did not penetrate vital organs.

Arrested: Husband-and-wife flatmates Andrew and Kandis Forney are accused of failing to intervene during the killing and then helping Puccio dispose of Miss Sacco's body

Team-work: A third couple, Sharon Cook, 25, and Christopher Wright, 37, have also been charged with failing to intervene during the killing and helping to cover it up

Puccio and the Forneys were arrested 
in 80miles away in Hamilton, Ohio, over the weekend and were being 
transferred back to Urbana to face charges there.

Puccio was arrested on charges of murder, assault, corpse abuse and tampering with evidence.

Andrew
Forney was charged with corpse abuse, obstructing justice, tampering 
with evidence and complicity to tamper with evidence; Kandis Forney was 
charged with complicity to tamper with evidence and obstructing justice.

Wright
and Cook were arrested on charges including corpse abuse and tampering 
with evidence. They were arraigned by video in Urbana Municipal Court 
yesterday, and bail was set at $50,000 each.
