Most dieters see chocolate as the devil's food avoid it at all costs in their mission to slim down.

But one sweet-toothed slimmer has revealed chocolate has actually helped her shed more than seven stone.

Stephanie Jones, 38, found the key to losing weight was drinking chocolate tea, which she stumbled across as she tried to slim out of her size 32 clothes.

Her former self: Stephanie admitted she was 'like a baby elephant' when she weighed 20st 1lb just a year ago

Before and after: Stephanie slimmed down from 20st and size 32 to 12st and healthy size 16 on her quirky diet

And the chocolate drop diet worked by satisfying her taste for sweet treats - thus helping her slim down from more than 20st and a size 32 to 12st and a slim size 16.

Speaking about her quirky diet trick, office worker Stephanie said: 'People don't believe me when I tell them I lost nearly eight stone by drinking chocolate tea.

'But it's true - that's exactly how I lost all this weight.'

Stephanie decided she had to lose weight when, thanks to her love of cakes, doughnuts, pastries and biscuits, she realised the scales were tipping at 20st.

But Stephanie said: 'I hated drinking water. It was so bland and boring. Then I thought about tea instead - and went looking for fruit teas. But then I found this chocolate tea which was calorie free.

'If I can't have chocolate then I can have chocolate tea. So if I fancied something sweet I would have chocolate tea.

'Now I'm drinking up to 20 cups of chocolate tea a day, or sometimes opting for vanilla, fruit, liquorice and herbal tea too. It's my secret to success.'

Follow her lead: Stephanie, who is 5ft 11in and now weighs a 12 stone healthy, is recommending other women to follow her chocolate tea diet

Stephanie, from Abercynon, South Wales, admitted she was 'like a baby elephant' when she weighed 20st 1lb just a year ago.

She said: 'I was popping out of my size 32 clothes. I could hardly find anything to wear - just tent style dresses and baggy tops.

'Anything to make me blend into the background.

'I would keep a cupboard with all my favourite snacks such as chocolate, liquorice or marshmallow.

'Breakfast was pancakes drowning in syrup, huge fry-ups and buttered crumpets. At night I'd eat Mars bars and doughnuts without a second thought.'

Feeling fantastic: She said: 'I've swapped snacking for sipping a cup and lost nearly eight stone in just 50 weeks. I am a size 16 and I feel fantastic'

She said: 'I've swapped snacking for sipping a cup and lost nearly eight stone in just 50 weeks. I am a size 16 and I feel fantastic.

'I have so much energy and I finally feel alive.

I have even run 5km - something I could never have even dreamed about before.'
