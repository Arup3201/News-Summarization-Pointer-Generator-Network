At least five people including two children have been buried under a landslide which swept over a village near a coal mine in southern China.

An estimated 5,000 cubic metres of rock fell over six sheds in the Yudong village in Kaili, in the Guizhou province of China at around 11am yesterday.

Those buried were believe to be miners and their families who worked at a nearby coal mine.

More than 400 rescuers are at the scene searching for survivors but their efforts are being hampered by continued rock slides.

Around 20 miners were in the Ping Di coal mine as work restarted following the Chinese New Year when the landslide happened.

All of them rushed out safely after hearing a loud noise, the Global Times reported.

One said: 'I didn't know what happened. I followed the other coal miners and ran out. I just heard some noises.'

A Chinese official said geologists are at the scene to look at conditions on the mountain as rescuers continue the search for survivors

Pan Mei, a survivor, told the Global Times: 'I was watching TV at home. I was thinking about going to the market and heard a loud noise. It lasted for about five minutes. I ran out. There was a lot of dust. When I got out, I saw the landslide.'

Huang Yuanliang, secretary of the Kaili Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, is at the site of the landslide to direct rescue efforts.

He said conditions are not ideal for rescue work and a team of geologists is looking into conditions on the mountain.

An investigation into the cause of the landslide is underway.
