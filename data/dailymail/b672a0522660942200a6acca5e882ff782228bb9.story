Israeli police have stormed a holy site in Jerusalem’s Old City where they hurled stun grenades to disperse dozens of protestors who they say were throwing stones at officers.

The clash occurred outside the al-Aqsa mosque, one of Islam’s holiest sites, after Friday prayers.

Two people suffered minor injuries and one other person was arrested for trying to stab a policeman as he was being taken into custody, according to Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld.

The mosque is situated in an area revered by Jews as well as Muslims and is a source of friction between the two religious groups.

Riots have broken out at the site before in 2000 after a visit by then Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon.

Earlier this week, hardline Israeli activists were arrested for trying to hold prayers at the compound, referred to as the Temple Mount by the Jews and believed to be the site of two biblical temples.

An aide to the Palestinian president said today’s protest was because of that visit.

The incident happened during a seven-day Jewish holiday, a time of pilgrimage to the adjacent Western Wall remnant of the second temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD, now a focal point of Jewish prayer.

The site where al-Aqsa stands, which Muslims call the Nobel Sanctuary, is also home to the golden Dome of the Rock from where the Prophet Mohammad ascended to heaven.

Israel captured east Jerusalem in a 1967 war including the walled old city where the holy sites are located, and annexed it as part of its capital in a move never recognised internationally.

Palestinians want that part of the city as capital of a state they seek in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
