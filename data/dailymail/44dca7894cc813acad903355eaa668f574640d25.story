A young woman who was sexually assaulted and then spent five days in jail when police turned her from victim into accused won a ‘marathon legal battle’ and received a $1.5 million settlement for her tribulations.

The liability insurance carrier for Pennsylvania's Cranberry Township paid the settlement money to Sara Reedy (also identified in court documents as Sara Watt) after several years of legal processing.

Her vindication against the police detective who arrested her for theft and falsely reporting a crime has helped change federal law in regards to how rape cases are handled.

Payback: Rape victim Sara Reedy sued Pennsylvania's Cranberry Township Police Department for arresting her after she was sexually assaulted and settled out of court for $1.5 million

Reedy was a 19-year-old college student 
when a man entered the gas station where she worked, stole $606.73 from 
the register, put a gun to her head and demanded oral sex, saying he 
would shoot her if she refused.

‘I had images of my family finding me dead,’ she recently told London’s Observer newspaper about the attack that occurred on July 14, 2004. ‘I closed my eyes and just tried to get it over with.’

After sexually assaulting Reedy, her attacker Wilbur Brown, 44, fled the scene and spent more than a year undetected before striking again.

In that time Reedy, who is now 27, was held responsible for his theft.

Frank Evanson, the Cranberry Pennsylvania police detective who interviewed Reedy in a nearby hospital, didn't believe her when she told him what happened.

That was after Reedy allowed hospital workers to conduct a rape kit examination, which was never followed up on.

Instead of going after her reported attacker, Evanson accused Reedy of stealing the money herself and creating the story as a cover-up.

After further police inquiries, Reedy was arrested for theft and falsely reporting a crime and sent to jail. She was pregnant with her first child at the time, she said.

Reedy was subsequently released on bail, but lost her job at the gas station.

Evanson continued to accuse her of the theft and falsely reporting a crime, despite another sexual attack in the area three months later ‘that was substantially similar,’ and which Evanson became the lead investigator on.

Then, a month before Reedy's trial, her attacker was arrested after he raped another woman in a convenience store close to the Gulf station where Reedy had worked.

After his arrest Brown admitted to sexually assaulting Reedy in 2004 and stealing the $606.73.

Reedy was in court in 2006 to see him plead guilty to assaulting 10 women in total. Brown is now serving life in prison.

When the charges against her were dropped, Reedy sued Evanson and the Cranberry Police Department.

That case was initially dismissed in a district court in 2009.

Then with help from several non-profit groups and a local attorney, Reedy appealed.

In March 2010, the appeal judges ruled that Evanson had not acted reasonably and lacked probable cause when he arrested Reedy. They decided that the case could go to trial.

The Cranberry Township finally settled before trial on behalf of Evanson, who is still on the job.

Reedy's $1.5 million payment could only be revealed now she said because of a non-disclosure clause that was part of the settlement. United National Insurance Co., which covers the Cranberry Township, made the payment.

The settlement amount 'will close the matter, bypassing the uncertainty of courtroom litigation and the expense of attorney's fees,' according to a joint statement between both sides.

Reedy's case has helped persuade the U.S. federal government to change the definition of rape to include forced oral sex and the rape of men.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit implemented new case law providing updated guidance on how police should investigate sexual assault cases.

'That information is part of our constant, comprehensive continuing education program for all Officers,' Cranberry Township's manager Jerry Andree told MailOnline in an email response.

'This was a very difficult issue for everyone and we are sorry this 
happened to Ms. Reedy. We are glad the parties could arrive at agreeable
 terms that will allow the parties to move on,'

A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania State Police told MailOnline that the state police 'was in no way' involved in the matter.

The Cranberry Police Department did not return requests for comments.

‘I'm relieved that people will be able 
to see now that I was telling the truth,’ Reedy said during her interview with the Observer. 
‘Although mine is an extreme case, I'm not the first – and I won't be 
the last.’
