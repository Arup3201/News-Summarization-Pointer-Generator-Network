What does the boxer who has everything buy for himself?

Floyd Mayweather Jnr is no stranger to showing off his impressive multi-million pound collection of supercars or his luxury private jet.

But one thing he probably hasn't had the chance to purchase is a mosaic of himself - until now.

A mosaic of Floyd Mayweather, which consists of 5,000 tiles, is on show in Manchester city centre

The mosaic was created by Manchester artist Mark Kennedy and took him three months to bring to life

Manchester artist Mark Kennedy has created exactly that and the design now adorns the iconic Affleck's Palace in the city.

The mosaic took three months to create and is made up of more than 5,000 tiles. 

It will be auctioned for local charities later this month at a Vegas Fight Night and Kennedy would love nothing more than a bid from the man himself.

'I'm a massive fan of all sports, but my dad is the big boxing fan in our family; I made this for him,' he said.

'He believes Floyd is the greatest boxer in the world. If Floyd was to bid on the mosaic it would be fantastic. He needs a bit of Mancunian art in his world! 

'Manchester is known worldwide for its outstanding music, arts and culture, so it would be a fantastic piece for any collector.' 

Mayweather is currently deliberating over whether to finally take on his long-time rival Manny Pacquiao in May

Mayweather is no stranger to Manchester having fought Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas in 2007

Mayweather's last fight was his rematch against Marcos Maidana last September which he won on points

Mayweather is no stranger to Manchester having fought the city's favourite son Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas in 2007, stopping the Brit in the 10th round. 

The Las Vegas night on January 31 will include an appearance from former world champion Paulie Malignaggi.

And he told Sportsmail: ‘The fans always made me feel appreciated. Being part of this event in Manchester will go a long way to making me search deep inside me and remind me of the appreciation in the UK. 

'I think it will be a great event and to be invited is humbling.' 

The ‘Vegas Fight Night Comes To Manchester Event’ will take place on January 31 at Event City.
