Some of America’s most significant landmarks are under threat from climate change, and could be fundamentally damaged in the near future, according to a new study.

Sites as celebrated as the Statue of Liberty in New York and Kennedy Space Center in Florida are among the places identified as being in danger from unpredictable weather patterns.

Great icons, but for how long? The Statue of Liberty and Kennedy Space Center are at risk from rising waters

The survey, ‘National Landmarks At Risk’, has been conducted by Massachusetts-based research group the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS).

It lists 30 'endangered' historic attractions in 15 US different states.

The 30 locations have been included because, according to the report’s authors, ‘the science behind the risks they face is robust, and because together they shine a spotlight on the different kinds of climate impacts affecting the United States’ cultural heritage.’

New York's most famous monument, the Statue of Liberty, is, the study suggests, under threat from rising sea levels.

The report points to the example of Hurricane Sandy, which, in 2012, caused Liberty Island (where the Statue stands) to be swamped with water – resulting in considerable damage and the closing of the site for several months. Ellis Island was similarly hit.

The report worries that Sandy was not an isolated incident, but the start of a trend.

‘There is evidence that Sandy gained strength from unusually warm upper-ocean temperatures in the North Atlantic,’ it states. ‘These temperatures are expected to continue rising with global warming.’

The Kennedy Space Center, at Cape Canaveral on the east coast of Florida, is also deemed to be in the path of troublesome tides.

‘The launch pad is very close to the ocean and is vulnerable to the dangers of rapidly rising seas and storm surge,’ the survey argues.

The same situation could spark problems a little to the north on Florida’s Atlantic flank – where St Augustine is America’s oldest city, dating back to Spanish settlement in 1565.

‘Sea-level rise could significantly compromise the future of St. Augustine’s unique cultural heritage,’ the report warns.

‘For
 example, a rise of three feet – which is well within current 
projections – could permanently inundate portions of the city’s historic
 districts.’

Elsewhere in the south-east of the country, South Carolina’s heritage could face similar difficulties – not least Charleston. Founded in 1670, and situated on the edge of the ocean, the city is home to numerous historic structures of irreplaceable value.

The report advises that ‘the city’s longtime struggle with flooding is expected to worsen over the coming decades as global warming continues to increase the pace of sea level rise, and causes the heaviest rainfall events to dump more water than in decades past.’

And the danger from climate change is not restricted to the eastern seaboard, according to the authors of the study.

The high terrain of Colorado may be immune to sea surges – but other factors could reputedly wreak havoc in the mountainous state.

For 
example, Mesa Verde National Park – a hotspot of indigenous heritage 
near Durango, where a cluster of cliff dwellings dates back 4500 years –
 is at risk from wild fires.

Two
 such blazes caused enormous damage in 2000, destroying 52,000 acres of 
the national park – and the likelihood of further conflagrations is 
considered high.

Charleston has been a fixture in South Carolina since 1670 - but its coastal location is a cause for concern

‘For the past 50 years,’ the report says, ‘the temperatures in the Mesa Verde area have been rising, particularly during the summer, at a much faster rate than they did over the preceding century.

‘In the Southwest overall, it has been warmer since 1950 than any period of comparable length in at least 600 years.

‘Rising temperatures add to the region’s natural wildfire risk and increase the likelihood that when fires do occur, they will be larger and even more devastating.’

And even remote Alaska is not out of the reach of damaging weather patterns.

Cape Krusenstern National Monument – where archaeological sites pinned to the history of the Inupiat, the native Alaskans, date back over 4,000 years – is singled out as a cause for concern due to the fragmentation of this pristine section of shoreline.

‘Coastal erosion is washing away irreplaceable archaeological artefacts at particularly vulnerable coastal locations,’ the report posits.
