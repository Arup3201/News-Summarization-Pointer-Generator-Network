A banker once described as Ireland's public enemy number one has been charged over a failed insider trading scam.

Former chairman of Anglo Irish Bank Sean Fitzpatrick was brought before the Criminal Courts in Dublin for alleged financial irregularities.

He was earlier arrested at Dublin Airport as he arrived from the U.S. after arranging to meet officers.

Former Anglo-Irish chief Sean Fitzpatrick has been charged in Ireland over a failed insider trading scam

The court heard the 64-year-old replied 'no comment' when charged with 16 offences by gardai attached to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement in a city centre garda station.

Each charge relates to advising on and lending millions to a golden circle of investors to falsely inflate Anglo's share prices.

Bankrupt billionaire Sean Quinn's wife and children were among those involved in the ill-fated plot to save the sinking bank in July 2008.

Anglo was nationalised months later, in 
January 2009, and has since cost the Irish taxpayer about 30billion euro
(£23.4billion) - almost half the value of the country's bank bailout.

The Anglo Irish Bank sign was removed from its premises on St Stephen's Green, Dublin, in April last year

Since the crash of the Celtic-Tiger economy in 2007-2008, average house prices have fallen by more than 60 per cent with commercial properties falling at a similar rate.

One five-bedroom property in Tullamore, County Offaly, which was bought for €3.3million (£2.7m) during a fierce bidding battle at the height of the property boom.

But now, following a disastrous period for the country's economy, the property is on the market for just €395,000 (£325,500).

The 4,080 sq ft house had been purchased in 2006 by developers intent on building a 60-bed nursing home.

At the end of March, data from the Central Statistics Office revealed that residential property prices fell by almost 18 per cent in the year to February.

The property crash has resulted in more than 1,600 ghost estates across Ireland.

Prime Minister Enda Kenny is currently implementing massive budget cuts to get the country back on track after it was forced to accept a £70bn bailout from the EU - signalling once and for all the end of the Celtic Tiger boom years.

Fitzpatrick is the third person to be 
arrested so far this week in connection with an ongoing investigation 
into financial irregularities at the collapsed bank.

Mr FitzPatrick sat with his arms folded during the eight-minute hearing wearing a navy jacket,
blue shirt, pink tie and cream chino trousers.

Such was the anger against FitzPatrick after he refused to apologise for his role in creating a property bubble on TV, that he was dubbed the country’s public enemey number one.

There was no objection to bail. Judge 
Cormac Dunne granted bail of €1,000 and an independent surety of 
€10,000, which was provided by Mr FitzPatrick's sister, Joyce O'Connor.

Mr FitzPatrick was ordered to sign on every Wednesday at Irishtown Garda
station and to give gardaí 48 hours' notice if he plans to leave the 
State.

Former finance director Willie McAteer, 61, from Rathgar in south Dublin, and former managing director of lending at the toxic bank, Pat Whelan, 50, were charged with the same offences yesterday.

All three have been bailed and will reappear before the court on October 8.
