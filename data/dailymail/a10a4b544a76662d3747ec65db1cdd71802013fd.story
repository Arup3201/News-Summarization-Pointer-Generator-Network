The investigation into Michael Schumacher’s catastrophic accident has focused on whether his ski helmet was weakened by the camera attached to it.

The helmet shattered when the Formula One ace hit a rock while skiing at the French resort of Meribel, leaving him brain-damaged and fighting for his life.

Police are trying to establish why it smashed so dramatically – as Schumacher was only skiing at a moderate speed.

A source close to the investigation said: ‘Technically the equipment seems to have all been in good order. But why did the helmet explode on impact?

‘The laboratory has been testing to see if the camera weakened the structure.’

Recently his family was relieved with news that Schumacher had recovered from the pneumonia he picked up while lying in a coma in a French hospital, a German newspaper has reported.

The seven-times Formula One champion had already overcome the pneumonia by the time reports of his condition emerged earlier this week, according to daily tabloid Bild.

The news comes as Schumacher's family released a statement saying they 'strongly believe' the 45-year-old will recover from the December 29 skiing accident which has left him fighting for his life.
