It's not often that Zlatan Ibrahimovic is seen laughing and joking but the Paris Saint-Germain striker looked absolutely delighted with his own waxwork at its unveiling at the Grevin Museum on Monday. 

In fact, as the real Zlatan posed and smiled merrily in his PSG kit, onlookers could be forgiven for thinking the waxwork was more lifelike than the man himself with its arms raised in celebration and a glaring stare.

Ibrahimovic was so impressed with the model he uploaded a picture to Instagram alongside it with the caption 'I took the opportunity to take a selfie with myself at the Grevin Museum in Paris. The one to the right is made of wax and the one to the left is made of steel.'

As well as seeing the work at its inauguration, Ibrahimovic was also presented the elastomer and plaster cast used to create the wax effigy.

The 33-year-old striker was back on signature heroic form for his side  after a minor goal drought of one in six Ligue 1 games before his team's encounter with league leaders Lyon on Sunday.

Lyon had a 1-0 first half lead when PSG were awarded a penalty in the 69th minute.

Ibrahimovic saw his uncharacteristically tame spot kick kept out by Anthony Lopes but was allowed to retake his kick after referee Clement Turpin penalised Lyon's players for encroachment.

And he made no such mistake the second time, firing into Lopes' top right as the keeper again dived low to his left. 

PSG remain two points behind Lyon.
