If you’ve experienced the frustration of sitting in traffic while trying catch a flight, then one company has a solution; ditch the taxi and get a helicopter.

Gotham Air has just launched an on-demand service that effectively works like an ‘Uber for helicopters’, promising to get you from helipad to airport in six minutes

The company launched its service in New York this afternoon and says an average ride will work out at around $219 (£144).

Gotham Air has just launched an on-demand service that effectively works like an ‘Uber for helicopters’, promising to get you from helipad to airport in six minutes

An app and dedicated website allows users to request a helicopter to take a minimum of four passengers, and a maximum of six, to either JFK or Newark Airport.

Colour coding on the app reveals rides which are guaranteed and those which need more passengers in order to fly.

‘The goal is, after the first month, for there to be green [or available] flights every hour,’ Gotham Air's chief executive, Tim Hayes told Gizmodo.

‘So you can see, ok, this flight is green, it's confirmed, there are still two available seats left, and you could jump on it literally ten minutes before.’

And if a helicopter is grounded for weather reasons, the company says it will attempt to get passengers to the airport in a Tesla.

The helicopters run from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., but Mr Hayes wants the service to become 24 hours, according to Gizmodo

It isn't just Gotham Air who is offering helicopters on demand. Last month, Uber offered the novel form of transport to get to college football's national championship game.

Company spokeswoman Debee Hancock told The Dallas Morning News that 20 fans took the UberChopper air service to AT&T Stadium for the first College Football Playoff national championship game. Each paid $350 to be airlifted over traffic to the stadium in Arlington.

Uber teamed up with Epic Helicopters to offer the service. Passengers hailed a private car through Uber for a ride to a helipad, where they boarded a helicopter for an aerial tour of Dallas before being dropped off at the stadium to watch Ohio State play Oregon. 

The service launched today in New York, and the website and mobile are now open for bookings.

An app for iOS and Android will also be available in the near future.
