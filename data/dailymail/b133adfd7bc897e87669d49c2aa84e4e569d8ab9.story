Norwich boss Neil Adams saluted two-goal star Cameron Jerome as his side ended their long wait for a home league win.

Jerome took his tally to nine since joining from Stoke soon after the start of the season as the Canaries banked all three points at Carrow Road for the first time since mid-August.

But early-season leaders Norwich, who had failed to win any of their previous five games, were unable to score the third goal that would have taken them back to the top of the table.

That they failed was down to Bolton keeper Andy Lonergan's heroic second-half display.

Adams said: 'When I had the chance to sign Cameron it was a no-brainer. He ticked all the boxes. 'It's not just his pace and power. There's his hard work, his drive and his willingness.

'At half-time he was sitting on the treatment table with blood pouring out of a knee wound but there was no way he was going to come off.'

Jerome opened the scoring in the 12th minute when he nodded down to Jonny Howson then raced on to the midfielder's pass to stab the ball beyond Lonergan.

He leapt above Dorian Dervite just past the hour mark to head a second from a corner by experienced star Gary O'Neil, making his first league start.

Norwich would be sitting in pole position in the Championship but for a trio of stunning save from Lonergan.

England Under-21 winger Nathan Redmond played a one-two with Kyle Lafferty before unleashing a drive that the keeper pushed on to the far post.

Then Lonergan made two tremendous saves to keep out efforts by Steven Whittaker and substitute Lewis Grabban.

South Korean star Chung-Yong Lee took advantage of Martin Olsson's mistake to pull one back for the visitors near the end.

But Bolton boss Neil Lennon admitted: 'Norwich deserved to win. They were the better side and we didn't do enough.

'The players have to learn quickly. We need more from them if we are going to compete at this level.'

Norwich winger Elliott Bennett, 25, is on the brink of rejoining former club Brighton on a short-term loan.
