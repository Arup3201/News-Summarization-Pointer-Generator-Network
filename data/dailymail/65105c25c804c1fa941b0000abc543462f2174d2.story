Jonas Gutierrez has not given up hope of winning a new contract at Newcastle United.

The 31-year-old made his first appearance for the club in 17 months on Wednesday having twice beaten testicular cancer.

Gutierrez enjoyed a spine-tingling welcome from 50,000 fans inside St James’ Park as he came off the bench during the second half of Newcastle’s 1-0 defeat by Manchester United.

The Argentine’s contract expires this summer and it is thought he will be released by the club he joined in 2008.

Gutierrez, though, will fight for an extension.

‘I am living day by day,’ he said. ‘All I can do is work hard in training and work as hard as I can. I’m going to fight for my place — I always try to do that.

‘I’m recovering, I’m healthy and I’m feeling strong — now I have to wait for my opportunity and fight for that.

‘I have three months to do my best and we’ll see what happens. This is football, you are going to get opportunities so you have to be ready for that.’ 

Gutierrez was only given the all-clear following chemotherapy in November and in January he told Sportsmail it would be the biggest moment of his career were he to play again at St James’. And he added: ‘It was unbelievable, the welcome of the fans. It was a long wait so it was emotional. I have to say thanks to the fans for all the support they have sent me.

‘Since I’ve had my cancer and my treatment, I just think day by day. My first step was to be healthy again. After the doctor said I had recovered, I started thinking, “Now I want to train and want to prove how I feel”.

‘At the beginning it was hard because the body has to get used to the training. My body started feeling better and better and that was a big point, to get me where I am.

‘Now I want more. I’m improving every day.’
