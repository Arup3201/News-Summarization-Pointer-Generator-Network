Kirsty Wark described her meteoric rise through the BBC in a talk at Hay Festival in Wales yesterday

She is one of the best-known faces of the BBC.

But Kirsty Wark has joked she might not be where she is today were it not for the corporation’s positive discrimination policy.

The Newsnight presenter attributed her meteoric rise to ‘luck’ during her appearance at the Hay Festival in Wales yesterday.

She said her career path had corresponded with the different diversity drives of television bosses.

She said: ‘I rose through waves. When I went into graduate entry in 1976, they were looking for more women. And so I was a researcher and a producer.

‘Then when I looked for promotion, they needed to get more women into senior positions in production.

‘Then when I was presenting in Scotland, they needed more women on the telly. Then it was about being representative and needing more Scottish women on the telly.

‘And now we need more older women. So I think it’s been more luck than anything else.’

Dumfries-born Wark, 59, went straight to the BBC after graduating from Edinburgh University, beginning with BBC Radio Scotland.

She worked on Scottish and English television until 1993, when she joined the Newsnight team.

She said that she had only ever been bullied at work once - as a young researcher - and that it had been by a woman.

Giving advice to young girls entering the industry now, she said they should be ‘confident’ in themselves and ‘seek out mentors.’

In a wide-ranging interview, Wark also expressed concern that teenagers were being exposed to derogatory portayals of women.

She added that the internet had made it easier for those who want to put women down through ‘trolling’ on social media.

The 59-year-old was promoted when the corporation was looking for more women in senior positions, she said

‘Women still seem to be in the firing line,’ she said. It’s really sad for young women. I want women to feel comfortable about being on the web and on the streets.’

She said she longed for internet browsers to display signs urging people to respect their fellow users.

She said: ‘You wouldn’t go up to someone in the street and attack them, one hopes.

‘We don’t have a moral code with which to navigate the web.’

During the talk, Wark also lamented that the break-up of the church and its effect on the elderly.

When I joined they needed more women. Then more senior women. Then Scottish women. Now they need more older women... I've been lucky.

She said: ‘Whenever one thinks about religion, one thinks of community.

‘That I think now is breaking now. There’s a real problem with loneliness and isolation. I don’t think we yet know how to replace the threads that bind people through churches.

‘I was brought up in the church and I’m not religious but I see the value in that.’

She also said that society needed to address the growing issue of the number of people with dementia.

‘We don’t know how to cope with the fact that we are living longer,’ she said.

‘We need to get our minds to live longer. I don’t know if that’s something we can control.

‘I know that friends are frantically trying to get people to take someone who has Alzheimer’s. There aren’t enough places and actually is that [a home] the best place for someone with Alzheimer’s? I don’t think it is.’

Wark, who presents Newsnight, was talking about her first book, The Legacy of Elizabeth Pringle.
