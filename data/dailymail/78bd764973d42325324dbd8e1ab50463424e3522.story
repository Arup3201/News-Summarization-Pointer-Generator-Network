If you look out of your kitchen window today and see a giant inflatable island floating towards your home - don't worry, aliens are not about to land and you're not going mad.

You've probably just found a runaway sculpture inflated with helium which a couple of tipsy revellers released when it was moored at Cambridgeshire's Secret Garden Party.

The £12,000 Is Land, had been bobbing around in the sky to inspire party-goers having been built to represent the "slightly modified reality".

Missing: The £12,000 Is Land, had been bobbing around in the sky to inspire party-goers at the Cambridgeshire Secret Garden Party

However, around 3am on Sunday, July 24 two youths were spotted crossing the lake in a dinghy under the cover of darkness, who then promptly cut all five of its tether ropes and watched it sail away into the night sky.

Now a man-hunt has been launched to track down the seven-metre wide sculpture - created by Royal College of Art graduates Sarah Cockings and Laurence Symonds.

Data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted the inflatable land mass could now be as far as Slovenia, according to The Independent - over the town of Celje in fact - although organisers of the event hope it is still in the UK.

The island is due to be on display in the U.S. at this year's Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert, pictured, later on this month

It was last seen over Huntingdon, 
Cambridgeshire, 400 metres up - but no one from any of Britain's 
airports have spotted the unusual airborne art piece.

Some
residents claim to have seen it in Dorset - and one woman thought it 
was the Loch Ness Monster - whilst others thought extra-terrestrial life
was about to touch down.

A statement on the organisers' website 
said: 'The UK Civil Aviation Authority, local airports as well as 
chartered air spaces were informed, and attempts have been made to 
calculate the wind speed and direction around Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire
at the time of its release, any more accurate location updates will be 
published.

Under construction: The island is made of durable polyurethane, and is covered in green foliage

'However due to there being release valves on the balloon, the helium will have been slowly expelled over a long period of time, as opposed to rising quickly and rupturing, meaning the island could have reached great heights.

'But what goes up must come down, so the hunt is on. If what looks like a floating chunk of earth turns up in your Nan’s back garden, or if you think you see a new planet on your Easyjet flight to Portugal, please don’t hesitate to get in touch.'

Made of durable polyurethane, and 
covered in green foliage, organisers are desperate for it to be located -
it has a date in the U.S. at this year's Burning Man festival in the 
Nevada desert later on this month.

Into the ether: The sculpture floated off from the festival - and could be in Slovenia. The festival attracts around 26,000 visitors

The creation took six months to make - in Stroud in Gloucestershire.

About 26,000 visitors flocked from across the UK to the Secret Garden Party. The festival started in 2004 when just 1,000 people attended.

The event takes place in the grounds of a country house in the village of Abbots Ripton, near Huntingdon and the lake becomes the centre stage for various sculptures and other art pieces.

Any sightings should be reported via is-land.co.uk
