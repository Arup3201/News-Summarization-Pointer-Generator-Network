A woman with more than 100 arrests is facing charges of attempted murder after she allegedly ran over a man who was trying to stop her from stealing his Christmas daughter's present.

Marilyn Deboer, 42, and her boyfriend Ray Spiker allegedly swiped a UPS package containing $70 worth of boots from a residential porch in Winter Haven, about an hour east of Tampa. 

Police say the homeowner, 58-year-old Richard Lewis, tried to stop the duo - but Deboer allegedly stepped on the gas and slammed her getaway SUV into him, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Victim:  Richard Lewis, 58, is fighting for his life after he tried to stop a thief from swiping his daughter's Christmas gift but was run over

Lewis' wife and mother watched in horror as he flipped onto the hood and windshield, falling onto the sidewalk and hitting his head on the pavement.

'She hit him —  she hit him with her car!' a frantic eyewitness is heard telling a 911 dispatcher,WTSP reported. 

'He's bleeding really bad. Can you just send an ambulance?' 

The victim's daughter, Katie Ingram, says her dad suffered bleeding in his brain and nearly lost one of his legs in the December 24 incident, WTSP reported.

'Every day is a process for him,' Ingram told the station. 'He has a lot of recovery to have to do.'

'It's so trivial, just the whole thing,' she added. 'It's unbelievable that somebody could do that.'

Police found Deboer and Spiker a week later, on New Year's Day, after a tip led to her arrest at a nearby Budget Inn.

The boyfriend gave police a 'full confession' of the incident and agreed to be a witness, the Sentinel reported. 

Deboer is facing charges of attempted murder, burglary and petty theft in the incident. 

Both Deboer and Spiker have been arrested for methamphetamine possession before, according to the newspaper. 

She has at least 16 prior arrests in Polk County alone, according to the Sentinel.

Overall, she's been arrested at least 100 times, WTSP reported.
