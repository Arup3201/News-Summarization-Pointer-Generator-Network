Navy Secretary Ray Mabus sent the letters to the admirals which are considered to be career-ending reprimands leaving all three seeking retirement

Three more Navy admirals have been reprimanded in connection with the Fat Leonard bribery scandal after they accepted expensive gifts in exchange for Navy secrets but none will face criminal charges, the Navy said.

The widening 'Fat Leonard' scandal  has seen senior sailors implicated in a long-running bribery scheme that included rewards of prostitutes, Lady Gaga tickets and payoffs in Southeast Asia.

So far, the massive bribery scandal has cost the government $20 million and the admirals censured represent the highest-ranking officers to be punished in the case so far.

Navy Secretary Ray Mabus sent censure letters to Michael Miller, Terry Kraft and David Pimpo, and they are considered to be career-ending reprimands leaving all three seeking retirement. 

The reprimands could even affect their ability to claim benefits after they displayed  such 'poor judgment and a failure of leadership in prior tours,' Mabus said.

According to Navy officials, the entire case stems from an ongoing federal probe into bribery and fraud involving Navy contracts for port services in southeast Asia. 

Leonard Glenn Francis, a Malaysian contractor known as 'Fat Leonard' because of his size, pleaded guilty in federal court in San Diego to buying off U.S. military officials.

The  contractor at the center of the scandal pleaded guilty to fraud charges last month, admitting to bribing officials with cash, Lady Gaga tickets, prostitutes, Cuban cigars and Kobe beef.

Censure: Rear Admiral Michael Miller is currently a special assistant to the superintendent of the US Naval Academy and faces censure

He confirmed that he presided over a decade-long scheme involving tens of millions of dollars in bribes, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said Francis, CEO of Singapore-based Glenn Defense Marine Asia, obtained classified information that allowed the firm to overbill the military at least $20 million.

He charged them for port services such as food, fuel and garbage disposal.

All of the admirals improperly accepted gifts, two 'improperly endorsed a commercial business,' and one solicited gifts and services when they were stationed in the Pacific region in 2006-2007.

And all of the officers reprimanded were in high-ranking positions.

Each were punished for their conduct while assigned to the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan in a corruption scandal that has shaken the American navy. 

The corruption scandal has shaken the American navy, with several officers pleading guilty and another arrested this month in the case

Several Navy officers and officials, including a captain and a retired lieutenant commander have also have pleaded guilty to federal charges, while others await trial.

Francis has acknowledged bribing officials with more than $500,000 in cash and luxury goods worth millions. 

The goods included spa treatments, top-shelf alcohol, designer handbags, furniture, watches, ornamental swords and handmade ship models, according to court documents.

In exchange, Navy officers re-routed ships to ports owned by Francis and helped him boost his business.

He now awaits sentencing. 

Meanwhile, another former high-ranking civilian contracting officer for the Navy was arrested last week on a conspiracy charge.

He faces allegations that he accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars along with travel and the services of prostitutes for getting Navy contracts for GDMA.

The Navy has canceled all contracts with the company.
