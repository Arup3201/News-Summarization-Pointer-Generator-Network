Dai Greene's Commonwealth title defence is over after the former world champion failed to make the 400 metres hurdles final.

The 28-year-old took gold in Delhi four years ago but was unable to make it out of the heats at Hampden Park on Wednesday morning.

Greene, crowned world champion in 2011, has barely raced this year due to injury and that lack of fitness showed as he tailed off dramatically towards the end of the race.

Not good enough: Dai Green didn't qualify but Richard Yates made it through as fastest loser

Trailing: Greene was disappointed but said he already knew he may not have been good enough

The Welshman began strongly enough but faded badly down the home straight, crossing the line fifth in 50.36 seconds - way off his personal best of 47.84 secs.

Greene told BBC One: 'I knew I was playing catch-up from a few months ago.

'I didn't expect to be here but my mindset did shift a bit and I wanted to make the final but ran out of steam, sadly it wasn't to be.

'I was provisionally selected for the European Championships but I don't think I'll make the squad now.

'I'm not fit enough really. It has been frustrating but I'm happy to have given it a shot and the support I have had has been fantastic, so thank you.'

Greene's absence is another blow for Wales, who lost 2010 bronze medallist Rhys Williams before the Games after he was charged with an anti-doping violation.

The only home nations representative in Thursday's final will be Richard Yates after the English runner qualified as a fastest loser in 49.80.
