Online bargain hunters are expected to splash out £900,000 a minute today – with sales peaking at 7.57pm between Coronation Street and EastEnders.

Retail experts say now is the ideal time for people to take advantage of Christmas discounts on the net while remaining confident their gifts will arrive before the big day.

They predict a record 113 million visits to web stores on Monday, with total spending up 16 per cent from last year.

This will make ‘Cyber Monday’ Britain’s biggest internet shopping day on record.

The Tesco Direct website has already seen an 80 per cent increase of visitors to their site in comparison to Cyber Monday last year.

Asda say visitors to their site have increased by 50 per cent from last week, and their best-sellers are PS3, Xbox and Polaroid LED TV.

Royal
 Mail has opened ten temporary parcel sorting centres to cope with 
today’s expected flood of online orders, while Amazon has hired an extra
 15,000 people.

Games consoles such as Sony’s new PlayStation 4 are among the items topping families’ wish lists.

Not too busy? Today at the Amazon Distribution Centre in Rugeley, Staffordshire, staff appeared to be in control

Sales: Over 400 members of staff at the firm's mammoth warehouse could be seen picking items off shelves to meet Christmas orders

Packaged up: Millions of orders were predicted to be made on the site today - the busiest online shopping day of the year

But with the PS4 retailing for £349 and a supply shortage predicted, many could be disappointed. 

According
 to Royal Mail, Colchester, Lincoln, Brighton, Norwich and Swansea are 
set to be the leading destinations for online purchases sent by post 
this year.

Visa said online
 sales using its cards are expected to hit £450million today.

Although some analysts predict a rush between the soaps, Amazon say they are bracing 
themselves for a 6pm spike.

'The expected peak in sales at 6pm on 
Cyber Monday is interesting as traditionally sales have spiked later in 
the evening. In fact, in 2011, sales peaked at 9.20pm,' said Xavier 
Garambois, vice president of EU Retail at Amazon.

Last year Amazon.co.uk saw more than 
3.5 million items ordered on the site on Cyber Monday at a rate of 
around 41 items per second.

Sales: Christmas shoppers, pictured on Oxford Street last year, will spend £72.2billion this year - with a third of that spent online

That
 meant a delivery lorry packed with Cyber Monday orders left one of 
Amazon's eight fulfillment centres every two minutes and 10 seconds.

For last year's Cyber Monday, Barclaycard's online consumers spent an average of £57 per transaction.

Products that saw the biggest increases in spending last year were electronic stores - up 66.5 per cent - online family clothing stores - seeing an increase of 35.4 per cent and online department stores - up 31.5 per cent.

However, a survey commissioned by 
Virgin Media suggested just 5 per cent of Brits will purchase the 
majority of their gifts today.

According to the study of 2,000 UK adults, more people will wait until Christmas Eve than will buy online on Cyber Monday

It
 was found that 7 per cent of those asked will leave their web shopping 
until the day before Christmas, while another 7 per cent of respondents 
will wait until after December 25 to buy gifts in online Boxing Day 
sales.

The busiest shopping day on the high 
street often falls two days before Christmas Day, with Monday December 
23 and Tuesday December 24 expected to draw peak numbers of shoppers 
this year.

Total Christmas sales will be worth £72.2billion, the same as £351 per person, a 2.1 per cent rise on last year the Centre for Retail Research predicts. A third of that total figure will be online, they say.

Shoppers will spend a total of 400 
million hours shopping online this December, putting it on track to be 
the biggest ever year for online shopping.

John
 Lewis' online director Mark Lewis said the growth of online sales can 
be attributed to an increase confidence in internet shopping.

He said: 'Shopping habits have changed in the past few years.

'Customers are more comfortable purchasing via mobiles and tablets, and there is better connectivity.'

Not satisfied with record sales on Monday, some researchers are predicting a middle Cyber Monday on December 9.

Credit experts Experian expect more than 110 million visits to shopping sites on the day - saying it may even eclipse Cyber Monday.

The company say the average customer will spend eight hours browsing, researching and buying presents online this December - a 7.5 per cent increase year on year.

'This Christmas is going to be the 
biggest ever in terms of online retail visits and December 2013 should 
be the first month that the UK reaches the three billion benchmark for 
visits to retail websites,' said James Murray, digital insights manager 
at Experian Marketing Services.

Research
 by retailer BrandAlley showed 88 per cent of buyers thought a gift must
 be 50 per cent off it's recommended retail price before they would 
consider it a bargain.

81 per cent said they expect retailers to be on sale all year round.

Peak: Amazon say they are expecting a peak in sales towards the end of the day when people get home at work - at about 6pm

Figures suggest online shopping 
generally is up 10.1 per cent in 2013 - compared to 2012, according to 
Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of all card transactions in the
 UK.

Meanwhile, some of the
 country's biggest shops have begun their January sales more than a 
month early in a desperate bid to boost pre-Christmas sales.

In previous years, stores have held off 
heavy discounting into Boxing Day but they have been forced to act this 
time round to entice cash-strapped shoppers.

Shoppers will spend a £147 million pounds on Secret Santa gifts for work colleagues this year, new research reveals today.

They'll splash out £7.10 on average, with socks and novelty mugs topping the uninspiring list of presents.

Nearly one in 14 shoppers will buy deodorant for a colleague this Christmas, the study found.

The
 survey of 2,000 adults showed nearly a third of the nation will take 
part in the gift-giving craze, with one in three considering it a 'great
 British tradition'.

One in four take advantage of the game's anonymity to buy their colleagues inappropriate gifts.

The
 survey from the British Heart Foundation found some jokers even fix the
 present-swapping ritual to stir things up between office rivals.

The decision to cut prices follows an unexpected slump in high street sales over recent months.

Display windows in the country’s premier shopping destination, Oxford Street, London, are among those filled with sale signs.

Clothing outlet H&M is offering customers up to 50% off, while department store Debenhams has dropped some of its prices by almost third.

Jeweller H Samuel is offering items at half price, Topshop is advertising its flash sale and U.S. clothing chain Gap is running up to 40% off selected items.

Others cutting prices include Mango, Miss Selfridge, Aldo, BHS, Dorothy Perkins, River Island and Esprit.

The Metropolitan Police urged internet Christmas shoppers to exercise caution while making their purchases to avoid falling victim to fraudsters.

Its new Cyber Crime Unit has put together a check-list for people buying on the web.

Detective Chief Inspector Jason Tunn said: 'These are simple tips to keep safe while you shop online for your gifts for friends and family.

'The last thing anyone needs is for their details to be compromised by cyber criminals and online fraudsters - especially during the Christmas period.

'Hopefully these safeguards are easy to follow and can be implemented even by those with limited computer skills.'

The tips include installing protection on one's computer with anti virus or full security suite products as well as not clicking into links sent out by unsolicited spam or phishing emails.

Also suggested is using a credit card instead of a debit card - credit cards may offer increased protection, and being wary of unsolicited mail asking consumers to visit sites for cheap deals on hard to get items.

These may contain links designed to compromise a person's computer and steal their credentials.
