An elementary school bus driver decided she was 'done' and walked off the job, leaving more than 50 Texas children stranded on the side of the road. 

The unnamed driver was taking students home from Barrow Elementary School in Brazoria when she stopped the bus on the side of County Road 724 and walked off last week. 

The children on the bus were stranded for more than a half hour before a backup driver arrived on the scene to take them home.

The driver, whose name has not been released, said she was 'done' and has since resigned from her job

After she left the bus on the side of County Road 724 last week, the children were stuck for about 30 minutes

When the driver stormed off just three stops into the route, she left the keys in the ignition. 

Her abrupt stop also caused some of the children - ranging from preschoolers to sixth graders - to fly forward into the seats in front of them. 

Some children were so upset that they cried to the point of becoming ill, KHOU reported. 

Haleigh, a fifth grader said: 'She was driving and she slammed on the brakes really hard and she unbuckled her seat belt and she was like, "I'm done!" and she just walked off the bus.'

One student reported seeing a girl with 'throw up going all down her side' and a boy 'shaking his butt off'.

Before she left the kids, the bus driver was talking on her phone and said: 'I'm done. I can't take it anymore'

The Columbia-Brazoria Independent School District released footage of the entire incident and claims the driver pulled over and left because her passengers were being wild, KPRC2 reported. 

In the video, it appears like a male student throws something.

The driver then asks another student to hit an emergency button.

After the bus is stopped, the driver calls someone and says: 'You need to send somebody to get this bus and these kids.

'I'm done. I can't take it anymore.'

The driver, who worked the Barrow Elementary route for more than a year, has resigned. 

Some parents want her to face charges and a criminal investigation is ongoing. 

Parent Tonya Scott said: 'Why if you were having a bad day that morning, why in the world would you come to work?' 

'Why wouldn't you call in and tell them, "Listen I'm having a bad day, I'm going through some things I just can't deal with it right now." 

'Why would you put my kids' lives in danger? 

'I do think she needs to face charges.'

The district is accepting applications for bus drivers and bus monitors, according to its website.
