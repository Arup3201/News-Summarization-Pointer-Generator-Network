The late singer of legendary punk band The Clash, Joe Strummer, is to have a square in a Spanish city named after him following a petition from residents.

Officials in the city of Granada have said they have chosen a square which is to be re-named Plaza Joe Strummer following the campaign to honour the musician.

Strummer, who died in 2002, went to the city, in southern Spain, after he and bandmate Paul Simonon sacked the band's guitarist, singer and songwriter Mick Jones in 1983.

He also sings about Granada in The Clash's song Spanish Bombs, which is about the Spanish Civil War.

Maria Jose Aguita, a city hall spokesman in Granada, said: 'A square has been identified and now the proposal has to be approved by the committee of honours and distinctions,' The Guardian has reported.

'There was a popular petition for this to happen and the city hall accepted it.'

Every year since Strummer's death the city has held a musical commemoration for him.

Strummer's Spanish connections also go back to before The Clash, when he shared a squat in London with Spanish girlfriend Paloma Romero, who went on to become well-known as Palmolive, the drummer with The Slits.

Barcelona-based film-maker Nick Hall, who is working on a documentary on the singer's Spanish story, said: 'They would talk a lot about politics, the Franco dictatorship and [the poet and playwright Federico Garc√≠a] Lorca.'
