Rory McIlroy has won the Golf Writers' Trophy for the second time in three years following a stunning season that saw him claim two major championships and play a leading role in Europe's Ryder Cup victory.

The 25-year-old was the overwhelming choice for this prestigious award following votes cast by members of the Association of Golf Writers. In addition to his victories in the Open Championship and the US PGA Championship, McIlroy also won the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.

'First of all, I'd like to say a huge thank-you to the members of the Association of Golf Writers who have felt me worthy to receive this honour, I really do appreciate it,' said McIlroy. 'To win it for the first time in 2012 felt like a great achievement but to win again in 2014 is testimony to what has been a truly fabulous year for me.'

The Golf Writers Trophy was first awarded in 1951 and is given to the European who has made the most outstanding contribution to the sport during the year.

Previous two-time winners include Sir Nick Faldo, Padraig Harrington, Tony Jacklin, Sandy Lyle, Bernhard Langer and Annika Sorenstam. The only players to win it three times are Seve Ballesteros and Lee Westwood.

Martin Kaymer finished runner-up following his wins at the US Open and the Players Championship, with Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team rounding out a high-quality top three.

Added McIlroy: 'I think one of the nicest things for me is the relationship I have developed over the years on tour with the members of the AGW. I'd like to say, and I know all the players would agree, we appreciate the job you do in covering the sport – even if we don't always agree with what you write.'

Derek Lawrenson, Sportsmail's golf correspondent  and chairman of the AGW, reflected: 'It seems amazing that a man can win the US Open and the PGA Tour's flagship event and still not get a look-in for this award, but that sums up a remarkable year for European golf. 

'Congratulations to Martin Kaymer on his victories, to Europe's Ryder Cup team and also to Charley Hull, who is poised to win the Ladies European Tour Order of Merit at the age of just 18. But I don' t think too many people would argue Rory is a most worthy winner.'
