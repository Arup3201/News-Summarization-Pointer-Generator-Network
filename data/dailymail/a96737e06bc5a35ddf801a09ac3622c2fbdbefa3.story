Brad Cook appears to have disappeared without a trace and friend and relatives are at a loss to explain why or how.

Mr Cook, 22, left the house he shares with his sister Olathe, Kansas just after 10pm on October 20th without his cellphone and wallet.

About 10 minutes later, someone, possibly Cook, pulled his motorcycle into a strip mall parking lot in De Soto and left it there unlocked. Cook hasn’t been seen or heard from since.

On the lookout: Hunt for 22 year-old Brad Cook missing a week who vanished without his phone or wallet after spending the day with his dad

Distraught: Friends and relatives of Brad Cook have considered every possible explanation for his disappearance one week ago but can't understand what might have become of him

No trace: Searching has occurred on helicopter, on horseback, in a kayak and on foot have searched the area near where his motorcycle was found. Specially trained dogs have also scoured the area but didn¿t turn up a single piece of evidence

Cook, an Eagle Scout, worked for a construction cleanup company by day and attended business classes at Johnson County Community College at night.

'This is so abnormal for him,' said Jeff Cook, Brad’s father to the Kansas City Star. 'Each day we are worrying more, realizing that the odds probably aren’t working in our favor.'

Brad had spent the day with his father on the day he disappeared.

The pair rode their Harley-Davidson motorcycles to a Bonner Springs restaurant and spent the day riding around.

He texted his father at about 6:30 p.m. when he arrived home.

Dad: He had spent the day with his father, Jeff Cook, who said he did not notice any signs of depression before his son vanished

Hard worker: Cook worked for a construction cleanup company and took business classes at Johnson County Community College

No worries: His father, Jeff Cook, says his son seemed fine in the hours before he disappeared. He says Brad Cook wasn't depressed and none of his guns is missing

After going out with friends, Brad Cook returned home at about 9:30 p.m. and again texted his father. Brad Cook also talked to his girlfriend, and everything seemed fine.

About 10:10 p.m., his sister heard his motorcycle drive away. She checked his room and noticed his cellphone and wallet.

The phone didn’t show any recent calls or texts summoning him anywhere, Jeff Cook said.

Search party: Investigators and volunteers in a helicopter, on horseback, in a kayak and on foot have searched the area near where his motorcycle was found. Specially trained dogs have also scoured the area but so far nothing has been found

Odd: Brad Cook left home in Olathe on Oct. 20 without taking his cellphone or wallet. Shortly afterward, someone -- possibly Cook -- parked his motorcycle at a strip mall in De Soto. Cook hasn't been seen since and his bank shows no financial activity

When he didn’t return, relatives 
looked for him at around 1 a.m. that night when they found his bike near
a motorcycle shop and tavern.

Yet video footage shows he did not enter the tavern.

Investigators and volunteers in a helicopter, on horseback, in a kayak and on foot have searched the area near where his motorcycle was found.

Specially trained dogs have also scoured the area but so far nothing has been found.

Brad Cook wasn’t depressed, and none of his guns are missing. His bank also shows no financial activity.

'It’s like I have a 200-piece jigsaw puzzle in front of me, and I can’t even find two pieces to put together,' his father Jeffk said. 'We’re just distraught and don’t know what to do next.'
