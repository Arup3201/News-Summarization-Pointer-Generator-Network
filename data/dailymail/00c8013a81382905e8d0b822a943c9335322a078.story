Leader: Abubakar Shekau, head of Boko Haram, speaks in a video released by the Islamist group

More than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram have been married off to militants, according to a man claiming to be the leader of the Islamic extremists.

The man, who identifies himself as Abubakar Shekau, said the 219 girls, who were taken from  the remote northeastern town of Chibok in April, are now 'in their marital homes'. 

He added that they have all converted to Islam and have now memorised two chapters of the Koran.

He said: 'We have married them off. They are in their marital homes. Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?'

The claims, which were published in a video seen today, contradict recent claims by the Nigerian government that the girls would soon be freed.

They call into question whether talks between a Boko Haram faction and the government in neighbouring Chad will secure the girls' release.

The man claiming to be Shekau, who the Nigerian military says it killed a year ago, also denied there was a ceasefire.

Violence has continued since the government announced the agreement, raising doubts about how much influence Danladi Ahmadu, the man with whom the govenment is negotiating, has over the group.

Shekau also announced that Boko Haram, which means 'Western education is sinful', was holding a German hostage after kidnapping him from the northeastern city of Gombe in July.

Armed militants, understood to be linked to Boko Haram, kidnapped the teacher from a technical college.

Boko Haram has killed thousands of people since launching its campaign for an Islamic state five years ago. 

The terror group has attacked targets almost every day for weeks. Last week it seized control of Mubi, the home town of Nigeria's defence chief Alex Badeh. It was Badeh who announced the ceasefire.

Violence: A car bomb thought to be planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning, pictured above. A ceasefire was declared with the group two weeks ago

They robbed banks, burned down houses and hoisted their black flag over the Emir's palace, killing dozens of people and forcing thousands to flee, witnesses said.

A car bomb thought to be planted by Boko Haram killed at least 10 people at a crowded bus stop in Gombe on Friday morning, emergency services said.

The government has blamed the violence on Boko Haram's allied criminal networks that the group cannot control. There are believed to be several competing factions within the group.
