West Brom striker Peter Odemwingie has been fined Â£75,000 over of his conduct during the past two weeks but is now back available for first team selection.

The figure - two weeks' wages - is the price he has to pay for showing a complete lack of respect towards his club.

The Nigeria forward turned up at Loftus Road on transfer deadline day without Albion's permission but a proposed move to QPR collapsed.

Odemwingie has also apologised for his series of Twitter attacks against the club after having a transfer request rejected.

Albion said in a statement: 'West Brom have taken disciplinary action against striker Peter Odemwingie in respect of his conduct over the past fortnight.

'Odemwingie has accepted his punishment. He will now resume full training with his team-mates and is available for first-team selection.'

Accepting his punishment, Odemwingie added: 'I understand how my actions have been viewed and I want to apologise to the club and our supporters for any distress I have caused.

'I want to reassure everyone at the club and our fans that I will continue to give my all whenever I am selected. We have enjoyed a good season so far and I aim to play my part in keeping the club as high up the table as possible.'

Albion chairman Jeremy Peace added: 'This has been an extremely difficult time for the club and it was imperative that we dealt with such a serious matter both fully and correctly.

'We made our position very clear throughout - both privately to Peter and publicly. Peter has apologised for his conduct to me personally and the club and our supporters as a whole.

'He has accepted his punishment and promised to comply with all club regulations moving forward. It was important that we resolved this episode as expediently as possible to enable everyone to focus on the most important issue at this club - competing in the Premier League.'

Anger: West Brom fans are furious with Odemwingie

Baggies manager Steve Clarke, 
meanwhile, believes that Odemwingie's return to the squad will not cause
any disruption among the other players.

The Scot said: 'I don't think you can
say everything is back to normal because what happened, the whole 
episode, is something that didn't need to happen.

'(But) I'm really pleased the club have come out with this statement because it gives me the chance as a head coach to move on.

'That's what myself and the players 
need to do. We need to move on and concentrate on the football. I think 
it is important you try and keep your squad together. That's what I've 
tried to do.'

But Clarke admitted there may be some issues to resolve over time.

'It is difficult to comment on 
whether there is any hostility between individual members of the squad. 
They are in a different dressing room from me,' he said.

'Will Odemwingie's return have a destabilising effect? No it won't. I'm convinced of that.

Moment of madness: Odemwingie was filmed at QPR's ground as he tried to push through a move

'I couldn't deal with the matter 
until now. There was no resolution. Now there is a resolution we can 
move forward as a group of players. That is important.'

'I'm sure some of them will be happy 
the matter is resolved. In fact I'm hoping most, if not all of them, are
happy the matter has been resolved and we can move on as a group of 
players.

'How people take it personally is 
between Peter and the other people. The most important thing is that 
professionally we move on as a group of players.'

When asked to confirm if there had 
been a row between West Brom team-mates Steven Reid and Odemwingie, 
Clarke said: 'I don't know. If there has been a row between Steven and 
Peter, I'm sure it was an honest row.

'My biggest grievance on that one is 
if you are telling me someone in this building is letting stories out to
the press, that's more upsetting for me than Peter and Steven having an
exchange of words.'

Clarke is still to decide whether Odemwingie will be part of the squad for Wednesday's trip to Liverpool.

He added: 'That is still to be 
determined. I only got that statement half an hour before you guys so 
it's something we have to look at over the next two or three days.

'I'll involve him when I feel it is right to involve him.'
