His nickname is Mr Remarkableman, and painter and decorator Shaun Jones has certainly lived up to the accolade.

The 51-year-old successfully completed a two day lifting marathon and today claimed the astonishing world record for the number of squat lifts completed in 48 hours.

And it isn't the first time the father-of-three, who lifted huge weights of up to 230kg for 48 hours, has emerged as a record breaker as he currently holds the title for the fastest ever time of blowing up a hot water bottle until it bursts.

Two day triumph: Shaun Jones, 51, looks slightly red-faced during the 48 hour challenge lifting a staggering  576,745kg

Shaun, who has featured in auditions for Britain's Got Talent, settled into a pattern of lifting for three minutes, then resting for two to complete the task.

Over the two days the athlete lifted a staggering total 576,745kg.

The father-of-three, of Hoveton, Norfolk, already knew he had the pedigree to be a record-breaker after smashing the record for blowing up 100 hot water bottles with his mouth until they burst - in just one day.

Shaun, who lives with his wife Denise, 45, said: 'It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done.

And up! Shaun Jones started training for the event in 2004 and employed the technique of lifting for three minutes and resting for two

'There were some really dark moments and I nearly packed it in half way through.

'But my son was by side and he kept pushing me on - I don't think I could have done it without him.

'Loads of people came to cheers us on but they became a blur after a while.

'When you do such an arduous activity you tend to forget about your surroundings and just focus on the task at hand.'

Dedicated Shaun started training for the challenge, in 2004, by forcing himself to lift 30,000kg twice-a-day, seven days-a-week.

During the challenge Shaun lifted weights ranging from 230kg to 80kg by carrying out as many reps as he could for three minutes and then resting for just two.

The bodybuilder's effort was spurred on by memories of his late mother, who he completed the challenge in honour of by raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support.

Shaun said: 'It's an amazing triumph. It's been a long and arduous journey but it feels amazing to have finally finished.

'When I think about it, it is quite an unbelievable triumph. I did it for my mum Joan who died of cancer ten years ago.

'She was diagnosed with the disease and then died just two weeks later. Her passing taught me to relish life and every minute I was lifting the weights I was just happy to be alive.'

Shaun also holds the world record for blowing up a hot water bottle with his mouth until it bursts, with the fastest ever time recorded at just 18.81 seconds.
