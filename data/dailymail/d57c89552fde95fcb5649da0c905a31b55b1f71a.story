West Ham United striker Enner Valencia is clearly enjoying his last few days in Dubai.

The Ecuadorian international, who signed from Mexican outfit Pachucha shortly after the World Cup, posted a picture of himself to Instagram standing by the Burj Khalifa.

Valencia and his teammates are currently making the most of their FA Cup exit to West Brom by enjoying a mini training break in the sun.

Goalkeeper Adrian is also visible in the picture as the two players wear massive smiles on their faces ahead of their return.

Sam Allardyce’s side are set to arrive back in England on Tuesday as they prepare to face London rivals Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.

The east London club are currently on a poor run of form having won just one of their previous 11 games in all competitions, so Allardyce will be hoping the break will improve their fortunes
