The holodeck was a refuge for countless stressed crew members on the USS Enterprise, allowing them to escape the isolation of space.

Now researchers in the US are hoping to bring Star Trek-style technology to future long-duration space missions in an effort help astronaut's keep their sanity.

The 'Virtual Space Station' will act as a source of refuge for astronauts, as well as a computerised therapist that will check on their mental health through a series of programs.

Escape plan: The system will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that Oculus VR is developing, with the addition sounds and smells that could help change an astronaut's mood

Dartmouth College's Digital Arts Leadership and Innovation lab, or Dali, is currently creating the technology for the system with funding from Nasa.

The system will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that Oculus VR is developing, with the addition of sounds and smells that could help change an astronaut's mood.

It will 'trick the brain and make people feel as if they are in a variety of beautiful and calm settings, such as with their family at home or strolling on the beach,' Darmouth Professor Lorie Loeb said.

For instance, an astronaut's virtual reality program could include photos and video of their spouse and children, images of a beach, sounds of waves crashing, odours of saltwater and suntan lotion and a fan to simulate ocean breezes.

Houston, we have a problem: The system is designed to take care of an astronaut's mental health and prevent arguments on board long duration missions to the outer solar system

'We will use state-of-the-art virtual reality technology to help with the effects of isolation,' added Nook Harquail, the lead Dali designer and project manager on the project.

Imagine a miniature robo-surgeon sliding into your body through an incision in your stomach.

Once inside, the robot can expertly manoeuvre its way around the abdominal cavity, which has been filled with gas to make more room for work.

It can then perform procedures such as an emergency appendectomy or perforate a gastric ulcer.

This is the scenario being explored by Nasa in the hope that risky surgical operations in space will someday become a routine matter.

Working in collaboration with Virtual Incision in Lincoln, Nebraska, the space agency has developed a prototype of a remotely-operated fist-sized robot doctor.

The 0.9lb (0.4kg) has two arms fitted with tools to hold, cauterise and suture tissue, while its head is a small video camera.The camera feed is sent to a control station, where a human surgeon operates it using joysticks.

'While this work is in an early phase, the minimal invasiveness of this approach could enable its use in remote locations such as on a moon or Mars colony,' researchers wrote in a technical paper on the prototype.

'We're building all the new technology for this project and doing the interface and interaction design work from scratch.

'Dali lab is porting the existing content to a JavaScript game and creating both the content and framework for the virtual reality component.

'People have long thought that virtual reality can be therapeutic in addition to being used in gaming and entertainment.'

To upgrade the existing content, the Virtual Space Station system has been delivered for testing at the Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) Mission 3 which is starting today in Hawaii.

A team of six members will spend eight months in simulated Mars habitat – double the length of the previous longest Hi-Seas mission.

The Dartmouth team also plans to test the system in Antarctica, which is used as an analogue to long-duration spaceflights due to its isolation, length of stay and team composition.

The current Virtual Space Station system includes a suite of multimedia programs, including self-guided training on conflict and stress management.

The program also offers a six-session, self-administered depression treatment program guided by psychologist Mark Hegel, a professor at Dartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine and a co-investigator on the project.

Astronauts currently have audio and video access to psychologists only when communication links are available.

On longer missions like those to Mars, transmission delays will make real-time therapy problematic. Computer-based treatment offers an autonomous way to address these important problems.

The latest system allows astronauts to seek help confidentially on their laptops and monitors their mental health and conducts therapeutic sessions.

The program is designed for astronauts, but it could also be adapted to treat people on Earth. For instance, it could be used in rural areas where clinical help is limited or non-existent.
