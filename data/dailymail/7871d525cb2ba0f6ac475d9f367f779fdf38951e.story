So here he is everyone - Mr Denmark beat 45 other hot hopefuls - including the UK's Mr England, Mr Wales and Mr Northern Ireland - to win the coveted Mister World 2014 prize.

International Conference Centre in Torquay, Devon.

The world's most desirable man' is super-ripped carpenter Nicklas

Sadly though none of us have much of a chance with the winning fella as he has revealed to MailOnline that he is in a serious long-term relationship.

Nicklas says he has always been in shape but admits he had to work extremely hard to achieve his impressive physique for the competition.

'I've always been active. I love to play football, swim and hit the gym,' he says.

But in the run-up to the competition he had to see a personal trainer every single day stick to a strict diet of protein and vegetables only.  'No sweets, no chocolate, no ice cream. It was really hard.' he admits.

Nicklas, who describes himself as 'the 
happiest guy in the world', confessed that during his intense four-month
 prep he missed his favourite sweet treats.

Now that his jaw-dropping abs are no longer under intense scrutiny, he says he is looking forward to indulging in marzipan and nougat ice cream.

'After
 I won on Sunday night when it was all over, I needed to have some dirty
 food. I saw one of the Miss England girls eating Dairy Milk and I had 
to have some!'

'It was very overwhelming and is slowly starting to seem real,' Nicklas tells MailOnline.

'It feels amazing. I hoped to make it to the top ten but never in my wildest dreams did I think I would actually win. To be named Mr World 2014 is ridiculous. A dream come true.'

Nicklas entered the contest one random day when he was off from work.

'I hadn't heard of the competition before. I went on Facebook and saw something on Mr and Miss Australia. I thought, "Who are the Danish equivalents?". So I went on the website and applied myself.

'They came back to me after more than a year and said Denmark hasn't been awarded a spot in the 2013 contest.

'But then when Denmark was awarded for 2014, they asked if I was still interested. I went for interviews and beat 100 other Danish guys to become Mr Denmark 2014.'

The final of the event was broadcast on YouTube and saw Nicklas take the top prize

'This has been the greatest experience of my life, it's been like a rollercoaster ride'

Nicklas has now won prize of $50,000 USD (just short of £30,000), but he says he has no idea what he's going to do with it just yet, as his priorities right now are travelling the world and philanthropy.

'It means more to me than buying fancy things with money. I'll be doing a lot of public appearances and taking part in humanitarian missions and charity work. I'd love to go to Haiti where I can use my carpentry skills to help rebuild some of the damage even just for a couple of days or a week. That would be a dream come true.'

Work aside, Nicklas is hoping to go on a lads' holiday to Malta with new friend Mr England, Jordan Williams, where Mr Malta, Bjorn Demicoli, can show them around.

'I met some great contestants. I'm like brothers now with some of the other boys, like Jordan. We'll be keeping in touch,' he says.

So what is it about him that impressed so much? Mr Denmark says it was just him being himself.

'I consider myself the happiest person on the planet,' he says.

'I've always been told I have a really good attitude, and every day is a gift in my mind. I'm also a bit loud, but they must liked it!

'This has been the greatest experience of my life, it's been like a rollercoaster ride. They don't give you too much information and keep you on your toes, wondering how you're doing.

'When you don't get picked to give interviews you feel like you're behind or not good enough. And the physical aspect is tough.'

Contenders had to pass and impress during various rounds including Sports Challenge, Talent Award, Fashion & Style, Multii-Media and most recently Extreme Challenge.

Each round earns points which are added to the interview round, and along with stage presence marks, all points are added together to realise a winner.

Finalists spent the day working with the UK Royal Marine Commandos taking on one of the world's toughest roles for their Extreme Challenge.

They were put through their paces by top commando instructors, undergoing a series of extreme challenges designed to test the physical strength and mental determination needed to be a true champion.

The best took on the assault course used by all Marine Commandos during training, and the best of the best took on the infamous Mudflats course to find the last man standing.

'The Extreme Challenge was the hardest day of my 
life. I was pushed beyond my limits and actually threw up,' says Nicklas.

'It's not all about having big muscles, it's about determination, strength and mental power. They really put you to the test.'

Each round was judged by carefully selected experts in the field, such as Marshal Richie and his team at the Royal Yachting Association for the sailing round.

Interviews were judged by Mr World 2013 Francisco Escobar, two previous holders of the Miss World title, a musical director, stage director, choreographer and a stylist.

The final of the event, sponsored and run by the Miss World Organisation, was broadcast on YouTube and saw Nicklas take the top prize.

His
 strong performance throughout the competition added to his good looks,
 strong personality and great character made him the perfect Mister World, say organisers.

Emmanuel Ifeanyi Ikubese from Nigeria came second, while Jose Pablo Minor from Mexico came in third.
