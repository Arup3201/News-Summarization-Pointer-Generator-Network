Honey Boo Boo shared a hotel bed with her sister's childhood molester and Mama June, her uncle has claimed. 

Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson told the National Enquirer that he saw his nine-year-old niece Honey Boo Boo, whose real name is Alana Thompson, cuddling her mother and Mark McDaniel during a  trip to Cherokee, North Carolina in September.

McDaniel, 53, is accused of repeatedly molesting Honey Boo Boo's older sister Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, now 20, when she was just eight.

McDaniel, then Mama June's boyfriend, served 10 years behind bars and was released in March, and he has been rumored to be seeing the 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' matriarch again.

'Targeted': Honey Boo Boo, pictured with her mother Mama June last week, shared a bed in a hotel room in September with the man who molested her older sister, her uncle has claimed

Anger: Lee Thompson, also known as Uncle Poodle, claimed he saw the girl sharing a bed with McDaniel and her mother. He said Mama June spoke in graphic detail about her own sexual relationship with the man

'I'm disgusted with June for not protecting Alana from Mark,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer. 'This guy can't be trusted. He needs to be locked up and have the key thrown away.'

He claims that McDaniel traveled with him, his partner, June and Alana to a casino in Cherokee on September 12 for a weekend trip.

While there, the five stayed in the same room with two queen-sized beds for the two couples, while Alana slept on the floor, he told the magazine.

But when he woke the next morning, he saw that the youngster was in bed with her mother and McDaniel and 'it looked like they were cuddling', he said.

Accused: Mark McDaniel served 10 years in prison for child molestation and was released in March

There is no suggestion that anything sexual happened in the hotel room, the Enquirer pointed out, but Uncle Poodle added: 'I wouldn't be surprised if he's targeting Alana.'

On the trip, June introduced McDaniel as her 'gay friend' to avoid speculation that she was cheating on her husband, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, Uncle Poodle said.

Sugar Bear - who is Uncle Poodle's brother - thought they were in Atlanta at the time, he said.

But June and McDaniel's relationship was obvious to anyone who looked, he added, because they were kissing and hugging the whole time. 

After sharing a room with the others for the night, McDaniel and June rented their own room for several hours - and when June returned, she bragged they had just had sex.

'She went into graphic detail... and she was doing it right in front of Alana,' he said.

Since the scandal emerged two weeks ago - and TLC canceled the show - Uncle Poodle has said he will fight for temporary custody of the young girl if Mama June does not end the relationship with McDaniel.

Sources told TMZ that he has researched the ground rules for winning temporary custody, while he said himself and his fiancé are getting a new, larger apartment with a spare bedroom. 

Snubbed: He added that June's husband, Sugar Bear (pictured), thought they were in Atlanta at the time and that she lied that McDaniel was her gay friend. Sugar Bear and Mama June have since separated

Hurt: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell has spoken out about how hurt she feels that her mother is seeing the man who assaulted her when she was a child. Anna told cops in 2003 that he had sexually abused her

The sources say that Uncle Poodle will not ask for permanent custody because he would like to see Sugar Bear eventually care for his daughter when he gets back on his feet financially.

Other reports have suggested that Uncle Poodle is trying to get his own reality TV show.

At age nine, Alana is a year older than her sister Anna was when she was abused by McDaniel in the trailer he shared with Mama June.

Anna told police in 2003 that he abused her for months in 2002  - sometimes while sister Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, then three, was in the same bed.
