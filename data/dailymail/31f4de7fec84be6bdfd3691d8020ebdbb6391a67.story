Everyone knows that too much sunbathing can cause skin cancer.

But now research suggests that, in moderation, sunbathing could actually be good for people’s health.

A new study has revealed that it could prevent heart attacks.

Sunbathing could reduce the risk of heart attacks, new research suggests

It shows that cardiovascular disease is more severe in patients deficient in vitamin D, known as the 'sunshine vitamin'.

Although people are advised not to overdo it because of the risk of skin cancer, the latest finding backs up previous studies suggesting sunshine is good for the heart.

In the largest analysis to date, vitamin D deficiency was identified in seven in ten patients undergoing coronary angiography - an imaging test used to see how blood flows through the arteries in the heart.

It was associated with higher prevalence of coronary artery disease, with a 32 per cent higher occurrence in those with the lowest levels.

There were also almost 20 per cent more severe cases affecting multiple vessels among those with less of the nutrient.

A progressive increase in heart disease was found according to the severity of vitamin D deficiency.

People who are deficient in the sunshine vitamin - vitamin D - are more likely to have severe coronary artery disease

Patients with the lowest levels of vitamin D had nearly double the rate of clogged arteries as those with normal levels.

Cardiologist Dr Monica Verdoia, of Eastern Piedmont University in Novara, Italy, said: ‘Present results suggest vitamin D deficiency to be the cause rather than the consequence of hardening of the arteries.

‘Although evidence of benefits with vitamin D supplementation in cardiovascular outcomes are still lacking, strategies to raise natural vitamin D should probably be advised in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.’

Presenting her work to an American College of Cardiology meeting in Washington, she said vitamin D deficiency is an independent risk factor for heart disease. But it is still not clear whether adding vitamin D supplements may help reduce that risk.

Her researchers evaluated amounts of the nutrient in 1,484 patients who were considered to have heart disease.

The extent and severity of their heart disease was measured by a scanning procedure that determines the degree of artery blockage.

Dr Verdoia said eating foods rich in vitamin D such as fish, cereal and eggs and moderate exercise outdoors should be advised in healthy people as well as those with heart disease.

This is because the nutrient boosts the immune system as well as reducing inflammatory processes that lead to illness.

The researchers estimate more than half of U.S. adults are vitamin D deficient, with the highest rates among African Americans and Hispanics.

In the UK vitamin D deficiency is likely to affect at least half of white adults, up to 90 per cent of the multi ethnic population and a quarter of all children.

Vitamin D is being studied for its possible connection to several diseases and health problems including diabetes, high blood pressure, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune conditions, bone disorders and some types of cancer.
