With 100,178 passengers expected to fly on Christmas Day, London's Heathrow Airport is making an effort to ensure that no one misses out on their festive holiday feast.

Travellers will be treated to turkey, sage and onion stuffing, and Christmas pudding in the form of three specially created boiled sweets. 

Aptly named Boarding Bon Bons, the treats have been designed to perfectly recreate traditional Christmas dinner flavours.

Just before the Queen takes to the nation’s TV screens there will be an estimated 16,677 Heathrow passengers in the air during the traditional Christmas lunch time between 1pm and 3pm.

This year, Heathrow will become the first airport in the world to offer its passengers a festive twist on this tradition with Christmas dinner sweets that can be enjoyed at 30,000ft.

The treats were developed alongside one of the UK’s leading independent confectionary creators.

The Christmas pudding has hints of brandy butter, raisin and Christmas spices, while the turkey and sage and onion stuffing sweets taste surprisingly like a real Christmas meal.

Normand Boivin, Chief Operating Officer at Heathrow said: 'With a huge number of passengers set to fly from Heathrow this Christmas, we are giving merry travellers a festive send off as they embark on their holidays.

'We wanted to bring to life the warm and exciting feeling everyone gets on December 25th and what better way to make sure flyers don’t miss out on the most exciting moment of the day than by recreating the quintessential Christmas dinner.

'We tried a number of different flavour combinations, including cranberry sauce, mince pies and honey glazed carrots, but found that turkey, sage and onion stuffing and Christmas pudding really evoked the taste and sentiment of Christmas.'

Heathrow’s Boarding Bon Bons will be handed out by the airport’s passenger ambassadors across all five terminals from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day.
