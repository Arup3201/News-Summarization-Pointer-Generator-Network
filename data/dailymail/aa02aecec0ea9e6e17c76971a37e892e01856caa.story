Muhammad Ali is loved across the world, but his three visits to London cemented a special bond with the British public.

Over the space of three years, Ali won each of his fights against the best Britain had to offer, starting with his first clash with Henry Cooper in 1963. 

Despite being dropped by Enry's 'Ammer in the fourth round, Ali - then known as Cassius Clay - won by stoppage in the fifth, just as he had predicted.

Ali returned to the capital three years later for two fights in the space of three months. Having won the world heavyweight title against Sonny Liston, he made a third successful defence in his rematch with Cooper at Highbury, then home to Arsenal.

In August, he fought at Earls Court Arena, knocking out Brian London in the third round.

Away from the ring, however, Ali was photographed at various London landmarks as he prepared for his three fights. Here, Sportsmail takes you back through the scrapbook to a golden age in heavyweight prizefighting.
