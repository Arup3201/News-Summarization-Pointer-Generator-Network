Helmut Sandrock, the German football federation’s general secretary, told Bild: ‘We’ve spoken with them about it, that they could hold off [applying for] Euro 2024 and support our application. 

In turn we’d forego the Euro 2020 games and support England’s bid for Euro 2028.

‘Giving up our application for the three final matches in 2020 is only on the table if we can be sure to get the 2024 tournament.’
