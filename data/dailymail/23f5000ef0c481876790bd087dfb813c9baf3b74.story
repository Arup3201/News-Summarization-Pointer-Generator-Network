Sergio Aguero appeared to be looking back to the beginning of his football career as he posted an image of himself with two Independiente jerseys on social media.

The Manchester City striker, who has scored 19 goals in the Premier League so far this season, posted the image to his Instagram account on Thursday evening. 

The 26-year-old joined the Argentinian side in 1997 as a nine-year-old and became the youngest player in the division to make his debut.

The Buenos Aires-born star moved on in the summer of 2006, making a name for himself in European football when he moved to Atletico Madrid.

Now at Manchester City, Aguero is one of the best strikers in world football and his goalscoring record this season is supporting this label. 

He will be looking to add to that record on Saturday as Roberton Martinez's Everton are the visitors to the Etihad Stadium.
