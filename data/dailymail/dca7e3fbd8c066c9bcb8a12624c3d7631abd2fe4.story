Double leather, extreme knitwear, pink tie-dye and men sashaying down the catwalk in crop tops? It could only be Men's Fashion Week.

This morning saw the fourth London Collections: Men kick off in the capital and, so far, the AW14 offerings have been nothing short of outlandish.

The
 London event sees 60 menswear 
designers showcase their wares for the coming season in front of 
assembled press, stylish celebrities and buyers from over 45 countries - and is a showcase 
for what is a Â£6.5bn fashion industry.

Top of the crops! Men's Fashion Week kicked off with a bang in the capital today and Astrid Andersen's show was full of crop tops and one shoulder leotards

Today saw the likes of Astrid Andersen and Topman Design showcase their collections to fashion enthusiasts including David Gandy, Nick Grimshaw and Dermot O'Leary.

Astrid Andersen's 'athletic' collection was full of grey sweats, one-shoulder leotards, camel tones and long-haired models donning furry bombers.

The vibe was very much an urban one with American football style jerseys gracing the catwalk. 'If high fashion designers had a say in the NBA,' wrote fashion editor Nick Carvell.

Jaw dropping fashion: Designs by Bobby Abley at the MAN show at London Mens Fashion Week were literally mouth opening

Over at Topman Design, thick wool and chunky roll necks were the order of the day - which were a hit with GQ's Most Stylish Man of 2013, Nick Grimshaw.

'I loved the giant oversized sort of Margiela jumpers with roll necks,' he told the men's fashion bible after the show.

Matthew Miller sent punky models down his catwalk complete with lip and nose rings and, once again, layering and knitwear were heavy hitters. Slimline biker jackets with oversized back zips added an androgynous effect.

Hotly anticipated Jonathan Saunders sent models down his catwalk in head-to-toe colour and confirmed that layered-up bombers are going to be bang on trend next season.

'An exceptional collection from Jonathan Saunders for AW14. Glitter and harlequin designs. Yum,' said fashion blogger Simon Glazin.

The eclectic shows were watched by stylish A-listers, David Gandy, Dermot O'Leary and Tinie Tempah and the best is yet to come - over the next three days, weâ€™ll see seasonal offerings from big hitters Alexander McQueen and Burberry (which FEMAIL will be live streaming right here for your viewing pleasure).

And with fashion week comes super-fashionable parties. Last night Domenico Dolce and Stefano Pilati kicked off the week in style at their Bond Street store where Kylie Minogue danced the night away.

Mulberry and Tommy Hilfiger are hot tickets for the week and Superdry will be hosting the biggest party of LC:M, which will include a catwalk show showing both men's and women's collections followed by a star-studded party hosted by man of the moment Nick Grimshaw.
