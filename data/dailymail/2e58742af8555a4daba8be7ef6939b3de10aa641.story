The photo of Ben Kopp, who died in Afghanistan in 2009 was found on dating site Plenty of Fish

Photographs of a fallen U.S. soldier have appeared on a number of dating websites five years after his death  in Afghanistan.

Ben Kopp, from Minnesota, died while serving as an Army Ranger and his mother  posted several pictures of her son online to honor his sacrifice and keep his memory alive.

But Jill Stephenson was devastated to learn that the photographs of her son have been used fraudulently, Fox9 reports.

The deception came to light after a complete stranger found a profile on Plenty of Fish and sent a screen grab to Ms Stephenson. 

The profile picture for the account DavidMerced35 is actually a photo of Ben.

'It made me sick to my stomach, to be honest,' Ms Stephenson told the news channel. 'They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery, and in this case, I don't think it is.'

Ms Stephenson also fears for the safety of those who the user may be communicating with under false pretenses.

'He's luring them with a photo of a man who looks nothing like him, so they think they are going to meet this young, good-looking guy and they could show up and not know who he is,' she said.

The picture of Ben has also appeared on other dating sites - including DateHookup.com and OkCupid.com - and a number of Army Rangers and Ben's friends have contacted those sites to try and find answers.

'One of them I did see is dated November of December of 2013, so we're going back almost a year,' Ms Stephenson added. 'This guy has been at it for a while, and it's time he stopped.'

Ms Stephenson has spoken with an attorney to see if there are any legal steps that can be taken against DavidMerced35. So far, the PlentyofFish profile has been taken down.

Ben, who died in action in 2009, was honored for the multiple life-saving organ donations his death made possible at the Rose Bowl parade in 2010 and has also had a scholarship created in his name.

Since Fox 9 first revealed that Ben had been misrepresented online, Ms Stephenson has received a stream of letters from women who shared similar stories of meeting DavidMerced35 onlilne.

'There's so many women he's duped, not just one,' she said. 

Ms Stephenson was also greatly disturbed when she read of letters to learn that some of the women had sent the fraudster posing as a military man a care package.

'To get a woman to believe he's serving his country and he's not - and getting them to send care packages, wow,' she added. 'That's appalling to me.'

One of the women named as Yolanda wrote to Fox 9 News to say that she met DavidMerced35 on Plenty of Fish and even spoke with him on the phone. However, she said that whenever she tried to meet him face-to-face, he always had an excuse.
