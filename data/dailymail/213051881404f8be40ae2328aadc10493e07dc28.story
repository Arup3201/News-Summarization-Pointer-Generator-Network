A teenage belly dancer said to have been paid for sex by former Italian prime Silvio Berlusconi has given birth to a baby girl.

Karima El Mahroug, also known as Ruby the Heartbreaker, was just 17 when she was invited to Berlusconi's infamous bunga bunga parties where women were paid to strip and dance seductively for him.

Prosecutors allege that she was also paid to spend the night with him. As a result he is currently on trial for having sex with an underage prostitute as she was a minor at the time.

Moroccan born Miss El Mahroug, now 19, gave birth to a girl five days early at a private hospital in Genoa - her due date was Christmas Day.

The baby's father, nightclub boss Luca Risso, said the baby would be named Sofia Aida and added: 'She is well and with her mother.

'My happiness is indescribable. At the moment it's a bit difficult to say who she looks like - I hope she looks like her mother as she is so beautiful. Maybe she will get her brains from me.

Denials: Berlusconi denies that he had sex with Miss El Mahroug and claims that he is the victim of Left-wing prosecutors

'Ruby is so happy. The birth was over 
very quickly, it lasted just five minutes and went well. My parents and I
have always liked the name Sofia while Ruby has always liked Aida - 
when she is older the baby will decide which name to use.'

Billionaire
Berlusconi, 75, denies that he had sex with Miss El Mahroug and that he abused his 
power as premier to try to cover up the case - he is said to have used 
his position to negotiate her release when she was arrested for theft by
police in May 2010.

Miss El Mahroug also insists that nothing happened between her and Berlusconi but has 
revealed he gave her money, jewellery and a car for attending the 
parties he hosted in his villa at Arcore near Milan.

If
found guilty, Berlusconi faces a total of 15 years in prison - three 
for paying for underage sex and 12 for abuse of power.

In his three 
ongoing trials and previous cases, he has always denied wrongdoing, 
claiming he is the victim of Left-wing prosecutors and judges who are 
persecuting him for political reasons.
