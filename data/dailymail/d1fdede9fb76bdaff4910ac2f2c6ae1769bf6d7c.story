A huge mound of rotting rubbish has been piling up outside a home after it became a dumping ground for fly-tipping residents when the tenants moved out.

The giant pile of litter, which includes dozens of black bin bags, wooden pallets and food waste, has been growing outside the property in Acocks Green, Birmingham, since the tenants left over a month ago.

The rubbish mountain is so high that it blocks the majority of the front downstairs window and completely blocks the path to the front door. It also spills out onto the pavement of the residential road.

Environmental officers from Birmingham City Council have ordered that the rubbish is to be removed  by Thursday and plan to question neighbours over who is responsible after sifting through it

Environmental health officers from Birmingham City Council have now ordered that the rubbish is removed in full by Thursday and plan to question neighbours over who is responsible.

Officers have already painstakingly sifted through some of the bin bags and have traced where much of the rubbish originated from.

Councillor John O'Shea alerted the authority to the rubbish mound after receiving a complaint from a resident living on the road last week.

He told MailOnline: 'The rubbish was piled high, I have never seen anything like it at a property before.

'I alerted the environmental health department and the landlord has been given seven days to move it.

'It appears the rubbish may have started piling up there from as far back as five months ago. 

'Two thirds was building waste, rubble and plasterboard but the front of the pile was mainly black bag waste and looked mostly like household waste such as food containers and cans.

'In the landlord's defence, I don't think the black bag waste has come from that house.

'The council's environmental health team did some bag searches and have traced the rubbish to other houses so those residents will be getting a visit.

'I have not idea why they have done that though, we have weekly collections for them. 

Mr O'Shea said those who were fly-tipping at the property were ruining it for other residents in the area and said the council wouldn't hesitate to prosecute. 

'By and large our policy is to educate first but if you are somebody who is dumping on the street then we will enforce and that can involve fines and prosecution.

'We don't have a major problem with fly-tipping but there are always little spots where people try to dump stuff.

'This is the worst case I've seen in quite a while.'

He added: 'It's about loving where we live. The vast majority of residents look after their homes, they don't rubbish or drop litter, it's just a small number who for whatever reason decide they don't want to live like others.

'It ruins it for the others who want to keep the street nice. It's not on. You know you're dumping rubbish where it shouldn't be. There's no excuse for it, it's a criminal act.

'Ultimately if you don't change your behaviour we will fine you and prosecute.'

Neighbours claimed the previous tenants had left the property in a bad state and the landlord had decided to gut the property as well as carry out building work.

Retired driving instructor Tom Maguire, 74, who lives a few doors down, said: 'The rubbish has been piling up over the last few months.

'Once people see bin bags there they put more on them and it has just spiralled out of control.

'It has been an eyesore for far too long and I was getting worried that it was going to get even worse so I am glad it looks like the message has finally got through.'

Another neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'It has been in that state for over a month since the last family who were renting the property left.

'The pile has been getting higher and higher.

'I think the property was left in a bad condition and it looks like the landlord has stripped the property inside and has carried out some building work.

'The building waste is still there but our main concern was the household rubbish as we feared there could be a rat infestation.

'Fortunately the household rubbish has been cleared now.'

After being given seven days notice to move the rubbish last Thursday, the landlord has made some headway in removing the waste. The black bin bags have now been cleared but building waste still remains at the site

Part of the mound of rotting rubbish has been removed, although the landlord still has some waste to clear 

Birmingham City Council said the rubbish was brought to the authority's attention last week and said it took 'swift and robust action' to rectify the problem.

The council said the landlord has been given seven days to clear the rubbish, meaning it must all be removed by Thursday.

Some of the rubbish has already been removed from the site, although much of the building waste remains outside the property.

Councillor Lisa Trickett, cabinet member for a Green, Smart and Sustainable City at Birmingham Council, said: 'We are all saddened by images of fly tipped waste as this is a blight on our city and those responsible should be ashamed of their actions. They clearly have no pride in our city.

'We are working with the local businesses and communities, to create a better understanding of how they should dispose of their domestic waste, and are actively tackling fly-tipping by investigating the unscrupulous people who consider dumping waste at the roadside to be acceptable. Let me be clear, it is not.

'I know that every resident, business and visitor is horrified by this kind of anti-social behaviour and we would ask anybody that witnesses those responsible to come forward to help us bring them to justice.

'We will use all the powers available to us to take enforcement action and prosecute anyone who does fly tip in Birmingham – regardless of whether it is garden waste, a piece of furniture or anything else – and would encourage anyone with information on any cases to contact us in the strictest confidence.'

A builder who was working at the house today refused to comment or give the name of the landlord.

The pile of rubbish started with old building materials and waste and gradually grew as fly-tippers dumped household bin bag. Tom Maguire, a neighbour, said: 'The rubbish has been piling up over the last few months'

Councillors said the rubbish is a 'blight on our city' and said fly-tippers 'should be ashamed of their actions'
