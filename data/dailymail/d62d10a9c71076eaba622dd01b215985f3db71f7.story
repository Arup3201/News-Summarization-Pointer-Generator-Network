Billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is being sued by a crisis management company that claims he hired it in 2011 to deal with the scandal over his friendship with Prince Andrew.

Sitrick & Co accuses the financier of failing to pay £65,000 fees for advising him after the Duke of York stayed at his £30million mansion in Manhattan. 

Andrew was seen strolling through Central Park with Epstein in a scandal that caused the prince acute embarrassment and forced him to step down from his role as Britain's trade envoy.

Sitrick claims Epstein, who was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for underage prostitution, agreed for the firm to provide 'consulting advice and public relations services' over the friendship.

Epstein was one of the wealthiest and well-connected men in America until he was jailed for 13 months in 2008 for soliciting girls for underage prostitution.

But despite this Prince Andrew stayed friends with him for three more years until they were seen together.  

The California Superior Court papers filed by Sitrick & Co. say: 'On or about March 11, 2011, Epstein entered an oral agreement with (Sitrick) to provide consulting advice and public relations services concerning Epstein's relationship with Prince Andrew.'

According to the New York Post, Epstein counter-sued and claimed he has never been properly served as his main residence is the British Virgin Islands, but a judge has ruled that he can be deposed no matter where he lives.

Sitrick & Co. are among the highest profile crisis management and PR companies in the US and have represented the likes of Paris Hilton and X-Files star David Duchovny.

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles sought their help in 2002 during the abuse scandal. 

Prince Andrew's close ties to Epstein were made clear when a photograph emerged of him with Virginia Roberts, one of the girls he is said to have used as a sex slave.

Some 40 women since then have in total come forward claiming that Epstein abused them too, though almost all settled their cases.

Amid further damaging revelations it emerged that the Duke of York stayed at Epstein's home in Florida and flew with him in his private jet

His ex-wife the Duchess of York had even been bailed out by Epstein with £15,000 when she got into debt.  

Lawyers for Epstein and Sitrick did not return calls for comment.
