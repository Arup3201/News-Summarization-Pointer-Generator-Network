A man has been arrested over the murder of a teenage girl who disappeared more than 20 years ago.

Johanna Young was 14 when she went missing from her family home in Watton, Norfolk, on December 23 1992.

Her partially clothed body was found, covered in scratches and lying face down in water, on Boxing Day.

Today, Norfolk Police said a man in his 40s from the Watton area had been arrested.

A spokesman added: 'The man remains in custody and police inquiries continue.'

Johanna's father Robert Young told Mail Online: 'We are hopeful now there has been an arrest and that this might be able to bring closure.'

Mr Young, and his wife Carol recently made a fresh appeal for information on the 21st anniversary of her disappearance.

Mrs Young, 58, said: 'We do celebrate Christmas but itâ€™s never quite the same.

'We tried to carry on for the sake of our other children, and as a family we just continue the best we can, but Johanna is in our thoughts all the time.'

Mr Young, 60, described Johanna as 'full of fun and always up to tricks'.

On the night she went missing, the family presumed Johanna had stayed at her boyfriendâ€™s parentsâ€™ home because it was a foggy night.

Her alarm clock went off at 6am on Christmas Eve because she was due to go on her paper round. Her family realised she was gone and called the police.

Officers searched the town and surrounding countryside in the hope of finding her alive.

After her body was recovered, investigations targeted local men and although three people were arrested and questioned, no charges were brought.
