Channel 4 News chief correspondent Alex Thomson was barred from hosting the Rory Peck awards over fears he had had contact with Ebola patients 

A news correspondent was barred from hosting an awards ceremony for aspiring journalists because of organisers' fears over his contact with Ebola patients while reporting in west Africa.

Alex Thomson, chief correspondent for Channel 4 News, has recently returned from reporting in Sierra Leone. 

The reporter was due to host the Rory Peck awards at the BFI in London last night but was dropped from the role.

Ebola has killed around 5,000 people so far, with most of the deaths confined to parts of west Africa. 

Sierra Leone is one of the worst hit areas for the disease. 

Thomson was due to present the Rory Peck awards alongside Sky News special correspondent Alex Crawford.

But there were concerns that because the disease has a 21 day incubation period Thomson could put people at risk because he would be shaking hands. 

He denied claims that he had stepped down from hosting the awards on Wednesday. 

He wrote on Twitter: 'I did not pull out of presenting the Rory Peck Awards - they dropped me.'

The correspondent was instead replaced by colleague Lindsey Hilsum who has also been out in Sierra Leone previously in 2006. 

The Rory Peck awards were launched to recognise journalists who take risks to report difficult stories from around the world. They were set up in 1995 in memory of Rory Peck, a freelance cameraman who died in Moscow while working. 

A spokeswoman for the Rory Peck Trust said: 'The Trust is committed to ensuring that it does not reinforce any confusion over how Ebola is spread - we understand the medical issues and at no stage did we think that there was an infection or safety risk in Alex presenting the awards.

However, Alex and Channel 4 News are running a no-touch policy which we respect, but which would have made his job as presenter impractical and, possibly, distracting for the audience. So after discussion with Channel 4 News, we thought it would be easier for Lindsey Hilsum to present instead.' 

Last night's award for news went to 23-year-old Pacome Pabandji  for his reports on the conflict in the Central African Republic.

And six North Korean cameramen, who chose to remain anonymous and appeared under the name Team Mindeulle, received the award for features for their work exposing life in Korea. They were praised by judges of the awards for 'risking their lives to tell this story.'

Ben de Pear, editor of Channel 4 News, last night tweeted a picture of Thomson and Alex Crawford at the awards. He wrote: 'Alex's @alextomo& @AlexCrawfordSky both Ebola heroes and TV news stars #rorypeckawards'

A spokeswoman for the awards said they were 'happy' to see the presenter at the event. 

Alex Crawford, who was due to be Thomson's co-host has previously spoken out about the dangers of creating panic in reports of Ebola. 

In a recent interview with the Guardian she said: 'I think the fear in America, Britain and everywere else is out of proportion because they will get cases of Ebola, absolutely. But will it spread like it has done in Liberia? Really unlikely. You need to be alert, but do you think it’s going to take over and kill half of Reading? No.'

Mr Thomson has reported from locations across the world, including appearing here in the Middle East
