A ridiculously good looking tradie and a cute puppy have proven to be a powerful combination when it comes to social media.

Ben Henderson, of Melbourne, became an overnight Internet sensation after a photo of himself holding his newly adopted pet went viral.

Pet's Haven Animal Shelter uploaded the image on their Facebook page last week and it has since gained 17,444 likes, 84 shares and 1,515 comments.

While those who couldn't resist Mr Henderson weren't shy in expressing their interests, his finacee was quick to let the world know that her man is taken.

While those who couldn't resist Mr Henderson's blue eyes weren't shy in expressing their interests, his finacee Alisha Howell (pictured with her husband-to-be) was quick to let the world know that her man is taken

The genetically-blessed couple got engaged last year and will get married next month

Ms Howell quickly posted a photo of her engagement ring in the comments with the caption: 'Sorry ladies he put a ring on it!'

Pet's Haven Animal Shelter posted the endearing image on February 8, captioned: 'Raffa and his new dad.'

But the focus soon became more about Raffa's  dad rather than the eight-week-old puppy as it didn't take long for the photo to circulate.

The image was then flooded with comments such as: 'Where can I adopt him? the dogs cute too', who cares about the dog right now' and 'I want both of these'.

However 21-year-old Alisha Howell, who got engaged to Mr Henderson in 2013, quickly posted a photo of her engagement ring in the comments with the caption: 'Sorry ladies he put a ring on it!'

The genetically-blessed pair will tie the knot next month. 

Little Raffa, who was adopted at eight-weeks-old, has been receiving a lot of love at his new home

Mr Henderson, 20, told Daily Mail Australia he's still in shock with his new-found fame.

'It was all unexpected and I've been getting heaps of friend requests [on Facebook],' he said.

'It's all a bit of fun and I really don't think anything of it. We're just happy we have a new addition to our family.'

And the dog?

'He's doing really well and settling in nicely,' Mr Henderson said.

'I'm just glad that the huge response over all this has raised awareness on animal adoption. It's important to give them a home because each one deserves it.'

This comes in the lead up to Love Your Pet Day on February 20 as experts say owning a pet has been shown to give health benefits to their human owners.
