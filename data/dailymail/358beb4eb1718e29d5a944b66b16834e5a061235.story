Manny Pacquiao has received apologies from American newspapers and websites who fell for mock-up photograph of him apparently dressed in a T-shirt insulting Floyd Mayweather.

With the mania for their mega-fight in Las Vegas spinning out of control, the picture went viral.

It depicted the real video-game PacMan gobbling up a dollar sign representing Mayweather’s nickname, Money.

‘We’ve been had,’ admitted the publishers of the image. ‘We’ve been photo-shopped.’

It appears that the photograph was faked by a company marketing the garment, in red and yellow.

Beware more fraud, especially with tickets like gold dust for the night of May 2 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau in November last year
