The firm jaw, the determined look, the hint of a confident smile - features that would later inspire the millions he led to victory over Nazi Germany.

Taken when he was 18, these previously unseen images of Winston Churchill have emerged through the sale of an album belonging to a titled family which has chosen to remain anonymous.

The pictures, taken in 1892 when William Gladstone was prime minister and photography was still the preserve of the wealthy, show Churchill alongside his brother Jack.

The brothers take it in turns to pose with a terrier outside their Aunt Cornelia's home in Canford Magna near Bournemouth.

There is also a picture of the boys' 
mother Jennie, Lady Randolph Churchill. The American socialite, who was 
born in New York, leans elegantly against one of the property's columns.

Shortly after the pictures were taken, Winston fell 29ft from a bridge and almost died.

He had been chased by his brother and
a cousin and, not wanting to be caught, leapt for a tree hoping to slide 
down it, but fell instead.

He ruptured a kidney and was in a coma for three days. His father sent the best London doctors down to the coast to treat him.

It was as he lay recovering that Winston learned he had failed to get into the Royal Military Academy,  
Sandhurst for the second time. He got in at the third attempt.

The images showing his younger 
brother John - known as 'Jack' - are also of interest because his life 
was overshadowed by his elder brother.

Jack fought in the Boer War - where 
Winston worked as a journalist - and World War I and was mentioned in 
Dispatches in both conflicts.

During World War II he moved into 
No.10 Downing Street after his home was bombed in the Blitz by the 
Luftwaffe. He worked as a banker in the City of London and died in 1947.

The album of 150 images is being sold by auctioneers Bonhams on November 22 and it is expected to fetch £3,000.

A spokesman from the saleroom said: 
'Churchill is such an iconic figure that anything new about him always 
causes great excitement.

'In one of these photographs the 
young Churchill is striking the kind of confident pose that many years 
later would become familiar to millions of people round the world.

'And it is not too fanciful to see in these very relaxed early family images the inspirational leader he was to become.'

Within two years of these photographs 
being taken Churchill attended the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst 
where his adventures as an army officer and journalist began.

He travelled to Cuba and saw the Spanish fight the Cuban guerrillas and 
wrote about the conflict for the British newspaper, the Daily Graphic. It was while he was there that he acquired a taste for Havana cigars, which he would smoke for the rest of his life.

He also saw action on the North West Frontier of India and in Sudan.

While working as a journalist during the Boer War he was captured and 
made a prisoner-of-war before making a daring escape.

It was this escape which made him a minor national hero for a time in Britain, although instead of returning home, he rejoined General Buller's army and was among the first British troops to relieve the British at the Siege of Ladysmith and take Pretoria in South Africa.

Churchill was born at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire on November 30, 1874 to the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Marlborough.

His father was the charismatic and prominent Tory politician, Lord Randolph Churchill, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. His mother, Jennie Jerome, was an American socialite.

Rebellious by nature, Churchill generally did poorly at school which he started in Dublin. He later attended three independent schools: St. George's School, Ascot, Berkshire; Brunswick School in Hove, and then Harrow, where his military career began.

He eventually left the army in 1899 to take up politics. His political career began when he won the Conservative Party seat at Oldham in 1900, however having become disaffected with the party he joined the Liberals four years later.

As President of the Board of Trade in Asquith’s Liberal government he set up labour exchanges and unemployment insurance.

As Home Secretary in 1910 he improved safety in the mines and prevented the employment of child miners, although he disappointed radicals by deploying troops in Wales during a miners' strike.

Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940 when Britain was at war with Germany, following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain.

He died on January 24, 1965 and was given a state funeral.

Since his death, Churchill’s stature has continued to grow. He was recently voted ‘Greatest Ever Briton’ in a major BBC poll, beating Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Charles Darwin.
