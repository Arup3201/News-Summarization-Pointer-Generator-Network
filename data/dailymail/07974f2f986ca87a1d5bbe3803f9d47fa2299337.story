The traditional family structure with a father as the breadwinner and a mother who stays home to raise children is becoming increasingly uncommon in Britain.

Just one in five families fits the 'traditional' model which has become less popular over the past decade, research shows.

In Britain, 22 per cent of families were made up of a male breadwinner and a female who did not work in 2011, a slight decline from 23 per cent a decade earlier.

The research on modern fatherhood was conducted by the University of East Anglia, the Institute of Education and NatCen Social Research who surveyed 1,500 men across eight countries - France, Sweden, Greece, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Poland and Britain.

The results showed that the number of male breadwinners is declining across Europe - with Spain showing the biggest drop. This was attributed to the availability of part-time work and flexible jobs.

Dr Sara Connolly, from the University of
 East Anglia, said: ‘We are seeing not only a greater level of equality 
in economic provisioning between parents, but also a growth in new 
working models involving more part-time and other flexible forms of 
employment.’

A decade ago nearly half of all families were headed by a man, but figures from 2011 show that this has dropped to 28 per cent.

Greece fell from 46 per cent to 36 per cent, while Sweden and the Netherlands were shown to have the lowest number of working fathers.

Fathers were also surveyed on how their job affected family life.

More than a quarter of British fathers said they are always or often too tired after work to enjoy the things they would like to do at home with their family, and another 35 per cent said they often worry about work problems even when they are not in the office.

Dr Svetlana Speight, of NatCen Social 
Research, said: ‘This research shows that in the UK many fathers allow 
their job to undermine their family life.

'It suggests that there are 
lessons we can learn from countries like the Netherlands where fathers 
appear to have a better work life balance.’

Professor Margaret O’Brien, director of the Thomas Coram Research Unit, also said the research showed that many British fathers allowed their job to encroach on home life.

She said: ‘Nearly one-third of British fathers still work over 48 hours a week and a tenth over 60 hours a week.

‘If the coalition government is really serious about being family friendly it should sign up to the EU Working Time Directive, which will take pressure of British families and allow parents the choice of sharing work hours between them in a more balanced and modern way.’
