The Scout movement is to preserve the historic promise by its members that they will do their duty to God, its leaders said yesterday.

They bowed to pressure from secular lobbyists and offered boys and girls from atheist families the chance to make a special non-religious pledge when they sign up as Scouts.

But new recruits will continue to make the religious promise unless they ask for the atheist version.

Tradition: The original promise, written by Robert Baden-Powell, left, in 1908, will be retained by new recruits

The decision opens a gulf between the Scouts and the Guides, who earlier this year dropped all references to God and religion from the promises girls are asked to make when they join.

It was welcomed by church leaders, who praised the Scouts for ‘affirming the importance of spiritual life.’

The Scout choice to keep God in its main membership pledge follows months of argument over whether the country’s two biggest youth movements should continue to honour religion as one of their central principles.

Guide leaders said in June that their organisation’s longstanding demand that girls who sign up should promise to ‘love my God’ was ‘confusing’ about belief and ‘discouraged some girls and volunteers from joining us.’

Instead new Guides now pledge ‘to be true to myself’ and ‘to serve my community’.

But Scout officials said yesterday that following a 10-month consultation ‘the core Scout Promise remains in place and scouting remains fully committed as a movement that explores faith and religion as a core element of its programme.’

Oath: The Duchess of Cambridge accepts flowers from a local Scout in 2011. The reference to the Queen in the promise will be retained as well.

The decision opens up a new element of competition for recruits between the two organisations.

Although the Guides remain an all-female group, Scouts have accepted girls as members since the 1970s and now have more than 77,000 girls among 537,000 members.

The Scout Promise, which dates from the foundation of the movement in 1907, requires that new members declare: ‘On my honour, I promise that I will do my best, to do my duty to God and to the Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout Law.’

Different versions for the use of Muslims, Hindus and Buddhists have been available since 1960, although all have included a religious reference.

There are also versions for foreign members which allow them to pledge duty ‘to the country in which I am now living’ rather than to the Queen.

The new wording for atheists says: ‘On my honour I promise that I will do my best to uphold our Scout values, to do my duty to the Queen, to help other people and to keep the Scout Law.’

Scout Chief Commissioner Wayne Bulpitt said yesterday: ‘Throughout its 106-year history the movement has continued to evolve and today marks an important step in that journey.

'It also signifies the determination to become truly inclusive and relevant to all sections of society that it serves.

‘We are a values-based movement and exploring faith and beliefs remains a key element of the Scouting Programme. That will not change.’

Churchmen from the main denominations welcomed the move.

The Right Reverend Paul Butler, Church of England Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham, said: ‘As the recent national census demonstrated, we remain a faithful nation where the majority of families find identity and meaning in religious belief.

Opposition: Terry Sanderson of the National Secular Society said he preferred the Guide's approach`

‘In enabling people of all faiths and none to affirm their beliefs Scouting has demonstrated that it is both possible, and I would argue preferable, to affirm the importance of spiritual life and not to restrict meaning to arbitrary self-definition.’

Terry Sanderson of the National Secular Society welcomed the decision but said: ‘We think the Guides’ response to this issue was infinitely superior. They introduced a secular oath for everyone.

'This approach relieves young people of having to make a decision about what they believe at a time in their lives when maybe they haven’t decided.’
