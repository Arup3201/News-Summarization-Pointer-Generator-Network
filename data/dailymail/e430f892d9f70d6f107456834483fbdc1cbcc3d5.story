A mother-of-one with a cyst the size of a bowling ball on her uterus has overcome the debilitating condition to reach the finals of a curvy modelling contest.

Elisha Perez, 37, from Greenwich in Connecticut, USA, was misdiagnosed by doctors who thought she was suffering from IBS.

Over 15 years her condition continued to worsen, leaving her writhing in pain for hours at a time.

Elisha Perez was misdiagnosed for years by doctors who thought she was suffering from IBS, now the mother-of-one has overcome a debilitating illness to feature in the final of a lingerie competition

She found it hard to walk, could hardly eat and had to struggle throughout the day and night to sleep and was eventually diagnosed with Adenomyosis - for which there is no known cure.

After multiple consultations she decided to go ahead with an abdominal hysterectomy - the removal of her uterus and ovaries - to restrict the pain.

The procedure was painful and frightening for Eliza but since the surgery she has found a new lease of life and felt confident enough to enter herself into the 'Star in a Bra' competition by fuller-figure lingerie firm Curvy Kate. She's, of course delighted to find herself in the final.

Elisha, an administrative assistant, said: 'Every job I had I was in fear of losing because I was almost always late due to the fact I was incapacitated.

'I looked normal and healthy on the outside but inside I was losing a battle. By October 2012 I was in danger of losing a job for the third time and the pain was the worse it had ever been.

'After a trip to hospital and several large doses of painkillers - none of which worked - I accepted I would have to start the process of doctors, tests and medication again only this time I demanded certain things be done.

'Later that month after requesting an MRI I was told I had Ademomyosis and cysts on my ovaries, Adeno is a granular tissue disease - they don't really know what causes it and there's no cure.

'The uterus haemorrhages within the muscle and since it' in the muscle it doesn't shed, causing it to grow becoming larger and heavier.

'I was basically walking around with a small bowling ball in my pelvis. The weight of it was crushing my other organs and creating the digestive issues because the colon was in impinged.

'In the end they had to remove my entire uterus, ovaries and had to separate everything from my colon. I lost three organs including my gall bladder.

'One doctor also told me I was very lucky because had I waited much longer organs would have started to shut down.'

Now recovering from her the ordeal Elisha says her confidence - although a work in progress - is starting to come back.

She added: 'I feel like I get to start over - I was quite upset about feeling 'incomplete' as a woman and no longer having the option to make another baby which I really wanted. 

She was diagnosed with Adenomyosis - for which there is no known cure, and had multiple consultations

'But then I looked in the mirror, the colour in my face had started to look healthier and I'm able to sleep through the night. It's the little things most people take for granted that I had to focus on.

'My daughter Ava is my blessing and my miracle. She has helped me to stay focused and love myself just as she does.

'It was that which gave me the energy to take a few minutes to put on eyeliner or lipstick or even put a little effort into my hair. I look in the mirror and I don't see less of a woman, I see a warrior, a survivor and a woman who still has much to explore.

'I decided to enter the competition because I loved that it was about real women & curves all shapes and sizes. I thought, how cool would it be to see a model I can relate to so why not me?

'I don't see women who are my shape and size and Curvy Kate has such beautiful designs so  I started to envision myself as a Pin Up for Curvy Kate.

Elisha decided to go ahead with an abdominal hysterectomy to restrict the pain, and she has now been chosen as a finalist for fuller-figure lingerie firm Curvy Kate's annual 'Star in a Bra' competition

'It's an opportunity of a life time - I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. Quite frankly I was feeling rather confident and I felt that this would help me to continue focusing on the positive and moving forward. I want to be a role model why not a lingerie model as well.'

A spokesman for Curvy Kate, said: 'The world is made up of different shapes and sizes and we feel not all sizes are represented.

'We want all our customers to feel that they are being catered for and that being above a D cup and curvy is something to be proud of.'

Voting for the next Star in a Bra begins today and ends at midnight on November 19.

The winner will be announced on November 21 and will gain a 12-month modelling contract with Curvy Kate and a year's supply of Curvy Kate lingerie.
