Wayne Rooney has revealed the inspiration behind his cartwheel goal celebration in England's 3-1 win against Scotland - his son Kai.

In an Instagram post on Friday, the Manchester United striker explained that his five-year-old boy asked him to pull off the acrobatic manoeuvre if he found the back of the net at Celtic Park.

Rooney uploaded a video of Kai doing cartwheels in the Wembley tunnel prior to the Three Lions' 3-1 victory against Slovenia, adding that his son had been doing them on a regular basis.

Wayne Rooney was banned by Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United from celebrating goals with a cartwheel in case of injuring himself.

The incident occurred after the Red Devils' striker scored his side's winning goal in their Carling Cup semi-final second leg against local rivals Manchester City in January 2010.

And although the England skipper celebrated his first strike against Gordon Strachan's side in more traditional style, he listened to his son's wishes after beating Craig Gordon late in the second half.

Rooney wrote on Instagram: 'Lots of people asking why I did a cartwheel to celebrate my goal against Scotland. It was because my son Kai has been doing them a lot lately and asked me to do one, here he is doing one in the tunnel before the @england Slovenia game!'

Rooney took his two sons out with him as he collected a special golden cap from Sir Bobby Charlton last week, recognition for reaching 100 international appearances.

The 29-year-old marked the occasion by scoring a penalty, then added his 45th and 46th goals for his country against the Scots on Tuesday. 

Those goals moved Rooney above Jimmy Greaves in England's all-time list and to within three of Charlton's record haul of 49 goals.

Speaking after his brace north of the border, Rooney said: 'I'm just enjoying my football at the minute. I've always loved playing for England. 

'I hope that continues and if that means beating the record I'll be delighted.'  

Rooney celebrated his second strike in the dying moments of the match with the cartwheel celebration

Although it was Rooney's goals that helped seal victory against the Scots, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave Roy Hodgson's men the lead with a fine header after 32 minutes.

The Arsenal midfielder converted a pinpoint cross from club team-mate Jack Wilshere, nodding the ball beyond David Marshall and into the bottom corner.

Rooney doubled England's lead just after half-time, recating quicker than the home defence to give the visitors a two-goal advantage in Glasgow.

Hull City's Andrew Robertson halved the deficit seven minutes before the final whistle with a well-taken goal, beating ex-Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster at his near post.

But it was Rooney who had the last laugh, finishing off a slick passing move to put the result beyond doubt with just five minutes remaining.
