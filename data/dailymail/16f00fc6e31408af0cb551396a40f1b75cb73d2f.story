Jason Harrison was shot dead by Dallas police officers last June

A body-camera video of the June 2014 police shooting of a mentally ill Dallas man has been released, showing the chilling moments that led to the man's death.

The family of Jason Harrison, a 39-year-old man who suffered from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, released the graphic video Monday to show the public how the police handled the mentally ill man. .

The video clip, the first body-camera footage released of an officer-involved shooting in Dallas, WFAA reports, shows two officers responding to an Oak Cliff home on June 14, 2014. 

Harrison's mother answered the door after contacting police for help with her son. Family members told WFAA that it was not the first time police were called to help control the man.

However, what happened next was far from what anyone expected.

The body-camera footage shows Harrison's mother stepping away from the home as she told the police, Officers John Rodgers and Andrew Hutchins, that Harrison was 'bi-polar and schizo' and 'off the chain.'

The 38-year-old is seen standing in the doorway twirling a screwdriver in his hands. The officers, noticing the potential weapon, yell for the man to drop it as his mother is heard in the background screaming 'Jay! Jay!' 

Harrison appears to take a step away from the doorway and the two officers immediately fire at the man. In the video, a stun gun is seen in one of the officer's holsters but was never used to control Harrison.

Harrison stumbles toward the garage, covered in blood, and falls as his mother is heard yelling 'You killed my child!' 

The officers reportedly shot the man five times. 

'It was the most heartbreaking experience in my life,' Harrison's mother, Shirley, told NBC.

'To stand there helpless, he's helpless. I couldn't help him. To be gunned down right before my eyes.'

In October, Harrison's family filed a wrongful death and violation of civil rights lawsuit against the officers, arguing that Harrison, who the family says was not a violent person, posed no threat to the cops, NBC reports.

Step: Harrison is seen here taking a step away from the door, officers immediately draw their weapons and shoot the man several times 

Stumbles: Harrison stumbles toward the garage, covered in blood, and falls as his mother is heard yelling 'You killed my child!'

However, the officer's attorney, Chris Livingston, says the men feared for their lives, The Dallas Morning News reports. 

Livingston said that killing someone with a screwdriver would be 'pretty easy. It'll only take one blow.'

Police say that the video confirms the officer's claims of self-defense. Police note that the situation unfolded quickly in a small space and the officers were protecting themselves, the Morning News reports.

'The officer has literally less than about three seconds to react to this situation,' Keith Wenzel, a tactical trainer for law enforcement agencies, told WFAA.

Harrison's family obtained the video from the department as part of the lawsuit. And both Harrison's family and their attorney, Geoff Henley, said the video should spark reforms on how police interact with the mentally ill, the Morning News reports. 

'When you're dealing with somebody who is mentally ill, you're not supposed to agitate,' Henley told the station.

'You're not supposed to move fast... you're not supposed to inflame.' 

Heartbreaking: Harrison's mother, Shirley (photographed), described the incident as 'the most heartbreaking experience in my life' 

Duty: The two officers, John Rodgers (photographed) and Andrew Hutchins are back on duty with the Dallas Police Department 

Criticism: The police department has received criticism on its Facebook page, since the video was released, from those who believe the man was wrongly killed 

'Hello, ma'am:' Here, one Facebook user described the officers as 'serial killers with badges' 

Respect: As the department's page has been riddled with critical comments, some are calling for people to 'respect our police officers' 

Wenzel told WFAA that the officers were too close to Harrison to use a stun gun. He said that if the officers moved back, creating enough space to use the stun gun, the suspect could have attacked his mother.

'...well people would say the officer should have stood between the mother and the son -- which is what he did.' 

The police department has received criticism on its Facebook page, since the video was released, from those who believe the man was wrongly killed 

Dallas police have completed their investigation into the incident and the case has been turned over to the district attorney's office.

The case has not been heard by a grand jury yet, and both officers are back on duty.
