A musician famous for singing at Philadelphia Eagles games had his prosthetic leg stolen while performing in the parking lot.

Sonny Forriest Junior was singing to fans outside the team's stadium, Lincoln Financial Field, last night for the Eagles' game against the Giants.

But during his performance an intoxicated fan in her 20s wearing Eagles clothing approached him before making off with his leg.

Forriest said 'people were partying and enjoying themselves' but he now felt 'really low' - his leg was found hours later on a train by a Subway conductor and returned to the entertainer 

Forriest, who has collaborated with acts such as Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, told NBC Philadelphia: 'I was singing a song and a young lady came up and snatched my leg off my chair and took off. 

'She broke my microphone, but I said "that's alright baby, we're having a good time", but then she disappeared.

'People were out there partying and enjoying themselves, but she took my leg. It made me feel really low.

'Everybody knows me throughout the city and I am just down there having fun.' 

The 57-year-old, who was operating a motorised scooter, said he had lost his leg when was injured in military service and then in the streets and had used a prosthetic leg since 1995.

Despite the theft Forriest Jr. remained in good spirits and even performed a few songs to the cameras. He also had a message for the person who snatched his leg.

“It’s a shaaaame, the way you mess around with old men!” he sang. “It’s a shaaaame the way you hurt me!” 

Philadelphia Police investigated the incident and the entertainer's leg was found hours later on a train by a Subway conductor.

Investigators said they planned to examine transit station surveillance video to try to identify a suspect. They said it appeared that three women took part in the theft. 

This is not the first time Forriest has had his leg stolen. In 2008, he appeared on the Jerry Springer Show in an episode that was titled 'These Two Broads Stole My Leg'.
