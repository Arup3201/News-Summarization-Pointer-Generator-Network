'Romantic, fearless, modern, confident,' is how Dani and Annette Felder summed up their SS14 collection.

The sister duo behind Felder Felder kicked off London Fashion Week this morning with an ethereal yet edgy aquatic-inspired collection.

Hemlines were short and cuts girly and flippy on dresses made of silk and neoprene in hues of blue. Waist cut-out detail featured on many, revealing a tantalising glimpse of skin.

With the water theme running throughout, obscure designs featured alongside more wearable pieces with bubbling patterns and high-shine fabric.

A psychedelic mini dress in
distressed stripes in fuschia, terracotta and aqua blue stood out. The 
Felder sisters say the piece is a reflection of the 'wondrous kaleidoscopic 
life which lives in the deepest corners of the sea'.

Pleated paperbag waistbands made a comeback on skirts made from brown plastic, like sweetie wrappers. On softer fabrics in cooler tones, the effect was almost shell-like.

Pearlescent and sheer organza was 
tailored into shirts, trouser suits and dresses. Seams were visible, as well as flesh underneath. A bra would be required to take them from
catwalk to street.

Indeed, the white organza trousers pictured here were much more sheer in real life than they appear - a very brave look.

The designer sisters were in a much more playful mood this season, experimenting with chiffon textures and creating an almost coral reef effect. The wonderful fabric features on mini dresses and tops in rose and white.

Tough, black sheer bodysuits and embossed leather played a more edgy note in the collection.

The beauty look was clean and shiny, all 
over. Models appears as mythical mermaids just surfaced from the ocean 
with wet and almost tousled hair by Johnny Engstrom and plump, dewy skin
by Mel Arter at Max Factor.

Celebrity fans sat front row, including Amber Le Bon, Zoe Hardman, Pandemonia, Kate Nash, Laura Whitmore and Natalie Massenet.

The smiling sisters, who call their collection 'timeless', skipped down the catwalk arm in arm to loud applause after the show at Somerset House.
