A spinoff from robotic space technology may someday help astronauts stay fit in space and help paraplegics walk on Earth, Nasa says.

The U.S. space agency and the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) have jointly developed a robotic exoskeleton called X1.

The 57lb device is a robot that a human could wear over his or her body either to assist or inhibit movement in leg joints.

Dual use: The X1 exoskeleton, currently in development, could help astronauts exercise in space and paraplegics walk on Earth. It is based on the technology behind Robonaut 2, the first humanoid robot in space

In the inhibit mode, the X1 exoskeleton would be used as an in-space exercise machine to supply resistance against leg movement.

The same technology could be used in reverse on the ground, potentially helping some individuals walk for the first time.

The X1 is based on the technology behind Robonaut 2, the first humanoid robot in space, which is currently working with astronauts aboard the International Space Station.

'Robotics is playing a key role aboard the International Space Station and will be critical in our future human exploration of deep space,' said Michael Gazarik, director of Nasa's Space Technology Program.

'What's extraordinary about space technology and our work with projects like Robonaut are the unexpected possibilities space tech spinoffs may have right here on Earth.

'It's exciting to see a Nasa-developed technology might one day help people with serious ambulatory needs to begin to walk again, or even walk for the first time.

'That's the sort of return on investment Nasa is proud to give back to America and the world.'

Nasa's Robonaut 2 aboard the International Space Station: The technology for the X1 exoskeleton was adapted from the Robonaut project

From the waist up, 27-year-old Sophie Morgan is every inch the pretty blonde girl-next-door. But from the waist down, with her legs encased in £90,000 of motorised carbon-fibre, she is RoboCop.

Sophie’s thumb manipulates a joystick built into the armrests of her suit, causing the legs to hiss and whirr into life, before she takes three slow but sure steps. Her face breaks into a broad grin.

Nasa's X1 prototype is not the only exoskeleton in development that could help disabled people walk again. Sophie is one of the first people in the world to benefit from a robotic exoskeleton called Rex.

Once in, the only movement needed is the strength to operate a small joystick, which instructs 29 micro-controllers within the machine to react within milliseconds. The user can move in all directions, sit down, and ascend and descend stairs.

It is this technology that will, arguably, mark the end of the wheelchair. But as yet there are currently just ten in existence and only 30 people have tried Rex.

Rex weighs nearly 6st and is relatively bulky, yet experts predict that within the next few decades the devices will be small and light enough to slip on under a pair of jeans.

Worn over the legs, with a harness 
that reaches up the back and around the shoulders, X1 has four motorised
joints at the hips and the knees, and six passive joints that allow for
sidestepping, turning and pointing, and flexing a foot.

There also are multiple adjustment points, allowing the X1 to be used in many different ways.

Nasa is examining the potential for the X1 as an exercise device to improve crew health both aboard the space station and during future long-duration missions to an asteroid or Mars.

Without taking up valuable space or weight during missions, X1 could replicate common crew exercises, which are vital to keeping astronauts healthy in zero gravity.

In addition, the device has the ability to measure, record and stream back data in real-time to flight controllers on Earth, giving doctors better insight into the crew's exercise.

X1 could also provide a robotic power boost to astronauts as they work on the surface of distant planetary bodies. Coupled with a spacesuit, X1 could provide additional force when needed during surface exploration.

Here on Earth, IHMC is interested in developing and using X1 as an assistive walking device. It has the potential to produce high torques to allow for assisted walking over varied terrain, as well as stair climbing.

'We greatly value our collaboration with Nasa,' said Ken Ford, IHMC's director and CEO. 'The X1's high-performance capabilities will enable IHMC to continue performing cutting-edge research in mobility assistance and expand into rehabilitation.'

The potential of X1 extends to other applications, including rehabilitation, gait modification and offloading large amounts of weight from the wearer.

Preliminary studies by IHMC have already shown X1 to be more comfortable, easier to adjust, and easier to put on than older exoskeleton devices.

Researchers now plan on improving on the X1 design by adding more active joints to areas such as the ankle and hip to increase the potential uses for the device.
