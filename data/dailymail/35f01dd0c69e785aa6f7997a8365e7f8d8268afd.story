 Arsenal players were put through their paces by Arsene Wenger on Saturday as they looked to put an unsatisfactory week behind them with victory against Everton.

The Gunners were beaten 3-1 at home by Monaco in the Champions League in midweek, all-but-ending their aspirations in Europe this season.

And they looked focused at London Colney ahead of the Premier League fixture with Everton on Sunday.

Jack Wilshere will be absent after he had a minor operation on his ankle, but other than that Wenger insists he has no extra injury concerns after Wednesday's defeat.

Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini could also return to action soon.

Wenger is open to embracing change and can turn the team into an effective defensive force again, according to former Double winner Bob Wilson. 

The manner of the performance against Monaco - which saw Arsenal punished on the break for what Wenger himself described as 'suicidal defending' - drew plenty of negative headlines and debate across social media, with Wilson calling for support of the manager and unity behind the team. 

Wilson, who was in goal when Arsenal battled to the 1970/71 Championship and FA Cup success, believes Wenger still has what it takes to find the balance needed to blend the attack-minded squad into an effective unit.

'Arsene believes his side has to entertain, win, lose or draw, that with the amount of money people pay they should go home and say 'what a great game, real value for money', but you can't always see that, so while his principles remain the same, he is always open to realising the game constantly changes,' said Wilson, speaking ahead of the London Football Awards, which will be held on March 5 to recognise the best of London football, attended by leading players, past and present. 

'I believe this squad has the potential to challenge the likes of Chelsea and Man City, for all of their salaries and transfer fees.

'This Arsenal squad are right on the brink.

'Arsene Wenger has assembled a squad which is now nearly perfect, there are virtually two players in every position and going forwards they have an embarrassment of riches.

'We just have to make sure victory is based on good defence.

'Arsene's principles are to always entertain and play this beautiful football to watch, but you need to make sure your defence is always secure, and that involves everybody from the goalkeeper out, so as soon as you lose possession every one of you becomes a defender immediately and have to win the ball back.'
