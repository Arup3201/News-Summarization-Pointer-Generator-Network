A flock of wartime homing pigeons that were fitted with mini parachutes and air-dropped into France were awarded bravery medals after bringing vital intelligence back across the English channel.Â 

The set of five valuable honours awarded to the birds will be shown on the Antiques Roadshow this Sunday and shed new light on the methods the Allies devised to spy on the enemy.

The birds were strapped into mini-parachutes and placed in small crates that were dropped behind enemy lines to be used by the French Resistance.

A corkscrew fan on the wooden crate unwound in the wind leading to the door to open automatically in mid-air, allowing the pigeon to drop to the ground.

The French attached coded messages about German military movements to the birds which flew across the English Channel with the precious intelligence.

But one chilling note that has emerged after 70 years was written in German and informed the British the French recipient had been shot for spying having been found with a pigeon.

Some 32 racing pigeons were awarded the prestigious Dickin Medal - the animal version of the Victoria Cross - for their acts of heroism in World War Two.

The Royal Pigeon Racing Association owns five of them. Its general manager, Stewart Wardrope, took them along to the BBC's Antiques Roadshow to show them off.

He also revealed the stories behind their award as well some of the other madcap inventions made by British boffins and used to gather intelligence using the birds.

These included a clockwork camera strapped to the belly of a pigeon that automatically took reconnaissance snaps of Nazi-occupied Europe before returning home.

Of the five medals due to be featured on this Sunday's Antiques Roadshow, two were awarded to pigeons that delivered important intelligence from Europe six times between them.

Another, named 'Beachcomber', brought back the first news of the disastrous landings at Dieppe in September 1942.

Most RAF planes took with them at least one carrier pigeon in the event of crashing behind enemy lines with no radio communication. A bird named, 'Dutch Coast', saved the crew of one downed plane by flying 288 miles in seven hours with an SOS that led to the men being rescued.

Mr Wardrope said: 'Thousands of racing pigeons were used by the Allies in the war and they saved lives and brought very important intelligence back from the French about the Germans.

'The British dreamed up all sorts of ways of getting them to the French Resistance.

'They strapped them in little parachutes so that they couldn't fly off and dropped them out of the planes over a pre-arranged position.

'Then there were problems with pigeons flying into the tail planes of faster aircraft so the British put the pigeons inside little boxes with a cork screw fan and the friction of the wind wound the fan which opened the box allowing the pigeon to drop out.

'Anybody caught with a racing pigeon in France were considered to be spies and were court martialled and possibly executed.

'The Germans had special teams called Hawk units based along the coast which were snipers and their job was to try and shot England-bound pigeons out of the sky.

'All the pigeons were interested in was getting home but they regularly had to fly through shot and fire to do that.

Some of the pigeons were even fitted with small cameras to bring back aerial photographs

'They returned to their owners who then made contact with the military and passed on the coded messages.'

The National Pigeon Service was set up in the war and involved over 200,000 birds being given to the armed services. Those that flew over Nazi-occupied Europe were part of the Special Pigeon Service.

In 1943 Maria Dickin, founder of the People's Dispensary of Sick Animals (PDSA) set up the Dickin Medal to honour the bravery of animals in the war.

The exact valuation of the five medals given on the Antiques Roadshow cannot be revealed until Sunday but as a collection they are worth thousands and thousands of pounds
