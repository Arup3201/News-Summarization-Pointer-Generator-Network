When you think of a drive-thru you normally expect to pick up a burger and fries.

But customers at Britain's first ever drive-thru bank can now withdraw or deposit money without leaving their vehicles.

The purpose-built Metro Bank opened in Slough, Berkshire, today, with the aim of speeding people through transactions and making tiresome queues for available cashiers a thing of the past.

Do you want fries with that? Metro Bank founder Vernon Hill was the first to try out the new drive-thru today

Chairman and founder, Vernon Hill, was joined in his car by his dog Duffy, as he became the first person to use the drive-thru facilities.

The branch in Farnham Road has two drive-through lanes, where customers come face-to-face with cashiers through their car windows.

The newest addition to Metro Bank's growing portfolio also has a full walk-in branch alongside.

It is the 18th Metro Bank branch to open in the UK in three years, with the company being the first new high street lender to open in a century.

Despite reported losses of Â£100 million 
pounds, the lender is trying to grab as many customers it can from the 
competing traditional banks.

Chief executive Craig Donaldson said the company is aiming to give customers choice and convenience.

The approach may well be working, with people queuing up outside the new Slough branch this morning before it even opened.

Mr Donaldson said: 'It's all about convenience for customers.

'Research tells you normal retail banking times are 8am to 8pm, so if that's when customers want to use it, banks should open then.'
