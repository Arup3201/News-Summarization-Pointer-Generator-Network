He is one of William and Harry’s closest friends and widely regarded as their ‘court jester’. But Guy Pelly’s latest outrageous stunt may well have proved a joke too far.

A promotional video for his London bar Tonteria features close-ups of semi-naked dancers ‘twerking’ – with Buckingham Palace as a backdrop.

It’s a choice of location that could put Pelly at odds with the Royal Family and has most certainly put him on the wrong side of the law – as filming outside Buckingham Palace without permission is illegal.

Neither Prince William nor Prince Harry were involved in the zombie-themed video, now on YouTube, featuring actors cavorting orgy-style near the Victoria Memorial outside the Palace’s famous gates.

Later, the bizarrely dressed dancers moved on to the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye and Harrods, where they were chased away by security staff who claimed they were scaring shoppers.

The mood portrayed in the video – filmed earlier this month – is not far removed from what actually takes place in Tonteria, a Mexican-themed bar where topless men wearing giant skulls patrol the club with sparklers.

A large bottle of champagne costs £28,000 and for guests who guarantee to spend at least £1,000 behind the bar, drinks are served by skimpily clad dancers gyrating to thudding music, and shots of tequila are delivered by an electric train suspended from the ceiling.

Friends of Pelly, 32, acknowledge the Stowe-educated entrepreneur was well aware that his choice of Buckingham Palace for filming was trading on his Royal friendships.

As The Mail on Sunday revealed earlier this year, Prince Harry is often ushered in and out of Tonteria via a discreet side entrance, and the club is where William hosted Pelly’s stag party in May before he married American heiress Lizzy Wilson.

One regular at the Sloane Square venue, present during the filming, said: ‘We broke a lot of rules and we are expecting the video to be banned.

Guy obviously knows people will assume he’s giving a cheeky nod to the fact Harry goes to his club.’

The filming location outside Buckingham Palace comes under Royal Parks control.

A Royal Parks spokesman confirmed that no permission had been sought for filming, adding: ‘A breach of Royal Parks regulations is a criminal offence.

‘Under the Royal Parks and Other Open Spaces Regulations 1997 it is an offence to take photographs of still or moving subjects in connection with a business or trade without written permission. Enforcement is a matter for the police.’

'Muertos Mondays' launches on Monday 1st December.
