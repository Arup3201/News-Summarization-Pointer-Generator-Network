They've been madly in love since they laid eyes on each other as children, but it hasn't always been a smooth ride for this couple.

Kirstie and Lyle Fisher were forced to keep their feelings secret for a number of years as they battled their biggest dilemma - the fact they happened to be first cousins.

The Perth couple, who  are busy raising their three children, are now unashamed of their romance after finally going public with their relationship seven years ago.

'We're happy, we aren't hurting anyone by being together and our kids are fine and healthy... We were meant to be together,' Ms Fisher told Daily Mail Australia. 

Lyle and Kirstie Fisher from Perth in Western Australia have been together for seven years and are raising three children together - they also happen to be first cousins

'People are allowed their opinions but we don't care what anyone else thinks.'

Kirstie, 29, says it took a long time to realise not everyone would be accepting of their partnership after they dealt with disapproving family members and friends who abandoned them.

'The worst comment I've had is that our kids will grow two heads and we should go to Tasmania,' she said.

'Even last week I had a confrontation with a woman at my children's school. She told me I should be shot and my kids taken away from us.

'If what everybody said bothered us, we wouldn't be together. The fact is without Lyle, I am not a complete person.

'I love Lyle and I won't stop loving him.'

Kirstie and Lyle, whose father's are brothers and grew up in different states, first met at a family wedding in Perth when she was nine years old. 

'I thought he was cute, I didn't care that he was my cousin,' she said.

'But then he had to go back to Melbourne with his family and we didn't really talk again until I was 15. He got my mobile number off my brother and we started texting and chatting over MSN.'

The couple tried to suppress their feelings when they were teenagers and eventually kept their feelings secret from their family for a number of years

Kirstie said she constantly pushed her feelings for Lyle aside because she knew they were related.

'Growing up you're always told they are your cousins, so you automatically assume if they're family then it is illegal to be together,' she said. 

When Kirstie turned 17, their aunty passed away and Lyle spent a week in Perth for the funeral.

'Up until my aunt's funeral there was the occasional time where I wished we weren't cousins. But we grew closer and by then I knew he wasn't just a cousin. 

'I had really strong feelings for him.'

Their first kiss was in Kirstie's bedroom while they were watching TV one night.

'I'm the only girl of three boys so they were very protective, but they didn't think anything of him being in my room because he was my cousin.

'From then on when we met up there were kisses and cuddles when no one was watching.'

They talked several times about becoming a couple, but Kirstie often got cold feet because she was worried what people would think.

Kirstie and Lyle went their separate ways for several years and she gave birth to her daughter Matilda (right) in a different relationship. They went public with their romance in 2008 and have two children together

Apart from Kirstie's father, who called the pair disgusting and hasn't spoken to them since, the couple say most people have been understanding

'Eventually we went our separate ways and both went through relationships. I even had my first daughter with another guy,' she said.

'That relationship ended and Lyle was just at that point where he wanted to be together.

'I took my daughter to visit him in Queensland - he'd moved there a few years before. That's when we just gave up trying to ignore everything.'

Lyle's mother sensed something was going on between the pair and confronted them with a stack of papers showing it wasn't illegal for them to be together and research on whether their children would be affected. 

'He bought me a ring that day and we got engaged,' Kirstie said.

They then had to bravely tell their immediate and extended families and admit it was a long process before people accepted it.

Apart from Kirstie's father, who called the pair disgusting and hasn't spoken to them since, the couple say most people have been understanding. 

'After a while my mum understood that I was happy and so she is happy for me. My two brothers are okay with it and so is Lyle's sister,' she said.

'We lost a few friends over it though. Lyle's best friend from primary school no longer talks to him and I stopped speaking to my best friend about a year ago.'

Kirstie and Lyle have two children together - Alex, 5, and Zachary, 2. Their daughter Danica died from complications during birth three years ago.

'My oldest daughter, Miranda, is 10 and she goes around telling everyone - she doesn't care. We don't hide anything from our kids.

'All the kids are perfectly fine and healthy. We love them to death.'
