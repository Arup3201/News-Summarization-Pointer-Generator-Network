Australian Greens Senator, Dr Richard Di Natale, reportedly wants to be chauffeured around Africa during a planned West African field trip 'to monitor the international response to the Ebola crisis'.

The Daily Telegraph has reported that the Senator wanted Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to order the Australian High Commission in Ghana to chauffeur him around Africa.

But his bold fact-finding mission could already be over, with the Federal Government making it clear that they would not provide consular assistance because what he has proposed is considered 'too dangerous'.

'Prior to being elected I was a public health specialist with experience in outbreak investigations so I am keen to visit West Africa,' Dr Natale stated. Dr Di Natale insisted he would pay his own way.

'My trip to West Africa will be privately funded but a worthwhile field trip would be impossible without assistance from the Australian government,' he said.

His request to the Federal Government included consular assistance in getting to and holding talks with health officials working in the region.

'Meetings with representatives from the World Health Organisation, the United Nations coordinating team and NGOs would simply not be possible without consular assistance,' the Senator added.

'I welcome the government’s change of heart on the deployment of Australian personnel to West Africa but concerns remain about the nature and scale of our involvement.'

The Senator did not hold back when he said 'delaying action until now has cost lives needlessly so I call on the government to provide me with the necessary embassy support for a field visit to help ensure we get this right'.

He'd previously also questioned the Federal Government’s Chief Health Officer about what training has been provided to Australian health personnel who could be deployed to combat Ebola.

'Health workers who are currently in West Africa to fight the Ebola epidemic have received intensive training in Europe before deployment,' he said at the time.

Dr Di Natale joined a chorus of criticism which had earlier accused the Australian government of doing nothing.

'When it comes to containing infectious diseases, urgency and preparedness is key yet it appears as though Australia has been sitting on its hands.' 

Australian officials relented in the past week, announcing they will fund an Ebola
treatment clinic in Sierra Leone, in response to pressure from the United States
and others to do more to tackle the deadly outbreak at its West
African source.

However, Australia also became one of the first countries to issue a
blanket ban on visas from the three most Ebola-affected
countries being Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia - sparking
widespread criticism.

The new commitment will see $20 million spent to staff
a 100-bed treatment centre.
