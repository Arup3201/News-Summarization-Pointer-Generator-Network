Wouldn't you? This Tweet by Lib Dem activist Shaun Boughton upset Tories in Colchester, Essex

A Liberal Democrat activist sparked a row after he made an apparent gun gesture at a waxwork of David Cameron and wrote: 'Wouldn't you?'.

Shaun Boughton, 38, was at London's Madame Tussauds when he posted the photo on Twitter, where he had attacked Tories calling for fewer seats on Colchester Borough Council, Essex.

The council's opposition leader hit back, calling the Tweet by Mr Boughton - who stood for a council seat last year and lost - 'deeply disturbing' and 'highly inappropriate'.

The Tweet, which was posted on Sunday morning, was deleted two days later after local newspaper the Colchester Gazette contacted the councillor.

It was posted in a reply to Lib Dem councillor Jon Manning, who had laid into Tory support for plans to cut the number of seats from 60 to 51.

Mr Boughton also wrote that the party was 'a bunch of out of touch chinless old Etonians toffs [sic]'.

Will Quince, Conservative group leader on the authority, described the Tweet as deeply disturbing and called on the Lib Dems to block Mr Boughton from representing them in the future.

He told the local newspaper: 'This is highly inappropriate and not the conduct expected of someone standing for election.

'I hope the Liberal Democrats will not allow him to stand as a candidate and distance themselves from this deeply disturbing and distasteful behaviour.'

After some constituents said he was being oversensitive, he told MailOnline he was standing by his comments.

He added: 'A joke in politics is fine but I think this was a step too far.'

Mr Boughton denied he was pretending to point a gun at the Mr Cameron waxwork, but said he could not explain what he was doing.

He said: 'If that’s the way they want to portray it, then let them get on with it.

'If they find it offensive I will respond and I will take anything off. That’s not a problem.'

He later Tweeted an apology, saying: 'For any offence that was taken in a recent picture I posted in regard to #conservatives I apologise stupid of me.'

Nick Barlow, leader of Colchester Council’s Lib Dem group, said he had been unaware of the Tweet and the Conservative reaction to it.

He said: 'It’s up to the local party to decide whether he’s right to be a candidate for the local elections.'

The council is run by a coalition of Liberal Democrats and Labour.

Mr Boughton's day out also saw him riding the London Eye and tweeting to the TV presenters Ant and Dec.

Mr Boughton was not the first Essex politician to cause controversy on Twitter.

Danny Mayzes, a Tory member of nearby Tendring District Council, was suspended by the Conservative Party last October after Tweeting: 'Am watching Machete - now that’s how you deal with immigration issues.'

The film showed a US senator try to win backing for an electrified border fence and also includes attacks on immigrants by vigilante patrols. He later apologised and deleted his account.

And Colchester Labour cabinet member Tine Bourne faced censure after posting a picture of a Champagne bottle hours after Baroness Thatcher’s death last April.

She later apologised for being 'crass' following a string of complaints.

Colchester's Lib Dem MP Sir Bob Russell has avoided setting up a Twitter account.

When a spoof one was set up in his name, he used parliamentary privilege to accuse Tory campaigner Darius Laws of setting it up. Mr Laws denied having anything to do with the account.
