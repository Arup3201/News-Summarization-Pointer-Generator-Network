White boots are now by far the most common among top-flight footballers, with almost 48 per cent of players favouring that colour in the last round of Premier League action.

White boots were once an indication of a special player - or at least a player who thought he was special. For those less gifted, the old Henry Ford statement used to apply: 'You can have any colour you like, as long as it's black.'

But now, judging from the colours on display in top-flight games played between December 13 and 15, it seems it's over three times more likely for a player to wear white boots than black - just 15 per cent of players wore the traditional colour. Green - in its various shades - was also more popular than black on 16.4 per cent.

Manchester City's Samir Nasri also decided to wear white boots during his side's match against Leicester

The 220 players starting games had their footwear noted and the survey found 17 different varieties - in some cases there were two colours that had to be classed as the base.

Hull were the most 'old-school' team with six pairs of black boots, but even in these cases the toes were a different, brighter colour.

Stoke, Chelsea, Leicester and Everton steered clear of black boots altogether, while Manchester United, West Ham and West Brom sported the greatest range with six different colours worn by their starting XIs.

Diego Costa had his shooting boots on as he notched his 12th goal of the season in the 2-0 win over Hull - and what boots they were. The Spain striker's footwear was an assault on the eyes of pink and blue, with pink just about 'shading' it.Â
