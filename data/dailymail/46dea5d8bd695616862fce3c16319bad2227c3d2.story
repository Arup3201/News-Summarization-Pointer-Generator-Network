A grandmother with cancer hammered a pair of scissors into her own head to stop being a financial burden on her family... only to survive and land them with a £30,000 surgery bill.

The woman, who has not been named, from Shenyang in China, was diagnosed with lung cancer a year and a half year ago.

But troubled by the financial strain her mounting medical bills were putting on her daughters, she took the decision to take her life into her own hands.

Pain: The woman, who was diagnosed with lung cancer a year and a half ago, waited until she was left alone and drove the scissors into the top of her head

So, one afternoon, she waited until she was left alone, took a large pair of scissors and drove them into the top of her head.

She plunged them with such force that they embedded themselves up to an inch into her skull.

Doctors rushed to her aid and took her immediately into surgery to remove the scissors.

Expensive: She plunged them with such force that they embedded themselves up to an inch into her skull. but the surgery to remove them cost 300,000 yuan

After some hours in the operating theatre, the woman emerged with the household tools no longer stuck in her head.

However, she was then told that the cost of removing the scissors was more than 300,000 yuan (£28,000) - a bill her family would have to foot.
