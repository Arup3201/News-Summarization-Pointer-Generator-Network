Former Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns has apologised for blowing more than twice the legal limit in his black Jaguar after he was fined and had his licence disqualified for drink driving.

Johns appeared in Newcastle Local Court on Thursday after he pleaded guilty to the offence in November last year.

He was fined $880 and disqualified from driving until June 4 by the magistrate, the Newcastle Herald reported.

Singer Daniel Johns was fined $880 and had his licence disqualified after he was sentenced at Newcastle Local Court 

Outside court, Johns told reporters the incident would 'never happen again' and he had completed a traffic offenders program.

'I made a mistake, for which I am really sorry,' the Australian singer said in his usual quiet tones.

While handing down his sentence, the magistrate told Johns he would have known he was over the limit when he got behind the wheel on October 28 unless he was a 'hardened drinker'.

The court heard the musician had bloodshot eyes and smelled of alcohol when police pulled him over on Morgan Street in Merewether while he driving between 70km/h and 80km/h. The speed limit for the area was 50km/h.

Johns, 35, blew 2.5 times over the legal limit and told police he had consumed four large glasses of wine over a three and a half hour period

Speaking outside the court room Johns apologised for the incident and said he regrets driving under the influence

He informed officers he had drunk four large glasses of wine over a three and a half hour period before getting behind the wheel.

His licence was suspended and he was taken into custody by police at the scene after blowing a reading of 0.126, according to NBN News.

'In the opinion of police the accused was moderately affected by intoxicating liquor when he was stopped by police,' court documents said as reported by The Daily Telegraph.

'His eyes were watery, bloodshot and he smelt heavily of intoxicating liquor.'

Speaking to NBN outside of the local courtroom after his earlier appearance in November, Johns said he regretted driving under the influence.

'I just made a mistake that I regret and luckily no one got hurt,' he said.

'I definitely won't do it again.'  

The musician, who is now dating fashionista Estelita Huijer (pictured right), said the incident would 'never happen again'

Johns was married to fellow Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia for two years, but according to his ex-wife they no longer have contact

Johns' former wife, Australian singer Natalie Imbruglia, revealed last year she no longer speaks to the musician.

'We no longer speak but I have no regrets and it was a very happy time of my life', she told The Joyce earlier this month.

'I've learned that it's ok to make mistakes as long as you learn from them. The break-down of my marriage showed me that you cannot control the outcome of things.'

The couple divorced in 2008 after two years of marriage. Following that, Johns dated model Louise Van der Vorst for just over four years.

The singer, who is rarely photographed in public, has now been dating fashionista Estelita Huijer for over a year, with the two first being spotted together last May.

Though Silverchair have not released an album since 2007, an image of Johns working on new music was posted on Huijer's Instagram earlier this year.

He also collaborated on a song titled Impossible with rapper 360 in January.

Johns burst onto the music scene at the tender age of 12 when he formed the rock band Innocent Criminals with his two pals, Ben Gillies and Chris Joannou.

The group got their big break in 1994 when they won an Australian demo competition, and after signing with record label Murmur they changed their name to Silverchair.

During their successful time together, the band produced five studio albums, including Frogstomp (1995), Freak Show (1997), Neon Ballroom (1999), Diorama (2002) and Young Modern (2007).

They also won a whopping 21 ARIA awards.

In 2011, the band announced their indefinite hiatus on their website in the form of a statement.

'We formed Silverchair nearly 20 years ago when we were just 12 years old,' it read.

'Today we stand by the same rules now as we did back then ... if the band stops being fun and if it's no longer fulfilling creatively, then we need to stop.

'Despite our best efforts over the last year or so, it's become increasingly clear that the spark simply isn't there between the three of us at the moment.

'Therefore after much soul searching we wanted to let you know that we're putting Silverchair into "indefinite hibernation" and we've decided to each do our own thing for the foreseeable future.'
