An entertainment company is suing the estate of Hollywood actress Marylin Monroe over the right to use the dead actress' three dimensional image. 

Delaware based company Virtual Marilyn LLC claim that they are the federal copyright owner of an 'audiovisual work and character artwork depicting a computer generated virtual actress adopting the persona of Marilyn Monroe'. 

However, the late actress' estate complains that Virtual Marilyn is 'likely to confuse consumers' and constitutes 'unfair competition'. 

Marilyn Monroe's estate is being sued by a company over the right to use the actresses 3D persona 

The company claims that when Marilyn Monroe died in 1962, her persona rights 'expired' along with her

According to legal papers lodged at the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, the virtual company claims that Marilyn Monroe's 'persona rights' died along with the actress in 1962 and were never owned by her estate. 

The 13-page court document describes the case as 'conflicting claims to ownership and use of different types of intellectual property rights involving the persona of the deceased human being Marilyn Monroe'. 

It describes her persona as 'Marilyn Monroe's name, image, likeness, signature and voice'. 

The case could have massive implications for the estates of other dead celebrities who have failed to register their image rights before the deaths.  

In 2012 the United States Court of Appeals at the Ninth Circuit ruled that Marilyn Monroe's 'persona rights expired in 1962 when she died'. 

That same year the United States Copyright Office awarded federal copyright registrations to the company for a 'computer generated virtual actress adopting the persona of Marilyn Monroe' and of 'original computer generated characters adopting the personas of celebrated people'. 

According to court documents, the Hollywood star is described as 'the deceased human being Marilyn Monroe'

The virtual company claims that while she was alive Marilyn Monroe 'never registered any aspect of her persona as a trademark'. 

The legal papers claim that she never agreed that her persona should be used 'in an exclusive manner that would provide an exclusive monetary profit for her probate estate or heirs'. 

As part of their claim the company is using several quotes from the actress to support their action. 

According to the legal documents, Marilyn Monroe said: 'I knew I belonged to the public and to the world, not because I was talented or even beautiful, but because I had never belonged to anything or anyone else... I am not interested in money. I just want to be wonderful.' 

The court complaint claims that the actress was so widely photographed by so many different photographers that it would be impossible to claim an exclusive trademark on her image.  

The company said they wanted the matter to go ahead to a trial by jury.
