School pupils have been forced to repeat an entire year - after a teacher left and took all their work.

The sixth form students had to redo coursework after the unnamed member of staff stopped teaching at City Academy in Bristol - and now can’t be found.

Officials say the science tutor left the academy last summer but failed to leave student’s coursework behind - meaning they had to retake the whole year. 

Bristol City Academy said it had been unable to contact the missing teacher, who left with all their sixth form students' coursework

The BTEC Level 3 Applied Science two-year qualification was based on coursework, rather than exams.

It meant that 11 sixth form students had to redo the vast majority of work.

Learning that the coursework had gone missing in September, several students had to retake one year.

The school says at least one student also had to do two years’ worth of work - in just one year.

It made several attempts to track down the lost coursework and the teacher to no avail - but assured students they could get back on track.

But it has now emerged that at least four students had fallen short of what they hoped to achieve.

It left their planned future in doubt after they tried to cram all of the work into the 13/14 academic year.

One BTEC student said she was 'angry and upset' by the outcome.

Another, a former Bristol Brunel Academy student, said she had regretted enrolling at the academy.

She said: 'I wouldn’t recommend going to this sixth form. I’ve gained nothing here in two years and it’s been wasted time for me.

'We trusted the school but it has failed us. None of us have had an apology.'

Missing: Sixth form students at Bristol City Academy were forced to repeat the year after a teacher left and took all their coursework

City Academy’s principal Gill Kelly said: 'In September 2013 it became apparent that a member of staff who left the academy that summer had not left behind the coursework she had been marking.

'Despite the academy’s best efforts to contact the teacher and locate the coursework, this was to no avail.

'The students concerned were given assurances they could complete the qualification in the space of a year.

'Teaching and classes were adjusted to do so, twilight sessions laid on after school and deadlines were extended significantly.

'The school regrets that some students were unable to engage with this added level of support and were therefore only able to achieve the equivalent of one qualification, rather than two, although this is not true of all the students in the original group.

'Out of 11 students, four were removed from the course due to either poor attendance or wider issues and three students went on to achieve the grades they hoped for.'
