A Sydney family will breathe a huge sigh of relief after Australia's central bank agreed to replace their burnt wads of cash worth $15,000.

A father of two had hid bundles of $20, $50, $100 notes in the oven of his home - unbeknownst to his wife - when he sold his beloved sports car in July 2012.Â 

Although the man thought the money was safe in the cooker as his wife never used it, she decided to heat up some chicken for their daughters and inadvertently baked the cash which turned into melted plastic.

Australia's central bank has agreed to replace a Sydney family's $15,000 after they accidentally burnt wads of cash in July 2012

At the time of the incident, the man told Ninemsn that he was relying on the funds from his sold Toyota Supra to pay off his mortgage.

'It was everything I had ... I've got nothing to my name,' he said.

His wife said she 'couldn't stop crying'.

'I struggled to breathe, I said "I burnt the money, I burnt the money". I felt like I was going to faint,' she said.

It is understood The Reserve Bank of Australia will restore the burnt bills as it met the requirements of its policy on damaged and incomplete banknotes.

The RBA's guidelines outlines that: 'If several pieces of the same banknote are presented, the RBA's policy is for each piece to be worth a share of the value in proportion to its size.'

'The combined value paid should be the face value of the original banknote.'

If less than 20 percent of the banknote is missing the full face value is paid.

However if between 20-80 percent of the note is missing value is paid in proportion with the percentage remaining.

No payment is made if more than 80 percent of the note is missing.

This comes after the man, western Sydney's Merrylands, made failed attempts to deposit the money at his local Westpac branch as the teller refused to accept it.

He said he was insulted that she wouldn't help him send the cash to the RBA.

Consequently a spokesman for Westpac issued an apology to the man, who declined to be named, and said they would do their best to assist him.
