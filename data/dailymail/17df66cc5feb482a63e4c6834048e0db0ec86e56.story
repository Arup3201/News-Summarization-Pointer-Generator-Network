A skull that was thought to have belonged to a Civil War soldier killed at Gettysburg is actually more than 700 years old and from the Southwest, say experts.

The National Park Service has revealed that forensic anthropologists determined that the skull is from the late 1200s and belonged to a Native American man in his early-to-mid 20s.

That's nearly 300 years before Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World and 400 years before the first settlement of English in the United States.

The company that nearly auctioned the skull last year said notarized documents had showed it was discovered on a Gettysburg farm, not the Southwestern US, according to NBC 4.

The firm - Estate Auction Company - was set to auction off the skull in Hagerstown, Maryland in June but canceled after members of the public complained.

They then donated the skull to the Parks Service.

An investigation is currently underway to find out how the skull's origins were confused, according to a spokesperson for Gettysburg National Military Park.

Meanwhile, the Parks Service said it is still deciding what to do with the Native American's remains.
