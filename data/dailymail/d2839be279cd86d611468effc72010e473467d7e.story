Ad men and social media gurus have been scratching their heads trying to work out why some videos and advertising campaigns go viral on Twitter.

But now the social network has confirmed what many might have feared - that there is 'no single magic formula' for widespread success.

Twitter examined three big viral video hits - actor Ryan Gosling 'refusing' to eat cereal, astronaut Chris Hadfield singing Space Oddity and Dove's Real Beauty marketing campaign.

Commander Chris Hadfield sang David Bowie's Space Oddity' aboard the International Space Station and his rendition spread around the globe. According to Twitter, more than 90 percent of shares took place in the first three days after Mr Hadfield posted it, demonstrating that it is possible to have a real word-of-mouth hit

Twitter UK's Gordon Macmillan wrote in a blogpost: 'One of the key things we learned from looking closely at these three is that videos don’t go viral in the same way.

'There are no rules to “virality” — while some ignite, and spread like wildfire across the web, the growth of others is much more measured, like ripples spreading across a lake.'

Twitter produced 'dynamic visualisation' videos to show how the videos went viral, using different coloured dots to show how they spread on the social network.

He said: 'The blue nodes represent Tweets; the bigger they are, the larger the potential reach of that Tweet. 

'The yellow dots represent retweets. In each case, reach takes into account not just followers, but also audience size and amplification by retweet.'

According to Twitter, more than 90 per cent of shares took place in the 
first three days after Mr Hadfield posted it, demonstrating that it is possible to have a real viral hit by word-of-mouth.

The link mentions peaked fast and were driven by 'global influencers' but the videowas first shared by Mr Hadfield himself, demonstrating the sustained growth was driven by one man's efforts.

It is thought the song proved so appealing because of its unique origin and was therefore far more popular than videos filmed on Earth.

The creators of the 'Ryan Gosling won't eat his cereal' video was seeded with only a small handful of top vine influencers to go global.

It was made using video clip tool Vine, collecting a series of six second clips of the actor being offered - and refusing - cereal in a dramatic way.

The videos were then seeded with key influencers within the Vine community to ensure the videos went viral and spread in a similar manner to a breaking news story.

However, of more interest to marketing agencies looking to create the next big viral hit, Dove's Real beauty campaign spread quite differently among clusters of local communities to enjoy a longer shelf life.

Mr Macmillan said it was driven by 'a long tail of link-sharing and by positive audience sentiment'.

Interestingly the Twitter video shows there were less spikes caused by influencers mentioning the campaign, which instead spread in clusters of communities, demonstrating the value of local engagement.

Mr Macmillan's blog post seems designed to promote Twitter's benefits to brands at a time when the social network is under fire for allowing trolling and threats to female users, among others.

Some users are boycotting Twitter in protest, while Twitter has promised to simplify its abuse reporting process, make its rules more straightforward and promote responsible use of the network.

Twitter is keen to show the community of over 200 million people is still a place where brands should be interested in spreading their messages and has recommended that companies hoping to have a big viral hit should use hashtags, use Vine and pay for promoted tweets and trend adverts.
