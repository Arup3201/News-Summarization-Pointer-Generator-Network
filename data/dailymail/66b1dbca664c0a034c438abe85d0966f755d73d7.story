Convicted: Danny Fitzsimons, 31, was sentenced to at least 20 years  for the killings. It was claimed he was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder

A former British paratrooper who was imprisoned in Iraq after shooting dead two bodyguards during a gun rampage in Baghdad has gone on hunger strike and wants to be brought back to the UK.

Daniel Fitzsimons, 35, gunned down ex-Royal Marine Paul McGuigan and Australian Darren Hoare, both 37, after going berserk while they were stationed in the capital working for security firm ArmorGroup, a subsidiary of G4S.

He later claimed he was suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder following a number of army tours which left him with repeated flashbacks, nightmares and anxiety attacks.

In 2011 Fitzsimons, from Rochdale, Greater Manchester, who was hired by G4s despite a robbery conviction, narrowly escaped the death penalty and was jailed for 20 years in Iraq for double murder and wounding an Iraqi security guard.

But at an inquest into the death of Scotsman McGuigan, of Peebles, Tweeddale, it was revealed Fitzsimons is now refusing to eat and wants to be transferred to a British jail to serve his sentence.

He also also wants to give evidence at the inquest and his family asked for the case to be adjourned to take instructions from the double killer. The request was refused.

Lawyer Paul Clark, on behalf of Fitzsimons's step-mother Liz said: 'The hunger strike wasn't realised over the potential transfer to a different position but was taken over prison conditions and the lack of access to a telephone.

'He had his first access to a telephone and the telephone call yesterday was made. I am informed that considerable progress has been made.

'This morning Mrs Fitzsimons received a telephone call due to ongoing correspondence between her and the Foreign Commonwealth Office in relation to his transfer.'

McGuigan had been a Green Beret before taking up work as a bodyguard, during which he spent two years providing security to the late former Beatle George Harrison. The killings occurred on August 9 2009, just 36 hours after Fitzsimons arrived in Iraq to start work.

The former soldier had been due to appear in court in Bolton accused of assaulting an Asian man on a train and also a firearms offence where he used a flare gun to scare off teenagers causing trouble outside his flat.

It emerged Fitzsimons had forged documents during the recruitment process to gain a position and G4S had failed to properly check his criminal record - an issue integral to the inquest.

The families of both McGuigan and Fitzsimons will ask questions of G4S at the inquest to find why more stringent background checks weren't carried out to deem his suitability for armed work in Iraq.

McGuigan's fiancée Nicola Prestage, from Droyslden, Greater Manchester, was pregnant when he was killed and she gave birth to their daughter prematurely one week after she had to identify his body once it was repatriated.

Miss Prestage, who met Paul in April 2007, told the Stockport hearing the couple were inseparable when he was in Britain from Iraq for three weeks at a time.

She said: 'We were due to get married in the February in Vegas. I spoke to him every day he was in Iraq. He would ring me after convoy and we then spoke on and off during the day and again at teatime we would go on Skype.

'Iraq is two hours ahead so on Saturday August 8 we went on Skype at about 6.30pm UK time. 

'We discussed baby names and chose a cot and my daughter spoke to him about a riding lesson she had been on. Everything was fine and normal.

'He did tell me he had gone to the villas and he had picked someone up but he was a dodgy character. He had been saying he was the black sheep of the family and his family had disowned him and he was never going to go back to the UK.

'He didn't name him but I found out later it was Danny Fitzsimons. He thought the guy was a bit weird. He didn't think he was staying on the camp, he thought he was moving on the next day.'

Miss Prestage said that while she was talking to her partner there was no indication he had been drinking and she didn't see him drink anything during the call which ended at 10.03pm UK time. He said he was going to bed and was dressed in his bed clothes. The following morning she received a telephone call to say Paul had been killed.

She added: 'G4S proceeded to tell me there had been an accident and Paul had been killed. They said that Paul, Darren and another guy were drinking all night and were extremely intoxicated, there had been a brawl and Paul and Darren had been murdered.

'To which I told her that he couldn't have been up all night because I was speaking to him until 12.03am. He was a very kind, thoughtful and loving person devoted to both of his children and my daughter. He would have been so proud of his daughter.'

A toxicology report revealed Paul was two-and-half times the legal drink drive limit at the time of his death, but the amount could have increased due to the period of time it took to repatriate his body from the Middle East.

August 2009

A G4S whistleblower sent a series of emails to the company in London, warning them about Fitzsimons’ previous convictions and unstable behaviour, before he was sent to Iraq.

A 2012 BBC Scotland documentary claims that a G4S whistleblower sent an e-mail warning G4S: 'I am alarmed that he will shortly be allowed to handle a weapon and be exposed to members of the public. I am speaking out because I feel that people should not be put at risk.'

August 9 2009

Just 36 hours after arriving in Baghdad, Fitzsimons gunned down ex-Royal Marine Paul McGuigan and Australian Darren Hoare, both 37, after going berserk.

It later emerged that he the former soldier had been due to appear in court in Bolton accused of assaulting an Asian man on a train and also a firearms offence where he used a flare gun to scare off teenagers causing trouble outside his flat.

September 2009

G4S admit that although there was evidence that Mr Fitzsimons falsified and apparently withheld material information during the recruitment process, his 'screening was not completed in line with the company's procedures'.

February 2011

Fitzsimons became the first Westerner to be convicted by an Iraqi court since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion when he was convicted in February last year, narrowly escaping the death penalty.

The former security contractor from Rochdale admitted shooting the men but claimed it was self-defence.

The men had been out drinking and the other two tried to kill him during an altercation, Fitzsimons said during previous testimony. He also claimed to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

September 2014

Inquest into Paul McGuigan's death starts. Fitzsimons goes on hunger strike and wants to be brought back to the UK to help with an inquiry into the tragedy.

McGuigan's mother mother Corinne Boyd-Russell said: 'We got a phonecall from Nicola at 7.30am on Sunday August 9. She was screaming down the phone, "Paul is dead, Paul is dead". 

'We said it can't be, he wasn't on duty, it was his week off. She phoned back and told me he had been killed in some sort of accident at work. At this point I sort of shut down and don't really remember what happened.

'I was basically told that they couldn't say any more but according to them [G4S], he had been in an accident, they had all had a drink and ended up in a fight and two men were shot and another man was injured.

'My life has been completely changed by Paul's death. It's had a knock-on effect on the whole family. Health-wise, relationship-wise, everything.'

The inquest continues.
