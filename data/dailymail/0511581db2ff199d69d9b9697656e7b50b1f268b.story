Luiz Felipe Scolari has been appointed as the new manager of Brazilian side Gremio following his departure from the national team after the World Cup debacle.

The 65-year-old is returning to the club for a third spell, after previous stints at the helm in 1987 and between 1993-96.

It is a quick return to management for Scolari, who was left his role with the national team earlier this month.

Return: Scolari in discussion with Gremio's chairman after he re-signs for a third spell at the club

The 2002 World Cup-winning boss returned to the national team in 2012, tasked with ensuring Brazil triumphed on home soil at this summer's tournament.

And it started so well as they finished top of Group A after wins over Croatia and Cameroon, and a draw with Mexico, before progressing to the semi-finals after victories against Chile and Colombia.

But it all came horridly undone in the semi-finals, suffering an historic 7-1 defeat at the hands of Germany. And their misery was compounded further after a 3-0 defeat to Holland in the third-placed play-off left them in fourth.
