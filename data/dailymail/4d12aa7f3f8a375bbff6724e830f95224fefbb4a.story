The world's only known jihadist rapper who uses out-of-tune hip-hop to drum up support for his holy war has been added to the FBI's Most Wanted List.

U.S.-born Omar Shafik Hammami is thought to be a senior leader with al-Shabaab, the Al-Qaeda affiliated group in Somalia which was placed on the U.S. State Department's terror blacklist in 2008.

Also known as Abu Mansour al-Amriki or 'the American', Hammami has been releasing rap songs in English on the internet since 2009 even though music is forbidden in Al-Qaeda's strict interpretation of Islam.

In two songs entitled Send Me A Cruise (Missile) and Make Jihad With Me, he taunts the West in a toneless drone and calls on other young Americans like him to join him on his mission.

In Make Jihad with Me, his singing style is described by ABCNews as a 'deep Barry White growl'.

Others have been even less complimentary, saying his a cappella tunes 'suck'.

In the songs, Hammami says he hopes to be killed by a drone strike or in a cruise missile attack so he can achieve martyrdom.

He invites young people to join the jihad to 'wipe Israel off the globe' and encourages strikes against the U.S. military in Afghanistan and Somalia.

The 28-year-old, who has been indicted in the United States on various terrorism charges, has been the subject of an international arrest warrant since 2007.

Hammami was born and raised to a 
Syrian father and American mother in a quiet suburb in Daphne, Alabama, 
but spiralled into radicalism before joining militant jihadists in 2007.

He
is among hundreds of foreign fighters in the ranks of the al-Shabaab, 
Somalia's most dangerous militant group, that is trying to topple the 
country's weak U.N.-backed government.

He was pulled into the terror network after marrying a Somalian-Canadian woman and later being 'brainwashed' on internet forums.

He moved to Egypt, where he met a fellow fundamentalist from America, Daniel Maldanado, who paved the road to Somalia for him.

However, his wife and the mother of his daughter refused to follow him and asked for a divorce.

Earlier
this year, he was rumoured to have been beheaded, but a month later he 
released his autobiography The Story of an American Jihaadi, which 
critics said contained odd spelling and banal observations.

Al-Shabaab carried out its first international attack in July 2010 in Uganda, killing 76 people watching the World Cup final in two bomb explosions.

The group has 'repeatedly threatened terrorist actions against America and American interests,' the Federal Bureau of Investigations said in a statement last week.

Also added to the terror most wanted list was Filipino Raddulan Sahiron, wanted for his alleged role in the kidnapping of an American in the Philippines in 1993 by the Al-Qaeda-linked Islamist group Abu Sayyaf.

Sahiron is believed to be the leader of the group, which was put on the US terror blacklist in 1997, the FBI said.

The Abu Sayyaf was set up in the 1990s with seed money from Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, according to the Philippine military, and has been blamed for that nation's worst terrorist attacks.

These include the bombing of a passenger ferry in Manila Bay that killed over 100 people in 2004, as well as many kidnappings of foreigners and Filipinos in the Muslim-populated south of the country where it is based.

The State Department's Rewards for Justice program is offering a reward of up to $1million for information leading to the arrest of Sahiron, who is believed to be in the Sulu archipelago.
