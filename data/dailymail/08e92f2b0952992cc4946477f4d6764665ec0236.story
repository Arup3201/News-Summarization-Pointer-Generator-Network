When new Southampton boss Ronald Koeman tweeted a picture of his deserted training ground back in July, it cuttingly captured the empty feeling of those in the dressing-room.

Among that disturbed bunch was Jose Fonte, one of the few Saints players not courted by a top-four club.

Five of his comrades – Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren, Calum Chambers and Luke Shaw – had been prised away from the south coast, as had manager Mauricio Pochettino, triggering talk of relegation battles and troubled times ahead.

Fonte – signed by Alan Pardew five years ago with the club in League One – is better placed than most to return assessment of the mood at that time.

‘I cannot be a hypocrite and lie – yes, I was worried, everyone was worried,’ he said.

‘It did not look good for us, but then when we appointed the manager it became easier.

‘I thought, “Well, we have lost players but we have got a very good manager”. Then we started signing players and my confidence grew, slowly at first then more came in.’

Today, not one of the five who quit St Mary’s in the summer reside higher than Fonte and Saints in the Premier League.

They are third, managerless Newcastle United the latest to fall victim to a playing style which marries craft, graft, silk and steel.

There is something utterly convincing about Koeman, too. He is measured but cheery with it, unflappable yet passionate.

During one first-half incident on Saturday, Magpies caretaker John Carver lurched over Dusan Tadic – floored on the touchline having just made the most of a Massadio Haidara challenge – and hurled invective at the Serb.

Koeman remained stood, hands in his jacket pocket, and smiled at Carver when he eventually cooled, raising his eyebrows and tilting his head in a knowing manner – ‘We’ve got this one in the bag’.

And he was right. Eljero Elia was the two-goal match-winner. The troubled Dutch winger – who played in the 2010 World Cup final – only arrived at the club earlier this month on loan from Werder Bremen.

He celebrated his first goal – a low smash under Holland goalkeeper Tim Krul – by making straight for compatriot Koeman, the man who could well rescue his career.

Yoan Gouffran fortuitously levelled for the hosts before Elia stole in to fire his second just after the hour mark.

The victory was Southampton’s third on the spin away from home in the league and took them onto 42 points – 'We are staying up' the tongue-in-cheek chant to emerge from the away end.

Elia was the hero, but Koeman signings Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Ryan Bertrand, Florin Gardos and Fraser Forster had also starred, not to mention the outstanding Harrison Reed, the 19-year-old midfielder promoted from the academy this season.

Saints stalwart Steven Davis admitted: ‘I didn't know much about Elia. He has given us a little spurt the last two games and if he carries on like that then great.

‘It was a similar story with the others who came in in the summer. As soon as you see them in training and the quality they possess it is a good place to be at the moment.

‘Then you’ve got the young lads coming through, that has been a big positive. We had big players missing in Victor (Wanyama) and Morgan (Schneiderlin) but Harrison showed what he can do.’

Koeman believes they can remain in the top four and qualify for next season’s Champions League. On recent evidence, you would not challenge his assertion.

Rather than feeling empty, the Saints are bursting with confidence right now.
