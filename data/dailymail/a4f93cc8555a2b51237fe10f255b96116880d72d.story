The mother of Stephen Lawrence yesterday thanked the pop stars who have agreed to perform at a special tribute concert to mark the 20th anniversary of her son’s murder.

Doreen Lawrence said Stephen’s love of music had encouraged her to organise a one-off concert featuring performances from artists including Plan B, Tinie Tempah, Jessie J and Emeli Sandé.

Proceeds from the event, which will take place at London’s O2 Arena on September 29, will go to the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.

Stephen’s mother, who has campaigned for justice since her son’s death in 1993, said she was delighted to have so many artists involved, and that it would be ‘very emotional’ to see them on stage.

‘Having so many young artists supporting the Trust in this way is getting the message across that we, as a society, need to make a difference,’ she said.

‘I want young people to feel inspired, be confident and have hope in their own future.

‘We work every day to empower youth and we’re so proud that the music industry is joining us in reaching out to change the lives of young people.’

Unity: a concert for Stephen Lawrence, is part of the SL20 campaign to mark the anniversary of Stephen’s murder.

It aims to highlight the legacy of the 18-year-old aspiring architect and the work undertaken by the charity in his name.

‘I would like Stephen to be remembered as a young man who had a future,’ added Mrs Lawrence.

‘Had he been given the chance to survive maybe he would have been the one to bridge the gap between black and white. He didn’t distinguish - he saw people as people.

'The main aim of the concert is to raise funds for the Trust. The other side of it is getting people to support it and let them know what it is doing, supporting young people.’

She added: ‘Emeli Sandé has been on 
board with us for a long time, and we were lucky to have all the major 
record labels getting together and wanting to help.’

Other artists involved in the one-off concert include Jamie Cullum and Ed Sheeran.

Speaking
at the line-up announcement at Abbey Road Studios in London, Scottish 
singer Sandé said she was honoured to be involved.

‘It’s
such an important charity and the work Doreen is doing is fantastic. It
shows that if you stand strong you can make a difference and make a 
change.

'I was quite young when it happened, but coming from a mixed-race family it was a big issue that we spoke about.’

Stephen,
an A-level student, was stabbed to death in a racist attack by up to 
six white youths on the evening of April 22, 1993, in Eltham, south-east
London.

Two men were found guilty of his murder and jailed for life in January last year.

The verdicts were a victory for the Daily Mail, which since 1997 has campaigned for justice for the Lawrence family.

Doreen Lawrence

Mrs Lawrence said: ‘It doesn’t seem 20 years for me. It took 19 years to get a conviction for just two of them.  

‘Most of my time is taken up with the ongoing struggle to get to the bottom of what happened to Stephen and make sure justice is done.

‘It hasn’t allowed me the time to go through a grieving process because my time is taken up with constantly challenging authorities to look into Stephen’s murder.

‘There have been a further 106 racist murders since Stephen was killed and there are still too many young people who do not have a sense of hope.’
