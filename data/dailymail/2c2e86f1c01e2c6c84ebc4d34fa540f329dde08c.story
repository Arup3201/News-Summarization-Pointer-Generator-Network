Diego Costa was very lucky to avoid being sent for an early shower during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool on Tuesday evening after his clear stamp on Emre Can.

But the provocative Chelsea striker didn't escape the punishment on social media as the Twittersphere reacted to his aggressive behaviour at Stamford Bridge. 

It wasn't only Can who felt the sharp end of Costa's studs, as the Spaniard continued his rampage with a second stamp on his defensive tormentor Martin Skrtel.

Costa as a stamp collector - simple gag but effective nonetheless

As Blues boss Jose Mourinho chose to sidestep any definitive answers surrounding the incidents, viewers of the ill-tempered contest put their creative heads together to produce some amusing results.

The obvious choices were all there to see, with various viewers using the 26-year-old's name similarity to coffee shop chain Costa Coffee as an opportunity to mock him up with loyalty stamp cards - one tweeter even claimed they would be able to get a free coffee thanks to all of Costa's stamps.

Others photoshopped him in a wrestling ring and also on the front of a first class stamp while he was also mocked up as a collector by Twitter user Wio. Hilarious stuff. Bookmaker Paddy Power was also tweeting about the Costa stamp. 

Having scored 17 goals already this season for the Blues, he's shown he has what it takes to let the football do the talking.

Yes, he has an aggressive side, which is handy in the Premier League, but let's hope he can start stamping his authority in a more positive manner after tonight's bad behaviour.
