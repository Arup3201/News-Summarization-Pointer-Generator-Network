Most people will have Halloween plans for their pumpkins.

But Dmitri Galitzine has other ideas. He has turned two giant pumpkins into sea-going craft as part of a world record quest.

One, weighing 800lb, has been covered in plywood, had the seeds scooped out and an engine fitted so the 27-year-old artist can attempt to cross from Gosport to the Isle of Wight tomorrow.

Never been in a boat: Dmitri Galitzine will attempt to cross the Solent in the giant pumpkin from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight

The other, weighing 600lb, has merely been hollowed out so Mr Galitzine can paddle it.

This is the craft in which he hopes to set a world record for the 100-metre dash today at Trafalgar Wharf in Portsmouth.

Yesterday,
when he launched the giant vegetables, Mr Galitzine – who has never 
sailed before, nor climbed aboard a pumpkin – was delighted they didn’t 
just sink.

Keep it steady: Mr Galitzine's hollowed-out pumpkin is lowered gently into the water ahead of the attempt

First crossing: Mr Galitzine wants to be the first person in history to cross the water in a hollowed out pumpkin

Journey: The pumpkin will be floated from Portsmouth to the Isle of Wight. Dmitri will also making an attempt at a record tomorrow when he tries to be the fastest to paddle 100 metres in a hollowed out pumpkin

After being 
shown which way round a paddle goes, he was upbeat about the chances of 
setting the 100-metre record, for which there are no known precedents.

The sprint must be completed in under three minutes but all he has to do for the Solent crossing tomorrow is get there.

He is chirpily confident he can cover the three-and-a-half-mile trip in ‘a few hours’ in his adapted vessel.

Daring: The giant pumpkin will be fitted with a small two-stroke petrol engine for the crossing, which will enable it to travel at two knots - or 2.3mph

Gently does it: Mr Galitzine tries his craft out in the water off Trafalgar Wharf, Portsmouth. Giant pumpkins are naturally buoyant and have a thick, waterproof exterior

Tow: Mr Galitzine said it was his first time in a boat

He
said: ‘The purist in me just wanted to stick an outboard motor on the 
pumpkin and go, but the experts told me I’d never make it over the first
big wave.

'I’m actually not a very good swimmer.’

The
artist, who is filming his voyages to present as an artwork, has at 
least resisted the temptation to carve a face on the pumpkins, or put a 
candle inside.

Another world record: Mr Galitzine is attempting to set a new record for the fastest 100 metre paddle in a hollowed out pumpkin
