A man in his 20s was stabbed at court today by a gang of masked youths in a suspected revenge attack.

The victim saw the gang jump out of a car as he was leaving Inner London Crown Court and tried to run back inside but got stuck in the revolving door.

They knifed him in the stomach in front of security and then fled, while police and the London Ambulance Service treated him on the floor of the security hall.

The man is thought to be the friend of a defendant who was in court in connection with a gang attack at a London hospital.

A man was stabbed outside Inner London Crown Court today and a gang was seen running from the area

The stabbing may have been a revenge attack after a rival gang member was targeted in a hospital

The gang, who were wearing scarves over their faces, were able to get to him before the metal  detectors and X-rays that everyone entering the court must pass through.

The victim is now in hospital with wounds to the stomach or ribs and police are still looking for his attackers, who are thought to be part of a Brixton street gang.

A court source said the victim's friend was a defendant and had seemed terrified after his court appearance.

The source said: 'He was extremely frightened and wanted to seek refuge in the court. He hung around right up until lunchtime even though his case finished half an hour before.

'He was afraid to go home. I suggest he never goes home because I don't think he will ever be safe with people like that out there.'

The source said the stabbed man was with the defendant when the attack happened.

'The victim was leaving court with a group of other men, some of who were defendants.

Shock: Police cars gathered outside after the man, thought to be a defendant's friend, was knifed

'As he went outside, a group of men with scarves covering their faces jumped out a car and ran towards the building.

'The man tried to get back inside but he got caught in the revolving door and that's when they stabbed him.

'I didn't see a knife but I saw one of them doing a stabbing motion, then they ran off.

'He collapsed as he came back into court and I could see they'd got him in the ribs. There was a trail of blood from the door to where he laid on the floor afterwards.'

The stabbing may have been a revenge attack after a rival gang member was targeted in a hospital in 2011.

Describing the original attack, the source said: 'They were literally going from ward to ward and pulling back curtains looking for somebody.

Violence: The youth collapsed just inside the court and was treated there before being taken to hospital

'The kid they were looking for had already been stabbed in the eye but I guess they hadn't finished him off properly so they broke into the hospital to get him - but when they couldn't find him they stabbed someone else.

'It's crazy. If they can stab someone in a hospital it's not a big deal for them to come to court and stab someone. It's kudos for them if they're not afraid to do that.'

Seven men are due to stand trial over the hospital attack later this year for charges of violent disorder, affray and having an offensive weapon.

Police are trying to identify the latest attackers from CCTV footage captured of the assault.

A witness, who did not want to be named, said: 'I was sitting inside and there were a group of lads at the top of the steps. They weren’t doing anything then all of a sudden four unknown guys rushed in from the car park.

'They came in and one guy got stabbed. They tried to rush through then stabbed him in the chest, like the lower abdomen, and ran out.'

Police cars littered the court car park while the man was treated for his injuries. Paramedics tried to stop the bleeding before he was carried out of court on a stretcher and taken to hospital.

Marked man: A source said the defendant linked with the victim had seemed scared to leave the court

Another witness said: 'There were about four or five of them and they looked young. They ran up the steps and started shouting.

'They had scarves over their faces. They ran out about 20 seconds later and went onto the street round the side of the court.

'It was only when I went over that I saw the lad on the ground and realised someone had been stabbed.'

A spokesman for the Met Police said: 'There has been a stabbing just outside the front entrance of the court. In terms of who this person is and how they relate to any court case we cannot say at this stage.

'They have been taken to hospital but their injuries are not thought to be life threatening.'

A spokesman for the ambulance service said: 'We were called at 12.45 to reports of a stabbing at Newington Causeway.

'We send a car, an ambulance crew and a duty officer and the air ambulance medical team in a car. We treated a man in his 20s at the scene who was then taken to hospital.'
