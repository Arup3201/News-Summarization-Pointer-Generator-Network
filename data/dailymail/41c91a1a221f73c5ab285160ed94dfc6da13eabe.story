These amazing pictures show 'The Wave', a natural beauty spot in the baking Arizona desert that was formed thousands of years ago by long-vanished waters.

Although it now stands miles from the nearest major water source, the extraordinary shapes were shaped by erosion due to rainwater in the Jurassic era.

It attracts hikers and photographers keen to see its colourful and undulating forms, but only 20 people are allowed to enter the desert each day to seek out the American landmark - with the trek taking two hours in the desert heat.

Exclusive: Only 20 people are allowed to enter the desert each day to seek out the American landmark

Ten people can win the opportunity to see the wave by entering online, but almost 15,000 sign up every day.

The other ten tickets can be won at a shop in Kanab, Utah, almost 50 miles from the wave.

And photographer from Mikhail Kolesnikov, from Rostov-on-Don in Russia, was one of those lucky enough to see The Wave.

The 27-year-old said: 'I entered the lottery to win one of the tickets you need to go and see The Wave.

'It was my dream to find it and I was really happy when after two hours of walking in the desert I eventually came across it.'

Gruelling: 'The Wave' takes two hours to walk to in the searing desert heat

The Wave is situated two hours away from the nearest road in the middle of the Arizona desert.

Mikhail added: 'It is really hard to find, GPS doesn't work over there, because the region stands on magnetic stones.

'Surprisingly, the wave is really small - it has three entrances like the letter Y, but when you enter it, it seems really big.'

The snapper had done his research on the rock formation and was delighted to eventually take the breathtaking picture.

He continued: 'It looks like this because of the water. Millions of years ago there was a lot of water and now there is only desert and wind.

Popular: Photographer Mike Kolesnikov was astounded by what he found when he got there

'This is the only place in the world where you can see rocks like this.'

After a momentous hike, the Russian was shocked that he was the only person there.

He said: 'After I found it I was all alone there for two hours as I don't think others managed to find it that day.

'I took four litres of water with me and drank it all - it was really hot that day.

'Rangers told us that last year some people didn't return from the desert - and it's really dangerous to stay in there at night.

'My legs were burning because I was carrying a very heavy backpack and it was hard to climb this small, but very steep mountain.'

Mikhail has only been a photographer for two years, and he couldn't have been happier with what he saw.

Otherworldly: Mike Kolesnikov enjoys the rock formations, one of a select number who ever will

He added: 'It is really rare to find and capture something like this.

'I like everything in the photographs, the light, shapes, shadows, composition, and of course they are the same as I dreamed.

'Sometimes you dream about visiting one place and when you find it you are unhappy because it is not as good.

'But this Wave was so much better than I ever dreamed.'
