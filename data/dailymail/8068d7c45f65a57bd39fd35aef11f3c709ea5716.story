England head coach Stuart Lancaster insists he will speak to  Dylan Hartley about the 'importance of on-field discipline' after the hooker's latest indiscretion.

Northampton Saints forward Hartley was handed a three-week suspension by the RFU after being sent off for elbowing Leicester Tigers' Matt Smith in a Premiership match in December.

Hartley escaped a lengthy ban after RFU judicial officer Jeremy Summers accepted his guilty plea and mitigating circumstances - including provocation by Smith - but he was still punished due to his previous poor disciplinary record.

April 2007 - banned for 26 weeks after being cited for eye-gouging Wasps forwards James Haskell and Jonny O'Connor.

March 2012 - received an eight-week suspension after being cited for biting Ireland forward Stephen Ferris' finger while playing for England in a Six Nations game.

December 2012 - banned for two weeks after being cited for punching Ulster hooker Rory Best during a Heineken Cup match.

May 2013 - sent off for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes during the Aviva Premiership final against Leicester at Twickenham. Received an 11-week suspension that sidelined him for the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia that he had been selected for.

December 2014 - sent off for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face. Banned for three weeks.

* Hartley,  has now been banned for a total of 50 weeks during his playing career.

And that means Hartley will be available for national selection during the 2015 Six Nations if Lancaster decides to choose him, with the tournament kicking off when England travel to Cardiff to face Wales at the Millennium Stadium on February 6.

But Lancaster insists he will speak to the 61-cap hooker before allowing him to take to the field in a Red Rose shirt this year.

Speaking at the unveiling of the 2015 World Cup sign on the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne, Lancaster said: 'I have not spoken to Dylan. I did not want to do anything until the disciplinary process was followed through, and obviously he has a ban to serve.

'He knows as much as anyone the importance of on-field discipline. He will have been disappointed in himself to put himself in that position.

'I will have a conversation with him.'

In total, Hartley has now received bans totalling 50 weeks.

Before his latest indiscretion, Hartley had already been given a 26-week suspension in April 2007 for eye-gouging, an eight-week ban in March 2012 for biting, a two-week punishment for punching in December 2012 and an 11-week expulsion for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes in the 2013 Aviva Premiership final. 

Hartley will miss three Aviva Premiership games before being available to return for Northampton’s European Cup clash with the Ospreys on January 18.
