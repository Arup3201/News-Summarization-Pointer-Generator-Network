Rory McIlroy has already secured the Race to Dubai crown but the world No 1 is still putting in the leg work ahead of teeing it up at the season-finale DP World Tour Championship.

McIlroy is about to bring the curtain down on his best ever campaign after winning The Open, the US PGA Championship, the BMW PGA Championship and the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.

There was also Ryder Cup triumph at Gleneagles in September as Paul McGinley's Europeans beat Tom Watson's troops from the United States.

McIlroy, who is paired with Henrik Stenson on Thursday at Jumeirah, has been warming up with some heavy work in the gym and posting pictures on Twitter.

He tweeted: 'Great leg workout to start the day.'

Meanwhile, McIlroy believes Lewis Hamilton deserves to win this year's Formula One world title after criticising the sport's controversial double-points system.

Whilst McIlroy competes in the final event of the European Tour, 60 miles away along the Gulf coast Hamilton goes head-to-head with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg for F1's glittering prize at the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi.

The fact McIlroy has already secured a second 'Race to Dubai' title without striking a ball in anger in this week's event has prompted debate the format of the Final Series requires tweaking to ensure a grandstand finale.

In order to guarantee an end-of-year showdown in F1 it is why double points were introduced this season, yet with 17 between Hamilton and Rosberg, ironically such a gimmick is not required on this occasion.

Whilst McIlroy is unconcerned whether golf's rulers change the Final Series format, he does at least feel F1 has taken a step too far.

'I don't think their whole season should be decided on one race with the double points,' said the 25-year-old.

'It makes it exciting for the fans, but I'm sure Lewis doesn't think it's that exciting right now.

'Hopefully for him it all works out and he does come out on top because he's definitely the deserving champion of this year.'

What double points in F1 has done is afford Rosberg a far greater opportunity to take the championship.

Victory for Rosberg, with Hamilton third or worse, will see him claim a crown won by father Keke in 1982.

If the current system had continued into the closing race, Hamilton could have finished at worst sixth behind a Rosberg win and still emerge as champion.

Given the furore behind the scheme since it was first aired almost a year ago, it is certain to be dropped when it comes up for debate at the next World Motor Sport Council meeting in early December.

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff, far from a fan with his drivers at the heart of the topic, said: 'My personal view is we have had a big backlash from the fans and many vocal personalities who don't like the system.

'Many within the group of stakeholders of Formula One also don't like the concept.

'I have been a racing driver myself. If I put myself in the situation I wouldn't want to have double points.

'Probably the decision taken together wasn't the right one, and we need to change it for the future.

'It is down to the commercial rights holder and the governing body, and I hope we are going to make the right decisions.'
