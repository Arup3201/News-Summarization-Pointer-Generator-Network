Chelsea Clinton has revealed that her mother Hillary beats her father Bill at Scrabble - but diplomatically added that the former President is a very good Boggle player.

And while Mr Clinton and his ex-Secretary of State wife are used to waging political war with words, it would seem they are equally likely to clash with consonants in their own home.

Chelsea, 33, opened up about family 
game nights in the Clinton household - claiming she and her parents all 
get 'deeply competitive'.

'Deeply competitive': Chelsea Clinton has told Piers Morgan that her mother Hillary beats her father Bill at Scrabble

'We generally are a card playing family', she said in an interview on CNN's Piers Morgan Live last night. 'We play Pinochle, Spades, Hearts, all the variants of Rummy'.

She revealed that family competitions usually yield results of 'pretty equal distribution' - with each of the Clintons winning about 33 per cent of the card games played.

However, it would appear each member of the former first family has their own strength.

'My mother is very good in Scrabble,' said the blonde beauty. 'In Boggle, my father is probably better... he's probably the best Boggler.'

Scrabble sees players score points by placing tiled letters on to a gameboard, while Boggle uses a plastic grid of lettered dice, in which players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters.

Chelsea added that she and her parents were 'equally good' at Upwords - where letters can be stacked on top of other letters already on the gameboard to create new words.

Piers then asked the Oxford University graduate - who married investment banker Marc Mezvinsky in 2010 - if she had a speciality.

'I do really well in the traditional board games: Backgammon, Checkers,' replied Chelsea.

The Clinton family met with other leading political figures at the Clinton Global Initiative's annual meeting in New York on Tuesday.Â 

The three-day conference that 'convenes global leaders to create and implement innovative solutions to the world's most pressing challenges' included speeches from Bono, Bill Gates and President Barack Obama.
