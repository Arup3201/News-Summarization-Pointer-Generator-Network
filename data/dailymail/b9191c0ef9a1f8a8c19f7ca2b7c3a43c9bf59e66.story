Nike's financial muscle is paying off in the World Cup battle of the boot brands as it leads Adidas by four goals following the group stage matches.

The world's largest sports company has seen its sponsored stars net 61 goals so far, while Adidas trail behind with 57.

But Adidas can take some consolation from the fact they can boast the most prolific boot, according to figures provided by Tomm Johnson.

Finish: Nike's Hypervenom boots - worn by Brazilian Neymar - have contributed 13 goals

Struggle: Umbro have only provided one assist, through Chile's Mauricio Pinilla (left) and no goals

The information and statistics were provided by Tomm Johnson.

Tomm worked out who scored and assisted using which manufacturer's boot during the group stage matches at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

His Twitter account is: @T0mmasaurus.

Their Adizero product - worn by stars including Lionel Messi, Robin van Persie, Arjen Robben, Karim Benzema and Thomas Muller - has contributed 38 goals in the tournament so far.

Nike's best-performing boot is the Superfly IV - worn by Chile's Alexis Sanchez and Switzerland's Xherdan Shaqiri - which has scored 21 goals so far.

And they also lead the assist charts, contributing 65 in the group stages, with Adidas grabbing just 54.

Again, however, Adidas' Adizero boot has been involved in the most assists with 28.

Umbro, meanwhile, has seen its players 
struggle to find the net during the tournament and only has one assist - Mauricio 
Pinilla's pass during Chile's 3-1 win over Australia - and no 
goals.

Puma-sponsored players have scored eight goals, while Mizuno and Warrior have each contributed three goals.

Under Armour also finished the group stage goalless.
