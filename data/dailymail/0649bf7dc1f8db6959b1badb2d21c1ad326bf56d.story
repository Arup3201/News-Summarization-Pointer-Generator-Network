Optimism has repeatedly proved unfounded in the past, so this year, this column is approaching the autumn Tests with a glass-half-empty outlook – when it comes to the hopes of the home nations.

Over the next month, the full might of the southern-hemisphere elite will be showcased in London, Cardiff, Dublin and Edinburgh. On nine occasions, they will face British and Irish challenges to their global supremacy and all the indications are that they will once again fly back across the equator with more wins than losses.

So many times in recent years, there has been a heartening sense of the perennial north v south gap narrowing, but it is hard to argue that case this time. The SANZAR countries continue to dominate their annual clashes with England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland.

Australia, seen as the weakest of the big three, will be galvanized with Michael Cheika now in charge 

The latest Rugby Championship once again delivered standards of intensity and skill which set the competing teams apart from their European rivals. South Africa’s epic victory over New Zealand was a vivid example of the apparently enduring gulf, while even stricken Australia so nearly raised themselves to sufficient heights to beat the world champions.

As is so often the scenario, the Wallabies arrive on these shores as the perceived weakest link, but with Michael Cheika now in charge they are likely to be galvanised. The All Blacks and Springboks, meanwhile, have exerted a hold over the home nations and even end-of-season weariness may not be enough to break that cycle.

Where will the northern wins occur? If the British and Irish finished with a win-count of five from their nine clashes with the big three touring teams, it would represent encouraging progress, but the omens are not good.

England's injury problems, especially in the front five, will be a problem against a powerful South African side

England have the strongest pedigree when it comes to claiming southern scalps, but they start the autumn with a multitude of injuries, especially in the front five – which is bound to be especially telling against the powerful Boks. By then, given the absence of so many leading lights, they may have succumbed to a fourth straight loss to New Zealand in the space of six months.

It is high time for an end to the damaging period of Welsh failure against the SANZAR countries, but that will appear as a distant fantasy if they suffer yet another near-miss against the Wallabies next Saturday. The Irish have key injuries and they no longer have Brian O’Driscoll, while a Scotland win over the All Blacks would represent one of the greatest upsets of this or any era.

The head-over-heart prediction is for England, Ireland and Wales to muster a total of four wins between them. At home, that is not enough. Let’s hope the glass is fuller than it looks.

Something had to give at Leicester and, sure enough, it has this week, with backs coach Paul Burke leaving the club following a grim 15-3 defeat at the Scarlets. The Tigers have endured a poor start to the season but Burke has been unfortunate to lose his job with the East Midlands side in the midst of a debilitating injury crisis. The Irishman has to operate with a continuously revolving and diminishing cast of fit backs – leading to endless reshuffles and a lack of cohesion. At least in the short term, Leicester will fill the void from within. Another Irishman, Geordan Murphy, will take on the role vacated by Burke, after assisting him since retiring as a player. If the man once dubbed the ‘George Best of rugby’ by Dean Richards can bring the same unorthodox flair to his coaching as he did to his own game as a free-spirit full-back, he will transform the Tigers’ attacking game. Yet, he faces a daunting equation – resources are diminished, but expectations are not.

After Samu Manoa had made his 100th appearance for Northampton last weekend, he was congratulated by club-mate Tom Wood on Twitter, as he prepared to return home to America to take on the All Blacks. The flanker no doubt spoke for the entire England squad when he said: ‘Good luck next weekend, soften them up for us.’ The USA will go toe-to-toe with the world champions in front of a sell-out crowd of 62,000 at Soldier Field, Chicago, tomorrow, a week before New Zealand face Stuart Lancaster’s men at Twickenham. Realistically, the Eagles can’t hope to beat the Kiwis, but they can throw a spanner in the works by targeting Sonny Bill Williams on his return to union, or shackling Dan Carter when he emerges from the bench for his Test comeback. This fixture is a potentially momentous occasion in the history of USA rugby, so the hosts can benefit from it hugely in the long-term, but in the short-term they could also help Europe’s leading nations by further slowing the All Black juggernaut.

Dan Lydiate is heading home to Wales after the November international window – a less-than-startling development which was confirmed by his Parisian club, Racing Metro. It is likely that he will re-surface in Swansea with the Ospreys, on a dual contract with the WRU. His return home makes sense, as the move across the Channel has been an ill-fated exercise. In his pomp, Lydiate is a Lion and a formidable Test player, but he has been under-valued by his French employers. Warren Gatland will welcome the blindside flanker back into the Welsh game with open arms, knowing that there is ample time to repair his confidence and restore his game to its peak before next year’s World Cup.

Last Word – It was somehow inevitable. Having ignited the rebellion against the European status quo which led to the creation of the new Champions Cup, Aviva Premiership clubs have suffered in the early stages of the new tournament. After two rounds of matches, the tally of victories for each of the competing leagues is as follows; Premiership five, French Top 14 seven and Guinness Pro12 eight. The results will be particularly satisfying in Ireland – whose provinces have claimed four wins in six games – and Scotland, for whom Glasgow have blazed a trail with back-to-back successes. In fact, the latter have generated much of the intrigue so far. Their 37-10, opening-weekend demolition of Bath was arguably the most eye-catching result to date, while Munster’s last-kick win at Sale delivered the most remarkable drama of the new event’s initial encounters. Pool-stage ‘derbies’ may fit in with the heightened meritocracy this year but, as expected, they and the occasionally absurd kick-off times are not a positive development.
