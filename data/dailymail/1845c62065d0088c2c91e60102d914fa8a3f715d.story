The European Union is set to impose further sanctions on Russia following its decision to annex Crimea as German Chancellor Angela Merkel today declared the G8 'is dead'.

EU leaders are set to meet in Brussels today to discuss how to deal with the developments in Crimea after Russian troops seized majority control of the peninsula.

In an address to the German Parliament 
in Berlin this morning, Merkel said the EU was readying further 
sanctions and that the G8 forum of leading economies has been suspended
 indefinitely.

Russia holds the presidency of the G8 and President Vladimir Putin was due to host his counterparts, including President Barack Obama, at a summit in Sochi in June.

But Merkel today declared the G8 will not meet again until the situation in Ukraine has been resolved.

'So long as there aren't the political circumstances, like now, for an important format like the G8, then there is no G8,' Merkel said. 'Neither the summit, nor the format.'

Earlier this week, the EU and the United States slapped sanctions on certain individuals that were involved in what they say was the unlawful referendum in Crimea over joining Russia.

Moscow formally annexed Crimea earlier this week in the wake of the poll. The Black Sea peninsula had been part of Russia for centuries until 1954 when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev transferred it to Ukraine.

Russian forces effectively took control of Crimea some two weeks ago in the wake of the ouster of Ukraine's pro-Russia president, Viktor Yanukovych, after months of protests and sporadic violence.

The crisis erupted late last year after Yanukovych backed out of an association deal with the EU in favor of a promised $15 billion bailout from Russia. That angered Ukrainians from pro-European central and western regions.Â

Merkel said EU leaders would increase those 'level 2' sanctions against Russia when they meet onThursday in Brussels to widen the list of those whose assets are being frozen and who are banned from traveling.

She also reiterated that if things worsen, the EU is prepared to move to 'level 3' measures, which would include economic sanctions.

'The European Council will make it clear today and tomorrow that with a further deterioration of the situation we are always prepared to take level 3 measures, and those will without a doubt include economic sanctions,' she said.

Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has close economic ties with Russia which is its main supplier of gas and some companies are worried they would be hit if economic sanctions go ahead.

The United States and its G7 allies will gather next week in The Hague without Russia to consider a further response to the Kremlin's moves in Crimea.

Merkel, who still wants a diplomatic solution to the crisis, also questioned whether annual German-Russian government consultations, scheduled to take place in Leipzig next month, could go ahead.

Last week, Merkel, who was brought up in Communist East Germany, warned Moscow that it risked 'massive' political and economic damage if it refused to change course.

The government on Wednesday publicly intervened in business dealings with Russia for the first time since the escalation of the crisis by telling defence contractor Rheinmetall to halt delivery of combat simulation gear to Russia.

European Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger spelled out some of the sectors further sanctions discussed by EU leaders in Brussels this week could cover.

'We have products that Russia needs - machines, equipment, hardware, software, vehicles,' Oettinger told German television, playing down the prospect of sanctions in the energy sector.
