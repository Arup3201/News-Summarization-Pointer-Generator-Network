The United States' top military general said Wednesday that half of the Iraqi army is incapable of putting their sectarian differences aside to fight off the Islamic State.

Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters travelling with him on a trip to Paris that 24 of the Iraqi army's 50 brigades were too heavily comprised of Shiites to effectively work together with other religious sects to combat  ISIS.

U.S. military assessors who spent the summer in Iraq found that the other 26 brigades could partner with the U.S., but they would need additional training and equipment, Dempsey said, according to the Associated Press.

Dempsey's admission to reporters today follows testimony he gave to a Senate committee on Tuesday indicating that he would consider advising the president to put boots on the ground in Iraq if the United States' strategy to form a broad international coalition against ISIS fails to ward off ISIS.

President Barack Obama has unequivocally ruled out ground troops in Iraq in numerous public statements, but Dempsey revealed to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the president told him privately 'to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.'

Dempsey told the senators that U.S. forces could engage in 'close combat advising' if the circumstances called for it.

While making it clear he was speaking hypothetically, Dempsey suggested that American troops could find themselves 'accompanying' Iraqi troops on a mission to retake the city of Mosul, for example.

The general's affirmation that the president may have to send U.S. troops on a combat mission  after all was panned as an about-face by the White House and the first step towards the 'mission creep' that dovish Democrats had been nervous about all along.

The White House rushed to reiterate that Dempsey was not foreshadowing military action and was merely explaining how he would advise the president in a hypothetical scenario.

But on Wednesday Dempsey again alluded to boots on the ground while speaking with reporters about the situation in Iraq.

Dempsey repeated the administration's claims that only Iraqis, working together, could save their country from the hands of ISIS and no amount of U.S. military might would be able to do that for them.

Iraq must form an inclusive government that represents the three major religious sects in the county if it wants to defeat the Islamic State, he said.

And then, according to Fox News, Dempsey added, 'I'm telling you, if that doesn't happen then it's time for Plan B.'

Progressive activist group CodePink, known for its anti-war protests, showed up at the hearing Dempsey was testifying at on Tuesday to show its opposition to boots on the ground in Iraq. Dempsey indicated on Tuesday that the U.S. could shift forces into combat roles in Iraq if the circumstances called for it

The general also theorized that the Iraqi government may be willing to revisit its decision not to give the U.S. military legal immunity in the country if the President Obama agrees to send troops to Iraq to train its army.

'There will likely be a discussion with the new Iraqi government, as there was with the last one, about whether we need to have' them approve a U.S. military presence in the country, Dempsey said.

The Iraqi government's refusal to sign a status of forces agreement granting the U.S. army immunity after the conclusion of the Iraq war led to a withdraw of American troops in 2011.

A vocal group of Republican lawmakers, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, the ranking member of the Senate's Armed Services committee, have claimed that if the U.S. had left a residual number of troops in the country at that time, Iraq would not be in the quagmire it is today.

Dempsey was in France today meeting with his foreign counterpart there as President Obama was in Tampa, Florida, to receive a briefing on the campaign to roll back ISIS.

Obama will meet with U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Lloyd Austin during his trip, as well as other CENTCOM commanders. CENTCOM oversees military operations in the Middle East, including Iraq and Syria.

According to the White House Obama will take time to speak with other service members working to implement his strategy in Iraq to thank them for their hard work.
