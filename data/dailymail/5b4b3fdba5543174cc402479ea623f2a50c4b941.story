A mother of a three-year-old boy, who remains in a critical condition in a Sydney hospital, screamed in horror as she watched her son chase his father across a busy road before being struck by an oncoming motorist in Sydney's west.

Onlookers rushed to the boy's aid following the accident at Blacktown on Wednesday - while the mother sobbed and screamed at the scene, bashing the bonnet of the driver's car in a struggle to come to terms with what had just happened.

A witness said the shocked mother's screams were so loud she thought she was hearing a domestic dispute.

'I heard a woman screaming and crying and hitting a car ... I thought it was a domestic dispute,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

The boy was flown to Westmead Children's Hospital and remains in a life-threatening condition having suffered severe internal and head injuries.

At about the same time yesterday a man, 59, hit another young boy in what was reported as a hit and run incident at Haberfield in Sydney's inner west.

He last night handed himself in to police following the incident which saw a two-year-old boy hospitalised with cuts and bruises.

The Croydon Park man attended Burwood Police station last night and was issued with an infringement notice for failing to exchange details.

Meanwhile, a CareFlight spokesman Ian Badham told The Sydney Morning Herald that the injuries sustained by the young boy in the Blacktown accident were serious.

'Critical injuries would be an understatement,' he said.

'Our doctors worked with paramedics on the scene have placed him in an induced coma,' he said.

Mr Badham also confirmed that his mother and father were with him when the accident happened.

Nine News report that witnesses told them the boy's father stepped out on to busy Reservoir Road, not realising his son was running behind him - and the young boy was then hit by a car.

An off-duty nurse who was driving by stopped to help the young child before paramedics arrived, the program also said.

A crime scene has been set up on Reservoir Road by Blacktown Local Area Command and the Crash Investigation Unit, and the road was closed in both directions while the initial investigation took place.

The driver of the sedan is assisting police and will undergo mandatory blood and urine tests.

Earlier on Wednesday a two-year-old child was hit by a car in Sydney's inner-west suburb of Haberfield, and was also taken to Westmead though escaped without major injuries.

On Tuesday a seven-year-old was critically injured near a school in Oakhurst.

These incidents take the toll to four children who have been hit by cars in NSW this week, after a young boy was struck outside St Helen's Park Primary School on Monday.
