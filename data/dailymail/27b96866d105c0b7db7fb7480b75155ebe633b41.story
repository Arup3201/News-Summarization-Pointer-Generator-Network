The captain who tipped a young Kevin Pietersen’s kitbag out of the dressing room window in frustration at his young charge’s behaviour has described his former team-mate as the ‘most gifted but difficult’ player he ever led.

Jason Gallian’s irritation with a 23-year-old Pietersen boiled over in 2003 when he was Nottinghamshire captain, and the young star threatened to leave his first English county in protest at his mentor Clive Rice being sacked as coach.

‘Playing with Kevin was a real privilege,’ Gallian said. ‘What he could do to bowlers to single-handedly win you the game was frightening.

Pietersen has fallen out with plenty of big names in cricket wherever he has played over the years

‘I saw him destroy Shane Warne at Hampshire to the extent he had to take himself off after three overs. You couldn’t help but think “this guy is special”.

‘But I never got as frustrated with anyone as I did with Kevin. For it to get to that situation [with the kit bag] wasn’t right. Probably from both sides. I can empathise with Alastair Cook.

‘He’s a very amenable bloke and if he has fallen out with Kevin it just demonstrates the world that Kevin wants to live in.’
