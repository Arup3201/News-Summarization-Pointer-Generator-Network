Wladimir Klitschko and Bryant Jennings came face-to-face at the top of the Empire State building on Wednesday ahead of their bout at Madison Square Garden on April 25.

The pair were pictured on the 86th floor of the historic building, as they took part in a photo call in preparation for their fight later this year.

Klitschko, long-reigning heavyweight champion, will be fighting in the United States for the first time since 2008, where he beat Sultan Ibragimov at the same venue.

However, 30-year-old Jennings will go into the fight with plenty of confidence after an unblemished record of 19 wins with 10 knock-outs in his career so far, with all of the American's bouts coming on home territory too.

Should the Ukrainian get the better of Jennings, a match-up against newly-crowned WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder would be on the cards.

The 29-year-old became the first American boxer to claim a world heavyweight belt since 2006 after his unanimous points win over Canada's Bermane Stiverne in Las Vegas on January 17.

A potential bout with Tyson Fury would also be a possibility for Klitschko too, according to the Manchester heavyweight's co-promoter Mick Hennessy.

In an interview with ESPN Jennings said: 'I believe the fight against Wladimir will happen this year.

'Tyson is in the WBO mandatory position for Wladimir, so after Klitschko's next fight we will be doing some serious negotiations, otherwise it will end up going to purse bids.

'Tyson wants it in a big way and Wladimir's team like the idea of the fight because it's the biggest one out there for them.Team Klitschko are open to coming to the UK if the economics are right.'
