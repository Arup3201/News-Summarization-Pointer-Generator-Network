A high-profile bank boss has been cleared of killing a van driver in a head-on crash after he fell asleep at the wheel and drifted into oncoming traffic.

Gordon Soutar, 50, an operations director at Virgin Money, was yesterday cleared of causing death by dangerous driving and the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving at Newcastle Crown Court.

Mr Soutar told jurors he had been suffering from undiagnosed sleep apnoea at the time of the collision and must have been having a ‘micro sleep’ while at the wheel - causing the crash.

The accident took place on the A1 Felton bypass on the single-carriageway section in Northumberland at 7.30am on November 12, 2012.

Eyewitnesses said that Mr Soutar’s white BMW 520 - which costs around £32,000 brand new and had its own personalised numberplate - drifted into oncoming traffic on a single carriageway stretch of the road, colliding with Nigel Sowerby 37, who was driving a VW caddy van.

Mr Sowerby from Cleckheaton in West Yorkshire was airlifted to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary by Great North Air Ambulance but died as a result of his injuries.

During the trial, Mr Soutar said he could not remember anything about the accident and  tests after the fatal crash revealed he had the sleeping condition.

The court also heard from Dr Tom Mackay, a sleep specialist and director of the sleep centre at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, who first saw Mr Soutar in January 2013.

He said that he had diagnosed the bank boss with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome in April 2013.

The sleep disorder involves the person involuntarily holding their breath for a number of seconds at a time while asleep before the brain realises and sparks the breathing process again.

It prevents the sufferer from being able to reach the crucial stages of deep sleep. The condition can lead to micro-sleeps, when the person undergoes short periods of inattention – from fragments of a second to about ten seconds – and it is this that Soutar claims was happening to him on the morning of his crash.

Jurors took 90 minutes to acquit the Virgin Money boss of any wrongdoing after a week-long trial at Newcastle Crown Court.

Mr Soutar expressed his regret over the accident and told the court he prays for his alleged victim’s family every day.

Turning
 to face Mr Sowerby’s family he said: ‘If I could address the family. It
 has been 16 months since that very tragic accident and there has not 
been a day that has passed when I have not thought about the family.

‘I pray for them every day. Whatever happens after this they will always be in my thoughts.’

Mr Soutar, a married father-of-three and grandfather started off as an office junior with Bank of Scotland then worked his way up the ranks to senior management level.

He said he had been head-hunted by RBS and also worked for Capita before joining Virgin Money in April 2012.

At the time of the accident he had 640 people working for him in Newcastle, Edinburgh and Norwich.

He was doing his usual Monday morning commute in his BMW from his home in Scotland to Virgin Money’s office Gosforth in November 2012.

Mr Soutar said his last memory of the journey was passing a supermarket in Berwick and the next thing he remembers is coming round in the car after the crash, himself seriously injured.

He told how since the accident he had been getting the train to work in Newcastle and now does limited driving and always with his wife beside him.

He said: ‘I always have my wife in the car now for comfort. It may be a confidence thing. It’s a big shock and a big scare to be involved in such a serious accident.’

The bank boss, of Cairneyhill, Dunfermline, was heading south while Mr Sowerby, from West Yorkshire, was in his works van with his colleague going north.

Mr
 Sowerby’s family laid him to rest at All Saints’ Church, Misterton on 
Tuesday 27th November at 12.00 noon in what was described as a 
‘celebration of his life.’

He
 left behind his mother Carol, father Phillip, sister Jo and brother in 
law Harvey. He was also a doting uncle to Alex & Dan and a grandson 
to Roy.

His
 family asked for donations to the Great North Air Ambulance Service, as
 they airlifted him to hospital in an attempt to save him after his 
accident. Donations amounted to £1000.
