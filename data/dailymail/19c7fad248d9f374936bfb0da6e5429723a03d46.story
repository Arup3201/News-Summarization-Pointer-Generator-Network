A direct telephone line between Cuba and the United States has been re-established for the first time in 15 years. 

U.S. calls to Cuba have typically been put through by companies in other countries like Italy and Spain.

But now an agreement has been signed  that allows Americans and Cubans to make direct phone calls.

Etecsa, Cuban's state telecommunications company, said the change would make calls easier and more affordable. 

President Barack Obama, pictured at the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference, declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba. A direct telephone line between the two countries has been re-established for the first time in 15 years

'It contributes to providing better infrastructure and better communications quality between the people and our two countries,' it said.  

The move marks a historic shift in U.S policy, which aims to bring an end to half a century of Cold War tensions.

The lines were originally cut after American phone companies refused to pay a 10 per cent tax on calls between the two countries.

But President Barack Obama declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba in December, announcing the re-establishment of diplomatic relations as well as economic and travel ties with the communist island. 

At the time he said: 'Isolation has not worked. It's time for a new approach.

'We will end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests.'  

Around two million Cuban-Americans are thought to live in the U.S. and many families rely on phone calls to stay in touch.

Bill Pereira, CEO of Etecsa, said: 'We hope that this is the beginning of something, of a relationship that will allow us to build and grow and facilitate and ease communication between family members and loved ones.'

Havana residents use public phones to make calls in December 2000. The Cuban government cut off direct telephone service from the United States to Cuba, although Cubans could still call the U.S.

Residents are hoping that the step forward will lead to other services becoming available. 

Less than a quarter of Cubans, whose average wage is $20 per month, currently have any type of internet service. 

Virtually all home connections remain illegal and getting online at government centres is very expensive, as they charge between $2.50 and $4.50 an hour.

Obama set connectivity as a priority in the United States' new relationship with Cuba, making telecommunications equipment, technology and services among its first priorities.
