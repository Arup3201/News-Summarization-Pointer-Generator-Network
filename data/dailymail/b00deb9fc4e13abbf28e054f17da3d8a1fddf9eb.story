Paul Clement, the English coach that helped Real Madrid win La Decima,  has admitted he wants to become a manager.

The right-hand man to Carlo Ancelotti plans to go into management once he is done with Real, who won the Champions League for their 10th European Cup last year.

Clement is in demand to take over his own team but the 42-year-old is happy enough winning major trophies at the Bernabeu for now.

Asked how long he wants to remain Ancelotti's No 2, he told the Independent: 'As long as I can. I'm enjoying it tremendously and it's the chance to win big trophies.

'That doesn't mean I haven't got my eye on what I want to do next, which is to try to be a head coach somewhere.'

Brendan Rodgers is among those who made the leap from coach to manager and Clement, a former Chelsea youth-team coach, can take inspiration from the man he knows  from his time at Stamford Bridge.

The pair got to meet again when Real beat Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield, and 1-0 at the Bernabeu. 

'When we played at Anfield we went into the boot room after the game, so when they played here and then trained here the following morning we all sat down together in my office - Carlo [Ancelotti], Brendan and former sporting director Frank Arnesen,' he says. 

'It was good to talk. When I joined Carlo, Brendan had just left to go out on his own, but we all have that Chelsea connection.'
