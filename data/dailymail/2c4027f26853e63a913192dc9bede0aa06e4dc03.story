Jan Vertonghen's winning goal 13 minutes from time against South Korea ensured Belgium's promising start to this World Cup continued, as Marc Wilmots' side recorded a third consecutive win.

Adnan Januzaj made his first competitive start for Belgium, while Everton’s Kevin Mirallas led the line in place of Romelu Lukaku. The Chelsea striker was dropped after a couple of abject performances against South Korea and Russia and played no part in proceedings in Recife.

United midfielder Marouane Fellaini and Spurs duo Jan Vertonghen and Moussa Dembele were  part of Wilmots’ starting eleven, as Thibaut Courtois continued in goal. Manchester City centre-back Vincent Kompany missed out through injury and Eden Hazard was only introduced late on.Sportsmail takes a closer look at how Belgium's Premier League contingent fared…

Young devil: Januzaj challenges Ki Sungyeung for the ball in Sao Paulo

2mins – Januzaj's first involvement in the game is to backheel the ball straight out of play for a South Korea throw.

3mins – There is a worrying moment for Belgium as Dembele goes down clutching his head after clashing with Kim Shinwook in the air. The Spurs midfielder receives treatment from the Belgium medical team and is okay to continue.

Challenge: Dembele was busy in the first half as South Korea threatened on a number of occasions

7mins – Lee Chungyong goes down wanting a South Korea penalty after an untidy challenge by Dembele, but the referee sees nothing in it and waves play on.

18mins – Belgium's first real shooting opportunity is wasted by Vertonghen, the Spurs defender blazing a free kick from 25 yards high and wide.

21mins – A really good piece of defending from... Januzaj, of all people. The Manchester United youngster tracks back and dispossesses Bayer Leverkusen forward Son Heungmin inside the Belgium box.

Wasteful: Vertonghen was guilty of some wayward shooting from set pieces in the opening half

Control: Mirallas drags the ball away from Ki Sung-yeung as Belgium try and work an opening

23mins – Some sharp play from Mirallas on the right creates a decent opportunity for Wilmots' men, but agonisingly for the Everton forward there are no Belgium players in the box to attack his inviting dinked cross to the back post.

25mins – Fellaini does well to win an aerial challenge and nod a throw in the direction of Mirallas on the penalty spot. He tries to shoot but his effort is blocked. The ricochet falls to Mertens in space but the Napoli speedster sidefoots a shot high over the bar.

Wayward: Mertens skies a brilliant chance to put Belgium ahead midway through the first half

30mins – Dembele loses the ball in midfield and Courtois has to get down very quickly to tip Swansea City midfielder Ki Sung-yueng’s daisy-cutter from distance round the left-hand post.

37mins – A dangerous run by Januzaj comes to an abrupt end as he is blocked on his way into the area. Vertonghen wins the six-man discussion about who will take the set piece, but it's another poor effort as his shot cannons into the wall.

Early bath: Defour trudges past Belgium boss Marc Wilmots after being shown a straight red card

45mins – RED CARD: Steven Defour picks up a straight red on his first appearance of the tournament. The Porto midfielder is shown his marching orders for a double-footed challenge on Kim Shin-wook out on the right-hand side.

HALF-TIME: Belgium’s Premier League contingent have failed to make their dominance count, with Vertonghen guilty of wasting two well-positioned free-kicks. Their task has also been made harder by the dismissal of Defour late in the half.

Booking: Dembele has no complaints after being shown a yellow card for kicking the ball away

50mins – It's a silly booking for Dembele. The midfielder boots the ball away after fouling Koo Jacheol leaving the referee little choice but to show a yellow card.

56mins – Fellaini is caught as he bursts into the penalty area for Belgium but the referee fails to spot the contact and rather than a penalty, awards a goal-kick for South Korea.

60mins – SUBSTITUTION: Januzaj is replaced by Tottenham's Nacer Chadli, while 19-year-old striker Divock Origi comes on for Mertens. 

Cameo: Chadli made a positive contribution for the Red Devils after replacing Januzaj

64mins –  A brilliant challenge from Vertonghen stops Son from going clean through on goal for South Korea. The left-back covers his centre-backs by dropping in and stealing the ball from the forward with a perfectly-timed sliding tackle.

73mins – Chadli cuts in from the left and fires a shot towards the bottom corner, but it is deflected out for a corner by a sea of South Korea shirts.

77mins – GOAL: SOUTH KOREA 0-1 BELGIUM - Origi forces Kim Seunggyu into a smart stop but the goalkeeper cannot keep hold of the ball. He pushes it away and there is Vertonghen, following up Origi's initial effort, to whip the ball into the net from eight yards.

Composure: Vertonghen clips the winner over the South Korea goalkeeper after Origi's shot was saved

Pandemonium: Goalscorer Jan Vertonghen celebrates with Belgium fans after finding the net

83mins - Origi has been a breath of fresh air for Belgium and he wins a free-kick after another driving run at the hear of the South Korean defence.

88mins - SUBSTITUTION: Eden Hazard replaces Mirallas for the final few minutes. He doesn't take long to show his class, dancing past two tackles inside the South Korea and flashing a shot wide.

90mins - A last-ditch tackle from Fellaini inside his own penalty area stops

FULL-TIME: SOUTH KOREA 0-1 BELGIUM - Despite being reduced to 10 men on the brink of half-time, Spurs defender Vertonghen's well-taken late winner made it three wins from three group games for Wilmots' side. Januzaj performed well on his competitive debut for the Red Devils, while Mirallas was a constant torment for South Korea's defenders.
