Paul Scholes believes Steven Gerrard will have been unhappy to find himself rested and on the bench for Liverpool's Champions League clash with Real Madrid on Tuesday.

Seemingly with an eye on Saturday's Premier League clash with Chelsea at Anfield, Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers decided to rest a number of key players for the trip to the Bernabeu, including skipper Gerrard.

However, former Manchester United midfielder Scholes believes Gerrard retired from England duty in order to play in Liverpool's big European nights and told ITV: 'I think that's probably why he gave up international football, to play in games like this. I don't think he'll be happy tonight.

Scholes, who played over 130 games for the Red Devils in Europe, added that 34-year-old Gerrard is more than capable of playing in the Spanish capital on Tuesday before taking on Jose Mourinho's Blues in the Premier League four days later. 

'I think Steven Gerrard is capable of playing in this game and on Saturday (against Chelsea). It is Tuesday night, he'll have two-day recovery, train Friday, play Saturday and he's got a nice little two weeks off.' 

Asked what Liverpool' best plan of action was against the might of Madrid, Scholes replied before the game: 'Avoid a doing. Although it's highly likely with this team. Lee said Marcelo and Arbeloa are the weak links but they won't have to do much defending. Then you have (Toni) Kroos and (Luka) Modric controlling the game in the middle with (Cristiano) Ronaldo and (Karim) Benzema upfront.'

Meanwhile, Lee Dixon admitted Rodgers' decision to rest so many first-teamers was risky and hinted that those left out should probably have been left in England.

'It seems they are definitely prioritising for the Chelsea game,' said the former Arsenal defender. 

'Rodgers is trying to find the right balance between giving a performance and getting a result but it could be a risky prospect.

'If I'm a player I want to rest at home and rest properly rather than travelling.
