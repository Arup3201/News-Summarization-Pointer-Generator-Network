From extravagant ceremonies to simple rustic affairs, brides-to-be have very different ideas of what constitutes the 'perfect' day.

But what is constant in weddings across the world is a sense of romance - and, usually, an absence of football.

This was not the case for Kelly Cutting, 25. This 'lucky' lady was surprised on the big day by her football-mad husband, who decided to keep guests amused by showing off his ball skills.

Daniel Cutting, 26, entertained guests at his wedding ceremony with his 'keepy uppy' ability as he made his way down the aisle and while waiting for his bride to arrive.

A video of Daniel’s impressive display of ball skills at the Isle of White wedding has now gone viral, with 250,000 views so far.

While work is last thing on the mind of most grooms on their wedding day, professional football freestyler Daniel decided two weeks before the wedding he was going
 to 'thrill' his bride with the impressive display.

The former University of Bedfordshire student, said: 'At first this 
was just something I did as a hobby and something I loved to do growing 
up playing football.

'When I
 was about 16, I started to practise every day by balancing balls on my 
head and doing keepy uppies until it got to the point where I could 
easily do thousands of them.

'I
 didn’t think I could make a living out of it so I went to university 
and studied to be a PE teacher when I got recognised by agents.

'Since
 then I’ve won a UK competition and broken a few Guinness World Records.
 I’ve been doing this for five years now as a job and I love it.

'They’ve
 seen it thousands of times, as has Kelly. I told her I was going to 
show some tricks at the wedding but it isn’t new to her.

one of the best in the world and has smashed countless Guinness World 
Records for football tricks

The video of Daniel's performance at the wedding went viral after it was posted on Youtube, gaining over 250,000 views

His records include the fastest 100m sprint while balancing a football on his forehead, which he did in just 18.53 seconds.

Daniel, who is jetting off to Brazil, to work at the Rio World Cup, also holds the record for the most consecutive face rolls - rolling a football from temple to temple - where he beat the previous record three times over, with 1,810 rolls.

Daniel, of Milton Keynes, says his friends are jealous of his amazing job, which sees him travelling the globe for parties and events where he meets some of the world’s best football players.

He said: 'I travel all over the world doing different displays and corporate event and also provide entertainment at weddings and parties so I do a bit of everything.

'I get to work with so many famous stars because I work as a body double so I’ve met Arsenal player Olivier Giroud and Kaka, who now plays for Milan and a few other footballers, which is amazing.

Daniel says that although he has performed in front of crowds of  50,000 people before but that was the most scared I¿ve ever been.

'My mates are pretty jealous of what I do because I do something I love as a job and get to travel all over the world.

'I’ve already been to Barcelona twice this year and am going to Brazil for the World Cup for two weeks.

'The first week I’ll be working with a charity going to prisons and showing my performances. It’s really rewarding because it demonstrates to them my skills and has an effect on their lives.

'It makes them realise they can turn their lives around. The second week I have some filming for YouTube to do in Rio but it’ll be more like a holiday because I’m going with my dad and brother.

'I kept the whole thing pretty quiet and didn’t even think about doing it until about two weeks before when I overheard my mum saying "I bet he does some skills" and thought it would be fun.

'I wanted to make the most of the opportunity and do something very different that is a part of me and my job to entertain our guests.

While not a wedding for everyone, Daniel's skills certainly created some visually dramatic wedding snaps

'I was really nervous beforehand - probably the most nervous I’ve ever been - because it was my wedding day and I had so much other stuff to worry about, like being stood up at the altar.

'I’ve performed to crowds of about 50,000 people before but that was the most scared I’ve ever been.

'I’ve actually received mixed reviews from people who said the bride’s family didn’t look too impressed but that’s my family.'
