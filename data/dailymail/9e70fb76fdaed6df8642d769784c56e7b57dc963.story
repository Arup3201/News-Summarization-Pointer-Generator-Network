One of the hottest trends for autumn, according to Jean Paul Gaultier, is putting two fingers up to ageing gracefully.

His knockout show at Paris Fashion Week today featured elderly models with giant grey mohawks and silver bouffants rocking tartan kilts and biker jackets.

The French designer, 61, showed he's willing to push boundaries that bit further as he sent three ageing beauties down the runway.

One male model wore a embellished biker jacket and tartan kilt paired with leggings and Doc Marten style boots. He sported a giant silver nose ring and heavy black eyeliner, showing off his punk credentials. At one point he held up his umbrella in a defiant pose for photographers.

Meanwhile ladies were styled in space-age silver to match their glamorous hair styles. Model Catherine Loewe, 56, who sported a bouffant 'do, was styled in silver lame tench, tight sequin top cinched in with a silver belt and matching leggings.

Not one to be labelled ageist, Gaultier also featured three adorable children in his presentation.

A young girl styled like a traditional British queen complete with crown held hands with an adult female model as she walked to present a Gaultier frock. Meanwhile, two boys resembled 70s Brit punks like Sid Vicious, clad in biker jackets and with hair styled into mohawks.

The collection married the space and Brit-punk themes on occasion, by adding space helmets to Union Jack jumpers.

Held at French Communist venue Espace Oscar Niemeyer, the star-studded show, presenting menswear, childrenswear and womenswear, attracted A-list fashion fans Rihanna and Beth Ditto.
