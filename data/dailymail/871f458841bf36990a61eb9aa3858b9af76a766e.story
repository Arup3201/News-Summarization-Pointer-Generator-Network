Just hours after marking the disastrous conclusion of his mayoral campaign by flipping off news reporters, Anthony Weiner re-emerged in the spotlight with a smile on his face.

The former candidate appeared relaxed and in good spirits when a photographer caught up with him outside his apartment building on Park Avenue in Manhattan Wednesday.

The disgraced ex-congressman and sexting aficionado appeared to have rallied after his crushing defeat in the Democratic primaries, finishing his run with only 5 per cent.

Winning smile: Just hours after suffering a crushing defeat in the Democratic primaries, Anthony Weiner emerged from his apartment with a grin on his face and looking relaxed

Casual: Dressed in a white checkered button-down shirt and dark jeans, Mr Weiner appeared relaxed and in good spirits outside his home

Sporting a casual white checkered button-down shirt and dark jeans, Mr Weiner grinned and appeared animated while being photographed outside his home.

On Wednesday, there was also a sighting of Mr Weiner's better half, Huma Abedin, who chose to skip his concession party the night before in favor of a Hamptons getaway – and in the process avoided running into her husband’s sexting partner.

The mayoral candidate's wife emerged from the couple's tony apartment building this morning dressed to impress in a mint-green dress with a Louis Vuitton bag on her shoulder, and attempted to hail a cab, the New York Daily News reported. 

Miss Abedin largely disappeared from the public eye following revelations that her husband had continue exchanging X-rated messages with Sidney Leathers long after his resignation from the U.S. Congress.

Another long-suffering spouse who was back in the spotlight one day after her husband's defeat was Silda Spitzer, who was photographed walking out of her Manhattan penthouse with a walking cast on her right leg.

Now that her estranged husband's campaign for the office of comptroller is over, Mrs Spitzer allegedly plans to begin divorce proceedings, according to the New York Post. On Wednesday, she was depicted carrying an envelope under her arm bearing her husband's name.

Poor showing: Weiner finished his race with only 5 per cent of the vote, knocking him out of contention for the mayor of New York City

What's next? With his reputation thoroughly tarnished by a sexting scandal, it remains to be seen if Mr Weiner would run for public office in the future

Tuesday was a bad night for philandering New York City politicians, with both Mr Weiner and Mr Spitzer suffering loses in their respective primary races. 

Weiner concluded his race by showing the middle finger to the reporters who covered his scandal-ridden campaign.

His wife Huma Abedin was not looking on as he gave his concession, and he didn't even thank his long-plagued wife in his remarks. Abedin was said to be hundreds of miles away in the Hamptons on Tuesday night but spotted coming out of the couple's Manhattan apartment Wednesday morning. 

Rather than bowing out gracefully, Weiner decided to throw one final insult at the voters by flipping his middle finger at the crowd as he drove off as captured by NY1 photographers.

Instead of having his wife at the midtown bar where he and his supporters gathered Tuesday night, a different woman was attracting attention: Sydney Leathers, the woman with whom he had a sexting relationship, crashed his party.

The mood was notably happier in Brooklyn where former public advocate Bill de Blasio celebrated his victory alongside his family, with the whole crew dancing next to one another in front of a cheering crowd.

Democratic mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner leaves after making his concession speech at Connolly's Pub in Midtown Tuesday, September 10

Sydney Leathers, who engaged in online sex chats with Democratic mayoral hopeful Anthony Weiner last summer, tries to enter his election gathering place at Connolly's Pub in New York Tuesday

'Sadly we did not win this time, but I
could not be more proud of the campaign that we ran,' Weiner said to 
the crowd inside Connolly's Irish Pub just before 11 p.m., accepting his
defeat with just 5 percent of the vote. 'I 
could not be more proud of you.'

He went on: 'We had the best ideas. Sadly, I was an imperfect messenger.'

Leathers was seen wandering around the pub- clearly as an uninvited  guest- giving statements to reporters 
and showing off her widely publicized plastic surgeries including a breast augmentation and a nose job.

Her presence delayed the evening's festivities as it took Weiner half an hour to avoid a confrontation and run through a nearby fast food restaurant.

After stepping down from Congress in 2011 following his first sexting scandal, Weiner was 
hoping that his campaign for mayor would be his chance to reenter public
office and clear his name. The July revelations that he continued having inappropriate online relationships with women, including Leathers.

It wasn't work: Longtime Clinton aide Huma Abedin was in the Hamptons but not with her boss, as former Secretary of State and likely presidential hopeful Hillary was at an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday

New Yorkers also voted against 
another scandal-plagued politician on Tuesday as former New York 
Governor Eliot Spitzer lost his race for city comptroller.

Even
though he and Weiner were dealt the similar losses, Spitzer had a much 
more successful campaign as he came within 4 points of Scott Stringer, 
the former Manhattan Borough President who has worked in state politics 
for the past two decades.

Stringer had a 
52-percent-to-48-per cent lead over Spitzer in unofficial 
returns, with 92 percent of precincts reporting.

'I am proud to have run a campaign 
over the past nine weeks that many thought was incapable to mount,' 
Spitzer said in his concession speech.

'We did it in a way that made me 
proud to revisit the issues we fought for when I was attorney general 
and governor, to lay out an agenda of what we believed was right for 
this great city.'

'I say to the public, I am proud to have served,' he added.

Spitzer - who like Weiner, is married - was forced to resign five years ago after he admitted to hiring prostitutes.

His wife Silda Spitzer was not at the Tuesday night event and never made any campaign appearances during his nine-week bid for comptroller.

'All along we knew it was going to be a close race,' Spitzer campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith told MailOnline at his party Tuesday night.

'Yes people know Eliot and he has name recognition but Scott Stringer has the entire political establishment behind him- every union, every business.'

Striking a clear contrast to his failed colleagues, Bill de Blasio danced and blew simultaneous kisses to the crowd with his wife and two children at their victory party in Gowanus, Brooklyn.

De Blasio won 40.2 per cent of the Democratic vote, and while there is a chance of a run off between him and the second place candidate, Bill Thompson, that seems unlikely.

'You made this campaign a cause, and I say thank you for elevating it to that level,' the former public advocate said to his supporters.

Victory: Even though second-place candidate Bill Thompson refused to concede saying that there will be a run off, Bill de Blasio (pictured) celebrated his 40.2 per cent victory

Coordinated: Bill and his wife Chirlane McCray blew simultaneous kisses at the crowd

Happy: De Blasio's family was a much of his campaign as he was, with son Dante and daughter Chiara joining him on stage Tuesday night at their victory party

De Blasio's interracial family was displayed prominently throughout the campaign as he featured his son Dante and his large afro in a number of television ads while his daughter Chiara frequently spoke on her father's behalf at events, including the victory party last night.

'Some of you may already be familiar with my brother Dante. My brother, my little brother, may look good on TV – but there's only one de Blasio who got to vote for her dad today,' she said, referring to a clip of her condemning current mayor Michael Bloomberg's comments about de Blasio using his family as a part of the campaign.

While many have pegged De Blasio as the 'populist' candidate who will be facing Republican Joe Lhota in November, Dante is undoubtedly the fan-favorite as he had a round of cheers all his own at the Brooklyn party.

'In her enthusiasm Chiara just attempted to touch the hair. Security was ready to intervene,' Mr De Blasio joked.
