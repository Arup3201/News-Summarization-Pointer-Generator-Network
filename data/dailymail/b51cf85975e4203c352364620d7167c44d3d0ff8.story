Nick Clegg was accused of not being ‘straight’ over the Lord Rennard scandal yesterday as he shifted his story yet again.

The Deputy Prime Minister said sexual harassment claims against the former Liberal Democrat chief executive had been a factor in his early retirement – ostensibly on health grounds – in 2009.

Mr Clegg said allegations of improper  conduct towards women had been ‘in the background’ when it was decided Lord Rennard would step down, though the party insisted at the time that the only reason was his poor health.

Hosting his weekly radio phone-in, Nick Clegg was challenged to explain when he first knew of claims about Lord Rennard's 'inappropriate behaviour'

He also confirmed that a former Lib 
Dem frontbencher, Sandra Gidley, had raised concerns about the peer’s 
behaviour with him soon after he became leader in 2007, though he 
insisted she had not raised specific allegations.

At least 10 women are thought to have made allegations that they were molested or pestered by Lord Rennard

Mr Clegg’s office initially suggested 
he knew nothing of claims against Lord Rennard, who categorically denies
impropriety, when alleged victims went public last week. Then they 
admitted he had been aware of rumours, which he had asked his then chief
of staff to investigate.

In an unusually forthright attack for a
senior Conservative on their coalition partners, Business Minister 
Michael Fallon said it was increasingly clear that the Lib Dems had not 
been ‘straight’ about what they knew.

‘I think one of the reasons the Lib 
Dems are in trouble is they haven’t really been straight about this. The
reason it’s gone on for a week is first they said it wasn’t happening 
and they only heard it in general terms, now they’ve said they have 
heard the specific allegations, now they’re saying it was something to 
do with the reason why Lord Rennard resigned,’ Mr Fallon said.

‘And when this sort of thing happens, I
think the lesson is really you’ve got to come clean right at the 
beginning and get a more independent inquiry and get the facts out there
and, when necessary, put it right and that hasn’t happened – this has 
gone on far too long.’ 

Alison Smith, a former Lib Dem activist, went public with groping claims against Lord Rennard and has criticised Mr Clegg's attacks on journalist as 'self-appointed detectives'

Former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw 
agreed: ‘Clegg seems to be changing the story every time he’s asked.’

But Baroness Williams, one of the most
senior Lib Dem women, said the situation had been ‘hopelessly 
exaggerated’ and insisted Lord Rennard was ‘a very fine man’.

However, she did say that women in 
Parliament were ‘not treated very fairly’ and said the Commons was a 
‘very bullying place, a very masculine culture’.

Mr Clegg himself paid lavish tribute 
to Lord Rennard when he retired in 2009, declaring: ‘It is impossible to
exaggerate Chris’s immense contribution to the Liberal Democrats over 
the years.’

Pressed on whether the allegations 
played any part in Lord Rennard’s departure as chief executive, Mr Clegg
yesterday told listeners of his weekly phone in show on LBC 97.3: ‘Like
any new leader of any organisation or political party, I wanted to make
sure that the organisation reflected my priorities, my values.

Mr Clegg has been trailled by reporters since the scandal broke

‘I felt it was time for a change at 
the top of the professional party. His health was poor and that was the 
immediate reason he left but of course these things were in the 
background.’

The Deputy Prime Minister also shifted from his indignant 
response to criticism earlier in the scandal, conceding his party failed
to deal properly with complaints of sexual harassment.

‘There were some very serious mistakes
and the women were not listened to and were let down,’ Mr Clegg said.

‘I so much believe that it is crucial that you treat people with respect
and dignity in everything you do – and that is what I expect of people 
in the organisation I lead. That, clearly, did not happen here, to put 
it mildly.’

Mr Clegg also praised journalists who 
had helped expose the affair, having on Tuesday triggered anger by 
rounding on ‘people who appear to want to act as self-appointed 
detectives trying to piece together events that happened many years 
ago’.

Of the media, he insisted that as a liberal he would ‘defend to my last breath their right to say what they want’.
