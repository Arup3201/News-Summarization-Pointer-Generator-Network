An American veterinarian is trapped in East Timor after she was accused of drug trafficking, a crime she says she didn't commit.

UC Berkeley grad Dr. Stacey Addison, was traveling from Indonesian territory to independent East Timor on September 5 when she was arrested.

The vet spent five terrifying days in jail and was forced to surrender her passport. Now she's been freed but can't leave the impoverished Southeast Asian nation. 

In flux: 40-year-old Portland, Oregon veterinarian Dr. Stacey Addison was detained in East Timor and set free, but authorities took her passport and expect her to stay in the country during an investigation that could take a year

Drug charge: Addison says a man she shared a taxi with on September 5 was caught with a package of methamphetamine and she was arrested along with him

The 40-year-old from Portland, Oregon has now been trying to get home for weeks. She's been in contact with American news outlets via Skype despite her shaky internet connection.

'I'm a suspect in a crime I didn't commit,' she told KGO. 'I don't know what's going to happen with the case, so it just makes everything really scary.'

Authorities in East Timor strip-searched Addison and took a urine sample upon her arrest.

She says she knew she had no drugs and that her drug test would be negative, so at first she wasn't too worried.

'I thought, OK, I haven’t done anything. It should be OK. But it’s not,' she told KOIN.

After days of sleeping on a floor with 13 other women in jail and her subsequent release without a passport, the worry set in.

Initial pleas to the U.S. Embassy were fruitless because diplomats aren't allowed to interfere with a foreign crime investigation. 

Holding out hope: Addison, who's often traveled abroad to do volunteer work as a vet, has been in touch with American media via a shaky internet connection. She says she's been in contact with her U.S. Senator and some diplomatic officials

'I haven't committed a crime, I've done nothing wrong and the facts will prove that,' she said, but, 'their system is different here in that they have a long period to investigate and I'm sort of stuck in this.'

While things appeared hopeless, by Tuesday leaders from both the state of Oregon and from East Timor had become 'aware of the situation' according to what Addison told KOIN.

In addition to the foreign minister and prime minister, Addison said she's in touch with the office of U.S. Senator Jeff Merkley’s office via email and hopes the case will be resolved sooner rather than later.

She said she's been told such investigations are known to take up to a year.

'I’m not asking that they have special treatment,' she said. 'I’m just asking that they look at the evidence. There isn’t any evidence.'
