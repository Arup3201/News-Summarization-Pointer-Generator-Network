Novak Djokovic made a ruthless start to the defence of his ATP World Tour Finals title as he beat Marin Cilic in just 56 minutes.

The world No 1 dominated proceedings throughout at the O2 Arena with a 6-1, 6-1 victory, which is his 28th win in a row on an indoor court.

Djokovic said: 'It was a great performance. I was hoping I could play this way. I was preparing myself for this match. I knew already one week ago that I was going to play Marin.

'You could see that he didn't feel so comfortable. I tried to use my experience playing on this stage, the stadium, which is pretty different from any other.' 

Djokovic had won all ten of his previous meetings against Cilic and never at any point on Monday night did it look like this particular contest would end any differently.

The first break of the match came in the third game with US Open champion Cilic nervously putting a forehand wide as he faced break point.

Two stunning forehand cross-court passes helped Djokovic seal the double break for 4-1 and a tame Cilic backhand into the net ended a 27-minute first set.

Another Cilic error saw Djokovic claim the early break in the second set, although he did halt the Serb's run of eight straight games as he immediately broke back with a blistering forehand down the line.

Hopes of a possible Cilic revival were swiftly ended, however, as the Croat sprayed yet more groundstrokes and Djokovic won four games in a row to seal a comfortable victory.

Two more wins in the round-robin stage for Djokovic will see him secure the year-end No 1 ranking and he looks odds on to do so given his dominance under a roof in the last two years.

Djokovic next faces Stan Wawrinka on Wednesday in what will be their first meeting since the Swiss won a thrilling Australian Open quarter-final back in January.
