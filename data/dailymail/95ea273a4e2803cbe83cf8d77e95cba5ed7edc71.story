Manchester United attacking midfielder Juan Mata has been linked with a move to Juventus following talk of Arturo Vidal's apparent unrest at the Serie A giants.

Vidal is said to have become unsettled at the club after he was fined £78,400 for getting into an altercation on a night out ahead of his side's encounter against Roma last Sunday. 

Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport claim Juventus will look to replace the Chilean international with Mata.
