General Motors has admitted that at least 23 people have died and 16 were seriously injured after the ignition switch failed on one of its popular car models. 

The Detroit car maker has established a compensation scheme after it acknowledged the faulty part in its Chevrolet Cobalt and other small cars. 

The faulty switch had been identified more than ten years ago but the firm only initiated a recall in February. 

Attorney Kenneth Feinberg, who is running the compensation scheme for GM said two additional claims were settled over the past week, bringing the total to 23. 

Trenton Buzard, 7, received an undisclosed compensation payout after he was paralysed when his great grand mother's Chevrolet Cobalt careered out of control when the ignition switch failed

It is understood GM has received 153 death claims and 714 injury claims following their admission.  

The switches can slip out of the 'on' position, which causes the cars to stall, knocks out power steering and turns off the air bags.

The company has set aside $400 million to cover compensation payments, but Feinberg believes that figure could grow to $600 million. 

Among the most recent cases settled is that of seven year old Trenton Buzard, from New Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. 

He was paralysed when the car being driven by his great grandmother Esther Matthews lost control due to the faulty switch and ploughed into another vehicle on April 2, 2009.

Two families from Wisconsin have accepted a settlement offer from General Motors after two teenagers were killed in their cars in a crash caused by a faulty ignition switch.

Amy Rademaker, 15,  and Natasha Weigel, 17, were killed with the Chevy Cobalt they were passenger in crashed. A fault with the car's ignition switch turned off vital systems such as the power steering and airbags moments before the crash. 

The company knew about the fault, which affected more than two million cars before the accident in 2006 but failed to initiate a recall to fix the problem.

The girls' family accepted the offer after they dropped a lawsuit against the Detroit car giant which could have hidden behind bankruptcy protection in the event of a court case. 

Margie Beskau, mother of Ms Rademaker told CNBC: 'No amount of money can bring my daughter back. But I'm ready to be done with this.' 

Ms Beskau, from Woodville, Wisconsin said she feared the company would have invoked its bankruptcy protection if the case had been brought to court. 

'We just felt we'd come out better financially and emotionally if we went ahead and settled. There was no guarantee we would win, so this seemed like the right decision to make.'

Ms Beskau's daughter was sitting in the passenger seat of the 2005 Chevy Cobalt when the vehicle lost all power due to the defective ignition switch in October 2006. The car careered off the road smashing into some trees. 

Due to the fault, many of the car's safety systems failed. 

GM only initiated a recall of the 2.6 million cars fitted with the faulty switches earlier this year.  

The company has admitted it knew about the flawed switches for at least a decade before issuing a recall. The switches can unexpectedly slip into the 'accessory' position, shutting off the engine and disabling key features such as power-assisted steering, and the car's air bags. Congress and the Justice Department are investigating GM's handling of the recall.

The car's driver, Megan Phillips, also a plaintiff in the lawsuit, survived the crash but suffered permanent brain damage. The data recorder in her 2005 Cobalt showed that the ignition switch was in 'accessory' at the time of the crash.

A Wisconsin state trooper investigating the crash made the connection between the defective switch and the air bags not deploying. A report commissioned by GM, and a separate report from a Congressional committee on the role of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said both the company and regulators were aware of the trooper's finding but largely ignored it for years. 

The automaker has set aside $400 million in its compensation fund and may pay out up to $600 million.
