A 32-year-old middle school teacher has been accused of raping a 13-year-old boy after he accepted a 'dare' to contact her and visit her home.

Mary Faith McCormick, a married mother-of-one, was arrested after one of the boy's friends allegedly found semi-nude photos of the teacher on the boy's phone.

Police then carried out an investigation and allegedly uncovered the three-month affair between the teacher and the underage boy.

The sixth grade teacher at Siloam Springs Intermediate School in Benton County, Arkansas, is also accused of sending the boy sexually explicit text messages and photos, KFSM reported.

Arrest: Married school teacher Mary Faith McCormick, pictured left in her mug shot and right, stands accused of having sex with a 13-year-old student. She also allegedly sent him explicit text messages and photos

According to a probable cause affidavit the two had consensual sex at least twice.

The sexual encounters began after a friend 'dared' the 13-year-old to contact McCormick.

The report said the teen and a friend went over to the teacher's apartment to watch a movie.

When the friend left, the boy remained behind and later had sex with the teacher in her bedroom, the affidavit states.

Police said the teacher and the teen sent each other 'snap chat' messages of each other's genitalia. They also exchanged explicit text messages.

Investigators said they had collected electronic messages between the pair. Two USB thumb drives, an iPad and two Apple iphones and desktop computer were seized from McCormick's home.

Married: McCormick, who is pictured with her husband, allegedly had sex with the boy at her home

Caught: Another student, aged just 12, found a photo of the teacher wearing just a towel on the boy's phone

Police launched their investigation after a 12-year-old girl friend of the boy borrowed his cell phone and discovered one of the messages which showed the teacher in nothing but a towel, according to KFSM 5 News.

Further examination of the iPhone revealed a photo of McCormick topless.

The affidavit says an eye witness saw several inappropriate messages and photos, including one with McCormick with wet hair and showing off her breasts.

The text with the risque photo said: 'I'm not dirty anymore.'

McCormick's Facebook page shows she has a husband and a young daughter and reveals her father is a teacher in the same school district.

Workplace: She is a sixth grade language arts teacher at Siloam Springs Middle School in Arkansas, pictured, but she has been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation

School superintendent said McCormick was suspended on full pay.

She was held overnight in Benton County Jail before being released on Thursday on $50,000 bail.

The probable cause affidavit said the two had consensual sex at least twice between June and August.

Under Arkansas law, 'consensual' sex between an adult and an underage minor is considered rape because the minor cannot legally consent.

Her next court date is in September.
