A rabbi from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania is being sued for severing a newborn baby's penis during a botched Bris ceremony.

Rabbi Mordechai Rosenberg, who is also a mohel, performed the ceremony at The Tree Of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill earlier this year on April 28.

The Huffington Post reported that the parents have remained anonymous to protect the identity of their son.

Rabbi Mordechai Rosenberg is a rabbi, and a mohel who claimed to be 'trained,' yet managed to accidentally dismember a baby's penis

The newborn baby boy had to be rushed to Children's Hospital where doctors performed an emergency micro-surgery to reattach the dismembered penis.

CBS reported that the boy needed six blood transfusions and was hospitalized for two months. The delicate surgery took about eight hours long.

CBS spoke with a plastic surgeon named Doctor Joe Losee about the process of micro surgery.

'If your finger, your thumb was cut off and was put back on, that is pretty exciting,' Losee said.

'Sometimes, it doesn’t always work,' he says. “When you’re reattaching a portion where you include nerves, sometimes the nerves don’t heal well beyond where you reattached it. So there are limitations for sure.'

The baby's microsurgery was reported 'successful', but whether or not the baby will have problems later on in life is still unknown.

Despite the gruesome incident, the rabbi still practices as a mohel.

CBS spoke with attorney David Llewellyn who handles cases pertaining to botched circumcisions by either a mohel or a doctor.

There is no regulated method for training mohel's that perform the bris

'That is extraordinarily serious and is extraordinarily rare,' said attorney David Llewellyn.

He spoke of how Bris services are usually unregulated.

'There’s virtually no regulation of this any place in the United States that I know of,' Llewellyn said. 'I think the government probably should require some sort of training if this is going to be done.'

'Your average pediatric urologist probably spends about 20 percent of his or her time repairing children who have been circumcised,' Llewellyn told CBS.

According to Rosenberg's website, 'The Bris must be performed by a Jewish person who understands, upholds, and practices the tenets of the Jewish religion, and is specially trained to function as a mohel.'

Rosenberg claims he is well trained in circumcision and calls this case a 'tragic accident.'

He also claims that receiving a Bris in a hospital may not be recognized under Jewish law.

Mayor Bloomberg has spoken out about medical circumcision following 11 herpes outbreaks in 2001 in New York in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish circumcision ritual called metzitzah b’peh — or oral suction — in which the mohel puts his mouth directly on the newborn’s circumcised penis and sucks out the blood.

The mohel had transmitted herpes to the children.

Bloomberg wrote an open latter to mohel's asking them to move away from the ceremony.
