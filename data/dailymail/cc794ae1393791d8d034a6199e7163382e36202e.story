The pressure on Marks & Spencer is set to increase this week when the retailer confirms yet another drop in clothing sales.

Britain’s biggest clothing retailer is expected to report an eleventh straight fall in clothing sales, despite attempts to revive its fortunes with an expensive advertising campaign.

The 130-year old group is on Thursday forecast by City analysts to reveal a fall in sales of general merchandise - which includes clothing footwear and homewares - of 1pc in the three months to the end of March.

It has also launched a ‘Leading Ladies’ advertising campaign to win over its Middle England clientele. This features a wide range of women from disparate careers and backgrounds, including actress Emma Thompson and Stephen Lawrence’s campaigning mother Doreen.

Abroad: Marks & Spencer is now looking to open stores in the Middle East and India to boost profits

M&S is now looking further afield for its profits and plans to open 250 new stores outside the UK  - including in Europe, the Middle East and India - over the next three years.

But it has been forced to admit defeat in its attempts to expand across China.

US investment banking giant Goldman Sachs recently signalled its concerns about the prospects for M&S, downgrading its recommendation for the company’s shares to a ‘conviction sell’.

The decline in clothing sales has seen M&S lose ground to arch rival Next, which has reported stellar sales.
