On Friday December 14, Becky Kowalski suffered what she called the 'worst day of my life' when she found out her seven-year-old son had been gunned down at his elementary school.

But on Sunday, just two days later, she experienced the 'best day of my life' when the boy, Chase, came to her in a vision and assured her his life had not been taken for nothing.

Becky has claimed that the boy's visit assured her that a fund set up in his honour would save lives, change building codes, foster gun control and
'bring God back to America.'

She said that while the Chase Kowalski Scholarship Fund is still in the early stages, 'after I received that vision from Chase, my 
sadness left me and I have been strong since'.

'He’ll stay alive through 
the work this organization does and I will never let people forget Chase
or any of the other 19 children who were lost that day,' she told the New York Daily News.

Her husband, Stephen, said he too felt at peace after the vision.

'I'm
completely on board,' he said. 'I believe my son did visit his 
mom. I have never before seen a look on Becky’s face like that morning. I
believe now that things like that can happen.

'I was amazed at the peace
and strength Becky received from that vision. She's transferred it to 
me. I’m at peace now, too. Feeling strong.'

He added that immediately after learning about the vision, he went straight to the bank and set up the Chase Kowalski Scholarship Fund.

Beloved: Chase was remembered as a 'fun-loving, energetic boy' who loved sports and his family

Family: Chase leaves behind his two older sisters, Brittany, left, and Erin, and his parents Becky and Stephen

Chase
Kowalski was one of the 26 victims killed by a gunman who forced his 
way into Sandy Hook Elementary School on Friday morning and opened fire.

Chase's
mother was just leaving a kickboxing class when she heard a radio broadcast about an incident at the school and called a friend, who said 
something bad was happening.

'I
remember taking my towel and putting it over my mouth,' she told the 
Daily News. 'I started freaking out. Then I calmed myself down.'

After contacting her husband, who 
started driving towards the school, Becky's friend called her to say 
that none of the children had been hurt but that they were being taken 
to a safe location.

On 
learning that the youngsters were being collected from the firehouse 
next to the school, Becky  raced to the scene. But while she saw other 
parents with their children, she could not see Chase.

Loved: Seven-year-old Chase Kowalski, one of the Sandy Hook Elementary School victims, came to his mother in a vision to assure her that his life had not been taken for nothing, she has said

Energetic: His family added that he loved playing baseball with his dad and was part of the Cub Scouts

Beloved: Chase's parents remember their fear at not being able to see him in the crowd at Sandy Hook school

'I
started asking them, "Did you see Chase? Did you see Chase?" I was 
starting to panic,' she said. 'Then I asked my friend Lisa if she’d seen
Chase. She said, "I think I saw him." I said, "Okay, okay."

'That
gave me the pause I needed, the hope that kept me from losing it, from 
plunging into total despair. It was a gift Lisa gave me at that critical
moment to know that she thought she saw my son.'

State troopers gathered parents of children from one of the first-grade classes and told them to wait in a room in the firehouse.

While authorities did not tell them 
that 20 children were dead, Stephen said he had heard the figure 
on the radio as he raced to the firehouse to meet his wife.

'Then I got to the 
firehouse and the troopers made me sign a sheet of paper,' he remembered. 'I counted the 
signatures. There were 20 signatures. I had a sense then that my son was
gone.'

Becky hoped that 
her son was among the children who were injured in hospital, but 
when troopers told the families that the two children in hospital had 
died, she knew her son was gone.

'And
then Gov. (Dannel) Malloy came out and gave a speech and said he wasn’t
gonna take any questions from the families of the dead kids,' Stephen 
said, which confirmed that their son had died.

After they learned that their son, 
who they described as their 'funny little guy', had passed away, they 
spent the weekend mourning with their two older children, Brittany and 
Erin, until the vision occurred.

The family is now focusing on taking good from the bad. Contributions can be sent to the Chase Kowalski Scholarship Fund c/o People's Bank, 470 Monroe Turnpike, Monroe, CT 06468.

On Wednesday, hundreds of mourners attended a memorial for Chase in Monroe, Connecticut.

In
a statement, his family said: 'Chase was an amazing son, brother, and 
grandson whose heart was only filled with love for all the people he 
touched.

'He was a fun-loving, energetic boy that had a true love of life. He completed his first triathlon at the age of six and ran in many community road races.

'Chase had a deep love for the game of baseball and enjoyed practicing with his father and teammates. Joining the Cub Scouts was just one of his many interests. He could often be found in the yard playing ball, riding his bike or quad.'
