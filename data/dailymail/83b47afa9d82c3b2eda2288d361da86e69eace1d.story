Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel landed himself in hot water once again as he gave a middle-finger salute to the Washington Redskins bench during a pre-season game.

The rookie - whose off-the-field partying ways have earned him a 'bad boy' reputation - was filmed running and making the obscene gesture during the third quarter of the game, which was televised live in America on ESPN's Monday Night Football.

After the game, Manziel acknowledged that he had made a mistake.

He told ESPN: 'I get words exchanged with me. I should have been smarter. It's Monday Night Football. I had a lapse of judgement.'

In the wrong: Manziel admitted that he made a mistake with his middle finger gesture

Browns head coach Mike Pettine added: 'It did not sit well. I was informed of it after the game and it's disappointing. Because what we talk about it being poised and being focused - that you have to be able to maintain your poise.'

The Cleveland Browns were beaten 24-23 at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland.

Manziel, who played his college football for Texas A&M, was drafted with the No 22 pick by the Cleveland Browns in the 2014 NFL Draft.

The 21-year-old is battling Brian Hoyer for the Browns' starting quarterback role this season.

Manziel, though, was forced to admit to 'rookie mistakes' after he was often seen partying during the off-season.
