Chimpanzees learn kindness by watching and experiencing the compassion of others, a new study suggests.

Scientists claim it’s the first evidence that both children and chimps share common traits of altruism that are learned from the sociable behaviour of peers.

The study seems to offer fresh evidence of the evolutionary roots of kindness in humans and non-human primates.

Compassionate: Chimpanzees (pictured) learn kindness by watching and experiencing the compassion of others, a new study suggests. Scientists claim it’s the first evidence that both children and chimps share common traits of altruism that are learned from the sociable behaviour of peers

Researchers from the University of St Andrews and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, demonstrated that contrary to earlier findings, in certain conditions, primates display similar behaviour to humans.

Professor Andrew Whiten explained: ‘A regard for the welfare of others is seen as a cardinal human virtue. By contrast, several recent scientific studies have concluded that the same dispositions are lacking in our closest living primate relatives.

‘The results of our research provide the first evidence that both children and chimpanzees share common traits of altruism that are learned as a direct result of experiencing the kindness of others.’

His team studied and compared the ‘prosocial’ actions of children aged between four and eight years old, as well as those of adults, chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys, according to the study, published in Nature’s Scientific Reports.

They came to their conclusion after conducting experiments with pairs of chimpanzees (left), monkeys, children (right) and adults, which involved them rewarding each other with food in boxes. Researchers were interested in whether participants provided rewards to others, as well as the quality of the rewards

The researchers studied the ‘prosocial’ actions of children aged between four and eight years old, as well as those of adults, chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys.

They defined it as voluntary actions that benefit individuals or society, such as helping, sharing and co-operating with others.

Such actions are considered essential for maintaining effective communities, offering immediate benefit and encouraging mutual exchange in the future.

Motivating factors for prosocial actions include empathy, which is recognised to have deep evolutionary roots, altruism, practical considerations and self-interest.

The study revealed that like children, chimpanzees learn kindness – a prosocial behaviour - by watching and experiencing the compassion of others.

They defined prosocial behaviour as voluntary actions that benefit individuals or society, such as helping, sharing and co-operating with others.

Such actions are considered essential for maintaining effective communities, offering immediate benefit and encouraging mutual exchange in the future.

For the study, participants were paired within each species and the responses of individuals accessing food rewards were analysed.

Researchers were interested in whether participants provided rewards to others and the quality of the rewards.

They discovered that that young children and capuchin monkeys didn’t display any prosocial traits in certain situations, but that human adults gave their partner a more preferred reward even when they could only receive the less preferred reward. 

Some children and chimpanzees who didn’t show kindness were partnered with others who showed generous behaviour towards them.

They were later found to act more kindly themselves and were more likely to reward others.

Professor Whiten said: ‘We believe our study is the first to demonstrate that the prosocial behaviour of humans and non-human primates is shaped by the everyday social actions of those around them.

‘Kindness may thrive, evolve and inspire when helping, sharing or donating are part of the cultural experience.'

The chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys were studied at the University of Texas and the University of St Andrews’ research centre in Edinburgh Zoo.

In the experiment, pairs of chimps, monkeys, children and adults chose whether or not to reward each other with treats

Study found that adults did but monkeys and young children didn't

Children and chimps learned kind behaviour off more generous individuals
