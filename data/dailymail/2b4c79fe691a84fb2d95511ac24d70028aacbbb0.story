Barrington Armstrong-Thorpe was jailed for selling banned tooth whitening gel

A conman who sold potentially dangerous tooth-whitening gel which contained up to 100 times the legal level of cleaning chemical hydrogen peroxide has been jailed for 16 months.

Barrington Armstrong-Thorpe, 68, was found guilty of eight consumer protection offences after a judge told him he had 'lied' his way through a week-long trial.

Armstrong-Thorpe, from Clacton, Essex, who is known to have used 17 aliases, had bought the gel for his online company Brighter Smile Marketing from America and claimed on its websites that the product complied with EU laws.

The websites, brightersmile.co.uk and
smilebrighternow.com, also failed to include information identifying 
the trader or the customer's consumer rights.

Essex
Trading Standards officers tested the whitening syringes and analysis 
showed that they were 69, 89 and 100 times over the EU permitted limit 
of 0.1 per cent hydrogen peroxide.

Armstrong-Thorpe had denied the charges but was found guilty on all counts at Chelmsford Crown Court.

Sentencing the trader, Judge Karen Walden Smith said: 'I have never heard someone lie as you did with barely a pause for breath.

'The business was organised for the purpose of making money and to do so you lied and lied without concern for the public.

'Your concern throughout has been your profit.'

The
court heard that Armstrong-Thorpe, who appeared in court on crutches 
because of a bad back, had received 190,000 US dollars in a PayPal 
account between 2007 and 2010, the only figure that prosecutors could 
establish.

He began selling the kits, which costs 'tens of pounds', in 2004 and thousands of customers purchased them.

But despite those sales, Barry 
Gilbert, mitigating, said that not much money had been made from the 
product and that Armstrong-Thorpe had been declared bankrupt.

He added that the product had worked as customers had continuously reordered and said that no complaints had ever been made.

A
spokesman for Essex Trading Standards however, said peroxide was 
absorbed through the teeth into the body and it was not known what long 
term damage could be caused by excessive levels.

Armstrong-Thorpe,
who described himself as a chiropractor and had arranged for his dog to
be put down as he knew a prison term was likely, had previously served 
four years in a Los Angeles jail for perjury in 1993 and has a list of 
offences going back to 1967, the court heard.

Armstrong-Thorpe had bought the teeth whitening kits from America and despite thousands of customers buying them, was declared bankrupt according to defence lawyers

Since his conviction an announcement 
had been posted on the Smilebrighter website stating: 'Unfortunately due
to circumstances beyond our control we have had to suspend orders for a
short while.

'We will be back shortly as soon as we can sort the problem out.'

Essex
Councillor Kevin Bentley, who is responsible for Trading Standards in 
the county, warned after the verdict: 'Using unfamiliar websites to 
purchase unfamiliar goods for a cheap price may put you at risk.

'Teeth whitening gel such as this could cause permanent damage and be extremely expensive to put right.'

'This conviction should act as a warning to other traders who may be trying to make money by selling these illegal goods.

'You will be caught and potentially get a prison sentence.'

He was found guilty of eight separate offences relating to two different websites, one is pictured

The websites showed before and after pictures of people who it claimed had used the tooth whitening kits
