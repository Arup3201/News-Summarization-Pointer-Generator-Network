Beyonce and Jay-Z caused a big stir in Havana as they marked their fifth wedding anniversary on Thursday.

R&B's power couple were mobbed by dozens of well-wishers as they stepped out together to enjoy a celebratory lunch and sightseeing in the Cuban capital.

The 31-year-old singer cut a striking image, with her hair styled into cornrows.

She was wearing a patterned yellow ensemble which showed off her legs while rapper Jay-Z, 43, looked like the quintessential tourist in shorts, a blue T-shit and hat.

Power couple: Beyonce and Jay-Z stepped out in Havana, Cuba, on Thursday as they dined out for lunch to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary

The couple - who married Paris on April 4, 2008 - toured colonial
 Old Havana wearing dark glasses and were surrounded by bodyguards and 
excited fans.

Beyonce posed for pictures with local schoolchildren while
 Jay-Z puffed on a Cuban cigar, and then they popped into another 
restaurant that boasts a rooftop terrace with a sweeping view of the harbour.

Beyonce and 
Jay-Z declined to speak to reporters, and it was not clear why they 
travelled to Cuba. State-run website CubaSi called it a tourist trip.

Washington's
 51-year embargo makes it illegal for U.S. citizens to visit Cuba for 
mere tourism, although tens of thousands of Americans travel there each 
year on academic, religious, journalistic or cultural exchange visas.

The Obama administration eased many of the restrictions in 2011, but tourists still need a special visa or to be part of an organized tour.

In the past, artists who were challenged by the government have said 
they visited for cultural purposes.

On Wednesday evening the pair dined 
out at the renowned restaurant La Guarida - and police had to step in to
 keep the crowds at bay.

La Guarida staffers showed The 
Associated Press pictures of the two dining on typical Cuban creole 
favourites - fish, chicken, black beans and rice - accompanied by their 
mothers.

The privately run restaurant is famous as the filming location for the hit movie Strawberry and Chocolate, and is a mainstay on Havana's tourist circuit.

Waitress Silvia Fernandez said Beyonce toured the eatery and looked at photos of past celebrity clients: Jack Nicholson, Jodie Foster, Danny Glover, Will Smith, James Belushi and more.

Their bodyguards' presence outside set the gritty, bustling neighbourhood of Center Havana abuzz, and a crowd gathered downstairs shouting Beyonce's name until she went to a balcony and waved.

Police arrived and made sure she was able to exit without incident.

'She was beautiful, without a drop of makeup, very natural,' waitress Silvia Fernandez said. 'What happened with the people was incredible.'
