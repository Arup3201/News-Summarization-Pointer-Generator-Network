A man who used to weigh 35 stone is helping others get in shape after shedding 15 stone and qualifying as a fitness instructor. 

Marc Rodwell saw his weight soar through his teenage years as he gorged on junk food, takeaways and drank more than four litres of Irn Bru a day. 

His only form of exercise was a short walk with his dog in his garden.

Danger: Marc Rodwell saw his weight soar through his teenage years as he gorged on junk food, takeaways and drank more than four litres of Irn Bru a day

Change: His weight peaked at 35 stone before he lost 15 stone. He has now qualified as a fitness instructor to help other obese people get in shape

Mr
 Rodwell's weight steadily ballooned until July 2010 when his father, 
fearing for his son's health, bought him a set of digital scales.

But when Mr Rodwell stepped on, the screen simply read 'error' because he was too heavy.

He immediately joined the gym and began to drum everyday on Rock Band.

The 26-year-old from Hamilton, Lanarkshire, piled on the pounds until he took up going to the gym and started playing the PlayStation 3 game Rock Band.

Mr Rodwell played the interactive game's drum kit for hours every day 
and the energetic drumming burned so many calories that he has now lost 
15 stone.

Denial: Mr Rodwell's weight steadily ballooned until July 2010 when his father, fearing for his son's health, bought him a set of digital scales - which read an error message because he was so fat

He said: 'On Rock Band you really work up a sweat. I play all the instruments but
 I especially think the drums have helped with my weight loss.

'It
 sounds silly to say I play a game as an additional workout but you 
would be surprised how many calories you burn in two hours of drumming.

The
 exercise regime and a new healthy diet saw Mr Rodwell, who is 6ft tall,
 shed seven stone in six months and nine stone in the next year.

He said: 'I cut out all of the sweets, fizzy juice, desserts and started eating a better diet.

'I feel like a completely different person, I feel great.'

Surgery: Mr Rodwell, who is 6ft 6ins and now 20 stone, even underwent an operation to remove almost a stone of excess skin courtesy of the TV programme Embarrassing Bodies last year

Mr Rodwell, who is 6ft 6ins and now 20 stone, even underwent an operation to remove almost a stone of excess skin courtesy of the TV programme Embarrassing Bodies last year.

He has now qualified as a spin fit and indoor gym instructor to try and help others lose weight.

He said: 'I was very overweight and unhappy with myself for a long time.

'But as I started to eat properly and exercise, I lost weight and just felt great.

New start: He has now qualified as a spin fit and indoor gym instructor to try and help others lose weight

'I became addicted to the feeling of exercise and decided I wanted to help others achieve their goals.'

Mr
 Rodwell signed with training body Fitness Scotland and successfully 
gained certificates in Spin Fitness and Indoor Gym Instruction.

He added: 'I signed up and completed a few courses. They were great and taught me absolutely everything I needed to know.

'Now I have signed up my first clients and help train people two and three times a week. And ever since I lost that very first pound, I've never looked back.'

Mr Rodwell said: 'I know how it feels to walk into a gym and feel like the new kid. I understand how it feels to be embarrassed and bigger than you should be'

He added: 'I know how it feels to walk into a gym and feel like the new kid. I understand how it feels to be embarrassed and bigger than you should be.

'But that's part of the reason I wanted to help. I am living proof that exercise and eating a healthy diet works.

'I'm not a leaflet or a poster, I'm a person working alongside them saying, "I used to be nearly 40 stone".'
