The president and his supporters are pushing to get higher wages for American workers, but the nation's largest pro-Obama organizing group is telling its footsoldiers not to expect a paycheck at all.

Organizing For Action, which flexed its muscles as Obama For America during two presidential election campaigns, announced Wednesday that it's seeking 'Spring Organizing Fellows' to 'be a part of our growing organization' and 'explor[e] OFA's broad scope approach to issue advocacy.'

But unlike most fellowships, which offer a stipend or a housing allowance, the positions are strictly 'unpaid' and require Americans to work 'without the expectation of pay, for civic and public service purposes.'

Organizing For Action collected $7.7 million during the third quarter of 2013, according to disclosure reports collected by the Center for Responsive Politics. The group has raised nearly $21 million this year.

President Obama's election machine is now called 'Organizing For Action,' and it's looking for free labor while it pushes for a minimum wage hike

On Wednesday President Obama railed on against big-business efforts to block a minimum-wage hike, while his wealthy campaign machine pushed for free labor to do his bidding

An hour before OFA announced its 2014 fellowship program, the group tweeted a line from the president's Wednesday speech on the economy.

'Retweet if you agree: "It's well past the time to raise the minimum wage." —President Obama,' the group's message read.

Three hours later the Twitter account @BarackObama, which OFA controls, blasted out an infographic that claimed raising the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour would create 140,000 new jobs.

And the group's website advocates for policies that 'reward work by raising the minimum wage so an honest day’s work pays more.'

In a lengthy economic policy speech on Wednesday, the president complained that 'there are airport workers, and fast-food workers, and nurse assistants, and retail salespeople who work their tails off and are still living at or barely above poverty.'

'And that’s why it’s well past the time to raise a minimum wage that in real terms right now is below where it was when Harry Truman was in office.'

'Wage slaves'? Fast food workers are picketing McDonald's restaurants in New York City today, as part of the union-led social movement that Organization For Action supports

Thousands marched in front of Walmarts on Black Friday, demanding higher wages for employees. Unions paid some protesters to show up; Walmart hasn't budged on its wage policies or its decision to avoid unionizing its workforce

'For all their talk of fairness and justice, supporters of minimum wage hikes hypocritically fail to offer these exact same policies to their own employee interns,' Employment Policies Institute research director Michael Saltsman told MailOnline. 'It’s a classic case of "do what I say, not what I do."'

Organizing For Action did not respond to a request for comment.

The group has operated fellowship programs for several years, including the two presidential election cycles when it was the official Obama campaign organization.

But in those days, throngs of volunteers flocked to 'fellowship' meetings to learn how they could help elect, and then re-elect, Barack Obama.

In the president's second term, however, OFA has found it tougher to recruit cost-free labor.

Trouble in paradise, May 2013: An OFA organizer proudly tweeted a picture of just two 'fellows' building a climate-change database for OFA

'Look,' a Republican election consultant told MailOnline, 'Obamacare is in the trash heap, Iran is about to have a nuclear bomb, the IRS and Justice Department are as corrupt as a New Jersey mobster, and the White House has become a punchline.'

'No wonder the volunteers are staying home.'

Online photos from 2010 and earlier show hundreds of 'fellows' gathered in meeting rooms to receive their marching orders. More recent images circulating on Twitter and Facebook show tiny handfuls of volunteers engaged in defending the president and his policy objectives.

Anti-Obama partisans lashed out on Wednesday after OFA launched its search for unpaid workers.

'Do you provide a living wage to do this work?' one asked.

Another quipped: 'Only if you pay me $15 per hour, plus benefits. Otherwise you are exploiting my labor.'
