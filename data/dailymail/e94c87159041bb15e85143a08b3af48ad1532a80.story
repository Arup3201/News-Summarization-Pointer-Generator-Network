Britain is frittering away tens of millions of pounds hiring an army of consultants to tell India how to run its own affairs.

A Mail on Sunday investigation into contracts awarded to consultants has found that instead of money going directly to India’s poor and needy, much of it goes into the pockets of firms, some American, that are paid to hold meetings and produce reports.

It hired a group of consultants - including one leading US university - to work on a £5 million deal to tell the Department for International Development whether it was wasting money.

The UK Government insists it will continue to give the economic superpower £280 million a year until 2015 – despite India’s insistence that it does not want or need the money.

The rapidly industrialising country, whose economy is ranked 11th in the world with a GDP of £1.85 trillion, is rich enough to run its own space programme and last month announced it would spend £52 million sending a probe to Mars next year. David Cameron has courted controversy over the UK’s vast payments to India, designed, many believe, to detoxify the Tories’ image as the ‘nasty party’.

Just last month a powerful committee of peers urged the Prime Minister to abandon his policy on aid to the country, saying Ministers should ‘urgently prepare an exit strategy from Britain’s £1.1 billion aid to India’.

The peers pointed out that sending millions of pounds to a country that  can afford its own space programme provided a ‘perverse incentive’ for the Indian government to shirk its own responsibility for tackling poverty.

But The Mail on Sunday has discovered that since the Government announced an overhaul of Indian aid spending in 2010 in response to criticism, it has:

The Department for International Development (DfID) has a staff of 90 and uses outside contractors for much of its work. The department also outsources its recruitment to private firms in India.

The practice has raised questions about what its own staff are doing.

In the past year, the UK donated £292.5 million to India, with £268.4 million from DfID’s budget, despite comments from Indian finance minister Pranab Mukherjee that India did not need British aid, which he described as ‘a peanut in our total development exercises’.

Last night, Tory backbencher Philip Davies said: ‘To spend any money at all on aid to India is unjustifiable, but for the money from the aid budget to be spent on US academics and Western consultants is both beyond belief and beneath contempt.

‘Clearly, DflD have so much money they don’t know what to do with it and it’s about time George Osborne cut the budget down to a much more affordable figure where the money could be spent on alleviating real poverty.’

Chancellor George Osborne is coming under pressure to reduce the amount of money awarded to the Department for International Development (DfID)

Julian Morris, vice-president of research at the Reason Foundation think-tank and author of a recent report on foreign aid for the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘When Britain’s national debt is growing, it is highly irresponsible to continue to fritter away our children’s future on pointless and even counterproductive foreign “aid”.

‘There is a major problem, because those consultants are powerful and vocal vested interests.

‘Some of them, as this investigation documents, even masquerade as charities and religious organisations.’

India also runs its own overseas aid programme, which is worth about £2 billion a year.

Former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell – who was replaced last week by Justine Greening – repeatedly insisted that Britain’s aid commitment to India runs until only 2015.

But last April DfID awarded a £7,506,606 contract to the Asian Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex for ‘research consultancy services’ as part of a six-year programme in South Asia.

Last night the DfID said: ‘The new Secretary of State for International Development is looking carefully at DfID activity in India. As we have always made clear, DfID will not be in India for ever. We are currently discussing the future of our programme with the government of India.’
