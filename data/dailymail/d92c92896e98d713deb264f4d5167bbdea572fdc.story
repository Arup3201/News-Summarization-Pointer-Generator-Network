A member of Jodi Arias' legal team has been banned from visiting her in jail after she was caught bringing a piece of the convicted murderer's art out of the Arizona facility.

Maria De La Rosa, a mitigation specialist who is trying to build a case that will humanize Arias and help convince a jury not to sentence her to death, was found carrying one of Arias' drawings out of the Maricopa County jail in late February.

De La Rosa and the rest of Arias' legal team argued that the artwork is part of her defense case, and they planned to display it to the jury when her sentencing trial begins on September 8.

Ban: Maria De La Rosa, seen right next to Jodi Arias after her guilty verdict was handed down in May, was found bringing one of Arias' drawings out of prison and is no longer allowed to visit as a result

The sheriff's office was concerned that she was carrying the drawing- which showed a multi-color drawing of a pinwheel- on behalf of Arias in order to deliver it to someone on the outside.

'The only material provided to Maria was legal material, and I find what the jail is doing is outrageous,' Ms De La Rosa's attorney Dan Raynak told The Arizona Republic.

'I personally find it outrageous, because Maria is beyond reproach and is one of the finest mitigation specialists I've worked with.'

One of Arias' lawyers from her murder trial confirmed that they regularly brought her artwork out of prison because they presented some of it during the five-month trial that started on January 2, 2013 and ended on May 8 after the jury reached a guilty verdict following 15 hours of deliberation.

Color work: Jodi Arias has been producing drawings while in prison as she waits to have a new jury determine whether she will face the death penalty or life in jail

Arias, who murdered her boyfriend Travis Alexander, is in jail awaiting a second round in court where a new jury will determine whether or not she should be sentenced to the death penalty or life in prison.

The sentencing trial is set for September 8 after rounds of delays.

Arias, a photographer by trade, has been working actively on her drawing skills andÂ  used it as a form of income during her trial by selling off works that she made from behind bars.

Supporters have maintained a website where her work is available for sale.

Waiting for the next step: Arias' lawyers also put in a motion to have the possibility of the death penalty taken out of the jury's range of options but no verdict has been handed down on that

Her rates have gone down dramatically since her guilty verdict was handed down in May, however.

Her drawings were being sold for thousands at the peak of the trial- like one of Grace Kelly that went for $3,050- as opposed to the two drawings currently available on the site.

Both pieces- one of a sailboat at sunset and another of a vase of calla lillies- are on sale for $39.

The Arizona Republic reports that Arias' legal team submitted multiple motions to Judge Sherry Stephens on Monday including one to allow Ms De La Rosa to be able to visit the county jails both for Arias and her other death row clients.

Another motion pushed for the death penalty to be removed from the list of options that will be presented to the new jury.
