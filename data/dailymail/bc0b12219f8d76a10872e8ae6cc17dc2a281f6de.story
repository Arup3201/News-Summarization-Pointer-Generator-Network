Tragic: Leila Fowler was found stabbed to death in her own home in Valley Springs, California, on Saturday afternoon

Investigators searching for answers in the stabbing death of an eight-year-old California girl have interviewed registered sex offenders in her community, raiding the homes of some.

Leila Fowler was found dead in her Valley Springs residence over the weekend, sparking an intense manhunt for her killer.

Police haven't named any suspects in the case but Calaveras County Sheriff's Capt. Jim Macedo said late yesterday that they have turned their attention to sex offenders, though officials won't say whether the young victim was sexually assaulted before her death.

'They have been interviewed and in some cases they have been photographed and in some cases they have been searched,' Capt. Jim Macedo told CNN.

Police have beefed-up security at schools in Valley Springs since Leila's 12-year-old brother saw an intruder in their home on Saturday then discovered his sister suffering stab wounds.

He described the suspect as a white or Hispanic male with a muscular build, about 6 feet tall, wearing a black long-sleeved shirt and blue pants. He is also believed to have long gray hair.

According to police, the boy 
encountered the intruder who immediately fled leaving the bloody 
evidence of his crime for the terrified child to find. He called 911 and Leila was pronounced just six minutes after she arrived at hospital.

Residents in Calveras County have been ordered to lock their doors as deputies searched for the killer. A neighbor said he spotted the suspect fleeing shortly after the 911 call.

Police officers from neighboring 
areas have been called in to help as authorities hunt down the suspect. 
They have been running down leads, searching in attics, storage sheds in
the mountainous, rural community.

With
the suspect still on the loose, some of the kids in this enclave 
nestled in the Sierra Nevada foothills were hunkering down after school 
at James Barci's ranch.

'Nobody
is staying alone,' said Barci, a truck driver and parent volunteer at 
Jenny Lind Elementary School, where Leila was a popular third-grader.

'I told my work I'm not coming in, and I'm just going to have all of my kids' friends at the house until this is over.'

The
apparently random attack has the tight-knit community on edge. Parents 
such as Barci spontaneously showed up Monday at the school of 500 
students to give hugs or tie purple and pink ribbons - Leila's favorite 
colors - to trees on campus.

Later Monday, authorities identified the girl's parents while also saying a witness saw a person running from the family home that had a similar description of a man who fled from the home when the girl's brother confronted him.

In a hastily called news conference, Capt. Jim Macedo identified the father of Leila Fowler as Barney Fowler and the mother as Krystal Walters. The names of the parents hadn't previously been released.

As Macedo spoke, Fowler and Walters - both solemn and declining to speak, and with Walters near tears at times - stood in the background.

Macedo said Leila's parents wanted to convey their requests that their privacy be respected, but also that a memorial fund had been set up for their daughter. A vigil is also planned for tonight.

No suspects have been named, but officials said a second witness saw someone with a description similar to one provided by Leila's brother of a man who ran from the home when the boy confronted him.

As well as sex offenders, investigators are checking registered parolees in the area.

Horrifying: Leila Fowler's 12-year-old brother was at their home with her in Valley Springs around noon on Saturday when he encountered the intruder, who immediately fled

In a pastoral place where fat horses 
swish their tails in knee-high grass and few people had ever bothered to
lock their doors, residents now say their guns are loaded.

'My
husband wanted me to put one in my car so I'd have it in my hand when I
entered the house,' Tabatha Camden said as she dropped off a neighbor's
children at the school.

'I drew the line at that. We've always had one gun loaded in the house at all times, but now we have four.'

The
sheriff's office has released little information about the killing 
other than a vague description of a man with long gray hair.

Calaveras County Deputy Coroner Steve Moore said the girl died from multiple stab wounds. They have not revealed how many times she was stabbed or where.

The
Fowler family's hillside street is blocked off as a crime scene, since 
nobody knows for sure how the intruder arrived or where he went.

Violent
crime is so rare in the community of 7,400 people that even law 
enforcement officers have to stop and think when asked about the last 
time there was a stranger killing in the area.

'Probably
five years ago was the last one I can remember,' said Officer Rebecca 
Myers of the California Highway Patrol, who was assigned to block access
to the neighborhood of one-acre ranchettes.

The killing of the little girl known for her sweet smile, generous hugs and friendly demeanor has hit the community hard.

It's
a place where parents read about tragedies in other places and give 
thanks that they live in Calaveras County, which makes the news only 
when the jumping frog contest celebrated by Mark Twain is taking place 
at the county fair.

'I 
don't know how our children are going to adjust to this,' said Kathryn 
Danielli, who moved here from Stockton with her sixth-grade daughter to 
escape crime.

Danielli was 
among about 20 parents who drove their children to school then stayed to
lend support. Sheriff's deputies patrolled the area and sheriff's 
volunteers stood guard at the entrance.

'Everybody
up here who has kids moved up here because your kids can go outside and
play,' said Kim Hoeke, who moved from Antioch in the San Francisco Bay 
area seven years ago.

Calaveras
Unified School District Superintendent Mark Campbell said at least two 
therapy dogs and 10 counselors were on hand for students, teachers and 
staff to guide them through the grieving process.

Leila would have turned nine-years-old in June

Campbell
said he met with Leila's parents on Monday when they came to the school to
thank teachers and staff for the support they had offered.

The
parents were at a Little League game at the time their daughter was 
attacked, Campbell said.

Part
of the school-guided grieving process included classrooms taking turns 
writing notes to Leila and hanging them on the fence at the entrance to 
the school. They came in somber groups and attached their notes one by 
one.

'Dear Leila: You were a fun person and very smart. I enjoyed being around you every minute,' one girl wrote.

'I know you are in heaven looking down at us but you will always be in my heart,' wrote another.

Campbell said officers will have a presence at the school at until the case is resolved.

The
suspect is the subject of a broad manhunt by the sheriff's departments 
of Calaveras and surrounding counties, the California Highway Patrol and
the state Department of Justice.

Sheriff's officials say investigators collected fingerprints and what they believe is DNA from the home on Sunday.

'Our
normal has changed and we will move forth and heal by coming together, 
as we all are here today,' said Linda Stoes, whose daughter dressed in 
purple Monday to honor her friend. 'Our perspectives have changed 
forever.'

While
door-to door searches are proving fruitless, the residents are still 
reeling shock that in such a quiet, rural area, such a thing could 
happen.

'This is way 
too close to home,' Julia Poland, who took her 13-year-old daughter to 
an afternoon news conference on the search, told the Modesto Bee. 'This 
kind of thing does not happen here.'

Manhunt: California police officers are searching for the man suspected of murdering a 9-year-old girl

Witness: The girl's 12-year-old brother was at their home with her in Valley Springs around noon on Saturday when he encountered the intruder, who immediately fled

A neighbor, Roger Ballew told the Associated Press: 'I was working on my
tractor and a CHP copter kept flying over my house.' After a SWAT team 
showed up at his house Saturday night and told him to stay inside, he 
admitted: 'It was nerve-wracking, I didn't sleep well.'

Immediately after the 911 call was 
reported, a quarter-mile perimeter was set up around the house as police
conduct the house-to-house search.

'We were doing a house-to-house search 
and in some cases we're searching extensively into attics and storage 
sheds,' Capt. Macedo told CBS Sacramento earlier. He added: 'It’s a 
difficult area to search. It’s rural, it’s remote.'

Macedo said the girl was suffering from severe injuries and her death has been ruled a homicide. He urged residents to keep their doors locked until they find the suspect.

Leila would have turned nine-years-old in June.

Campbell said in a statement on Sunday 
that there will be an added law enforcement presence at Jenny Lind 
Elementary and bus stops nearby.

Valley
Springs is a community of about 2,500 people in an unincorporated area 
of Calaveras County, known as 'Gold Country,' in the foothills of the 
Sierra Nevada mountains, about 60 miles southeast of Sacramento.
