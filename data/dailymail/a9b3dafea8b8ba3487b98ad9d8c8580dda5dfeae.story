Hyde Park IRA bomb survivor Michael Pedersen killed himself and his two young children days after his wife asked for a divorce, it emerged yesterday.

Friends of the couple said he had become a ‘bully’ and ‘wife abuser’ in the months leading up to the tragic events on Sunday.

The bodies of Mr Pedersen and his seven-year-old Ben and Freya, six, were discovered on a bridle path in Hampshire. He had stabbed himself in the chest after using the knife on his children.

It emerged yesterday that Erica, his wife of 10 years and mother of the two children, had recently asked the 51-year-old former soldier for a divorce.

The father-of-four, who had stabbed himself repeatedly in the chest after using the same knife on his children, had been kicked out of the family’s £310,000 terraced home in Ashford just three weeks ago.

Neighbours said the couple, who had celebrated their 10th anniversary in July, had had problems after Mrs Pedersen got drunk at a party and kissed another man in front of her husband.

They claimed police had been called to the family home a number of times over arguments between the couple.

A woman, who described herself as Erica’s best friend said that the 43-year-old driving instructor had already started divorce proceedings against Mr Pedersen who she claimed had been using the children against his wife.

Speaking after visiting the devastated mother at her red-brick home yesterday with flowers, the 45-year-old friend said: ‘He was controlling, a bully and a wife abuser.

‘His final control over Erica was the children; it was his last throw of the dice. No one expected this - he was meant to have loved those kids.’

Another friend, who declined to be named, said: ‘He (Michael) has been made out to be a hero, but he was not. He was a bully and a coward.

‘Erica was a wonderful Mum and those kids were just gorgeous, nobody can believe that this has happened.’

In 1982, Pedersen was riding the famous cavalry horse Sefton to the Changing of the Guard ceremony in Hyde Park when an IRA nail bomb exploded killing four soldiers and seven horses from the Household Cavalry.

Sefton was severely injured and suffered 37 shrapnel wounds in the blast but the horse’s remarkable recovery led to him becoming a household name.

An ex-military colleague of Mr Pedersen last night dismissed claims that the bombing still haunted the former soldier.

He claimed that Mr Pedersen had instead enjoyed the 'notoriety' of having ridden the iconic horse during the bombing.

The former Household Cavalryman, who
declined to be named, said: ‘When I saw him at functions he always 
seemed just a perfectly normal happy guy.

‘We would laugh, have a lot to drink and reminisce about the old days. I don’t think he was affected at all by the bombings.

‘I actually think that he quite liked the notoriety and enjoyed the fame that it brought him.’

In the weeks leading up to his death, Mr Pedersen spoke about his marriage breaking up on Facebook.

On August 31 he said: ‘Worst day of my life. Sadly have split with Erica am absolutely distraught.’

Surrey Police confirmed that officers had had contact with the family prior to the tragedy. The case was referred to the IPCC.
