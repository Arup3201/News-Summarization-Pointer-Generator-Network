Roy Carroll completed his second game in 24 hours on Saturday after starting Northern Ireland's 2-0 defeat against Romania on Friday before turning out to keep of clean sheet for Notts Country just hours later.

The 37-year-old goalkeeper showed his dedication to the League One club's promotion push by travelling in the small hours of Saturday morning in order to make Shaun Derry's starting line-up at the Ricoh Arena.

Unfortunately for Carroll, Northern Ireland's three-game Euro 2016 qualifier unbeaten run was ended with a cruel defeat which saw Romania's Paul Papp net twice in five minutes to condemn Michael O'Neill's side to drop their first points in Group F.

Carroll, who was even given the man of the match award by the Northern Irish faithful, will have had to travel close to 1,700 miles to get back to the UK and reportedly caught a 5am plane, for a journey which will have taken around five hours to ensure he could turn out for his club side.

The goalkeeper's overnight endeavors paid off as the former Manchester United stopper saw little action during the 3pm kick-off which ended in a 1-0 victory thanks to Curtis Thompson strike in the 72nd minute.
