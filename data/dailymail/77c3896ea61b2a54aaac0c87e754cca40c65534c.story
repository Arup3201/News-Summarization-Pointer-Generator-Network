BIG BOOTS TO FILL

Brazil will never be able to replace Neymar, but Oscar and Willian can give it a good go. Jose Mourinho has championed Oscar in that role behind the striker, so much so that he sold Juan Mata to play him there. Neymar has thrived in that position but Oscar can, too.

He is a complete footballer and is tenacious with and without the ball. If he plays through the middle expect him to be buzzing all over Bastian Schweinsteiger.

His Chelsea team-mate Willian could also be involved and whether he plays out wide or through the middle, he will add some serious mileage to this team because he is a real worker.

HEARTS v HEADS

I've been in the stadium for Brazil’s last two games and the atmosphere is unbelievable. It just does not stop. As a player it is difficult to raise your head up and out of that and to stay calm, but that is what Brazil must do.

Whenever the hosts score the overwhelming sensation is relief, but then they can go into panic mode and lose their heads. That’s why they’ve been scraping through games.

They could have done with somebody like Kaka, who has won the World Cup, in the squad to help settle them. The Germans have not been brilliant, but they are an excellent tournament team and are well organised.

If Brazil play with too much emotion, Germany could calmly exploit it.

BACK TO BASICS

Against Algeria in the last 16, Germany looked strangely vulnerable, despite having 23 shots at goal. They did not control the game as you would expect but against France they were much more solid.

Philipp Lahm was moved back to where he belongs — at full back — and Jerome Boateng replaced Per Mertesacker in the centre to give their backline much more pace. 

That allowed Schweinsteiger to really dominate the midfield from deep, with Sami Khedira dropping in when needed.

It was as well as they had played since the opening win against Portugal, so don’t be surprised if they line up that way again.

Change: Phillip Lahm has reverted to full back, allowing Bastian Schweinsteiger to control the midfield

FLYING FULL BACKS

I don't know why Luiz Felipe Scolari played Maicon against Colombia instead of Dani Alves. In Alves and Marcelo, Brazil have two of the best attacking full backs in the world. 

Yes, they can leave gaps behind them but Scolari should be saying to Germany: ‘We are Brazil and we’re going to attack you. Can you deal with us going forward?’ Marcelo has so often provided an outlet for Brazil but he does need to concentrate. 

I don’t imagine Thomas Muller will start on the wing but the German forward will angle his runs — moving inside then out wide — to get in the space behind Marcelo.
