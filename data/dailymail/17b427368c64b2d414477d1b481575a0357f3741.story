He might be in trouble with the Palace over nude photographs taken in Las Vegas, but at least he's got a few thousand (naked) shoulders to cry on.

Prince Harry's naked army is made up of nearly 33,000 British soldiers and members of the public who have shed their clothes and given him a salute, in a show of support for the boisterous third in line to the throne.

Spanning the scorching frontline in Afghanistan to rain-swept barracks in the UK, troops and supporters of the Armed Forces have united in their birthday suits to follow his lead – and then posted the results on the internet, infuriating the top brass.

Patriotic women of all shapes and sizes come together to salute Prince Harry in the middle of a road

What a view! This group of injured soldiers and their instructors brave the cold to beam into the camera

You could park a bicycle in there! This man puts safety first by donning a safety gear before saluting the prince

But despite their anger, many have 
still taken to stripping off to show the young Royal that they don't 
mind his outrageous antics while he partied in America.

Nearly 33,000 people had joined the 
Facebook group ‘Support 
Prince Harry With A Naked Salute!’ and many of the servicemen and women 
posed completely naked, using their hands or strategically placed guns, 
caps 
or rucksacks to protect their modesty.

And ordinary civilians have 
imaginatively employed guitars, straw hats and even cereal boxes to mask
 their modesty as they beam into the camera.

In recently added photos to the website, a group of injured soldiers beam with their instructors as they all keep their private parts out of view.

Gone global: Supporters of the Prince and his impromptu game of strip pool has garnered support from around the world - including from this proud American, left, and a very smiley man who appeared to shed his SpongeBob SquarePants boxer shorts in favour of just a straw hat for the photo

In another, one man risks an unpleasant 
injury by clambering on to a bicycle before giving a cheeky wave outside
 his garden shed.

One man improvises with a straw hat to keep his private parts out of sight, while another uses an American flag in his his cheeky photo.

The popularity of the group has exploded, as many believe the young Royal should not be severely reprimanded for his fun with friends.

In one photograph, men from D Squadron
 The King’s Royal Hussars posed nude in front of two Mastiff armoured 
patrol vehicles in Helmand. In another, a naked soldier salutes in front
 of an Army vehicle with only a plastic bottle to preserve his modesty.

Despite protests that the troops are 
merely joking around to ease the stress of battle, senior officers are 
understood to be unimpressed with the near-the-knuckle pranks which began last week.

It has become so popular that military
 personnel from around the world, including Israel and the US, have 
posted photos of themselves in the nude.

The page was set up by ex-soldier 
Jordan Wylie, 28, from Blackpool and his friend Lee Kirkton, after grainy pictures emerged of a 
naked Prince Harry – along with two nude girls –  taken during a game of
 strip billiards in his £5,100-a-night suite at the Encore Wynn Hotel in
 Vegas.

Mr Wylie said: ‘It was outrageous [that] Harry was criticised for his antics in Las Vegas because he is just one of the lads.

‘He might be a royal but he is also a 
hard-working Apache helicopter pilot and he wants to have some fun. I’m 
sure Harry will be quietly smiling about the Facebook group.’ He may, 
however, be less amused by claims yesterday that a video of the romp 
exists.

Mr Wylie and Mr Kirkton are now using the widespread popularity of the group to fund a good cause - Walking With The Wounded.

On their website www.Salute4Harry.com, they chose the Walking With The Wounded charity which supports injured servicemen and women who have sustained horrific injuries as direct result of serving their country in times of war.

Many of the injured personnel face a long road to recovery and many will never fully recover in their lifetime

The website says these people face challenges that many can never imagine enduring and the cause aims empower them by retraining them and providing them with new skills so they can find new careers outside the military.

Walking With The Wounded supports injured servicemen and women who have sustained horrific injuries as direct result of serving their country in times of war. Many of the injured personnel face a long road to recover and many will never fully recover in their lifetime, these people often face challenges that they could never have imagined. This charity focusses on giving injured servicemen and women inspiration by supporting them to achieve extraordinary things

The 27-year-old royal, a captain in 
the Army Air Corps, is expected to be reprimanded for his behaviour when
 he returns from leave in a few weeks’ time.

As for his brothers (and sisters) in 
arms, a source close to the Army said it would be up to the commanding 
officers of individual soldiers in the photographs to decide if 
disciplinary action would be taken.

Peace offering: These girls are willing to show their loyalty to the third in line to the throne

‘Everyone sees the funny side but 
there are people at senior levels in the Army who do not consider this 
to be appropriate. They will be thinking, “Does this really show us in 
the professional light we want to be seen [in]?”

‘It’s unlikely anyone will get the book thrown at them.’

The press watchdog has received 
3,600 complaints after the Sun became the first British newspaper to 
print the naked photographs of Prince Harry.

All came from members of the public. None came from St James’s Palace or any other representatives of the Royal Family.

The Facebook page that has been set up in support of Harry has more than 15,000 members
