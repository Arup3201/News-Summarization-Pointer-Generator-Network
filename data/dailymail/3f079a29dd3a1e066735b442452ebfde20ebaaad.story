Under pressure: David Cameron is cutting his trade trip to South Africa short because of the phone hacking crisis

David Cameron will tonight fly into the greatest crisis of his premiership as the phone hacking affair forces him to cut short a trip to Africa.

The Prime Minister insisted there was no comparison between his hiring of ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his media chief and Met Police boss Sir Paul Stephenson’s employment of his deputy, Neil Wallis.

But Sir Paul’s resignation on Sunday night – with a bitter parting shot at the Prime Minister over Mr Coulson – sent shockwaves through the Government.

London Mayor Boris Johnson – seen as a
potential rival for the Prime Minister’s job – infuriated Downing 
Street by refusing to say whether or not Mr Cameron should consider 
resigning too.

And in a 
sign of jitters on Mr Cameron’s own benches, Conservative MP John Baron 
said hiring Mr Coulson might have been ‘an own goal’.

Deputy
Prime Minister Nick Clegg had to take to the airwaves to insist: ‘I 
don’t think that this is about the Prime Minister’s position, absolutely
not. Let’s keep this in perspective.’

The
Prime Minister has shortened the length of what was supposed to be a 
five-day trip to Africa for the second time and will now return to 
Britain tonight.

Some Tory MPs warned privately that 
Mr Cameron’s absence looked like he was failing to get a grip on the 
crisis – or worse. One said: It looks like the PM is fleeing the 
country.’

The Prime Minister has also agreed 
that Parliament, which had been due to rise for its summer break 
tonight, should sit tomorrow.

Mr Cameron will make a statement on 
the latest developments in the scandal and give MPs details of the 
judge-led inquiry into press standards, phone hacking and police 
corruption.

Yesterday he attempted to shift 
attention back on to the police by warning there were now some ‘very big
questions about potential police corruption’.

In an event at the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange in South Africa, he sidestepped a question about whether he 
had considered his own position in recent days, saying: ‘The British 
government, in terms of the phone hacking scandal, has taken all of the 
appropriate actions.

‘We 
have set up a judicial inquiry, we have made sure there is a properly 
funded police investigation, we have published huge amounts of 
information about any meetings between politicians and senior media 
executives.

Ed Miliband was accused of using Milly Dowler’s family as a political football yesterday as he attacked David Cameron over the phone hacking scandal.

Listeners criticised the Labour leader after he repeatedly made reference to the murdered schoolgirl in a speech broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live.

One sent a message saying: ‘I find the politicisation of the Dowler family sickening. They have suffered enough and don’t need to be used as a political football in this shameless way.’

After reading out a series of similar messages, presenter Eleanor Oldroyd said: ‘Pretty much all the texts we’ve had are in this vein.’

‘I feel I have been out there in 
Parliament, in press conferences fully answering the questions, fully 
transparent, very clear about what needs to be done – making sure that 
Britain gets to the bottom of what has been a terrible episode in terms 
of what newspapers have done, and also some very big questions about 
potential police corruption. We need to get to the bottom of those.’

Mr Cameron insisted the cases of Mr 
Coulson and Mr Wallis, the former deputy editor of the News of the 
World, were ‘really quite different’.

Mr Coulson quit the newspaper in 2007 
after one of its reporters was jailed for phone hacking. He insists he 
had no knowledge of the practice. He resigned as Mr Cameron’s media 
chief in January because of continuing media coverage, and was arrested 
earlier this month over alleged hacking.

A poll today suggests the public is 
largely unmoved by the scandal. The ICM survey for The Guardian shows 
the Conservatives moving into a narrow lead over Labour.

It
puts the Conservatives on 37 per cent, unchanged in a month, Labour 
down three points on 36 per cent and the Lib Dems up four on 16 per 
cent, their highest rating since March.

Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday 
came close to suggesting the Prime Minister should consider his 
position, saying he must ‘face up’ to the consequences of his decision 
to hire Mr Coulson.

‘Sir 
Paul Stephenson has taken responsibility and resigned over the hiring of
Mr Coulson’s deputy while the prime minister has not even apologised 
for the hiring of Mr Coulson,’ Mr Miliband said.

Labour also highlighted Sir Paul’s claim
that he had not told the Prime Minister about his employment of Mr 
Wallis because he might somehow be ‘compromised’ because of his 
association with Mr Coulson.

In the Commons, Home Secretary Theresa May accused Labour of desperate ‘opportunism’.

She said: ‘Of course there is difference between the Met and the Government. The Metropolitan Police were investigating allegations of wrongdoing at the News of the World. It is absolutely right there should be a line between the investigators and the investigated.’

But veteran Labour backbencher Sir Gerald Kaufman called on Mr Cameron to ‘consider his position’.

And Labour left-winger Dennis Skinner demanded Mr Cameron’s resignation.  Mr Johnson gave Mr Cameron only lukewarm support at a press conference following the resignation of the Met assistant commissioner John Yates.

He said: ‘I’m not here to discuss government appointments, I’m here to talk about events in the Metropolitan police service. Those questions you must direct to government.’

The Prime Minister is also under pressure to say whether he sought Civil Service advice before meeting James Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks at Christmas in the middle of the now-abandoned News Corporation bid for BSkyB.

Last night Downing Street disclosed a further meeting between Mrs Brooks and Mr Cameron at his birthday party. The encounter had been omitted from what was intended to be a complete list of Mr Cameron’s meetings with senior newspaper executives.
