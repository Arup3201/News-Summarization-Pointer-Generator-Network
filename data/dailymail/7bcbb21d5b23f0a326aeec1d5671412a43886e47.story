Unhealthy modern lifestyles aren’t the only cause of heart disease, say scientists, who have found clogged arteries in Egyptian mummies.

Scans of 4,000-year-old mummies have revealed evidence of hardening of the arteries – a condition which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.

Earlier studies had revealed fatty arteries in a large number of Egyptian mummies but critics had dismissed the find as related to their luxurious, fatty diets.

Scans of 4,000-year-old mummies have revealed evidence of hardening of the arteries - a condition which can lead to heart attacks and strokes

Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of heart attacks and strokes caused by lack of blood to the brain.

Until now it had been widely assumed that today's high rates of heart and artery disease were chiefly the result of unhealthy modern lifestyles.

It is though that diets rich in saturated fat encourage the deposit of fatty layers on artery walls which harden over time.

As a result blood vessels become narrower and the flow of blood is impeded. When insufficient blood reaches the heart muscle or brain it can trigger a heart attack or stroke.

‘Atherosclerosis is supposed to be a disease of modern civilisation,’ Dr Adel Allam, a nuclear cardiologist at Cairo’s Al Azhar University told Alan Mozes of Health Day.

‘It's supposed to be explained by the fact that we're eating all the wrong foods, not exercising enough, becoming obese and having diabetes.

‘And a lot of people have said that if we could just go back to the way our ancestors were living we could even lose this problem,’ he added.

In a previous study, scientists looked for evidence of heart disease by taking an X-ray of the mummified remains of Esankh who lived in the third Intermediate period (1070-712 BC)

An Egyptian princess who lived more than 3,500 years ago is the oldest known person to have had clogged arteries, dispelling the myth that heart disease is a product of modern society.

Dr Allam and colleagues made the discovery in 2011 when they found the Egyptian princess Ahmose-Meryet-Amon, who lived in Thebes  between 1540 and 1550 B.C., had calcium deposits in two main coronary arteries.

The princess' father and brother were both pharaohs. The mummy had pierced ears and a large incision in her left side made by embalmers to remove her internal organs.

Dr Allam doubted she would have received much treatment beyond maybe taking special herbs or honey.

'If she were my patient today, she would get open heart surgery,' he said. He added the princess' clogged arteries looked remarkably similar to heart disease in contemporary Egyptians.

Dr Allam and his colleagues presented their findings at the recently concluded American College of Cardiology annual meeting, in Washington.

The group had previously found identified hardening of the arteries in 16 mummies at the Egyptian National Museum of Antiquities in Cairo.

Of these, nine showed evidence of atherosclerosis - build-up of fatty materials such as cholesterol, in blood vessels.

But the group decided to expand their initial study to include naturally mummified specimens from other societies and economic backgrounds.

Samples were gathered from Lima, Peru; from the Aleutian people in Alaska; from Native Americans in Nevada; and from people in Mongolia.

Dr Allam said he wanted to respond to any criticism that mummies of Egypt only represented a rich elite, who would have eaten more fatty foods.

The scientists scanned 76 mummies from around the world and arterial disease was found in around 38 per cent of them, with the average age of death estimated at 37.

The team also scanned 178 Cairo cancer patients, aged from 14 to 48, and found that 61 per cent of them had arterial hardening.

‘There was no difference between the mummies and patients in terms of atherosclerosis incidence or severity,’ Dr Allam said. ‘They were nearly equivalent’.

Dr Allam added that heart disease risk is not just about poor diet and obesity, but that genetics may also come into play.

A second CT reconstruction from an earlier study shows a mummy from 200-900 AD of a Peruvian woman in her 40s, excavated from Huallamarca, near Lima, with calcifications in the arteries

Last year, CT scans of 137 mummies showed evidence of atherosclerosis, or hardened arteries, in one third of those examined - including those from ancient people believed to have healthy lifestyles.

'Heart disease has been stalking mankind for over 4,000 years all over the globe,' said Dr Randall Thompson, a cardiologist at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City and the 2013 paper's lead author.

Dr Thompson said he was surprised to see hardened arteries even in people like the ancient Aleutians who were presumed to have a healthy lifestyle as hunter-gatherers.

'I think it's fair to say people should feel less guilty about getting heart disease in modern times,' he said. 'We may have oversold the idea that a healthy lifestyle can completely eliminate your risk.
