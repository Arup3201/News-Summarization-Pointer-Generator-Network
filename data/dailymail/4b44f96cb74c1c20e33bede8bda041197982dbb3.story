The sinking of the Costa Concordia in January last year is one of the worst maritime disasters in living memory, with 32 passengers tragically losing their lives.

Now new insight into the frantic moments before the cruise liner hit rocks just off the island of Giglio in Italy have been revealed.

The captain of the Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, is said to have cried out 'Madonna, what have I done?', as the cruise liner hurtled into rocks off the coast of Tuscany, an Italian has court heard.

Captain Francesco Schettino, who was in command of the ship on the night of the disaster, reacted with disbelief on the impact, asking fellow officers ‘Did we hit a reef?', according to a recording played in court in Grosseto, Tuscany.

Schettino, 52, is facing 20 years jail time if convicted of dereliction of duty and multiple counts of manslaughter. 

His lawyers argue that he is not solely responsible for the tragedy.

The giant cruise liner Concordia hit rocks on the night of January 13, 2012 and 32 people were killed when it sank.

Salvatore Ursino, left, arrived yesterday with his lawyer Antonio Langher at court where he gave evidence that Captain Schettino ordered officers to make the boat go faster in the run-up to the disaster

It is believed Schettino had diverted the ship in an attempt to make an ill-judged 'salute' to the island of Giglio.

Giving evidence for the prosecution, Salvatore Ursino, one of the ship’s junior officers, alleged that the Captain had been too slow to take action when things began to unravel and, in the run-up to the impact, ordered officers to make the boat go faster.

Mr Ursino said that 'just five minutes before' Schettino had given the command to take the boat from 15 knots to 16 knots.

‘Schettino gave the order to increase the speed to his deputy, (first officer) Ciro Ambrosio,’ Mr Ursino told the court.

Their problems began when the Indonesian helmsman failed to understand the Captain's orders twice as they approached the rocks, Mr Ursino said.

Schettino allegedly still took no action, merely repeating his commands in English with the added threat, 'or else we'll hit the rocks'.

Salvage operators in Italy lifted the Costa Concordia cruise ship upright from its watery grave off the island of Giglio in September, in the biggest ever project of its kind

Ursino and another female official were forced to approach the helmsman themselves to try to steer the ship out of danger.

In the course of his evidence, Mr Ursino, who was the only officer at Schettino's side continuously during the incident, also described the presence of other guests on the bridge.

One of these was Antonello Tievoli, the ship’s maitre d who was originally from the island of Giglio.

Schettino allegedly sailed the ship close to the island in a 'salute' in order to impress him.

Another was Moldovan dancer Domnica Cemortan, who was accused of causing the accident by flirting with Schettino.

She has always denied an affair with the Captain even though her suitcase and bikini was found in Schettino's cabin.

Miss Cemortan, now a civil plaintiff in the trial, was in court and is due to give evidence for the prosecution tomorrow.

The 950 tonne ship was wrenched off the rocks last month in a mammoth operation and is expected to be removed from the island after the winter.
