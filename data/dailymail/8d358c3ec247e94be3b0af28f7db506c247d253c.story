His alarm goes off at 3.30am, then it’s just a matter of the 181-mile drive to work.

Gary Egan is at his desk by 6.30am each morning, works up to 12 hours a day – then faces the three-hour evening trek home in his Renault Clio.

His commute, one of the longest in Britain, sees him travel nearly 100,000 miles a year, equivalent to going four times around the Earth.

Gary Egan clocks up 100,000 miles a year with a daily six hour round-trip from his home in Porthcawl, South Wales, to his workplace in Watford, Hertfordshire

The round trip between home in Porthcawl, South Wales, and his office in Watford costs about £15,000 a year.

This includes £900 a month on diesel and £6.40 a day in toll fees to cross the Severn Bridge.

The father of two admits the journey, which he does five days a week as head of production for a graphics company, is gruelling.

But
 Mr Egan insists it is worth it because he and his partner Sarah can 
enjoy a better quality of life in Porthcawl than if they lived nearer to
 Watford.

Mr Egan has to set his alarm for 3.30am every day before setting off on the six hour round trip in his Renault Clio

Mr Egan clocks up more than 100,000 miles a year with this 366 mile round-trip to and from work

Yesterday the 
46-year-old, who would only give his salary as ‘more than £35,000 a 
year’, said: ‘The industry I work in is quite narrow and there just 
aren’t the same job opportunities in Wales for me.

‘I
 can’t say it wouldn’t be nice  to get a job that was closer to  home, 
but at the moment that is just not possible and I am very happy where I 
am.’

His partner Sarah has a ‘very important and stressful job with South Wales Police’, he added.

It is not just the free time Gary Egan is forced to sacrifice with his gruelling six-hour commute every day.

Overall the commute sets the father-of-two back an estimated £15,000 a year.

Mr Egan says he pays £900-a-month on diesel while he also forks out more than £1,600 on toll fees.

On top of this of course Mr Egan, a regular customer at his local garage, has to pay his insurance, MOT and servicing costs.

‘We
 have discussed the options  for a move, but we feel that our  quality 
of life is much better here than it would be closer to my workplace,’ he
 said. ‘I like to run and on a weekend within five minutes of leaving my
 front door, I’m running along the beach. Everyone is so friendly here, 
there’s a real community spirit where neighbours genuinely want to 
help.’

Before moving to 
Porthcawl 18 months ago, Mr Egan lived in Colchester and faced a 75-mile
 drive to work via the M25 that took an hour and 40 minutes.

‘We decided for the extra hour or so on top we might as well move somewhere further away which was a nicer place,’ he said.

Since
 moving to Wales, he sometimes stays near Watford – in rented 
accommodation or a hotel – if he is working late, but generally prefers 
to go home.

Mr Egan (left, on his way to work and, right, after his commute, at his workplace in Watford) says the crippling hours mean he loses out on quality time with his partner Sarah and he has had to cut down his exercise regime

‘I use the 
journey home to sort my day out in my head and to make a plan for the 
following day,’ he said. ‘I use the time to take important conference 
calls – hands-free, of course – and my car is quite tech-savvy so I can 
listen to my text messages.

‘But there are times when I have to get Sarah to call me to make sure I don’t fall asleep at the wheel.’

Last
 night an AA spokesman described Mr Egan’s commute as a sign of the 
‘enormous pressure on people to stay in employment and keep the family 
stable and happy’.

He added: ‘But people driving these sort of distances
 every day do get used to it. It is a sign of the times and the pressure
 of modern life.

‘The AA 
recommends all drivers should take a driving break every two hours for 
ten or 20 minutes.

'Where this gentleman is particularly vulnerable is 
when the weather gets really awful and he could end up being held up or 
having his journey disrupted by snow.’
