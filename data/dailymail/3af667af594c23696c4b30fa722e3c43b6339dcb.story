At 23st 9lbs, Gillian Close was so mortified by her size that she refused to take her children up to the school gates for fear of being judged by the other parents.

Her shame made her hide from the other mothers, bidding goodbye to her three children round the block from the entrance to their Catholic comprehensive school - but also spurred her on to finally lose the weight that was making her life a misery.

The obese mother-of-three, 39, has now lost a incredible 13 stone. Nowadays, she proudly drops her children off at school, chats to the parents and teachers - and goes for a six-mile jog afterwards.

Gillian lost an incredible 13 stone in weight dropping from 23st 9lbs and size 26 to 10st 4lbs and size 12

Gillian used to be so ashamed of her weight that she wouldn'­t take her children to school, but now, Gillian proudly drops them at the gates and even goes for a six-mile jog afterwards

At her heaviest, Gillian tipped the scales at 23 stone and 9lbs and was a size 26.

She has now managed to lose 13 stone 5lbs, weighing in at a trim 10 stone 4lbs and has lost 7 dress sizes to drop to a svelte 12.

Gillian, a civil servant from Peterlee, County Durham said: 'No-one wants to be the fat mum at the school gates and I knew some of my children’s classmates had made jibes about me being fat.

'So I wouldn’t drop my kids all the way to school. I convinced myself I was doing it to give them space but really, it was because I was too embarrassed to be seen by the other parents and kids.

'But now, I walk with them to the entrance and talk to all the teachers and mums at the gates. The kids love that I pick them up from school.'

Gillian totally changed her diet to drop the weight, cutting out snacking on unhealthy treats like crisps and chocolate

Following her amazing weight loss, Gillian has become an avid runner. She is often spotted in her jogging gear at the school gates.

Gillian says: 'I go running up to four times a week. So the other parents usually see me drop my kids off and then head straight out for a jog. In fact, a lot of the mums have taken up running since!'

Gillian piled on the pounds after having three children - Matthew, 15, Jamie, 12, and Aaron, 10 - in five years.

She explains: 'I had been overweight on and off for most of my life and then I had kids in quick succession which didn’t help.

'When I returned to work, I would sit at my desk all day and snack on crisps and chocolate. As you can expect, the weight continued to creep up.

Gillian has now taken up running, and other mothers have even started to join her on jogs after seeing her transformation

'I was miserable. I didn’t like the way I looked or the way people perceived me. I wanted to be invisible.'

Gillian decided to ditch the weight for good in January 2012, after avoiding social functions during the festive period because she was too humiliated about her appearance to attend.

'I rejected all the invites to Christmas parties. I just didn’t want to go out and have my picture taken. But when the New Year came along, I decided enough was enough and that I was going to make a fresh start.'

BREAKFAST: Two slices of white toast with full-fat butter and jam

MID-MORNING SNACK: A packet of crisps and a few biscuits

LUNCH: Tuna mayonnaise sandwich and a slice of cake

MID-AFTERNOON SNACK: Chocolate bar

SUPPER: Chicken nuggets and chips or creamy pasta

BREAKFAST: Two slice of wholemeal toast with low-fat cheese triangles

MID-MORNING SNACK: Grapes and oranges

LUNCH: Subway Salad or Jacket potato with baked beans

MID-AFTERNOON SNACK: Banana

SUPPER: Chicken stir-fry or Roast pork, potatoes and vegetables

She joined Slimming World, began a healthy diet and the pounds fell away. After losing six stone, she slowly started incorporating exercise into her routine and took up running.

Gillian - who reached her goal weight last August - is planning to run a half-marathon this year.

Gillian added: 'Losing the weight has changed my life. My family are much happier and healthier. The Slimming World meal plan is so versatile and compatible that they have re-hauled their diets too.

'My husband, Gordon, is thrilled to see me have more confidence. I used to hide away but this Christmas, we were out and about at plenty of parties.'
