Kevin Keegan may have been out for football for six years, but he showed he’s lost none of his verve as he sang, danced and teased presenter James Corden about his weight on Sky 1 show A League Of Their Own.

The former England manager was on Jamie Redknapp’s red team, and took to the programme with gusto as he was relentlessly mocked for his infamous ‘love it’ rant at Sir Alex Ferguson when Newcastle boss in 1996.

Before he even entered the stage he was met with by England cricketer Andrew Flintoff running at him half-naked, in what was a sign of things to come for the 63-year-old.

Keegan sang his heart out, much to the enjoyment of team captains Redknapp and Howard 

After being mocked for his dodgy haircuts as a player, and boy were they dodgy, host James Corden showed a clip of Keegan performing the song he released, ‘Head Over Heels in Love’, in 1979.

Rather than being bashful about the clip, Keegan leapt onto Redknapp’s knee and gave an a capella version of the song. 

Before long, host Corden, Flintoff and the other team captains - comedian Russell Howard and actor Jack Whitehall - were joining in with the old crooner.

Even Saturdays’ singer Una Foden looked impressed. Well, sort of.

James Corden, the show's presenter, mocked Keegan for his haircuts as a player - like this one from 1977

Ever the showman, Keegan jumped into the crowd to serenade a group of girls with his 1979 song that reached No 31 in the UK charts

The Yorkshireman's last job in management was his second spell at Newcastle, which ended in 2008

Keegan also gave as good as he got, teasing Corden about his weight.

The Yorkshireman said anyone would have had a good physique with the intense training regime he had to go through as a player at Hamburg, before adding 'actually, not you’ to the portly host.

The joke prompted a high-five from cricket legend Flintoff.  

There was also a tender moment between Keegan and Redknapp when the Sky Sports presenter spoke of his admiration for the former Hamburg star as a player. Sportsmail's Redknapp called Keegan, ‘a legend. Like Wayne Rooney and Luis Suarez rolled into one.’

Soon after, Keegan and Redknapp were teaming up to paint lubricant onto Howard and send him hurtling into foam bowling pins, before the trio were hoisted into mid-air and asked to perform a dance move while answering trivia questions.

Fittingly, the show finished with Keegan performing his song again and, ever the showman, he headed into the crowd to share the moment with the audience.

Most importantly, did Keegan enjoy himself?

He loved it.
