A teenager claims to be so terrified of most food that she refuses to eat anything apart from tinned spaghetti. 

College student Leah Frost, from Leeds, has shunned most other foods since she was a child, despite the best efforts of her mother, Yvonne.

She has tried everything to persuade her 17-year-old daughter to have a varied diet, including therapy, but nothing has worked.

Leah Frost only eats tinned spaghetti, white bread, cheese, chips and sponge cake due to food phobia that has made her scared to try other foods

The only other foods Leah has been persuaded to add to her limited menu are chips, bread, cheese and sponge cake.

Even the food Leah eats must be specific brands and varieties.

The
 tinned spaghetti must be Heinz, the bread must be Warburton's and it 
must be Lancashire cheese from the supermarket Morrisons.

Yet despite her poor high fat, sugar and carbohydrate laden diet Leah remains a svelte size eight

She said: 'If someone puts something down in front of me and I know it isn't right it makes me feel anxious and scared to eat it.

'Even with the food I do eat it has to be right. Like with chips - I can't just eat any chips.

'It puts me in some difficult situations when I'm out with my friends because a lot of them don't know how bad my phobia is.'

Ms Frost thinks Leah's phobia stems from when she was a baby and she tried to breast feed despite not producing any milk.

As a result Leah's weight fell for five weeks before her mother was told she should be bottle-feeding her baby.

She said: 'I felt responsible for starving my baby, so then I just let her eat what she want.

'I was told by doctors that if I just put food in front of her eventually she would be hungry enough to eat it, but having starved my daughter once I didn't want to do it again.

'We've tried everything - I've even sent her to have cognitive behavioural therapy, but after having it for a year the only progress she had made was to try a slice of raw carrot and she still didn't like it.'

Leah said: 'I was a bridesmaid at my auntie's wedding and she knows about my food phobia so she had a chat with the caterers to arrange for me to have a cheese sandwich.

'But when it came out I took one look at it and knew I couldn't eat it.

'It was on what most people would probably consider really nice bread with seeds, and the cheese was thick. They'd even put a little flag in the top.

'I had to slip it over to my mum when nobody was looking.'

Leah's mother and boyfriend will offer to take food for her if they can see she is uncomfortable.

But the unhealthy diet is already having a detrimental effect on her health. She feels tired all the time and her iron count is low.

Ms Frost, 45, said: 'Both Leah and I do worry about what she's putting her body through.

'She complains of feeling tired all the time and she has regular blood tests that always come back with some sort of deficiency.

'We got through phases where we will try really hard to get her to eat more normal food, and then we go back to square one when we realise that she's never going to change.'

Sarah Hanratty, an expert nutritionist, said: 'This diet is lacking in key micronutrients and is high in refined carbohydrate.

'Over the longer-term a diet like this can lead to insulin resistance possibly resulting in diabetes and obesity.'

SED is also known as picky eating, fussy eating, food phobia, selective eating, or Perseverative Feeding Disorder.

It is more common among those within the autistic spectrum and in combination with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

It starts in childhood or early adolescence and the
 most common cause of SED is a development of extra sensitive taste sensation, which is caused 
by an increase in fungiform papilla – taste buds - throughout childhood.

Typically
 the food preferred by an SED sufferer are ‘comfort foods’ – bland and 
refined foods, high in carbohydrates – such as pizza, cheese and chips, 
often from particular brands or food outlets.

The types of food will be restricted to ten or less with extreme cases only eating one or two types of food.

SED
 sufferers can get psychiatric help such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
 and other treatments for OCD which have been successful.
