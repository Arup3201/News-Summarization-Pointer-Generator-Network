The UK Independence Party is set to win its first parliamentary seat tomorrow as voters were poised to deliver a bloody nose to both the Tories and Labour.

Douglas Carswell, the former Tory MP who defected to UKIP this summer is expected to hold his seaside constituency of Clacton in Essex by a landslide.

Polls have put him on course to win up to 6,000 more votes than the Conservatives, in what is set to be a humiliating by-election defeat for David Cameron.

Labour are expected to cling on in the northern seat of Heywood and Middleton, where another by-election was triggered by the death of local MP Jim Dobbin.

But UKIP, who have made political capital out of child abuse scandals in nearby Rochdale and Rotherham and fears about immigration, are set to run them a close second, which would raise more concerns about Ed Miliband's leadership.

Mr Cameron has all but conceded the Conservatives cannot win Clacton, which has high unemployment and contains the most deprived ward in the country. The Prime Minister made a last ditch visit to the seat last week, and acknowledged the Tories were 'the underdogs'.

The Conservative candidate fighting Mr Carswell is Giles Watling, an actor best known for his appearance as the vicar in the 1980s sitcom 'Bread', who is from the area and has been a local councillor for several years.

A few cabinet ministers and MPs have visited the seaside town in recent weeks to campaign, but the party largely held back in order to throw more resources at the next by-election in Rochester and Strood, in Kent, next month triggered by the defection of fellow Tory MP Mark Reckless.

Mr Reckless has a small lead in the polls, but the Conservatives believe they can hold it, and will head there on Friday afternoon after the Clacton result to campaign. Mr Cameron said they would 'throw everything we can' at keeping the seat. 

Securing the first seat in the Commons will mark a major breakthrough for UKIP, with leader Nigel Farage hoping it will act as a springboard for other wins at the general election

Labour have approached the northern by-election tonight with increasing panic amid concerns that Ed Miliband is not in touch with the voters about immigration.

One MP said yesterday that if UKIP finished within 2,000 votes of Labour there 'alarm bells would start ringing' about Mr Miliband. The MP, who did not wish to be named, said it would suggest that the direction of the party 'was not one that was appealing to our core voters'.

A study last week found that the UKIP surge could prevent Labour taking dozens of Tory target seats at the next election.

John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said Labour was not doing enough to address the UKIP threat in many northern, working-class seats.

Mr Mann said: 'Labour needs to squeeze the space that UKIP is trying to squeeze into, which is attracting low-paid working class voters and their concerns, which are pay, immigration and the NHS. If we don't, we won't win – it's as simple as that.'

'That voice isn't represented in Labour's policies. It's a fundamental weakness and if Ed Miliband wants to become Prime Minister he needs to address that.'

UKIP are also hoping for a strong showing in the by-election in Heywood and Middleton, where Nigel Farage campaigned yesterday, climbing on to a tank for the cameras

Senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge said all mainstream parties are set to be punished at the ballot box, because they are not listening to real people's concerns.

Mrs Hodge, MP for Barking, which caused shockwaves in 2006 by electing a dozen BNP councillors said: 'People are moving away to UKIP, the BNP or the SNP as a protest vote against the mainstream political parties not connecting with the electorate. Trust is in danger of breaking down.'

Kent and Essex are key areas where Labour must pick up marginal seats if they want to win the next general election. But in Clacton, which Labour held under Tony Blair with different boundaries when it was known as Harwich, their vote is set to be squeezed by UKIP.

Labour managed to poll 25 per cent of the vote in Clacton in 2010 at the height of Gordon Brown's unpopularity and their vote share is predicted to drop this time. Yesterday, local councillor Tim Young claimed yesterday that immigration is 'not an issue' in the area 'in terms of numbers' as there are few migrants there.

He added: 'I think it's being stoked up a bit by what UKIP are saying. But it isn't the first issue that comes up on the doorstep. That's been the NHS and street lights.'
