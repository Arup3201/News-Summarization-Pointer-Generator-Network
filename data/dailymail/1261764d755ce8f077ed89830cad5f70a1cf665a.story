Samuel Eto'o has revealed he would like to personally apologise to Jordan Henderson for a horror tackle on the midfielder during Chelsea's Premier League win over Liverpool, but has hit back at critics claiming the forward should have been penalised for a foul on Luis Suarez.

The Chelsea striker was heavily involved in the Premier League clash and scored Chelsea's winning goal which incensed Liverpool players as they felt the Cameroonian should have been sent off for raking a boot down Henderson's shin in the fourth minute.

Referee Howard Webb awarded Liverpool a free-kick for the challenge but failed to brandish even a yellow card in Eto'o's direction.

Speaking of the Henderson tackle, Eto'o told the Sun: 'Maybe I should have been sent off.

'But I'm not the referee. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but we must respect the decisions from the officials.

'During the match in the first moments, the game was passionate on both sides, but people know I'm not violent.

'I was really sad to see Jordan (Henderson) on the floor - I want to take this opportunity to say sorry.'

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers felt as though his side had once again been hard-done by, particularly when Eto'o cut across the run of Suarez in Chelsea's penalty area with the score at 2-1.

However, Webb was looking directly at the incident and decided to let the game continue.

The 32-year-old forward feels Webb's decision to wave play on was the correct one and doesn't believe he fouled Liverpool's star man.

Eto'o added: 'The ref did his job. He was two metres away from us.

'We can't all be the ref and it's easy for people to talk when they are far away.

'Yes, there was contact, but I didn't commit a foul.'Â
