According to Who’s Who, Clarissa Dickson Wright’s recreations were ‘hunting, shooting, fishing, food, rugby, men’.

This most extravagant of characters was being uncharacteristically economical, for she could easily have added ‘exploding shibboleths’ to that list.

Though she will be remembered by millions as a TV chef, Miss Dickson Wright, whose death was announced yesterday, was more influential and complex than that plastic term suggests. She was a former lawyer, an alcoholic and a daughter of wealth who plunged into penury through her own profligate faults.

Incidentally, she disliked the noun ‘chef’. ‘I am,’ she would say, nostrils flaring, ‘a cook. Chefs are forever stacking and arranging the food. They forget what the food was about in the first place.’

It was a typically no-nonsense, ego-pricking statement. As soon as a dish was out of the oven she slopped it up on a plate and got stuck in. Years of posing by poncy TV chefs went down the drain!

Clarissa was, in her eventful life, a pheasant plucker, master butcher, author, restaurateur, businesswoman and Lord Rector of Aberdeen University.

She was also a campaigner, particularly for field sports and farmers’ markets. She was the most prominent supporter of the Countryside Alliance, throwing her considerable weight behind rural people’s desire to see off the nanny state and be left to their own devices.

Clarissa was one of those countrywomen who, if told not to do something, are more likely to do it.

Was this not the essence of the woman? She was disobedient. Magnificently so.

In the public’s mind, she will forever be the larger half of the Two Fat Ladies cookery show, the one in the motorbike sidecar with a daft helmet that looked more like a Lancaster bomber pilot’s headgear.

She was the one whose accent was as clipped as a stately home’s yew hedge. With it went a politically incorrect approach to hygiene, both in the kitchen and in her language. Boy, she could be withering when she wished.

More than any of these, however, Clarissa was a state of mind, an attitude, a two-fingered rebuke to convention. She bridled at officialdom. She saw that the man (or woman) in the ministry was often a fool.

And like many people who ride in motorbike sidecars, she had a fatalistic side. She accepted that life had its potholes and sharp corners. The very fact that she had lived so much made her doubly, trebly human.

Clarissa Theresa Philomena Aileen Mary Josephine Agnes Elsie Trilby Louise Esmerelda Dickson Wright was born in 1947, the youngest of four children of a celebrated London surgeon and his soft-hearted Australian heiress wife. Clarissa loved her mother Molly. She hated her father Arthur.

Her memoirs Spilling The Beans (2007) accused him of being a violent drunk. ‘The first time I saw my father hit my mother I was six,’ she wrote.

Arthur was a surgeon to the Royal Family and his circle included Harry Secombe, Yehudi Menuhin and Alexander Fleming. The family lived in a nine-bedroom house in London’s smart St John’s Wood and the appearance was one of prosperous distinction.

Clarissa claimed otherwise. She told of her father beating his wife and using physical violence against his children.

These stories have been challenged by her sister and niece. What seems less open to dispute is that Clarissa saw herself as a victim. Perhaps this most melancholy of women was trying to understand why, in her middle years, she fell so dreadfully into the bottle.

All those Christian names sound more like roll-call at a convent school. She said that the last one, Esmerelda, was in memory of her father’s favourite pig.

Was he signalling a lack of interest in his fourth child? He later said she was an ‘unwanted’ addition to the family. It may explain the sadness in those bloodhound eyes, the slight droopiness of the mouth.

She was happier at boarding school (the Sacred Heart, in Hove) than at home. Her headmistress, Mother Joan, asked her why this should be and Clarissa told her about her father’s roughness.

Mother Joan told her she was a wicked child to speak so ill of a fine, upstanding man and reported her remarks to Arthur. ‘It took me years to trust anyone again,’ wrote Clarissa.

The old man wanted her to go into medicine. She chose the law and became a barrister (the youngest female barrister in England) in 1968. She claimed to have been a contemporary of Tony Blair and said he had the camp nickname ‘Miranda’.

In fact, she was called to the Bar eight years before Blair.

The law, at least in those days, was a place of Rumpole lunches and Bar dinners. Clarissa, once a slender, slightly bohemian figure, threw herself into the party scene.

Her diabetic father was also a drinker - his breakfast orange juice was allegedly laced with vodka. Her mother’s death in 1975 distressed her greatly and she started drinking hard. She later wrote that she thought alcohol was ‘the key to the universe, the abatement of pain’.

Some said she was a good enough lawyer to have become Lord Chancellor one day. Drink and rebelliousness prevented that. At her local pub in Sussex they would give her four double gins and two small tonics in a pint mug when she arrived for the evening.

Her legal career collapsed, but she had enough money (an inheritance of £2.8million) to be able to ignore this. But in 1982 she went off the rails after the death of her boyfriend, an insurance salesman called Clive — ‘the only real love of my life,’ she wrote.

They had conducted an affair for 14 years, much of it in restaurants (until they were thrown out for becoming too rowdy).

When the drink killed Clive, she started a mad bout of boozing and one-night stands, including an assignation with an unnamed MP in the Commons - she claimed they made love behind the Speaker’s Chair.

During that time, when she was bouncing off walls in Kilburn pubs and bedding Irish republican sympathisers, she sought solace in two pints of gin a day. It was washed down with so much tonic that, she claimed, the quinine finally damaged her adrenal gland.

She twice slept on benches at London’s Victoria coach station.

She eventually came to her senses and, with her brother’s encouragement, went to Alcoholics Anonymous. She gave up drink and ended up running the Books For Cooks bookshop in Notting Hill, a honeypot for creative types.

A TV producer friend suggested she meet Jennifer Paterson, the eccentric office cook at the Spectator magazine.

They were teamed in 1996 as the Two Fat Ladies and a TV hit (the Queen Mother’s favourite) was minted. It was, wrote Clarissa, ‘a great achievement for two old bats’.

Though they were less close than the cameras suggested, there was a perfect chemistry. Jennifer gurgled with laughter, delighted in practical jokes and slowly roasted herself in the juices of conviviality.

She was a good 20 years older than her co-star, yet she radiated an almost childlike delight.

Clarissa was more private, bookish and acid. She was prone to bouts of introspection and anger at the modern world. The Left loathed her forthright opinions but she should have been a feminist pin-up: an intelligent woman unfazed that she looked so unpretty.

After Jennifer’s death, Clarissa could have disappeared. That she did not was evidence that she had struck a public chord.

Fans loved her plain speaking and contempt for health and safety (she thought environmental health officers a particular menace).

Despite that la-di-dah accent, she had no time for snobbery. She was uninterested in hierarchy, except the gradations of egg sizes and the relative merits of decent vinegar.

Proper country pursuit: Clarissa out hunting

I saw her sail past lots of famous faces at a London party to bury herself in conversation with a junior publishing assistant.

She revelled in making modern, urban, moist-palmed Britain re-examine its platitudes and justify its incorrigibly spongy-brained ways.

Her long support for hunting probably cost her thousands of book sales. She cared not one jot. To her - and she was a considerable animal lover - the case against hunting was emotive and misguided.

She considered hunting to be a perfectly proper country pursuit and could not abide the busy-body animal rights brigade who seemed to know a great deal less about animal welfare than the rural people they criticised.

She was a bird-watcher, but also a bird eater. Pink-foot geese? Yes, she said, beautiful creatures - and with a very delicate flavour.

Her views often got her in trouble. Two years ago, she suggested that instead of a ministry cull, we should start eating badgers. After all, badger was once a regular dish for working men and in her youth she claimed to have seen badger hams in West Country pubs.

‘Just like a jamon iberico,’ she said.

At first, one thought this is outrageous. But then, on further consideration, one realised that she maybe had a point.

Clarissa Dickson Wright distrusted modernism and smouldered with disdain for soppy sentimentalism.

She was a stonking, snorting original and perhaps the only surprising thing is that, after the lakes of booze she drank earlier in her life, she made it to 66.
