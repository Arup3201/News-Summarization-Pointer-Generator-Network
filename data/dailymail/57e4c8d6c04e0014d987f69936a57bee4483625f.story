A pharmacist who bludgeoned a defenceless pensioner to death with a crucifix in a violent and drunken attack has been jailed for life.

Karen Walsh, 45, from Newry, County Down, Northern Ireland launched the attack on her elderly 81-year-old neighbour Maire Rankin on Christmas Day 2008.

She tore clumps of hair from her head and inflicted head injuries and 
broken ribs on her victim, while a crown of thorns left a distinctive bruise on her chin.

Following the sustained assault Walsh then sexually assaulted Mrs Maire Rankin, 81, before fleeing to her home at the house next door.

A jury at Belfast Crown Court found her guilty with a unanimous verdict after retiring for just under two hours at the end of the trial.

Following the verdict, Mr Justice Anthony Hart warned Walsh she would serve a lengthy sentence.

'Whatever happened on that night, this was a brutal attack on an elderly and defenceless woman,' he said.

As Walsh was led away ashen-faced she turned and told the judge: 'I am totally innocent.'

Broken: Walsh's attack was so frenzied that the body of Jesus on the crucifix snapped

Speaking outside court, the victim's daughter, Emily Rankin, said her mother was a kind and caring person who spent her life helping people.

'She had the right to feel secure in her own home but because of 
her trusting nature and kindness, she was subjected to a frenzied 
assault and a horrific murder.

'She died alone - and frightened.'

Earlier the court had heard that Walsh had admitted visiting her neighbour's home on Christmas Eve to take her a bottle of vodka as a present but she claimed that when she left she was still alive.

A detective told the trial she spoke to Walsh on Christmas morning when she discovered she had been with the victim the previous evening.

She said Walsh asked whether Ms Rankin had been beaten and whether the door of her house had been open.

Another police officer told the court that when she was arrested on December 27 2008, the accused had replied: 'I can't believe this. It is bizarre.'

A DNA expert also told the murder trial that the chances of DNA on the victim's chin coming from someone other than the killer was one in a billion.

DNA which could have come from the accused was also found on the pensioner's breasts and on the bottom of the crucifix.

According to Northern Ireland's state pathologist, Ms Rankin had bruising on her chin consistent with a crown of thorns, like that on Jesus' head.

Professor Jack Crane said considerable force had been used to cause extensive bruising to the face and scalp and that Ms Rankin had been subjected to a series of punches or blows with a blunt instrument.

The pensioner also suffered 15 broken ribs, which Prof Crane said may have been caused after death and said there was evidence of injuries indicating a sexual assault.

Praise: Detective Inspector John Caldwell paid tribute to the victim's family outside court after the verdict

Following the verdict, Police Service of Northern Ireland Detective Inspector John Caldwell paid tribute to the victim's family.

'They have lost Maire's company because of the terrible and depraved action of someone they trusted as a neighbour,' he said.

He added that she deserved to live in safety.

'For the last three years Karen Walsh has told lies. Today the jury saw through the lies and convicted her of murder,' he added.
