Manchester United's fall from grace has been the source of great merriment for rival fans and the launch of the new iPhone has inspired another dig.

With Louis van Gaal's side languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, one wag thought it would be a humorous way of showing off Apple's latest gadget.

United fans would have had difficulty spotting their team when viewing the Premier League table on an iPhone 5s or iPhone 6.

But the larger screen of the iPhone 6 Plus has enough space to show the top 14 clubs, which conveniently includes Manchester United.

The iPhone 6 Plus is significantly bigger than any phone Apple has launched before, though obviously much smaller than an iPad mini. The dimensions are: 6.22 inches (15.8cm) in length, 3.06 inches (7.78 cm) wide, though it is very thin at 0.28 inch (0.7 cm). 

The iPhone is due to be launched on September 19 with an eye-watering price tag of £789 for the new 128GB model.

By then United fans will hope their huge investment in Angel di Maria, Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind will have resulted with a move up the table.
