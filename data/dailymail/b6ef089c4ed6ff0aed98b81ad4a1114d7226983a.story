Priorities: Bernard Hogan-Howe joins the Metropolitan police at a time of change and difficulty

A plain-speaking police chief renowned for his ruthless obsession with cutting crime was yesterday appointed head of the beleaguered Metropolitan Police.

Bernard Hogan-Howe, 53, vowed to put fear back in the minds of criminals after winning the race to become commissioner at Scotland Yard.

Britain’s new top officer faces an enormous task trying to restore morale in the Met in the aftermath of the phone hacking scandal, widespread criticism of the force’s handling of the London riots and concerns about burglary and robbery figures.

He will also assume overall responsbility for counter-terrorism in the run up to next year’s Olympic Games in London.

Mr Hogan-Howe is the force’s third chief appointed in six years following the controversial exits of his two predecessors, Sir Ian Blair and Sir Paul Stephenson, making it the hottest seat in British policing.

He was handed a five-year contract after convincing interviewers he could lead a ‘new, more transparent’ era for the force.

The former Merseyside chief constable could not disguise his delight at landing the job. ‘It’s the highest accolade that any police officer could have,’ he said.

Outlining his targets, he added: ‘The idea is to make the criminals fear the police and what they are doing now.’

One of Mr Hogan-Howe’s priorities will be ensuring the Olympic Games pass off peacefully at a time of unprecedented police funding squeezes.

He is expected to run a tight ship at the Yard and will move quickly to shake up the Met’s senior management team. Assistant Commissioner Cressida Dick is tipped as a strong contender to be his deputy.

Mr Hogan-Howe beat off a strong challenge from Sir Hugh Orde, the much respected but outspoken president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, to land the £276,000 a year job.

The other contenders were acting commissioner Tim Godwin, who now reverts to being deputy commissioner but who is expected to leave the Met in the next few months, and Strathclyde’s chief constable Steve House.

A number of members of the Metropolitan 
Police Authority were keen for Sir Hugh to be appointed but Home 
Secretary Theresa May, who has been angered by Sir Hugh’s attacks on 
government policy, was never likely to sanction such a move.

She said: ‘Bernard has an excellent track record as a tough single-minded crime fighter. He showed that in his time as chief constable of Merseyside, and I’m sure he’s going to bring those skills and that ability to fight crime to the Metropolitan Police here in London.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson said: ‘It was a very strong field but I think the Home Secretary and I were agreed that Bernard’s performance was outstanding, and he really commended himself above all by his relentless focus on building on the work of Sir Paul Stephenson and Tim Godwin in driving down crime.’

Mr Hogan-Howe was parachuted into the Met as acting deputy commissioner after Sir Paul and Britain’s anti-terror chief, assistant commissioner John Yates, quit in quick succession.

The surprise move was a clear indication that he was in line for the top job on a permanent basis.

He had previously been working for Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary.

Bernard Hogan-Howe is an advocate of zero tolerance policing and waged what he called a ‘total war on crime’ against the gangsters and villains of Merseyside when he was chief constable there.

It worked. During his five years in charge, from 2004 to 2009, crime was reduced by almost a third and anti-social behaviour by 25 per cent. A force which had once been rated the worst in the country for public confidence became one of the country’s best.

Everyone from vandals to drug-takers to fare dodgers was targeted. And, when Mr Hogan-Howe was unhappy with the sentences they were given by the courts, he was not afraid to say so.

He has been nicknamed Eliot Ness – the legendary lawman in Prohibition America whose hand-picked team of Untouchables brought down Al Capone – for his zero-tolerance on gun and knife crime.

Mr Hogan-Howe led his officers in Merseyside as they investigated some of the most sensitive and appalling crimes of recent years, including the racist killing of Anthony Walker, a black student, with an ice axe and the gun murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jones – the innocent victim of a gangland feud.

The Rhys Jones investigation, considered incredibly challenging because of the culture of silence attached to gangs, saw officers cleverly recruit a teenage supergrass as their main prosecution witness in order to crack the case. Such experiences will stand him in good stead at the Met, where tackling the gang culture blamed for last month’s riots will be one of his most important jobs.

He will also need all his experience of handling delicate racial problems in the wake of the fatal shooting which proved the trigger for widespread destruction.

The married 53-year-old, an avid football fan who is a tough-tackler on the pitch, began his career in his native Sheffield in 1979. Identified as a high-flyer, he was sent to Oxford University by the police. He has an MA in law from Oxford, a diploma in applied criminology from the University of Cambridge and an MBA from the University of Sheffield.

If that sets alarm bells ringing – the very politically-correct Sir Ian Blair had a similarly academic background – Mr Hogan-Howe is said to have drawn experience from another ex-Met Commissioner: Sir John Stevens.

As an assistant commissioner at the Met from 2001 to 2004, he watched as Sir John ran the force with an iron-grip, leaving his officers in no doubt of what was expected of them. He will need a similarly robust attitude to bring order to the Met now. But few who saw him in action in Merseyside doubt he is up to the challenge.
