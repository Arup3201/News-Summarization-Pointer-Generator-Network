This week, Canberra university student Louise Stockton has a lot of bills to pay.

The 25-year-old has expensive text books to buy and a large gas bill she will need to get a payment extension for.

In order to make ends meet, twice a week Ms Stockton goes diving in dumpsters for food.

'I really don't have that much money this week and if I can find a couple of loaves of bread it's going to make my week a lot easier,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 

Canberra students are increasingly turning to 'dumpster diving' for food for financial and ethical reasons

Dumpster divers say they find plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and bread

'If I'm going to find some heads of broccoli I can make some good meals this week.

'It means I can spend money on other things I need to buy.'

For Ms Stockton, student allowances from Centrelink and money from her casual job don't provide enough security.

'Centrelink payments can provide for the basics but there are variables,' she said.

'When you have to pay for unexpected medical costs or any sort of emergency comes up it's really hard to find the money to account for them.

'It's not as reliable as I think people seem to think that it is.'

She is one of a growing number of people turning to dumpster diving for financial, environmental and ethical reasons.

In winter students also pick up roast chickens, milk and yoghurt but they steer clear in the summer

Ms Stockton said the amount of fresh food she is able to find is incredible, and worth the risks

Ms Stockton says it's not without risk – she has come across used needles and broken glass while searching in large metal bins at odd hours of the night.

'When you're going through a dark alley at night you're not really sure what's going to be there,' she said.

Another Canberra student, Steve Skitmore, lives in community housing with 30 other students and as a co-op a large proportion of the food they eat comes from dumpster diving

'You have to be very careful, a lot of the time shop keepers see this as threatening their business, you know the idea that not buying something is taking something away from them.

'The way I see it you're not able to buy those products anyway.'

But Ms Stockton said the amount of fresh food she is able to find is incredible, and worth the risks.

'Bread is the most commonly thrown thing,' she said.

'After that lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.

'Anything that is probably fine to eat but doesn't look as pretty as it once did, you give it a wash and you cook it.'

In addition to the financial benefits, Mr Skitmore dumpster dives for environmental reasons.

'It's an understanding of the amount of waste that comes out of the industrial food industry,' he said.

'And the actual act of intervening within the amount of waste that comes in that.

'You get so much incredible stuff, and it's all edible as long as you're working along safety lines.'

The 27-year-old archaeology student said a Facebook page they set up for Canberra dumpster divers a few months ago had amassed followers 'exponentially' as more people turn to bins as a food source.

'The main reason we do it is we get so much fresh fruit and vegetables, which are pretty expensive when you buy it every few days,' Mr Skitmore said.

'A lot of really high-end stuff, that's the stuff the supermarkets don't sell that much of, like gourmet heirloom carrots.

'In winter we go for the meat and dairy which is also there in the summer but it's not food safe in the summer.'

Mr Skitmore said they also get plenty of herbs, potatoes, onions, hot roasted chickens, milk and gourmet yoghurts.

Two nights a week the group travels to shops in the centre of Canberra to dumpster dive.

He has lived and dumpster dived in other cities, including Brisbane, but said it is particularly easy in the nation's capital.

'We go there because the managers of those shops are really pretty supportive,' Mr Skitmore said.

'They are pretty onto knowing people are going through there so they make sure it's on top of layered cardboard.

'Compared to the bigger cities Canberra has a lot more understanding, there's a lot of pressure on students here.

'The rent's really high and there's limited housing available for students.'
