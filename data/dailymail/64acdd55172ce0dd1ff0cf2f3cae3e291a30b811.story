The chances of being involved in a fatal air crash in the U.S are now only one in 45 million, after 2012 saw the fewest commercial airline accidents in over half a century.

Last year’s figures were the lowest since 1945, seeing only 23 accidents and 475 fatalities, according to the Aviation Safety Network.

Researchers have said flying has become so reliable that a traveler could fly every day for 123,000 years before being involved in a fatal crash.

There are 10 million commercial flights a year in America and there has not been a fatal crash for four years.

Improvement in safety standards, more reliable planes and engines are the key factors in making flying among the safest mode of travel.

The last fatal accident in America  was on February 9th 2009 when a regional plane crashed while landing in snowy conditions in Buffalo, New York.

The crash was put down to pilot error after ice formed on the wing and the wrong maneuver was carried out.

There has not been a crash involving one of the major carriers since 2001 when an American Airlines flight crashed shortly after taking off from New York.

The Aviation Safety Network said advanced navigation and warning technology has sharply reduced accidents such as midair collisions and crashes into mountains in poor visibility.

Airlines and plane manufacturers are also sharing data about flying hazards with the aim of preventing accidents instead of just reacting to them.

Improved design of seats and hull structures of planes also make it more likely for passengers to survive a crash landing.

"The lessons of accidents used to be written in blood, where you have to have an accident, and you had to kill people to change procedures of policy, or training," said Deborah Hersmann, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board.

"That's not the case anymore. We have a much more proactive approach to safety."
