Older people at risk of going blind are being treated by a new X-ray procedure for the first time on the NHS.

The one-off treatment combats a form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a disease affecting around 250,000 Britons.

It targets the ‘wet’ variation of the condition in particular – which develops when abnormal blood vessels form under a tiny part of the retina called the macula.

Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has become the first NHS hospital in the UK to start offering appropriate patients a new non-invasive treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration

Monthly eye injections are the usual course of treatment, but the X-ray – called Oraya Therapy – has been found to almost halve the number needed.

And at £700 per injection, it means that costs for the NHS can be cut considerably while reducing the inconvenience for patients.

Some have not needed an injection for three years following the therapy, which delivers painless, highly- targeted low-level radiation similar to that used in dental X-rays.

‘Wet AMD is an aggressive form of one of the most common eye diseases,’ said Christopher Brand, consultant ophthalmologist at Sheffield’s Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

‘Treatment can often be uncomfortable, with patients needing injections on a monthly or two-monthly basis, or in perpetuity.

‘Current treatments can cost the NHS upwards of £700 per injection, so not only should Oraya Therapy benefit patients but it will also be more cost effective. Just two fewer injections per patient makes the treatment cost-effective.’

AMD normally affects people over the age of 60, with the wet form progressing particularly quickly. Around 26,000 people a year are diagnosed with wet AMD. There is no way of preventing the condition, however laser surgery and drugs can limit the damage it causes.

But doctors at the Sheffield hospital have started using Oraya Therapy to deliver a dose of radiation to the back of affected patients’ eyes. It is a non-invasive procedure that is over in just a few minutes.

The procedure works by drying up any leakage caused by the uncontrolled production of new blood vessels. By focusing the beams on the back of the eye, scarring is reduced

Mr Brand said a European clinical trial found treatment cut the need for monthly injections by 45 per cent on average – however patients still needed regular check-ups and some did better than others at avoiding top-up injections.

He added: ‘The ideal scenario is a patient needing no additional injections after once-only treatment with Oraya Therapy, and their condition becomes stable.

‘But injections are still a valuable option for many patients as the new treatment will not be appropriate for everyone.’

Sheila Brooks, an 83-year-old retired sewing machine operator from Sheffield, was one of the first to be treated with Oraya Therapy.

She said: ‘I was diagnosed with wet AMD in my left eye three years ago and since then I have had nine injections in the eye.

‘I don’t like the injections, nor the regular 28-mile round trip to the hospital, so the X-ray therapy was very appealing to me.’

The therapy is due to be used at NHS clinics in Birmingham, Manchester and other cities in England.
