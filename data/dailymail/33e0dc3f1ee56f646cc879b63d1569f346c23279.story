Lance Corporal Kyle Stock was looking forward to a new life with his partner Emma, and the baby they were expecting.

Having served in the army for eight years and surviving tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, he made the decision to leave the armed forces so he could lead a safer life with Emma Bloice.

But now the brave soldier will never have the chance to hold his daughter - as he was killed in a motorbike accident when Emma was four months pregnant with their baby Amber.

Emma Bloice was relieved Kyle had left the forces so they could bring up their baby Amber together - but then tragedy struck

Kyle Stock survived tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, but had vowed to lead a safer life for the sake of his family

Tragedy struck when 25-year-old Kyle was killed in May when the motorcycle he was riding crashed with a lorry in Grassington, North Yorkshire.

Now pride is tinged with sorrow as Emma, 30, knows Amber's father, who was about to begin a new career in engineering when his life was cruelly cut short, will never get to meet her.

Emma, of Birstall, West Yorkshire, gave birth to the couple's daughter two weeks ago and told how the couple had been thrilled to receive news of the pregnancy.

Emma said: 'I have had to be strong for Amber's sake. You can definitely see Kyle in her - she's got his chin and his eyes.'

Kyle completed a tour of duty in Iraq,
trained in bomb disposal and served in Northern Ireland and 
Afghanistan, after he joined the army when he was 16.

He was made Lance Corporal 
and was recommended for further promotion shortly before he left the 
Army after almost a decade in September 2011.

Emma and Kyle Stock's parents Joanne and Bryan will now remind Amber of the brave father that she never had the chance to meet

The pair met during a night out in Halifax in 2010. Emma said: 'I fell for him pretty quickly. He was funny, good looking and just an amazing person.

'We were both very happy and excited about the baby and had started getting the nursery ready.

'At the time we didn't know we were having a girl but we'd already chosen the name Amber. It's really helped having her to focus on. She's kept everybody going. Amber will know everything about her dad.'

Kyle's mother, Joanne, said: 'Amber is absolutely perfect and part of Kyle will live on in her.

'I was so relieved when he left the army because I thought I didn't have to worry about him any more but then the accident happened.'

Kyle also leaves behind sister Lauren, 19, and brothers Jake, 10, and Aaron, 18.

The number of deaths of British soldiers in Afghanistan since 2001 stands at 437 after two soldiers from 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles were shot dead by a man wearing a local police uniform on 30 October, the BBC reported.
