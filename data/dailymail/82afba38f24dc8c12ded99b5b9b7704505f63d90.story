Arsene Wenger believes the strong British core of his current Arsenal squad will ensure the team does not break-up.

Having ended their trophy drought against today’s opponents Hull City in last year’s FA Cup final, there is a belief the Gunners can go on to emulate some of Wenger’s previously successful sides.

Over the years Arsenal have begrudgingly allowed their top stars move to rival clubs; the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Robin van Persie have all left the Emirates Stadium in recent seasons despite the Wenger’s attempts to keep them.

Speaking at the club’s Annual General Meeting on Thursday, Wenger spoke of his determination to ensure the club’s playing staff develop an emotional affiliation with Arsenal.

Having been criticised over the years for a seeming reluctance to use British talent, Wenger has come full circle and now has seven key first-team members who are homegrown, including Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Aaron Ramsey and Danny Welbeck.

And Wenger is confident having a strong homegrown contingent will make it easier to ensure his current group doesn’t disband like previous squads.

‘Are English players more loyal? It’s easier for them,’ said the Frenchman.

‘When you buy a player from Barcelona at some stage he might want to go back to Barcelona because Barcelona is a big club as well.

‘A guy who is English, who is from London and plays for Arsenal, why should he go?

‘But we had loyalty from people like [Thierry] Henry and [Patrick] Vieira, too.

‘They had a lot of success here. They were respected here and respected the values here. They live in London - that is also a special attraction.’

Arsenal have failed to hold on to the likes of Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri in recent years

Five Arsenal players - Wilshere, Welbeck, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Kieran Gibbs and Calum Chambers - played for England in the European Championship qualifier against Estonia on Sunday.

And Wenger added: ‘I am very proud of that because for years I have been accused of not developing English players.

‘It shows you, when they are good, they play. In a good class you become better. That shows the good players will learn.’
