Connected homes and cities have been buzz words this year, but while urban areas are becoming increasingly smart, the countryside is being left behind.

A computer scientist is hoping to change this by launching a project that will take the Internet of Things (IOT) to an area of Wales.

Proposed ideas include sheep with digital collars, sensors on riverbanks, and rainfall monitors.

Computer scientist Professor Gordon Blair was recently awarded funding to investigate how the Internet of Things could work in the countryside. Proposed ideas include sheep with digital collars, (stock image) sensors on riverbanks and rainfall monitors

The project is being led by computer scientist Professor Gordon Blair from Lancaster University.

He was recently awarded £171,495 ($267,090) from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council to set up a ‘smart’ project in Conwy, Wales.

The aim is to investigate how IOT could work in the countryside.

In particular, Professor Blair will use the technology to tackle problems from flooding and agricultural pollution, to animal movements and drought.

Lancaster University proposes fitting sensors to the riverbanks to monitor river levels and warn of floods.

A similar system has already been installed by researchers from MIT to the Aguán River in Honduras.

This system uses sensors on the bank, and throughout neighbouring towns to track rising levels, or weather conditions.

They use a combination of 900 MHz and 144 MHz radio frequencies for data transmission, which means sensor clusters in the network can be as far apart as 34.2 miles (5km).

Some sensor locations are designated as ‘government office nodes' and have an office with a laptop computer where data is collected and stored.

An algorithm is then used to predict flood risks before alert notifications are displayed.

And if the storm knocks out the local electricity grid, solar-powered backup systems kick in. 

IOT is the idea that everyday objects can be connected to the web, and ‘enables object-to-object communication over the internet and real time data monitoring.’

One idea is to fit sheep with digital collars.

This could be used to track their movements, for example.

A recent BBC show fitted digital collars with cameras to cats to follow them, see where they went and how they interacted with their neighbourhood - and a sheep version could help farmers monitor livestock.

Alternatively, such digital collars could double up as Wi-Fi hotspots.

This could be a solution to typically poor broadband speeds and network coverage in the most rural regions of the UK.

At Glastonbury, EE installed Wi-Fi cows to act as similar hotspots.

Although these ‘cows’ were, in fact, just masts in the shape of the farmyard animals, the principle could work for livestock in the countryside.

Earlier this year, sheep in Yorkshire were fitted with cameras to give a unique view of the Tour De France as it travelled through the county.

Elsewhere, Lancaster University proposes fitting sensors to the riverbanks to monitor river levels and warn of floods.

Working with partners at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, The British Geological Survey and Bangor University, the project in Conwy will run for the next 18 months.

‘Applying this booming technology to the countryside presents challenges - for example how to build a network when there are mountains and trees in the way?’, explained the university.

But researchers believe the benefits could be huge.

Professor Gordon Blair said: 'Cities have been the focus of much of the boom in this type of technology, but the countryside faces challenges of its own, from environmental changes to flooding.' Internet of Things is the idea everyday objects can be connected to the web. An example of a connected city is pictured

Professor Blair added: ‘Cities have been the focus of much of the boom in this type of technology - it has been used to keep traffic flowing on our roads, monitor air pollution and even help us find a parking spot on a busy Saturday afternoon.

‘But the countryside faces challenges of its own, from subtle environmental changes to catastrophic events such as flooding.

‘The possibilities of bringing the Internet of Things to the countryside are limitless.

‘The next step will be to identify exactly what will be of most use in the short term and how we will frame the project.’
