David Cameron could win a parliamentary vote for air strikes on Iraq, it has been claimed

A leading Tory said he believed David Cameron could win a parliamentary vote for air strikes in Iraq, where the US is continuing its offensive against ISIS.

Sir Richard Ottaway, chair of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said there would be support for arming the Kurds – including carrying out air strikes if they request them.

Britain has so far contributed technical and humanitarian aid to stricken northern Iraq, but reports in the US suggest Barack Obama will ask the UK and Australia to join the air campaign.

Australia has already said it may send war planes if asked.

Sir Richard said he believed there would be support for targeting IS in northern Iraq, although Downing Street has said it no formal request had been made and it was not under discussion.

He said: ‘As far as Kurdistan is concerned I think there’s a case for arming the Peshmerga, and if they request it, for working with the US on air strikes, although this will need the support of Parliament.

‘My hunch on Iraq is that the view in Parliament has changed and there would be a majority there. Syria is not so straightforward, but I think the situation has changed in Iraq.’

The government suffered an embarrassing Commons defeat last year when 30 Conservative MPs and nine Lib Dems joined Labour in voting against a motion supporting the ‘principle’ of military action against Syria.

But Sir Richard said strikes against the jihadists in Iraq would be a ‘legitimate case’. He believed some of those MPs who opposed action in Syria last year would back it.

One unnamed minister said this week that the government would not want military action so close to a general election.

But Sir Richard said Britain, as a leading member of the EU and Nato and with a permanent seat on the UN security council had a responsibility to help the Kurds if they requested assistance.

‘If we think Kurdistan needs support, and might collapse without our support, then electoral thinking would be immaterial. We have to do what people expect of a country like Britain’, he said.

‘Britain has a longstanding interest in Kurdistan, it was established by John Major after the first Gulf War, it is a well-run country with a proper constitution, and respect for diplomacy, does not have the religious tensions we see elsewhere in the Middle East. It has a very important strategic position. The West should help Kurdistan.’

Any military action must be based on a thorough assessment of how the West can best help them, not a ‘knee jerk’ reaction, he said.

Barack Obama this week claimed that an international coalition of willing partners would help root out ISIS once and for all

Mr Obama has authorized surveillance flights over Syria, a move that could pave the way for US airstrikes against ISIS militant targets -- and for international coalition-building at the State Department

The UK is already sending technical support such as night vision goggles and body armour, and transporting ammunition from eastern European countries to the Kurds.

The US began targeted air strikes across northern Iraq on August 8. The US President is set to authorise new air raids around the town of Amerli where 12,000 Turkmen people are under siege from IS militants.

The administration is also considering targeting IS fighters in northern Syria. But Sir Richard said that in Syria MPs would be unlikely to accept any military action without far more intelligence and a clear exit strategy.

Tory MP Richard Ottaway said the PM may get parliamentary approval to attack ISIS

Australia’s defence minister David Johnston said their Super Hornet aircraft were ‘incredibly capable’ and in a ‘high state of readiness’ if action was approved.

‘They’re exactly what flies off US aircraft carriers’, Mr Johnston said. ‘Now, that’s an obvious first port of call were we to consider it necessary to participate with our friends and our ally.’

Prime Minister Tony Abbot told his parliament yesterday that the government had not received an official request to provide military assistance, but was in discussions with the US about it.

Mr Abbott described President Obama’s decision to authorise air strikes against the ‘murderous hoard’ of IS as being ‘to his great credit’, but said their involvement would need careful consideration.

However John Baron MP, who forced the Commons vote on military action in Syria last summer, in which the government was dramatically defeated, cautioned against air strikes in Iraq.

He said the Islamic State fighters must be defeated by local armies – not the West.

‘We have a certain responsibility to the Iraqi people to rid the country of Isis in the north but we must fully explore local options. The West must not be seen as trying to defeat this Caliphate – the symbolism would be very strong.

‘IS is not a disparate group of terrorists living in caves, but a well-organised and equipped guerrilla army which will be difficult to defeat through air strikes alone. The elephant in the room is the Iraqi Army, numbering over 250,000, which should be able to regain all lost territory quickly if properly organised and supported, against only 8,000 IS fighters.’
