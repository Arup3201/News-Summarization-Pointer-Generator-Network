What a quarter-final draw this will be. Every tie should be a brilliant contest. Of course the big three — Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid — are the favourites, and it’s hard to look beyond one of them, but you can’t rule anyone out.

Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid might seem the easier teams on paper, but Dortmund reached the final last year and Atletico are second in La Liga. PSG are so strong and United, for all their issues, can still cause sides problems.

I do think, though, that Chelsea have a chance to recreate the glory of 2012. They rode their luck that year, but the memories are still fresh and under Jose Mourinho they look fitter and stronger. He knows how to win big matches and nobody will fancy testing themselves against him.

Two wins in three years? Chelsea were underdogs to win in 2012 but they could replicate that famous win in Munich

Red hot favourites: Bayern Munich can become the first team in the Champions League era to successfully defend the trophy

Going through: Manchester United secured their place in the last eight with a thumping 3-0 win at Old Trafford

I think Chelsea could win it this season, I really do. Under Jose Mourinho they are aggressive, they press the ball and Jose loves being an underdog. He won’t want to play a team like Atletico because it will be a similar match, but against the bigger sides he knows what it takes to win.

They are defensively sound and with a good draw they could do it. You look at what they did in 2012 and you still can’t quite believe it. They are in better physical condition and the only thing that will hold them back is the lack of a top-class goalscorer.

STAR MAN: EDEN HAZARD

He has matured into an outstanding player this season and he has everything. When you look at his performances, it’s easy to forget just how young he still is.

Been there, done it: Jose Mourinho has won the Champions League with Porto and Inter Milan - can he become the first manager to do it with three clubs?

On a roll: In Eden Hazard, Chelsea have a player of the very highest calibre

It's amazing to think Manchester United are rank outsiders in this competition. Most teams would be happy to draw them, but nobody would want a second leg at Old Trafford.

It was a good display on Wednesday and if they get a result against City next week, their price might just change.

They are not a terrible team, it’s more of a confidence issue. A few more performances like the one against Olympiacos and they can restore some belief that has been lacking.

The quarter-final and clash with City will go a long way to deciding if David Moyes is still there next season.

STAR MAN: ROBIN VAN PERSIE

He’s been disappointing and will have been stung by criticism, but top players always produce, as he did on Wednesday night.

The catalyst: Manchester United fought back from the bring, beating Olympiacos 3-0 at Old Trafford to seal their spot in the last eight

Flying Sutchman: The form of Robin van Persie will be key to United's chances of progression in the competition

Atletico have a real aggressive nature to their team this season.

Last year Jurgen Klopp was the unknown man but this year it’s Diego Simeone. He has his team very well organised and is always barking orders on the touchline. I’ve been impressed with Arda Turan and Koke, and Diego Costa is a real star striker.

STAR MAN: DIEGO COSTA 

So strong and if anybody looks like a Mourinho player, it’s Costa.

Suits you, sir: Diego Simeone (left) and Diego Costa have been integral to Atletico Madrid's resurgence in form

How's stat: Gabi is top of the charts when it comes to fouls committed by any player left in the competition

Barcelona are always in the frame but you can’t help but think of last year’s 7-0 aggregate defeat by Bayern.

They missed Lionel Messi in that tie but the result will still be on their minds. They are not the side of three years ago and have defensive worries. Javier Mascherano is not a good enough defender.

STAR MAN: LIONEL MESSI 

Not at the same level as 2010 but a genius who can destroy anybody.

An accident waiting to happen? Javier Mascherano (left) is a weak link while Lionel Messi is back to his best

Flying the flag: Barcelona fans cheer on their side against Manchester City in the last 16

I said last year they’d win it and I still think they will be the first team to retain it.

They are a team full of stars and they all know their jobs. If any side can trouble them it’s Chelsea. The memory of the 2012 final is there and with Jose and Pep Guardiola in charge, the mind games will begin.

STAR MAN: FRANCK RIBERY

It’s very hard to pick one main man, but Ribery has everything: pace, skill and real star quality.

Making his point: Pep Guardiola (left) can steer Bayern to their sixth European Cup win with the likes of Franck Ribery in the side

Dortmund were so thrilling to watch last year but are not at the same level. They have suffered injuries and lost Mario Gotze to Bayern. But they got to the final last year so have pedigree.

STAR MAN: ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI 

The Pole is a beautiful footballer but with a move in the summer you question his drive.

Black and gold: Borussia Dortmund are 14/1 to win this year's Champions League

Pole star: But Robert Lewandowski will miss the first leg of Dortmund's quarter-final after picking up a booking in the defeat to Zenit

The dark horses this year. PSG have two of the world’s best strikers in Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani, but they are strong in midfield too and Thiago Silva is one of the best defenders around. They were unlucky to lose to Barcelona last year and nobody will want to draw them.

STAR MAN: EDINSON CAVANI

It’s easy to pick out Ibrahimovic, but Cavani is an unsung hero. He has quality and works hard.

Superstar: Zlatan Ibrahimovic has the ability to win matches on his own for Paris Saint-Germain

Strong supporting cast: Edinson Cavani has had an excellent first season in France, netting 18 times in all competitions

They are finding their rhythm at the right time. They have two heavyweights in Bale and Ronaldo but Luka Modric has been an unsung hero. Despite all his trophies, I’ve always felt Sergio Ramos is a bit of a liability at the back. But with those attackers, they are capable of anything.

STAR MAN: CRISTIANO RONALDO 

He is a game changer and the one man you wouldn’t want to come up against as an opponent.

A liability: Sergio Ramos (right) is not the best central defender left in the competition

A force of nature: Cristiano Ronaldo (right) has everything in his locker and will look to bring Real Madrid a first European Cup since 2002
