John Terry's second goal in a week put Chelsea in control as they extended their lead at the top of the Premier League.

Diego Costa scored a sensational second as Jose Mourinho's side dominated against a West Ham team who offered little. 

Sportsmail's Neil Ashton rated the players' performances at Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea's players celebrate after John Terry's header put them in the lead at Stamford Bridge

Chelsea

Thibaut Courtois: Not his busiest afternoon in nets. Commanding presence as ever at defensive set-pieces. 6.5

Branislav Ivanovic: Loved his ‘mouthing’ gesture at Carroll after their clash inside penalty area. It wasn’t a penalty, but he didn’t dive. Would back Carroll in a punch up though - just. 7 

Branislav Ivanovic feels the full force of an Andy Carroll tackle but the Chelsea defence was rarely troubled

Gary Cahill: Clear handball in first half. Big Sam responded by shouting ‘Are you bloody blind?’ at the linesman. Improved throughout. 7

John Terry: Had not scored in previous 37 Premier League games until Stoke. Now has two in two. Captain, leader, etc... 7.5 

Terry celebrates putting his side ahead from close range as West Ham failed to deal with a corner

Cesar Azpilicueta: Especially keen to keep Stewart Downing quiet. Didn’t have much trouble. 7

Cesc Fabregas: Industrious as ever, up there in Toni Kroos territory with more than 140 touches of the ball in the centre of midfield. 7

Nemanja Matic: Usual protective cloak in front of the Chelsea defence. Decent first half strike saved by Adrian. 7.5

Willian: Took it in turns to take direct free-kicks. His went over the bar in the second half. 6.5

Willian, who was a lively member of Chelsea's dangerous attack, skips past Mark Noble

Oscar: Missed early chance over bar, had another well saved by Adrian after the break. Quiet for him. 6.5

Eden Hazard: Usual sweet touches, delicious back-heel in the first half. Hauled down by Reid for booking. 6.5

Diego Costa: Two left feet in front of goal first half, lethal in the second. 7

Subs: Didier Drogba (Costa 82): Hero’s reception, as usual. 6

John Obi Mikel (Oscar 82): Brought on to see this game out. 6

Ramires (Willian 86): A run out, but nothing more than that. 6 

Manager - Jose Mourinho: His eyes are on the prize and they will take some stopping from here. 7 

West Ham

Adrian: Decent saves from Cahill, Willian and Matic in first half. Totally exposed by defence for Terry goal. Good stop from Oscar in second half. 7.5 

West Ham goalkeeper Adrian could do nothing about Diego Costa's excellent strike to make it 2-0

Carl Jenkinson: Got a naughty side to his game, nipped Fabregas’ ankles at the end of first half. 6.5

James Collins: Booked for bringing down Costa in a sweet Chelsea move. Lost Terry for Chelsea opener. 6

Winston Reid: Booked for shoving Hazard to the floor. Sometimes it is the only way to stop this Chelsea team. 6

Aaron Cresswell, Winston Reid and Adrian argue with Ivanovic after the defender went down in the box

Aaron Cresswell: One test of a decent team is whether the full backs can still get forward against the big boys. Neither crossed the halfway line. 6

Kevin Nolan: Would have taken something special to get the better out of Matic out there. 5.5

Kevin Nolan dives into a tackle on Cesc Fabregas as the visitors tried, and failed, to stop the midfielder

Mark Noble: Running the show in the opening spell but disappeared into the rear view mirror when Matic and Fabregas got going. 5.5

Cheikhou Kouyate: Tried to do far too much with the ball when he had Matic for company. Five seconds later Chelsea scored a second. 5

Stewart Downing: Enjoys drifting in from the right and getting the ball on his left foot, but this wasn’t for him. 5.5

Andy Carroll: Usually enjoys a physical battle, but Cahill won this one hands down. Can’t be happy about that. Substituted. 5

Andy Carroll, who cut a lonely figure up front for West Ham, holds off Fabregas at Stamford Bridge

Enner Valencia: Struggled to make an impression, smothered every time he was in possession. This day belonged to Chelsea’s defence.

Subs: Diafra Sakho (Carroll 59): No impact. 5.5

Alex Song (Noble 59): Perhaps he should have started. 6

Morgan Amalfitano (Downing 74): Hit post with 86th minute effort. Unlucky. 6

Manager - Sam Allardyce: Leaving Sakho and Song out of the team felt like he had one eye on the Arsenal game. 5
