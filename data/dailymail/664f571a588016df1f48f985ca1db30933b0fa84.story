Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of FA Cup fixtures, as well as intriguing statistics from the Football League...

1. Theo Walcott’s hopes of being used as a central striker are being damaged by the sensational scoring form of Olivier Giroud.

When Walcott signed his new £100,000 a week contract a year ago it was on the promise of playing in his favourite role – he’d just made his case by getting five goals in as many games after being moved from the wings.

Walcott had come off the bench to replace Danny Welbeck, but has not completed 90 minutes this season

Fast forward and Walcott has yet to play 90 minutes since recovering from injury, while Giroud has seven goals from his last nine games and Danny Welbeck is also competing for the same position.

It didn’t help Walcott’s case that his one big opportunity to get on the score sheet against Middlesbrough saw him denied by a brilliant Tomas Mejias save.

2. Sam Allardyce blamed West Ham’s miserable showing at West Brom on fatigue after his squad had played three games in six days.

Nine of the Hammers starting line-up for the 4-0 drubbing at The Hawthorns had been involved in all of the fixtures, including making a trip to Southampton that according to Google Maps is 120 miles away.

You’d have some sympathy with him – except ten of the side that Tony Pulis picked had also been involved in three games in six days. Mind you their away game, at Burnley, was only 119 miles away.

Under-fire Sam Allardyce blamed heavy legs for West Ham's cup exit, but West Brom had played just as much

3. Tom Cleverley has had his critics at both Manchester United and Aston Villa for passing square or backwards – but working for Tim Sherwood might just help him rediscover the spark that got him into the England squad back when Sir Alex Ferguson was his gaffer.

Tom Cleverley has played just 29 per cent of passes forward this season, but should improve under Sherwood

In 22 appearances for Villa this season the 25-year-old had hit barely 29 per cent of 880 passes forwards.

But after new boss Sherwood went into the dressing room at half time against Leicester to give his first talk, Cleverley was transformed. In all he hit 28 out of 42 passes forward in the 2-1 FA Cup win – a total of 66 per cent.

4. Maybe it was the poor pitch, maybe it was the way Phil Parkinson’s Bradford snapped into tackles, but Sunderland’s performance at Valley Parade was abysmal.

Most Premier League players achieve passing accuracy figures of at least 80 per cent in most games, with many registering scores in the 90s.

Liam Bridcutt's 19.3 per cent pass completion was the best Sunderland can manage in a shocking showing

But not one of Gus Poyet’s team that became the League One side’s latest victims found a team mate with more than Liam Bridcutt’s meagre 59.3 per cent of passes.

Midfielders Adam Johnson and Sebastian Larsson both gave it away 16 times out of the 32 attempts to pass the ball.

5. Simon Mignolet has recovered from the mini confidence crisis that saw him taken out of the firing line by Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers.

Simon Mignolet, who has conceded just four goals in nine games, comes to punch against Crystal Palace

Fraizer Campbell’s early goal for Crystal Palace was only the fourth the 26-year-old Belgian has conceded in his last nine games – and the faith that Rodgers now has in him is shown by the fact he’s getting picked for Cup ties as well as Premier League games.

Mignolet made three good saves to protect Liverpool’s 2-1 win, and also made half a dozen catches.

6. Things are not going so well, though, for Jack Butland who faces the rest of the season sat on the bench behind Asmir Begovic at Stoke.

The 21-year-old who was a surprise late call-up for Roy Hodgson’s Euro 2012 squad had been told by boss Mark Hughes he would play in Cup games and should use them to challenge for the number one Premier League spot.

Jack Butland conceded four times against Blackburn, and may now have limited opportunities this season

But the 4-1 defeat to Championship Blackburn leaves Butland, who spent the first part of the season out on loan at Derby to get game time, facing the fact he’ll get few more opportunities this season.

7. Jordan Ibe’s return to Liverpool after half a season polishing up his act under Steve McClaren’s guidance at Derby has given an opportunity to another bright young star to step up.

McClaren has filled the place in his promotion chasing squad by taking Manchester United’s equally precocious Jesse Lingard on loan.

The 22-year-old, just recovered from the knee injury he suffered making his United debut against Swansea in August, was the pick of Derby’s players in their 2-1 defeat by Reading.

8. Fulham owner Shahid Khan might be considering reforming his “managerial search committee” as his club’s miserable season takes another turn for the worse.

Khan tasked a five-man committee that included former players Brian McBride, Danny Murphy and Niall Quinn to head hunt a replacement for Felix Magath when the German was sacked in September.

Kit Symons made a great start with Fulham, but their form has begun to slip in recent weeks

In the event they never needed to deliver their report as Kit Symons won five games out of seven to land the job.

Since then the 43-year-old former Academy chief has not found life so simple – the 2-1 home defeat by Ipswich made it just two wins from his last 13 games.

9. Nearly 15 years since the infamous Old Trafford match when he was chased by Roy Keane and a possee of Manchester United players, referee Andy D’ Urso is still causing controversy.

The 51-year-old steadfastly refused to hang up his whistle despite getting relegated from the elite list in 2005.

Walsall boss Dean Smith slammed him for failing to give a penalty and a red card when Jordy Hiwula appeared to be pulled back by Ryan Inniss as the Saddlers lost 1-0 at home to Port Vale.

10. Charlton teenager Tareiq Holmes-Dennis has made a dramatic difference to Plymouth since joining John Sheridan’s League Two team on loan.

The West Country club had gone seven games without a win before the 19-year-old was recalled from a loan spell with Oxford and then sent to sign at Home Park.

The 2-0 win over Cambridge made it three wins in a row without conceding a goal, and pushed Sheridan’s team back into the League Two play-off places.
