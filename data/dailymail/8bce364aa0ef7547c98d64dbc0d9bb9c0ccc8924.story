Daughter of rock legend Mick Jagger and supermodel Jerry Hall, Lizzy Jagger is the face of the new Skiny campaign - her second season with the cult Austrian intimates brand.

American Lizzy, 28, joins a host of international supermodels who have also fronted Skiny campaigns through its 26 year history, including Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Laetitia Casta.

Showcasing underwear and loungewear, 
Lizzie shot the campaign in South Africa and the whole of the collection
 is based around the Out of Africa/safari vibe, under the tag line 'Who 
Scares?' 

Lizzy rides a zebra wearing an African headdress and the Skiny Cotton Express set, £22 bar and £8 knickers

She modelled from Playboy in 2011 and just a few months ago got naked with a fish to highlight unsustainable fishing.

But the model hasn't been pushed to her limits yet.

The ‘Who Scares?’ campaign sees Lizzy and her fellow models riding zebras, fearlessly facing rhinos and bumping along dirt tracks in a four wheel drive.

The Skiny brand labels itself as 'playful and fresh' and 'with a great sense of fun'.  The underwear is made of cotton with statement prints, basic colours and bold brights.

The brand values good shaping and incorporate 'smooth, seamless and shapely designs' for 'the ultimate T shirt bras'.

Seductive: Lizzy poses as an Eastern princess in the Spring Blossom set, £20 bra and £11 knickers

Wild: The Jagger girl is super svelte with leopards wearing the Nostalgia £23 bra and £12 knickers

Lizzy poses casually in a Jeep-type vehicle with tumbling curls falling over her shoulder while wearing the French Bouquet set, £25 for the bra and £12 for the knickers

They also incorporate loungewear into the collection, reworking cotton basics with new prints and bold colourways.

Talking about the brand and products, Lizzy said: 'It's just my kind of underwear - pretty, sexy, comfortable, versatile and well made. 

'Also Skiny uses a lot of natural fabrics, which is important to me.' 

Loungewear: Lizzy's a bit more covered up while modeling the orange Cotton Express lingerie, £20 bra, £8 knickers, the Lounge Appeal hoodie £40 and bottoms £32

Regarding her friends and family's reactions to the pictures, Lizzy said: 'My friends, my sister Georgia and my mum think they are really cheeky.' 

Skiny is available on Amazon and swimwear will be launching later in the year.

Two's company: Lizzy is joined by a fit male model as she wears the French Bouquet Skiny set again

Men can get in on the action too with the Flashy Option Modal brief £15 and shirt £24
