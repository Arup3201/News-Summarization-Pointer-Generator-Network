A cat who was found with a 27-inch arrow shot through his abdomen has survived after undergoing life-saving emergency surgery.

A woman discovered the bleeding animal in a field in Waterville, New York 10 days ago and rushed him to Waterville Veterinary Clinic with the projectile still lodged in his side.

The weapon had entered the cat's right side between two ribs before exiting from the left side of his body just behind his ribs - lacerating his liver, stomach and spleen.

James Gilchrist, the managing veterinarian at clinic, said he and his team rushed the feline into surgery for the first of two operations.

Cat-astrophe: In a photo taken August 22, the cat can be seen with a 27-inch arrow in its abdomen. The animal was found in a field and taken to a veterinarian clinic, where it underwent two operations

But Gilchrist shared the good news with the Utica Observer-Dispatch in an email.

'Two hours of surgery later followed by another surgery four days later, he is finally going to make it!!!' he wrote.

It was initially reported that the cat has been adopted by a clinic employee and would go to his new home on Thursday, but a family also reached out to the clinic to ask if it was their pet, who went missing last month. Staff are looking into the call.

It was suggested that the cat should be called Robin Hood or Arrow but the employee adopting the animal did not want a name reflecting the injury and he has temporarily been named Norman.

Before he leaves the clinic, he will have his stitches removed but he is otherwise well.

Feline much better: The cat, who has been named Norman, is now recovering after the surgeries

Missing death by a whisker: Police are investigating who shot the cat, who is expected to go home on Thursday

Law enforcement have been notified and officers are investigating who shot the cat, Gilchrist said.

Just two weeks ago, a ginger tabby cat named Ninja was sitting outside his family's trailer in Montana when he was shot with an arrow. The projectile pierced his ear and came out the back of his neck.

Ninja ran away, but returned that night without the arrow. His family was stunned to discover that the feline had somehow managed to remove the arrow.

The cat was taken to a local veterinarian to be treated for his injuries and is expected to make a full recovery, even though he still has a hole in his ear and neck.
