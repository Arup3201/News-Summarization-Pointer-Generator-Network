At 56, Madonna sent shock waves across the red carpet at last night's Grammy Awards with her OTT cleavage and fishnet stockings.

But not all the mature red carpet guests were choose to flash the flesh yesterday evening - over here in London, the ladies at the BAFTAs enjoyed a more sophisticated approach to mature dressing.

Julianne Moore, Imelda Staunton and national treasure Julie Walters were among the women over 50 who wowed at last night's event.

Julie Walters lead the way for the over-50s in a dazzling floor-length sequin dress. The dress from Adrianna Papell came in at just £330, a snip for a red carpet show-stopper

Although they opted for an air of sophistication, the women showed that they were no means wallflowers, opting for show stopping ballgowns and bold colours. 

One outfit that was sure to grab the paparazzi's attention was the bold choice of Julie Walters, who graced the red carpet in a floor-length sequin dress.

The 64-year-old proved that sequins can be worn at any age as she dazzled in a glittering dress by Adrianna Papell.  

The actress who presented the Outstanding British Contribution Award to cinema to Christine Langan for BBC Films, matched the dress, which cost just £330, with silver court shoes and added an air of elegance to her look with a pretty black shawl worn over her shoulders.

Imelda Staunton, 59, was joined on the red carpet by her husband Jim Carter who looked rather dapper in black tie.

The Harry Potter star dazzled in a full-skirted ball gown and took away a BAFTA for supporting actress for her role in the British film Pride. 

As well as British beauties taking the crown for over 50s-dressing, several overseas actresses also provided some lessons in mature style. 

Imelda Satunton, 59, was accompanied by husband Jim Carter, but refused to be outdone, catching everyone's eye in an emerald green, full-skirted ball gown 

American actress Julianne Moore, 54, demonstrated that you can steal the show at any age by wearing a floor-length red dress.

The actress who took home a BAFTA for Best Actress for her role in Still Alice, complemented her fiery red hair with an equally fiery ensemble from Tom Ford.

The top half of the dress, which boasted a halterneck at the top of a sheer panel, was made from velvet, with the sleek floor-length skirt making the most of Julianne's trim shape.

The skirt was also split at the front, showing off a killer pair of black strappy heels.

Monica Bellucci showed that glamour has no age restrictions in a figure-hugging black floor-length gown.

Monica was recently revealed as the latest Bond girl and will star in the new 007 flick Spectre. 

At 50 she will be the oldest femme fatale of the movie series to date and last night she proved she was most-deserving of the part.

The Italian actress looked the epitome of vintage elegance in her sleek, simple and effective dress, which hugged her slender shape in all the right places.

Her eye-catching garment was complete with long sleeves and flared cuffs - a shape which was replicated down the skirt.

Dame Kristin  Scott Thomas, 54, had the enviable task of presenting heart-throb Eddie Redmayne with his BAFTA for leading actor. 

But some may argue that Eddie was the lucky one as Kristin presented the picture of elegance.

The actress showcased her enviable figure in a floor sweeping dress with a fish tail hem and completed the look with a pair of dazzling diamond earrings and a clutch bag. 

Fashion writer Simon Glazin says that unlike their younger counterparts, women in their 50s tend to be more honest about their personal style and rely less on stylists.

Simon says: 'I love seeing women over 50 on the red carpets because what you see really is their true style.

'The younger stars are very much led by stylists, designers befriending them for one reason, and pushy PRs throwing dresses at them, sometimes in exchange for money.

'But it's only when you reach a certain age that you become comfortable in your skin, and are not 'trend' led.'

Simon added that none of the actresses had been held back their age and says that they could teach people a thing or two about red carpet style. 

Dress for your body shape: Highlight the body parts you are happy with (an interesting neckline, straps if you have good shoulders, ruched at the waist to draw the eye in to the smallest part).

Colour is key too: Play up to pale in a standout colour, or just chose black for a bit of chic. And sparkles can be a women's best friend.

And finally: Nobody, apart from Madonna, wants to look like mutton dressed as lamb. You'll get all the wrong press!

'Julianne Moore, one of the best dressers on any red carpet, was the star of the BAFTAs. 

'Red on a redhead is a great move, and Tom Ford obviously knows how to dress women.

'Julie Waters was a walking masterclass at how to dress at a certain age: long sleeves, long length and a scoop neckline. 

'Her glittered gown was perfect on her, also showing off her fantastic figure.

'Kristin Scott Thomas turned on the vamp in plain black. Cinched in at the waist, long sleeves again, and a plunge at the cleavage. Very understated glamour!

'And Imelda Staunton, one of our finest actresses, had fun with her emerald green ball gown. It was slightly too mother-of-the-bride, but she definitely owned it, and clearly loved her frock.'
