Health Minister Norman Lamb has warned Tory cuts could cost lives

Planned Tory spending cuts will have 'very serious consequences' for the old and frail – and could even cost lives, a Lib Dem minister has warned.

Health Minister Norman Lamb said Conservative plans to slash the deficit without increasing taxes meant it was 'inevitable' that care for the elderly would be drastically hit.

He said old-age care was already facing huge pressures, but Mr Cameron's decision to protect school funding as well as health and overseas aid meant the impact was now going to be 'massive'.

This will mean 'unacceptable standards of care' which could cost lives, he said.

Mr Lamb told MailOnline: 'Now they've said schools are going to be ring-fenced, the proportionate impact on other areas is going to be even greater.

'I'm quite sure they won't be ring-fencing councils [which control social care spending] against deficit reduction and so the impact on services for frail elderly people could be massive and the knock on effect for the NHS could be significant as well.'

He went on: 'If you are going to cut that further, and as far as I can see that's inevitable under the Tories' plans, the consequences for older people are very serious.'

Asked if it would put their lives at risk he said: 'Of course, potentially that is the case, but also just unacceptable standards of care.

'If they want to solve that by transferring money from the NHS budget, then it means they are not ring-fencing the NHS.'

Mr Lamb added: 'That's why I have made this call, where I'm saying all of us, all parties should come together for a non-partisan review this year, which would engage the public in a debate on both the care and health budgets.'

The Lib Dem minister said he wanted the party's manifesto to include a commitment to transfer the old-age care budget from the department for local government to a new 'Department for Health and Care'.

George Osborne last year set out plans for another £55billion of spending cuts in a bid to eliminate the deficit and run up a £23billion budget surplus in 2019/20.

Independent economic experts said Government departments like the Home Office, which controls the police, and the Department for Local Government, which overseas old-age care, will have slashed if Mr Osborne is to hit his target.

David Cameron yesterday pledged to freeze spending on education per pupil in England in the next Parliament

Welfare cuts or tax rises worth about £21 billion a year would be needed by 2019/20 - at a time when Conservatives are committed to income tax cuts worth £7 billion.

Mr Lamb's warning comes amid growing pressures on the NHS – amid an unprecedented squeeze on its finances and increasing demand for treatment at A&E.

NHS boss Simon Stevens has called for another £8billion a year to be funnelled into the health budget by 2020.
