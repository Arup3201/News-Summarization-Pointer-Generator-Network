One day Roger Federer will stop writing tennis history but, at 33, there is absolutely no sign of it yet.

His huge list of tennis achievements already reads like some kind of biblical scroll lengthwise, and on Sunday he helped Switzerland to win the Davis Cup title for the first time by defeating France 3-1 before a world record crowd.

Of course it had to be Federer himself to strike the winning blow, finding himself charged with clinching the 114 year-old Cup when walking out to face Richard Gasquet amid the feverish atmosphere of the Stade Pierrer Mauroy.

He duly did so with a minimum of fuss, dispatching the Frenchman – a late substitute for Jo Wilfried Tsonga – 6-4 6-2 6-2 to put the outcome beyond any doubt.

To 17 Grand Slams, 302 weeks as world number one, an Olympic gold medal (in doubles, but let us not split hairs), winning every different Slam and a multitude of other things add the sport's premier team competition, claimed this year in the company of Stan Wawrinka.

It was only this time last week that the scale of the two players' argument at the Barclays ATP World Finals in London was becoming apparent, after the calling out from courtside of his wife Mirka during their Saturday semi-final.

Seven days and one repaired back on from there he was in scintillating form, taking the pivotal doubles point on Saturday and then finishing the job off in solo combat against the unfortunate Gasquet.

If anything was going to galvanise Federer it was his highly polished status taking something of a knock from the events of the previous weekend. He disappointed fans at the 02 Arena when pulling out of the final and then got caught up in the fallout from his argument with his old friend/rival/team-mate.

Mirka was not there to witness this redemption, having stayed back at home in Switzerland to avoid any distraction.

On Friday he had looked somewhat immobile in being hit off the court by Gael Monfils, although by the end of that match he was moving better, a trend that continued in the doubles and inexorably on Sunday.

The Swiss star, who had won everything in the sport bar the Davis cup before this, completed the trophy set

The Swiss World No 2 was back to his imperious best after a difficult Friday to swat away Gasquet

'Not for me, this is for the boys. I have won enough in my career that I don't need this to complete my everything – ticking off the boxes. We put in so much hard work. I am happy I was able to stay calm and play a good match,' he said in the emotional aftermath.

We may never know how bad his back really was, and it was certainly transformed from the final's opening day, which increasingly looks like it was a practice session for the second two matches he was to play. Andy Murray mischievously tweeted afterwards: 'Amazing how long a couple of days is in sport…'

It seemed Wawrinka thought the same. As the Swiss celebrations got into full swing the Swiss No 2 later joked 'Roger I still love you'.

Whatever, Federer clearly trusted his back completely against a player he knows he should beat, having amassed at 12-2 career record against the talented but introverted Gasquet, who is not known as the fiercest competitor.

It was not entirely clear why Gasquet was promoted over Tsonga to try and keep the final alive. Conflicting accounts from the French team and their officials had him being plain dropped or nursing an injured elbow.

But in truth, neither he nor Gasquet would have been expected to beat Federer in fully restored fitness and on this form, with the Swiss having ended the season as the world number two by force of results rather than any accident.

His mountain of big match experience was bound to serve him well in the bear pit atmosphere that greeted him, with his every shot in the warm-up greeted with a boo. 

Federer was stretched occasionally, but he had more than enough to see off Gasquet and secure the win

Once it got going he always looked the winner, by virtue of him doing the same things as Gasquet does but a bit better, aided by the fact that he remains quicker around the court than the man five years his junior.

He broke for 4-2 in the first set, and broke twice more to forge ahead to 5-2 in the second set. British umpire James Keothavong had his work cut out controlling the excitable French Captain Arnaud Clement, who protested about several line calls, but Federer remained serene.

Another couple of breaks saw him serve out for the match and he finished it in glorious style with an exquisite drop shot, before falling onto the clay face forward and being hugged by his team-mates.

Federer looked overcome by emotion at the end, after this rare new new experience for him. He is a remarkable athlete for our times. 

Having drunk some champagne with his teammates Federer later said 'On Monday or Tuesday I thought there was no way I could play three days this weekend, it was after Friday's match I felt more confident.'

He would not commit to whether or not he would help defend the title next year.
