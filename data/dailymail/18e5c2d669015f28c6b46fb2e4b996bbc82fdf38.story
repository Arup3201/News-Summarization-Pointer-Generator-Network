Mass killer Thomas Hamilton, who shot dead 16 schoolchildren and their teacher at Dunblane, central Scotland

Today's shooting that left dozens dead at an elementary school in Connecticut brings back chilling memories of Britain's worst school massace, Dunblane.

Sixteen children and their teacher, Gwen Mayor, were killed on March 13, 1996 when misfit loner Thomas Hamilton burst into Dunblane Primary School gym and opened fire.

The former Scout leader fired at random in the school's gym before turning the gun on himself.

The world looked on in horror as details of the bloody massacre in Scotland unfolded.

Andy Murray, the British tennis player, was a pupil at the Dunblane 
school at the time of the shootings.

He has described hiding under the 
table in his classroom during the attack.

It
prompted outrage from around the world, including from the Queen and 
then Prime Minister John Major, who called it a 'sick and evil act'.

'I
find it difficult to express the feelings I know will be felt 
throughout Dunblane,' said the Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, who 
represented Dunblane.

'This
is a close-knit community where everyone knows everyone else and the 
impact of this horrible tragedy will be felt in every household.'

The subsequent public inquiry 
revealed that Hamilton had licenses for six guns and had previously been
investigated by local police for inappropriate behavior around young 
boys.

Among other transgressions, while 
serving as a scout leader, Hamilton reportedly took photos of semi-naked
boys without their parents' permission.

The year after the massacre Tony Blair 
introduced the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 which banned the remaining 
handguns in England, Scotland and Wales, and left only some historic and
sporting handguns legal.

Like in the UK, today's shooting in 
Connecticut is likely to reignite the debate surrounding the purchase of
firearms in the U.S..

At least 27 people are feared dead 
after a masked gunman opened fire inside the Sandy Hook Elementary 
School in Newton, Connecticut today.

On March 13, 1996, Thomas Hamilton walked into Dunblane Primary School in Scotland and shot 16 children and their teacher dead before turning the gun on himself

In July US president Barack Obama 
called for tougher background checks on Americans trying to buy a gun in
the wake of the Batman theatre shootings in Colorado.

He also called for restrictions to 
keep mentally unbalanced individuals from buying weapons.

Those steps 
'shouldn't be controversial, they should be common sense', he said.

Armed police and ambulances on the streets of Hungerford after Michael Ryan shot 16 people dead in 1987

Twelve people were confirmed dead and three were fighting for their lives two years ago after a taxi driver went on the rampage in the UK's worst shooting incident since the Dunblane massacre

Dunblane was one of three major 
mass-shootings in modern British history, after the tragedy of 
Hungerford and before a second school massacre in the Lake District in Cumbria two years ago.

On August 19 1987, Michael Ryan 
killed 14 people, including his mother, and injured 15 others in the 
small Berkshire town of Hungerford.

The 27-year-old unemployed labourer 
and antiques dealer went on the rampage as he drove around the town. He 
shot picnickers, a man mowing his lawn and a couple sitting in their 
back garden.

A police chase ended with Ryan 
barricading himself into a classroom at his old school, the John O'Gaunt
Community College, where he shot himself.

The most recent UK mass-shooting was in Cumbria, when 12 people were shot by a cab driver who went on a bloody rampage in the Lake District before turning the gun on himself.

Derrick Bird, a divorced father-of-two, was discovered in woodland near Boot, Cumbria, by police.

In 1990 polls showed that a substantial majority of Americans, nearly 80 per cent, supported stricter limits on guns.

Now Americans appear evenly divided between those who want tougher restrictions and those who want to stick with current laws.

Gun rights groups are a powerful lobby in the United States, where easy access to guns is a way of life in many of the more conservative and rural areas.

The right to bear arms is guaranteed by the US constitution, alongside such basic rights as free speech and freedom of religion.

In a speech to the National Urban League civil rights group, Mr Obama said he wanted a national consensus in the effort to stem gun violence.

Despite the Second Amendment's protection of gun rights, Mr Obama said: 'I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that an AK-47 belongs in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals - that they belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities.'

Gun control is a highly partisan issue in the U.S.. The powerful National Rifle Association, which fights gun control and has huge sway in Congress, has successfully made the issue nearly off limits among most legislators who fear the group's opposition at re-election time.

Republican challenger Mitt Romney said in a television interview that changing the nation's laws would not prevent gun-related tragedies.

He mistakenly said many weapons used by the suspect in the Colorado shooting were obtained illegally. Authorities say the firearms used to kill 12 people and injure dozens were purchased legally.
