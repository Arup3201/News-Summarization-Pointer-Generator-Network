The first thought of many a man eager to bring a smile to the face of the woman in his life would be to present her with a box of chocolates.

But in 1933 chocolate assortments were the preserve of the rich - sold encased in elaborate hand-carved boxes and costing the equivalent of up to £300 in today's money.

That is until Rowntree's launched its now iconic Black Magic brand, bringing all the luxury and indulgence of a box of chocolates to the masses for a mere 14p in old currency - and saving the ailing confectioner in the process.

Bringing chocolate boxes to the masses: Rowntree's advertising campaign for its Black Magic chocolates - including this 1934 poster - featured young society ladies

Launched in 1933 as Rowntree's was on the brink of bankruptcy, these archive posters - released to mark Black Magic's 80th anniversary - reveal the groundbreaking advertising campaign employed by the firm as it gambled its future on the budget box of chocolates.

The adverts featured glamorous ladies and excerpts from their effusive thank you letters written to the sender of the gift, then priced at two shillings and ten pence per lb - around £5 in modern money.

Those thank you letters, which continued to feature in Black Magic adverts for decades to come, became almost as iconic a part of the brand as the simple, no-frills black box.

The hit brand was the brainchild of 
marketing man George Harris, who began working for Rowntree's after 
marrying into the family.

Lucky recipients of box of Black Magic in the 1930s could take their pick from orange fondant, hazelnut cluster, montelimar, or cherry cup - not forgetting classic dark chocolates with marzipan, strawberry or caramel fillings.

Fast-forward to 2013, and the orange fondant and caramel treats remain, alongside 'reinvented classics' like almond crunch - finely chopped almonds and truffle encased in dark chocolate - dreamy fudge, and a whole hazelnut praline in a dark chocolate shell.

He
spearheaded the first ever market research carried out by the 
confectioner, interviewing 9,500 people before deciding which flavours 
should be included in the dark chocolate assortment.

Only
then did the manufacturer settle on the popular combination 
incorporating orange fondant, hazelnut cluster, and marzipan, caramel 
and strawberry fillings.

Alex
Hutchinson, archive curator at Nestle, which took over Rowntree's in 1988, 
said: 'The Rowntree's business had been through shaky times before Black 
Magic was invented.

'In
1921 the business made a 33 per cent loss and in the late 1920s it was 
still struggling and they had to lay a lot of people off.

'In 1931 Rowntree's was worried they wouldn’t be able to pay out any dividends to their shareholders.

'George Harris married into the family and started working for Rowntree's and he came up with the idea that their chocolates should have their own strong brands like America.

'People were suspicious of the idea but created Black Magic, which was quite a gamble as it could have been their last chocolate.

'Before then, whatever went into a box of chocolates was decided on by the directors of the business. It was the first time they had actually done market research.

'Up until this point most boxes of chocolates were incredibly expensive and were the kind of thing used when making a marriage proposal,' Mr Hutchinson explained.

Who knows the secret? By the 1980s Black Magic were a popular and affordable gift, but prior to their launch in the 1930s boxes of chocolates were extremely expensive

'They would come in hand carved boxes that could cost around 100 shillings each, which was an awful lot considering a week’s rent in slums was 10 shillings,' he added.

'Initially they couldn’t afford to spend a lot on advertising Black Magic so the sales people sold the boxes to hotels in London before taking them to shops.

'Shopkeepers bought them up quickly when they were told this because they thought they were getting a posh product, the money was then spent on advertising.'

'In the adverts there are young society ladies confiding in one another in letters about receiving Black Magic.

'It was to encourage people to see that buying a box of chocolates was okay to do as part of an early courtship,' said Mr Hutchinson, adding that, before then, the expense of a box of chocolates meant such a gift was reserved for as rare an occasion as a marriage proposal.

'After the success of Black Magic, George Harris made other iconic brands such as Kit Kat, Aero, Smarties, Polo, and Dairy Box and the company was able to expand.'
