This is the dramatic moment that a young woman who said she was going to kill herself after a row with her family almost ended up carrying out the threat when she slipped off the balcony, and ended up hanging 11 floors above the street.

Shuang Tsou, 23, tried to kill herself by hanging out of a window in Chengdu city in southwest China's Sichuan province.

The drama started when she was heard having a furious row with her family and shouted that she'd had enough and was going to end it all.

Deadly: Shuang Tsou, 23, slipped off the balcony and ended up hanging 11 floors above the street where a neighbour held onto her

The woman's father said that the family had not believed her and told her not to be stupid whilst they carried on watching television.

But after she climbed onto the balcony in a dramatic gesture the young woman slipped.

According to neighbour Xu XXX, living on the 11th floor and just below the family of the young woman, he had heard shouting that seemed to be from the balcony above, and had gone out to look.

He said: 'I couldn't believe it, she had clearly slipped from the balcony above but had somehow managed to either grab onto my guardrail or had got her feet stuck.

'Either way she was hanging upside down by her feet and threatened to slip onto the street below at any moment. I grabbed hold of her feet and held on.'

Fireman were quickly on the scene and were able to reach the young woman by clambering over the front of the balconies, and then helping her back up to the flat she had fallen from because there was a metal grill over Mr Xu's flat that prevented entry.

The dramatic scenes of the last moment of the rescue were snapped by a person on the street below who uploaded them onto social media sites where the fireman won praise for his bravery in clambering out of the window, despite the risk to his own life.
