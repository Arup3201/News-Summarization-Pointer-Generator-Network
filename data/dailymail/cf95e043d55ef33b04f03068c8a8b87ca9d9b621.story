Germany's World Cup support network spread across the globe - from the stands at the Maracana to Silverstone - as they conquered France 1-0 in their quarter-final on Friday.

Bastian Schweinsteiger's better half Sarah Brandner's beaming grin in the crowd at the Rio de Janeiro stadium told the story of their triumph as they set up a semi-final meeting with Brazil or Colombia.

She and the rest of Germany's travelling faithful will be hoping this won't be their team's last appearance at the venue, with the final to be held there on July 13.

Meanwhile, Nico 
Rosberg will be hoping the win is the start of a big weekend for his country as he 
looks to claim another Formula One victory in the British Grand Prix.

The
 leader of the driver's championship was in a race of a different kind 
after Friday's second practice session as he hurried through the 
Silverstone complex to make a screening of the match in Rio de Janeiro.

Proudly
 clad in Germany's home shirt, MailOnline Sport columnist Rosberg got 
his wish when a Mats Hummels header was enough to send Les Bleus 
packing.

'Yes!
 Great match boys! Now everything is possible. Congrats from 
Silverstone,' he posted on Twitter with a picture of him celebrating out
 of his seat.

Rosberg couldn't help himself in giving 
Lotus's French driver Romain Grosjean a little kick in his post either, posting 'Sorry @RGrsojean'.Â 

Rosberg leads his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton by 
29 points and was two tenths of a second shy of the Brit's fastest lap of the day - 1min 
34.508secs - as they wound up for Saturday's qualifying.

Hamilton's 
day ended early though as he suffered an oil-pressure problem and was forced to stop on turn four with 30 minutes of the session remaining.

Rosberg's fortune on Friday wasn't restricted to the action in Brazil as the German escaped 
punishment for passing Daniil Kvyat's Toro Rosso under red flags. He was called to see the stewards, but they opted to take no further action.
