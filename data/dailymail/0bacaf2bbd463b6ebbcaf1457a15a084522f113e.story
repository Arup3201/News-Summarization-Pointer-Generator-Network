The livery design, created by Chinese fashion designer Masha Ma, features a bamboo and a rose in an eye-catching blend of east-meets-west.

It took an engineering team over 2472 hours, using 186 individuals to complete. 

'Bamboo and roses have significant cultural connotations in China and Britain respectively, and are each cherished symbols,' said Ma, who studied at Central Saint Martins art college in London.

'In Chinese culture, bamboo represents modesty, integrity and vitality. For Britain, the rose symbolises love, nobility and dignity,' she said.

'As Sino-British ties continue to bloom and flourish, I felt that the meeting of bamboo with a rose would be the perfect way to celebrate the growing friendship and collaboration between the two countries.'

Richard Tams, British Airways executive vice president in China, said: 'We are delighted to have the opportunity to work with Masha on such an iconic project . 

'Her inspiring design delivers a strong message: that of a growing and flourishing relationship between the cultures of Britain and China.

The festival, which ran from March 2 to 4, is part of the GREAT Britain campaign aimed at promoting the UK as a world-class destination for trade, tourism, investment and education to generate jobs and growth.
