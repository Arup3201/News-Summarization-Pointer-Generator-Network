Rory McIlroy dumped Caroline Wozniacki in a three-minute phone call hours after telling her he loved her, reports claim.

The Northern Irish golfer and his 23-year-old fiancée were due to wed in November.

But McIlroy, 25, is said to have ended their three-year relationship in 180 seconds because he was not prepared for 'all that marriage entails'.

Engaged: The couple had been together for three years and were due to marry in November

Wozniacki, who crashed out of the French Open on Tuesday, dispelled any suggestions that the break-up was ‘mutual’ at a press conference after the match.

'Obviously you’re not prepared for something like this, and it came as a bit of a shock,' the Dane said.

Her words came a day after McIlroy won won the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, Surrey, in what commentators described as an 'absolute masterclass' and 'incredible stuff'.

According to The Times's Neil Harman, she had no idea their relationship was troubled when McIlroy flew from their apartment in Monaco to play in Surrey.

But a day later, he called to say he couldn't go through with the wedding, Harman writes.

Wozniacki had reportedly already tried on her wedding dress.

The pair, pictured in Sloane Square on May 15, were 'together in their apartment a day before his call'

'The problem is mine,' he said. 'The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready.

'I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had. Everyone has been through break-ups and it's obviously very, very difficult.'

At Wentworth, McIlroy responded by scoring an impressive 14-under total of 274 at the European Tour's flagship event, beating 16 golfers in the top 50 of the world rankings.

Wozniacki lost her match 7-6, 4-6, 6-2 to Belgian player Yanina Wickmayer.
