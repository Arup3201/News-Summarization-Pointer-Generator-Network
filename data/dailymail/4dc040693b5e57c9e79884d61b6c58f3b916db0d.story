Aston Villa boss Paul Lambert has challenged Fabian Delph to become a part of England's new era after labelling midfield duo Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard irreplaceable.

The manager also revealed he will hold talks with the 24-year-old midfielder over his future after his first international call-up.

Delph is in the England squad for the friendly against Norway and the Euro 2016 qualifier with Switzerland next month.

It follows the retirement of Gerrard and Lampard, who won a combined 220 caps for their country.

Michael Carrick and Adam Lallana are also injured, leaving Delph to plug the gap in midfield for the Three Lions.

And Lambert insisted former Under-21 international Delph must not be held back by expectation after the exit of Lampard and Gerrard.

'Whoever follows those two lads - I don't think you ever replace those two brilliant footballers,' he said.

'No two players are the same, it's a new generation, a new time for England.

'You have got to have players coming through to hit those heights.

'Maybe England never won anything with them but they were top players. To fill that is a big ask for anyone.

'Comparisons are unfair because the two made over 200 appearances for England. It is a new generation, hopefully he will do well and stay in that squad.

'I hope he can handle it. If he goes in and feels overawed it will be hard for him. But he's earned the right to be there so everyone thinks good enough, now it is up to him to go and show what he can do.

'If you can't handle it in football it can hurt you mentally.'

Delph only has a year left on his contract at Villa Park, with any deals put on hold over the summer while the club searched for a new owner.

Lambert has also been linked with Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley as he targets signings before Monday's transfer deadline.

But he will talk with Delph, who joined Villa from Leeds for £6million in 2009, about his own future.

'As soon as you are getting picked for England things escalate, so we will have to sit and see what he thinks himself,' he said, ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League visit of Hull.

'This has been thrown at him. England will be first and foremost on his mind.

'The way Fabian is his contract won't enter his head at the moment, he's playing well.'
