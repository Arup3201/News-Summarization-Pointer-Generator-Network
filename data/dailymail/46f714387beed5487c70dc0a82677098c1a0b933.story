Alex McCarthy has no regrets about choosing Barclays Premier League basement boys QPR over Champions League club Liverpool.

The Reds  inflicted a last-gasp defeat on QPR last Sunday as McCarthy made his debut and Rangers endured a challenging week as a result of manager Harry Redknapp's public spat with Adel Taarabt over the playmaker's weight.

Despite the week's events, McCarthy, who signed from Reading in August, insisted he is happy at Loftus Road as he prepared for Monday's Premier League clash with Aston Villa.

Brendan Rodgers and Harry Redknapp battled it out to sign the 24-year-old shot stopper during the summer 

'I don't regret the decision I have made up to now,' said the 24-year-old, who worked under Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers when the pair were at Reading.

'Harry was a big part of me coming here. The things he said to me swayed my decision.

'I spoke to both managers and everything the gaffer here said to me I liked, and that's why I'm here now.

'Coming to a new club you want to get your first game under your belt and I'm over the moon to get that first game out of the way.

'The main focus for me now is to keep training hard week in, week out and give the manager a decision to make.'

Rob Green has recovered from illness and could displace McCarthy against Villa.

McCarthy is happy with the competition provided by the former England goalkeeper as he bids to match his manager's prediction of future international honours.

'I don't know whether I'm playing or not,' he said.

'Me and Greeny have a really good relationship. We respect each other and we train hard and push each other as hard as possible. Whoever is playing, we support each other.

McCarthy will have to dislodge Robert Green if he is to become Queens Park Rangers' No 1

'You want to play for your country, which would be an amazing feeling and achievement.

'But my main goal is to keep playing week in, week out here and England call-ups will hopefully come along.'

The QPR squad have been able to joke about Taarabt's feud with Redknapp this week after the Moroccan dismissed his manager's suggestion he was overweight.

McCarthy added: 'We've had a few laughs here and there about it, but Adel doesn't take anything to heart.

'It's nothing to do with me - it's to do with them. The whole team has been focused and it hasn't affected anyone at all.

'He has been out there but he's had an illness the last couple of days so we haven't seen much of him, but when he's been out there he's been good.'

QPR have four points this term after beating Sunderland and losing to Stoke and are keen to extend Villa's losing streak of four games to five.

'It's a good time (to play Villa), with the results, how they've been going,' McCarthy added.

'We've been doing everything we can on the training pitch (and) there's a lot of positives to take from last Sunday's game that we can take into Monday's game.

'We've prepared right for Monday and we're looking forward to the game.'
