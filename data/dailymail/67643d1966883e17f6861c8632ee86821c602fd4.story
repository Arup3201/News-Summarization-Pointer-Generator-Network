Barcelona's class proved too much for Manchester City over the course of two legs in their last 16 Champions League tie. 

And while Lionel Messi was once again the star for the home side as he tore City to shreds at the Nou Camp, the Argentine hit one stumbling block in the shape of  keeper Joe Hart.

The England stopper made an incredible 10 saves to deny Barca during the game, so here Sportsmail looks at the best images of their on-pitch battle.

Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Manchester City keeper Joe Hart embrace at the final whistle at the Nou Camp

Hart and Messi share a hug after Barcelona sealed a 3-1 aggregate win to progress to the Champions League quarter-finals

Hart lunges at Messi during the game with the Argentine looking to take the Manchester City keeper on

Perhaps fearing the worst, Hart closes his eyes as he hopes to make a clean tackle on Messi with his onrushing challenge

With the outside of his left knee, Hart crucially takes control of the ball away from Messi who was already past the keeper looking to score

Seeing he has made a stop, Hart's eyes open looking at the ball as Messi is left looking back at the Manchester City keeper

With the ball already gone between the pair of them, Hart is left reflecting on a fine save as Messi sees a good chance to score pass

Messi, having turned Bacary Sagna, was again denied by Hart trying to bend a shot around the keeper

Hart made 10 saves in the match and Messi was left with no way to get past as the keeper forced him out wide in another one-on-one chance
