British Interpol officials had warned that a professor’s son arrested over a frenzied murder in Costa Rica was a dangerous individual linked to a string of sex crimes and likely to commit acts of barbarism.

Alfred Saunders – the son of wealthy London academics – was captured last Wednesday as he emerged covered in blood from a tent in which Alexandra Drbohlavova had been stabbed to death.

The 20-year-old is in a high-security 
jail awaiting investigation for the gruesome murder at an idyllic 
rainforest ‘eco farm’ owned by a Briton.

Victim: Alexandra Drbohlavova died following 15 stab wounds

The 20-year-old is in a high-security jail awaiting investigation for the gruesome murder at an idyllic rainforest ‘eco farm’ owned by a Briton.

A senior Costa Rican police official last night told the Mail that a ‘green Interpol alert’ had been sent out from Britain in November saying Saunders was at large in Central America.

It linked him to sex crimes, possession of explosives and a fatal assault. The alert said he was liable to commit offences against minors.

Marisel Rodriguez, of Costa Rica’s judicial police force, said officials picked up on Saunders’s alleged past when he crossed the border from Nicaragua the day after Boxing Day.

Inexplicably, he was still allowed to enter the country.

The next day he turned up without warning, and with almost no possessions, at the farm owned by Nic Donati.

Mr Donati took pity on him and gave 
him a tent for the night – yet hours later reportedly had to overpower 
him after hearing the screams of Czech student Miss Drbohlavova.

The 22-year-old, who had been a 
volunteer at the farm for just over a fortnight, was stabbed 15 times in
 the face, neck and chest.

Miss Rodriguez said: ‘The man being held over the murder of the Czech woman is the subject of a green Interpol notice.

‘It’s a warning mechanism Interpol 
uses and makes available to other countries’ law enforcement agencies 
and border control organisations.

‘In Mr Saunders’s case it was for sex
 crimes, assault resulting in death, torture or acts of barbarism, and 
the possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives.

‘The notice described him as a violent individual who as well as being a suicide risk, was liable to commit sexual crimes against minors and could be armed.

‘It also described him as suffering from mental illness.’

Alexandra - a keen volleyball player - had gone on to study at Florida's Miami University in the U.S.

She said Costa Rican Interpol had recommended he be refused entry to the country but immigration officials took a different view.

‘Our understanding is that Mr Saunders has a police record and may have been tried but not necessarily convicted on all if any of the crimes,’ she added.

‘We haven’t been given any detailed information on where these other offences are said to have taken place but my understanding is that it was in Britain.’

Saunders is the son of Max Saunders, professor of English at Kings College London and of his former wife, Catia Galatariotou, a psychoanalyst.

He lived with his mother at her £1million mews house in Notting Hill. The prison holding Saunders was in lockdown yesterday following a gang fight which left two dead and ten other injured.

Gun-toting wardens patrolled barbed wire-swathed watch towers to prevent further violence.

Last night, friends in Miss Drbohlavova’s native Prague talked of their shock at her death – and of her selfless life.

The philosophy graduate, Christian and volleyball player had been undertaking further studies at Miami University and had travelled to Costa

Rica to further her research during her Christmas break.

Lenka Janalova, a university friend from Prague, said: ‘I can’t believe this has happened. It is an absolute shock to all of us who knew her.

‘Sasa (her nickname) was such a kind, sweet person. She was always smiling and willing to help others.

‘I
 can only imagine the horror she must have felt when she found a man 
inside her tent. She was always so calm and peaceful – the horror of this
 is beyond words.’

Tourist destination: Costa Rica has many national parks with volcanoes and rainforests. As a result of the country's reputation for relative safety in Central America, it has proved popular with British 'gap-year' youngsters seeking adventure.

Tomas Johanovsky, another friend, said she had helped to run a scout group in Prague since she was 15, and became a volunteer leader for the troop when she turned 18.

He said: ‘She was a very good friend and very dedicated to helping people. She was always open and friendly, and never said anything bad about anyone.

‘She saw the best in people and was one of our most popular leaders.’

He said the Drbohlavova family had previously lived in the U.S. and Miss Drbohlavova had been looking forward to returning to study there.

Mr Johanovsky added: ‘She was interested in nature and the environment. I knew she was hoping to travel to help her studies.’
