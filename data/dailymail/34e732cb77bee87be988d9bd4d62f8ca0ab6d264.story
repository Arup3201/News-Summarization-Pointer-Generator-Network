A European court ruling could undermine legal powers used to track down terrorists, paedophiles and serious criminals, it was feared last night.

European judges ruled that a powerful law used to force internet companies to store data about their users’ online activities - so it can be accessed if needed during a police investigation - was excessively intrusive.

Last night the implications of the judgment were being rapidly assessed by the Home Office, police and security agencies amid fears it could drastically undermine their ability to investigate crimes.

One Whitehall source said the ruling was ‘potentially very significant’.

The ruling concerns a European Union directive around the storing of personal data by internet companies which came into force in 2006.

The law allows governments and law enforcement agencies to require internet and phone companies to store information about users’ web activities, email and phone use for up to two years.

They are paid to do so by police and the Government so that information can be used if needed for criminal investigations.

But the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg found that the rules ‘interfere in a serious manner with the fundamental rights to respect for private life’.

The storing and potential use of the data - without the person’s knowledge - is likely to lead to people feeling that their ‘private lives are the subject of constant surveillance’ the court said.

Senior police officers said the use of such data was ‘essential in combating serious and organised crime, protecting the public and ensuring national security.’

Initial readings of the ruling appeared to suggest that it completely ruled out any data collection by technology firms.

However, a spokesman for ISPA, the trade association for internet providers said its members would continue to collect the information.

Nicholas Lansman, ISPA Secretary General said: ‘The CJEU ruling has the potential for major changes to the data retention regime, however we believe that for the time being that obligations remain in place.

‘It is crucial that the European Commission and Home Office provide guidance and clarity to industry.’

Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee her department would ‘look very carefully at the full implications of the judgment’.

Mrs May said communications data had been used in ‘every major case in the last decade’ and was used to identify people who would ‘cause us serious harm’.

Civil liberties campaigners welcomed the ruling. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘This deeply authoritarian Directive was the product of an unholy alliance between Tony Blair’s government and Brussels bureaucrats, using EU law as the fig-leaf to sanction indiscriminate monitoring of data on innocent citizens from Blackpool to Barcelona.

‘We need to arrest this erosion of personal our privacy, and make sure intrusive surveillance is focused on fighting terrorism and serious crime.”

But Assistant Chief Constable Richard Berry, national police spokesman on electronic data, said the information was a ‘useful tool’ in combatting organised criminals.

‘We remain convinced that there is a significant role for communications interception and the acquisition of data communications in keeping the public safe, and our commitment to balancing that with our legal and human rights duties remains equally strong.’

One MEP said the ruling meant urgent new powers were needed. Timothy Kirkhope, home affairs spokesman for the European Conservatives and Reformists group said the ruling should not be allowed to hamper law enforcement.

He said: ‘This ruling is frustrating but there are understandable privacy concerns about indiscriminate collection and retention of people’s data.

‘Criminals and terrorists are growing increasingly sophisticated, so law enforcement must have the tools necessary to keep up with them.

‘That’s why we need a directive that balances both privacy concerns with the need to tackle a constant threat.’
