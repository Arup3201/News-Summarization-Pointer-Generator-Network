A skating national anthem singer proved that the show must go on when he tripped over a red carpet and went flying across the ice at a hockey game in British Colombia.

Mark Donnelly showed himself to be a true professional after taking the embarrassing tumble, when he scrambled back to his feet and carried on skating - all without missing a beat of his rousing rendition of 'O Canada'.

Not that it is an entirely flawless recovery. The indomitable singer belly slides a couple of paces and then stumbles twice before finally making it to his feet again and gliding off on his skates.

Mr Donnelly, 54, a legendary anthem singer for the Vancouver Canucks, was singing at a British Columbia Hockey League game in Penticton last week.

The father-of-nine has been skating since the age of 10, and he has sung the Canadian national anthem on the ice nearly 40 times before without ever slipping up.

'There was a ceremonial face-off beforehand and the carpet was supposed to have been taken up,' Mr Donnelly told ABC News. 'On the video, it looks much brighter than it is - but on the ice it's quite dark.'

Mr Donnelly had only just started singing the anthem when he skated up to the red carpet and took a tumble

'I didn't even see the carpet until I'd skated around the team and come around the other side to see what I'd tripped on,' he added. 'That's what I was thinking about while I kept singing: "What the heck did I trip on?"'

Fortunately, Mr Donnelly was not hurt in the tumble, although he did suffer a sore left knee and a slight dent to his pride.

'I'm sure I'm going to be getting a few offers of skating lessons,' he joked.

When asked how he was able to keep singing even as he hit the ice, Mr Donnelly told ABC that he had applied a lesson from another part of his life.

'I recently lost half my body weight and I give presentations on goal setting and perseverance, so I guess I kind of applied my own advice to that by keeping on,' said Mr Donnelly, who went from 370 pounds to around 180 pounds in two years.

'You just keep going,' he added.
