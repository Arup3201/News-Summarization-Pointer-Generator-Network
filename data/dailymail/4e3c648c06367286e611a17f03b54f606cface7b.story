A Penn State cheerleader is fighting for her life after falling five stories from a window at an off-campus apartment building over the weekend.

Sophomore Paige Raque fell 39 feet from an off-campus housing complex on Saturday and suffered severe brain and pelvic injuries after landing on pavement.

She opened her eyes yesterday for the first time since the fall, but remains in critical condition, a family spokesman said.

Long way down: Authorities have not said whether or not alcohol played a factor in the cheerleader's fall over the weekend

Randy Jepson, the Penn State men's gymnastics coach, said Tuesday that Ms Raque showed 'some positive signs' after some making small movements and opening her eyes.

'It's a good sign, but it's going to be a slow process,' Mr Jepson said in a phone interview with the Associated Press. Raque, 19, of Louisville, Kentucky, remained in the intensive care unit, he said.

Raque's brother, Parker, is the men's gymnastics team captain, and has been keeping friends and family updated via his Twitter feed.

'Much more positivity with our family after seeing a little progress today,' he wrote Tuesday.

He last wrote: ‘Wanna thank everyone who took a moment for our beautiful Paigey. Continue to #prayforpaige fervently as we watch God heal her body.’

Police said Tuesday an investigation was continuing at the Calder Commons apartment complex, though the fall appears to have been accidental, the Centre Daily Times reported.

They declined to say whether alcohol was involved.

Authorities have said the cheerleader fell 39 feet through a screened window during a party Saturday night on the fifth floor of the downtown apartment building.

for our beautiful Paigey. Continue to pray for Paige fervently as we 
watch God heal her body.'

A university directory listed Ms Raque's address on the same floor.

She was flown to Altoona Regional Health System with head and pelvic injuries.

Ms Raque and her family were flooded with messages of support on social media. Penn State football coach Bill O'Brien extended his well-wishes when asked about the fall at his weekly press conference Tuesday.

'My heart goes out to Paige and her family, and I feel terrible about that,' Mr O'Brien said. 'I know her brother is a great gymnast here, and it's a terrible thing.'

Brotherly love: Her brother, Parker Rique, who also attends Penn State, tweeted words of encouragement

Thankful: Mr Raque has been keeping friends and family updated on his Twitter feed, and thanked them for their prayers

Mr Jepson said the family appreciated the kind thoughts from across the Penn State campus. 'The biggest thing the family is requesting is prayer and support,' he said.

Ms Raque graduated from the Christian Academy of Louisville in 2011.

Records show that she was a talented athlete in high school, running in short-distance track and field sprints and relays. She also did the long jump.
