From New York to Paris via London and Milan, fashion week was a celebration of all things weird and wonderful.

And ensuring that the fashion festivities went out with a bang, notoriously quirky Dutch designer Iris van Herpen's show in Paris last night closed fashion week in all its wacky glory.

While Karl Lagerfeld sent his models down a supermarket themed runway complete with trollies at Chanel and Stella McCartney saw Cara Delevingne and Joan Smalls skip down hers, Iris van Herpen may have just one-upped them all.

All in the name of fashion: Models were displayed in a vacuum pack for  Iris Van Herpen's AW14 show

The eccentric designer, whose fans include Lady Gaga and Daphne Guinness, sent her models down the catwalk vacuum-packed in giant clear plastic bags.

The models, who were akin to quarantined aliens in the creepy display, remained motionless as fashion fans marveled the bizarre display.

Concerned and intrigued, the front row took to social media to ask the questions on everyone's lips: How can they breathe? Is it comfortable?

Others pointed out that the tubes in the bags may be used as a breathing aide (although some of the models remained eerily still in their foetal-like position the entire show).

What on earth will next season bring?

Creepy: Some of the models were positioned into foetal-like shapes, while others appeared to be standing up in a motionless position

Ready and waiting: The models were vacuum-packed long before the show guests arrived to marvel the wacky display

What clothes? While all eyes were on the crazy vacuum-packed displays, the designer, who is loved by Lady Gaga, offered some stylish silver dresses
