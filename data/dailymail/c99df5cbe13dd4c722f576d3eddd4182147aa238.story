David Cameron and his wife Samantha ‘take turns’ with household tasks - with the Prime Minister in charge of making his children's tea tonight.

Mr Cameron revealed that the couple, who have three children, mainly tackle the chores in their Oxfordshire constituency home.

He admitted the family home is equipped with numerous appliances, as Nancy, Elwen and Florence make ‘quite a lot of mess to clear up’.

David Cameron, holding a vacuum at the Dyson factory today, has insisted that he shares the chores with his wife Samantha

The PM made the comments during a tour of the Dyson factory in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, after the company pledged to spend £1 billion on research and development.

Mr Cameron was asked by reporters whether he or his wife was responsible for the vacuuming in their household.

‘It's a bit of a task, we take these things in turn,’ Mr Cameron replied. ‘When we are in the constituency that's where we tend to do that.'

The Prime Minister added: 'Tonight I have to make the children's tea so you'd better get on and ask me some questions.’

Mr Cameron was also asked whether he owned any Dyson products but would not specify whether he did or not. He said: 'There's a range of appliances.'

‘I won't go into all of the details but there's a lot of appliances because when you've got three children there's quite a lot of mess to clear up.’

Mr Cameron said he takes it in turns with his wife to do the household chores and revealed that tonight he had to make the children's tea

During the visit, Mr Cameron was shown new Dyson products by Sir James Dyson in his office, including a robot vacuum cleaner.

He viewed prototypes of products created by 3D printing and then met engineers in a research laboratory at the factory.
