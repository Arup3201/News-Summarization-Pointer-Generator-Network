Shares in leading energy firms dropped by up to five per cent today as the markets reacted to Labour’s 1970s-style plan to freeze power bills.

Energy firms said capping prices would halt the investment needed to avoid blackouts and lead to gas and electricity shortages.

But Labour leader Ed Miliband today dismissed the 'scare stories' which he claimed were being pedalled by the firms which have been overcharging people for years.

The Labour leader’s pledge to fix bills until 2017 if he wins the general election, which is calculated to appeal to struggling families, was welcomed by consumer groups.

But it prompted an extraordinary threat from one energy giant to quit the UK.

Centrica said it would ‘not be economically viable to continue’ if it had to freeze prices when its costs were rising. The firm’s chairman Sir Roger Carr called the policy ‘a recipe for economic ruin’.

Shares in Centrica, which owns British Gas dropped by five per cent on early trading to less than 377p.

Scottish and Southern Electric also saw shares drop in value, down more than four percent to 1,512p/

Angela Knight, of the Energy UK trade association, warned Mr Miliband's plan would risk jobs and threaten the energy supply.

'Freezing
 the bill, may be superficially attractive, but it will also freeze the 
money to build and renew power stations, freeze the jobs and livelihoods
 of the 600,000 plus people dependent on the energy industry and make 
the prospect of energy shortages a reality, pushing up the prices for 
everyone,' she added.

Liberal Democrat energy secretary Ed Davey said: ‘When they tried to
 fix prices in California it resulted in an electricity crisis and 
widespread blackouts. We can’t risk the lights going out here too.

‘Fixing prices in this way risks blackouts, jeopardises jobs and puts investment in clean, green technology in doubt.’

No UK government has tried to fix electricity prices since the 1970s.

Guy
 Newey, of the Policy Exchange  think-tank, said: ‘Labour would be 
better off scrapping some of the excesses in  green policy.’

But Richard Lloyd, of the consumer group 
Which?, said: ‘Ed Miliband’s promise to fix the broken energy market and
 freeze prices will give hope to the millions worrying about how they 
can afford to heat their homes. We now look forward to seeing the detail
 of how this will work.’

Energy price controls contributed to devastating power cuts across large swathes of California a decade ago.

Long-term price caps in the state were identified as a major disincentive for consumers to conserve energy.

Critics said they also led to a lack of investment in energy infrastructure because the power firms, knowing they could not raise prices, had little incentive to increase output.

Crisis struck in the year 2000 and continued well into the following year.

Millions of people across the state were subject to rolling blackouts lasting for up to two hours.In the winter of 200-1, children in some parts of the state were sent to school with blankets and extra clothes to keep warm and teachers handed out torches.

American football fans were told to huddle together to watch the Superbowl to reduce the number of television sets draining power supplies.

The power cuts led to chaotic scenes across the state, with people trapped in lifts, and traffic lights suddenly going off in the middle of the day.

Energy prices briefly jumped by as much as 800 per cent when the controls were relaxed.

But the price controls were only part of the problem in California, which also suffered from market manipulation by some firms and illegal pipeline shutdowns by the power firm Enron.

Under the plan, if Labour wins the next election it will immediately legislate to stop price rises for 20 months.

It will save the average household £120 each and businesses will be £1,800 better off on their gas and electricity bills.

Mr
 Miliband also promised to scrap the energy watchdog Ofgem and use the 
20 months to overall the competition and transparency rules to smash the
 dominance of the Big Six energy firms.

Labour estimates it the government intervention on prices will cost the Big Six a total of £4.5billion in lost profits.

However,
 it is unclear what could be done to stop the energy companies from 
jacking up their prices on the eve of the 2015 election.

Today Mr Miliband accused the energy companies of peddling 'scare stories' about the potential impact of the price freeze.

He told ITV's Daybreak: 'I would say that they are pretty unreliable witnesses, because these are people who are overcharging people, so of course they are going to say when someone calls  time on it that they are not very happy.

'Then we have got the Government taking their side and saying the same thing, supporting the energy companies.

'That's fine, they can do that, but I am determined to make this change.'

In a letter to the Big Six power firms, Mr Miliband warned that if suppliers refused to work with an incoming Labour government to keep prices down, they risked being seen by consumers as 'part of the problem, not part of the solution'.

But he dismissed suggestions that his plans were similar to the attempted restructuring of the energy industry in California in 2000, which had to be scrapped amid widespread price rises, power shortages and company insolvencies.

'There are bound to be people coming up with scare stories, the energy companies doing that, including about California,' said the Labour leader.

'California was a totally different approach. It was a deregulated approach, not the kind of approach we are talking about.'

Last
 week it emerged energy bills have almost  doubled since 2000, turning 
up the heat on Britain’s already hard-pressed families.

Kiss: Mr Miliband was joined on the stage by his wife Justine who has enjoyed a much higher profile at this year's conference

Mr Miliband’s plan comes in a week when he has lived up to his Red Ed nickname by telling Labour activists he is ‘bringing back socialism’.

And in a confident speech at the party’s conference yesterday he set out a defiantly socialist platform, saying that if he won power in 2015 he would:

The speech delighted the Left, and Len McCluskey, the militant leader of Unite, the country’s largest union and Labour’s biggest financial backer, declared: ‘There wasn’t anything you couldn’t like.’

Former Labour leader Lord Kinnock, pictured in the front row of the Brighton conference clapping and cheering, said Mr Miliband’s vision was ‘brilliant’.

In a speech shot through with attacks on David Cameron and George Osborne as out of touch with working people, Mr Miliband used the phrase ‘Britain can do better than this’ 17 times to wild applause and repeated standing ovations from Labour activists.

He claimed the Prime Minister could never ‘walk in the shoes’ of those who were struggling to get by and would always stand up for the rich and powerful.

Attack: Mr Miliband accused big business of a 'race to the bottom' as he pledged to increase the minimum wage and take on rogue employers and landlords

Race to the top: Mr Miliband said he would take on energy companies, train firms and payday lenders who rip people off

Pitch: Mr Miliband became increasingly animated as he delivered his speech to the packed conference hall

He, by contrast, would fight for workers and had confronted vested interests on media regulation and tobacco controls.

Mr Miliband claimed a ‘vital link between the growing wealth of the country and your family finances’ had been broken and restoring it was his ‘central purpose’.

Mr Cameron, he said, was ‘going on a lap of honour’ having started to turn the economy around but should instead be doing a ‘lap of shame’ for delivering the slowest recovery in 100 years.

‘Britain can’t win a race for the fewest rights at work against the sweat shops of the world,’ he insisted.

Looking left: Many of the policies unveiled by Mr Miliband were seen as stridently left-wing

‘They used to say a rising tide lifts all boats. Now the rising tide just seems to lift yachts.’

He also promised his government would build 200,000 homes a year by 2020, and suggested councils would be given powers to override the objections of neighbouring authorities seeking to block development.

He said Labour would allow the compulsory purchase of land that has planning permission but has not been developed.

Mr Miliband spared the Liberal Democrats, prompting speculation he is leaving the door open to a future power-sharing deal with them. Labour says the power bills policy would save households an average of £120 over two years while costing energy firms £4.5billion.

Strident: In what was seen as one of the most left-wing speeches by a mainstream leader for decades, Mr Miliband vowed to seize land from developers and fix energy prices

Cheers: The speech, delivered without notes, was given a rapturous reception in the conference hall
