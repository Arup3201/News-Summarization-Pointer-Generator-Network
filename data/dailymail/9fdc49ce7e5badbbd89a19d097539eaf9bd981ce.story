It was supposed to be a present, albeit one of a rather surprising nature. 

But a massage Jemima Khan and her boyfriend Russell Brand booked to celebrate the comedian's birthday has resulted in a complaint to the police and an ongoing legal dispute. 

The celebrity couple are now pursuing legal action against the masseuse Szilvia Berki, accusing her of making a number of false allegations.

She is said to be accusing the police of corruption and hacking her phone. She also claims she has been the subject of a cyber attack. 

The drama began in June this year when, according to Ms Berki, a 31-year-old Hungarian-born masseuse, Ms Khan contacted her via text and email, to see if she could provide a massage at her £15million Oxfordshire home, Kiddington Hall. 

Ms Berki, a former researcher, had set up her massage business only a couple of months previously and advertised on a number of different websites, including the beauty directory Wahanda and the classified ads site Gumtree. 

She also set up her own, somewhat amateur, homepage on the internet in which she describes herself as 'a fullfigured, curvy BBW [Big Beautiful Woman] lady in my late 20ies. 

I am a qualified massage therapist with a valid insurance.' 

There is no suggestion that Ms Khan was ordering anything other than a standard massage. 

The Mail on Sunday has chosen not to disclose further details published on the site. 

Ms Berki, who is based in Wimbledon, West London, says Ms Khan, 40, agreed to send a car to drive her 70 miles to Oxfordshire on Saturday June 7, three days after Brand's birthday. 

According to Ms Berki they agreed a fee of £500. 

The original story has been widely reported in the Daily Telegraph and re-published on media websites. 

But last night Ms Berki said: 'I have never had this before – that someone has sent me a driver. To be honest, this was something very special. A fee for a massage is not £500, obviously. But we calculated about four hours' travel time and two hours' massage which is like six hours and then it was a Saturday as well.

'[My normal rate] is £70, £80, £90, £100, it depends really if it is like an aromatic [sic. aromatherapy] massage or I also do Thai yoga massage. So it depends really how long it is and what kind of massage... if I use aromatic oils it costs more. It depends. 

'For Thai yoga massage you have to be fully dressed, you even have to wear your socks because that is how it's done, while for other massages it's different. A massage – at least in my opinion – it's sensual. 

'But then people call up and they say, "I want to have a full service, I want to have a happy ending, I want to have this and that." And this is usually when I hang up the phone on that client.' 

Ms Berki says that when she arrived at the 17th Century Oxfordshire mansion, Ms Khan came out to greet her. 

She said: 'She came to the car. She was wearing a summer dress, white, with some kind of colour on it. She asked me if I was German because of my accent. She was really very nice, very, very nice.' 

However, according to Ms Berki, the atmosphere soured and she was asked to leave. 

Although £500 was paid into her bank account the following Monday, she was so unhappy about the treatment she claims was meted out to her, she went to her local police station the following Saturday and made a complaint. 

Ms Berki told officers she was pushed by Mr Brand and was left terrified after Ms Khan's white German Shepherd jumped at her. 

The driver then took Ms Berki home and Ms Khan later emailed to apologise for any misunderstanding. 

The matter was passed on to Thames Valley Police, which launched an investigation. 

Five weeks later, on July 25, the Thames Valley force contacted Ms Berki to say it was not pursuing the case because there was no independent or forensic evidence. 

They said: 'Thames Valley Police can confirm that it has concluded an investigation referred to us by the Metropolitan Police Service regarding an alleged assault at an address near Woodstock on June 7.

'The investigation into this matter concluded on July 25 and no further action will be taken in relation to this incident.' 

Lawyers representing Russell Brand and Jemima Khan have denied all Ms Berki's allegations. 

There was no physical contact whatsoever, they say, and Mr Brand simply asked her to leave. 

However, Ms Berki is so incensed by the police decision to drop the case she has since lodged a complaint over the way the matter was handled. 

There have been suggestions that Ms Berki's reliability has been under question. Ms Berki said: 'They told me last week, on Friday. I had a little nervous breakdown. 

'I sent a lot of emails to various people asking for help [including her local MP, Zac Goldsmith, who is Jemima's brother]. 

'There is CCTV evidence showing that the dog attacked me. 

'They told me that I looked relaxed and that it was a friendly dog and this is not what the legislation says is a dangerous dog. 

'The policeman said this was not an attack as he jumped on me in a friendly way. How can an animal, a big dog, jump on me in a friendly way? I was very distressed [after what had happened].' 

Thames Valley Police are now in the process of reviewing the initial investigation. 

Meanwhile, lawyers acting on behalf of the celebrity couple warned Ms Berki that they may take legal action if she repeated her 'false and defamatory allegations'. 

She, however, remains defiant and says she is considering pursuing a civil action against the celebrity couple.

A message posted on Szilvia Berki's website describing her as being a 'qualified massage therapist with a valid insurance'  

She said: 'I have the right to speak about it. They admitted they can't stop me talking to the police.'

Mr Brand was a rather startling choice of partner for Ms Khan, the socialite daughter of the billionaire Jimmy Goldsmith who has two children by her former husband, the Pakistani cricketer and politician, Imran Khan. 

News of the couple's relationship emerged in September 2013 when they were spotted strolling arm in arm around New York's East Village. 

Brand has also formed a strong bond with Jemima's dog, a white German Shepherd named Brian, and has frequently been seen walking him. 

The comedian even took Brian along to a Comic Relief press conference and an interview for The Jonathan Ross Show, where he invited the dog to sit alongside him on the sofa. 

Known for his edgy and often ripe humour, Russell Brand has enjoyed a successful career as a stand-up comedian, actor and writer. 

Much of his material is influenced by his own difficult experiences, including battles with drug and sex addiction. 

While he landed a few TV roles in the 1990s, his made his mark in stand-up comedy. 

He competed for New Act of the Year at the Hackney Empire in 2000 and soon got a job on MTV as a presenter, but was fired the following year after coming to work dressed as Osama Bin Laden on the day after the September 11 terrorist attacks. 

'Put bluntly, it was a very stupid thing to do and I put it under what I call the "drug-brella" – stuff I did while on drugs,' Brand later said. 

He was soon picked up by other networks, including Channel 4 and the BBC, from which he resigned in 2008 after leaving crass voicemail messages along with Jonathan Ross for veteran actor Andrew Sachs concerning his granddaughter.

In 2010 he married US pop star Katy Perry, but ended the marriage 14 months later. 

In her autobiography, she said Brand never spoke to her again after sending her a text message initiating the divorce. 

Brand joked in his stage act that being in a monogamous relationship with Perry was little better than being a monk because he was unable to have sex with other women.
