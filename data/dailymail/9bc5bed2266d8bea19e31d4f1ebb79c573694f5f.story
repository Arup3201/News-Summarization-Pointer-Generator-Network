An artist who was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and left unable to eat many of his favourite foods has turned her cravings into striking artworks.

Maor Zabar's clever designs include a berry pie beret, a tasty-looking fish pie fascinator and even a salad sombrero.

The 36-year-old Israeli artist carefully recreated each ingredient using felt, plastic and wire before fixing it all to hats

The 36-year-old costume designer began creating the designs of foods his Crohn's prevented him from eating

Maor Zabar's designs are certainly original but it is their incredibly realistic appearance that makes them stand out

'When I discovered I had Crohn's disease I was forced to start a special diet and was unable to eat many of the foods I have always loved,' said the artist, who also works as a costume designer.

'So instead of eating them, I created them out of felt and fibres and made them into beautiful fascinators.'

Now cured of his illness, he added: 'I am able to eat what I like now but I still love making new additions to my Food Hat collection.'

Mr Zabar, who is a teacher at Shenkar's College of Fashion in Israel, has been making the hats and fascinators for two years.

His inspiration is derived mainly from his work as a theatre set designer, using the different costumes from throughout history.

One particularly striking specimen is this inverted ice cream cone creation

Talk about something looking fishy! This design would certainly catch people's attention 

Maor uses just simple materials such as felt and wires to create his unique designs 

He hopes that women who wear his hats feel 'glamorous but still unique, creative and sometimes even humorous'

Each of the hats is made differently, requiring different timescales depending on their intricacy

'I do believe my work is unique and I hope people see that. I have a hunger and an urge to create beautiful headpieces for women to wear that will make them feel glamorous but still unique, creative and sometimes even humorous.

'My hats are designed with a wink in the eye and a tongue in the cheek and I think that is what my customers really respond to.

'People buy hats from me because they want something that stands out from the crowd and I am more than happy to oblige.' 

The level of detail in some of the designs, such as this outdoor picnic, is amazing

Mavor, who is a teacher at Shenkar's College of Fashion in Israel, has been making the fascinators for over two years now
