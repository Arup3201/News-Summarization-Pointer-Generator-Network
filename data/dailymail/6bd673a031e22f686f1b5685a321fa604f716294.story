Visitors from across the world gathered for the spectacular performance, which was held today at Harbin Pole Aquarium in the country's Heilongjiang province.

They witnessed the whales gliding gracefully through the water, before forming a variety of impressive shapes, including a heart.

The creatures could also be seen posing behind their trainers with mischievous smiles, twisting their streamline bodies and waving their fins at the crowds.

They even took the time to thank their trainers by planting a kiss on their lips.

The annual show - which reflects the true intimacy between humans and their animal companions - was met with applause, laughter and gasps of awe.

It is only one of several breathtaking shows available at the aquarium at Sun Island, which also offers fish, shark, dolphin, sea lion and white wolves performances.

The aquarium is the first polar land-themed park combining animal shows with polar land sights - with more than 10,000 polar creatures on its premises.

However, the white whales have stiff competition from other animal species - with horses and dogs, such as former Britain's Got Talent winners Ashleigh and Pudsey, also being known for their dancing abilities.
