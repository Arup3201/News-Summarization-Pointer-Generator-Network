Lexi Branson (pictured) was killed when the Aylestone-Bulldog pet suddenly attacked her in 2013

 A pet bulldog mauled a four-year-old girl to death as her mother tried desperately to beat it off with her hands and a knife.

Jodi Hudson told yesterday how she hit the dog as its jaws gripped the throat of her daughter Lexi Branson.

She then went to get ‘the biggest knife I could find’ and repeatedly stabbed the crazed animal, which she had taken in only weeks earlier without knowing it had six previous owners and a history of violence, an inquest heard.

She eventually managed to stab the dog to death and carry Lexi from the two-bedroom flat. 

Miss Hudson, 31, said she tried to revive her daughter before paramedics – alerted by a neighbour who had heard screaming – arrived. Lexi was taken to hospital but died.

Miss Hudson told the coroner that she paid £50 to a rehoming centre last October for the Aylestone bulldog – which she named Mulan after the Disney heroine. 

It had been advertised as ‘better suited to a home without young children’.

But when she asked kennel staff about this, she was told only the dog had a ‘tendency to jump up’ and could knock children over because of its size.

However, Mulan had six owners before being taken in by Willow Tree rehousing centre in Barrow-upon-Soar, Leicestershire, in August 2013, the inquest at Loughborough heard.

The last of these called a warden claiming to have found the dog, thought to be aged between six and eight, wandering in a park near his home. 

Police, said the man, who was not identified, had owned Mulan for only a matter of hours when it attacked his other dog. He feared it could savage his young children.

Detective Sergeant Kenny Henry of Leicestershire Police told the inquest the man had lied about finding the animal because ‘you have to pay to hand a dog in’.

It meant that kennel staff had no idea about the dog’s background.

The dog warden, Jodie Barlow, said Mulan ‘seemed like a yard dog or guard dog’ and ‘didn’t seem like a family pet’. In her notes to the rehoming centre, she said the dog had marks on its face which suggested it had been fighting.

The inquest also heard that the manager of a rescue centre for Aylestone bulldogs visited the rehoming centre with a view to taking on Mulan, but decide not to as he believed the dog was an Aylestone cross. At the time of the incident, police described the animal as a bulldog, and said they were working to establish the exact breed.

Mulan had been microchipped by its first owner but, when traced by the centre, he said he did not want the dog back. 

Unknown to the staff at the kennels from where he was collected, the bulldog named Mulan (pictured) had gone through the hands of several owners and had acted aggressively  before

A young Willow Tree worker, who had no formal training in the assessment or behaviour of dogs, judged Mulan to be ‘laid back and placid’ and suitable for rehoming. 

The inquest heard that the centre’s only procedure for checking whether new owners were suitable was the completion of a form. Staff were not required to visit homes before placing an animal.

Miss Hudson said Mulan had shown ‘no signs of aggression at all’ and allowed itself to be cuddled by Lexi. 

On November 5, the girl was off school sick and watching TV in the lounge at the flat in Mountsorrel, near Loughborough, when the fatal attack occurred.

Miss Hudson, a single parent, said Mulan ‘went stiff’. She added: ‘The dog went on all fours and stared at Lexi. I said, “No Mulan”, and tapped her and that’s when she went for Lexi. 

The funeral for four-year-old Lexi was held in November last year. Pictured is the procession leaving the Holy Trinity Church in Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire (left), followed by Lexi's mother Jodi Hudson (right)

She went straight for her throat and then around to her mouth.’

Lexi was knocked to the floor as Miss Hudson struggled with Mulan, trying to prise open its jaws before grabbing the knife.

Asked by Trevor Kirkman, senior coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire, whether stabbing the animal was immediately successful in halting its attack, Miss Hudson replied: ‘No... It seemed like an eternity.’

A post-mortem found Lexi died from extensive injuries to her face and neck, which obstructed her airway, preventing her from breathing. The inquest continues. 

Tributes were left near the scene where Lexi was killed in the days following the attack (pictured)

Pathologist Dr Roger Malcolmson told the court Lexi had died of facial injuries and external airway obstruction.

He said: 'She had extensive injuries to both her face and neck area which would be concurrent with being attacked by a dog.

'She had slight injuries to her hands showing she had tried to fight back and had not died instantly.

'Her injuries were consistent with an external obstruction to her airways.'
