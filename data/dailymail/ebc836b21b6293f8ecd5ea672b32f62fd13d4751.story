Danny Ings has shown his kind side by vowing to help a little girl with a life-threatening illness to complete her bucket list, reports the Manchester Evening News.

Burnley striker Ings arranged to meet Harlee-Jae Procter, four, and her family, after reading about her story on Twitter.

Harlee-Jae suffers from a rare genetic condition and is a huge fan of Ings' team Burnley.

The striker, tipped as a future England international, was so moved by her plight that he met her at his club's training ground and promised to help her tick off as many of the items on her wishlist as possible.

Ings said he had made 'a new best friend' after meeting with the schoolgirl.

The Clarets hotshot has now promised to take Harlee-Jae to the zoo, to Turf Moor as his mascot and even joked he would dress as Elsa from the film Frozen to entertain her.

Harlee-Jae became a fan of Ings after playing the video game FIFA.

During their meeting, she told him about her hopes to be a cowgirl, ride an elephant and eat breakfast with Barney the Dinosaur.

Ings told the M.E.N.: 'It's a nice feeling for me to meet her. Hopefully we can work together and tick off as many things as we can. I think we can do most of them. 

Ings has been excellent for Burnley recently and his form earned him a kiss on the cheek from his super-fan

'We're going to contact the zoo and see if we can go there for the afternoon and we're going to see some animals so I'm really looking forward to that.

'I've never been to a zoo so I'm looking forward to it just as much as she is. I'm really excited for it.

'I've got myself a new best friend. And she gave me a kiss on the cheek as well which was nice.'

Thorn Primary School pupil, Harlee-Jae suffers from microdeletion 17 q12, which causes her health problems including kidney disease.

She is likely to need liver and kidney transplants before adulthood.

Mum Sasha Procter, 25, said Danny's efforts to help Harlee-Jae were overwhelming.

She said: 'All she's said all weekend is "Danny Ings". We never ever expected him to do anything like this – she just wanted to meet him.

'You don't see many Premier League footballers doing something like this. Hopefully we can tick off some items from the list together.'

Since creating her list, Harlee-Jae has flown in an airplane cockpit, travelled in a police car with Bacup officers and is due to visit the Lancashire Police Mounted Section.

Ings and Harlee-Jae have already planned a trip to the zoo, which is a first for both of the two friends
