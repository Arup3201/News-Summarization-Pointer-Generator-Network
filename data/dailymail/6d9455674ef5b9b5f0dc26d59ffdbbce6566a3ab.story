Sexual misconduct complaints lodged with the BBC’s investigations unit now amount to allegations against almost 30 staff and presenters at the corporation, it was revealed today.

The total of 29 past and present workers is more than triple the figure given by BBC director-general George Entwistle in evidence to MPs two weeks ago, when nine people were under investigation.

The BBC said the number of complaints ‘will fluctuate both up and down as new allegations are made and investigated’. It is not yet known whether any complaints are linked to Jimmy Savile.

‘Once they (the allegations) have been investigated - either resulting in further action or the matter being cleared and resolved - the cases will be closed,’ a BBC spokesman told the Sunday Times.

The rising figures come after the national broadcaster launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of the late TV and radio presenter's alleged sexual abuse.

Savile, who died last year aged 84, is believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims. Scotland Yard is leading a national investigation into his activities.

A Slater & Gordon solicitor told the Sunday Times that more than 30 potential Savile victims have come to the firm - and their claims range from when they were aged just seven up to adulthood.

The BBC could face a full public inquiry into the sex abuse scandal if its investigations - including their probe into the shelved Newsnight probe - fail to ‘get to the bottom’ of the accusations.

'There’s no question that what Jimmy Savile did and the way the BBC behaved - the culture and practices of the BBC seemed to allow Jimmy Savile to do what he did - will raise questions of trust for us and reputation for us'

Culture Secretary Maria Miller told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘The real challenge for the BBC is to make sure that the outcome of these reviews really gets to the bottom of these accusations.

‘If the investigations are considered not to suffice because of issues around transparency, process or other such things, then a public inquiry remains an option.’

Mr Entwistle, 50, told the culture, media and sport select committee on October 23: 'There’s no question that what Jimmy Savile did and the way the BBC behaved - the culture and practices of the BBC seemed to allow Jimmy Savile to do what he did - will raise questions of trust for us and reputation for us.

Veteran presenter: Jonathan Dimbleby said there has been a 'disturbing relish' in the way critics have laid into the BBC over the Savile scandal.

'It is a gravely serious matter and one cannot look back at it with anything but horror that his activities went on as long as they did, undetected.'

Savile scandal.

The Radio 4 presenter said there has been a ‘witch-hunt’
against the corporation since allegations the celebrity abused hundreds of
young girls and women - some on BBC premises - emerged.

Blaming the media and politicians for getting their priorities
wrong, Mr Dimbleby said: ‘Organisations that have come under flak recently such
as newspapers and MPs want to get their revenge. They think the BBC is too smug
and holier-than-thou.

‘But there is a disturbing relish in the way the critics
have laid into the BBC, holding today's office-holders to account for what
happened 30 years ago.’
