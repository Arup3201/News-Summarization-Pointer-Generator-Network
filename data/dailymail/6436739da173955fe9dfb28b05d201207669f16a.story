The company that manufactures Apple's iPhone has found children as young as 14 working at one of its factories in China, it revealed today.

Foxconn Technology Group said the youngsters had been placed in internships of between three and six months, for which the minimum age in China is 16.

The teenagers were found during a company investigation at its factory in the eastern city of Yantai and sent back to school.

Close scrutiny: Foxconn, which has factories across several Chinese cities, said it was working with the interns' schools to try to find out how they had been put into the jobs. Pictured, Foxconn Shanghai

Foxconn is one of China's biggest employers, with around 1.2million employees in factories across several cities.

Its internship program takes vocational students, who work in its factories, accompanied by teachers.Â 

Foxconn faced a complaint in August 
that students were being forced by their schools to work in its Chinese
factories, but the firm insisted they were free to leave at
any time.

It has now said in a statement: 'We 
recognise that full responsibility for these violations rests with our 
company and we have apologised to each of the students for our role in 
this action.

'Any Foxconn employee found, through 
our investigation, to be responsible for these violations will have 
their employment immediately terminated.'

High demand: The Chinese factories produce iPhones and iPads for Apple, as well as assembling products for heavyweight corporations Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard

Foxconn, owned by Taiwan's Hon Hai 
Precision Industry Co., said it was now investigating with the schools 
how the interns were sent to its factory. It did not say how many 
underage interns it found.

The company produces iPhones and iPads 
for Apple and assembles products for Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. The 
company gave no indication of which products were made in facilities 
where the interns worked.

China Labor Watch said that primary responsibility lay with schools involved but 'Foxconn is also culpable for not confirming the ages of their workers.'

Conditions in factories in China are a sensitive issue for foreign brands that outsource production of shoes, consumer electronics and other goods to local contractors.

Last month, Foxconn suspended production for an entire day at a factory in the city of Taiyuan after a brawl involving as many as 2,000 employees, in which 40 people were injured.

The Fair Labor Association, which was hired by Apple to audit working conditions at Foxconn factories, said in August that improvements it recommended in March were being carried out ahead of schedule.

That included verifying the ages of student interns.
