Liverpool could bank as much as £10million from their two friendly matches in Australia this summer.

Brendan Rodgers’ side will face Brisbane Roar at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium on July 17 before taking on Adelaide United at the Adelaide Oval three days later.

Liverpool confirmed earlier this month they would be returning following the success of their first trip to Australia in 2013 when they played Melbourne Victory in front of 95,000 fans at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Tickets for both matches went on general sale on Tuesday with the entire allocation for the Adelaide United game on July 20 snapped up already. A sell-out is expected at the 52,000 capacity Suncorp Stadium too.

The South Australian Government has paid Liverpool an appearance fee of around £800,000 but Liverpool will also keep all the gate receipts from the game in Adelaide which will amount to around £3million.

That figure will be swelled by merchandise sales with Liverpool expected to wear their New Balance kit.

Robbie Fowler was in Brisbane as a Liverpool ambassador promoting the game against Brisbane Roar in his role as a Liverpool FC ambassador.

Fowler said: 'We as a club still talk about the MCG game. I think the support we had then was unreal and it was special. It’s not a clichéd answer when I say we still talk about it.

'Just get on YouTube and search ‘’You’ll Never Walk Alone at the MCG’. It was unbelievable.'
