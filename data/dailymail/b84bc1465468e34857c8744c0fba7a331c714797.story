Peter Cross experienced post-traumatic stress disorder after staying on an intensive care unit

Peter
 Cross knew it would take time to recover after major cancer surgery. 
Doctors had found cancerous cells in his oesophagus, or gullet, and 
planned to remove it and reattach his stomach to his throat. 

Peter
 would spend at least a week in hospital, including a stint in intensive
 care. Full recovery could take a year and his digestion would be 
permanently affected.

'I 
approached the operation with some trepidation,' says Peter, a father of
 five, who works with children with autism. 'But I still saw it as a 
cure.'

Although Peter, 61, 
prepared himself for the physical aftermath, he never dreamed the 
experience in February last year would affect his mental health. 

However,
 as a result of his time in intensive care, he developed post-traumatic 
stress disorder and depression, from which - more than a year later - he
 is only just starting to recover. 

Astonishingly,
 every year up to 50,000 people in Britain suffer the same experience 
after a stay in intensive care, also known as critical care. 

Patients
 are moved to these wards during major illness, or after injury or 
surgery, and are placed on specialised monitoring equipment, with one 
highly trained nurse per patient. 

To
 help recovery, these patients are often put on organ support - for 
example, breathing through a ventilator - and may have drips and lines 
attached. The majority are also given powerful sedating drugs to reduce 
pain and make them more comfortable, aiding their recovery. 

But
 these medications can cause disturbing hallucinations and delusions. 
When combined with major surgery or illness and perhaps coming close to 
death, this can leave people with a degree of trauma similar to that 
seen in those returning from a battlefield, say experts.

Often,
 patients are simply not prepared for these delusions, and have been 
known to become violent or even call the police from their hospital bed. 

When Peter came round after 
his surgery at University College London Hospital (UCLH), he was 
completely unprepared for what he saw and heard.

'The
 first thing I was aware of was seeing colours and shapes - like a 
psychedelic painting but on a grand scale,' says Peter, who lives with 
his wife, Patsy, in Reading. 'But this was minor compared with other 
images I was having.'

Peter 
was convinced he'd been taken to Eastern Europe to be questioned for 
information and the hospital ward had been recreated there to fool him. 
He even thought his wife and son were imposters. 'I asked Patsy to show 
me her hysterectomy scar, and to see my son's bank card, thinking that 
would catch them out,' he says.

'Patsy found it very upsetting, particularly because no one explained this was common.'

He was being treated at University College London Hospital last year and still suffers some flashbacks

The
 plan was for Peter to spend three days on intensive care after surgery,
 but he caught pneumonia and had to stay for a further seven days. He 
was put on a ventilator, as well as having drips and lines inserted. He 
was also given painkilling and sedating drugs. 

His
 delusions continued day and night. As well as his Eastern European 
dramas, Peter hallucinated about going to a hospital talk about assisted
 suicide, and saw other patients take their own lives or be helped to 
die by the doctors and nurses with lethal injections. 

In reality, he was bed-bound and heavily sedated. 

When
 doctors reduced the sedation, Peter woke up but the hallucinations 
continued. 'I could see people throwing themselves off the top of a 
canyon and hear the thuds of the bodies. These images are still with me.
 I didn't dare talk to the medical staff - in my mind they were all 
enemies.' 

At one point, though he doesn't remember it, he told his wife he was going to commit suicide.After
 ten days, Peter was moved to a high dependency ward (one level below 
intensive care). Two weeks later, he was finally allowed to go home. He 
was now just on paracetamol, but was still haunted by hallucinations. 

'I
 was starting to realise these things could not have happened. But I 
still got flashbacks every day,' he says. 'I felt very depressed and 
started wondering if I was going mad.' 

Doctors
 have long known that intensive care can traumatise patients. However, a
 2012 study at UCLH found the problem may be far more common than 
thought.

'More than half of 
patients in the study who had been on intensive care suffered clinical 
depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder,' says Dr Dorothy 
Wade, a psychologist at the hospital. This would equate to 50,000 
patients nationwide every year. 'For some people this distress will fade
 with time, but there are studies showing the problem continues at 12 
months,' adds Dr Wade. 

'One 
study showed that, at two years, 40 per cent of patients had clinical 
depression. I've encountered people having terrible flashbacks and 
nightmares ten years later.'

The
 drugs given to intensive care patients are similar to those used to put
 a patient to sleep for surgery. But they are administered for longer 
periods, and as the patient's organs may not be functioning properly, 
they are not broken down and stay in the body, leading to delusions. 

Dr
 Wade's study found patients who received benzodiazepines - a class of 
tranquilliser drug that includes Valium - were at high risk of 
psychological problems. Patients who suffered a high level of distress 
in intensive care and those with a history of depression or anxiety 
suffer more, too.

The trauma 
can be debilitating, affecting work, relationships and family life; some
 patients require therapy and antidepressants. 

Dr
 David Howell, clinical director of critical care at UCLH, says: 'If you
 come through intensive care, people say you're lucky to be alive. But 
patients don't see it that way if they are experiencing daily troubling 
flashbacks.

Intensive care teams are minimising use of sedative drugs because of their psychological consequences

'Many say the 
psychological problems are worse than the physical illness they had to 
start with. We have patients who won't go through further planned 
surgery because they can't face more trauma.' UCLH
 is one of a minority of hospitals that offer an appointment with a 
psychologist to post-intensive care patients who have had a long stay. 
Peter Cross was invited to such a session last August last, six months 
after his operation.  

'They 
said I had borderline post-traumatic stress disorder and borderline 
depression,' he recalls. 'They explained this was a common problem and 
was the result of the drugs I'd been given. Once I saw it was a normal 
thing, and understood the cause, things got easier.'

He
 was also invited to have a tour of the intensive care ward. 'It helped 
put things in place because it was very different from my memories of 
the ward.'

Peter was offered counselling but decided with his doctors that it was not necessary.

Intensive care teams are now moving towards minimising the use of sedative drugs because of their psychological consequences.

Dr
 Wade and Dr Howell are taking part in a £2 million study in 24 
intensive care units to test ways of stopping psychological problems.

Staff
 will be trained in 'psychological first-aid' - learning to talk to 
patients in a calming way to reduce trauma and help them understand why 
they are having delusions. Patients with extreme stress will also have 
cognitive behavioural therapy on the ward. 

Peter
 Cross is now doing well and is back at work part-time. But he thinks 
the UCLH trial is urgently needed. 'A little bit of forewarning would 
have helped. It wouldn't have stopped it happening, but I would have 
been able to put it into context a bit quicker.'
