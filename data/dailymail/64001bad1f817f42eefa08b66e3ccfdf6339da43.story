A woman who is 18 weeks' pregnant was asked to leave a Planet Fitness gym during her workout because her 'belly was hanging out'.

Melissa Mantor, 31, was told by a female employee on Monday that her outfit - of a tank top and leggings - violated dress code at the gym in Charleston, South Carolina.

The stay-at-home mom, who has been married since 2006 and has a three-year-old daughter, told MailOnline: 'I went to the gym for my usual workout but it was the first day that I was visibly pregnant.

'I
 was on the treadmill, when a female employee came up to me and said 
''I'm going to have to ask you to leave, you are in violation of the 
dress code.''

Melissa Mantor, from South Carolina, was asked to leave a branch of Planet Fitness, because her 'belly was hanging out' in this tank top. Mrs Mantor is 18 weeks pregnant

'She then said: ''I'm going to have to send you home to get changed because your belly's hanging out and I need to get it covered up. I told her: ''Of course my belly is hanging out, I am pregnant.'''

The employee then handed her a large, black t-shirt to cover up her pregnant bump. The 31-year-old said: 'People around me were shocked. The girl next to me asked ''Is this really happening?'''

Mrs Mantor finished her workout, went home and tried to call the manager of the gym who didn't respond. She then went into the West Ashley gym the following day to cancel her membership and was told again that she had 'obviously' violated the dress code policy.

She was told that her choice of gym attire 'was not appropriate for our gym members'.

The
 Planet Fitness dress code does not mention bare midriffs but does say 
that customers cannot wear 'string tank tops'.

Mrs Mantor said that she has regularly
 worn the tank top - and about 20 others like it in different colors - in the three years she has been a gym member and it has never been a problem.

 She is even wearing the tank top in her gym membership photograph.

The 31-year-old married mother said that she has regularly worn the tank top and similar ones in different colors to the West Ashley gym

She
 admits that the top does ride up from time to time over her baby bump 
but that prior to this incident, no one had a problem with it.

Mrs Mantor has now canceled her gym membership. She said that a representative from Planet Fitness called to offer a free month's membership but she refused.

'I can't go to a gym where they would make someone feel bad about themselves when they are trying to stay in shape,' she said.

'It's hard enough to get motivated as it is without being made to feel like my body is offensive and that I'm dressed inappropriately.'

Planet Fitness's logo is 'No Gymtimidation'. The mission statement says the company provides a 'diverse, Judgement Free Zone'.

MailOnline reached out to the Planet 
Fitness branch in Charleston but was told that the manager 
was not available for comment.

McCall Gosselin, Director of Public Relations for Planet Fitness, said in a statement: 'The majority of Planet Fitness clubs are owned and operated by individual franchisees. Our corporate dress code policy, which is enforced at the discretion of club staff, states that jeans, boots, men’s string tank tops, or revealing clothing are prohibited.

'This particular location also had a stated policy that prohibited bare midriffs. In this instance, a staff member approached the member to inform her of the policy and offer her a free t-shirt to complete her workout. She was not asked to leave the gym as a result of her attire.

'The franchise owner has reached out to the member directly to address the situation. At Planet Fitness, we are committed to providing a comfortable and welcoming environment for everyone, and we are working with the franchise owner to clarify the dress code policy moving forward.'

This is not the first time that Planet Fitness has faced controversy over its heavy-handed tactics on gym-goers' attire.

An Albuquerque Planet Fitness refused to let a Muslim woman wear her religious head covering while she tried to work out, according to a lawsuit filed in March.

Tarainia McDaniel, 37, recently filed the lawsuit in a New Mexico district court stemming from an October 2011 clash that prevented McDaniel from using the gym - even though court documents said another Planet Fitness had previously let her.

The lawsuit said she was turned away at the gym and was told the head covering didn't meet its dress code.

Tiffany Austin, from Richmond, California, claimed in March that a branch of Planet Fitness asked her to cover up because her toned physique was intimidating other members.
