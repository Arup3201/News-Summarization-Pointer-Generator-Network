A 700kg cake, in the shape of an Indian toilet, was unveiled on Wednesday as part of World Toilet Day celebrations in New Delhi.

The message was one of sanitation and cleanliness, in a country where some people still openly defecate on the streets.

The cake was organised by charity Sulabh International, which promotes sanitation in New Delhi and provides toilet facilities across India.

That cake wouldn't have come cheap: Weighing in at 700kg, the cake would not have been cheap

Cutting the cake: The cake was cut by Sulabh International founder Bindeshwar Pathak

According to reports in local media, around 900 students and delegates from Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Laos, Vietnam and Afghanistan took part in the event.

In an attempt to raise awareness for cleanliness and better sanitation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a campaign called the ‘Clean India Mission’.

Speaking with Asian News International, Sulabh International founder Bindeshwar Pathak praised the Indian Prime Minister.

He was pleased that Prime Minister Modi was placing such an emphasis on cleanliness and sanitation.
