From being diagnosed with Crohn's disease  to her break-up with Joey Essex, 2014 hasn't been the best year for Sam Faiers.

The former TOWIE star's professional life is, however, booming. As well as launching her Very clothing line, an eyelash range and a debut fragrance, the reality TV personality is getting set to venture into the fitness world.

Sam, 23, has launched an exclusive website, Celebrity Training with Sam Faiers, packed full of tutorials, advice and tips she says will help you maximise your workout and achieve a healthy, strong and feminine dream body.

Speaking to FEMAIL about her latest venture, the businesswoman said: 'I have wanted to step into the world of health and fitness for a while now, as it’s a big passion of mine. 

'When I lost a lot of weight from my Crohn’s disease, I wanted to make a change and make sure that I was healthy, fit and feminine.

'My motivation is to show that you can keep your body in a healthy and strong place. This is far more important than what size you are. It’s about how you feel.'

Sam isn't the first star of The Only Way Is Essex to launch a fitness project - her friend Lucy Mecklenburgh also has her own online fitness channel.

'Celebrity Training is innovative and different because you can do it at home, work or travelling so can you use it on your smartphone or tablet,' said Sam.

'It's also completely bespoke to you; it has target graphs and you can upload pictures of your improvement. 

'I’ve been working with personal trainer Nicole Attrill to make regular workouts for the website so the content is always fresh.'

TOWIE star Sam said that she always wanted to step into the world of fitness and when she lost  weight from the Crohn's disease diagnosed earlier this year, her priority was remaining healthy, fit and feminine

Sam is so convinced by the power of her programme that she uses it three times a week on her phone or iPad when she's travelling for work.  

She starts  with the warm up, Get Started,  and finishes with Cool Down. Then she alternates between the weights-based Get Strong routine and Get Focused, which includes targeted body exercises.

Diet-wise, she starts the day with an acai berry smoothie, has a sweet potato and carrot soup for lunch and a superfood kale and mushroom frittata for dinner. 

Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel condition which affects 115,000 Britons.

Its symptoms including pain, diarrhoea, vomiting, weight loss and fatigue.

'I also eat a lot of chicken for lunch and dinner and porridge as well for breakfast,' she added. 

'With my Crohn’s I have to be careful with what I eat and Celebrity Training has a great healthy eating expert, Sophie Bradshaw, who recommends the best in healthy home cooking.' 

Although she is following a healthy and sensible diet and exercise regime, Sam admits she has felt pressure to lose weight in the past, particularly prior to her stint on Celebrity Big Brother. 

'I think it’s because there were cameras everywhere  so there was nowhere to hide when it comes to your body,' she said candidly. 

She continued: 'I would say my Crohn’s was a wake-up call, I want to look healthy and not a bag of bones. I couldn’t help it as I was unwell but I wanted to look healthy, fit and feminine and thanks to Celebrity Training I’m so confident with my body now.

'I would say that you should feel confident at any weight or size as beauty is skin deep. I’ve struggled in the past to feel confident - I’ve either been bigger than I wanted to be or too thin. 

'Nowadays I don’t stress about being skinny, I just want to be in a healthy and happy place.'

Sam's plight didn't come without criticism and she came under attack on social media from people who said she was only skinny because she has Crohn's.

In response to those messages, Sam said: 'It's well-known that I found out I have Crohn's earlier this year. Before I got into exercising it was important for me to healthily put some of the weight back on that I'd lost. 

'When I felt ready and was at that point I began moderately training to build and tone my body. It's unfair for people to say I'm skinny because of Crohn's, you don't get abs and definition through Crohn's, it's through working out, healthy eating and my programme I have devised.' 

The fitness fan admires Beyoncé, who she says 'works so hard for her body and looks healthy at the same time', as well as  Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who she thinks looks 'fit and feminine'.

And it seems Sam is aiming for the same level of success as the stars.

'I have a new collection coming out from my range with Very and I will be doing a launch for my lash range, Lashes by Samantha.'

Sam, who unveiled her first clothing range for Very this year, has a new collection coming out in 2015
