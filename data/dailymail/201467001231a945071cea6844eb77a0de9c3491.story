A top novelist has asked her fans to redesign classic novels as if they were being marketed at women in protest at the  'girly' imagery publishers use on book covers for women authors.

American writer Maureen Johnson claims publishers use fluffy imagery to market novels by women, so she asked her Twitter fans to 'coverflip' classics such as Jack Kerouac's On The Road and Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange as if they had female authors.

She was amazed at the number designs sent in from readers sympathetic to her gripe.

Horror classic Carrie by Stephen King, which traditionally has disturbing images of the female protagonist on the cover, was reimagined with a smiling blonde in lipstick and soft pastel shades.

The female version of fantasy masterwork A Game of Thrones by George R.R. Martin, or Georgette R. Martin in this case, boasted a young adult-orientated pink and purple cover with a pretty Daenerys Stormborn and a cute child wielding a sword.

Dennis/Denise Lehane's Shutter Island, a stark psychological drama, now has a beautiful ocean view on the cover and is subtitled: 'A novel of self-discovery'.

Not quite as scary: Stephen King's horror masterpiece is wildly different in its new female-friendly incarnation

Many women writers feel their work is lumbered with patronising covers by publishers

Ms Johnson, the author of the Shades of London and the Suite Scarlett series, said: 'I do wish I had a dime for every email I get that says: "Please put a non-girly cover on your book so I can read it â€“ signed, A Guy".'

She even used one of her own covers as an example. The cover of Key to the Golden Firebird shows a neon pink background, an image of a beautiful teenage girl displaying her midriff, and features the words 'a novel' in a dark pink heart.

She told The Guardian: 'It's about three sisters who are dealing with the sudden death of their father. May, the middle sister, is trying to hold her family together and learn how to drive. This is the cover.'

She added: 'The simple fact of the matter is, if you are a female author, you are much more likely to get the package that suggests the book is of a lower perceived quality because it's "girly", which is somehow inherently different and easier on the palate.

'A man and a woman can write books about the same subject matter, at the same level of quality, and that woman is simply more likely to get the soft-sell cover with the warm glow and the feeling of smooth jazz blowing off of it.'

Amanda Hocking, the million-selling self-published novelist, blogged about the 'gender cover-up'.

She said: 'More women read books than men, more women write books then men, but only a small fraction of books that win literary awards are written by women.

'Women are the publishing industry's bread and butter, we are the backbone of the damn entertainment industry, but we are constantly demoted to "fluffy" to "light" to "meaningless".'

'I'm sick to death of this. I am so sick of the constant, blatant sexism. And any time any one points anything out as being sexist, they're accused of "whining" or "nagging" or "not taking a joke".'

British author Polly Courtney went so far as to drop her publisher after her third book, It's a Man's World, was given the tagline 'but it takes a woman to run it'.
