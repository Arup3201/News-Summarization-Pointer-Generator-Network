The Federal Aviation Administration says it will continue its ban on U.S. airline flights to Tel Aviv for an additional 24 hours while assessing the danger of rocket attacks.

The agency said Wednesday it is working closely with the Israeli government to review new information they have provided and to determine whether safety concerns have been resolved.

FAA instituted the flight prohibition on Tuesday in response to a rocket strike that landed about a mile from the airport.

Travel nightmare: Passengers queue for security control before departure at the Ben Gurion International airport in Tel Aviv as the FAA announced that it has extended its ban on U.S. commercial flights to Israel

The directive applies only to U.S. operators like Delta Airlines, US Airways and American Airlines, and has no authority over foreign airlines operating to or from the airport.

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg strongly urged the FAA to ‘reverse course’ and permit U.S. airlines to fly to Israel.

Bloomberg released a statement saying he is flying on El Al to Tel Aviv on Tuesday night to ‘show solidarity with the Israeli people and to demonstrate that it is safe to fly in and out of Israel.’

‘The U.S. flight restrictions are a mistake that hands Hamas an underserved victory and should be lifted immediately,’ Bloomberg said.

On his Flickr account Wednesday, the billionaire businessman shared photos taken during his meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres.

He also traveled to Jerusalem to visit the family of 24-year-old Sgt Max Steinberg, a volunteer soldier from Southern California who was killed in the Gaza Strip Sunday.

Two thumbs up: Bloomberg extolled the virtues of Israel's main airport, calling it the 'best protected airport in the world'

Mr Bloomberg met with the Steinbergs 
at the Crowne Plaza Hotel where they are observing the traditional 
mourning period, known as Shiva, following Wednesday morning's funeral 
on Mount Herzl.

Secretary of State John Kerry also defied the FAA
restriction Wednesday by flying into Ben Gurion in Tel Aviv to try and broker a
cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas, CBS News reported. 

America's top diplomat traveled aboard an Air Force jet a
day after the FAA issued a ban on commercial flights into Israel’s main airport.

Even before the ban, Delta Air Lines turned around one of
its jets midflight and indefinitely canceled all future flights between the
U.S. and Israel after a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip landed near Tel Aviv's
Ben-Gurion Airport.

Other U.S. airlines quickly took similar action, and
counterparts in Europe and Canada followed within hours, despite protests from
the Israeli government. Israeli airline El Al maintained its regular flight
schedule.

Germany's Lufthansa, Italian airline Alitalia and Air
France all acted before the European Aviation Safety Agency issued an advisory.

Scandinavian Airlines canceled two flights from Copenhagen
to Tel Aviv on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, and said it will rethink
the situation Wednesday for two more flights this week.

Budget airline Norwegian said it had scrapped a flight from
Stockholm to Tel Aviv on Wednesday and was monitoring the events closely, the
airline's spokeswoman Charlotte Holmbergh Jacobsson said.

Also Wednesday, Royal Jordanian suspended its flights to
Ben Gurion until further notice, according to the airline's spokesman, Basil
al-Kilani.

Korean Air Lines Co. said on Friday that it was suspending
its flights between Incheon International Airport near Seoul and Tel Aviv until
at least Thursday, citing tensions between Israel and Palestine.

Lufthansa and Air Berlin later extended their cancellations
through Thursday and Air France said it was suspending its flights 'until
further notice.'

The European Aviation Safety Agency said it 'strongly
recommends' that airlines refrain from operating flights to and from Tel Aviv.

It said it would 'monitor the situation and advise on any
update as the situation develops.'

All told, 160 flights at Ben Gurion were canceled as of
Wednesday, 80 incoming and 80 departing, Transportation Ministry director-general
Uzi Yitzhaki told Israel’s Channel 2.

Last year, an average of 1,044 passengers flew each way on
the four daily flights between the U.S. and Israel on American carriers,
according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

Jack Ram, 50, of Tel Aviv, who was in New York visiting
friends, said threats of violence and disruptions while traveling were nothing
new for Israelis. He prayed Tuesday before entering the departure area at
Newark, New Jersey, for his El Al flight to Israel.

‘We're used to it. That's how we live for the last 3,000 years
actually,’ Ram said.

Thousands of travelers have found themselves stranded as a
result of the flight restrictions, prompting Israel’s El Al, Arkia and Israair
airlines to pick up some of the slack by boosting service in and out of the
country.

As a result of the increased demand, prices on El Al tickets
have skyrocketed in the past 24 hours, drawing the ire of many stranded
passengers desperate to get home, according to Times of Israel. 

Among those who have found themselves stuck is a group of
25 high school students from the North American Federation of Temple Youth who
were supposed to return to the U.S. Tuesday after a two-week stay in a kibbutz.

‘We’re working minute by minute to try to reschedule them,
but in the meantime they’ll be housed in the kibbutz,’ Annette Powers, with the
Union for Reform Judaism, told the New York Times.

Transport Minister Yisrael Katz said 4,000 Israelis are also
currently stranded  in Istanbul.
