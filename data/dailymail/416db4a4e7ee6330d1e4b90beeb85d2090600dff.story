Prime Minister Tony Abbott has caused outrage among MPs less than a week after  surviving a leadership spill - this time for sacking veteran Liberal MP Philip Ruddock as his chief government whip.

Mr Abbott's move yesterday not only angered his backbench but could again risk the questioning of his leadership, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Some even went as far as describing Mr Abbott's decision as 'scapegoating of Godzilla proportions' amid claims the move was Mr Ruddock's punishment for not seeing off the leadership challenge, the ABC reports. 

Mr Ruddock is the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives, as he first elected to  for the seat of Parramatta at by-election in 1973. 

He went on to hold many titles, including the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs from 1996 to 2003 during John Howard's time in office.

Queensland MP Scott Buchholz will be taking over Mr Ruddock's position, which he has held since September 2013.

Queensland backbencher Andrew Laming publicly expressed his disapproval for Mr Abbott's decision, saying it was 'scapegoating of Godzilla proportions'.

'We really needed a week of healing, not wounding, and I think it really has set us back a fair bit particularly because Philip Ruddock was such a respected character,' Mr Laming told the ABC.

One backbencher, who has not been named, described Mr Abbott's decision on Friday afternoon as 'another disastrous call', the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'The PM had my vote on Monday even though he refused to get rid of Peta Credlin [the chief of staff],' another MP told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'He has now lost my vote because he had no right to get rid of Philip Ruddock.' 

Others told The Australian that Mr Abbott felt Mr Ruddock had not been supportive enough of the prime minister.

Mr Abbott however denied such claims, saying his decision was based on having 'a deeper and stronger engagement with the backbench and that means it was very important to renew and refresh the whips team'.

Mr Abbott's move to dump his chief whip on Friday not only angered his backbench but also risks the questioning of his leadership once again

In a statement released yesterday, Mr Abbott did not offer any reasoning behind his decision and instead thanked Mr Ruddock for his contribution.

'As Father of the House, Philip has given over four decades of service to the Australian Parliament and the Australian people. He was a senior minister throughout the life of the Howard government and was shadow cabinet secretary in opposition. Later this year, he will become the second longest serving parliamentarian in our history. No one has done more than Philip helping immigrants to feel at home in their new country and helping members of migrant communities to participate in our national life,' the prime minister said.

'I look forward to his future contribution to the government and to our country. He remains an important counsellor for Coalition members of parliament and will continue to serve as Member for Berowra with distinction.

'These changes will be in place for the next parliamentary sitting period.'

This comes nearly a week after Mr Abbott asked his chief whip at the time, Mr Ruddock, to call a special Party Room meeting for 9am on Monday February 9 to consider the spill motion.

The announcement was made on Sunday, just after Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull praised Mr Abbott for holding the ballot on Tuesday to give his colleagues time to discuss the matter on Monday before casting their vote.

The prime minister held onto his leadership after 61 MPs voted against a spill motion and 39 for it. 

But soon after surviving the spill, Mr Abbott came under fire after he described job losses under the Labor government as a 'holocaust of jobs' in parliament on Thursday. 

Mr Abbott subsequently apologised and withdrew the comment. He replaced the word 'holocaust' with 'decimation'.
