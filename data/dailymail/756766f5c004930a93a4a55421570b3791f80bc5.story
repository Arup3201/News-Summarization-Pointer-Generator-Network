Syrian rebels prepare to unleash their latest improvised weapon in their desperate struggle against the Assad regime - a homemade rocket launcher constructed from salvaged pipe firing projectiles made from domestic gas canisters.

The conflict, which has been raging for two years and nine months, has seen fighters from the Free Syria Army deploying increasingly effective locally-made weapons against the far better equipped Government forces.

Their latest device, which resembles a mortar, appears to have been bodged together from salvaged piping and metal struts. It fires rockets constructed from domestic gas canisters.

A group of rebels were today pictured preparing to fire the device from a position in Old Aleppo, which has been the seen of a prolonged government offensive in recent weeks.

Rebel fighters have employed an array of improvised weapons during the conflict including giant catapults firing home-made hand-grenades, armoured cars, and a mortar fired with a PlayStation games console controller.

Today Syrian warplanes carried out air strikes near the Lebanese border, wounding at least 10 people who were rushed to hospital in a nearby Lebanese town, Beirut's state-run National News Agency said.

The agency said the bombing hit near Arsal, where thousands of Syrians have fled to escape their country's civil war over the past months.

The state news agency did not say whether the bombing occurred on Lebanese territory. But the area they mentioned, Jroud Arsal, refers to the barren rugged hills east of the town that are within Lebanon.

Two Arsal residents said a wounded woman brought to the town after Wednesday's air raid had died. They said three others are in critical condition. The residents spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety.

Arsal is on the other side of Syria's rugged Qalamoun region where the government has been on the offensive for weeks, capturing a number of towns and villages in the area.

Military officials were not immediately available for comment. The Lebanese army did not respond to the shelling.

On Monday, the Lebanese army fired on Syrian aircraft that violated the country's airspace. It was the first time Lebanon had defended its borders from Syria's military since the uprising broke out nearly three years ago.

Syrian forces often chase rebels sneaking in and out of Lebanon. Communities on the Lebanese side of the border dominated by Sunni Muslims have become safe havens for rebels battling the rule of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

It is one way that the Syrian conflict has been expanding into Lebanon. The conflict has exacerbated tensions between Lebanon's Sunni and Shiite Muslims, and prompted shadowy groups to conduct attacks that have killed dozens this year.

Also Wednesday, state media and activists reported heavy clashes in the Damascus suburb of Adra, part of which was stormed by rebels last month.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said opposition fighters battled with troops from Assad's army as well as pro-government militias known as the National Defense Forces and fighters from Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group. Hezbollah started openly backing Assad's forces in May.

The Observatory said a number of government forces were killed as well as two Hezbollah fighters. State TV said 21 rebels were killed in the latest fighting in Adra. Such conflicting death tolls are common.

Electricity meanwhile was cut off in the entire northern province of Aleppo due to a "terrorist" attack against main power lines, the state news agency SANA said. Syrian state media refer to rebels as terrorists.

Attacks on the country's infrastructure have occurred periodically since Syria's crisis began in March 2011. More than 130,000 people have been killed so far in the war, now in its third year, according to the Observatory.

The group closely monitors the violence in Syria through a network of activists across the country. The U.N. said in July that 100,000 Syrians have been killed, and has not updated that figure since.
