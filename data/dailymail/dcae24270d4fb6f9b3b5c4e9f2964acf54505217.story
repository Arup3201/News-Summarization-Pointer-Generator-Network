Australian universities are in the good books with eight tertiary institutions now ranked inside the world's top 200 - but there are warnings that the planned deregulation of fees could threaten the standard of the nation's education system.

Australia has increased its representation in the 2014-15 Times Higher Education World University rankings, with most of the nation's top institutions improving their standings on last year.

Melbourne University is still leading the local pack, climbing one spot from last year to be in 33rd place, ahead of the Australian National University (45) and University of Sydney (60).

University of Melbourne has moved into 33rd spot and is best of the Australian tertiary institutions but the UK based report warns that the proposed deregulation of fees could sorely test the depth of Australian unis 

Adelaide University is a new entrant to the top 200, moving ahead almost 40 places to 164.

Time Higher Education (THE) is a weekly UK magazine (formerly newspaper) and website, which has been reporting on issues specific to higher education for almost 50 years. Its annual world rankings have been in place for more than a decade.

Of Australia's eight universities in the top 200, only fourth-ranked Queensland University lost ground in the latest standings.

Time Higher Education World University Rankings editor Phil Baty said the improvement, and the fact another 12 Australian universities were ranked in the 200 to 400 bracket, provides evidence of a world class university system.

'It's a really impressive performance,' Mr Baty said.

'I think the great thing for Australia is they've got great strength in depth.

'It's not just the eight in the top 200 but below the 200 there's a really healthy group of really interesting universities.'

California Institute of Tech (US)    1 (1)

Harvard University (US)                2 (2)

University of Oxford (UK)              3 (2)

Stanford University (US)               4 (4)

University of Cambridge (UK)       5 (7)

Massachusetts Inst of Tech (US)  6 (5)

Princeton University (US)              7 (6)

Uni of California, Berkeley (US)    8 (8)

Imperial College London (UK)     9 (10)

Yale University (US)                    9 (11)

While Australia's overall improvement was slight, Mr Baty said it could reflect the fact universities were making significant contributions in research, leading the world in international student recruitment and becoming more aware and strategic about global brand awareness.

However, while he lauded the universities, Mr Baty issued a note of caution about Australia's future in tertiary studies. 

He said the government's plans to deregulate tuition fees from 2016 could reshape the landscape in the coming years.

'The big question is whether this admirable strength-in-depth can be maintained,' Mr Baty said.

'The reforms may help a small Australian elite protect or even improve their global standing, but what about the rest? It may mean the second-tier institutions are weakened.

'There is a lot at stake over the next few years.'

The Australian National University remains the nation's second ranked Australian institution (up three spots to 45th overall) followed by Sydney University, which climbed several spots to be 60th.

University of Sydney ranks third of the Australian institutions, with eight of them in the world's top 200 including new addition in the University of Adelaide. The US and UK dominate the top 10

California Institute of Technology held on to the world's top ranking for the fourth straight year ahead of Harvard University, with the US filling seven of the top 10 spots.

The UK holds the other three, led by third-placed Oxford.

Leading Asian institutions continue to rise with 24 universities in the top 200, an increase of 20 on last year. Best of the Asian schools is the University of Tokyo, in 23rd.

The annual rankings index uses 13 objective performance indicators, including industry income, teaching, research influence and international outlook.
