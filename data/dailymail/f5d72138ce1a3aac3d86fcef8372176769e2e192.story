Almost 300 customers are deserting the Co-op Bank every working day due to a ‘hurricane of bad publicity’, its boss admitted yesterday.

The bank’s near-collapse and a sex and drugs scandal involving former chairman Paul Flowers have proved the final straw for tens of thousands of savers.

In the first half of the year, 37,921 people switched their current accounts away from the Co-op, which attracted just 9,722 new customers. 

Drought: The loss of 300 customers a day is thought to be the biggest in the bank's 141-year history

The loss is thought to be the biggest in the bank’s 141-year history.

Chief executive Niall Booker described the loss of each customer as a ‘mortal wound’, but said he had expected even more to defect after the bank’s ‘hurricane of negative publicity’.

He pointed out that the desertions still accounted for less than 2 per cent of their current account customers.

The comments came as the bank revealed it made a £76million loss in the first half of the year, much less severe than the £845million loss incurred in the same period last year. 

This was largely due to a drop in losses from bad loans, and a smaller bill for wrongdoing. 

Scandal: It comes after the bank's near-collapse and the expose of Paul Flowers' sex and drugs scandal

But they went on to reveal that the bank would still be vulnerable if there was ‘an unusually high level of withdrawals’ as it is so reliant on deposits from customers.

James Daley, a consumer campaigner and founder of website Fairer Finance, said: ‘The results suggest the business is a complete basket case and give very little cause for optimism. 

'I cannot see any good reason why a customer would want to move their account to the Co-op.’

However in an appeal to customers, Mr Booker claimed the Co-op is an ‘ethical’ bank. 

He said: ‘The Co-operative has a valuable role to play providing customers with a different choice, set apart as it is by the values and ethics that remain a key reason why customers choose to bank with us.’
