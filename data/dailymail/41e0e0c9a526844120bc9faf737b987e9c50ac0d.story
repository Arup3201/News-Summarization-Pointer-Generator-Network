It was previously reported that Kim and Kanye were planning to have a ceremony in America, as wel as a further two in France, after their lawyers allegedly recommended a US wedding to avoid any legal issues.

A source said: 'Typically, the U.S. recognizes citizens getting married in 
France, but dealing with a foreign government and paperwork could be a 
nightmare.

‘So just to make sure it’s legal, Kim and Kanye will first be having a civil ceremony in Southern California.’

The 
couple’s wedding plans were almost scuppered last month when they 
discovered that French law requires at least one of them to remain in 
France for at least 40 days before the wedding.

Main venue: According to reports, one of the pair's French weddings will take place at Chateau de Louveciennes just outside Paris

Although
 Kanye has owned an apartment in the city for three years, it's not his 
main home and so the local mayor will make the final decision.

At
 the time a source told Radar: ‘Kim and Kanye were unaware until 
recently that France required a residency requirement prior to the 
marriage. Kanye has an apartment in Paris, but he doesn’t live there 
full time.’

And the 
French Embassy in Washington D.C confirmed the law saying: ‘All 
marriages must be performed by a French civil authority before any 
religious ceremony takes place. The mayor can authorise the deputy mayor
 or a city councillor to perform the ceremony in the town in which one 
of the parties to be married has resided for at least 40 days preceding 
the marriage. 

'These requirements cannot be waived.'

Bridesmaid to be: Kim and Kanye's daughter North is expected to have a starring role in all the ceremonies

Their
 main wedding – which is rumoured to be held at Louis XIV-commissioned 
Chateau de Louveciennes – is expected to be an extravagant affair.

It’s
 thought Kim will have at least three outfit changes on the big day, 
with Azzedine Alaia expected to be one of the designers.

However, in an interview in February, Kim admitted she had changed her mind about what she wanted on her big day and was keen to have a smaller do.

She said: 'We're having a super, super small, intimate wedding. As we go along, we're realizing we want it to be smaller and more intimate than people are imagining and thinking.'

MailOnline has contacted a representative for Kim for comment.
