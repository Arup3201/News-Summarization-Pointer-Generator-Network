Derryn Hinch is back. 20 years after he last hosted his own program, the broadcaster dubbed 'The Human Headline' will front a current affairs show on Pay-TV channel Sky News.

And it'll be the tried and tested no-holds-barred Hinch approach, which has served him well over the years .. and also landed him in hot water.

'It feels pretty good,I do enjoy the stuff I do at the moment but to have your own program again, it has been 20 years since the Hinch program,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday.

'They approached me'. Derryn Hinch will become a host of his own current affairs show again, Hinch Live on Sky news, some 20 years after his last program was shelved by Network Ten

Hinch's recent career has been dominated by radio  and appearances on the Sunrise program on Channel Seven, while also filling in on Sky News for other presenters

Hinch is the first to admit he's made plenty of his own headlines, aside from reporting on those in them.

He has battled liver cancer, was given little hope by doctors but underwent a transplant three years ago.

He reportedly found love again at age 70, with with former detective Natasha Chadwick, 36 years his junior.

But it is his professional career which has been colourful and controversial, to the extreme. 

In 1987, he served a short time in jail for revealing details of an alleged paedophile priest's prior conviction during a trial. He was then placed under house arrest for five weeks in 2011 for breaching suppression orders on the names of sex offenders, as a consequence of his belief that the public have ‘a right to know’ who they are.

And he was forced to spend his birthday last year behind bars in Victoria's Langi Kal Kal Prison. The shock jock jailed for 50 days for failing to pay a court fine of $100,000 imposed on him for breaching another suppression order, this time relating to Jill Meagher's killer.

The veteran broadcaster has been jailed twice and placed under house arrest on another occasion for breaking contempt of court and breaking suppression orders

Derryn Hinch has always argued for the public's right to know. Here the broadcaster held a news conference outside the State Law building in Brisbane in July last year after meeting with Queensland's attorney-general to discuss his proposal to introduce a US-style sex offender register

But he hasn't changed and won't be changing, Hinch promised.

'It will be a fair bit of the old Hinch (style) and a touch of Larry King in there too with a lot more interviews and a bit of entertainment,' he said.

'Remember that I hosted the Midday Show, did a lot of showbiz and spoke with a lot of authors, getting a guest on the set on a Saturday night will be interesting.

'They (Sky News) approached me, I wasn’t out there shopping for a job.

'Two shows on a weekend will be a challenge, we all know that Saturday night is a wasteland on TV but that is the challenge for me.

'Saturday night, especially, will be hard core, plenty of people have said to me "oh, it will be great I have nothing to watch on Saturday night" so we’ll see what happens.

'It won't be as political as the other stuff on Sky News, which is so politically skewed with panellists, I am just putting it together, a work in progress and I have already been bumped from the planned opening program because of the Queensland election.'

Anyone thinking he may be getting soft in his slightly advanced age, would be sadly mistaken.

'Just because it’s the weekend I'm not going to be suddenly become the homogenised version of Hinch,' he said.

'I got into trouble recently when I was filling in when I said that Tony Abbott walks as if as it he's got Haemorrhoids - I speak my mind and I am too old to change and not interested in changing.

'There won't be this makeover thing, it's just me.

'I've got a new venue, they (Sky News) are very committed, I'm in a brand new studio at Southbank.

'It's Melbourne based but not Melbourne-centric.'

He says the hunger for news and current affairs is still there, 55 years after beginning as a cadet on the Taranaki Herald in New Zealand. The other challenge will be to get the big names to open up and find up and comers to interview.

'Two shows on a weekend will be a challenge, we all know that Saturday night is a wasteland on TV but that is the challenge for me,' Hinch admitted

'When you’ve been around a long time, it's a big advantage, you have a sense of history,' he told DMA.

'The GST, for example, I remember raising it with Kerry Packer before (John) Howard brought it in and I told KP that I supported it and he said "you're f***ing mad" and went on to tell me why and he was righ about some other taxes and all the promises that weren’t kept.

'It's those sorts of anecdotes and experiences I can draw on.

'They (interesting characters) are still out there, I must say, and I do admit the better stoushes did come with the older pollies like Bob Hawke and Paul Keating.

'Hawke would revoke your insults sarcastically, delivering a Darren or a Darryl in his response,' he said, delivering an almost perfect Bob Hawke impersonation in making the point.

'But Keating, was so smart, he was actually charismatic. Women would flock to Paul Keating when he walked into a room, he wasn't all just Zegna suits.'

Politics will not be the dominant subject, for fear of turning viewers off on the tricky Saturday night programming.

'I won't be heavily political and when we can, it will be about the week that was as well, it’s a work in progress.'

Daily Mail Australia found him in quite jovial mood and when asked who he would like to line up as guests for the early shows, Hinch quipped: 'Obama on the first show and the Pope on the second.'

He's back. 

Hinch says he's always ready to go toe-to-toe with the biggest names. 'They (interesting characters) are still out there. Bob Hawke would revoke your insults sarcastically, delivering a Darren or a Darryl in his response but Keating was so smart, he was actually charismatic. Women would flock to Paul Keating when he walked into a room, he wasn't all just Zegna suits.'
