A Tennessee man has pleaded not guilty to killing the great-niece of late country music singer Johnny Cash.

Wayne Masciarella, 27, entered the plea Wednesday during a brief court appearance in Putnam County.

Police say Masciarella stabbed 23-year-old Courtney Cash to death after getting into an argument with her and her boyfriend.

Cash's body was found March 19 inside a wooden box at her home in Baxter. Her boyfriend, William Austin Johnson, also suffered stab wounds.

A motive has not been released, but 
Putnam County Sheriff David Andrews has indicated the stabbings were 
likely connected to drugs.

The
 Tennessean reports that Masciarella's court-appointed attorney Doug 
Dennis intends to file a motion next week that would keep news cameras 
out of the courtroom.

'The cameras make it a "Law & Order" episode,' Dennis said. 'Talk about tainting a jury pool.'

The suspect is being held without bond in the Putnam County Jail.

Meanwhile, Courtney Cash's funeral took place Wednesday morning in Cookeville.

According to The Tennessean, her obituary called her 'a loving mother, daughter, granddaughter, and friend.'

The 23-year-old's body was discovered
 last Wednesday morning in a home near Cookeville, about 70 miles east 
of Nashville.

She was found in a chest just inside the front door, Andrews said. Cash's 
boyfriend was treated for stab wounds at Vanderbilt University 
Medical Center in Nashville.

Crime scene: The murder took place inside Cash and Johnson's duplex on rice Road in Cookeville, Tennessee

Andrews said the couple had gone out with a friend before an altercation took place in the house on Rice Road where Johnson and Cash lived with their 20-month-old daughter.

The friend, identified as Masciarella, 26, was later charged with first-degree murder.

Despite being stabbed multiple times, Johnson was able to get out of the house with his daughter and drive himself to the hospital, Andrews said.Â 

The scene inside the house was 'somewhat bloody,' Andrews told reporters at a news conference.

'There was a struggle,' the sheriff added.

According to an arrest warrant for Masciarella obtained by Herald-Citizen, investigators claim he stabbed Cash with a kitchen knife at around 10.40am and then hid her body in a chest in a bid to cover up the crime.

The box was described as coffee-table size case measuring 4 feet by 1.5 feet and 2 feet deep, according to NewsChannel5.

A motive was not released, but Andrews indicated the stabbings were likely connected to drugs.

'This
 is a senseless, tragic death of a young lady whose life was probably 
taken as a direct or indirect result of drugs,' Andrews said.

Johnny Cash's brother, Tommy Cash, released a statement asking for prayers for the family after the loss of his granddaughter.

'Courtney
 and her boyfriend are beloved members of my family and like you we have
 a lot of questions and emotions that we are beginning to sort through 
today,' he said in the statement posted on Facebook.

'We ask for you to respect our privacy and appreciate all the support that the public and media has always offered my family, as we handle the loss of my grand-daughter, pray for the father of my great-grand child and journey through the search for justice on this violent act.

'We are completely heartbroken. It is a time like this that we are grateful for our faith and trusting the loving guidance of God.'

The man has a vast criminal history, 
with 20 arrests in Putnam County alone. As recently as last month, the 
26-year-old was charged with theft of merchandise and released on $500 
bond.
