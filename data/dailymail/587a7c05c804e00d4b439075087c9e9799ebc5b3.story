A homeless Marine who died of terminal cancer received his dying wish to be buried in a uniform he could never afford to own.

Donnie Loneman, 59, had been living on the streets of Oklahoma City for the last decade when doctors gave him three weeks to live. 

Loneman, who had loved being a Marine, asked for three things: to be buried in dress blues, with a 'high and tight' Marine haircut and a corps flag for his casket.

Donnie Loneman, a homless Marine who had been living on the streets of Oklahoma City for the last decade, requested that he be buried in dress blues after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer 

Loneman, 59, also asked to be given a Marine 'high and tight' haircut and to be buried with the corps flag 

The Oklahoma City Veterans Affair Medical Center put the word out and a number of veteran organizations banded together to make Loneman's wish come true. 

A flag and the dress blues were donated, and the foundations also paid for Loneman's funeral expenses and gave him an honor guard for his burial, according to KOCO-TV. 

Loneman, who was Native American, was beloved by the local veteran affairs organization, who knew him to have 'a good heart' and a 'great sense of humor'. 

'We get guys like him once in a blue moon, who really make a difference for everyone here,' said Christine Cleary, who worked with the medical center.

The Oklahoma City Veterans Affair put the word out and a number of veteran organizations banded together to make Loneman's wish come true. His funeral was also paid for and he received an honor guard for his burial 

Even as the organization fought to get Loneman off the street, he would say the aid should be given to a veteran who needed more help than him.

As one friend recalled in a letter, Loneman had grit. When she worried about him living out in the cold he simply responded that Marines are tough.

'We can take it,' she recalled him saying. 'We can take anything.' 

Loneman wasn't even afraid of death. He told Cleary he was happy because he knew he was going to heaven, where he would get to see his mother and the Marines.

'He said "I'm going to enter the gates, and I'm going to tell all the Marines that are standing there that they're relieved of their duty, and I'm going to take their place"', Cleary recalled him saying. 

'And I'll stand there until my arm gets tired, and another Marine comes.'
