A former director of the English National Ballet and notoriously demanding choreographer asked his star dancer to consider aborting her unborn child, it has emerged.

When prima ballerina Daria Klimentova told Derek Deane OBE she was pregnant he made it clear it was 'an inconvenience', the Czech dancer claims in her autobiography.

'I was happily married and approaching 30, and yet he asked me immediately, "Are you going to keep it?"' she writes.

Ms Klimentova, who went on to have a daughter, says she was 'amazed' by the reaction of Mr Deane, himself a former principal dancer and a friend of both Diana, Princess of Wales, and Princess Margaret.

At the time of the incident in 2000, the artistic director had been planning to cast rising star Ms Klimentova, now 41, as the lead in the English National Ballet production of Sleeping Beauty, a report in the Daily Telegraph said.

'I suppose that I shouldn't have been so shocked... To him, this child was an inconvenience and he showed it,' writes the ballerina, adding that Mr Deane, now 59, was 'irritated' that she would not be able to perform as planned.

Speaking to MailOnline today, Ms Klimentova said she had 'absolutely no regrets' about her decision to have a child at the peak of her dancing career.

'Absolutely not,' she said, adding: 'Maybe I regret that I didn't have another one.'

She recalled being nervous upon approaching Mr Deane to tell him her news, but added that the prospect of 'any conversation' with the tough task-master was a source of nerves for dancers in the company.

The ballerina said she did not feel any anger towards the choreographer for his reaction to her pregnancy in 2000.

'No I wasn't really angry,' she said. 'I was very happy to be pregnant.

'Nobody put any pressure on me, I came back three months after... it was completely my decision.'

The dancer claims in her book Agony 
And Ecstacy: My Life In Dance that she told Mr Deane she still wanted 
the role of Aurora, even though she would be four months pregnant at the
time, but that the choreographer opted to cast a different ballerina.

Mr
Deane, who was artistic director of the English National Ballet from 
1993 to 2001, and remains a freelance choreographer for the company, has
admitted asking Ms Klimentova whether it was the 'right time' to have a
child, but insists he did not make 'any demand' that she terminate her 
pregnancy.

He told the 
Guardian newspaper he recalled asking her what she really wanted, and 
telling her she had to be 'very sure' a baby was what she wanted.

But he added: 'There was no way I was making any demand to Daria to terminate her pregnancy'.

Ms Klimentova returned to the English National Ballet just a week after having her baby, and was back on stage as prima ballerina three months later.

In her book she says she feared she was 'done at ENB' after the incident, but that Mr Deane 'bore no grudge towards me whatsoever'.

The ballerina remains principal dancer at the company today.

Mr Deane stepped down from his post as the English National Ballet's artistic director in 2001 following allegations he had harassed a male dancer. At the time he declined to comment.

He remained with the company on a freelance basis and starred alongside Ms Klimentova in a BBC documentary on the English National Ballet in 2011.

An English National Ballet spokesman told MailOnline today that Mr Deane is out of the country and does not wish to make any further comment.
