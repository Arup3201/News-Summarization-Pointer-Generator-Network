Police say a four-year-old boy taken from a playground in Baden, Lower Austria, has been found safe and well in the Channel Islands after a three-day search.

Caspar Ruggaber had gone missing on Monday when his multimillionaire British father turned up unexpectedly at the mother's address in Baden, and asked to see his son.

Police today confirmed that Caspar had been found safe and well in Guernsey.

They are understood to be questioning the father, Stefan Gomoll, and his lawyer.

The boy has joint German and British nationality, and both passports were with his mother, Dominique Ruggaber, when he was seized.

It is not clear how the father managed to get the boy into the Channel Islands without a passport.

Britta Schönhart, a lawyer for the boy's mother said that she was 'of course' pleased the child had been found safe and well.

'Arrangements are now being made for the mother to travel over to Guernsey,' she said. 'We are hoping that the case will have a positive conclusion.'

The boy and his mother had been living on the Channel Island of Sark, where Mr. Gomoll is a member of the Finance and Commerce Committee.

They moved to Baden to be near her parents when she broke up from Mr Gomoll in April 2012.

In February 2013, however, the two had returned to Sark, but went back to Baden in August after Mr Gomoll threatened to put Caspar in boarding school.

Austrian police had said the father had turned up unexpectedly at the mother's address in Baden on Monday, and asked to see his son.

The mother agreed, saying he could take the boy to the park, but only on the condition the boy's grandfather accompany them.

Mr Gomoll and the boy vanished when the grandfather used the toilet.

A legal source connected to the case said Austrian police had applied for a Europe-wide arrest warrant.
