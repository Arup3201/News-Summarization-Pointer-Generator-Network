Amed Pelle, 18, used Facebook to incite violence

A teenager who used Facebook to encourage the 'killing of a million police officers' during the riots has been jailed for 33 months.

Amed Pelle incited his 2,000 friends on the site to commit violence and looting in Nottingham.

He asked if any of them 'wanted anything' from a fashion store that was later targeted.

The jobless 18-year-old posted three messages on his Facebook 'wall' on August 9, hours before serious disorder broke out in his home city.

The first two read 'Nottz Riot whose onit?' and 'Kill one black youth, we kill a million Fedz (police), riot til we own cities'. It is believed the second message was a reference to Mark Duggan, whose death in Tottenham sparked the original trouble.

In his third message, Pelle wrote: 'Rioting 2nyt anyone want anything from (fashion chain) Flannels?' The store, in Nottingham city centre, had its windows smashed hours later.

Pelle had pleaded guilty to a breach of section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2007, doing an act which was capable of encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence, namely violent disorder.Â 

Judge John Milmo told Pelle that his comments 'encouraged attacks on the people of Nottingham as a whole, and the people of other cities.'

Sentencing the teenager to two years and nine months in a young offenders' institution, he added: 'Your offence was designed to, and could well have led to, increased numbers on the street intent on violence to persons and property.

'An element of deterrence is called for in cases like this. A clear signal needs to be sent out that criminal conduct of the kind demonstrated in these cases is out of order and will not be brushed under the carpet.'

Ice cream thief: Anderson Fernandes, 21, was jailed - despite giving away his ice cream after just one lick

His sentence came as a looter who took just one lick of an ice cream he stole during rioting before he gave it away was jailed for 16 months.

Anderson Fernandes, 21, wandered into an upmarket store in central Manchester after the door was left open and helped himself to a cone and two scoops.

But despite giving it to a passer-by because he didn't like the coffee flavour he was still given a lengthy prison term.

The sentence will fuel fears that courts are meting out disproportionate justice to those caught up in the disorder.

Callum Marley, 20, was also locked up for 16 months in Manchester despite stealing nothing from a looted store.

He crawled under ransacked shutters at a Cash Generator pawnbrokers yet left empty handed when he found nothing worth taking - because everything had been taken already.

Figures last week showed that rioters were getting sentences which were '40 per cent longer' than people found guilty of equivalent offences.

As the clampdown continues, Scotland Yard revealed today that over 2,000 people have been held in connection with rioting in London.

Yesterday Manchester Crown Court was told that ice cream thief Fernandes, 21, was arrested after raiding Patisserie Valerie because he left DNA behind at the scene.

He admitted burglary and an unconnected charge of handling a stolen vacuum cleaner after his arrest.

The court heard that Fernandes had already appeared in court charged with possessing drugs and an offensive weapon on the same day he got mixed up in the disorder.

Michael McQuillan, defending, said: 'He is remorseful and fully accepts how serious the matter was and why courts take such a serious view of this type of behaviour.

A looter was picked out from a mob because he was wearing a distinctive Batman jumper, a court heard.

Benjamin King, 20, was jailed for 16 months after admitting burglary from a central Manchester clothes store.

He took a 
rucksack and another branded bag - 
handing one of them over to a looter who couldn't carry what he had 
stolen.

Adrian Palmer, defending, told Manchester Crown Court the defendant had gone into the city centre with 'inquisitive rather than malicious' 
intent, and had made no attempt to evade responsibility for the 
'wrongdoing' which followed.

Judge Michael Henshell, sentencing, said: 
'The cases we have heard today illustrate this with perfect clarity. 
Items as trivial as ice cream cones, handbags and T-shirts.

'Looked at in
 isolation the theft or handling of property such as this could be 
described as low-level offending.

'However, crowds are composed of 
individuals playing a part, large or small. This results in others being
 drawn in and becoming part of the general offending, thereby making the
 situation worse.'

'It's not the fact of the offence he committed, it's the fact he's committed it in circumstances where there's public disorder.'

Fernandes, from Newton Heath, was among a group of young men who appeared at Manchester Crown Court yesterday charged over the riots.

The court was told that Marley, who fled a Cash Generator store empty-handed, was caught after cutting himself on glass as he tried to find something worth taking.

Andrew Evans, defending, said: 
'He stood and watched for about ten minutes as people left the store 
with all sorts of electrical items and went in in the same amoral, 
unthinking manner in which people in a mob do.

'He clambered in, cut 
himself on the glass. He'd left it far too late - he left with nothing.'

A man who was so drunk he forgot he had been on a riot was jailed for two years at the same court.

Dean Millers, 21, from Salford, left a fingerprint on a camera case at Jessops in central Manchester and blood on a cigarette cupboard.

Paul Lamb, defending, said: 'He can't recall handling
 the camera box, but accepts he entered the premises and entered to 
steal, although he did not carry out the theft itself.

'He can't recall 
taking cigarettes but accepts he may well have done so.'

Also jailed was an amateur footballer who smashed his way into a shoe store with an iron bar.

Stalybridge Celtic player Fabrice Bembo-Leta, 19, lost his place in the squad after raiding the Foot Asylum outlet in central Manchester.

After getting into the store he grabbed 
five T-shirts, dropped two, and stashed three in a nearby plant pot. The churchgoer 
abandoned them after police approached, but was linked to his crime by 
CCTV.

Tough sentences: Lengthy jail terms were handed out at Manchester Crown Court to looters - including ice cream thief Anderson Fernandes, 21, and Callum Marley, 21, who was sent to prison despite having stolen nothing

Bembo-Leta, who has also played for Oldham and Altrincham FC's youth teams, had no previous convictions.

He was jailed for 32 months after admitting burglary.

Michael Brady, defending, said: 'He's
 not a young man known to police who knew it would be inevitable that he
 would be identified, neither is it the situation that he was under any 
pressure from family to surrender.

'This was very much a decision taken 
by a remarkably mature 19-year-old, probably a reflection not only on 
him but also his family and the way he has been brought up.'

A teenager who hoped to become a famous actor was also jailed after looting a Sainsbury's store in central Manchester.

Drama student Joshua Penney, 17, told a judge he 'felt like scum' after raiding the store.

Michael Fairhead, also 17, was also detained after he was collared in the early hours, carrying two stolen bottles of gin. Both had come into Manchester that night out of 'curiosity', the court heard.

Penney was given an eight-month detention and training order after stealing cigarettes and will serve half in a young offenders' institution.

When District Judge Jonathan Taaffe asked
 him how he felt after seeing news coverage of the devastation, Penney 
replied: 'It made me feel like I was scum.

'The things that happened 
made me feel so little and worthless.'

The defendant, who has no 
previous convictions, added: 'I hope to become an actor. A very 
successful actor.'

Fairhead, who admitted handling stolen goods, was jailed for eight months.

The teenagers can both be named because reporting restrictions were lifted as the judge ruled naming them was in the public interest.
