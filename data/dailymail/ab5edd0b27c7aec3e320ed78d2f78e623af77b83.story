New York LaGuardia has been named as the most frustrating airport in the US and Canada.

Taking into account the time it takes to get there, the security processes, the quality of the terminals and facilities, and how many flights get delayed, LaGuardia takes the crown it doesn't want.

Around 3,000 frequent flyers gave their opinions on 36 airports in the US and Canada; the 25 busiest US airports are listed as well as six of the seven busiest in Canada.

The research, conducted by businessweek.com, used data from a user survey, airports' on-time performance, and information on the ease of getting to and from the airports.

There wasn't much separating the top two overall most frustrating airports; New York LaGuardia scored a whopping 91 out of 100 on the scoring, while in second place came Newark Liberty International with 90.1.

Vancounver International was the least frustrating airport to travel from in the research conducted

BloombergBusinessweek report that LaGuardia has 'crowded gate areas with miniature, foul restrooms and a lack of convenient transportation access. No subway gets near it, leaving taxis, buses and pricey private car services as the main public options to get there. 

'Arriving at LaGuardia at certain times of the day means taxi lines a mile long.'

Customers have also taken to Twitter to voice their own discontent with LaGuardia.

Kirs wrote: 'LaGuardia Airport should literally be embarrassed that they still exist,' while Sarah Rem added: 'What bad karma wound me up in the only concourse in LaGuardia airport without a bar...' 

Meanwhile at the other end of the scale, Vancouver International took the title of the least frustrating airport, scoring only 17.6. In second spot at the right end of the listings was Portland Oregon International with 18.4.
