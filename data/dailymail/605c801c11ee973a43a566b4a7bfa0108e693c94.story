According to police the man was standing on top of the wood chipper and trimming trees. 

Local news footage from the scene showed the portable wood chipper parked behind a truck bearing a logo for Phoenix Trim-A-Tree, a tree pruning service.

'It's the type of wood chipper where the chute end actually will push the debris into the back of the truck so it can handle large branches,' Detective Seth Tyler said.

'It's extremely powerful.' 

Grieving family members said the landscaper had worked for the company for years and had plenty of experience.

The victim's daughter-in-law described him as a 'happy man who loved his family'.

Brenda Zapata told KTVK: 'We're never going to see his smiling face one more time. 

A straw hat lay on the ground next to the wood chipper. 

Local company Trim-A-Tree confirmed the man was an employee but declined to comment further.

In June a Florida man died after falling into a giant wood chipper. 

Hernan Gutierrez, 42, was working with two other men near a Davie home when he somehow ended up inside the machine.

It then pulled his entire body through and instantly killed him, police said. 

Police arriving at the scene were horrified and needed grief counselors to cope, according to reports.
