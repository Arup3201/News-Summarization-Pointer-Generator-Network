It was three decades since they last appeared on stage together, and tickets cost upwards of £75 a head, but the Monty Python crew had no trouble packing the O2 with fans last night.

Monty Python Live (mostly) - so named because one of the original group, Graham Chapman, died 25 years ago - was organised, as the septuagenarian comedians happily admitted, to 'make a lot of money' for them.

John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones performed most of the old favourites, from the Four Yorkshiremen sketch to a singalong of Always Looks On The Bright Side, and many of the diehard fans turned up in Python fancy dress.

Critics - many of whom definitely 
remembered the jokes from the first time around - mostly raved about it,
 but many fans took to Twitter to complain about what one called 'Monty 
Python's Dying Circus'.

Monty Python is back: But not everyone was impressed by the opening night show at London's O2

The show contained all the old favourites, including the dead parrot sketch with Michael Palin and John Cleese

'Tired, pretty rubbish': This critical tweet was typical of many reports of last night's opening show in London

Monty Python's Dying Circus: Many people complained that the jokes seemed tired and no longer as funny

'Stuff for money': Monty Python fans were encouraged to buy merchandise, including a £15 babygro

One, Luke Skipper, wrote: 'OK, going to say it, Monty Python looked tired, pretty rubbish, with super awkward fans.'

Twitter user Wayne wrote: 'I don't care what people think BUT Monty Python are s****.  Not funny.  It's just a bunch of skint old men trying to make a few quid.  #bored.'

Peadar Ailean wrote of last night's opening show in a run of ten: 'Am I alone in thinking the reformed Monty Python shows aren't quite as madcap, offbeat, and rib-ticklingly funny as is being made out?'

And an Australian writer said the ageing comedians had 'made a hefty withdrawal from their reputation bank', adding 'There were, predictably, dead parrots.'

Mick Jagger has called the surviving Pythons 'a bunch of wrinkly old men trying to relive their youth', while The Mail's Quentin Letts (see below for full review) went even further, saying: 'Five tuxedo'd old geezers, necks like tortoises, creaked and croaked through a patchy night of their greatest hits.

Don't hold back: Writing on Twitter, Wayne referred to the comedians' desire to make more money

Eric Idle, 71, was described by Mail critic Quentin Letts as the 'busiest and most enthusiastic' of the Pythons

Cutting to the chase: This Twitter user referred to the comedians' admission they needed more money

'Once they were the sharpest thing in satire.  Last night, quite often, they looked and sounded like a dodgy tribute band.'

He described Cleese as 'all implausible teeth and pot belly', while Gilliam, who was 'wearing one of those irritating ponytails old groovers of a certain era like to sport, 'seemed barely gripped by proceedings.'

The Mirror said the show's appeal lay in the fact that there was nothing new.

'It's not something completely different but that's exactly why fans will love it,' said Mark Jeffries, whose only criticism was not seeing enough of the Pythons onstage compared with the dancers.

The Express understood that the comedians, who range in age from 74 (Cleese) to 71 (Idle and Palin), needed time to 'recover from their exertions'. 

How they were: From left, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, and Graham Chapman who died in 1989

Enthusiastic review: The Twitter verdict wasn't all bad - this fan said last night's show was 'amazing'

The way they were: The dead parrot sketch, originally aired in 1969, was brought back to life at the O2

'It's a tall order for a bunch of old men and I think we can cut them some slack,' writes Neil Norman, who said they have 'embedded themselves in the cultural memory'.

But the i lamented the lack of new material, calling the show 'a lazy production' that relied on television footage and 'the whooping adulation of an audience who know all the words'.

Reviewer John Walsh admitted that some of the old sketches were 'still very funny' but said it became a little tiresome.

And comedian Russell Kane conceded it was a show for existing fans, rather than new converts. Tweeting after the show he wrote: 'Witnessed legends in action.'

Someone enjoyed it: Actor Stephen Fry, who made a brief appearance, tweeted about last night's show

The Guardian was less enthusiastic, concluding that the show 'isn't bad'.  'This live show won't make any converts. But it sends the faithful away happy,' said Peter Bradshaw.

Most enthusiastic, perhaps not surprisingly, given his brief on-stage appearance last night, was actor Stephen Fry, who tweeted afterwards: 'Oh my days. Just seen @montypython @TheO2 - in fact I made a little surprise appearance. Felt like being on stage with the Beatles *sigh* !'

The Monty Pythons were back, courtesy of their vitamin quacks and John Cleese's ex-wife's divorce lawyer.

Once they were the sharpest thing in satire. Last night, quite often, they looked and sounded like a dodgy tribute band.

We're
 ok: The Lumberjack Song took its inspiration from a discussion Palin 
had with an assistant cameraman, in which the subject was, the 
cameraman’s former jobs. One of the jobs was revealed to be that of a 
lumberjack 

But
 the show finally reached something worthy of the hype and the high 
prices (some tickets on the black market were going for close to £200) 
when they gave us such old favourites as the Spam sketch, the dead 
parrot sketch and best of all 'I Want An Argument'.

Messrs Cleese, Gilliam, Idle, Jones and Palin were appearing without Graham Chapman, deceased. Hence the title for the show.

Age
 has not been kind to Cleese who is all implausible teeth and pot belly 
these days - he is too lame to do the silly walks these days.

Gilliam
 was wearing one of those irritating ponytails old groovers of a certain
 era like to sport. He seemed barely gripped by proceedings. 

Palin
 and Idle were the busiest, the most enthusiastic. Palin has the milky 
gaze of a retired geography teacher but he still looks perfect in a 
brown shop assistant's coat.

Python fans filled the vast O2 and some of them had turned up in costumes - hankies on heads, braces, Viking helmets, etc.

One
 the menu: Lobster Thermidor aux crevettes with a Mornay sauce, served 
in a Provençale manner with shallots and aubergines, garnished with 
truffle pate, brandy and a fried egg on top and Spam

Eric Idle bursts into song on the opening night of Monty Python Live (Mostly) at the O2

They
 shouted along to the best-known sketches and cheered as soon as they 
heard familiar cues. Yet some ardent Pythonites in front of me kept 
yawning. 

No
 opportunity was missed to milk this loyal public. Shops flogged Python 
merchandise, from £50 hoodies to £15 romper suits for babies.

Several punters could be heard complaining about the cost of the programme (20 quid to you guvnor for 48 pages).

Argument clinic: Michael Palin plays a man who pays to have an argument with a very contrary John Cleese

In
 the interval an oh-so-jokey 'Merch-o-meter' was flashed up on screen to
 mock the idea of the Pythons' greed. Ho ho! But laughing at yourself 
does not necessarily expunge the rapaciousness.

Stephen
 Fry made a brief appearance on stage to talk about getting a lightbulb 
getting stuck up his back passage. Better was a cameo by Stephen Hawking
 - was it really him? We saw him in a film clip driving his wheelchair 
into TV's Prof Brian Cox and pushing him in the River Cam.

The Chancellor, George Osborne, was also in the audience, perhaps collecting tips for his next raid on the super-rich.

The
 Python humour, at its best (and last night that mainly meant old film 
clips such as the 100 Yards Race for People With No Sense of Direction),
 is genius.

At
 its less good it has aged. Inuendo no longer buys many spuds. Gags 
about the mentally deficient, gays and people with stammers are not much
 cop - but I did quite enjoy the camp judges. 

What
 would the old Pythons have made of these sad old chaps? They might have
 taken the rise out of them. Maybe we should we more merciful and just 
thank them for the old memories.
