Twenty minutes remained and the match was effectively over when the home side assembled a string of short passes. 

Ironic ‘Ole’s!’ echoed around the raucous old ground, followed by a chant of ‘Barcelona — We’re Coming For You!’ West Ham may be fourth at Christmas and Europe may be distantly beckoning, but their fans retain a decent sense of reality.

Despite the propaganda from the usual channels, Upton Park is not yet a haven for purists.

Andy Carroll got through a mountain of work during his side's 2-0 victory at Upton Park. Click here for our brilliant Match Zone.

The ball is still pumped urgently from front to back, fresh air is routinely preferred to green grass, and Andy Carroll’s head is the target for the booming bulk of their attacking intentions.

But the side is big, muscular, well-drilled and efficient. And it is currently fourth. For the moment, at least, the fans will settle for such unusual eminence.

Last night’s celebrations were suitably clamorous. 

‘Bubbles’ rang out like an anthem of triumph, backs were slapped and the air was punched in exaltation. It was one more scalp of a spectacular winter. Fine goals from Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing maintained a run which has seen just one West Ham defeat in 11 games.

Sam Allardyce struck an untypically exultant note.

‘We’ve got to enjoy the moment for as long as it last,’ he said. ‘Hopefully, it will last for a good while yet.’ Then caution took over: ‘The end of January will tell us what we could possibly achieve. It’s about consistency of winning. You can’t afford to slip. But at the moment, we’re enjoying it’.

And properly so.

Leicester had played the prettier, more precise football, but their finishing was inadequate and their physical challenge fell far short of that required of sides which come up against such a massed physical presence. 

Their position grows more precarious each week and, short of spectacular investment in the transfer window, survival is looking increasingly like a distant dream.

In fairness, they had appeared comfortable in the opening stages, moving the ball easily and intelligently, making the half - chances, generally looking the more confident side, despite their perilous position. 

West Ham could offer Alex Song to counter in kind, with his own thoughtful, considered approach. Song, alongside the impressive Downing, gives them a dimension beyond the purely physical, and yesterday both men contributed richly.

It was Downing who choreographed Carroll’s first chance in the 22nd minute, when he cut back a cross from the goal – line. Carroll, perhaps startled by a ball approaching less than eight feet off the ground, lifted the offering high into the stand. 

But his chance of redemption was presented almost immediately. 

Leicester were attacking with some intent when the ball was hacked out of West Ham’s area. Paul Konchesky, once a West Ham player, attempted a ludicrous back pass from half way, wide out on the touchline. 

Ineptly hit, the ball coasted into the path of Carroll, who strode on unopposed and casually chipped the advancing Ben Hamer.

It was the kind of finish which breaks fragile hearts, and we could see Leicester’s shoulders sagging at such a self – imposed handicap.

Things did not improve for Nigel Pearson’s side. 

In 32 minutes, Andy King was booked for a reckless tackle, and two minutes later Riyad Mahrez discovered Leicester’s best chance, snapping a fierce drive at the top corner, and seeing it instinctively parried by Adrian in the West Ham goal. 

Before half time, Jamie Vardy was harshly booked for flinging a tackle at Song.

Without ever looking truly convincing, West Ham found themselves in command at the interval, while Leicester, for all the shrewd subtleties of Esteban Cambiasso, had supplied a good many reasons for their present predicament. 

But the tone was raised by a tremendous goal in 56 minutes. 

The prologue was familiar, with yet another ball pumped high to the edge of the Leicester area and Diafra Sako winning the header. It fell to Downing, 20 yards out, and he glanced up, arranged his feet and curved a measured drive beyond Hamer. 

It was, by some distance, the most elegantly effective manoeuvre of the match.

Leicester’s retaliation was meagre, largely limited to a self – made, self – wasted chance from the substitute David Nugent. 

But West Ham had deserved their security, just as they deserve their current status. There is a long, long way to go, and many a plot will unfold. With Chelsea and Arsenal next up, their credentials will be thoroughly tested.

But, for the moment, West Ham have sound cause for celebration. “Enjoy the moment’, Allardyce exhorted. 

The strains of Bubbles, bellowed over and over through the chill December evening, revealed that his instructions were being faithfully obeyed. In this part of East London, it prmises to be the happiest of Christmases.
