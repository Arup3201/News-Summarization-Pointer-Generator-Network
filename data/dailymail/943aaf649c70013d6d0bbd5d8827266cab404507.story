A man accused of killing his wife at their North Dallas home last month died on Sunday after jumping from a highway overpass in Allen, Texas police said.

Eric Merz, 42, had been charged with murder but was out on bail after completing a 30-day program at a substance abuse treatment facility.

Police received a call that a man had jumped from the Sam Rayburn Tollway overpass and fallen onto the highway.

Suicide: Eriz Merz,42, was accused of killing his wife. He jumped from an 80-foot overpass to his death

He was struck by a car, but police are not able to tell whether he was killed by the vehicle or the 80 foot fall.

Cops found an unattended vehicle in the same area which was determined to be a rental car.

Police said the preliminary investigation indicates his death was a suicide and they do not believe he was pushed.

Authorities say Eric Merz  killed his wife on March 6th at the family's home in McKinney, Texas.

Killed: Merz was struck by a car after the jump. It's not known if he was killed by the vehicle or the fall

According to McKinney police, on March 6th, one of the two Merz children came home from school to find the family's home locked.

When the child looked through a window, she saw their mother’s body lying on the ground.

The girl then ran to a neighbor, who called 911.

Mary Beth Merz, 44, was found by the couple's 11-year-old daughter. She had been shot five times.

A neighbour saw the mother’s body through a window when the little girl came home from school and the police were called.

Police found Eric Merz asleep on the floor wearing a leather holster that held a semiautomatic pistol, and a loaded AR-15 assault rifle was nearby.

Merz had minor injuries and was taken to a hospital and was later charged with his wife's murder.

An officer said she overheard Merz say in the ambulance that he had lost his job six months earlier.

He also reportedly told paramedics that he had taken hydrocodone and was depressed.

Merz was released from jail five days later.

After completing a 30-day substance 
abuse treatment program he asked to move back home but an emergency 
protective order had prevented him from returning to his neighbourhood 
so he went to stay in a hotel.

Neighbours said they didn’t feel safe with Merz living on their block.

He was also not allowed to have contact with his two children. They are now staying with relatives in Oklahoma.

Merz was also required to wear an ankle monitor to track his location.

Mary Ann Solano, who lives across the street from the Merz home told WFAA she wasn't worried about his return.

'I wouldn't have been concerned because I saw him how he was prior to that,' she said. 'It's like a completely different person.'

She described him as personable before the incident in March.

'I am just in shock, just can't believe it,' she said of hearing the news he was dead.

Another resident, who didn't want to give her name said Merz was at her home and spoke to her husband the same day he took his life.

She said he showed no signs that he was contemplating suicide.

She also said neighbors she knew did not want to see Merz dead but were looking forward to justice in the case of his wife's death.
