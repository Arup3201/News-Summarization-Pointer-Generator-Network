Lea-Ann Ellison, the Los Angeles fitness enthusiast who triggered outrage last September when she posted photos of herself on Facebook lifting heavy weights just two weeks before her due date, has once again hit back at her 'haters'.

The 35-year-old mother of three, who gave birth to her youngest son four months ago, is back in the gym and says she, and little Skyler, are doing 'great'.

'I started back at CrossFit three weeks after my son was born,' she tells MailOnline. 'I did not go very hard as my body was still healing but I was so happy to be back to my program.'

The trim blonde proudly reveals her post-baby body in a new series of photos with son Skyler, and there's not a hint of a mommy tummy to be seen.

'I know, for me, that keeping strong and fit during pregnancy, and eating a diet full of fresh organic food has been key to my success in gaining my figure back,' she remarks. 'And no sugar! Sugar will keep a mommy tummy on a lady forever!'

According to MuscleTech.com, CrossFit entails 'an aggressive yet well-rounded pursuit of general, overall fitness in the ten recognized domains, as opposed to the bodybuilding ideology of pursuing perfect muscle symmetry, size and cuts.'

Ms Ellison says that when she fell pregnant, she received the go-ahead to continue with her workout 'immediately' from her health providers.

'This is something I have been doing for many years and to discontinue would have been a disservice to my body and my unborn baby,' she explains.

In response to harsh critics commenting on a TMZ article yesterday, the fitness queen took to her Facebook fan page, writing: 'I hope to inspire other ladies to be healthy and fit while pregnant and after. If you don't like it, sit your ass on a couch and eat a donut.'

She continued by revealing that she now works out twice a week, without a trainer so she can spend more time with her kids, and that: 'What seems dangerous and impossible for some is a walk in the park for others'.

But some were less than complimentary of Ms Ellison's approach. 'While what she did may not have harmed HER unborn child, it was completely unnecessary, with unpredictable results,' wrote one commenter.

'Going to this extreme sends the wrong message to expecting mothers,' mused another.

Ms Ellinson claims that the negative comments have 'no effect' on her at all. 'For a self confident person like myself it's like dust in the wind,' she remarks, adding that she simply feels 'sad' for individuals who aren't educated on the matter.

And to her credit, she does seem to have more fans than critics. Many who responded to the TMZ story mentioned that that the new mother looked 'great' and was an 'inspiration.'

'I can't believe we're at the point of attacking people who strive for a healthier life for themselves as well as their children,' mused one.

Another argued that people had chosen the wrong target to bash, writing: 'Why aren't we focusing more on moms who do drugs and other detrimental things?'

Ms Ellison, who has declared she wants to be a 'Hot Mom', gave birth to Skyler last November in her home using a birthing pool, with no pain medication at all.

'I think what a woman's body is capable of is extraordinary and I choose to be present and in control for the whole process by not using drugs,' she explains, admitting that she has 'always loved the birth process' and, miraculously, doesn't find it difficult 'at all'.

The tough cookie says she that kept exercising right up until she gave birth. 'Five days before Skyler was born, I completed 40 pull ups without assistance!' she reveals, adding that she did have to decrease her weights and 'scale back' on some aspects of her workout.

The feisty mother regularly takes to her Facebook page to document her fearless regimen. 'No excuses! 400 meters of walking lunges is no joke. Then strap on a 13 pound baby. Holy mother,' she posted in January, almost two months from the day since giving birth.

Ms Ellison first made headlines back in September when she posted a series of bold photos in which she is appears to be straining to pick up a heavy weight bar and lifting dumbbells above her head, all whilst sporting a huge pregnancy bump.

While many supported her decision to maintain her strenuous fitness regime, others were horrified.

'She is very selfish for endangering a life for her own personal gains and achievements. This is not a proud picture to post,' one respondent posted, as others labeled the photos 'sickening' and 'worrying'.

Andrea Nitz, a personal trainer at CrossFit Brand X, in Ramona, California has published an article for the The Crossfit Journal, addressing the question of whether the regime is safe for expectant mothers.

'As many studies have shown, itâ€™s not bad for our babies. It is actually very good for the kid,' Ms Nitz writes.

She goes on to speak from personal experience, writing: 'I have seen for myself that babies born to CrossFitting moms have a number of similar traits that make for a smoother transition to life outside the womb.'

And she may be right, if Ms Ellison's photos of her healthy-looking, bouncing baby boy are anything to go by.

The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists however, warns against undertaking strenuous exercise during pregnancy, saying: 'It has been reported that pregnant women whose occupations require repetitive, strenuous, physical work (e.g. lifting) have a tendency to deliver earlier and have small-for-gestational-age infant.'

Most medical guidelines fall somewhere in between on their advice. The Mayo Clinic warns that although a woman's 'tolerance to strenuous exercise will decrease' as the pregnancy progresses, it's perfectly safe in most cases.

'Regular exercise can help you stay in 
shape, better cope with the physical changes of pregnancy and build 
stamina for the challenges ahead'

In fact, according to a study last year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly one in four women in the U.S. are obese when they become pregnant, and the ill effects of this can be far more potentially dangerous to an unborn child.

Complications for an obese expectant mother may include high blood pressure, gestational diabetes and potential extra difficulties during labor and birth.

'Regular exercise can help you stay in shape, better cope with the physical changes of pregnancy and build stamina for the challenges ahead,' the Mayo Clinic states.

For Ms Ellinson, it's been a rewarding journey and she's thrilled to have picked up many fans and new friends along the way.

'I receive fan mail every day from women saying thank you for leading the way. It has been very wonderful to see such a positive result of such an unexpected popularity,' she concludes.
