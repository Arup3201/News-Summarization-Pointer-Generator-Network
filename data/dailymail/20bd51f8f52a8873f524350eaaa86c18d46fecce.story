A motorist who crash-landed his Audi TT half way up a house and survived is to be charged with drink driving. 

Lewis Richardson of Pakefield, near Lowestoft, Suffolk, suffered horrific head injuries and was left fighting for his life after he rammed the red sports car into the side of the house in nearby Carlton Colville in March this year.

Firefighters had to cut the 22-year-old free from the mangled wreckage which was left hanging off the ground for more than eight hours while emergency services, vehicle recovery teams and structural engineers worked frantically to make the scene safe.

A BMW and an Audi parked on the driveway as well as a van inside the garage were also damaged.

Three people were asleep inside the house at the time but were miraculously unharmed despite the severity of the crash.

Richardson was taken to James Paget University Hospital in Gorleston, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, where he was admitted in a critical condition.

The University of East Anglia graduate was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital, in Cambridge, where he stayed for several weeks before being allowed home.

Richardson will appear before Lowestoft Magistrates' Court in October where he is expected to be charged with drink-driving and careless driving.

A Suffolk Police spokeswoman said: 'A 22-year-old man from Lowestoft has been summonsed to appear before Lowestoft Magistrates' Court on October 29 in relation to a collision in Carlton Colville on March 24.

'He is due to be charged with drink-driving and careless driving.'

Weeks after the smash, Richardson's parents, Graham and Ann, wrote to the local newspaper to thank the emergency services that helped save their son's life. 

The grateful couple said: 'We would like to thank all the members of the emergency services who attended.

'We would also like to thank the A&E department at the James Paget University Hospital and Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for saving our son's life.

'We are also grateful to everyone who prayed for him and who sent their good wishes to him and our family.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
