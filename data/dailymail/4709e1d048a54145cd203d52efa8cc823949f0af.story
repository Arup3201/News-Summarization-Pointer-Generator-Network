Stan Wawrinka beats Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 on opening day of Davis Cup final between Switzerland and France

Roger Federer will decide if he can put his ailing body through one last test this year to try to salvage his Davis Cup dream.

The world No 2 was hampered by stiffness in his back while being trounced by a highly charged Gael Monfils as France levelled their final against Switzerland.

Yet Federer remained upbeat as he contemplated whether he could play in today’s pivotal doubles rubber alongside Stan Wawrinka, very much his foe in London last week but now his key ally.

The Davis Cup is the one blank on Federer's formidable CV, but he was powerless to stop an inspired Monfils 

‘I started to feel better as the match wore on, I’ll make myself available if I can play proper tennis, which I was able to do at the end of the match,’ he said. ‘It just takes a while for it to leave your mind. It’s like a ghost.’

It could require him to play three matches in as many days if he is to win the one prize in tennis that has eluded him.

It really was a case of changing places from that fretful night a week ago at the 02 Arena, where Federer edged out his compatriot Wawrinka amid the controversies of the heckling from his wife Mirka, who was nowhere to be seen.

With his slightly awkward movement to the backhand side Federer looked like he was still paying a price for all the exertion in London, and that only added to the resolve that the unpredictable Monfils drew upon.

Playing to a gallery of 27,432 fans, Monfils was gloriously assertive from the start and continually pushed back a subdued Federer, who looked as though he would rather have been anywhere else.

Faced with such animalistic aggression and struggling to adapt to the indoor clay court, Federer was unrecognisable from the man who rolled over Andy Murray barely a week ago.

France No 1 Tsonga proved more inconsistent throughout the match against Wawrinka

Wawrinka, by contrast, had produced the best response possible to a week when he suffered bitter disappointment and had his fortitude questioned into the bargain.

Cry baby? Not on this evidence, as he beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 in two hours and 24 minutes.

Thousands of Swiss fans have swollen the head count to the highest in history for an official tennis match and Wawrinka seemed galvanised by the experience.

The one period when he slipped was in the second set and, while it may have been coincidence, he dropped three straight games after someone called out ‘Cry baby, cry!’ between his first and second serves in the third game.

Tsonga is looking to help France win their 10th Davis Cup title and first since 2001

The match was Wawrinka's first since his much-publicised spat with Roger Federer at ATP World Tour Finals
