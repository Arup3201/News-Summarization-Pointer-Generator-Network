A family has been branded 'morally repugnant' by a coroner investigating the death of a young mother who sipped 'cannabis fertiliser' from a Sprite bottle in their kitchen.

Sarah Moss, 23, of Mottram, Hyde, Greater Manchester, drank the highly-toxic fluid while staying at the home of her boyfriend Daniel Fairbrother, who had left it on the side in the kitchen.

Her face swelled to twice its normal size and she started vomiting a foul-smelling black substance, an inquest heard.

Inquest: Sarah Moss, 23, died after inadvertently drinking 'cannabis fertiliser' stored in a Sprite bottle at her boyfriend Daniel Fairbrother's house

Daniel Fairbrother and his mother Julie 
took Ms Moss to A&E at Tameside Hospital, where they told doctors the 
bottle contained fish tank neutraliser.

Even when it emerged that the damage to the young mother's throat was so severe her oesophagus was corroded to a 'piece of string', her weight plummeted to 5st and the bottle was found to contain an extremely high level of alkaline, the Fairbrothers stuck to their claim.

She died at Tameside Hospital in June 2011 after six months of agony.

Before her death, Ms Moss told her mother Lynn Moss that her boyfriend later confessed the bottle contained cannabis fertiliser.

The inquest also heard from detectives who found a cannabis farm at the Fairbrothers' Stalybridge home, for which Daniel's brother James was jailed.

But throughout the hearing, the Fairbrothers maintained the liquid was fish tank neutraliser which they had found at a house clearance.

'Morally repugnant': The evidence from James Fairbrother (left), his brother Daniel Fairbrother (centre), and their mother Julie (right), was 'at best inconsistent' the coroner said

'Much loved': Ms Moss died as a result of post-operative complications on injuries she sustained after ingestiion of a corrosive substance, the coroner said

Summing up at the hearing in Stockport, Tameside coroner Joanne Kearsley said: 'It beggars belief as to what an unbelievably stupid, naive and thoughtless act it was, not only placing such a liquid in a Sprite bottle but to then crassly leave the bottle where anyone could have taken a drink from it.

'The evidence from the witnesses Julie, Daniel and James [Fairbrother] was at best inconsistent, but in my view was a continued attempt to maintain a fabricated account - an account concocted on the day in order to protect themselves and to try and hide the real reason they'd had such liquid in their possession.

'Ignorance and arrogance': Before her death Sarah Moss told her mother that Daniel Fairbrother (pictured) had confessed the bottle contained cannabis fertiliser

'Despite not knowing the extent of the injuries suffered by Sarah, there was no one who attended at A&E that night prepared to give an honest account to the medical staff as to what was known about the liquid.'

She added: 'The ignorance and arrogance of those attending with Sarah that night, even when medical staff were doing their best to contact the National Poisons Information Service and trying to find out as much information as possible, I find astounding and morally repugnant.'

She said the liquid was not acquired or left on the side with the intent of trying to harm anyone, but added: 'I have no doubt that the presence of cannabis in the property was a fact known to everyone who stayed there and that the liquid was not something they intended to use for the fish tank.'

Ms Moss's family welcomed the coroner's verdict and said the Fairbrothers failed to help her.

Her mother Lynn Moss said: 'We wish to thank the coroner for her thorough and perceptive investigation.

'The family wishes to echo the words of the coroner in relation to the moral repugnance of individuals who could and should have helped Sarah.'

She added: 'Sarah never understood why she didn't receive an apology from Daniel for leaving the Sprite bottle out before she died.

'Sarah was a much loved and is a much-missed mummy, daughter, sister, sister-in-law, auntie, niece and friend. She will continue to be in our everyday thoughts and loving memories.'

Recording a narrative verdict, the coroner said Ms Moss died as a result of post-operative complications on injuries she sustained after ingestion of a corrosive substance.

A Tameside Hospital spokesman said: 'Sarah Moss was admitted to Tameside Hospital following ingestion of a highly-corrosive liquid which had a severely destructive effect upon her major internal organs. This injury can be associated with a poor outlook irrespective of management.

'After a difficult period of recuperation, a finely balanced clinical decision was made in conjunction with Sarah and her family to undertake surgery to increase the quality of her life.

'The coroner indicated that the efforts the hospital made were with the best of intentions, but sadly Sarah suffered post-operative complications leading to her untimely death.'

The family's solicitor, Zak Golombeck from Manchester law firm, Pannone said: 'It is regrettable that the evidence that has been heard demonstrates that Sarah's death could have been avoided with proper treatment.'
