A stray cat has become a local celebrity after it sneaked into a shop at an airport in far eastern Russia and helped itself to expensive fish and squid.

Despite being caught red-handed by staff at Vladivostok International Airport, the tabby cat continued its feast and didn’t seem to care that she was being recorded on a cellphone camera.

The furry intruder was eventually removed from the closed shop’s showcase fridge and given a proper home thanks to her newfound fame.

While it was an amusing sight, as much as £700 worth of seafood (approximately $1,100) was eaten or thrown in the bin as a result of the hungry cat’s feast at a shop called Fish Island.

The ravenous feline ate through vacuum-sealed packages of smoked fish and squid, according to staff.

A shop assistant told Russia’s Ria Novosti agency: ‘The cat made its way inside the counter, and ate and nibbled the goods, scratched and wrecked the packaging around the squid and dried fish.’

The airport said CCTV showed the cat sneaking into the shop while it was open, but staff didn't know she was there and locked her inside when they went home for the day.

It turned out to be a costly loss for the shop, which had to throw all of the fridge’s contents in the bin and sanitise the appliance before restocking it with more seafood.

The cat has become a local celebrity as many residents of Vladivostok offered to adopt her.

The cat was given to an ice hockey club and named Matroskin after an adventurous cartoon character

She has been gifted to Admiral Vladivostok, a professional ice hockey club in the Kontinental Hockey League.

The cat has become the team's official mascot.

They named her Matroskin after an adventurous feline character from the famous Soviet cartoon Three from Prostokvashino.
