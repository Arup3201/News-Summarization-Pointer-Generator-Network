Missionary has given way to the cowgirl, meaning British men are now very kindly allowing their partners to do more of the graft

Tradition has it that the British man is no good in bed. Lazy, timid and unadventurous, his most daring sexual exploits are leaving the lights on and the occasional removal of his socks.

However, a new survey commissioned exclusively for Esquire magazine’s 'Not Safe For Work' Issue reveals that the British man of today is a decidedly different creature: creative, confident – perhaps even cocky – and always up for a challenge. 

Esquire asked 500 men across the UK about their thoughts, habits and desires when it came to sex and the results are surprisingly reassuring.

More than half of British men (56 per cent) think they’re good – or very good – in bed, with Londoners the most likely to say so (65 per cent). Those who dwell in the capital also masturbated most often.

As far as sexual positions go, missionary has been overtaken on popularity by the cowgirl (31 per cent), meaning British men are now very kindly allowing their partners to do more of the graft.

One in four British men have even tried bondage for the first time in the last 12 months, reports Esquire, suggesting it’s not only female Kindle owners who are surreptitiously flicking through 50 Shades of Grey.

The British man is now also thinking outside the bedroom, with a bold 54 per cent of men having had sex in a public space, while almost of quarter of British men (23 per cent) admitted to Esquire that they’d received oral sex while driving, bringing a whole new meaning to the term hard shoulder.

British men have shaken off their former badge of being lazy and unadventurous in bed

And before you consider crashing on a friend’s sofa after a heavy night, bear in mind that 38 per cent of men admitted that the last place they’d had sex other than their bed was on the living room sofa.

British men are also very happy to self-service – more than one in five British men (21 per cent) masturbate at least once a day, while half of British men (50 per cent) watch porn at least once a week, the Esquire survey reveals. One in four British men watch it every day.

Esquire Editor in Chief Alex Bilmes says, 'It’s great to see British men are no longer sad sacks in the sack, but are full of confidence, enthusiasm and a sense of sexual adventure. Presumably it’s all the invaluable advice they’ve been receiving from the pages of Esquire, available every month from all self-respecting newsagents.'
