A boy has been found guilty of raping a teenager  in punishment for 'spreading rumours' about his sister, who told the victim 'snitches get stitches'.

Lacquan Weekes, 17, carried out the attack in an alleyway after being egged on by his sister Aliyah Weekes, 19, and a 16-year-old girl.

He was found guilty of rape, while his sister and the 16-year-old, who stood trial alongside him at the Old Bailey, were found guilty of aiding and abetting the attack.

The 15-year-old victim, who cannot be identified, was made to perform a sex act on Lacquan Weekes, who is 10 days away from his 18th birthday.

She had left home on an evening in April to buy a drink and was confronted by the two teenage girls in a park in Willesden, north-west London.

Aliyah Weekes had told her 'snitches get stitches' when she accused the victim of telling secrets about her and the 16-year-old.

Prosecutor James Dawes had previously told the court: 'It was Aliyah's idea. She was the one who said, 'Snitches get stitches'.

'She was the one who physically threatened (the victim) and said it was her who would punch her if she did not comply.'

Nine days earlier, Aliyah Weekes, the 16-year-old girl charged alongside her and the victim had been involved in an attack on a different girl in a park. The 15-year-old who was later raped had told police what had happened in that incident.

There were tears and wailing from the defendants in the dock as the jury came back after eight hours of deliberations to find the brother and sister and their friend guilty.

After the jury returned its verdicts, Judge Jeremy Donne, sitting at the Old Bailey, said: 'It seems to me there was degradation and humiliation which went beyond the commission of the acts.'

He described it as a 'sustained incident' involving prolonged violence. He said: 'There is no doubt that the defendants acted together to commit the offence.'Â 

The confrontation is said to have happen on a patch of grass outside the College of North West London campus in Willesden, north-west London (pictured) before the girl was led to an alley

The 19-year-old and the 16-year-old then forced her into an alleyway where she was forced to perform a sex act on the boy while they stood nearby, the court heard.

Afterwards, he grabbed her and tried to pull her back, but she managed to get away saying she wanted to go home, the court heard.

The victim's mother had become concerned when she did not come home by 10.30pm and had called police. All the defendants had denied the charges.

Aliyah and Lacquan Weekes were remanded in custody and the other defendant was bailed until their sentencing on on Friday, 17 October.

Investigating officer Detective Constable, Daniel Pegg, said outside court: 'This was a disgraceful attack during which the victim was surrounded, accused of betraying confidence, assaulted and then threatened with further violence if she did not comply with their demands.

'I would like to pay tribute to the victim for her bravery in giving evidence. I hope the sentences handed out will reflect the serious nature of this incident and dissuade others from committing such offences.'
