New manager Alan Pardew watched on as Crystal Palace laboured to a 0-0 draw away at Aston Villa on New Year's Day, and Sportsmail takes a look at his in-tray at Selhurst Park.

Sign two key players

A new striker could be the difference between them staying up or going down. Likewise, left back has been a problem position all season.

Crystal Palace need to sign a new left back to offer competition to Joel Ward (left, playing against Aston Villa)

Pardew needs to start getting the best out of winger Wilfried Zaha (left, chasing Carlos Sanchez)

Improve Zaha

We all know what on loan winger Wilfried Zaha is capable of; if Pardew (right) can get him to produce consistently Zaha will be a real weapon.

Absent stars

He must work out how to cope with losing Australia international Mile Jedinak, who is leaving for the Asia Cup, and Yannick Bolasie, who is off to the Africa Cup of Nations with Congo.

Improve home form

Only two league wins at home so far. Must turn Selhurst Park into fortress to survive in the top flight.

Learn how to win

Eight games without a victory is relegation form. Pure and simple.
