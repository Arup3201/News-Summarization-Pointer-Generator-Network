The artists impression that is hoping to solve the mystery of a 17 year old charred body found at the bottom of a ravine

Police have used the latest forensic techniques to recreate the face of a mystery man whose body was burnt and dumped in a ravine in Ecclesborne Glen near Hastings 17 years ago.

Detectives have been able to discover who the victim was, and have now issued an artist's impression in the hope someone might recognise him.

Authorities now believe that he was aged between 21 and 25 years when his badly burned corspe was discovered back on January 19, 1997.

An extensive investigation at the time was unable to identify the young man who was found in the ravine in east Sussex.

The UK Missing Persons Bureau and Sussex Police are now hoping the image could help them finally close the case.

A police spokesperson said previous records state there were no suspicious circumstances in the man's death, and an inquest had labelled it a suicide.

Detective Inspector Jon Gross said: 
'Even after all these years it would be good to identify him and give 
any relatives some peace of mind and closure.

'We will certainly consider publicising other unidentified bodies in this way but on the basis of a case by case assessment.'

The dead man was described as white, 5ft 10ins tall and of stocky build.

He was wearing blue jeans, a black jumper, an Adidas hat and black Doc Marten shoes.

He also had in his possession a watch made by Hana Time in Hong Kong.
