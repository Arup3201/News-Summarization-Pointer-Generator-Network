Oscar Pistorius has been pictured looking 'relaxed' while kayaking with friends - just days before he is due back in court charged with murdering his girlfriend.

The sprinter - known as the 'Blade Runner' - was spotted paddling with three male friends off the coast of Hermanus, South Africa, on Sunday.

It comes as South African police announced they have finished their investigation into the case.

Pistorius, 26, who is accused of gunning down model Reeva Steenkamp, is due to attend a hearing in Pretoria on Monday,  the day Reeva Steenkamp would have turned 30, 
where he is likely to be formally charged with her murder and a trial 
date could be set.

It comes after prosecutors concluded their 
investigation into the death of his girlfriend.

The Paralympian will return to court 
in Pretoria on Monday,

The 26-year-old double amputee and six-time Paralympic sprint 
champion has been charged with the premeditated murder of Ms Steenkamp 
on Valentine's night, but claims he shot the 29-year-old after mistaking
her for an intruder.

The Olympian was spotted kayaking by Bronwin du Plessis, 25, who was walking with his wife around the Old Harbour.

He said: 'He was standing next to a kayak with three of his friends and I saw the prosthetic legs. I looked up and I thought 'oh, it's Pistorius'.

'I had my camera with me so I quickly took a few photographs. It was totally by chance.

'Then they started carrying out the kayak and he was up in front with a friend at the back and then there was another two friends in another kayak.

'He looked relaxed, he wasn't looking over his shoulder - he was just like a normal person.

'You wouldn't think it was the same person you saw in the courtroom.'

Mr du Plessis said there were about a dozen other people around at the time but that none 'paid much attention' to Pistorius.

He said this could have been because of his longer hair style - even though he kept his prosthetic legs on the whole time.

'He looked like a totally different person,' added Mr du Plessis, who described the moment as 'surreal'.

Pistorius has been living with his uncle since being bailed by Pretoria Magistrates Court.

According to Beeld, Pistorius' uncle Arnold Pistorius said the athlete was in Hermanus visiting a family friend's mother - who is terminally ill.

The 'Blade Runner' has resumed a 'low-key track routine', according to his family.

In a statement on his website in June, they said: 'Oscar is not contemplating a formal return to athletics and his training is not aimed at preparing for competition.

'His focus at this time remains entirely on the court case. His family, and those close to him, have encouraged him to spend a few hours a week on the track to assist him in finding the necessary mental and emotional equilibrium to process his trauma and prepare for the trial.'

The athlete was 'overcome with emotion' when he pulled on his carbon fibre running blades for his first track training since Ms Steenkamp's death, his agent Peet van Zyl said, adding that Pistorius described his return to the track as 'bittersweet'.

Ms Steenkamp's parents previously said they are still searching for answers.

In a television interview in June, June Steenkamp said: 'There is only one person who knows what happened' on the night her daughter was killed.'
