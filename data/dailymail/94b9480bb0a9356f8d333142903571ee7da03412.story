A startling image is circulating online that appears to show a baby abandoned outside a betting shop.

The photo, posted on Twitter by a user from Lewisham, south east London, depicts a pram with a child's arm clearly visible outside a branch of Jenningsbet.

The image sparked fears that the child's mother or father had gone inside to place a bet - while one resident claimed they had seen an abandoned pram outside the same shop before.

Shock: The image, posted to Twitter on Tuesday, appears to show a pram left at the door with a child inside

The image was taken in Lee High Road and posted on Tuesday lunchtime by Twitter user @AshDuncs, who wrote: 'Only in Lewisham would you see this.'

It shocked fellow Twitter users and led one to claim she had seen the same thing a few years earlier.

Twitter user @kayleighwallsy, who lives in nearby Abbey Wood, said: 'I saw a buggy parked up outside here before with a screaming newborn in... Absolutely disgusting if you ask me.'

Police and social services said they had received no reports of potential child neglect.

Neighbouring shop owners also said they had not heard of the incident though one, who asked not to be named, claimed: 'I wouldn't put it past some of the people who live here'.

Jenningsbet managing director Greg Knight said: ‘I don’t consider it to be an issue that’s anything to do with us.

Is this an abandoned baby? The photo raised eyebrows, but police and social services were not alerted

‘If I 
thought there was an issue we could get involved with I would call 
social services, but it just looks like a parenting issue to me, and 
something that sadly you see all too often.

'‘We don’t know if it was one of our customers. It could have been anywhere along that parade. There’s a front door there too so it could’ve been a flat upstairs.’

The photo comes weeks after a mother was arrested on suspicion of neglecting her two-and-a-half year old daughter, who was found abandoned in a pram in Carlisle, Cumbria.

The 41-year-old was questioned as her daughter was placed temporarily in the care of social services.

Police were called on the night of March 28 by the occupants of a house, who said a woman had rung their doorbell and then disappeared.

They contacted police who found the pram with the girl inside when they arrived.

In November 2012, meanwhile, a girl was left outside the door of a betting shop in Bognor Regis, West Sussex - still tethered to the other side of the door.

Her mother appeared to leave the girl outside a branch of Ladbrokes for two to three minutes, where she struggled to free herself before the woman came out.
