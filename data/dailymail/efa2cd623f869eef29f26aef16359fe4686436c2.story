Arsenal, Crystal Palace and Newcastle are monitoring developments with Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis.

The 29-year-old only joined Swansea in the summer but is growing frustrated with his lack of first-team starts as he alternates with Wilfried Bony.

Gomis joined on a free transfer after his contract ran out with Lyon and is understood to have a release clause of £7million.

Gomis, who scored against Arsenal in Swansea's 2-1 win earlier this month, is also interesting the Gunners

Arsenal manager Wenger is still keen to add another goalscorer to his squad.

Gomis scored the winner against Arsenal, his first Premier League goal, barely a minute after coming on as a substitute against them earlier this month.

Gomis wants regular first-team football but is reluctant to take a perceived step down. He has reservations about joining Palace hence manager Neil Warnock is lining up a fresh bid for Sunderland's Connor Wickham. A move to either Newcastle or Arsenal has obvious appeal for Gomis however.

Swansea are in the market for another striker. They have tied Bony down to an improved contract but the Ivory Coast international is due to join up with his country for the Africa Cup of Nations from January 17 to February 8.
