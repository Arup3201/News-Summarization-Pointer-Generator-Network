Cricketer Phil Tufnell has recently been raving about a hair transplant after having the treatment to revive his thinning locks.

But one man bitterly regrets the day he decided to fork out on the cosmetic surgery.

Mal, 50, a self-employed glazier from Birmingham, was one of the unlucky 10 per cent for whom a hair transplant simply doesn't take - and he was instead left with a unsightly scar that stretched across the back of his head.

He said: 'I had the transplant and three years later I didn't look any different 
to before. I regret having it done in the first place, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.Â 

Bald truth: Mal paid for a hair transplant after losing his locks but it was successful

'I ended up worse than when I started. I had spent the money, and I 
have been disfigured, and the top of my head is still the same.'

Mal said the scar made him feel so self-conscious he would only go out in public wearing a cap - which he learnt wasn't practical on windy days.

'Once it blew off and I had to chase it down the street,' he said.

He added: 'Some people will point the scar out, other people will be quiet but I'll 
know they've noticed it. They say "what's that at the back of your head?"

He was left with scarring on the back of his head that made him feel self-conscious, left, but a new treatment has made it less visible. right

'When I tell them it was a hair transplant they say, "well that's a waste of 
money".'

In an attempt to hide the scar, Mal took an extreme measure.

'If I have to go out without my cap on, I get a pencil and shade 
the scar in. Then from a distance it doesn't look too bad,' he said.

The glazier had visited other hair specialists who recommended he wore wig but Mal didn't feel comfortable with that and hated the idea of having a comb-over.

New look: Mal has had his head tattooed so he looks like he has shaven hair. He said it was painful but worth it

Then he appeared on TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters who recommended another course of action - tattoos.

The treatment involves individual pigmentation to give the illusion of a shaved head.

As it is a tattoo, there is no fear of hair loss again and in Mal's case, it conceals his scar.

While the treatment was painful, Mal showed off the results on the show and said he was delighted with his new look.

He said: 'The scar blends in, you really have to look for it now so no one notices it. The treatment was painful at time but definitely worth it. I've thrown that pencil away, no more shading in the mirror!

Extreme Beauty Disasters is on TLC Thursdays at 8pm
