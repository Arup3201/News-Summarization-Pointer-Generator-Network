Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps was facing growing calls to resign this morning after being forced to admit he did work as a get-rich-quick salesman under a false name after entering Parliament.

Mr Shapps said he had 'screwed up' by insisting 'over firmly' that he had never had a second job after becoming an MP.

It comes after a recording emerged from 2006, a year after he was elected to Parliament, capturing the MP selling self-help guide Stinking Rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a 'ton of cash'.

Despite the revelation, David Cameron this morning insisted he had  full confidence in the Conservative party chairman.

Mr Shapps used to run the HowToCorp website featuring get-rich-quick advice from 'successful businessmen' Sebastian Fox and Michael Green - a name the Tory used as a business alias.

According to The Guardian, in the recording, Mr Shapps - under the Green pseudonym - told a fellow entrepreneur that the guide 'is not a cheap product', but 'a great internet marketing product'.

Asked about second jobs on LBC last month, Mr Shapps said: 'To be absolutely clear I don't have a second job and I have never had a second job whilst being an MP. End of story.'

But now the Conservatives say that although the chairman had talked of his writing career having ended when he became an MP 'in fact it ended shortly afterwards'.

Mr Shapps insisted it was an 'old story' and his business dealings had all been properly declared. 

But Labour said the Prime Minister needed to launch an investigation to 'establish all the facts'.

John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw in Nottinghamshire, said Mr Shapps should quit his role as party chairman.

Mr Mann said: 'He's a major embarrassment to David Cameron and the Conservative Party, and he needs to resign. 

'It means he has no ­credibility whatsoever and raises serious questions.'

Labour's Karl Turner, the shadow solicitor general, added: 'It beggars belief that the chairman of the Conservative Party went on live radio just three weeks ago and stated three times that he was not doing business as Michael Green while he was an MP, when new reports and audio tonight show quite clearly that he did.

'It seems that Mr Shapps's repeated denials, which were not in the heat of the moment but also included a calculated decision to instruct solicitors, were contrary to the facts. He also appears to have threatened legal action on the basis of this.

'David Cameron must now order an immediate inquiry into Mr Shapps's conduct and establish all the facts in the interest of the public.'

Mr Shapps tweeted: 'Old story: all properly declared at the time and all many years ago. Labour just hate business.'

A Conservative party spokesman said: 'Like many authors and journalists, Grant wrote with a pen name. 

'This was completely transparent: his full name and biographical details were permanently published on the company's main website.

'Given that this was a decade ago, and was mentioned during the cut and thrust of an interview, he referenced that his writing career had ended when he became an MP: in fact it ended shortly afterwards.'
