Mourners wore flowers in their hair and donned bright, colourful clothing as they paid tribute today at the funeral of a British backpacker who was murdered on a beach in Thailand.

A white horse-drawn hearse with a mounted police escort took 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge on her  final journey from her family home in Hemsby, Norfolk, to what her family had touchingly called 'Hannah's party'.

Hundreds of mourners lined the street as the cortege made its way along the 15-minute route to a packed-out St Mary The Virgin church, where dozens spilled over into the churchyard to listen to the service on speakers.

Tribute: The funeral of murdered British backpacker Hannah Witheridge, 23, was held in her home village in Norfolk this morning

Her father Tony and mother Sue clutched hands with her sister Laura and her partner as they made their way to the service, which they had touchingly called 'Hannah's party'

Bright: Scores of people, many in tears, arrived for the service in bright, colourful clothing, as requested by Miss Witheridge's family

Tragic: The 23-year-old backpacker was found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15 alongside murdered Briton David Miller

As the sun beat down onto her hearse on an unseasonably warm day, Miss Witheridge's family, including her mother Sue, followed Miss Witheridge's flower-laden coffin to the village church.

The funeral took place as Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha defended a police investigation into the murders of Miss Witheridge and David Miller, amid concern that two arrested Myanmar men may have admitted the crimes under duress.

Miss Witheridge's family had wanted to make the funeral a celebration of the young woman's life.

The family said they wanted to create the atmosphere of a wedding as they bid a final farewell to their loved one.

Her parents had asked for white ponies - who wore plumes of purple feathers - to lead the cortege, as a nod to their daughter's love of horses.

They also asked mourners to arrive at the service in brightly-coloured outfits, reflecting their daughter's vibrancy.

And they duly obliged, with hundreds of people - many of whom were visibly distressed - arriving at the church wearing floral wreaths and multi-coloured outfits.

So many people came to pay their respects to Miss Witheridge, a student at the University of Essex, that around 50 listened to the service on speakers in the churchyard.

The family had allowed media to observe the funeral guests as they arrived from a street opposite the church.  

Hannah's father Tony, her sisters Tania and Laura, and her brother Paul were among those who gave readings during the service, which was led by the Rev Charles Powles. A video of Miss Witheridge was also played. 

Bill Downs, a friend of Miss Witheridge, performed songs during the service, which echoed outside of the church and into the surrounding village.

Songs by John Legend, Cyndi Lauper, One Direction and Ed Sheeran were heard by the 200 mourners who filled the church.  

The service ended with Miss Witheridge's coffin, which was adorned with pink and purple flowers, being carried out by pallbearers - which included her father - for a private burial.

The song She's So Lovely by Scouting For Girls played in the background, when provoked a stirring round of applause from family and friends. 

Miss Witheridge's family had asked that friends and non-invited guests attending the funeral make donations to local charity Faith Animal Rescue instead of floral tributes.  

After the service childhood friend Dulcima Cushing, 29, said: 'It was a lovely service. It was happy but very, very sad. She was a lovely girl, really sweet. I don't know where the family managed to find the strength to get through the service.'

Rev Powles added that it had been an 'unusual service' which reflected Hannah's life.

He said: 'It was rather an unusual service but I felt it went very well. 'The family planned the whole thing with my help and I think it reflected Hannah's life.

'The family is as well as can be expected.'

Before her funeral, Miss Witheridge's family described her as a 'fun, vibrant and beautiful young woman', which was reflected by the colourful outfits at 'Hannah's party'

Before her funeral, the family had paid tribute to a 'fun, vibrant and beautiful young woman' who will be 'sorely missed by all who knew her'.

They added: 'She was dedicated, ambitious and would have made an amazing difference to the lives of many families through her chosen career as a speech and language therapist.'   

The 23-year-old's body was found on September 15 alongside fellow murdered Briton David Miller, 24, from Jersey, whose funeral took place last week. Miss Witheridge died from severe head wounds. 

Local police say two Burmese workers have confessed to the killings. Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, were arrested last Friday for the murders of the British tourists whose disfigured bodies were dumped on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao.  

The men, whose names were given only as Saw and Win, were paraded by police at a news conference last week as well as re-enacting the brutal assault. 

But they have reportedly retracted their confessions, amid allegations of torture used against them.

Deputy police chief spokesman Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said the two suspects had been charged with three offences - conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery - despite the fact that the two had yet to appear in court to face any charge and speak for themselves. 

Today, the Prime Minister, returning from a two-day visit to Myanmar, told reporters he would like to 'stop speculation' over the murders and 'let investigators do their work'.

He said: 'I would like the media to stop speculation and let investigators do their work. We must build foreign confidence and make Britain and other foreign nations understand. They might be a little surprised why the criminals were caught so quickly. I myself was excited.

'I want all Thais to stop and think that authorities have procedures in place. Nobody would dare catch the wrong person because this is a case of big international interest.' 

Prayuth added: 'They are not the culprits yet. We will handle this case with special attention, very fairly, so that we can win the trust of Myanmar people and the international community.'

The inquiry has been dogged from the outset by contradictory statements by officials. Police were widely accused of bungling the investigation, including chasing the wrong leads and failing to seal off the crime scene quickly enough. They have strongly denied allegations of abuse during the investigation.  

Miss Witheridge died from severe head wounds. Yesterday, her family said: 'As a family we hope that the right people are found and brought to justice'

In a statement released yesterday ahead of her funeral, the family hinted at their concern over the case.

They said: 'Time makes the pain of this horrendous tragedy no easier to bear.

'The past three weeks have been unimaginably difficult and there are no words that can adequately describe the heartache and despair that our family is experiencing.

'As we continue with our plans for our beautiful Hannah's 'party', our thoughts are with David Miller's family who are suffering the same indescribable agony.

'Due to the nature of her passing, our beautiful girl has had little privacy. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to ask that Hannah be allowed a well-deserved day of privacy on Friday whilst we join her many friends in a celebration of her life. 

'As a family we hope that the right people are found and brought to justice.'
