Martin Litton, pictured in 2012, was a  fierce wilderness advocate involved in some of the 20th century's biggest conservation battles. He died on Sunday aged 97 at his home in California

Fierce environmentalist Martin Litton, a bold whitewater navigator and even bolder advocate for preserving the wildlands of the American West, has died at age 97.

Litton had been in hospice care and died at his home in Portola Valley, California, on Sunday, said Alison Sheehey, programs director at Sequoia ForestKeeper, where Litton was president.

Litton was 'active in protecting the environment until just a few days ago,' Sheehey said.

Litton fought his way to the center of some of the biggest environmental battles of the last century, fiercely opposing the damming of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon — a fight he would win — and the building of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant on the California coast — a fight his side would bitterly lose. 

He was an unapologetic extremist for environmental causes, saying in one 2012 interview that if he could issue royal decrees, he'd take down the Golden Gate Bridge.

'I never felt it did any good to be reasonable about anything in conservation,' he was quoted as saying in a statement on his death from Sequoia ForestKeeper, 'because what you give away will never come back — ever.'

He also opposed the building of a ski resort in Mineral King Valley in California's Sierra Nevada and spearheaded the creation of Redwood National Park.

A California native who spent childhood summers camping in Yosemite National Park, Litton made his name and his legend as a guide on the Colorado River, pioneering and popularizing oar-powered recreation through the Grand Canyon and eventually earning a spot in the International Whitewater Hall of Fame. 

He first made the trip down the river in 1955, always preferring wooden boats to inflatable rafts, and kept making it into his 90s. He ran his last river trip in 2009 at the age of 92, during a fundraiser for Sequoia ForestKeeper.

He would go on to found several environmental organizations but also served on the board of the more mainstream Sierra Club from 1964 to 1972, when he was a loud voice for taking hard stances, making sure the club didn't acquiesce to a pair of federal proposals to erect dams in the Grand Canyon.

'If I hadn't done what I did, I think it's very likely at least one of those dams would have been put in the canyon,' Litton said in a 2011 interview with the Los Angeles Times, which first reported his death Monday.

'I was the only one screaming about them.'

Born in Los Angeles, California, on February 13, 1917, Martin was the son of veterinarian and the eldest of four children his parents raised during the Great Depression. His father, Clyde was originally from Tennessee and his mother, Elsie came from San Francisco.

Litton graduated from Inglewood High School in 1934 and entered UCLA where he graduated in 1938 with a degree in English. During college he enrolled in the mandatory two-year ROTC program and then continued onto the optional officer training program, becoming a reserve officer after graduation.

During World War II he joined the Army Air corps, but due to color blindness was disqualified from flying P-40 fighters, but convinced doctors that he could still become a glider pilot.

In 1942 he married Esther Clewette, but their honeymoon was cut short by his immediate deployment to the 82 Airborne’s 325th Glider Infantry Wing to fly sorties over Europe.

After the war he and Esther raised  their four children in Bel Air until 1961 when they moved to northern California.

In 1952, Litton took his first raft ride through rapids and joined the fight to protect Dinosaur National Monument from proposals to dam two nearby rivers.

His first trip down the Grand Canyon was in 1955, and he subsequently pioneered a huge victory against damming the Colorado, which would have backed up the Colorado River, flooding the Grand Canyon and making it a lake.

Continuing to make trips down the river he founded the Grand Canyon Dories in 1971. He owned that commercial rafting company until 1990. 

Serving as the Travel Editor for Sunset Magazine from 1954-1968, he wrote passionately about the grandeur of western landscapes. In 1960, the magazine ran a cover story by Litton entitled 'The Redwood Country', which is credited with launching a campaign that eventually led to the establishment of Redwood National Park along the northern California coast.

After many years of battling Sequoia National Forest’s non-stop logging program, a slight victory was achieved with the U.S. Forest Service signing the 1990 Sequoia Mediated Settlement Agreement to restore the logged sequoia groves to their natural condition and by the Presidential Proclamation in 1992. However logging continued.

In early 2000, President Clinton created the 327,000-acre Giant Sequoia National Monument protecting the sequoia groves in perpetuity, but four years after the creation of the monument, the Forest Service returned to business as usual with even more logging proposed.

In response, Martin and many more alarmed activists helped create the non-profit organization Sequoia ForestKeeper in 2001 to become the “eyes, ears, and voice of the forest” of the southern Sierra Nevada.

Litton is survived by his wife, Esther; children John, Donald, Kathleen and Helen; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.
