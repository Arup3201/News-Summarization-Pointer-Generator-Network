Moments after announcing his imminent change of codes, Kevin Sinfield was asked if he had ever played a game of rugby union before. ‘No,’ he said, emphatically.

There was a pause, as if the league icon was trying to fathom whether the question had been a joke, before he added: ‘They don’t play much rugby union in Oldham.’

That is undoubtedly true, but the current England fly-half, George Ford, also grew up in the Lancashire town, as did his Bath team-mate, Kyle Eastmond.

Now, at the age of 34, Sinfield is aiming to follow those younger converts across the rugby divide, having opted to leave Leeds Rhinos at the end of their season, to join sister club Yorkshire Carnegie.

The former England captain is a record-breaking legend in the 13-man game, but he wanted one last career challenge; a late shot at union.

‘It’s something that excites me and I’ve wanted to do for a long time, but I never thought that I would get the chance to do it,’ he said, shortly after informing his Rhinos team-mates of his impending move.

‘The club has set targets to get back to where it belongs in the Premiership and that is something I want to be part of.

‘I didn’t want to get to the end of my career and look back with regrets about missed opportunities. So when this opportunity came up, my gut was telling me it was the right thing.

‘I’m very respectful of the game (union) and I like watching it. A lot of rugby league people look down on union and a lot of rugby union people look down on league, but I like both games. As a sportsman, the opportunity to play another professional sport really appeals to me.’

Sinfield has no intention of making life easy for himself, when he tries to translate his enduring talents to union. Many of the converts who have fared best have been outside backs such as Jason Robinson, but his hope is to occupy the primary decision-making role.

‘I’d very much like to play fly-half – that’s the position that would suit my skills-set the best,’ he said. ‘I understand the challenge that is in front of me; the difficulties that rugby league players have faced coming over.’

Sir Ian McGeechan was present for the announcement in Leeds, in his role as Yorkshire Carnegie’s executive president, and the man synonymous with the Lions appeared visibly elated about the Championship club’s recruitment of such a pedigree figure, on an 18-month deal.

‘This is fantastic news,’ he said. ‘It is a great opportunity to get someone of Kevin’s quality, not just as a player but as a captain and someone who is an exceptional role model.

‘There was a change of ownership at Yorkshire Carnegie at Christmas and the ambition is for Premiership rugby. To have Kevin involved is a great acquisition for us and a statement of intent. We’ve got a lot of young men willing to learn from a natural leader. I for one am very excited.’
