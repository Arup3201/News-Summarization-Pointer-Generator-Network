When you’re at one of DJ Steve Aoki’s shows, you know it’s  time for cake.

One lucky festival goer was left covered in vanilla frosting after the headliner act hit the stage at the annual music festival Stereosonic at Melbourne Showgrounds on Saturday.

When the American DJ was playing his set, he picked up a birthday cake in one hand and pointed his other hand  at the screaming revellers as he picked his target.

Time for cake! America DJ Steve Aoki getting ready to hurl his famous cake-throwing stunt at his adoring fans

Some willing party goers were seen waving their hands in the air and pointing their fingers at themselves as they requested to be pegged in the face by the famous cake-thrower.

The video shows one young woman, who is wearing a blue top, sitting on top of another person’s shoulder as she throws both her arms in the air.

Within seconds, Aoki hurled the cake into the crowd and splattering all over the women's head but she continues cheering and pumping her arms to the beat of the music.

Donning pattern tights and a black top, Aoki’s trademark scraggly long black hair was tied back when he launched the cake into the cheering crowd.

‘The crowd knows what to expect, especially the front row. Whoever makes the biggest sign usually gets the cake.

‘I’ve hurt my shoulder throwing cakes this year. I’m not kidding. So I've had a physiotherapist work on my shoulder every show to like f****** get it prepared and ready, because I've thrown it out. It’s like I'm a pitcher now, as well as a DJ.’
