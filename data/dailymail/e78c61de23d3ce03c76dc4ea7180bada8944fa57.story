Punishment: Nurse Stephen Johnson faces being struck off for his treatment of mentally ill patients

A senior nurse who goose-stepped around a room of mentally ill patients while performing Nazi salutes faces being struck off.

Stephen Johnson put a finger under his nose to represent
a Hitler moustache and marched around the NHS care home in Essex like Basil Fawlty in the comedy classic Fawlty Towers.

He reduced a patient who suffered from delusions that he was Adolf Hitler to tears.

The patient – identified as Patient C – had a strange obsession with Nazi Germany and suffered from hallucinations.

Johnson cruelly 
encouraged him to live out his fantasy by performing the 
salutes made famous by the Nazi regime and shouting 'Heil Hitler', a 
Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) panel found.

The nurse’s behaviour came to light 
when bosses at the North Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust 
investigated a seven-month campaign of sexual harassment against a 
Polish colleague, known only as Miss A.

The 
former deputy ward manager, who had worked at Severalls House in Colchester for more than two decades, made the Nazi salutes in front of Miss A and a male Jewish colleague, known as Mr D.

Johnson, 54, flies a St George’s flag from his home in 
Essex.

He was
yesterday found guilty of eight allegations of misconduct in 2008 and 
2009.

He sent explicit messages to the Miss A, groped Mr D and made racist remarks, and repeatedly grabbed a male patient's genitals.

Karen Russell, who still works at the 
ward, told the hearing: ‘He would mimic the patient who had been
doing the Nazi salutes.

‘He would be marching up and down saluting and shouting.'

She said he would raise his arm to a Nazi salute with a finger below her nose.

She added: ‘It would wind [patient C] up and he  would cry. He [Johnson] would do the baiting.’

Miss Russell told the hearing that the patient had an obsession 
with Nazi Germany and would suffer hallucinations.

She added: ‘The patient would often speak in a German accent and go on about Nazi Germany. He’d say he was Adolf Hitler.’

Chris Renehan, the clinical manager at the time, told the panel Johnson would incite the patient to shout ‘Heil Hitler’.

Mr Renehan, who now works at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, added: ‘Mr Johnson was very black and white.

‘He either liked you or he didn’t – and that tended to be people that were ethnic minority or people not English.

‘He was very English. Very British.’

He also performed the role of a German soldier in front of Miss A, which she was said to find ‘particularly offensive as she is Polish, and associations with the Second World War have particularly offensive significance to her.’

Johnson, who lives in a quiet cul de sac in Great Horkesley, Colchester, called Mr D by the names of Arab terrorist organisations, Hezbollah and Hamas, and once said to him, ‘BNP go home’.

The male care assistant also reported Johnson to police for grabbing his genitals at work while another colleague 
pinned his arms behind his back.

Johnson denied the charges, accusing colleagues of conspiring against him and making him a scapegoat.

But James Spencer, chair of the NMC panel, said:  'The panel is not 
satisfied that any of the witnesses have colluded, that Mr Johnson has 
been made a scapegoat or accused of any of these things for any reason 
other than the facts included in the charges.'

The panel also found Johnson guilty of grabbing another patient's genitals on an almost daily basis.

Miss Russell said in a 
statement: 'Mr Johnson would stand facing him and hold the patient's 
genitals through his clothing.

'Mr Johnson would grab the patient's genitals all the time, I would say this happened on a nearly daily basis.

'He did it to make people laugh, the staff would laugh.'

Johnson's campaign of harassment began just three weeks 
after Miss A joined Severalls House, after the pair took a 
patient on a trip to London.

'Mr Johnson sent a pornographic photograph of a woman's vagina', said Mr Unwin.

'She found this disgusting, showed the
picture to her boyfriend, and then deleted it. She replied to Mr 
Johnson, telling him to grow up.'

But Johnson continued to bombard her with messages, saying, 'You sexy momma, I love you.'

He added: 'Don't you give up on me' and 'I want to complete you :) xxxxx', and repeatedly tried to call her at midnight.

'Mr Johnson himself performed a Nazi salute while in her presence and while looking at her,' added Mr Unwin.

'She found this particularly offensive
as she is Polish, and associations with the Second World War have 
particularly offensive significance to her.'

'Miss A felt threatened by his conduct
and felt that if she didn't tell Mr Johnson what he wanted to hear he 
would make her life at work very difficult.'

Unacceptable: Johnson's tasteless behaviour is reminiscent of a memorable scene in Fawlty Towers in which Basil Fawlty goose-steps around his hotel

The tribunal heard the sexual 
texts stopped when Johnson's wife, who also works at the trust, saw
a message and called Miss A to confront her.

After Miss A reported Johnson's advances, Mr D came forward to report the deputy ward manager 
for groping him while on duty.

Mr D described one incident in October
2008 when Johnson and another member of staff allegedly ambushed him 
while he was looking through a colleague's holiday photos.

He said he was standing outside Severalls House, when Johnson and the male member of staff 'jumped' on him.

'He (the other male) grabbed both my hands behind my back, Mr Johnson grabbed my genitals outside of my clothes,' he said.

The
panel was told that the staff nurse Mr D had been speaking to at the 
time was still present and took a photograph of the incident.

'It is not acceptable in my country or my culture,' said Mr D. 'I was very offended and felt violated.

'Mr Johnson had no respect for any staff members at Severalls House.'

Mr D told the panel the insults happened almost every shift at the care home.

Johnson
was arrested by police and questioned on suspicion of groping Mr D in 
January 2010, but was later released without charge.

Johnson resigned from the trust in August 2010 before a full disciplinary process could take place.

He admitted sending the texts to Miss A, but claimed it was part of a two-way consensual conversation.

Johnson
said the thought of being in the same building as Mr D 'makes me feel 
sick', and did not attend the central London hearing.

Johnson's fitness to practice was later found to be impaired by reason of misconduct at the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Panel chair James Spencer said: 'It is unlikely Mr Johnson would have treated a patient without a mental health disability in this manner and his conduct amounts to discrimination on the basis of disability.

'He abused his senior position and did not treat patients or staff with respect or dignity.

'The panel has determined that Mr Johnson's fitness to practice is impaired by reason of his misconduct.'

The panel will now consider what sanction to impose upon Johnson.
