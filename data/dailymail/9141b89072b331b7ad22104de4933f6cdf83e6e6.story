Cristiano Ronaldo has been handed a two-match ban for his outburst during Saturday’s 2-1 win over Cordoba.

Much to the dissatisfaction of Real Madrid’s title rivals the player will now miss only Real’s home game with David Moyes’ Real Sociedad on Saturday and the home match with Sevilla three days later. He will be available for one of the season’s title deciders away to Atletico Madrid the following weekend.

Pressure had been put on the Spanish FA to make an example of Ronaldo after he slapped Cordoba defender Jose Angel Crespo at a corner, then kicked Edimar, and landed another blow on Crespo.

But match referee Alejandro Hernandez never saw the first incident and only reported the kick on Edimar in his match report and not the subsequent striking of Crespo.

Hernandez’ match report stated: ‘In minute 83 the player Cristiano Ronaldo was sent off for the following reason: Kicking his rival off the ball’.

The Spanish FA’s disciplinary committee could have asked Hernandez to elaborate on his report but instead have given Ronaldo the minimum punishment for the digression outlined by the referee.

It was Ronaldo’s ninth career red card and he now has eight more than Leo Messi who has never been sent off for Barcelona but was red-carded on his debut for Argentina. 

The Portuguese international still has some way to catch Zinedine Zidane. The Real Madrid legend currently coaching the club’s B-team was sent off 14 times in his career.

Ronaldo apologised for the sending off on social media after for forgiveness for his moment of rashness, saying: 'I apologise to everyone and especially Edimar for my thoughtless act in the game today'. He is also understood to have said sorry to team-mates in Monday’s training session.

Ronaldo’s red mist comes at a difficult time for Real Madrid. They lost the opening league game of the year against Valencia, were knocked out of the cup by Atletico Madrid, have a potential Fifa transfer ban hanging over them, and an improving Barcelona close on their heels.

On Saturday they will have to cope without their talisman as Real Sociedad come to the Bernabeu having already beaten Madrid once this season.
