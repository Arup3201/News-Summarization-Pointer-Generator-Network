Who should be England's next captain?

It’s not easy retiring from England. You don’t just pick up the phone and tell the Football Association you have had enough then quietly move on.

Ending an England career is big news and I know exactly how Steven Gerrard felt on Monday when he announced that he had reached the end of the line with his country. I made the same move in 2007, even though I briefly returned for the World Cup in 2010.

Our respective circumstances could not be more different. My decision was born of frustration. I was not playing for Steve McClaren’s team as much as I felt I deserved; I had just played in two Champions League finals but couldn’t dislodge John Terry and Rio Ferdinand.

Steven, on the other hand, has almost
 always been a first choice and has pulled the curtain down at time when
 he was still a vital member of the team, never mind just being someone 
who was around the squad.

Steven
 has been mulling this over for a while, weighing up what he should do, 
but the closer it came to revealing his decision, the more difficult he 
found it.

When we spoke, my advice to him was that international 
retirement would benefit him as much mentally as physically. He is in 
great condition at the minute, so I am not sure the extra games would 
have been a problem; being England captain, though, comes with huge 
responsibility and pressure and those demands can be draining.

Now
 he will be able to get time to completely switch off and be refreshed 
for the Champions League games that will be on Liverpool’s agenda and 
recover from the little fitness niggles footballers tend to carry. 
Liverpool, certainly, will benefit from this decision.

England,
 by contrast, will miss him. But how will he be remembered? I described 
him as a great servant. Unfortunately for Steven and others, such as 
Frank Lampard, Terry, Ferdinand and David Beckham, there will always be 
that feeling of what might have been.

For players of that quality never 
to reach a major semi-final with England, let alone win an international
 trophy, will be considered a major disappointment and that is why 
Steven once rated his England career as ‘six out of 10, maybe seven’.

I
 think that is harsh. Winning 114 caps is a phenomenal achievement to 
look back on when he finally hangs up his boots. Considering the games 
he missed through injury when he was younger, he could have smashed 
Peter Shilton’s record of 125 appearances. 

There
 were highlights, too, such as goals at two World Cup finals,  scoring 
in the 5-1 win over Germany and the goal that took England to Brazil. He
 was unselfish, as he played in a variety of roles in midfield and got 
on with his job.

He did 
that because he loved playing for England.  I once said I never felt 
the same affinity for England as I did for Liverpool because I was on 
the outside looking in. With Stevie, nothing could have been more 
different.

The pride he felt leading the side, particularly under Roy Hodgson, was there for all to see.

Having
 suffered such disappointment when caretaker Stuart Pearce picked Scott 
Parker as skipper against Holland in February 2012, being made permanent
 captain brought him such joy. That’s why he didn’t make this 
announcement without giving it maximum thought.
