Politicians in California are demanding millions in funding to add more cells to the state's death row - because it has run out of room.

The wing at San Quentin prison has continued to fill up with condemned men because there have been no executions in nine years. 

There are 751 convicts awaiting their fate, but a moratorium was put on lethal injections in 2006 following complaints of inadequate anesthesia and cramped conditions inside the dated death chamber - which has since been updated. 

Overcrowding: Governor Jerry Brown is demanding $3.2million in funding because California's death row at San Quentin prison (pictured) has run out of room - even though there have been no executions in nine years 

Yet more than 160 people have been sentenced to die since.

The delay was lengthened in 2014 when a federal judge ruled that the capital appeals process in the state is so slow that it constituted cruel and unusual punishment - because executions were so unlikely and random.

But with plans to appeal the ruling, Governor Jerry Brown is asking the state legislature for $3.2million so he can add 100 cells, The LA Times reported. 

California Department of Corrections spokeswoman Terry Thornton told the Daily Mail Online: 'State law mandates that male condemned inmates be housed at San Quentin State Prison. 

'This project is to ensure that San Quentin will have enough beds to accommodate a growing condemned inmate population.'

The demand for more space comes despite the dramatic fall in the Californian prison population.

Low-level drug offenders and thieves are being released because of new legislation introduced last year - meaning more cells are being made available.  

Condemned men are held in San Quentin in California's bay area, which has a capacity of 715, while the 20 women awaiting execution are housed at the Central California Women's Facility near Chowchilla. 

Update: The state's new and  execution chamber in San Quentin was opened in 2010, but it is yet to host an execution following a string of legal decisions 

The men are housed separately to the general population, but would have been overflowing if a 25-cell psychiatric ward for death row inmates hadn't been added last summer.

A budget proposal seen by The Times predicts 20 new death row inmates arrive every year.

The funding would go towards the revamping of a block inside the main prison - beefing up security and updating the showers so inmates can be cuffed while they wash. 

The last person to be executed in California was frail 76-year-old Clarence Ray Allen in January 2006. 

He was legally blind, used a wheelchair and suffered from diabetes and chronic heart disease, had been sentenced to death for ordering the murders of three people in 1980 while serving a life sentence for murder in California's Folsom Prison.

Two guards assisted a frail Allen, wearing an Indian headband, from a wheelchair  into San Quentin's cramped death chamber and he was gently scooted onto the gurney where he would die.

In September 2010, a judge ruled that Albert Greenwood Brown's execution would go ahead. But his death has since been delayed because of the state's falling supply of sodium thiopental.
