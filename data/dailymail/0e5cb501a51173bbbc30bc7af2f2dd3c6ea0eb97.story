With Christmas fast approaching, children named Bradley and Paige will need to be on their best behaviour if they are to avoid Santa's naughty list, a survey claims.

It suggests that youngsters with these names are likely to be the least well-behaved.

But those called Benjamin and Elizabeth can hang up their stockings now, as they are most likely to be the best-behaved children.

On the naughty step: you are more likely to be found here if your name is Bradley or Paige (file picture)

The survey, by School Stickers, looked at the names of more than 63,000 children who logged good behaviour or achievement awards in online sticker books.

It found that the boys' names which appeared most frequently were Benjamin, Alex, Jordan, Mohammed and Aaron.

The girls who were most likely to receive the stickers were called Elizabeth, Rosie, Grace, Lydia and Emma.

The boys' names that appeared least often were Bradley, Jacob, William, Morgan and Joe.

And the girls' names which appeared least often were Paige, Niamh, Natalie, Holly and Phoebe.

School Stickers managing director Neil Hodges said: 'The annual "Santa's Naughty and Nice List" is just a little bit of Christmas fun.

'All children are individuals and just because a child is called Elizabeth or Benjamin does not mean they are going to be angels, just as Paiges and Bradleys are not necessarily little monsters.'
