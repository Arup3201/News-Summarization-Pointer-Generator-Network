YOU SAY POTATO by Ben Crystal and David Crystal (Macmillan, £12.99)

Ozzy Osborne is known for his heavy Birmingham accent

In 1997, a hundred students were asked to listen to what they believed were tapes of the police interviewing various suspects — in fact, everyone concerned was an actor. The people playing the suspects either spoke in Received Pronunciation — BBC English — or with Birmingham accents. The students were then asked to say if they thought the suspects were guilty or innocent.

It turned out they were twice as likely to convict someone who spoke with a Brummie accent. The reason was simple: the Brummies, they reckoned, ‘sounded guilty’.

Somehow, I suspect that this won’t come as that great a surprise to anyone who doesn’t actually hail from Birmingham. The flattened vowels, the aggrieved uplift at the end of each sentence . . . Surely anyone who talks like this must have something to hide?

But just a year after the experiment, a nightclub owner in Israel took out adverts in Birmingham papers for staff. Why? Because his clients couldn’t get enough of the accent. They thought it sounded cool and sexy.

What’s going on here? Why do accents sound different to different people? And, more to the point, why do we speak with accents at all? The reasons, Ben Crystal and his father David believe, go back a long way.

Trying to work out someone’s identity in the dark would have been a critical business for early humans. If you were sitting in a cave and you heard voices outside, you would want to know if they belonged to friends or foes. If they spoke the same way as you, it was probably safe to go out. If not, you’d best sit tight and keep your hands fastened around that club.

Accents, of course, say an awful lot about us. They proclaim where we’re from, what class we belong to, our ethnic origins, even our educational history. They’re also something we judge people on — and our judgments tend to be as swift as they are unforgiving. Yet it doesn’t explain why Birmingham should be synonymous with shifty.

In the Middle Ages there was no such thing as Received Pronunciation; everyone spoke with a regional accent. RP, as it’s known, was a reaction against Cockney.

But Brummies can console themselves with the fact that though they regularly come top of polls to find the most unattractive accent in the UK, when it comes to sounding bolshy, Belfast stands supreme.

Talking posh turns out to be a comparatively recent invention. In the Middle Ages there was no such thing as Received Pronunciation; everyone spoke with a regional accent. RP, as it’s known, was a reaction against Cockney. Essentially, it was everything Cockney wasn’t. If Cockneys dropped their h’s, polite society wouldn’t. If Cockneys put an h in a sentence where it didn’t belong — ‘I broke my harm’ — polite society took it out again.

Skip forward 500 years and the wheel has come full circle. In the Eighties, people began to talk in Estuary English — the result of East Enders moving up in the world and wanting to sound less Cor Blimey. What they ended up with was a weird amalgam of Cockney and Received Pronunciation.

As accents multiplied, so people became more and more adept at identifying them. George Bernard Shaw based Professor Higgins in Pygmalion — who claimed to be able to place a person’s origins within six miles, and sometimes within two streets in London — on a real-life professor of phonetics at University College, London.

It was only a matter of time before phonetics went into showbusiness. In the Forties, a radio series went out in the U.S. called Where Are You From? in which a man called Henry Lee Smith would try to identify people’s accents. Guests were given a list of 20 words to say, including ‘very’, ‘wash’ and ‘greasy’. Smith regularly got seven out of ten correct.

David Crystal is Honorary Professor of Linguistics at the University of Bangor, and Ben is an actor who curated the British Library’s CD, Shakespeare’s Original Pronunciation. For some reason — presumably because they thought it would make everything sound bright and snappy — their narrative keeps switching from one to the other, with cheery little sign-offs such as: ‘Over to you Pops.’ Although this works surprisingly well at first, it soon runs out of steam.

Yet there is still a lot of fascinating stuff here. Plainly, we’re all obsessed by how we speak, even if — thanks to U.S TV — we’re increasingly shifting westwards. How many people now say ‘skedule’ instead of ‘schedule’?

At the same time, attitudes to Received Pronunciation are changing. Once it was the embodiment of decency and trustworthiness. Now it’s more likely to be seen as ‘distant’ and ‘customer unfriendly’. Some things, though, never change: snobbery and a desire to escape one’s background being two of them.

In 2012, a British private tuition company announced it received far more requests for elocution lessons than any other subject. So if you happen to be sitting on a bus on, say, the Birmingham inner ring road and hear someone reciting ‘how now brown cow’ over and over, don’t judge them too harshly: they’re only following a natural human impulse.
