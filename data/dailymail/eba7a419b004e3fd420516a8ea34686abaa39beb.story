Officials say a bear that attacked a 12-year-old girl near Cadillac earlier this month is not the same one that was shot two days later a couple of miles away.

The Michigan Department of Natural Resources said that DNA from the bear's carcass did not match fur and saliva samples taken from clothing that Abby Wetherell was wearing when she was attacked and mauled on August 15th.

The tests showed that the bear that harmed Abby was a female, while the bear that was killed was a male.

Brave: Abby Wetherell, from Michigan, miraculously survived the bear attack by playing dead but sustained deep gashes and puncture wounds to her thighs and back

Injuries: The animal knocked the girl down twice and lashed one of her thighs with its powerful paws as she screamed for help

Abby was jogging on a trail near her 
grandfather's cabin in a wooded area of Wexford County when the bear 
came after her. About 100 stitches were needed to close her wounds.

She
sped up, but the bear knocked her down twice and lashed one of her 
thighs with its powerful paws as she screamed for help. Her father and a
neighbor chased the animal away.

She miraculously survived the bear attack by playing dead but
sustained deep gashes and puncture wounds to her thighs and back.

The attack happened on grandfather Dave Wetherell's wooded property near Cadillac.

Dave
Wetherell, Abby's grandfather, tells the Detroit Free Press that 
Abigail Wetherell is a strong person who realizes 'she was in a lot of 
danger and she beat it.'

Abigail was treated for abrasions and puncture wounds before being released from a Traverse City hospital.

The DNR says the search for the bear is continuing.

Wanted: The black bear knocked the girl down twice and lashed one of her thighs with its powerful claws before fleeing into the woods

Speaking to Good Morning America last week she said: 'I see this bear. Oh, my gosh. I start running the way I was coming 
from. All of a sudden, the bear stopped me and put me down 
on ground, scraping me and clawing me.

'I was terrified. I was thinking, "I shouldn't have went for this jog. This is it, I'm a goner'."

The bear suddenly stopped attacking 
her and she took the chance to get up and run away but the bear came 
back. She decided to pet it to see if she could get the animal to like 
her.

'That did not work. Then it just got me again.

'And then I heard that you should 
play dead. So that's what I did,' she told GMA. 'And then it kind of 
went away and then it looked back and 
then it just took off.'

Her father Chris told GMA: 'I was in 
shock when I first saw her. I didn't believe it was a bear attack until I
saw the claw marks and bruises. It was horrible.'

Abby was taken to hospital and had to get 100 stitches on her wounds over two hours of surgery. She is recovering at home.

She said of her injuries: 'When the bear was attacking me, I couldn't feel it. I was 
just numb. I don't know how or why but my whole body went numb and when I
started getting up it hurt bad.

'It's over. But, I'm not going to go in the woods without anybody. I'm OK and I'll be all right.'

Father Chris Wetherell said: 'I was in shock when I first saw her. I didn't believe it was a bear attack until I saw the claw marks and bruises. It was horrible'

Back home: Abby Wetherell is now recovering from the attack at home after undergoing two-hour surgery

Tough cookie: Abby, who is a hunting enthusiast, a soccer goalie, and loves the great outdoors, plans to return to the site of the bear attack in the near future - but not on her own

People who venture into likely bear territory should carry pepper spray, travel in small groups and make noise to avoid startling them, the DNR said.

‘If you encounter a bear, stand your ground and then slowly back away,’ the agency said in a news release. ‘Do not turn away.’

It advised people not to show fear, run or play dead, but instead to make themselves look as big as possible and talk to the animal in a stern voice.
