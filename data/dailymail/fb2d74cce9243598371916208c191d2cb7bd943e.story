Police in Connecticut say a hoarder has died after the cluttered first floor of her home collapsed into the basement.

Authorities
 say 66-year-old Beverly Mitchell was found dead in her Cheshire home 
Saturday, a day after a postal carrier called police to request a 
welfare check because her mail was piling up.

Cheshire police tell the Record-Journal that the first floor appeared to collapse under the weight of clutter
 stacked to the ceiling, and Mitchell was found in the basement under a 
pile of debris.

The home of a Connecticut hoarder (not pictured here) was so full the floor collapsed sending her falling to her death

'The floor gave way and collapsed into the basement.
 The contents of that room caved in on top of her,' Sgt. Kevin 
O’Donnell told the press.

'We did a well being and we determined it wasn’t 
safe to continue searching and asked for assistance when we saw the 
first floor collapsed,' he added. 'We contacted Connecticut 
Homeland, who brought special equipment for search and rescue.'

Authorities cut their way into the home through a side wall. State officials also responded to the scene.

They finally found her body on Saturday. 

'She was a hoarder,' said O’Donnell. 'This was an accidental death caused by disrepair.'

The chief medical examiner's office will be performing an autopsy.

O'Donnell said authorities had attempted to reach out to her for years, but that she had a long history of reclusive behavior and shunned contact with the outside world aside for occasional shopping trips or visits to senior services.

Her home had even been boarded up.

'She was a recluse,' he said. 'We weren’t sure she was in the building'

Police and social service agencies had tried for years to help Mitchell, O’Donnell said.
