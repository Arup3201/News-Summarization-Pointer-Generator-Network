It is the ruthless game of property ownership, which sees the ambitious snap up sites in the most expensive areas while others make do with the cheaper, less lucrative streets.

But homeowners are playing a real life game of Monopoly according to researchers who have highlighted the dramatic differences in house prices between the highest and lowest priced districts.

It reveals the average home in upmarket Kensington costs some 13 times more than Blaenau Gwent in South Wales.

Median house prices ranged from £975,000 in Kensington and Chelsea, to £72,000 in Blaenau Gwent, according to the Office for National Statistics

Over the last 20 years, homes in Kensington and Chelsea have soared by 400 per cent - compared to less than 150 per cent in Blaenau Gwent

Terraced houses in Liverpool cost less than a deposit for homes in Kensington and Chelsea, the ONS said

The Office for National Statistics has produced the Monopoly-style graphics to shed light on the vast differences in house prices between different parts of the country.

The ONS said: 'For the 348 local authorities in England and Wales in 2013, median house prices ranged from £975,000 in Kensington and Chelsea, to £72,000 in Blaenau Gwent.' 

Throughout the period from 1995, the council areas with the highest house prices tended to be in London and the South East, with the lowest spread across England and Wales.

For instance, homes in parts of West London have soared by 400 per cent over the past 20 years - compared to less than 150 per cent in the Welsh Valleys. 

'Since 1995 for local authorities nationally, the percentage difference between the highest and lowest median house prices has fluctuated considerably,' the ONS said. 

'This difference was smallest in 1995 at 517 per cent and reached nearly 1,400 per cent at its height in 2002. 

'This percentage gap has also been increasing year on year since 2006, having fallen between 2003 and 2006.'

A detached home in Westminster in central London now costs an average of £3.8million. Leeds meanwhile has the highest number of commuters outside the capital

At £115,000, terraced houses in Birmingham cost more than in Liverpool - but almost nine times less than in trendy Islington, north London

Despite being one of the most desirable areas to buy a house in the whole of the UK, Westminster has the highest crime rate

On average, house prices in the UK have increased by 6.9 per cent a year since 1980 – with just seven years when the properties fell in value.

In the past 35 years, the biggest increase in house prices was 25.6 per cent in 1988, while the biggest drop was 7.6 per cent in 2009. 

According to the Office for National Statistics, the average UK house price reached £272,000 in December, which is £2,000 less than at its peak last summer but £1,000 more than the previous month.

London prices are almost double this at £502,000, although this is also some way off its record high of £514,000 last August.

While prices in the capital rose by 13 per cent in the last 12 months, this is a much slower than last summer when annual house price inflation hit 20 per cent.

In the surrounding counties, house price growth is rapidly catching up with London, rising by 12 per cent in the south east, 11 per cent in the east and 9 per cent in the south-west.
