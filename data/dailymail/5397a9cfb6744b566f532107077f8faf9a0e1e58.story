Roberto Mancini has implored Yaya Toure to move to Italy in the summer as he wants the midfielder to become his lynchpin at Inter Milan.

The Ivorian's future at Manchester City has been an ongoing concern since the summer and it appeared he would be on his way.

The situation appears to have settled in recent months - he has won games on his own for City this season - but whether the Etihad Stadium will be home to the 31-year-old much longer remains up in the air.

Yaya Toure should move to Serie A in Italy, claims Inter Milan manager Roberto Mancini

The pair won the Premier League title together as Manchester City became a powerhouse in England

And Mancini, who signed Toure from Barcelona back in 2010, wants him to think about a move to the San Siro.  

'Yaya is one of the best players in the world,' Mancini said in an interview with Il Giornale. 'He still would be [if he came to Italy]. He's played for a lot of teams.

'He's been to Belgium, Russia, Spain and England, but he's missing Italy. It could be a good opportunity for him to come and try.' 

The midfielder is currently away at the Africa Cup of Nations with Ivory Coast

While it is highly unlikely that Toure will forego Champions League football - Inter are way behind the top four in Serie A - but Mancini believes they could actually lure him to the club.

'We're building, but there are players who can immediately change the face of a team and Yaya is one of them,' he added. 

'Next year we can prove ourselves, with three signings you'll see that we'll be ready for the Scudetto fight.
