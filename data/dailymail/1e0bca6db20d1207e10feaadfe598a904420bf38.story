Abuse: Michelle Knight, pictured, was treated like a 'punching bag' in her years of captivity, according to a family friend of one of the victims

Michelle Knight, the first of three women to be kidnapped off the street who suffered more than a decade of abuse in a Cleveland house of horrors, was subjected to numerous beatings and treated like 'a punching bag,' a family friend of one of the victims has revealed.

Miss Knight vanished in August 2002, and was not seen again until earlier this month when she emerged from a dilapidated house on Seymour Avenue with Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus.

The owner of the home, 52-year-old Ariel Castro, faces kidnapping and rape charges. He is accused of chaining up all three women in the home and raping them.

A family friend of one of the victims told CNN that Michelle was often hit hit with hand weights and other objects and treated like a 'punching bag' for 11 years.

Her relatives say that she is deaf in one ear, and may need facial reconstruction surgery. She was released from a hospital on Friday.

Knight, 32, stayed in the hospital for several days after the other two women left.

Michelle told CNN in a statement: 'I am healthy, happy and safe and will reach out to family, friends and supporters in good time.'

She told police that her alleged captor repeatedly raped her and caused her to miscarry at least five times over the years by starving her and punching her in the stomach.

Police sources told the National Enquirer that Castro had no interest in having children with Knight, because she was only 4-foot-7 and he believed her to be 'mentally disabled.'

The magazine's source added that he was grooming his 6-year-old daughter with Amanda, Joselyn, as another sex slave because the other captives 'were getting to old for him.'

The startling claims come after a female police officer has described the moment she rescued Miss Knight, now 32.

Barbara Johnson was one of the first Cleveland police officers to rush into Ariel Castro's house on Seymour Avenue after Amanda Berry managed to escape and call 911.

When she found Michelle, the woman grabbed her tightly and begged her not to leave her, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports.

'Michelle hugged me first, then 
clutched me and said, "Don't let me go",' Johnson said at an awards 
ceremony for the officers involved in the miraculous rescue. 'You can't 
really describe how I felt...it rips the heart out of my chest.'

The
rescue of Michelle, Amanda and Gina DeJesus a decade after they were 
all feared dead has been called the 'Miracle in Cleveland'.

For the officers who arrived at Castro's home on May 6, it was also a brush with unimaginable horror.

'When I heard there were people in the house, I ran up to the door, but it was locked from the inside,' Officer Michael Simon recalled. 'So I grabbed the hand rail by the stairs to use as a prying tool...but the other officers kicked the door in.

'Once inside, I felt evil in the house.'

Even the veteran officers who are 
confronted with human tragedy on a frequent basis could not ignore the 
emotional impact of rescuing the three girls from a decade of captivity.

'I've broke down 
(crying) a few times on the scene, and in private since then,' Officer 
Anthony Espada - the first officer on the scene - admitted. 'Those three
girls are my heroes... after what went through in that house all those 
years.'

It emerged yesterday that Michelle and Gina DeJesus will require long-term therapy for
injuries such as hearing loss and joint and muscle damage due to the 
severe abuse they were subjected for more than a decade.

Their injuries were compared to those
suffered by prisoners of war and sources said there were chains coming 
from the wall in the basement and dog leashes attached to the ceiling.

The women were restrained with them and duct tape in 'stress positions' 
for long periods that left them with bed sores and other injuries, 
according to two sources with direct knowledge of the investigation.

Other reports said that Amanda Berry was saved from the worst of the abuse because she was a favorite of Castro's.

Officer Anthony Espada, the first police officer to arrive at the scene, said he has broken down and cried several times since helping to rescue the girls

'There is a reason why you have only seen a picture of Amanda,' said one
of the sources, referring to the condition of DeJesus and Knight.

Amanda, who broke down a door to freedom a week ago with the help of neighbors, then told police of the other women, was photographed 
smiling immediately after the dramatic rescue. Berry has a six-year-old 
daughter fathered by Castro in captivity.

In contrast, DeJesus wore a hooded sweat-shirt covering her head when 
she first went home last week, and Knight was hospitalized for days, and
has stayed out of public view.

The sources said DeJesus and Knight were gaunt and had closely cropped hair when they were freed.

Police had not been looking for Knight when she was found in Castro's house.

She disappeared in 2002 at age 21. Her mother concluded she might have run away from home because she was angry about the state taking away her child.

Police dropped the case when they couldn't reach her mother.
