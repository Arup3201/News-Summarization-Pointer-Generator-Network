A Scottish couple accused of causing the death of their toddler son after traces of methadone and an anti-depressant were found in his body have gone on trial in Tenerife.

Corinna Reid, 35, and her ex-partner Robert Cormack, 40, face up to 14 years in jail if convicted of 16-month-old Aiden's homicide.

Aiden's January 2007 death at the Paraiso Floral Hotel in the popular resort of Adeje on the Canary Island was originally blamed on bronchitis.

But Spanish detectives asked their Scottish counterparts to arrest his parents at their home in Edinburgh in January 2009 after toxicology tests showed traces of heroin substitute methadone and an anti-depressant in his body.

Mr Cormack did not oppose extradition and was sent back to Spain where he was remanded in custody.

Ms Reid fought extradition but was eventually sent back to Tenerife despite telling Edinburgh Sheriff's Court Aiden's dad had allegedly confessed to leaving drugs around their hotel room within reach of Aiden.

She was freed on bail ahead of the start of the trial but told she must stay on the island.

Leaked documents revealed that ex-heroin addict Mr Cormack had allegedly told Spanish judges his son had ingested the drugs accidentally mixed up in a glass of orange juice.

He has since split from Aiden's mum.

Ms Reid's lawyer had apparently hoped to agree an out of court settlement at the eleventh hour.

Ms Reid's Madrid-based lawyer Christian Mesia claimed that the high profile case of missing Madeleine McCann led prosecutors to charge Ms Reid with homicide in connection with the death of her son Aiden

But the trial, scheduled to finish today in front of a jury after three days of evidence, began on Monday without any agreement having been reached.

Speaking this morning outside court, Ms Reid's Madrid-based lawyer Christian Mesia, said: 'Neither Robert or Corinna should be on trial for homicide.

'Aiden's death was the result of Robert's negligence. It wasn't intended and was a tragic accident.

'They're being tried on a homicide charge because of the stubbornness of the court and the state prosecutor.

'Missing Madeleine McCann was being flashed up on the television every day the year Aiden died.

'I'm sure that's played a part in why Corinna is in front of a jury in court this week charged with homicide.'

Speaking last month, Ms Reid protested her innocence.

She said: 'I am not guilty. I thought my son had died of natural causes until Robert told me about the glass of juice after the results of the lab tests were known. It was a complete shock.

'This is all a nightmare. How can they want me to go to prison for 14 years for something I knew absolutely nothing about?'

Lawyer Mr Mesia has claimed in the past: 'The father claims he opened the boy's mouth and saw that there was no trace of any of the liquid in his mouth.

'But instead of calling a doctor or rushing the infant to hospital he just washed and changed the lad, cleaned up the mess and said nothing about the incident.

'The first Corinna heard about this was seven months later when after the results of the lab tests came through.

'There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of any negligence or irresponsible behaviour on Corinna's part.'

The case continues.
