Drawing comparisons with his younger brother, Freddie Burns shows a rare moment of self-doubt.

The Leicester No 10 has been keeping a close eye on his sibling, Billy, who is breaking through into the senior ranks at Gloucester.

‘He reminds me of myself a few years back,’ said Burns. ‘He’s got no fear and is full of confidence.

‘There’s a bit of a carefreeness and you can put mistakes down to naivety. Now any mistakes are punished because there’s an expectation level, but I’m happy with that.’

Freddie Burns hasn't had the start to life at Leicester he hoped for but is showing signs of confidence

Burns featured in England's tour of New Zealand but has fallen back in the pecking order for the No 10

Confidence has never been an issue for Burns Snr, but the sometimes wizard-like fly-half admits there have been times of frustration since his summer move from Gloucester.

After playing a prominent role in England’s end-of-season tour of New Zealand, the 24-year-old was overlooked for the autumn internationals. 

His slip down the England pecking order is linked to a stuttering start to life at Welford Road, where he has been named on the bench eight times in the last 11 games.

‘I’ve not quite hit the levels I wanted to, but it’s a long season and a lot can change,’ said Burns.

‘I’ve probably not played as much as I would have liked, so I just want a run of games to get my confidence back. Not that my confidence has gone… but it’s a different ball game when you’re starting every week.’

Owen Farrell was first-choice fly-half at the start of the autumn but has suffered a lack of game time

George Ford: The Bath youngster has shown that he is not too small for Test rugby and is enjoying a consistent run of good form. Can take the ball up to the gainline, but can also orchestrate play from deep.

Owen Farrell: First choice at the start of the autumn, but a lack of form and game-time saw the Saracens No 10 dropped. A cool head with the boot and a solid defender, lacks attacking spark of his challengers.

Stephen Myler: Hard to ignore the man who is helping to keep Northampton at the top of the table, but too conservative and would not scare the Southern Hemisphere big three. At 30, he offers a calm head with more experience than his rivals.

Danny Cipriani: A popular choice after some impressive performances at Sale, but does not seem to be in Stuart Lancaster’s plans. Lacks consistency, but has the attacking wizardry to turn a game on its head from the bench.

Freddie Burns: Similar to Cipriani in terms of his eccentric style but does not carry the weight of celebrity baggage. A major lack of game-time at Leicester means Burns has had little chance to turn the heads of the England selectors.

Henry Slade: The uncapped wildcard has been compared to Dan Carter by Exeter Chiefs team-mate Dean Mumm. Can operate at No 10 or in the centres and seems to have the full attacking and defensive repertoire at club level.

Expectation levels were high for Burns after his much-hyped arrival from the West Country. The five-cap international was expected to rediscover his mojo behind a dominant Tigers pack, become a Welford Road favourite and re-assert himself in the international set-up, where many had tipped him to become England’s next big success story.

Yet Burns seems to have slipped temporarily out of Stuart Lancaster’s plans, with Sunday’s opponent George Ford being the man in firm possession of the No 10 jersey.

Burns offers moments of flash-in-the-pan brilliance, but Ford has shown superior ability to consistently manage the game.

Ford came out on top at The Rec in September, when Leicester were beaten 45-0 and Burns was left to reflect on one of the most painful defeats of his career.

For the Tigers, revenge is very much on the cards.

Burns' ability to produce moments of brilliance aren't in doubt but George Ford's been more reliable

‘It was probably my worst day in a rugby shirt,’ said Burns. ‘My friends and family are all from Bath, so they pay a bit more attention to it. I took a fair bit of stick and rightly so.

‘It wasn’t fun to play in, but we feel like a much stronger team now. If you come off the pitch after losing 45-0, then it’s always going to be a pretty dark day.

‘Now we can use the result as motivation, but you can’t get too caught up in that way of thinking. I used to get too carried away with these games when I was at Gloucester, but you can’t let yourself do that. Now I just try and look at it as just another game… maybe with a little extra spice.’

As has been the case in most of Leicester’s recent big games, director of rugby Richard Cockerill has backed Welsh youngster Owen Williams to call the shots at No 10 this afternoon. It was a similar case last month, when Burns played in an A League fixture just two days after being left out of the starting XV for the Champions Cup tie with Toulon. Things may not be going to plan, yet his natural aura of confidence still comes through.

Freddie's brother Billy Burns, who is playing for Gloucester, shows a no fear attitude and confidence

Freddie says the way Billy plays with freedom reminds him of himself a few years ago

‘I didn’t see coming here as a quick fix,’ said Burns. ‘But I back my own skills and I believe I’m good enough to be in and around that England mix.

‘I like to think that, the majority of time I’ve played for England, I’ve performed reasonably well.

‘I know I’m capable and I’ve got full confidence in my ability. I didn’t expect to come to Leicester and for someone to wave a magic wand, make me England’s number one and suddenly it’s all rosy. I knew I would have to compete for my place.

‘It’s a different way of life up here and it’s a long-term process. Everyone would like to change club, hit the ground running and be starting for England, but that’s not how it works. If I’m starting for Leicester week in, week out, then I’ve got full confidence that I can be around that squad.’
