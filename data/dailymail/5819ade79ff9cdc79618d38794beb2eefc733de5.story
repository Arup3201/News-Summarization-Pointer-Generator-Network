Michael Carrick is someone who refuses to waste, declines any sort of 50/50 and, ultimately, is the man to make Manchester United tick.

A midfielder whose influence has been overlooked time and again has proven since his return what Louis van Gaal had been missing. It is no coincidence that United have won all five of their Premier League games since the 33-year-old regained his fitness and place in the starting XI.

Because, when you look at the difficulties they previously endured, this is a season which threatened to peter out before it had even begun. 

Michael Carrick has vastly improved Manchester United's midfield since returning from injury 

Carrick's inclusion in the United midfield since the start of November has yielded five straight wins

Gone are the sights of United surrendering possession in the middle of the park, incapable of building any sort of momentum and failing to provide Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie with any sort of consistent service.

And while nowhere near their best at Southampton on Monday night, the Red Devils are a side reborn with Carrick beating the drum.

The influence of Carrick cannot be understated and is finally yielding the recognition it deserves. 

‘It might look like a really simple thing but Michael Carrick is a very good passer of the ball forwards,’ Gary Neville said on Monday Night Football.

‘People probably didn’t like it a few weeks ago when I was a little critical of Daley Blind but United have missed this – the passes around the corner and the difference this makes in setting up an attack is incredible.’
