Warning: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has warned that gay marriage could put Anglicans around the world in danger

A Church of England decision to accept gay marriage would be ‘absolutely catastrophic’ for Christians in troubled countries, the Archbishop of Canterbury said yesterday.

Anglicans in countries such as South Sudan, Nigeria and Pakistan are in danger as a result of liberal positions taken by the leaders of churches in the west, he said.

The Most Reverend Justin Welby said he had visited a grave containing 369 bodies in South Sudan, where some people believed ‘if we leave a Christian community here we will all be made to become homosexual and so we will kill all the Christians’.

He said on an LBC radio phone-in that while he was deeply concerned with the suffering of gay people in Britain, the issue of gay rights was not simple.

The Archbishop and other CofE leaders have given regular hints of a softened line on homosexuality, and a high-level Synod report has said clergy should be able to conduct blessings for gay couples.

He told a caller who said vicars should be allowed to make up their own minds on gay weddings: ‘What we say here is heard around the world. Why can’t we just do it now?

‘Because the impact of that on Christians in countries far from here, like South Sudan, like Pakistan, Nigeria and other places would be absolutely catastrophic and we have to love them as much as the people who are here.

‘I’ve stood by a graveside in Africa of a group of Christians who’d been attacked because of something that had happened far, far away in America. And they were attacked by other people because of that.

‘The mass grave had 369 bodies in it and I was standing with the relatives. That burns itself into your soul, as does the suffering of gay people in this country.’

Dilemma: The Archbishop said he had agonised over his support for gay rights issues

The Archbishop said gay rights was ‘really not a simple issue’ and added: ‘It’s something that I wrestle with every day and often in the middle of the night.’

‘We have to listen incredibly carefully to the LGBT communities here . . . and we have to look at the tradition of the Church, and the teaching of the Church, and the teaching of scripture, which is definitive in the end, before we come to a conclusion.

‘But we’re not in a position just to suddenly say, okay our position in this country has changed.’

The Archbishop is the head of the worldwide Anglican communion, which has nearly 80million worshippers and is highly influential in countries in Africa and Asia where the confrontation between Islam and Christianity is often violent.

Celebration: But gay marriage poses a danger to Anglicans in countries such as South Sudan and Pakistan, Mr Welby said

One caller on the phone-in show was former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe, who left the Church of England for the Roman Catholic church in 1993 after the CofE chose to ordain women as priests.

Miss Widdecombe suggested to the Archbishop that his ‘heart has just sunk’ after hearing her voice. She said she left the CofE partly because it ‘never seems to know what it thinks about anything’.

He replied: ‘I think I’m right, you think I’m wrong. We differ.’
