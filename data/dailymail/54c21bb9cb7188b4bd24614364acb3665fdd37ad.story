A Detroit family is demanding justice for their daughter and sister — after the newlywed 25-year-old was tragically killed when a parolee leading cops in a high-speed chase broadsided her car.

Francesca Vitale Weatherhead was driving to her job as a sales manager when the man ran a red light on his Ford Escape and struck her car on Oct. 6.

Her accused killer: 27-year-old John McCallum, who has a mile-long rap sheet for a series of charges including break-ins, possession of weapons and drugs and larceny.

McCallum had been paroled not five months prior — despite being sentenced to a maximum of 20 years in prison on his latest break-in and drug possession arrest, the Detroit Free Press reported.

He was fleeing Livonia police in the course of yet another  home invasion.

'It just baffles my mind that someone with that history was even allowed out,' Kristina Vitale told the Free Press. 

'He's being tried for his fourth serious offense? Does it take a life...to keep someone behind bars?'

Mother Angela Vitale sobbed as she remembered her baby girl. 

'Why, why was he let out?' she wailed.

'They should be held responsible — whoever let him out should be held responsible,' she told the Free Press.

McCallum had first been eligible for parole in September 2013 but was held longer because authorities thought he needed to complete a violence prevention program.

Yet he was released just months later.

The Michigan Department of Corrections says McCallum 'successfully completed the program with a very positive overall assessment.

'However, predicting human beings' future behavior can be a very difficult task,' department spokesman Russ Marlan told the Free Press. 'Unfortunately, some of the individuals they parole end up not being successful and some end up hurting innocent citizens.

'I know personally that these cases have a significant impact on the individual parole board members involved — they anguish deeply over these cases.'

Francesca and Matthew Weather had just found a new house to start their lives together when she was killed

The day of her accident, Francesca had been traveling for work as part of her job as a sales manager for tobacco company Altria.

She had just married Matthew Weatherhead in June, and was  putting her husband through medical school at MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine.

To her family, Francesca was the 'angelic one,' they told the Free Press.

'My sister was my whole world — she was my everything,' sister Nina Vitale told the Free Press. 'I just want justice.'

The two met at Michigan State University, where Matthew Weatherhead was going to medical school

The family says they harbor no ill feelings against the police officer who was chasing McCallum when the accident the happened. The cop has been heartbroken over the crash and had to take a leave of absence, the family says.

'I want her to know we don't blame her,' mother Angela Vitale told the Free Press. 'She was doing her job.'

Francesca graduated from Trenton High School, where she played softball and was named homecoming queen, according to The News Herald. 

She went on to attend Michigan State University and graduated in 2010 with a degree in business administration and marketing.

Francesca and Matthew were married in June, just months before she was killed in the horrific crash
