Hundreds of Palestinians have been evacuated from their homes after heavy flooding, caused by rain and drainage issues, caused water levels in Gaza Valley to rise by up to 10 feet.

Nearly 80 families were forced to flee to a nearby UN refugee shelter as areas on the Gaza Strip were swamped under the muddy water.

Children and elderly people had to help clear some of the water from the roads using small buckets, while horses and carriages were also being used to get personal belongings and family members through the murky brown sludge.

The floods led to false accusations that Israel had opened up dams along the river to intentionally cause the flooding, even though no dams exist in southern Israel.

A spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Palestinian Territories (COGAT) told VICE News: 'These claims, I don't know who started them, but they are completely false.

'There are no dams in the southern part of Israel so we couldn't open any dams because there aren't any. I don't know how these rumours got around.'

In an unrelated incident, an Israeli power company cut electricity in Nablus and Jenin, which are on the West Bank rather than Gaza, on the same day, for a short period of time.

The state-owned company said that they made the decision to cut power because the Palestinian government owes them $492 million. The Israel Electric Corporation said it had long warned about the debt.

A statement released by the company said: 'We limited for 45 minutes today the supply of electricity to five power lines in Nablus and Jenin.' 

Palestinians claimed that Israeli authorities opened dams along the river, causing water to rush down into a number of villages - but Israel said there are no dams to open

Some of the evacuated families have been set up in nearby shelters for Palestinian refugees, which are sponsored by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).

They will be provided with food and drink, but do not know when they can return home.  

In 2010 and December 2013 flooding  forced 100 families from their homes. At the time local defence services said they saved seven people who had been at risk of drowning.

The UN also had to declare a state of 'emergency' in Gaza City last November after two days of heavy rain caused flooding in the war-ravaged area. 

Some 100,000 Palestinians also remain homeless across Gaza after a bloody 50-day war between Israeli and Hamas militants destroyed homes, roads and services.

UNRWA said in January that it cannot afford to repair the homes damaged last year because donors have failed to pay.

It said in a statement: 'The agency has exhausted all funding to support repairs and rental subsidies.

'$5.4 billion (£3.5bn) was pledged at the Cairo aid conference last October and virtually none of it has reached Gaza. This is distressing and unacceptable.'

Allegations that Israel had caused the flooding by opening dams were rejected, as there are no dams in southern Israel

An earlier version of this article stated that Israel had opened river dams in the south of the country, causing flooding in the Gaza strip. In fact, there are no dams in southern Israel and the flooding was caused by rain and drainage issues. We are happy to clarify this.
