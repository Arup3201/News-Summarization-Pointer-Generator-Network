Threatened: Cindy Lee Garcia was the first actress to speak out against the film after it caused deadly protests in the Middle East

The first actress to speak out against the director of the incendiary anti-Islam film that prompted global protests is now fearful for her life after receiving multiple death threats.

Cindy Lee Garcia was quick to announce that she and the other actors had no idea that the film's producer, who they knew at Sam Bacile but who is now known by his true name of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, wanted to use their acting to create an anti-Islam film but now she is being threatened.

'I’m getting horrible death threats over the Internet, people saying they’re going to cut me up, chop me up and kill me and my family,' Ms Garcia said on Tuesday.

Her personal Facebook page, her 
professional modeling page, and the page of the Flame of Fire Outreach 
Church where she serves as an ordained minister have all been inundated 
with threats from individuals angered by the movie.

One such threat highlighted by The New York Daily News
reads that a man named Ahmad Nazir Bashiri said the actress is lucky 
that he is nowhere near her because 'otherwise I would have cut your 
head no matter what your country or lawmakers would have done to me'. 

In her first interview, when she spoke to Gawker and
explained that she never saw any references to the prophet Mohammed or 
Islam, Ms Garcia thought that she was actin in a film called Desert 
Warriors.

‘It was going to 
be a film based on how things were 2,000 years ago. It wasn't based on 
anything to do with religion, it was just on how things were run in 
Egypt. There wasn't anything about Muhammed or Muslims or anything,’ she
told Gawker.

Outraged: Actress Cindy Lee Garcia said that she never knew that the movie, which she thought was titled Desert Warriors, was intended to be an anti-Islam film

Her Facebook page echoes that, as she proudly touts her participation in the film.

'I
have been doing feature films, just finished Broken Roads with Crevice 
Entertainment, also just wrapped up Dessert Warriors/ played a 
supporting role,' she wrote.

Hiding: She has received repeated death threats over her involvement with the film

She lists shooting as one of her hobbies, saying she is 'very good with guns, love shooting am A Member Of Kern County Gun Club. Spend as much time as I can on the gun range'.

After a 14-minute trailer of the film was posted online, protests broke out throughout the Middle East and U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens was killed inside the Libyan embassy last week.

The next day, Ms Garcia called the producer- who she still thought was named Sam Bacile- in a panic.

'I called Sam and said, "Why did you do this?" and he said, "I'm tired of radical Islamists killing each other. Let other actors know it's not their fault,"' Garcia said.

She is furious about the changes that were made after filming, as the final product refers to Mohammed as a pedophile and child molester.

‘I had nothing to do really with anything. Now we have people dead because of a movie I was in. It makes me sick,’ she said.

Though she spoke to ‘Sam’ and he acknowledged that none of the actors knew what was going on, that is not enough for her.

‘I’m going to sue his butt off,’ she said.

In
her latest interview, Ms Garcia told The New York Daily News that she 
and her family are beign forced to go into hiding and she will be taking
an assumed name.

'We're 
looking for a new place to live right now. My husband is really worried.
All my family is in hysterics,' she told the paper.

She
said that she called the FBI and left messages reporting the threats 
she has been receiving but she has yet to hear back from the agency.

In the days following the protests, the true identity and criminal background of the film's producer Nakoula Basseley Nakoula has been revealed.

Nakoula is an Egyptian-born Coptic Christian. Now living in California, he is a convicted drug dealer and conman who was last released from jail in June last year.

Ms Garcia was the first but not the only actress involved in the project who has expressed her outrage at the final version of the film.

Anna Gurji, 21, who plays Muhammad’s 
child bride, spoke yesterday of her fear of reprisals and how she was 
‘betrayed’ by Nakoula.

‘I 
was playing the youngest bride of a character named George,’ she said. 
‘I had no idea George would be changed to Muhammad. I’m locked up in my 
house. I’m terrified people in the Middle East will blame me.

‘I’m Catholic so they might think I 
have something against Muslims. I’m taking pills to sleep. I’ve been 
crying for days. I feel betrayed. My face is stuck on the movie clip. 
People see that awful film and they see me.’

An
unnamed representative for the 80-person cast released a statement to 
CNN, condemning the incendiary changes made in post-production that 
portrayed the prophet Muhammed as a pedophile and child molester.

‘We
are shocked by the drastic re-writes of the script and lies that were 
told to all involved. We are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have 
occurred,’ the cast said in their statement.

'Betrayed': Anna Gurji said she was misled over the film's true contents

The
film sparked a violent protest at the U.S. consulate in the Libyan city
of Benghazi during which the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans 
were killed on Tuesday. Protests have spread to other countries across 
the Muslim world.

For 
many Muslims, any depiction of the prophet is blasphemous. Caricatures 
deemed insulting in the past have provoked protests and drawn 
condemnations from officials, preachers, ordinary Muslims and many 
Christians.

U.S. 
officials have said authorities were not investigating the film project 
itself, and that even if it was inflammatory or led to violence, simply 
producing it cannot be considered a crime in the United States, which 
has strong free speech laws.

Two
attorneys visited Nakoula's home hours before he was taken in for 
questioning. They said they were there to consult with him.

The
violent protests over the film in Libya caused mob attacks in Benghazi 
that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other American 
officials.

Nakoula pleaded
guilty to bank fraud in 2010 and was sentenced to 21 months in prison, 
to be followed by five years on supervised probation, court documents 
showed.

He was accused 
of fraudulently opening bank and credit card accounts using Social 
Security numbers that did not match the names on the applications, a 
criminal complaint showed. He was released in June 2011, and at least 
some production on the video was done later that summer.

But
the terms of Nakoula's prison release contain behavior stipulations 
that bar him from accessing the Internet or assuming aliases without the
approval of his probation officer.

A
senior law enforcement official in Washington has indicated the 
probation investigation relates to whether he broke one or both of these
conditions. Violations could result in him being sent back to prison, 
court records show.
