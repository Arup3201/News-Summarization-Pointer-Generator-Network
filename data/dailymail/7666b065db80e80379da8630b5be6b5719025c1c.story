Accused: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe faces calls to resign over claims he leaked details

Britain's top police officer was accused by a senior Tory MP last night of ‘undermining the judicial process’ in a growing row over the Andrew Mitchell ‘Plebgate’ affair.

Scotland Yard Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe faces calls to resign over claims he leaked details on the progress of an inquiry into the controversy.

He is also accused of breaking his own rules by not recording meetings with journalists.

The inquiry into the Plebgate incident last September – which cost Mr Mitchell his job as Tory chief whip – looked into whether there was criminal misconduct by any of the officers involved. A file has been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service.

Tory MP David Davis has now accused Sir Bernard of briefing reporters that the investigation found no evidence that the officers lied.

Mr Mitchell admits swearing at officers who refused to let him cycle through the main gate to Downing Street, but denies calling them ‘plebs’.

The Commissioner met journalists twice in late March, and Mr Mitchell was furious when stories appeared claiming the police inquiry had turned up no evidence to support him, because it suggests he lied.

In a letter, Mr Davis has now accused Sir Bernard of ‘compounding’ the ‘assault on the reputation of Mr Mitchell’ by the officers involved.

And former Justice Minister Crispin Blunt said Sir Bernard’s position will be ‘untenable’ if it is found he leaked information on the inquiry to the media.

Mr Davis said information on any findings of the inquiry should have been ‘restricted’, and revealing it ‘undermines the judicial process and the public’s confidence in the impartiality of the system’.

He also accused Sir Bernard of breaking his own rules on engaging with the media by not recording the meetings with two newspapers.

A report by Elizabeth Filkin, the former Parliamentary standards commissioner, said police should record all conversations with journalists.

Asking about the media briefings, Mr Davis said: ‘Did you give them any grounds whatsoever to write that there was no evidence that police officers had lied? All of these questions would be unnecessary if you were able to provide a record of the conversations. This is, of course, a breach of the Filkin guidelines.

‘It is, even more seriously, a breach of the guidance that you issued to your own officers in May of last year.’

Mr Davis suggested the top officer may have been misleading when he claimed to have no direct knowledge of the Plebgate inquiry.

The MP said Sir Bernard received regular briefings on the progress of the controversial investigation from one of his most senior colleagues.

Mr Blunt said the affair is ‘very important’ because it drives to the heart of the integrity of police and public trust in their work. He told Channel 4 News Sir Bernard’s position is ‘very difficult to be tenable’ if he did leak details of the report.

He called on the officer to come clean on exactly what happened, saying it is a ‘wretched position’ for information to be ‘dragged out of him’.

Mr Blunt said: ‘He now needs to be absolutely transparent if he is going to be able to continue in his position.’

Mr Mitchell was furious at stories claiming the police inquiry turned up no evidence to support him because it suggests he lied. He admits swearing at armed officers who refused to let him cycle through the main gate to Downing Street, but denies using the word ‘pleb’.

As well as costing Mr Mitchell his job as chief whip, the row led to the arrest of three PCs, and one of their relatives, for offences including misconduct and leaking.

Friends of Mr Mitchell used Freedom of Information laws to reveal that Sir Bernard had a private meeting with journalists. The Met confirmed that the meetings took place but said no records were kept about exactly what was said.

The allegations are embarrassing for Sir Bernard because he has banned his officers from holding off-the-record conversations with the media.

He has said: ‘There should be no more secret conversations with journalists and officers should make a note of all meetings with reporters.’ 

But in an email to a senior Home Office official explaining his actions on the Plebgate row, Sir Bernard said no notes were kept. He said: ‘Because the terms of engagement for these meetings were that these were non-reportable briefings, we did not keep a note of the areas that were discussed.’ 

Scotland Yard opened a criminal inquiry after discovering an email from an independent witness to the Plebgate clash was in fact from an off-duty police officer who was not present. Detectives were tasked with discovering if information was deliberately leaked to the media and whether officers conspired to ‘stitch-up’ Mr Mitchell.

Mr Mitchell reacted angrily when articles were published about the progress of the inquiry in late March. He blamed the Met and described the leak as ‘a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career.’ 

In a statement, the Met admitted notes were not kept of the ‘not for publication’ meetings with journalists but will be in future.

A spokesman said the Commissioner had made ‘clear that he had not seen the file sent to the CPS and there was no compromise to any investigation’.
