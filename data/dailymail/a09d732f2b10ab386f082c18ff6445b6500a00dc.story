Last month Myleene Klass landed herself in hot water among Britain's middle class mums when she mocked an email sent to fellow parents asking for cash donations for a child's present.

Amid the fall-out - compounded by her own sarcastic response on social media - the 36-year-old was confronted at the school gates by mothers who felt betrayed, and was even ticked off in a round robin email from the £5,000-a-year school's headteacher.

But in a new interview with Fabulous magazine, the designer and Classic FM presenter said: 'This is why I keep getting myself in trouble. I can't keep my mouth shut. But that's who I am.'

Myleene Klass in 2011 with her daughter Ava, now seven, says she 'can't keep her mouth shut'

Opening up about her decision to post two emails from mothers of her seven-year-old daughter Ava's classmates, Myleene said: 'I want my children to receive yo-yos and give yo-yos, not Kindles. Being happy is not about stuff.

'I know it doesn't make me popular but this is what I stand for. I wasn't raised like that.'

The designer, who has a line of Littlewoods clothes, considered the potential backlash and reaction to posting the emails last month - which it has now emerged could be a year old - but went ahead anyway.

She shared two emails from her fellow mums which were sent out to help organise a group present for their daughters, with her 459,200 followers on Twitter and 75,000 on Instagram.

The messages, which Myleene posted under the hashtag #bonkers, soon went viral.

The first email read: ‘Jane and Hannah would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year. Sarah would like a Kindle and Lola a desk (very studious choices!) so if you would like to join in, please can I collect a suggested £10 from you before the party on February 9.

‘If you prefer to send £ via an envelope in your daughters [sic] school bag, marked for Jane/me that works too. I will pass on a voucher and card to each at the party. Thanx [sic] and no obligation of course.’

Myleene looked unworried by the furore at The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel premiere last week

A second email from another parent who offers to collect the cash reiterates that £10 would be a ‘popular amount’ to contribute – meaning that the total value of the gifts would be at least £200 – but adds: ‘Feel free to give what you like or indeed, to give your own gift.’

Myleene then posted her own response with the sarcastic heading, 'let's put the fun back into birthdays' saying she was going to collect money to buy Ava a unicorn and that she'd 'like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too.’

And making it clear she thought the original request was bad manners, she ended her retort by saying the money could be donated to a fictitious site – www.getwhatyoure-givenandendthismadness.com.

But the designer, who has her own Littlewoods brand of clothes, underwear, hair and beauty products, says she's undaunted by controversy, describing herself as 'fearless'.

Myleene Klass caused a backlash from mothers around the country when she posted fellow school mums' emails about collecting cash contributions for their daughter's presents

Myleene caused further outrage with her sarcastic response titled, 'Let's put the fun back into Bdays!'

She further explained her rationale in an article in the Telegraph, explaining she was 'amazed' by the emails when she first received them and posted - what she thought was - a 'humourous response'.

Myleene wrote: 'One mum did explain that she feels 26 presents is an awful lot for any child to get, and a lot of it is plastic rubbish. 

'She saw the email as problem-solving, and I understand what she meant, but the joy of getting a gift of some felt-tips and a yo-yo when you’re a kid can’t be diminished. Surely that’s what you’d rather have for your seventh birthday, not a Kindle or a desk.' 

Myleene, whose career was rebooted by starring on I'm A Celebrity and notably featured her showering in a white bikini, also opened up to Fabulous about the end of her marriage to celebrity minder Graham Quinn, the father of her two daughters and husband of six months.

She said that for the first year after their split, she was 'reeling from the heartache'.

But she believes in 'the sanctity of marriage', adding, 'you're either in or you're out, you can't just be half in it and because I believe in those things so strongly, when those beliefs are rocked you question so much.' 

Designer, Classic FM DJ and presenter Myleene is a single mother to Ava, seven, and Hero, three,
