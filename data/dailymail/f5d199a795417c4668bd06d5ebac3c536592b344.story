Britons have always been known for their stoicism.

And when these young men were sent to German prison camps during the First World War, they rolled up their sleeves and made the best of it.

Using the barbed wire parameter as a trellis, a group of gardeners transformed a bleak abandoned racecourse in the middle of the Ruhleben internment camp into a flourishing garden.

It began with the men growing sweet peas in biscuits tins, but they were soon using thousands of flowers to cover the harsh barbed wire which lined the camp

By the end of the war, the team were growing more than 80 different types of sweet peas, dahlias and chrysanthemums at the Berlin camp

It began with the men growing sweet peas in biscuits tins. But soon, they had set up a horticultural society and crafted their own 'mini Chelsea', using thousands of flowers which hung from the barbed wire.

They made their own greenhouses, installed their own boiler and set up their own cold frames. They even hosted their own internal flower shows, governed by RHS rules.

And, by the end of the war, the society - which had more than 900 members - was growing more than 80 different types of sweet peas, chrysanthemums and dahlias at the Berlin camp.

It was all made possible by the Royal Horticultural Society in London, with which the camp's dedicated horticultural society was affiliated since it began in 1916.

The RHS recruited help from volunteers to send packages of seeds and bulbs to the camp through the Red Cross.

Despite food being scarce - and being sent bulbs by the dozen - the gardeners focused more on flowers, attempting to turn the bleak camp into something more homely.

But they did more than just dabble in vegetable growing. At its peak, the society was producing 33,000 lettuces and 18,000 bunches of radishes, which they used to supplement their diet. 

They also produced pumpkins, cauliflower and potatoes, which they shared with fellow inmates  - and even sold some to the Germans.

Now, the story of one of those men is being featured as part of the Gardens at War exhibition at the Garden Museum in London.

David MacKay Tulloch, a merchant seaman, spent four years working on the garden at the camp -  a hobby he continued when he returned to the UK. 

His talent was passed through three generations, with his daughter Eva Tulloch and granddaughter Doreen Black both keen gardeners. His great-granddaughter Emily is now a garden designer.

Mr Tulloch's incredible story was discovered after the RHS launched a campaign, searching for relatives of the Ruhleben gardeners.

The society wanted their stories to be added to the photographs, letters and paintings sent to the RHS in London by  Ruhleben.

The gardeners also dabbled in growing fruit, which they even sold to some on the Germans in the camp

Doreen, 68, who lives in Dunblane, Scotland, said: 'He learnt all his gardening skills in Ruhleben and carried on when he returned home after the war.

'He always had big gardens to grow his fruit and vegetables and grew wonderful begonias and sweet peas. He was still gardening until he died at the age of 94.

'I have very strong memories of helping him pick strawberries. He'd always get me to whistle as I picked so I wouldn't be tempted to eat them.'

David Tulloch was sailing from Aberdeen to Hamburg with the merchant navy when war was declared in 1914.

He was incarcerated in hulks on the River Elb with his crew mates, until the Red Cross appealed and they were sent to Ruhleben.

He was among 5,000 British citizens at the overcrowded camp, which was described when it opened as 'scandalously inadequate' and 'not fit to keep pigs in.'

The prisoners worked together to transform the camp into a self-governing society, with its own newspapers, postal service and clubs.

The Ruhleben Horticultural Society, which had 900 members, was started in 1916 and became affiliated to the British RHS society.

Doreen added: 'The prisoners built all their own greenhouses and cold frames and even had a boiler, which they had to keep going through the night.

'They grew vegetables on about half the racecourse and grew huge numbers of cauliflowers and leeks and potatoes. In the end they were even selling vegetables to the Germans.

'It's amazing what they managed to achieve and how the gardening took off. They even had flower and vegetable shows following RHS rules.

'It was like a mini Chelsea in the middle of a German internment camp.' 

Tulloch's daughter Eva inherited his greenfingers and continued to garden until she was 90.

Today his great-granddaughter Emily Allen has become a garden designer and his great-grandson Duncan Black has a huge allotment.

'Grandpa passed on his knowledge and love of gardening to us all. I think he would be proud of Duncan's potato plot,' added Doreen.

Fiona Davison, head of Libraries and Exhibitions at the Royal Horticultural Society, says the society gradually grew from modest beginnings.

She said: 'The story of the Ruhleben Horticultural Society is a remarkable tale of the power of gardening to improve people’s quality of life, even in the most adverse conditions.

'Starting with miniature gardens in biscuit tins, the inmates of Ruhleben set up a flourishing horticultural society, complete with flower shows, nurseries, hot houses and eventually large scale food production.

'Throughout the war, the RHS mobilised its members and key nurseries to keep the Ruhleben Horticultural Society equipped with seeds, bulbs and advice.

'At its peak the Ruhleben Horticultural Society was producing 33,000 lettuces, 18,000 bunches of radishes and 7,000 pounds of green beans.

'By 1918 these efforts meant that the men in the camp had a much better diet than the native German population which was enduring severe food shortages.

'We put out an appeal to descendants of Ruhleben inmates and we were overwhelmed with responses. We hope that the resulting exhibition shines a light on this little known story from the First World War.'
