Six-year-old Isabella Barrett has earned more than $1million from her jewellery and make-up line in the past year.

The former Toddlers and Tiaras star chooses and test out items for the Glitzy Girl collection, which features lip glosses, charm bracelets and velour hoodies.

'It's a lot of fun,' the first grader told In Touch magazine. 'I'm the boss!'

The idea for Glitzy Girl came about during Isabella's pageant days.

Every
time the Rhode Island native won a beauty contest, she and her mother 
would get the title printed on a charm bracelet, 'so she could brag 
about her accomplishments,' explained Mrs Barrett.

Since
fans loved the look of her charms, Isabella and her mother took 
advantage of her popularity and launched the line.

To manage her daughter's huge earnings, Mrs Barrett has set up a trust fund that Isabella won't be able to access until she turns 18.

'I know Honey Boo Boo's mom wants to keep her grounded, but it's time for her to jump on the money train'

'I'm just trying to raise a happy, healthy little girl,' Mrs Barrett said.

But the mother-of-two seems to have no qualms about cashing in on her daughter's fame.

She even told In Touch that she thinks Honey Boo Boo, her Isabella's former Toddlers and Tiaras co-star, should take advantage of her stardom, too.

'I know her mom, June, wants to keep her grounded,' she said. 'But... it's time to jump on the money train.'

Successful six-year-old: Isabella is so busy running her company - which sells lip glosses, charms, bracelets and velour hoodies - that she's decided to take a break from pageants

Mrs Barrett explained that she and 
her daughter have always planned to use beauty pageants as a stepping
stone for other projects.

'It helped us pave the path to where we are now,' she explained.

During an appearance on The View last June, Mrs Barrett controversially slammed Toddlers and 
Tiaras for bringing 'nothing but negativity to Isabella,' who was in just one episode of the TLC series.

Though the show was no doubt the catalyst of her newfound fame, Mrs Barrett criticized it for its 'completely wrong' portrayal of child beauty stars.

The Barrett family are no strangers to controversy though.

In
one episode of the show, little Isabella accused her fellow junior 
beauty queen Paisley Dickey, three, of dressing like a 'hooker'.

And
eyebrows were raised when the six-year-old was caught on camera singing
and dancing along to 'I'm Sexy And I Know It' in a New York nightclub, 
her mother apparently egging her on.
