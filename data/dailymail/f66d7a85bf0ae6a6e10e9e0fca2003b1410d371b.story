She's the ex-Pussycat Doll turned X Factor icon and pop princess.

But anyone who thinks that Nicole Scherzinger doesn't have just as many body hang-ups and insecurities as the next woman, couldn't be more wrong.

The singer, 36, has opened up about the crippling self-doubt she felt throughout her dancer days in an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine and especially her battle with bulimia.

'Thinking about it I try not to well up,' she tells Jaqui Meddings of Cosmopolitan, of which Nicole is this month's cover star.

'It is such a horrible paralysing disease and it was such a dark time for me.

'That’s why I can empathise so much with people who have demons and voices in their heads, who aren’t nice to themselves. It robs you of living your life.'

Nicole goes on to explain how, even though it looked to the outside world as though she had the world at her feet, the eating disorder got so bad she started losing her voice and was found on more than one occasion passed out on the floor.

The Pussycat Dolls formed in 2004 and had huge chart-success from 2005 up to 2010, selling 50m records worldwide before their split that year.

Nicole was the lead singer and chief dancer of the troupe, though rumours of jealousy toward Nicole and tensions between the girls have been rife.

Fellow Pussycat Carmit Bacher claimed in 2013 that Nicole's eating disorder, which she hid from the group, led to tensions which eventually contributed to the group's demise.

Carmit once told MailOnline: 'Obviously people who have disorders like that are very good at hiding it.

'I feel stupid though not knowing. We were so close and I was shocked. I thought how could you hide that?'

Nicole revealed her battle with bulimia in 2012, during the height of her X Factor fame.

She told VH1: 'I never spoke about it, I never want to play a victim and I never wanted my family to hear about things from me because I think it would break their heart.'I guess it was like my addiction. I never did drugs, but kinda doing things to myself was my addiction.

'It’s like when I got off stage, I was on this high, and I’d come back to my room and I’d be alone, so I would just do things. My bulimia was my addiction; hurting myself was my addiction.'

Nicole joined the famous X Factor panel in 2011, where she sat alongside Gary Barlow and Louis Walsh for three years.

The full interview with Nicole appears in the August issue of Cosmopolitan, on sale 3rd July. Also available in digital edition on Apple Newsstands.  

Nicole's single 'Your Love' is out on 13th July.
