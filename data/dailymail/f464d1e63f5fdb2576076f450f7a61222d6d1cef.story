The former home of L. Ron Hubbard's third wife, Mary Sue Hubbard, can now be yours - allegedly only because her pet dog passed away last year.

CurbedLA reported last week on the now-available California home; it is currently listed for $2.495million.

The real estate website cited rumors posted in August 2013 by blog The Underground Bunker. The Scientology-focused website is managed by The Raw Story's executive editor Tony Ortega.

Homeowner: Mary Sue Hubbard, pictured, allegedly ordered in a will that her home could only be sold after her pet dog died

The home was allegedly a gift to Mary Sue Hubbard after she was released from prison in 1984 for a conspiracy conviction, and she lived there until her 2002 death, according to The Underground Bunker - which also alleged she was used as a fall guy to protect L. Ron Hubbard.

The blog cited a trust managed by her caretaker Neville Potter on behalf of her three children.

'Potter was one of four people who cared for Mary Sue in her final days,' the blog alleged. 'And there was another resident of the house that Mary Sue wanted to make sure would be taken care of in the style she was accustomed to.

'That was her white, fluffy Shih Tzu dog, named Tzu (and pronounced TEE-zoo).

'In her will, Mary Sue Hubbard requested that the house remain in the family as long as Tzu was alive.'

Tzu was looked after by Potter before dying last summer, the blog alleged.
