U.S. stocks plunged on Thursday, putting the market on track for its first monthly loss since January, as concerns mounted over the strength of overseas economies and ongoing tensions with Russia.

Investors responded to several weak earnings reports, escalating geopolitical instability and widespread views that stocks had become too expensive. They are also contemplating the likely end of the Federal Reserve's stimulus program this year.

The slide put major indexes into the red for July, leaving the market on track for its first monthly loss since January.

The Dow Jones industrial average fell 281 points, or 1.7 percent, to 16,599 as of 3:11 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow is headed for its biggest one-day loss since February.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 34 points, or 1.74 percent, to 1,935. The slide interrupted a prolonged advance in the market.

The S&P 500 hit its latest record high of 1,987.98 just one week ago, and is now 2.7 percent below that level. The Nasdaq composite dropped 85 points, or 1.9 percent, to 4,377.

Those gains had come despite rising 
political tensions between Russia and the West and an escalating war 
between Israel and the Palestinian Group Hamas.

'It's an accumulation of all these little things,' said Jerry Braakman, chief investment officer at First American Trust. 'People feel that we due for, not a major correction, but some sell-off in the three to 10 percent range.'

Russian news agencies reported that Russia has banned soy imports from Ukraine and may restrict Greek fruit and U.S. poultry in what could be responses to new Western sanctions.

The collapse of talks with U.S. creditors on Wednesday sent Argentina into its second debt default in 13 years and raised questions about what comes next for the South American nation's staggering economy.

The default sent Argentina’s Merval stock index plummeting on Thursday afternoon as it slumped 6.8 percent to 8,327.

Argentina’s credit rating was also downgraded to selective default by Standard & Poor’s on Wednesday.

Investors reacting to disappointing corporate earnings and outlooks from major U.S. companies including Exxon Mobil and Whole Foods Market, was also to blame.

Exxon Mobil fell $3.57, or 3.5 percent, to $99.70 after the energy company said that oil and gas production slipped six percent, disappointing analysts.

Oil and gas production fell to 3.84 million barrels of oil and gas per day from 4.15 million barrels last year.

The decline was driven by the expiration of rights to a field in Abu Dhabi and natural field declines.

Whole Foods Market fell 96 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.15 after reporting quarterly sales that fell shy of Wall Street expectations. The upscale grocer also lowered its sales forecast for the year.

That raised worries about the intensifying competition Whole Foods is facing. The company, based in Austin, Texas, has enjoyed growth as more Americans move to eat diets they feel are wholesome.

More recently, however, it products have become more mainstream.

Yum Brands slumped $3.84, or 5.3 percent, to $69.16 after the owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut fast-food chains said Thursday a food safety scandal in China that involved repacked meat has hurt sales and might be severe enough to cut into the company's global profit.

Yum said in a regulatory filing that it was too early to know when sales might rebound.
