American whistleblower Edward Snowden has been elected rector of on of the UK's oldest universities.

The computer analyst was nominated by a group of Glasgow University students who said they had received Snowden's approval through his lawyer.

The result of the ballot, which opened to students on Monday, was disclosed in Glasgow today.

The philosopher and economist Adam Smith (left), considered by many to be Scotland's greatest thinker, was rector of the university between 1787 and 1789. The political theorist and Parliamentarian Edmund Burke (right), who is often described as the father of conservatism, was rector between 1793 and 1785

Snowden defeated former champion cyclist Graeme Obree, author Alan Bissett and the Very Rev Kelvin Holdsworth, who champions gay rights.

Former CIA employee Snowden, 30, became a wanted man when his leaks brought to light secret National Security Agency (NSA) documents which revealed widespread US surveillance of phone and internet communications.

He is staying in Russia where he has been given temporary asylum.

In a statement to The Guardian, Snowden said he was 'humbled and honoured' by the vote, describing it as a bold and historic decision in support of academic freedom.

'In a world where so many of our developing thoughts and queries and plans must be entrusted to the open internet, mass surveillance is not simply a matter of privacy, but of academic freedom and human liberty,' Snowden said.

A statement from the group which nominated Snowden said: 'We are incredibly delighted to see Edward Snowden elected as the new rector of Glasgow University.

'We have a proud and virtuous tradition of making significant statements through our rectors and we have once more championed this idea by proving to the world that we are not apathetic to important issues such as democratic rights.

'Our opposition to pervasive and immoral state intrusion has gone down in the records.

'What is more, we showed Edward Snowden and other brave whistleblowers that we stand in solidarity with them, regardless of where they are.'

The statement added: 'In the following weeks we will continue to campaign for the NSA and GCHQ to cease their assault on our fundamental right to privacy and for Edward Snowden to be recognised as the courageous whistleblower he is, rather than a traitor.'

The role of rector is to represent student issues to senior management at the university, but previous incumbents have been elected as political statements.

Winnie Mandela was elected in 1987 and Israeli whistleblower Mordechai Vanunu became rector in 2005, despite students knowing that neither would be able to travel to Glasgow and take up the practical role of the position.

Sir Robert Peel (left), the former Prime Minister who helped create the modern concept of the police force, was elected as rector in 1836 and (right) newsreader Reginald Bosanquet pictured reading the News at Ten, was rector between 1980 and 1984

The English statesman Lord Palmerston was rector between 1862 and 1865. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela (right), ex-wife of former South Africa President Nelson Mandela, was elected rector between 1987 and 1990

The election was held under the single transferable vote system. Snowden received 3,124 votes in the first round and 3,347 in the second.

The nearest candidate was Mr Holdsworth, Episcopalian rector and provost of St Mary's Cathedral in Glasgow, with 1,563 votes.

PhD student Chris Cassells, part of the group that nominated Snowden, said: 'We had no idea what the outcome would be but we are absolutely delighted so many students felt this was an important enough issue to come out and vote.

'It's in the same tradition that elected Vanunu and Mandela. It's a clear statement from Glasgow students that they stand in opposition to pervasive state surveillance and that they celebrate Edward Snowden for his actions as a whistleblower.

'We are very hopeful he will be able to deliver the inaugural address in April either via video link or a pre-recorded message and hopefully that will be the first in a series of engagements.'

The nomination of Snowden proved controversial on the university campus.

The group that campaigned for his election complained that some posters they put up had been torn down and cut up, while some university unions called for an active rector who will be able to work on behalf of students to be elected.

More than 6,500 students voted – double the number who voted when former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy was elected for a second time three years ago.

A group of students who gathered in the university's Bute Hall to hear the election result were disappointed with the outcome.

Louise Wilson said: 'It sucks. I'm all for political statements, but at a time when the university and students need the biggest say with all the cuts it's just not appropriate to not have a working rector.'

Hannah McNeill said: 'I'm furious. We need an active rector, we could have given him [Snowden] an honorary degree or something.'

Former champion cyclist Obree is a former student at the university who dropped out four months into a design engineering degree.

He said: 'It was quite weird coming back after 25 years. I didn't quite fit in at the time so to be nominated as rector now was quite poignant. When I first accepted I didn't know Edward Snowden's hat was in the ring.

'The students obviously feel quite strongly about what he stood for.'
