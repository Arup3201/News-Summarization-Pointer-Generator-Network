The Super Bowl weekend episode of Saturday Night Live took on the two biggest news stories of the week in their cold open - the Super Bowl and Storm Juno.

The show opened with a talk show hosted by Seattle Seahawks stars Richard Sherman (played by Jay Pharoah) and Marshawn Lynch (played by Keenan Thompson), in which Lynch said little to nothing, repeating the phrase, ' Thank you for asking me to the first few questions asked of him.'

Talk then turned to Sunday's game and, of course, Deflategate, which the men also referred to as 'Ballgazi aka the e-ball-a crisis.'

One of the topics of discussion was Deflategate, and the New England Patriots

The show also mock Marshawn Lynch's insistence on not speaking with reporters, as he did on Friday (above)

The footballers mocked the new England Patriots for playing with a deflated ball in their AFC Championship game against the Indianapolis Colts, and held up what they considered a real ball - which was wearing a dreadlocks wig.

'Shout out to dreadlocks footballs,' said Thompson as Lynch, one of the few things he said during the segment. 

The Seahawks and there influx of new fans also got poked fun at, with a member of the team's backing band saying; 'I've been a diehard fan since the beginning ... of 2013.'

They also called Mayor Bill de Blasio a 'punk a**' for his reaction to Storm Juno 

Then talk turned to Storm Juno, and how Mayor Bill de Blasio shut down the city for what ultimately amounted to just a few inches of snow.

'De Blasio's a punk a** mayor,' said Pharoah as Sherman.

'You call that a blizzard? I've seen bigger blizzards at Dairy Queen.'

The episode was hosted by J.K. Simmons, recently nominated ofr Best Supporting Actor for his work in Whiplash, who did not appear in the opening segment.
