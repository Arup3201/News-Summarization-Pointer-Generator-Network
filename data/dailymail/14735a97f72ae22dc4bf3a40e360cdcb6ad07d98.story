This remarkable footage of a mega-pod dolphin stampede, three migrating grey whales and a newborn Humpback calf with its mother was captured off the Californian coast by drone.

Captain Dave Anderson, of Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Safari, in Dana Point, California, used a quadcopter drone to capture the incredible shots.

The footage includes thousands of common dolphins stampeding off Dana Point, California, along with the migration of three grey whales off San Clemente.

Capt Dave managed to capture the footage, which can be seen at Captain Dave's Dolphin and Whale Safari's website, after launching and catching the drone by hand while in a small inflatable boat.

He said: 'This is the most beautiful and compelling five minute video I have ever put together.

'I learned so much about these whales and dolphins from this drone footage that it feels like I have entered a new dimension.

'I have not been this excited about a new technology since we built our underwater viewing pods on our whale watching boat.'

In January, MailOnline reported how a so-called 'superpod' of dolphins was spotted swimming together off the coast of Costa Rica.

The group was thought to include anywhere between 3,000 and 5,000 of the creatures.

In the footage, the animals can be seen propelling themselves out of the water before joining scores of others swimming deep under the water's surface.

Some of the footage was taken by cameramen both in and above the water, using long-lens and slow motion techniques.

But the most amazing, detailed scenes came from cameras installed in 'spy creatures' - fake animals with cameras built into their mouths and eyes.
