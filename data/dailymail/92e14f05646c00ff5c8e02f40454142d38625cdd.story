Home-grown fanatics who go to fight with ISIS are ‘w*****s’ who watch porn because they can’t find girlfriends, Boris Johnson has claimed.

The London Mayor said British terrorists become radicalised are often ‘badly adjusted in their relations with women’ and turn to extremism to stop them feeling like losers.

He said: ‘If you look at all the psychological profiling about bombers, they typically will look at porn. They are literally w***ers.’

Mr Johnson's remarks were blasted by some Muslim groups. But the London Mayor said his claim was ‘not remotely controversial’.

Boris Johnson, attending Norbury Manor Primary School this morning,  said British terrorists become radicalised are often ‘badly adjusted in their relations with women’ and turn to extremism to stop them feeling like losers'

More than 600 people from Britain are thought to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join jihadists, with security forces warning returning fighters pose the biggest terror threat to Britain.

The Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond held a terror conference in London this month and warned there was a 'very significant risk' of an attack by extremists.

He said ISIS was ‘the greatest single immediate threat to Britain's national security'.

Mr Johnson, speaking to the Sun, said psychological profiling carried out by Britain’s spy agencies had revealed the pathetic reason so many youngsters were signing up to fight with ISIS.

He said it was time for Muslim leaders to speak up much more forcefully against Islamist terror.

The prospective Tory MP said: ‘They are not explaining how it can be that this one religion seems to be leading people astray in so many cases.

‘They are not being persuasive in the right way with these people. I am not yet hearing it in the way we need to hear it.’

He said the ISIS fanatics tearing across the Middle East were ‘barbaric’ and ‘deserve to be treated as such’.

Mr Johnson said: ‘They are tortured. They will be very badly adjusted in their relations with women, and that is a symptom of their feeling of being failures and that the world is against them.

‘They are not making it with girls, and so they turn to other forms of spiritual comfort — which of course is no comfort.’

‘I fervently think we need to demystify this lot,’ he added.

‘The people most likely to get involved in IS or be radicalised are the same as those most vulnerable to getting dragged into drug gangs or other criminal activity.

‘They are just young men in desperate need of self-esteem who do not have a particular mission in life, who feel that they are losers and this thing makes them feel strong — like winners.’

Despite the remarks, experts have warned that ISIS is using British female extremists to incite other UK women to carry out terror attacks.

Experts at King's College London say they have identified a group of around 30 British women in northern Syria, who are encouraging others to launch terrorist attacks in the UK.

Around 50 British women and girls are thought to have joined ISIS, with the majority based in the jihadist's stronghold Raqqa and aged between 16 and 24.

The London Mayor, who is running to be an MP again at the next election in the safe Tory seat of Uxbridge, also insisted he had not made a ‘deal’ with David Cameron to succeed him as Conservative leader.

The London Mayor revealed he will serve under Mr Cameron when his second mayor’s term ends in 2016.

Mr Johnson said: ‘A deal? No, no, no, there is no deal. Genuinely I would tell you.

‘I’m just going to have to disappoint you. The reason for that is because I desperately want him to win.

‘Over the years I have questionably rattled the cage and beaten the drum, and a certain amount of plaster has come off the ceiling. That is part of being mayor.

‘But we are all shooting from the same trench - I do not want Ed Miliband anywhere near government in Britain.’
