This house in Shanghai, China could possibly be the world’s thinnest building.

Located on Ningbo Road in the densely populated Chinese city, the home appears to be nothing more than a brick wall, extending down the road.

The house is part of a triangular shaped block, and at its point becomes so thin that residents cannot fit a chair in front of their windows.

Tight squeeze: This could arguably be one of the thinnest buildings in the world, located in Shanghai, China

Limited space: According to a local blogger, the residents at the end of the building can barely fit a chair in front of their windows

Some have solved this problem by extending their windows into covered balconies in order to fit their lives into their home.

Several bloggers have pointed out the building resemblance to the famous Flatiron building on New York’s Manhattan.

The
 Flatiron Building was originally called the Fuller Building but 
received its unique moniker due to its shape like a clothes iron.

Located
 on Fifth Avenue, the building has become a Manhattan landmark and a 
popular tourist spot. It's value has been estimated at $190million.
