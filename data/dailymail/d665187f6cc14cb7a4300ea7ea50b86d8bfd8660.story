A woman was jailed today for fleecing her grandmother out of her £140,000 life savings and using the cash to fund a lavish lifestyle of luxury cars, new clothes, exotic holidays and £10,000 on a single spa trip.

Katie Gosley-Shaw, 38, stripped Ruth Gosley, 89, of money left to her by her late husband, leaving her unable to afford heating or new clothes. 

Mother-of-two Gosley-Shaw, from Tockwith, York, was jailed for four years after she was found guilty of five counts of theft and two of fraud committed between 2009 and 2012 after a trial last year.

Gosley-Shaw, who carried out four years of deceit and theft - while at the same time claiming state benefits - had purchased a flashy BMW, foreign holidays, hotel stays, new dresses and run several credit cards.

Leeds Crown Court heard today that Gosley-Shaw, who used to work for a hair products company, spent up to £200 a month on petrol and planned to buy a £540,000 house with her partner without needing a mortgage. 

It was also revealed that Gosley-Shaw spent nearly £10,000 on a single transaction at Feversham Arms health spa in Helmsley, North Yorkshire, and that she also stole two gold necklaces from her grandmother.

Before it was stolen by her granddaughter, Mrs Gosley had worn one of the necklaces, which had been a Christmas present  from her late husband, every day for 15 years.

Prosecutor Liam O'Brien told the court that Mrs Gosley was left devastated by the actions of her granddaughter. 

He said: 'Mrs Gosley said that she had "broken her heart". 

'She said she couldn't bear the thought of the defendant being sent to prison because of the children.' 

According to Mr O'Brien, Mrs Gosley's late husband had reassured her she would be cared for after his death.

He said: 'He told me "Don't cry Tosh, you will be all right" and I was all right because he left me quite a lot of money, but it's vanished. The lot.' 

During her trial, the granddaughter claimed in the witness box that her grandma had approved each and every transaction, including giving her about £65,000 in a single 'gift' by selling shares.

According to Gosley-Shaw, Mrs Gosley also lent her money because she had financial problems following the break-up of her marriage and lived beyond her means. 

Gosley-Shaw said: 'She is a very, very kind and generous woman.' 

The grandmother  denied approving any of the transactions. 

'Mrs Gosley previously said: 'Katie was here all the time. She would nip in with the kids and we would have a natter. She was here almost daily.

'She was so helpful. She would do anything for me, go to the shops, anything. I adored Katie. 

'She was always full of life and liked a good chat. We were good pals.

'If I was down in the dumps she was the one who brought me up. She was very good. 

'What happened was a terrible shock. It's unbelievable how it happened. 

'If she'd have wanted anything all she had to do was ask and she could have had it.'

During sentencing, Judge Rodney Jameson QC told Gosley-Shaw: 'You stole from your grandmother who by the end of matters was in her late eighties.

'She thought that you were the epitome of modern, glamorous living. 

'She was speaking highly of you. In many respects finding it difficult to reconcile with the person she had known until then to the person you had been over the past four years.'

Judge Jameson added: 'You did not need to do what you did. This was not in my judgement a case where necessary or significant pressure played any part in this offence. 

'In contrast, the theft left your grandmother virtually penniless, living on a state pension. 

'It is about as mean as an offence as is possible to imagine.'
