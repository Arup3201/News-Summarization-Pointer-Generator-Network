A greyhound which may be the 'fastest in the world' after it smashed a Sydney track record to win its first race start has been retired to stud because he can earn more money off the track.

Shakey Jakey, still a year off his maximum potential racing speed, took an amazing 22-length lead to win Race 6 at Wentworth Park on April 6.

Afterwards, an Australian syndicate offered owner David Pringle $700,000. Then he knocked back $1m - which may have been from Chinese investors - after consulting with his family and deciding to retire Shakey Jakey to stud.

Meanwhile, Mr Pringle lives in a humble fibro house while the prized greyhound and his mother live in a comfortable brick kennel.

'It was a thrill because he scored the most prestigious win in the country on one of the hardest tracks in the world and he didn't beat the record, he smashed it,' Pringle, a third generation greyhound trainer, told the MailOnline.

Second generation champion: Shakey Jakey was sired by Collision out of champion Kiacatu Pearl, who owner Graham Pringle produced by spending the Federal Government $1800 baby bonus for his first child, Bailey, on stud fees

'But you gotta keep going mate. You can't just sit around hoping that every day you can feed your family.

'He just might earn more at stud, so it's worth taking the risk. If you didn't take risks you wouldn't be in the game and that's in my blood.'

Shakey Jakey has champion bloodlines which go back four generations to a dog called Worth Doing, which belonged to Pringle's father.

Pringle, 32, lives in an old fibro house at Clergate, near Orange in Central Western NSW with his wife, Danielle, and three young children, Bailey, Harry and Bonny. His 20 dogs live in a heated, double brick kennel on the property.

When their elder son Bailey was born, the Pringles received an $1800 Federal Government baby bonus, which they used to buy semen through a stud service to produce a female dog, Kiacatu Pearl, Shakey Jakey's mother.

Kiacatu Pearl won several races at Wentworth Park before being mated with another fast greyhound, Collision. Shakey Jakey was one of their litter of 11.

'As he got older, he got faster and faster,' Pringle said. 'He had his performance trial at Bathurst in March and he broke the trial record there.

'Wentworth Park is a hard track because of its configuration and sharp corners. The Australian track record over 515m is 29:30. Wentworth is 520m and he did 29:07.'

Shakey Jakey's maiden performance, which had race callers repeating the result in wonder, made world headlines in greyhound news.

'Some of the fastest dogs in the world come from Australia and every other country wants Australian dogs, particularly the Chinese,' Pringle said.

'The Chinese, they love it. They are massive punters of greyhounds and run dogs two out on private tracks over there, but keeping the family bloodline going here is sentimental to me.'

Pringle visits Shakey Jakey at the Rocky Ridge Stud on the NSW Central Coast, where the black dog is allowed to service 216 bitches a year, each with an 'introductory' fee of $1650. The figure may double within 12 months, earning him more than $700,000 annually.

If the dog had continued to race, Pringle estimates he might have broken ten track records and scored 20 wins out of as many starts.

'But you've got to think of the future,' he said, 'I've now got to find another dog and do the same thing.'
