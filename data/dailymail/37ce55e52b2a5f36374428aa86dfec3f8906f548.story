A pediatric nurse accused of molesting a six-week-old boy who was born prematurely allegedly sent indecent photos of the baby to a counselor.

Michael William Lutts, who is also a foster parent, brought the infant to his home on August 4 and texted Stephen Schaffner, saying 'Hey I have a baby for us', court documents show.

Lutts, a nurse at Kaiser Permanente care group, sent several images and videos of a sexual messages to Schaffner, a counselor from Greensboro, Maryland.

Schaffner, who was charged yesterday with conspiracy and nine counts of sexual exploitation of a child, replied with messages including, 'That's hot' and 'nice pic'.

Lutts sent the images and messages to Schaffner, 34, immediately after being granted care of the baby and the two made plans for the nurse to abuse the child, according to federal prosecutors.

Lutts, 50, was arrested in August and is charged with sexual molestation.

Court documents read: 'It was the object of the scheme to employ and use [the infant] to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions of such conduct.'

Schaffner was a licensed clinical counselor in Maryland until his permit was suspended in June, prosecutors said. He had previously worked as a counselor in Arizona, Fox 5 reported.

He will face between 15 and 30 years in prison for each count, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

Prosecutors said arrests were made following an investigation of an email address of someone who was allegedly distributing child pornography. Lutts was identified as a recipient.

FBI agents later searched Lutts’ home and found a cell phone that allegedly included the text messages, photographs and videos.
