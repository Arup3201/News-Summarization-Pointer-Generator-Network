The defense attorney for a man charged with raping and strangling to death a University of New Hampshire student spent his first day cross-examining the state's star witness trying to convince jurors she was possessed by imaginary characters she had created.

Defense attorney Joachim Barth also asserted the witness, 20-year-old Kathryn McDonough, changed her story and shifted the blame from herself to defendant Seth Mazzaglia, her ex-boyfriend, just to get a reduced sentence.

Mazzaglia is charged with first-degree murder in the October 2012 strangulation death of 19-year-old Elizabeth ‘Lizzi’ Marriott, of Westborough, Massachusetts. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors say he and McDonough dumped Marriott's body in a river and it hasn't been recovered.

Doesn't hear voices: Kathryn McDonough, 20, testified for a third day Thursday in the trial of Seth Mazzaglia, her 31-year-old ex-boyfriend who in 2012 prosecutors say strangled to death and raped a 19-year-old college student and co-worker of McDonough's who refused to have sex with Mazzaglia

Cross-examination: McDonough was grilled by the defense attorney for Mazzaglia over her recorded confessions that she has various personas in her own head who can take over and cause her to black out at times

McDonough, 20, testified Thursday the imaginary characters she began creating during childhood were to help her get through difficult situations after an horrific retelling of events the day before of the shocking circumstances that led to Marriott’s death.

After being rebuffed twice by the 19-year-old University of New Hampshire student, Mazzaglia crept up behind her as she watched a movie with McDonough and quickly incapacitated her with a rope before raping her, McDonough told the court.

Afterwards he ordered her to hold the white rope - which he and McDonough had used in their sex games - around the already-motionless girl's neck, she said, and she did as she was told.

Barth opened his cross-examination reminding McDonough that she gave a statement to him and his investigators two days after Mazzaglia's arrest and told them Marriott died while McDonough was having sex with her with a restraint that kept Marriott from raising her head.

McDonough told the defense team that Marriott had a seizure and died. McDonough agreed that was what she said at the time.

'I was trying to make it sound believable...I knew what happened to Lizzi': Defense attorney Joachim Barth exhaustively went over conversations involving McDonough and her friends, one of whom she told she was under the influence of one of her 'personas' during the murder and could not remember it

Barth emphasized that she changed her story only after she was given an immunity deal ‘to reduce your years in prison.’ McDonough agreed with the timing.

Barth spent several hours going over Facebook pages dating to 2011 and other conversations with Mazzaglia, 31, and others in which she talked of other characters or personas she had created. She testified repeatedly Thursday that they were ‘masks’ she would use when she wanted to be stronger.

During questioning peppered by objections by prosecutors, Barth referenced conversation after conversation in which McDonough had talked about the personas, including a strong one dubbed Scarlet.

Barth told jurors during his opening statement May 28 that McDonough had ‘a real problem. She had five voices in her head.’ And he told them McDonough was secretly recorded telling a friend that the night Marriott died one of the personas took control and McDonough blacked out.

On cross-examination, McDonough disputed that her reference was to the night Marriott died. She said that she told Roberta Gerkin that the persona was taking over during that conversation and blocking her memory.

‘I was telling her Anay, or Charlotte, was blocking my memory of that night so I wouldn't have to tell her about it,’ McDonough said. 'I was trying to make it sound believable...I knew what happened to Lizzi that night. I was aware, but I did not want to tell Roberta.'

She denied that Charlotte, who Mazzaglia referred to as Annay, interfered with her thinking or caused her to black out.

‘She's just a character I came up with, not someone who can take over my mind or control me,’ McDonough said.

Barth said she repeatedly referred to her characters in texts and Facebook conversations with Mazzaglia and battled her assertions that she didn't take them seriously. She said she invoked them because Mazzaglia took his own personas very seriously.

‘I was just a 17-year-old kid,’ she testified Thursday. ‘I had just met his person. When I mentioned it (a persona) he took it very seriously.’

McDonough testified Wednesday she lured Marriott, her co-worker, to the apartment with the promise of watching a movie or playing a video game. In reality, she testified, she was offering Marriott as a sex partner for Mazzaglia, who was angry that McDonough had left him alone for 12 days.

But McDonough said Marriott twice refused sexual suggestions by Mazzaglia.

‘That's when he moved up behind her and he pulled the rope up over her head and he strangled her,’ she said.

She said Mazzaglia raped Marriott while calling her names as her motionless body lay on the floor.

On
 Tuesday, McDonough testified how she had lured Marriott, her co-worker,
 to the apartment with the promise of watching a movie or playing a 
video game.

In reality, McDonough testified, she 
was offering Marriott as a sex partner for Mazzaglia, who was angry that
 McDonough had left him alone for 12 days.

Mazzaglia sent her a text message at 10:26 p.m. asking, 'We painting tonight?' - a coded reference to having sex with Marriott.

She replied: 'Your decision, I guess. If you have a plan. Nervous.'

'I didn't really know what he wanted to do,' McDonough testified.

After a game of strip poker, Mazzaglia suggested to Marriott that she kiss McDonough.

When
 Marriott said no, saying she was in a committed relationship, he said 
he wanted the college student to watch McDonough and Mazzaglia have sex.
 Marriott again refused.

McDonough,
 who previously told the jury about the couple's sadomasochistic 
relationship, testified that Mazzaglia was unaccustomed to hearing 'no'.

'That's
 when he moved up behind her and he pulled the rope up over her head and
 he strangled her,' she said. 'She let out a quick noise and she sort of
 stopped. Her arms curled up against her chest and her eyes were 
closed.'

McDonough said he 
had brutally sodomized her a month earlier as 'punishment' for failing 
to find him a sex 'slave' so she was willing to 'try and please him' 
however she could.

'I 
think it would be fitting if the first thing you saw me do when you got 
back is pleasure one of your friends until they died of orgasms and only
 then turned my brutal attention to you,' Mazzaglia allegedly wrote in a
 text message he sent to McDonough.

She added that Mazzaglia wanted her to recruit Marriott as the slave because of her physique and personality, SeaCoastOnline reported.

McDonough, 20, is the key witness against her ex and lawyers on both sides cast her differently.

Prosecutors portray her as the sexual submissive, dominated in all aspects of their relationship by a man 10 years older than her, but Mazzaglia's lawyers say she was the dominatrix, a woman obsessed with finding another woman to dominate, and it was Mazzaglia who was her sexual slave.

Marriott had transferred to the University of New Hampshire only weeks earlier to major in marine biology. She was a commuter student, living with her aunt and uncle in Chester during the week and returning home to Westborough most weekends.

Marriott had been in a committed relationship with Brittany Atwood, who lived in Massachusetts.

On the night she died, Marriot text messaged Atwood minutes before 9pm to let her know she was going over to 'Kat's' to watch a movie. Atwood testified she was happy for her because she was finally making new friends.

The text message was Marriott's last communication.
