An American tycoon who branded French workers lazy has now accused a government minister of being ‘an imbecile’.

Maurice Taylor took his war of words with the French government into a third day with a second stinging letter to the country’s industry minister.

In it, he told Arnaud Montebourg that his country has ‘beautiful women and fantastic wine’ but ‘no idea how to run a business’. And he branded the minister ‘an imbecile who is disconnected from reality’.

Row: Maurice Taylor (left) sent a letter to Arnaud Montebourg (right) branding the French workforce as lazy but the industry minister has hit back today saying Mr Maurice has displayed 'perfect ignorance'

His latest attack came two days after he called French workers ‘lazy and overpaid’ and said they ‘talk too much’.

The initial outburst came after he 
had been approached by the French government to take over an Amiens tyre
factory to save 1,200 jobs.

He refused to do so and told Mr 
Montebourg he could ‘keep his so-called workers’, who ‘get one hour for 
breaks and lunch, talk for three and work for three’.

It prompted an angry riposte from the
French government, with Mr Montebourg accusing the head of Titan 
International of ‘perfect ignorance’.

Mr Montebourg went on to say America 
is the top foreign investor in France, with 4,200 US companies employing
nearly half a million people within the country.

There was also a veiled threat, as he
said the French government would look into Mr Taylor’s company’s 
finances with ‘redoubled zeal’.

Now Mr Taylor has written to Mr 
Montebourg again, saying: ‘Your letter shows the extent to which your 
political class is disconnected from the real world.

‘You call me an extremist, but most 
businessmen would agree that I would be mad to spend millions buying up a
French tyre factory only to pay some of the highest salaries in the 
world.

Blunt: The Titan International boss was scathing in his assessment of the work ethic of staff at the Goodyear factory in Amiens

‘Your letter did not mention why the 
French government has not stepped in to rescue this Goodyear tyre 
factory. The extremists are in your government, who have no idea how to 
build a business.

'I never said I would lower French 
salaries. I only said that if I am paying people to do seven hours work,
I expect them to do at least six hours.’

But he added: ‘France does have 
beautiful women and great wine. Also my grandmother named my father 
after French entertainer Maurice Chevalier, and I inherited the name.’

Mr Taylor then let rip again on 
France’s Europe 1 radio yesterday morning, telling the presenter: ‘Is 
Montebourg stupid, or what?

‘You want to talk about the Goodyear factory, so why are you talking  to me? You should be talking to  that imbecile.’

'The French way': Mr Taylor wrote to the French 
industry minister Arnaud Montebourg (left) saying that French workers 
are 'lazy'. He said he visited the factory in Amiens (right) several 
times where the 'workforce gets paid high wages but works only three 
hours'

Mr Taylor’s tirades have sparked 
outrage in France’s socialist media, but they prompted Right-wing daily 
paper Le Monde to suggest: ‘Perhaps he’s right?’

The row comes as France teeters on 
the brink of recession and unemployment has hit three million – the 
highest level of joblessness in 15 years.

A report by Swiss bank UBS found the 
French graft for just 1,480 hours a year, with 27 days annual holiday – 
meaning they have more free time than any other nation on the planet.

Britons work 1,782 hours a year – 301 
more than the French – and have 20 days’ holiday a year, making us the 
world’s 36th most lazy nation, it was found.
