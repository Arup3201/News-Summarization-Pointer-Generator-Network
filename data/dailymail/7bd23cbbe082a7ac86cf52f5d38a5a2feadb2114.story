She's one of showbiz's most famous redheads so it's hardly surprising that actress Christina Hendricks has been snapped up to front a new hair colour campaign.

The Mad Men star, 39, has been unveiled as the  glossy raven tresses of Nice 'N Easy's new beauty campaign and shared her top tips for red carpet glamour.

Naturally a dark blonde, as a young girl Christina was first inspired to colour her hair red by the fictional heroine of LM Montgomery’s books, Anne Of Green Gables - another of the world’s most iconic red heads.

Finally making the leap early in her career, Christina coloured her hair for an Italian magazine shoot and it’s been her colour of choice ever since; through the beginnings of her acting and modelling career, to all seven seasons of Mad Men. 

The star, who was once hailed the sexiest woman in the world by Esquire magazine, revealed that her red hair has influenced her style.

She said: 'I think being a red head has encouraged me to be a bit more playful with my fashion, maybe be little bit more quirky and eccentric even, so when I go out in the evening I like to play with colour and jewellery and it sort of complements being a red head.'

The actress also opened up her make-up bag and revealed the secrets behind her flawless porcelain complexion.

Discussing how she combats dehydrated skin when travelling a lot with work, she said: 'On a plane, I usually try to bring an eye cream and a lip balm with me. 

'I don’t like to put too much on when I travel, but I like to keep hydrated around my eyes. When I get tired or if my skin feels dry, I find that it shows up mostly around my eyes. I’m also just constantly slathering lip balm on as well.'

Forget dazzling showbiz events by night, Christina says she's 'definitely someone who sits in front of the fireplace' because she thinks it’s 'so romantic' and she 'loves it'. 

'I’ve noticed that I’ve started keeping a little group of moisturisers, lip balm and cuticle oil next to where I sit on the couch, so I can file my nails and do some pampering while I watch a movie. I like to keep a little side table of beauty products.' 

It seems that starring in Mad Men has influenced her sense of style. She added: 'I love fashion and I love beauty and so, to me, it’s about exploration and trying new things.

'I love head pieces and I love hats, I love curls and I love sleek. I love playing around with all those different things.'

Mad Men will soon come to an end after seven seasons, but Christina  has already started to move on from the period drama.

The  actress behind Joan Harris (nee Holloway) has been cast on Cameron Crowe's upcoming comedy, Roadies.

Cable network Showtime made the casting announcement in December.

Hendricks will play Shelli, the tough-but-emotional production manager of a touring rock band and her character is described as being 'married to her job.'

Hendricks' co-stars in the one-hour comedy include Luke Wilson, as a newly sober tour manager, and Imogen Poots as an electrical technician.

A busy actress for several years before Mad Men, Hendricks appeared in recurring roles for shows like ER, Firefly, and Life.

But it was her casting as head secretary Joan Holloway on Mad Men that brought Hendricks wider fame.

The 39-year-old, who was once hailed the sexiest woman in the world by Esquire magazine, revealed that her red hair has helped her experiment with fashion

Her character dealt with the business world of the 1960s, facing everything from casual sexism and rape to single motherhood.

For her work, Hendricks received five Emmy nominations for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama.

Fans will not have to wait for the premiere of Roadies to see Hendricks again, since the final episodes of Mad Men will air during 2015.

Hendricks will also co-star with Chloe Grace Moretz, Nicholas Hoult, and Charlize Theron in the 2015 film, Dark Places. 

Betty Draper (January Jones), Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) and Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) made names for themselves in Mad Men
