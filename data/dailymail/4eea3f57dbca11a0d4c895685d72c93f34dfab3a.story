The Dallas Cowboys released defensive end Michael Sam from the practice squad Tuesday, another setback as the NFL's first ever openly gay player tries to make an active roster during the regular season for the first time.

Sam spent seven weeks with the Cowboys after signing to their practice squad on Sept. 3, four days after he was among the final cuts by the St. Louis Rams at the end of the preseason.

'I will take the lessons I learned here in Dallas and continue to fight for an an opportunity to prove that I can play every Sunday,' the 24-year-old tweeted Tuesday afternoon after a gracious acknowledgement of the news.

Another heartbreak: Michael Sam, the first openly gay player drafted into the NFL, was cut from the Dallas Cowboys practice squad on Tuesday

He tweeted:  

'I want to thank the Jones family and the entire Cowboys organization for this opportunity, as well as my friends, family, teammates, and fans for their support.'

The Rams drafted the former SEC defensive player of the year from Missouri late in the seventh round in May. He was pick No. 249 out of 256. Sam had three sacks in the preseason with St. Louis playing mostly against second- and third-stringers.

The Cowboys are among the league's worst in sacks but have been getting solid production with a rotation in the front four of a defense exceeding expectations.

Dallas also has rookie second-round pick DeMarcus Lawrence close to coming back after breaking his right foot in training camp. He was placed on short-term injured reserve and will be eligible to play next week against Arizona.

Veteran defensive end Anthony Spencer has been getting stronger each week in his return from microfracture knee surgery that sidelined him all but one game last season.

The Cowboys (6-1), off to their best start since they were 12-1 in 2007, are playing their second straight NFC East opponent at home, with Washington (2-5) visiting Monday night.

While releasing Sam, the Cowboys added linebacker Troy Davis of Central Florida and defensive tackle Ken Bishop of Northern Illinois to their practice squad.
