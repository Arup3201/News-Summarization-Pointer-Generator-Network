The Transport Security Administration has been criticized for humiliating a cancer survivor at a security checkpoint for wearing an incontinence pad.

The man's wife has told that he suffers from OAB (overactive bladder) after a battle with prostate cancer and wears adult diapers for his condition.

At an airport security checkpoint recently, he was forced to explain his situation multiple times to TSA officers, one of whom announced that he was wearing a diaper for the whole security line to hear, and then underwent an embarrassing back-room search.

Public humilation: A woman has told the story of her husband's embarrassment at an airport TSA checkpoint

The man's wife, writing anonymously, described her husband's ordeal on the forum CafeMom.

She writes that her husband, after waiting for a lengthy time in the security line at an unnamed airport, had had a 'bladder spasm' and had wet the incontinence pad.

When he went through security, he was asked if he was carrying any liquids in his clothing.

He explained his condition to the female TSA officer, who called over her male boss and tried to explain the situation to him.

'The problem was he did not understand what an "incontinence product" was when she told him,' writes the man's wife.

'Myself, [my husband], and the female TSA employee tried explaining a few times before the woman finally just shouted "HE IS WEARING A DIAPER" which caused pretty much everyone to turn and stare at us.'

Then, she adds, the TSA officer 'snickered.'

To add to the couple's humiliation, the TSA agents told them their scanner was unable to detect what was beneath the man's clothing and forced him to take off the diaper so that they could inspect the 'suspicious padding,' writes the man's wife.

The officers needed to conduct a 'further review' of the man's diaper, and took him into a room with four TSA agents who subjected him to another pat-down before making him change into a fresh adult diaper and hand over the soiled one.

The couple were finally cleared to leave, but the frustration and humiliation the ordeal caused made the woman's husband cry, a very uncommon occurrence, she says.

'Frustrating that people have to go through this in the name of security. We have neither security nor freedom now, just lots of embarrassing and frustrating stories,' she wrote.
