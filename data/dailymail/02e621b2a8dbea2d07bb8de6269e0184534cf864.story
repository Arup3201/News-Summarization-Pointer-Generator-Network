Midas touch: The U.s. Marshalls have a warrant for the arrest of Tommy G. Thompson, who is accused of failing to pay his investors and crewmen linked to the discovery of the 'Ship of Gold'

The ocean engineer credited with finding the mythic ‘Ship of Gold’ laden with treasure back in 1988 is now being sought by U.S. Marshalls for allegedly refusing to pay his crew and investors.

The SS Central America sank during a hurricane off the North Carolina coast in 1857, taking 425 souls and up to 21 tons of gold to the ocean floor.

The bullion had been shipped from San Francisco to the west coast of Panama, then sent by rail to the Central American nation's east coast and finally loaded onto the 280-foot steamship bound for New York.

In 1983, Tommy G. Thompson, of Columbus, Ohio, organized an expedition to find the epic ship and recover the treasure, promising his investors major returns if his mission is a success.

Five years later, on September 11, 1988, Thompson announced to much fanfare that his team, the Columbus-America Discovery Group, had found the shipwreck, but the big payday never came.

Although books have been written about the search for the SS Central America, it remains unclear to this day how much gold was recovered from the underwater site, Fox News reported.

It has been reported, however, that Thompson sold bars and coins to a California mint for $52million, but his investors, including a Columbus newspaper tycoon and a prominent auto dealer, say they have not seen a dime of it. 

Thompson’s crew made up of nine technicians who helped locate the ‘Ship of Gold’ and recover the treasure from the ocean floor 8,000 feet deep have been locked in a drawn-out legal battle to get more than $2million that they say their former boss still owes them.

‘There is very little reason to doubt
that these plaintiffs will prevail and in an amount in excess of $2 
million,’ Michael Szolosi, an attorney for the technicians, told 
FoxNews.com. ‘And all they see from the defendants is delay, delay, 
delay.’

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Edmund Sargus issued a warrant for 60-year-old Thompson, but so far, efforts by U.S. Marshalls to find him have proven fruitless.

They have no current photo of him, and it seems that no one has laid an eye on him in years. One of Thompson’s attorneys said that his client is ‘at sea.’

Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Drew Shadwick told FoxNews.com that investigators are pursuing a ‘number of leads’ and hope to have Thompson in custody soon.

Judge Sargus temporarily blocked the 
sale or transfer of 500 restrike gold coins made from some of the gold 
discovered in the shipwreck. Those coins were included in part of a deal
in 2000 to sell rights to the remaining treasure to the California Gold
Marketing Group for $52million, leaving about $30million after the cost
of recovery efforts.

Sargus also ordered Thompson to disclose the location of those coins, as well as funds from a trust.

‘We
have reason to believe that the 500 coins still exist somewhere and 
that’s why it’s so important for [Thompson] to come to court as he’s 
been ordered and to answer what the plaintiffs and the judge want 
answered,’ the attorney for Thompson’s crewmen said.

Court battles: Thompson's nine crew members sued the salvager, claiming that he failed to pay them more than $2million

According to Thompson’s own attorneys, the reclusive treasure hunter is not aware that there is a warrant out for his arrest.

 ‘It’s my understanding when he does 
come back from sea he has every intention of complying with that court’s
order,’ attorney Avonte Campinha-Bacote said. ‘Obviously, he will 
return.’

Thompson has been 
mired in legal battles with a host of insurance companies, rival 
treasure hunters and a group of 161 investors who put up $12.7million to
finance the expedition.

In
1998, after years of litigation, Thompson and his companies were 
rewarded 92 per cent of the recovered gold, with the rest going to 
insurance companies that paid claims after the steamship sank, according
to the Columbus Dispatch.

Eight
years later, the team of nine technicians filed a federal lawsuit to 
seek the millions they claim is due to them for finding the most famous 
shipwreck of its time.

The
gold ship, a 278ft-long sidewheel steamer, had 578 passengers and crew 
on board when she left the Panamanian port of Colon on September 3 1857,
bound for New York under the command of William Lewis Herndon.

After
a stop in Havana, she continued north up the U.S. east coast until, on 
September 9, she was caught in a Category 2 hurricane off the coast of 
the Carolinas.

After two 
days rocked by the fierce tempest, the Central America's sails were 
shredded, she was taking on water, and her boiler was on the verge of 
being extinguished.

Her fate
was sealed when one of the seals to the paddle wheels sprang a leak 
and, by noon that day, her engineers could keep the boiler's fire 
burning no longer.

The resulting fall in steam pressure 
shut down both the pumps that were keeping water at bay and the paddle 
wheels that had kept her bow to the wind.

In
an attempt to draw attention to their plight, passengers and crew flew 
the ship's flag upside down, a universal sign of distress, to try to 
signal a passing ship. None came.

A bucket brigade was formed and her passengers and crew spent the night fighting a losing battle against the rising water.

As the ship passed the eye of the storm, engineers made vain attempts to relight the boiler.

The second half of the storm then 
struck. Without power the Central America was carried along with the 
hurricane, unable to escape the powerful winds.

The
next morning two ships were spotted and 153 passengers, mainly women 
and children, managed to make their way over in lifeboats.

However
the intense winds and heavy seas pulled the Central America and the 
rest of her company away from any hope of rescue. By 8pm that night, the
ship sank with them - and her precious cargo - still aboard.

Earlier this month, a gold bar recovered from the steamship was put on the auction block with an 
estimate set at 211 times it's original value.

Stamped on the 40-ounce Ingot is the bar’s original value of $743.70 along with ‘Kellog and Humbert’. The reverse is a plain casting save for the serial number 648 repeated at the top.

The SS Central America was recovered by Ohio-based treasure hunters Columbus America Discovery Group using a remote-controlled submarine in 1987.The group, led by Tommy Thompson, located the wreck using Bayesian search theory, where a number of factors are taken into account direct the search for lost objects.Significant amounts of gold and other artifacts were then recovered and brought to the surface using another remote-controlled sub built specifically for the recovery.After the Mr Thompson announced the find, 39 insurance companies filed a suit claiming they had a right to the gold, on the grounds that they had paid out the damages for its loss in the 19th Century.The team that found it argued in court that the gold had been abandoned and, after a legal battle, they were awarded 92 per cent of the treasure trove in 1996.The total value of the recovered gold was estimated at $150million. One recovered ingot weighing 80lb sold for a record $8million and was recognized as the most valuable piece of currency in the world at that time.
