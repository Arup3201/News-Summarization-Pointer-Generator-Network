Andy Murray will concentrate solely on the singles for Great Britain during this weekend's Davis Cup tie against the USA, after it was confirmed that he will not feature in the doubles.

The Lawn Tennis Association have revealed that the British No 1's brother Jamie and Dom Inglot would represent Britain on Saturday afternoon against the Bryan twins.

Murray had earlier revealed he was unlikely to feature on the middle day in order to conserve energy for his clash with John Isner on Sunday.

Great Britain could wrap up their Davis Cup first round tie with victory in the doubles on Saturday.

If Jamie Murray and Inglot can beat Bob and Mike Bryan then Leon Smith's side will have an unassailable 3-0 lead.

This feat could be achieved following a fantastic set of results on Friday, where both Andy Murray and James Ward secured successes over Donald Young and Isner in their singles ties.

James Ward secured a thriller five-set win over John Isner to give Great Britain a 2-0 lead in the tie overall
