It looks like Rio Ferdinand wasn’t a fan of the X Factor this year as he tweeted in support of internet sensation Wealdstone Raider’s bid for Christmas No 1.

The QPR defender posted a link to the video for the single, for which proceeds go to charity, and added: ‘You’ve got fans!! This guy cracks me up, Proper geezer!!’

Gordon Hill shot to fame on YouTube when he was filmed confronting a rival supporter at a semi-professional match featuring Wealdstone F.C. Phrases such as ‘You’ve got no fans’ and ‘You want some, I’ll give it ya’ have quickly spread across the nation.

The ex-England man is directly mentioned in the song as Hill ridicules the likes of Joey Barton, Piers Morgan and Gemma Collins before singing: ‘Rio Ferdinand, I like you, you’ve got fans’.

Ferdinand clearly appreciated the compliment and his tweet will only help raise the profile of the song which reached third place on the UK iTunes chart last night. 

The Wealdstone Raider had previously uploaded a video warning Simon Cowell that he is coming to knock X Factor-winner Ben Haenow off the top spot.

Hill said he likes Ferdinand as he has fans, unlike others he ridiculed on the video including Joey Barton

The builder-by-day might even have more fans than Ferdinand at the moment as the centre-back has found himself benched by QPR boss Harry Redknapp since returning from a ban which stemmed from his Twitter activities.

But the ex-England centre-back hasn’t stopped his social media activity and it appears Hill can count Ferdinand amongst the thousands who ‘wants some’ of the Raider on their Christmas playlists.
