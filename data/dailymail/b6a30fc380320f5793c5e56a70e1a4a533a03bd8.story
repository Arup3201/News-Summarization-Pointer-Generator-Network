A top chef has claimed women find it harder to survive in Britain’s ‘warzone’ kitchens because they are testosterone-fuelled and violent.

Tom Kerridge, who owns Britain’s only pub with two Michelin stars, questioned whether it was ‘the industry for them’ because of the ‘threatening’ atmosphere in many kitchens.

He added that chefs traditionally needed ‘fire in their belly’ to get the work done, but this may be the reason why fewer women were in the job.

However, the television star also said he wanted more women to enter the profession, because it would stop their male colleagues talking about ‘boobs’.

Kerridge, 41, who has appeared on the Great British Menu, MasterChef and Saturday Kitchen, was speaking during an appearance at the Cheltenham Literary Festival.

He also promoted chuckles from the audience when he spoke about his worst bugbear – people needlessly investing in lots of kitchen equipment.

He said people needed to stop being preoccupied with ‘fashionable’ gadgets like centrifuges and just rely on the simple oven and hob.

But his controversial comments on women raised some eyebrows in the audience and are likely to provoke the wrath of gender equality campaigners.

He said of the traditional kitchen: ‘It’s a machine and it’s a monster and it’s full-on. This doesn’t just apply to girls, we have loads of blokes do a runner.

‘The pressure and intensity of cooking for that amount of people is so intense, it’s so full-on. It’s overwhelming. It’s like a warzone almost.

‘I like girls in kitchens a lot because it does bring that testosterone level down a little bit, it does make it not so aggressive.

‘But then at the same point a lot of that fire in the chef’s belly you need, because you need them to force themselves to be ready for dinner service.

‘That’s probably why there’s not so many female chefs.

‘They are out there. It’s just whether it’s the industry for them I’m not sure, at that level.’

However, he did praise one female chef, Lisa Allen, who he said did a ‘phenomenal job’ running the kitchen at Northcote Manor in Lancashire.

And when challenged on his view, he added that he would prefer to have more women enter the profession to change its culture.

He said that while chefs needed ‘that dynamic of getting things done, that ability to dig deep and be put under pressure,’ some took it too far.

He added: ‘To go to the extreme where some kitchens go to, where it’s very uncomfortable and where it is perhaps violent, where it is perhaps feeling threatening, that is taken away a lot by having girls in the kitchen.

‘We try to make it an environment where people feel happy at work, that’s the most important thing.

‘And girls in the kitchen make blokes feel happy at work. It’s a nicer environment.’

He added: ‘It’s a different level of conversation. If there’s 16 blokes in a kitchen all talking about boobs and football – we need girls in kitchens so that we just talk about football.’

Kerridge said that his own kitchen, at gastropub The Hand & Flowers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the atmosphere was for the most part friendly.

He had been running the business with his wife Beth, a sculptor, since 2005 – and the waiting list to book a table is often a year long.

But for those who cannot wait to sample some of his cooking, his most important tip for making his dishes at home was to ditch all unnecessary equipment.

He said it was his bugbear that people invested in expensive gadgets when a basic oven was enough.

‘There’s new methodology and there’s new ideas and there’s new technique but there’s no new sea bass,’ he said.

‘So many chefs get confused with fashion and idea and are all about technique and showcasing and foraged ingredients and things being put through centrifuges.

‘Just cook it in a pan and serve it with a bit of butter. Get an amazing ingredient and treat it beautifully.’

He added: ‘I have been married to my wife for 14 years and we have never had a microwave in our house.

‘What do you need a microwave for when you’ve got an oven? That’s all you need. You need an oven and a blow torch.

‘And give yourself time.'
