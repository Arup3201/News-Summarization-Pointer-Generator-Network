Hundreds of passengers were today forced to evacuate a train and walk along the railway tracks after a commuter service caught fire during rush hour.

After the blaze broke out near Hither Green station in South-East London, commuters evacuated the train and climbed down onto the tracks.

The line had to have its power switched off to avoid electrocuting the 400 passengers as they walked to safety at the station.

Helping hand: commuters leave the train

The company operating the train blamed the fire on a piece of machinery which overheated after drawing too much electricity from the tracks.

Thick black smoke started billowing out of the Southeastern train around 8am, prompting passengers to pull the alarm and open carriage doors using the emergency button.

Commuters started pouring on the tracks, and banged on the sides of other carriage to warn their fellow passengers they should evacuate.

The incident led to severe delays on the line from Dartford in to Charing Cross, but no one was seriously injured despite the panic.

Several passengers took to Twitter in
the aftermath of the fire - Danielle Hammond wrote: 'My train being on 
fire & being ditched onto the tracks is doing nothing to convince me
I shouldn't have stayed in bed today!

'Had so much smoke in our carriage. Scary stuff!'

Emily
Bastone-Wright tweeted: 'Wonder if @se-railway will tell us why my 
train carriage decided to explode and cause panic through other 
carriages today at Hither Green???'

Commuter Jonathan Lewis told the Evening Standard: 'It started looking like it was foggy outside, then there was the sound of all the windows shutting in the carriage in front of ours.

'Then passengers poured into our carriage to escape the smoke. The announcement was, "We hope to be moving shortly", but by this point the doors were already open and people were helping each other down on to the track.'

A spokesman for operator Southeastern
Trains said: 'There was a report of smoke coming from underneath the 
7.17 Gravesend to Charing Cross.

'The train was spotted to be smoking on its approach to Hither Green station.

'Passengers
in the first four carriages were able to leave the train via the 
platform at Hither Green and those in the last four were evacuated onto 
the tracks.

'We had the emergency services on 
site and engineers are inspecting the train. We believe it was a problem
with the shoe gear, which draws power from the tracks, which could have
overheated after drawing too much.

'Tracks were electrified but power to the track was cut off by the signalman after reports of smoke were given to Network Rail.'

A spokesman for London Fire Brigade said: 'We were called at 7.56am to Hither Green station, South-East London.

'Two
fire engines were sent to but the train was evacuated and there were no
casualties. The incident was over by 8.36 and trains are running 
through the area again.'

However, other commuters using the busy line into London said that trains were prevented from moving until at least 9am.
