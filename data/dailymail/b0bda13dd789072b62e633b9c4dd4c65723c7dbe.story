Police made a dawn raid on four houses which were home to a Romanian 'car fraud gang', and seized £30,000 in cash and a top-of-the-range BMW from the house at the centre of their £1 million scam.

Four houses were raided in south east London, and at least two arrests were made as a part of the targeted police operation on the Romanian gang, in a clamp down on organised economic crime.

One of the houses they entered was thought to be an 'ID factory' where gang members were creating fake documents to open bank accounts.

Police made a dawn raid on four houses which were home to a Romanian 'car fraud gang', and seized £30,000 in cash and a top-of-the-range BMW from the house at the centre of their £1 million scam

Their scam allegedly involved bonus car adverts that were targeting thousands of motorists looking for cut priced cars on websites like Autotrader and Gumtree.

The gang members allegedly stole money from the 'buyers' without ever parting with the vehicles they had advertised for sale.

They are accused of then laundering the money through phoney accounts, withdrawing cash from cash points or transferring it straight out of Britain.

The alleged scam is thought to have hooked its prey by offering prospective buyers the chance to put money in a holding account before the final payments, followed by a test drive so a buyer could be sure about the purchase.

However, once the money transfer was made, the fraudsters would withdraw the money from the account, so the prospective buyer could not retrieve it.

Police also said 'mules” were paid to open account at banks using fake documents in order to launder the proceeds of the frauds.

Hundreds of ordinary Londoners looking for cars worth between £5,000 and £8,000 are thought to have been caught in the alleged scam.

A 30-year-old man was arrested in Charlton and is being questioned on suspicion of fraud and money laundering.

A 63-year-old woman was also arrested, by the UK Border Agency, on suspicion of being in possession of fraudulent immigration documents.

At the alleged 'ID factory' police found fake documents, two laptops, seven mobile phones and memory sticks, thought to be for use in opening fake bank accounts for money laundering.

The raids were carried out as part of Operation Subidor - an initiative launched by the newly-formed London Regional Fraud Team.

They were made by officers from City of London Police, Scotland Yard and British Transport Police, as well as officials from the Home Office.

Head of the new squad, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Fyfe, said: 'The fact that the unit consists of detectives from the three police forces serving the London region is evidence of the wider commitment from law enforcement to really clamp down on economic crime.

'With organised crime gangs increasingly targeting people who are prepared to make large purchases online, I would expect internet-related investigations and arrests to be a major focus for us over the coming months - with many more early morning visits to the homes of key suspects.'

A police spokesman said : 'Buyers who express an interest have been receiving emails, supposedly from eBay, offering to hold payment for the vehicle in an escrow account until it has been viewed and a price agreed.

'In theory, this would allow the buyer to release the funds securely rather than having to carry around thousands of pounds in cash.

'In reality, victims are finding the advert to be bogus and the money they transferred to have been quickly withdrawn - often out of cash machines -from bank accounts set-up with false details.'

DCI Fyfe said: 'I want people to be 
extremely cautious online and check what sort of payment or banking 
facility they enter into as you don’t know who you are dealing with 
until you have met them in person.'
