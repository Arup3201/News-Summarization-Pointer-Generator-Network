Stoke manager Mark Hughes has every intention of adding to under-fire Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers' misery.

A run of four straight defeats this month - including three in the Barclays Premier League - was finally ended with Wednesday's 2-2 draw in the Champions League at Bulgarian side Ludogorets.

Next up for Rodgers and the Reds on Saturday is what appears to be a tough Anfield clash with a Stoke side that has already won away at Manchester City and Tottenham this season.

Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is enduring a tough spell as his side continue a poor run of results

Liverpool's fixtures in the next three weeks: 

Stoke (h) Sat 29 Nov (Premier League)

Leicester (a) Tue 2 Dec (PL)

Sunderland (h) Sat 6 Dec (PL)

Basle (h) Tue 9 Dec (Champions League)

Man Utd (a) Sun 14 Dec (L)

Bournemouth (a) Wed 17 Dec (League Cup)

Arsenal (h) Sun 21 Dec (PL)

Hughes feels some of the criticism heaped on Rodgers has been unfair given he has been without two players this season who scored 55 goals between them for Liverpool last term.

With Luis Suarez sold to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge out for the last three months and not expected to return until the new year due to a thigh injury, it is no wonder Rodgers is feeling the heat.

'When people sense there is a little bit of pressure building then everybody jumps on the bandwagon and tries to add to it, which is unfair,' Hughes said.

'But that happens to all of us. It's not something Brendan is unaware of. He understands how it works.

'But when you lose the services of two strikers such as Suarez and Sturridge, then it's going to impact on you.

'There were only three players in the Premier League last season who scored more than 20 goals, and Liverpool had two of them.

'So that shows where their season was built - on the back of two outstanding strikers.

'They haven't had their services this year so it's going to take a big part of their game away from them.'

Naturally, for Hughes it is something to exploit, even if it means piling the pressure on Rodgers.

'They've a big squad that can manage any number of games they have ahead of them,' the Welshman added.

Rickie Lambert, who joined in the summer, scored only his second Liverpool goal  against Ludogorets

'I saw a picture in the paper the other day that showed the strength of their bench, worth something like £100million, so they do have resources they can use.

'The focus that seems to be on them at the moment is maybe something they need to deal with, and if we can add to that, then we will try to do that.

'But they're an outstanding team, with great players, and although it's a tough test for us we've proven this year we can go anywhere and get positive results, so that's our intention again.'

Injured striker Mario Balotelli is yet to score a Premier League goal for Liverpool since returning to England 

The trip to Liverpool sparks a tough stretch of fixtures for Stoke as they also face Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea in the run-up to Christmas.

Despite that, Hughes said: 'We're looking forward to them.

'The big teams are always the test, but we're playing well, despite last week's defeat to Burnley when we didn't play poorly, we just made mistakes, which can happen.

'But confidence-wise we're in very good shape, and that's off the back of a very good performance against Spurs the week before where we won comfortably in my view.

Stoke are without on-loan midfielder Victor Moses, who is sidelined for up to eight weeks with a thigh injury

'So we can go to the bigger teams, the teams with more resources and in terms of playing staff, and give a good account of ourselves, as we've already proven this season.'

A virus that had swept through the training ground this week appears to have eased as three players off sick on Thursday all reported in for training on Friday, with no new casualties.

Goalkeeper Asmir Begovic and defenders Phil Bardsley and Geoff Cameron are back in contention.

Two other defenders in Erik Pieters and Marc Wilson are also available after missing the loss to Burnley with calf and hamstring injuries respectively.

Hughes, though, is without on-loan midfielder Victor Moses who is sidelined for six to eight weeks with a thigh injury.
