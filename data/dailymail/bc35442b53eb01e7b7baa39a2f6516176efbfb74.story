Ministers faced fresh accusations of a cover-up last night after refusing to reveal crucial details of British meetings with US politicians investigating CIA torture.

Home Secretary Theresa May was one of several British politicians and envoys who paid 24 visits to senior members of the Senate Intelligence Committee as it investigated barbaric techniques used on terror suspects.

The disclosure has fuelled claims that the Government desperately lobbied to keep allegations of Britain’s complicity in torture out of the committee’s damning report.

In the end, there was not a single mention of Britain’s security and intelligence services when the dossier was published this month, highlighting horrific mistreatment of detainees by the CIA including beatings, waterboarding and rectal feeding.

No 10 has admitted that MI5 and MI6 held negotiations with the committee about blacking out any passages that might compromise ‘national security’. But Mrs May insisted she hadn’t discussed redacting details about Britain when she visited committee chairman Dianne Feinstein for talks in September this year, claiming they discussed other issues.

The Foreign Office has refused to reveal the topics on the agenda at meetings attended by Sir Peter Westmacott, Britain’s ambassador to the US, between June 2012 and July 2014 – when the explosive document was being compiled. 

Documents seen by the Mail, obtained under freedom of information laws, show the department has refused requests for ‘agendas, minutes and other notes relating to or recording the issues discussed’.

Officials claimed they could not release the information because it would harm ‘international relations, conduct of public affairs, legal professional privilege and commercial interests’. Curiously, it does not cite national security. 

The decision provoked fury last night among campaigners for the truth about Britain’s alleged complicity in torture by US agents.

Donald Campbell, from the human rights charity Reprieve, said: ‘It is bad enough that the Government has U-turned on its promise to hold an independent, judge-led inquiry into British involvement in torture.

‘But worse still, there is mounting evidence that they lobbied the Americans to keep information about UK complicity in torture secret. The sheer number of meetings between the British ambassador and the Senate committee which was examining CIA torture smacks of a cover-up.

‘We need to know what happened in those meetings: Was the committee pressured to remove or redact information about British involvement from the report? The Government must stop dragging its feet and release this evidence now.’

The Mail told this week of the existence of a list detailing how ministers and diplomats met committee members 24 times in six years – equivalent to once every three months. The access prompted questions about the influence successive British governments tried to exert to ensure the country was not tainted by torture revelations.

The report did not mention Diego Garcia, a British territory in the Indian Ocean leased to the US military, which ministers have admitted was used as a stop-over for extraordinary rendition flights in which suspects were moved to secret prisons to be tortured.

The freedom of information request was made in August but the Foreign Office has failed to give a final answer, instead responding with a series of ‘holding’ replies saying it is still making up its mind. A spokesman said a decision on whether to release the information was in the public interest would be made in the New Year.
