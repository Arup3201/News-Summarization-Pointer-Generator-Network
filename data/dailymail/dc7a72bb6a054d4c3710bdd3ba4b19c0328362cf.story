Alleged vigilantes have paint-bombed a car outside the home of Ian Brady’s confidante Jackie Powell, it was revealed today.

Police were called to Brynhyfryd estate, south Wales, after white paint was splattered across the vehicle last Saturday morning.

It is unclear whether the car belonged to Miss Powell, Brady’s mental health advocate for 13 years, and whether it was targeted by vigilantes because of her links to the serial killer.

Paint-bombed: This car was vandalised while parked outside the house of Ian Brady's confidante Jackie Powell

Neighbours were shocked when they found the car covered in paint with a trail around it.

Miss Powell’s next-door neighbour Julia Howells said: ‘I think it’s been a long time coming to be honest.

‘Obviously with my car being in the drive maybe it could be a target.

'Long time coming': While police would not confirm the owner of the vandalised car, one neighbour said: 'I think it's been a long time coming to be honest'

‘I really think the message is strong now, just go away please and don’t come back.’

Another neighbour said it happened during the night.

She said: ‘I didn’t see anything but I woke up and the car was covered in paint.

‘It could have been anyone. We are a bit too close to it.’

Police were unable to confirm who owns the silver soft-top Renault but a spokeswoman said they were investigating.

She said: ‘Dyfed-Powys Police are not able to confirm who the victim of crime is but we can confirm that a vehicle was damaged in the Brynhyfryd, Llangennech, area.

‘Inquiries to trace those responsible are now under way.’

Neighbour Wendy Williams said: ‘This was my concern originally because it was so publicised that something would happen. It’s awful.’

Miss Powell, who visited Brady frequently in jail since 1999, was arrested in September over a mystery letter handed to her by the child killer thought to contain the location of his only undiscovered victim.

She was arrested on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body after becoming embroiled in controversy following her participation in a Channel 4 documentary, Endgames Of A Psychopath.

On camera, Miss Powell said Brady had given her a sealed envelope to be opened after his death, which would reveal the location of 12-year-old Keith Bennett’s body and ‘allow (Keith’s mother) Winnie Johnson to find peace’.

Victim: Miss Powell said on a TV documentary that Brady gave her sealed letters which might reveal the location of Keith Bennett's body

He is the only one of the child killer's five victims whose body has never been recovered.

Miss Powell speculated that the 
contents might reveal the location of the boy’s body on Saddleworth 
Moor, which overlooks Oldham.

Keith was snatched off the street by Brady 
and his girlfriend Myra Hindley as he walked to his grandmother's house 
in Longsight, Manchester, on June 16, 1964.

His mother Winnie Johnson dedicated her 
life to finding her son's body, making several thousand trips to the 
Moors in search of her son, but died of cancer just days after Powell's 
arrest unable to fulfill her wish.

Mrs Johnson wrote ‘hundreds’ of letters to Brady begging him to reveal where Keith’s body is buried before she died in August.

Brady and Hindley lured children to their deaths in the 1960s, torturing them before burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Oldham. 

They were jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Pauline Reade, 16, who disappeared on her way to a disco on July 12 1963; John Kilbride, 12, who was snatched in November the same year; Lesley Ann Downey, 10, who was lured away from a funfair on Boxing Day 1964, and Edward Evans, 17, who was axed to death in October 1965.
