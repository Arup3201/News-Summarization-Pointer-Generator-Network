Huguette Cllark was one of the wealthiest women in America when she died age 104

Three of the relatives fighting for a share of Huguette Clark's fortune now stand to inherit a further $6.3million each.

The siblings' windfall is as a result of the death of Timothy Henry Gray. The reclusive heiress's great-half -nephew, Gray died before he could even be told that he stood to inherit $19million.

Gray, 60, died of hypothermia shortly before Christmas. He was homeless and his body was discovered under a railway bridge in Wyoming.

As he was not married and had no children the sum, which Public Administrators were fighting to secure for him, will now be divided by his three surviving siblings - Gerald Gray, Celia Gray Cummings and Alice Gray Coelho.

Speaking to Mail Online, attorney John Morken who is representing 19 of the 21 potential distributees, described this latest development as 'a very sad part of a very sad story.'

Mr Morken, a partner at prestigious New York firm Farrell Fritz who specialises in trust and estate litigation, said that he was hopeful that the family's case would reach a settlement.

He revealed: 'There are efforts to settle it going on and that's certainly a possibility. Another possible outcome is a Summary Judgement whereby the issue is deemed so clear that there is no need for a trial.'

The family remain prepared to go before a jury should no agreement be reached. Mr Morken and his team have gathered and
scrutinised thousands of documents and taken hours of depositions including ones from 
doctors and nurses entrusted with Huguette's care in a discovery process which began in June.

Court papers were lodged last 
Feburary in the bid to prove that the heiress, who was 104 when she died 
two years ago, was not in a fit state to sanction her second Will, written
in April 2005. While all who are fighting were named in her first Will, 
the second makes no mention of the family members - some of whom had not seen their reclusive relative for 40 years.

It divides her estate between her 
nurse, goddaughter, attorney, accountant, hospital, doctor, favourite 
museum, various employees and an art foundation that Huguette, herself a
talented artist, wanted established at her oceanfront estate, 
Bellosguardo, in Santa Barbara.

The family
claim that Huguette, 'was not competent to make a Will in that she did 
not know the nature, extent or value of her assets.' Conservative 
estimates place the fortune, inherited from her father Montana Senator 
William Clark's copper mines, at $307million.

They paint a picture of a vulnerable woman, who had retreated mentally and physically from the real world, and was coerced and defrauded by her closest advisors - attorney Wallace Bock, accountant Irving Kamsler - and nurse, Hadassah Peri.

Mr Morken described a court-ordered accounting of Huguette's finances as overseen 
by Bock and Kamsler in the last 15 years of her life as, 'a chilling 
report of mishandling, misappropriation and mismanagement.'

Great wealth in the Gilded Age but Huguette's copper mining fortune never brought her happiness

Huguette's is a strange 
and sorry tale. During her life she regarded her great 
wealth as 'a menace to happiness.' When she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the 
only people present at her burial were funeral home employees.

'Everything stopped for her when her mother died'

She had spent the the final two decades of her life in seclusion in New York's Beth Israel Hospital. She wasn't ill. Ironically it was her fear of illness and dying that saw her effectively give up her life some 20 years before her death.

While she lived a solitary life her three fabulous homes sat empty: the $100million Bellosguardo estate, a $24million country house in Conneticut and a $100million co-op, the largest apartment on Fifth Avenue overlooking Central Park.

According to Andre Baeyens, Huguette's great-half-nephew, a former French Ambassador and one of the relatives embroiled in the legal battle, 'Everything stopped for her when her mother died.'

Huguette's mother, Anna, was 39 years younger than Sen Clark who was a widower when they met following the death of his first wife. Most of the relatives fighting for the family fortune are descendants from that first marriage.

From the very beginning Huguette's life was touched by intrigue and tragedy. No record was ever found of the marriage between French-born Anna and Sen Clark which supposedly took place in France five years before her birth.

Unfazed by public opinion Sen Clark, who paid little attention to ethics and fulfilled his ambition to enter politics by buying votes, set Anna and his daughter up in a Fifth Avenue apartment that cost three times more than the Yankee Stadium.

He was as wealthy as Rockefeller, a product of the Gilded Age who made his fortune in copper mines, timber and banks and owned the land that would one day become Las Vegas.

Huguette's only sister, Andree died of meningitis age 16 and Huguette grieved her loss to the end.

She briefly married a bank clerk, William Gower but the marriage foundered within months and ended in divorce after two years. And so Huguette's retreat from adulthood began.

Speaking to NBC last year Msr Baeyer said: 'She didn't want to go out. She didn't want to have beautiful things. She just wanted to be home and play with her dolls.'

Huguette collected dolls obsessively - on her mother's death she filled her apartment with them.

Huguette occupied the entire eighth floor of the Fifth Avenue building while her mother had an almost equally large apartment on the 12th. She always referred to it as 'mummy's apartment.'

The two women were constant companions following the end of Huguette's brief marriage. In stark contrast to her father's greed Huguette was generous to the point of extravagance.

During the Great Depression she and her mother tore down their Santa Barbara home and rebuilt it just to give people jobs. She sent dolls to friends as surprises, once buying two first class seats to Paris: one for a doll and one for her personal physician to make sure it arrived safely.

She paid $342,000 a year in tax and upkeep on her New York apartment, employed gardeners and groundkeepers and effectively funded a life she herself did not live.
