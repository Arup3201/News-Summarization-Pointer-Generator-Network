A royalist great-grandmother has died on her 100th birthday meaning she missed out on receiving a card from the Queen by six hours.

Clara Asquith was looking forward to receiving the card which arrived at her home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, at lunchtime, but she passed away at dawn.

Her daughter, Maureen Hepplestone, 79, said her mother's health had been failing but she was determined to reach the milestone age on February 20.

She said: 'My mother wanted to reach her 100th birthday but also wanted to see the card from the Queen which would have meant so much.

'It is sad she died just a few hours before the card arrived and never saw it. She died at about dawn and the mail came at midday.

'She was looking forward to it and talked about it and would have been disappointed that she never got to see it. She had gone downhill the final week.

'My mother had a very long life and it is amazing to think she lived through two world wars and so many prime ministers. She must have seen so much.

'She just used to say I'll live to be 100 and to get my letter from the Queen, but she didn't go on about it.

'My mother was a staunch royalist and used to write letters to the Queen Mother about all sorts. It's a shame she never got to see her letter but I am going to frame it.'

A farmer's daughter from Slaithwaite, she was married to Herbert Henry Asquith, who died on the eve of his 70th birthday. The pair met at a local skating rink and he worked for the family meat business.

The mother-of-two was a committed Christian and worshipped at St Peter's Parish Church in Huddersfield for most of her life.

Clara always took care of her appearance and rarely went out without hat and gloves.

Mrs Hepplestone, from Golcar, said: 'She was known by all the staff in Peter's, the Huddersfield department store, and Boots, where she was always found at the beauty counter.

'She was very involved with the church, likes her gardening and liked visiting but had to stop that when she was 97.'

Clara, who had nine grandchildren, many great-grandchildren and two great-great-granddaughters, lived independently until she was 97, after that she moved to Knowle Court care home in Golcar.

Mrs Hepplestone has a sister Sylvia Schofield, 78.
