If you are on the hunt for that killer accessory to complete an outfit then designer Reid Peppard could have just the thing.

The American artist, working under the name RP/Encore, creates taxidermy artworks and jewellery based on casts of the teeth, bones and organs of animals.

Macabre fashion fans can find pigeon wing hair combs (£450), headdresses (£850) and cufflinks (£115) on her website ... or if you are after something a bit more special she creates one-off pieces such as the £2,900 fox handbag complete with Swiss topaz eyes set in 22ct gold settings, hand cast metal teeth and a black velvet lining.

The Central Saint Martins graduate, who recently transferred from London to LA, has released three animal-based jewellery and accessory collections - on vermin, park life and pet themes - and already has a celebrity fan base including Lady Gaga, Ozzy Osbourne and Jude Law.

Reid claims that her work is entirely ethical as the animals she uses have already died of natural or unpreventable causes (they are often discovered and donated by friends).

As a fashion graduate her fascination with taxidermy led her to study the craft under a master taxidermist in Yorkshire England and she opened her London studio in 2008.

If you are after something a bit more special Ried creates one-off pieces such as the £2,900 Fox Handbag

The Fox Handbag comes complete with swiss topaz eyes set in 22ct gold settings, hand cast metal teeth and a black velvet lining

She says: 'The pieces created are rich in narrative and beautifully conceived, designed to not only adorn, but to foster debate and spark conversation about the things we wear, why we wear them and where they come from.

'Designed for both men and women, 
these pieces are anatomically precise artifacts, links to the 
scavengers, hoarders and predators that inspire my work.'

Her latest collection 'PET' features regular metal jewellery inspired by and cast from a bunny, a cat and a canary, she says: 'This collection is a playful look at the domesticated animals we share our lives with.'

Her first collection, VERMIN featured rats, mice and 
pigeons. The second collection PARK continued the exploration of  the theme of urban 
wildlife in London, with specific attention given to the grey squirrel, 
red fox and carrion crow.

Reid says: 'In myth and popular folklore, these 
animals have very distinct characteristics. These stories, coupled with 
increasing human isolation from the natural world create a rich 
foundation on which I base my work.'
