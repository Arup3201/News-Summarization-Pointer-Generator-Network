An Australian woman who married the Le Pont du Diable Bridge in Céret, southern France last year, has celebrated her one year anniversary by reflecting on the trials of marriage.

Jodi Rose, or Mrs Le Pont du Diable, spent a decade traveling the world recording the vibrations in bridge cables with contact microphones and using them to create experimental music before she found 'the one'.

In an exclusive reflection letter given to the Daily Mail Australia, Ms Rose revealed how difficult the separation from her 14th century stone structure husband has been since she returned to her home in Sydney.

'I have struggled this year – coming back to Australia without him was tough, in particular the sense of displacement, from building a life on the other side of the world that I hoped we could live together,' Ms Rose wrote.

'To facing my family and friends with only a conceptual husband, who can't leave the banks of his river home. Trying to figure out how – and indeed if - I can fit back into Australian culture, or if I will find my place in this country again.

'Sadly our marriage certificate was not enough to convince the authorities to allow me to stay in France as his partner.'

The artist also reflected on fond memories shared with her significant other, whose name is translated to mean The Devil's Bridge, since their wedding day on June 17 when they married in front 14 guests.

She revealed she has struggled since the French government refused to grant her a visa and failed to recognise her marriage to the historic bridge

'I would love to be with him now. Eating those amazing plump cherries from the orchards around Ceret... and drinking the fabulous Le Maudit (The Devil) red wine from Domaine Treloar, family vineyard in Roussillon as we watch the sun set together,' she wrote.

'The wedding truly was a spectacular celebration and I feel like our journey is still just beginning.

'We both have a lot of growing and discovery to do, both on our own and on our shared path...this time apart has certainly helped our love grow stronger.

'I have forsaken all other bridges, and will be ecstatically reunited with my sexy French devil soon.'

Despite their union not being legally recognised in Australia or France, Ms Rose hopes to be able to head back to visit her husband before their second anniversary.

'His vibrations are calling me back to Europe and I look forward to being reunited with my bridge love in the French Pyrenees,' she said.

'I think that our story has a lot more to unfold, and there is definitely the possibility of baby bridges along the way.'

The Sydney based artist plans to release an exhibition and publish a memoir about her experiences, including her symbolic marriage.
