New footage has emerged from last Friday’s violent clashes in the Ukrainian port city of Odessa, showing a man wearing medieval armour in a bid to protect himself in a violent riot.

The pro-Russian protester could be seen dressed in knight’s armour and covering his neck in chain mail.

Meanwhile, Ukranian nationalists on the other side of the protest were filmed gathering nearby rubble, throwing it to the ground so that it shattered into smaller pieces that could easily be thrown.

The protesters could be seen smashing rubble, one man even using a pick to break it into smaller pieces.

The smaller missiles were then hurled towards the pro-Russian separatists.

The clash then became so violent that one man, wearing a balaclava and draped in a Ukrainian flag, yelled: ‘Calm down! Don’t touch the cops!’

Medics struggled to treat the mounting number of injured rioters being moved to the outskirts of the clash.

Crowds began to gather around the already packed ambulances, with ambulance officers unable to even let them into the vans.

There was little medics could do beyond putting antiseptic ointment on the men's wounds and covering them with bandages.

At one point a group of rioters took an injured protester to an ambulance – only to discover the ambulance was full of already injured men.

Against the backdrop of a more peaceful protest up the road, one woman pointed to teenagers and said: 'Have a look on what they’re doing.’

‘They’re screaming filthy words while they haven’t achieved anything in their life.’

Many of the protesters at the more violent of the two protests appeared to be younger men, a lot of them dressed in football jerseys.

The protests were a precursor to the violent riot that erupted at Odessa’s Trade Union Hall, where 46 people died.

Many were killed in a fire that erupted at the trade union building, after a pro-Ukraine march led to violent clashes on the nearby streets.

In an attempt to boost confidence in the Kiev-based central government, an elite national guard unit were sent to patrol the streets.

Odessa’s police chief was fired following the violent clash. The Ukrainian government also fired Odessa’s acting governor on Tuesday – replacing him with Ihor Palystya, a member of parliament.

Ukrainian authorities are blaming Moscow for the unrest that is gripping the nation’s east.

The pro-Russians are calling for greater autonomy from Kiev’s central government, with some favouring separatism or even re-joining the Russian Federation.

Anti-government movement leaders say they are planning to hold a referendum for eastern regions of Ukraine on Sunday.

Russia and Ukraine met with European and U.S. leaders in Geneva on April 17, signing an agreement calling for the dissolution of Ukraine’s illegal military formations.

Both Russia and Ukraine are now accusing each other of having broken the agreement, which has done little to quell the mounting conflict in eastern Ukraine.
