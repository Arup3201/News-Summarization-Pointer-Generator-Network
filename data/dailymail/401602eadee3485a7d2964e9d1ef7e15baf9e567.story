Hundreds of foreign workers set fire to cars and clashed with police during a riot in Singapore tonight.

The disorder, which is rare in the city state, broke out in Singapore's Little India district after an Indian worker was reportedly hit and killed by a bus.

It is believed to be the worst outbreak of violence in Singapore for 40 years.

Ten police officers were injured as about 400 people rioted, flipping police cars and smashing ambulances with sticks and garbage bins.

Singapore Police Force said the riot 
started after a fatal traffic accident.

'Shortly after, a riot broke out
 involving a crowd of about 400 subjects where the subjects damaged five
 police vehicles and one ambulance,' it said in a statement.

Incidents like this are rare in 
Singapore, which has tough laws on rioting that carry a sentence of up 
to seven years in prison and possible caning.

Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong that 'whatever events may have sparked the rioting, there is no excuse for such violent, destructive, and criminal behaviour, according to ABC.

'This
 is a serious incident which has resulted in injuries and damage to 
public property,' said Teo Chee Hean, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
 of Home Affairs. 'Police will spare no efforts to apprehend the 
subjects involved in the riot.'

The area is popular among Indian, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, Sri
 Lankan and Nepali expatriates and is usually busy on Sundays as South Asian workers enjoy their day off.Â 

The violence is likely to fuel concerns about discontent among low-paid foreign workers.

Last year Singapore saw its biggest outbreak of labour unrest in years when around 170 bus drivers from mainland China went on strike illegally.

Police brought the riot under control at about 1am on Monday morning, local time.
