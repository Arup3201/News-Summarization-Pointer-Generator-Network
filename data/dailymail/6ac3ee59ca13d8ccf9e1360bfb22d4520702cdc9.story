Surface-to-air missiles may be stationed on top of flats as the last line of defence against a suicide jet targeting this summer’s Olympic Games.

Soldiers would take over the roof of a converted factory which is home to 700 residents and has commanding views of the Olympic Park.

From there, they could use a multi-million-pound laser-guided system developed for modern warzones to shoot down a helicopter attack or suicide bombers piloting an aircraft.

Launch site: The Army will station soldiers and high-velocity surface-to-air missiles on this residential block in Bow Quarter, East London, to ward off airborne terror threats

The range of the missiles is 3.4miles, which means they could reach St Paul’s Cathedral, Canary Wharf or parts of the North Circular from the flats in Bow, East London.

But the short range raised fears that dozens could be killed by falling wreckage if a target is hit.

The move is one of the final links in a defensive ring of steel around the Games.

HMS Ocean, the largest ship in the Royal Navy, will anchor in the Thames to serve as a floating base for more than 800 marines.

Last line of defence: Starstreak short-range missiles

Typhoon jets and helicopters will 
patrol the skies as a 23,000-strong force of security guards, including 
soldiers, bolsters up to 12,000 police officers on duty.

News
of the missile system comes just three days after an operation to deal 
with a suspected suicide bomber in Central London showcased the 
intimidating array of weaponry held by police in the run up to the 
Games.

For the Olympics, a team of ten soldiers, protected by police, will operate the Starstreak missile system from the top of a former Edwardian water tower in Bow, 900 yards from the edge of the Olympic Park.

The building forms part of a Grade II-listed gated redevelopment of the former Bryant and May match factory, where homes sell for up to £350,000.

Leaflets were delivered to the 700 residents at the weekend telling them the missiles would be used only as a last resort.

The Ministry of Defence said the presence of a military team and police protection around the clock will make them safer.

Soldiers will deploy to the building next week during a full dress rehearsal of Olympic security, but the missile system will be loaded only with dummies.

If it is given the go-ahead, the Starstreak system will be in position for up to two months during the Games, which start in July.

Resident Brian Whelan, 28, said his suspicions were raised when he saw soldiers examining the water tower a few weeks ago.

He said: ‘I don’t think in a democracy the military go round occupying private property and turning it into a military base without communicating with people.’

Local MP Rushanara Ali said she would be raising the matter in Parliament tomorrow.

She said it was ‘unprecedented’ for missiles to be placed on residential buildings, adding: ‘This is a heavily built-up area. There has been no consultation – people have been told that this is what is likely to happen and people are very worried.’

The MoD said no final decision had been made on the missile deployment.
