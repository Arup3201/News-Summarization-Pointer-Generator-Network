Swallowing
 balloons could be the solution for serial yo-yo dieters who are 
reluctant to undergo more extreme weight-loss surgery. A new treatment 
takes the form of two salt-water-filled spherical 'bubbles' that sit in 
the stomach, giving the sensation of fullness, even when nothing is 
eaten.

The procedure involves no incisions or stitches, leaves no scars and is completely reversible.

Gastric
 balloons, as they are known, have been used for more than a decade in 
Europe. But many more determined over-eaters say they still feel hunger 
pangs, despite undergoing the procedure, which costs upward of £3,000. 
There is also the concern that after the implant is removed, the modest
 weight loss is regained.

Claire Cope has learned healthier eating habits, and pictured right, before she had the balloon fitted in 2010

The latest device is said to fit the 
curved shape of the stomach and  the manufacturers believe it has the 
potential for greater weight loss, as the double balloon occupies 60 per
 cent more space in the stomach than the traditional types.

By the 
time it is removed after six months - the period the manufacturer 
guarantees that the balloon, which is made of medical-grade silicon, 
will remain safely intact - the average user has lost two stone.Studies
 have indicated that intra-gastric balloons can lead to clinically 
meaningful weight loss of up to 40 per cent of excess weight after six 
months.

A US trial on 30 patients using the new ReShape Duo balloon 
concluded that the weight loss in those who had the balloon was greater 
than those who had diet and exercise counselling alone. Another benefit 
was greatly improved gastrointestinal tolerance compared with those who 
used a single balloon device.

Costing £5,500, the procedure takes 
just half an hour, during which the patient is sedated - but not with a 
general anaesthetic - so they stay reasonably aware of their 
surroundings but don't feel pain.A fine flexible tube with an 
attached camera called an endoscope is inserted into the patient's 
stomach via the mouth and is used to guide another tube called a 
catheter and the uninflated dual balloon into place.

The two parts 
are then each filled with 450ml of saline, using a separate tube. This 
is about 300ml more than is used to fill an old-style single gastric 
balloon. After six months  the device is deflated and removed using a 
similar procedure.

Patients can go home the same day and the balloon
 doesn't change the size or shape of the stomach - it simply ensures the
 patient feels full.

'This treatment is most suitable for those with a
 body mass index [BMI] of 27 to 35,' explains Dr Theodore Ngatchu, who 
carries out the procedure at his clinic, 9 Harley Street in London.

'It
 must never be used in people with a BMI of less than 27, but it  can be
 useful in certain cases where a patient has a BMI of over 35 and needs a
 head start with weight loss for medical reasons.

'For example, I've
 put a gastric balloon into people who have heart disease and are 
awaiting a bypass but need to lose weight in order to have major 
surgery.'

Side effects include nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps 
for a few days as the stomach reacts to having an alien object inside 
it.

While this would result in early removal of a standard singular 
balloon, the sympathetic shape of the new device helps reduce the risk 
as the two balloons sit more steadily in the stomach.

Dr Ngatchu 
warns that ReShape Duo is not suitable for everyone. 'Those with a 
hiatus hernia cannot have the balloon inserted as it can cause them to 
have respiratory problems,' he says. 'Similarly, if you've previously 
had gastric - that's stomach, not abdominal - surgery it's not possible 
to have the balloon because there's an increased risk of rupture due to 
weak scar tissue in the stomach and the combined pressure of the balloon
 and the stomach muscles.'

Claire Cope became one of the first people
 in the UK to undergo the procedure in June 2012. She has since lost 
more than two stone.

Back then, she was an overweight driving 
instructor with a BMI of 30 that rendered her clinically obese and left 
her with pain in her feet  and ankles.

With the device in her 
stomach, she dropped from 13st 7lb to 11st 3lb and from a dress size 18 
to a 12. 'I'm 5ft 7in and until a decade ago I'd consistently been a 
size 10 and weighed 9st 7lb,' says Claire, 40, who is now a retail 
manager and lives in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, with RAF husband Jeff, 
55. They have two children Tom, 18,  and Gemma, 20. 'But then I turned 
30, stopped smoking, swapped cigarettes for biscuits and hunks of bread 
spread with butter, and became a driving instructor. As my weight 
soared, I was in thrall to every faddy diet going. I tried everything 
but didn't lose a stitch.'

Claire had the balloon inserted one 
morning and was home by late afternoon. Three days later she was back at
 work. Dieticians supervise the patient's progress for 12 months, 
advising them on sensible eating and portion control.

Claire says: 
'I continued to eat the same foods I have for the past 30 years but my 
portion sizes were dramatically different and by the second week my 
hunger had waned.

'I could no longer polish off a 12in pizza - two 
slices were plenty. One potato with my Sunday roast and veg was enough 
where once I'd eat a pile of them. The weight dropped off at a rate of 
about 2lb a week.'

Having lost 2st 4lb, Claire was understandably 
anxious that she might start over-eating again once the balloon was 
removed. Although she did gain 4lb, she has maintained her weight at 
11st 7lb for the past  12 months.

Up to 80 per cent of people regain some weight within a year of having an intra-gastric balloon removed.

Claire
 admits: 'I was relieved when the hunger pangs I expected to kick in 
didn't. The eating habits I learned during those six months with the 
balloon remain intact. I still stop at a few squares of chocolate rather
 than demolishing a whole bar.'

Dr Ngatchu adds: 'It's important  to continue with sensible eating and regular exercise once the balloon has been removed.'
