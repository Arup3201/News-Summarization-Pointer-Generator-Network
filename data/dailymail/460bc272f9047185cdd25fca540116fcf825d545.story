Organic food is seeing a revival with sales up £1.4million a week amid evidence of nutrition benefits and the launch of budget ranges in discount stores.

The market is bouncing back from a disastrous downturn in the wake of the financial crisis and cost of living squeeze that forced families to cut back their food budgets.

Total sales in 2014 exceeded £1.86billion, taking them back up the level last seen in 2009.

Families are buying more organic food, particularly dairy produce, despite the fact that they have made big cut backs on conventionally produced food, according to a study by the Soil Association.

The value of sales of organic products increased by 4per cent in 2014, despite a general fall in all food spending of 1.1per cent in the year.

More than a quarter of spending on organic products - 27.9per cent - is in the dairy aisles with sales of milk and yoghurt up by 6.5per cent, which is in stark contrast to the 3per cent fall in non-organic products.

Sales of organic eggs were up 15.8per cent, against a fall of 6.2per cent for conventional eggs, while chicken was up by 8.2per cent compared to a fall of 3.3per cent for the non-organic equivalent.

Organic fresh fruit sales were up 6.4per cent, tea by 13.7per cent, cereals by 4.2per cent and biscuits by 7.2per cent.

There was a dip of 2per cent for organic vegetables, however the fall was a fraction of the five-fold reduction in spending on vegetables from other sources.

More than eight in ten households bought some organic products in 2014, according to research by the Soil Association, which sets industry standards.

The nutritional credentials of organic received a significant boost last July when landmark research from Newcastle University showed organic fruit, vegetables and cereals were up to 69per cent higher in a number of key antioxidants.

The higher levels of the antioxidants, which are recognised as being beneficial in preventing cancer, were equivalent to eating 1-2 extra portions of fruit and vegetables a day.

The same research also found lower levels of toxic heavy metals and reduced exposure to pesticides.

The Newcastle study was a huge boon for the industry which had previously suffered following a report from the Food Standards Agency which found no meaningful nutritional benefits.

A decision by Aldi and Lidl to promote organic food has also delivered a huge increase in sales. The chains are supporting the sector in the belief it will help attract the middle income families they are trying to win away from the major supermarkets.

Aldi sells a 1.14litre (2pint) carton of organic semi-skimmed milk for 89p, which compares to 75p for the conventional equivalent. A box of six organic eggs is £2 at Tesco, which is double the price of the free range equivalent.

Chief executive at the Soil Association, Helen Browning, said: ‘Three years ago, commentators were writing off the organic market in the UK. Now, with a third year of steady growth, and against a falling overall food market, it’s clear that reports of organic food’s demise were premature to say the least.

‘This reinvigoration may be partly related to an improving economy, but it’s also testament to the fact that retailers and manufacturers who continued to invest in organic lines have continued to thrive. Now, even the discounters are beginning to stock organic ranges.’

The Produce World Group is the UK’s leading grower and supplier of fresh organic vegetables. Its director of agriculture, Andrew Burgess, said: ‘The continuous growth of organic products, despite numerous challenges in the retail environment, highlights the strength of the organic sector.

‘We know from our own figures that more people are buying organic, with taste and quality being big reasons behind this consumer trend.’
