Juan Mata is looking to score more goals this season after settling in at Manchester United ahead of the start of the new Premier League campaign.

The Spain international was signed from Chelsea for a club record £37.1 million in the January transfer window and he has praised his teammates for easing the transition to his new club.

Asked if he felt comfortable at Old Trafford, the 26-year-old told manutd.com: 'Yes I do, and this is down to the players in the dressing room who have helped me a lot. They are a great bunch of lads who made it really easy for me in my first six months.

Band of brothers: The 26-year-old has thanked his teammates for helping him settle in at Old Trafford

'At times during last season there were hard moments for everyone but I always tried to do what I do which is to score goals and set my team-mates up. 

'I scored six goals last year and I am looking forward to hopefully do it again and again this season.' 

Mata was largely used out of position by then manager David Moyes, with the playmaker admitting he found it difficult at times.

‘It was difficult last season,’ said Mata. ‘We had changed managers but didn’t get the results. But we are starting a new season with a new manager and we aim to put the club back where it deserves to be. 

'Things are changing and everyone is finding their new role in the team. That includes me.’ 

New manger Louis van Gaal has returned Mata to his preferred No 10 position just behind the strikers - from where the Spaniard was twice named Chelsea's player of the season before Jose Mourinho decided he was surplus to requirements at Stamford Bridge.

‘If I play behind the two strikers I feel comfortable,’ he said while on the club's pre-season tour of the United States .

‘I have played on the left or right but my best season was when I played in that position under Rafa Benitez for Chelsea. I will try my best, during the season hopefully we can play good football and I can do assists and score goals because that is what I have to do.

‘We feel the manager is a great manager who has brought a strong mentality. This club is made for a winning mentality and I think he has it. We are happy with him and the way he works. Everything is new but we are adapting well to his style of football.’
