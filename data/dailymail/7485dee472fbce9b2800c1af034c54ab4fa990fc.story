Legal 'victory': French writer Tristane Banon today dropped all legal action against 'sex attacker' Dominique Strauss-Kahn

French writer Tristane Banon today dropped all legal action against ‘sex attacker’ Dominique Strauss-Kahn, but warned him to ‘keep a low profile’.

The development came as increasingly sleazy allegations about the 62-year-old’s involvement in an international vice ring came to light.

Ms Banon, now 33, maintains that the former International Monetary Fund chief tried to rape her in a Paris flat in 2003.

Judges agreed that she had been 
sexually assaulted but - because the statute of limitations for such a 
crime in France is three years - police stopped investigating last week.

Ms
Banon said she was satisfied that Mr Strauss-Kahn’s status as a ‘sex 
attacker’ had been proved, and that she had achieved a legal ‘victory’.

‘Police recognised that he assaulted me but cannot charge him,’ Ms Banon told the Canal Plus TV station in Paris.

‘This
means he is officially a sex attacker, and officially I am not a liar. 
My status as a victim has been established and I am dropping my action.’

Mr
Banon added: ‘I expected him to apologise, but I think it’s too much to
ask that gentleman. I advise him above all to keep a low profile.'

Under fire: Dominique Strauss-Kahn, pictured leaving a polling station in Paris on Sunday, was accused of trying to rape Ms Banon in 2003

This is the second time in three months the former IMF chief has been cleared of sex charges. In August, U.S. prosecutors dropped charges that he had raped a maid in a New York hotel room in May.Ms Banon first spoke out after Mr Strauss-Kahn was arrested on charges of attempting to rape a maid at the Sofitel Hotel in New York.U.S. prosecutors eventually dropped the charges after finding the cleaner, 32-year-old Nafissatou Diallo, had told a number of lies.However just 24 hours later, Mr Strauss-Kahn was implicated in an investigation into underage prostitution. He is among politicians and business leaders allegedly named in a ‘black book’ of clients at a luxury hotel which was said to double as a brothel.A judicial Inquiry into prostitution at Carlton Hotel, in Lille, was opened in March amid claims underage girls were involved.Prostitution is legal in France, but those offering sex must be over 18. French Closer magazine, which published the claims, said it has seen prosecution documents which say Mr Strauss-Kahn, 62, used prostitutes at the hotel.

A source close to Mr Strauss-Kahn said he had 'no comment' to make on the allegations.

She said she would now campaign for the statute of limitations for sex assault to be increased to ten years.

She has published a book giving her side of the incident where she describes Mr Strauss-Kahn as ‘le couchon’ (the pig).

Mr Strauss-Kahn strenuously denied Miss Banon’s claims.

'Eight years ago, the pig stole my life,' writes Ms Banon at the beginning of 'The Hypocrites' Ball' ('Le Bal des Hypocrites').

Ms Banon refers continually to the alleged crime in her 126-page book, but leaves out the name of Mr Strauss-Kahn.

This is a common tactic adopted by French authors as they try to avoid libel charges relating to what they have written.

Despite this, publicity for the book makes it perfectly clear that the book is auto-biographical.

Mr
Strauss-Kahn also faced trial for allegedly trying to rape Nafissatou 
Diallo, a 32-year-old chamber maid, in a New York hotel earlier this 
year, but also escaped prosecution in that case.

Now he is preparing to speak to judges about allegedly taking part in an orgy in the U.S. city just days before his arrest.

Judges
sitting in Lille have so far arrested five men linked with a vice ring,
and some of them are said to have travelled to New York with 
prostitutes to meet Mr Strauss-Kahn.

He is also said to have taken part in orgies from girls from the same ring in luxury hotels in central Paris.

At
the start of this year, Mr Strauss-Kahn was the most powerful banker in
the world, and the hot favourite to replace Nicolas Sarkozy as 
president of France next spring.

Now
he is unemployed and living in Paris with his long-suffering third 
wife, Anne Sinclair, a former TV journalist who has stuck with him 
throughout his legal problems.
