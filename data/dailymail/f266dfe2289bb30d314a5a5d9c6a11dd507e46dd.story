Neymar will miss Saturday's Spanish league match against Getafe as a precaution because of a sore left ankle, Barcelona have confirmed.

In a statement released Friday, the Catalan club said the Brazil star's recovery would be monitored to determine when he can begin training again.

Neymar, who scored in Barcelona's comeback 3-1 win against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday, is the only player other than Belgium defender Thomas Vermaelen - who has a long-term injury - who is not available for selection by coach Luis Enrique.

The painful ankle forced Neymar to leave practice early on Friday.

Barcelona currently sit second in the La Liga table, five points behind rivals Real Madrid, but with a game in hand.

Madrid played on Friday night, beating Almeria 4-1. Isco, Gareth Bale and a double from Cristiano Ronaldo secured maximum points for Carlo Ancelotti's side. 

The Barcelona man will be monitored by club staff to see when he is able to start training again
