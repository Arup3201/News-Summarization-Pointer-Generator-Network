Controversy: Former EC president Jacques Delors made a u-turn over Britain's role in the single market

One of the key architects of the European single market today admitted Britain would be better off leaving the European Union.

Mr Delors's radical U-turn comes 22 
years after he infuriated Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and other 
Eurosceptics by trying to force European federalism on the UK.

In November 1990 the economist became the subject of a famous headline in the Sun newspaper which read: 'Up Your Delors!'

Frenchman Jacques Delors, who was president of the European Commission three times, suggested that 'the British are solely interested in their own economic interests, and nothing else. We could offer them another kind of partnership.'

In an interview in the German economic daily Handelsblatt, Mr Delors continued : 'If the British do not follow the tendency towards more integration in the European Union, we can anyway stay friends, but in another way.'

Mr Delors suggested Britain might sign up for an agreement 'like that of the European economic area' or a 'free trade agreement'.

If Britain does leave the EU, said Mr Delors, the country would still be a 'partner', because it is 'strategically and economically important'.

But, in a typically cutting aside, Mr Delors said that 'other countries' were also important in the new economic order, including India and China.

The United Kingdom belongs to the EU since 1973, but has not joined the Eurozone.

On Thursday Herman Van Rompuy, the president of the European Council, warned that David Cameron's drive to repatriate powers from Brussels risks damaging the EU and could cause the collapse of the single market.

Mr Van Rompuy - who chairs the EU's 
summits - said the Prime Minister's attempts to achieve a new settlement
 with Europe were destabilising the 27-member bloc.

'If
 every member state were able to cherry-pick those parts of existing 
policies that they most like, and opt out of those that they least like,
 the union in general, and the single market in particular, would soon 
unravel' said Mr Van Rompuy.

He
 added: 'All member states can, and do, have particular requests and 
needs that are always taken into consideration as part of our 
deliberations. I do not expect any member state to seek to undermine the
 fundamentals of our co-operative system in Europe.'

Eurosceptic
 Conservatives are concerned that the party could lose out to UKIP, the 
UK Independence Party, in the 2015 general election unless Mr Cameron 
makes more effort to boost British sovereignty over Brussels.

Delors became the President of the European Commission in January 1985.

During his presidency, he oversaw 
important budgetary reforms and laid the groundwork for the introduction
 of a single market within the European Community, which came into 
effect on 1 January 1993.

In the autumn of 1988 Delors 
addressed the British Trade Union Congress, promising that the EC would 
be a force to require governments to introduce pro-labour legislation.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
responded with her famous Bruges Speech in September 1988, in which she 
said that she had not rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain 
only to see them reimposed by a Brussels superstate.

These developments were of key 
importance for domestic UK politics – as recently as the early 1980s 
large elements of the Labour Party had been opposed to British 
membership of the EC, whereas the Conservatives had favoured joining.

The Sun's now infamous headline made Prime Minister Thatcher's message loud and clear

Facing a fight: Prime Minister David Cameron will now have to confront his own party's Eurosceptic camp following the comments from Jacques Delors

After 1988, however, it was to be the
 Conservatives who were divided, with Thatcher and her supporters 
opposed to further European federalism.

On 1 November 1990, shortly before Thatcher was ousted as Prime Minister, Delors bore the brunt of British Euroscepticism.

The Sun's famous headline sent the message loud and clear with 'Up 
Yours Delors' in response to his supposed attempts to force European 
federalism upon the UK.

The proposal from Mr Delors prompts concerns France might be willing to cut Britain loose, boosting the influence of Paris, as the EU moves to fiscal and political union in 2014 in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis.

In a concerted campaign to keep Britain in Europe, Germany and senior European officials have warned that British demands to be able to "cherry pick" which bits of the EU it signs up to could unravel the whole bloc.

Prime Minister Cameron is under pressure to give the British public a say on whether to leave the EU, demands that will be fuelled by the comments from Mr Delors.

Mr cameron has said he supports continued EU membership but wants a 'new settlement'  involving Britain opting-out of justice measures and seeking exemptions to any further centralisation of power in Brussels.

He is widely expected to make a speech in the New Year outlining plans for a referendum in 2015, which would voters a choice between a new relationship with Europe and leaving altogether.

This includes committing to a national referendum on whether Britain wants to remain in the EU.
