'He is bailed to a date in January pending further inquires.'

In the early hours of November 3, the rapper called police saying he had been robbed of his Rolex near to his £1million house in South London.

But when police arrived at the scene they discovered a Mercedes had been in a crash with a van and arrested the rapper on suspicion of drink-driving.

He was held and spent a night in the cells before being bailed.

A
 police spokesperson said after the incident: 'There were no reports of 
any injured parties. Inquiries into the robbery and the collision are 
ongoing.'

His wife, Millie Mackintosh, was not thought to have been at home when he phoned police at 2:40am.

Green later tweeted: 'It's been a strange couple a weeks. Growing old doesn't equal growing up, not even when you want it to!'

A spokesperson for Green was unavailable for comment his morning.

Perverting the course of justice carries a maximum sentence of life in jail.
