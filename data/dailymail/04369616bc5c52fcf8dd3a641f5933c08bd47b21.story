A UFO spotted hovering above a popular beach has sparked mystery in a seaside resort.

The unidentified object was caught on camera flying over Summerleaze Beach in Bude, Cornwall, and has prompted people to take to social media in their droves in an attempt to decipher its origin.

The three-pointed object has been touted as an alien UFO, a drone and even a Russian bomber plane after it was photographed last week.

The mystery 'triangular' object (top right) was caught on camera hovering above Summerleaze Beach in Bude, Cornwall, and many believe it could have been a UFO, drone, RAF fighter jet or remote-controlled plane

The object has caused confusion among Cornish residents, with many unsure as to what the object could be. The photo was sent to the Cornwall UFO Research Group, which receives about 40 to 45 sightings every year

However, it has now been claimed the mystery object was a radio-controlled seagull, which was fitted with a camera before being flown through the skies. 

The great UFO mystery began on Thursday when David Gillham, of Cornwall UFO Research Group, posted a photo on his Facebook page of the object.

He accompanied the picture with the caption: 'Just received this photo 2 of 2 from a person in Bude. Any ideas what this object could be?

'Taken at Summerleaze Beach, Bude, N Cornwall 17th February 2015. Looks triangular....but I have no idea what it is? The second sighting I have witnessed around N Cornwall in two weeks.'

In a post just days earlier, he uploaded an image of a snowy field with a dark, unusual-looking object hovering in the sky above.

He captioned the photograph: 'Just received this photo 1 of 2 from a person in Bude. Taken at Davidstow, N Cornwall 3 February 2015.' 

He said both of the photographs were sent to him by a resident of Bude, who didn't notice the objects when he took the photos and only realised they were in the frame when he downloaded them to his computer.

The posts were greeted with dozens of responses who claimed the objects could be a drone or one of the RAF fighter jet's which were sent to intercept two Russian Bear bombers off the coast of Cornwall last week. 

Mr Gillham also received this photo via his Cornwall UFO Research Group, which was taken by a resident of Bude. He said he could not decipher what the dark object was situated in the top right hand-side of the frame

He said he had tried to zoom in on the object but had only managed to see a dark object due to the resolution

The bizarre object sparked mystery for days until Van Johnive claimed the object was in fact his uncle's remote-controlled seagull.

He told the Cornish Guardian: 'I can confirm that the "UFO" in the photo was my great uncle's Seagull RC Plane with a camera. 

'The photos are of before and during flight of the Seagull before we crashed it upon landing on the cliff.

'Please apologise for the confusion for us. Thanks.'

The lightweight model 'aircraft' is inspired by a seagull – complete with lifelike features and colourings – and is operated with an aerial and radio.

It is not known whether it was being used for fun or as a deterrent to other birds of prey in the area. 

It has also not been confirmed by any experts whether it was in fact the 'seagull' which was the UFO in the photographs.

The supposed revelation sparked surprise online, with many finding it rather amusing.

Jade Louise Ullrich wrote: 'So funny. The councils should get a load of these and use them outside food establishments to stop us getting attacked.'

While Lesley Hands added: 'Brilliant! If only all of life's mysteries were solved so easily.'

However, Mr Gillham said he was still rather dubious that the object was the remote-controlled seagull and not something more sinister, such as aliens.

He told MailOnline: 'I don't know whether it is that. One of the problems with the photo is that it was taken on a low resolution phone. I've tried to zoom in but all I get is a pixelated image.

'I did notice that in the top left-hand side there was a very bright area, a white light.

'One of things you've got to try and work out is the distance from the camera, where the object was seen.

'It's hard to judge because it's over the sea and the camera is quite far away but it seems a bit big to me to be a model seagull.'

Mr Gillham said he had never come across remote or radio-controlled seagulls before.

He said: 'It's the first time I've ever seen one, it seems he has some pretty hefty gear to fly it with.

'If the resolution was a lot better, I could've zoomed in and actually seen what it was but when I zoomed in you could just see black.'

In 2011, this 'UFO' was caught on camera flying through the sky at Trenarren near St Austell, Cornwall. The image was taken by a walker who only noticed the mystery object upon downloading his photos to his laptop

This photo by Michael Potter last year appeared to show a mysterious flash of light (left) above the seaside resort of Mount's Bay. It was never determined what the UFO actually was, but it may have been a meteor

It is not the first time mysterious objects have been spotted above the county and the Cornwall UFO Research Group claims the region has more paranormal activity than anywhere else in Britain.

Mr Gillham said he gets about 40 to 45 sightings every year and said they often 'come in waves'.

Last year, amateur photographer Michael Potter captured a 'mysterious object' flashing across the sky as he photographed cloud formations above the seaside resort of Mount's Bay.

The grandfather's erie photograph showed an unexplained flash of light streaking across the sky and he spent weeks puzzling over the identity of the UFO, which he initially thought was the result of a problem with his camera.

The object, which appeared to have a triangular shape, appeared in the so-called 'UFO Triangle', an area off the Cornwall coast where spooky sightings are common.

However, while its exact existence was never determined, sceptics suggested that it was likely to be a meteor burning up in the sky as it shot towards Earth.

And in 2011, a 'UFO' was caught on camera flying through the sky at Trenarren near St Austell, Cornwall.

The image was captured by a walker who didn't notice it in his photograph until he downloaded it to his computer hours later.

Mr Gillham, who founded Cornwall UFO Research Group in 1995, said at the time: 'The person who took the photo never saw anything in the area while taking the photo.

'It was only when he got home and downloaded it onto his computer that he saw an object - a disc shaped craft, hovering just above the sea.

'There appear to be two trails of water beneath the object which looks as though they are falling from it in to the sea.

'It could be that the object has just emerged from the sea.'

Mr Gillham could not shed any further light on the origins of the object, which left many scratching their heads for an explanation. 

However, some people pointed out that it could have been a seagull during mid-flight and Mr Gillham himself also said that RNAS Culdrose confirmed to him that it was a seagull.
