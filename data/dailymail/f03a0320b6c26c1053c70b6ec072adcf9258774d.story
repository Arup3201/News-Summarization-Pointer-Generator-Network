A heroic 93-year-old World War Two RAF bomber was left house-bound after his mobility scooter was stolen by thieves who broke into his garage.

Ron Brown, who flew 64 bombing missions over Nazi-occupied Europe, has now had a replacement bought for him by the Royal British Legion.

The theft, at his home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on November 18 last year, left him house-bound.

But yesterday his comrades in the Royal British Legion vowed to stump up £2,000 for a brand new one.

Mr Brown said: 'I can only walk about 50 yards, so I am dependent on it when I leave the house.

'Since it was taken, I have not really been able to go out.

'I had a heart attack about 18 months ago and I had just about fully recovered when this happened.

'Taking my scooter away from me was such a heartless thing to do.'

Mr Brown flew as a Bomber Command flight engineer and took part in 64 bombing operations with 218 Squadron and 75 New Zealand Squadron between 1939 and 1945.

Mr Brown's survival is exceptional, considering that Bomber Command crews suffered an extremely high casualty rate during World War II.

The brave crews endured a staggering 44.4 per cent death rate.

A total of 55,573 were killed out of a total of 125,000 aircrew, with a further 8,403 wounded in action.

He said: 'The legion has offered to buy me a new scooter, which I am very grateful for.

'I informed the police that the scooter was taken but, sadly, there has been no sign of recovering it.

'I am over the moon that the legion is making efforts to replace it for me.

'They are an absolute wonderful and caring organisation.

'The police have also been marvellous and have done all they can for me.'

Three years ago, Mr Brown suffered a stroke, which affected his mobility.

The scooter gave him independence and allowed him to do his own shopping.

A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said: 'The Royal British Legion offers support to any serving or ex-service personnel and their families today and for the rest of their lives.

'We would encourage anyone who meets this criteria and finds themselves in need of help to get in contact.'

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: 'The offenders had prised the garage door open and took the mobility scooter, which was on charge.

'House-to-house inquires have taken place to gather information and inform neighbours.

'Mobility scooter shops have also been visited to see if the scooter was being offered for sale.

'Officers have also checked social media and websites for anyone that is trying to sell the scooter.'
