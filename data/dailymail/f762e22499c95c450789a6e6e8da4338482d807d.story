Walking dictionary: Li Yanzhi has memorised the meaning of every word from the English-Chinese dictionary

A Chinese mother has become a walking dictionary by memorising the English-Chinese Dictionary from cover to cover, reported the People’s Daily.

Li Yanzhi, 51, from Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, is able to explain the meaning of every single word in the 2,458-page book, which consists of 220,000 entries.

Ms Li, who divorced more than 20 years ago, undertook the mission in order to receive more translating work.

This helps her support her 26-year-old son who suffers from autism and is not able to take care of himself.

Ms Li is a lecturer in Financial English at Xian Transport University’s Economic and Banking School.

Since August 2013, she has been reading the dictionary six hours every day from 3am. 

Within 19 days, she finished the memorisation for the first time.

According to People’s Daily, to succeed in the College English Test Band 6, which most university students in China are required to pass, the candidates need to understand 6,000 words.

In comparison, Ms Li's vocabulary is extraordinary.

To help her memorising, Ms Li borrowed 465 English language magazines from the university library.

'My biggest dream is to enter The Brain to challenge myself,' said Ms Li. The Brain is a popular reality TV show in China which uses a series of games, such as memorisation, to test the contestants' brainpower.

Ms Li said that son is autistic and cannot look after himself. Since her divorce more than 20 years ago, she and her son have been reliant on each other.

As a single mother, Ms Li had to lock her son in the house whenever she went out for work. She said when she returned the house was always a complete mess.

But she said she never gave up.

'If I can fly I will fly, if I cant fly I will run, if I cannot run I will crawl,' she said.'No matter what you must move forward.'

In order to improve their lives, Ms Li does translation work as a freelancer on top of her regular teaching. Through this, she has earned enough to buy herself a new apartment.

Apart from English, Ms Li has learned to speak more than 10 different languages, including French, Russian, German, Japanese and Polish.

She hopes that by memorising the 220,000 words from the dictionary, she can encourage students to learn English and increase their vocabulary.

'Lecturer Li really is a living English-Chinese Dictionary,' says Zhang Xinjie, one of her students.
