An assistant manager at a Northern California Burger King found a backpack loaded with about $100,000 in a booth, but so far no one has come forward to claim it.

Assistant manager Sahista Bakawla told KGO she spotted the blue backpack left in the San Jose eatery early Wednesday.

She said when it was still there by about 3pm that afternoon she called the owner of the store.

The owner took the bag out back and opened it, hoping to find identification or a phone number.

Unassuming: About $100,000 was left unattended in this blue backpack (left) for hours on Wednesday in the booth of a Burger King in San Jose before being grabbed by assistant manager Sahista Bakawla (right)

Whopper: Inside the bag was about $100,000, mostly in large notes, plus a small quantity of marijuana 

Birthday boy: Owner of the Burger King, Altaf Chaus, said he opened the bag on his birthday and joked that he thought it were a gift

Instead, he found a whopping amount of $100 bills.

'I said, ''Wow! Today's my birthday, this is my birthday gift'',' the owner, Altaf Chaus, told KGO.

However Chaus was only joking.

'I've been in this country 26 years and I worked two jobs for 15 years before I bought this Burger King,' he said. 

'So I'm a very hard working man. 

'I don't want that money, maybe it belongs to somebody.'

Scene: The bag was found in Burger King on North Bascom Avenue in San Jose on Wednesday

Cops: Police are now trying to find the owner of the backpack and its contents

Officers came to the restaurant and opened the bag, which also contained some candy, a small amount of marijuana and a bank deposit slip.

Police are now working with the bank to find the bag's owner. 

At least one customer was very happy to see how the store dealt with the situation.

'I would have done the same thing but to know that someone else did it, really makes me feel good,' said Mary Teixeira.
