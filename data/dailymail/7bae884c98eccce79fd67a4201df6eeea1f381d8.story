Not happy: Brandi Glanville has hit out at her love rival LeAnn Rimes

The war of words between Brandi 
Glanville and her ex-husband Eddie Cibrian's new wife LeAnn Rimes has 
taken a further extraordinary twist.

The
Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star took Cibrian and LeAnn to task on
Wednesday night, responding to an open email from her ex with her own 
abusive and hate-filled rant.

In
it Brandi accused LeAnn of being a heavy drinker, addicted to 
prescription drugs, having 'severe mental issues' and putting her 
children in danger.

She labelled the singer angelfish
'because she sings like an angel and drinks like a fish' and told her 
ex to 'man the f*** up, put the tequila down and be a proper parent.'

Brandi's claims were strongly denied by a representative for the singer, who told MailOnline the reality star was' 'spewing forth inaccuracies, rants and 
half-truths,' and added: 'None of Brandi’s allegations are true.  People
need to see it for what it is – publicity'.

Brandi later removed the tweeted 
message and admitted it had been a mistake, saying: 'I'm taking email 
down I was in defense mode after seeing [Cibrian] put his online.

'Let's not talk of them anymore I was wrong 2 put it up.'

Brandi's rant was just the latest in a series of exchanges between the two families.

It began when an interview was published on Us Weekly on Wednesday morning  in which Brandi accused LeAnn of having a 
'severe eating disorder' and claimed her son fell ill after swallowing 
one of the country star's laxatives.

The 40-year-old branded LeAnn 'unstable', adding that she didn't want Mason, nine and Jake, five, to be around her alone.

In the interview Brandi said: 'LeAnn has a severe eating disorder. She has [a laxative] in every purse.

'Mason,
my eldest, ate some of Le's candies and got extremely ill. And Le's 
candies are laxatives,' 'It was a big f***ing deal for me, and I lost my
mind.'

'Mason found on on 
the floor and thought it was a Skittle! They don't keep sugar in the 
house,' Glanville explains. 'He thought he finally found candy.'

She
added: 'I, unfortunately, don't find her to be stable and I don't want 
her around my kids when Eddie's not there - or at least the nanny, his 
parents, someone.'

Defensive: LeAnn Rimes with Eddie Cibrian before the online clash with Brandi Glanville

Cibrian then responded to Brandi's interview with a public email of his own which was published on Radaronline.

The 39-year-old weighed in saying: 'It is absolutely 
ridiculous that my ex-wife continues to put the personal lives of 
myself, LeAnn, our sons and my family on public display for the sake of 
her notoriety.

'She is fully capable and has the 
means of contacting myself and LeAnn privately to discuss any matter 
concerning the children.

'The fact she chooses not to, should be pretty 
transparent. And while I do not wish to fuel her ever-igniting fire, 
there is a breaking point where enough is enough.'

And he added: 'One day when wine and 
narcissism are not consuming you, you will realize how fortunate the 
kids are to have LeAnn in their life. She is amazing with them, as the 
kids will 100 percent attest to.'

He continued: 'The love they have for 
their "bonus mom" continues to grow each day as we navigate the changes 
to our family; a fact that Brandi cannot argue as she herself has stated
as much.

'If my ex-wife truly cared about the 
welfare of our sons, she would stop the constant bashing on an important
person in their lives and focus on productive co-parenting to make our 
blended family the strongest it can be. And she would do so privately. 
Let's see...'

In response Brandi published her email on Twitter.

LeAnn, who underwent a 30-day 
treatment program for stress and anxiety in August, has previously 
denied suffering from an eating disorder.

The confrontation comes
less than a week after Brandi hit out at the country singer, 30, for 
referring to her stepsons as 'my boys' in a Twitter post.

'They are my boys, Eddie's boys and your stepsons... for now,' a furious Brandi tweeted on November 30.  

She has also recently criticised LeAnn after she posted a video of one of her stepsons riding a bicycle without a helmet.

Eddie dumped Brandi, his wife of nine 
years, in 2009 after beginning an affair with married LeAnn on the set 
of their film Northern Lights.

He married the Blue singer in 2011.
