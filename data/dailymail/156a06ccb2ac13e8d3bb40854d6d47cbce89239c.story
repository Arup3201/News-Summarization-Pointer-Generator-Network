Following the trend for using more diverse models in campaigns, a brand has picked a grey-haired grandmother to not only star in its fashion campaign - but model its swimwear.

TK Maxx has picked eight British shoppers to star in their new Spring/Summer 2014 campaign, Me. By Me., including 82-year-old Martin from London and glamorous 62-year-old Olga, who looks fabulous modelling a swimsuit.

Olga Taylor, 62, from Twickenham, works in catering at her local college and much to her amazemant she was scouted while shopping in her local TK Maxx.

‘I never expected any of this to happen, I was approached one day whilst shopping at TK Maxx in Twickenham and at first I didn’t take it too seriously. After all, I’m 62!' says Olga.

‘It really is amazing how at my age and just for being myself I have been able to join in such a wonderful campaign and it’s something I really believe in. It makes me feel very proud!

‘The Me. by Me campaign really has been one of the best experiences to happen in my life the past 20 years.'

The grandmother, originally from Russia, admits she lacked confidence in front of the camera, until her modelling debut gave her a boost.

‘I have never modelled and I don’t particularly like how I look in photos, but by the end I felt really confident about being myself,' she says.

‘The whole experience has been nothing short of fantastic. I would never have dreamed in a million years at my age this experience could happen.'

Olga says the campaign has given her a new outlook on life. She plans to retire from her catering job later this year and live life to the max.

'This campaign has made me realise amazing things can still happen at an older age and life can still be really interesting.'

‘I still can’t believe this has happened; my friends here in the UK and my family in Russia are so excited and proud of me. I am now really looking forward to fully retiring -- there is so much to look forward to.'

Justina Taylor is another of the real people scouted by TX Maxx to appear in their Me. By Me. campaign

Olga's secrets to looking fab at 62? 'I try and avoid eating meals after 6pm and I would say my 
beauty essentials are fruit and berries. I'm always snacking on them and
 they provide so much natural goodness for your skin and body.'

This is the first time TK Maxx has gone into stores and plucked its own shoppers from obscurity to star in a campaign.

As well as the rather fabulous Olga, 
other models, who were scouted in TK Maxx stores across the UK include 
25 year-old Pia Sarkar, a student from London, and five-year-old Henry Hawley and his 38-year-old mum Alix.

Also starring in the Europe-wide campaign are 26-year-old Cameron Taylor, a travel enthusiast and beach aficionado from London and Justina Bailey, 28 also from London, a graphic designer and self-confessed creative nerd with a quirky dress sense.

They're also joined by Louis Dewhurst, 33, a dapper-looking sports therapist from Yorkshire and 25-year-old Pia Sarkar, 25, a Brixton-based student.

The ethos at the heart of the campaign is that people are at their happiest and most confident when they are their true selves. The adverts aim inspire others to celebrate the wonderful things that make them unique.

Me. By Me. is another illustration of the growing trend for big brands to use everyday women in their publicity.

In 2004 Dove sparked a global conversation about widening the definition of beauty when it launched its Real Beauty campaign using women from all walks of life in their billboard campaign.

Debenhams also paved the way by updating their in-store mannequins to reflect more everyday proportions.
