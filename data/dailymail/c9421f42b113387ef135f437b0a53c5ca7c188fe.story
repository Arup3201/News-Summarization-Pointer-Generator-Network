The search to find a baby that was stolen from a Chicago hospital 50 years ago received its strongest lead yet when a 49-year-old Dallas came forward saying he could very well be the missing child.

Sam Miller had been alerted to an age-profession image of Paul Fronczak, a baby stolen from his mother's arms a day after his birth in 1964 by a woman disguised as a nurse.

The investigation to find Fronczak was re-opened last year after a DNA test proved a man long-believed to be the missing child, who was found abandoned in a stroller in New Jersey in 1965 and subsequently adopted by the Fronczak family, was not actually him.

Adding to the uncanny resemblance, Miller also found a baby photo of Fronczak that looked just like he did as a child, ABC reported.

The photo of Paul Fronczak taken the day he was born (right) has been the only image investigators have had of the stolen baby since he went missing in 1964. Steve Miller produced a photo of himself as a baby (left) which had a remarkable resemblance

Steve Miller described the moment he first saw the image of Paul Fronczak as 'ghostly'

'We all just stood there in shock,' Miller told ABC News after seeing the image.

'I look like that guy and I have no idea where I came from.'

Miller, a Microsoft executive, grew up in a suburb outside Chicago but did not learn he was adopted until earlier this year after doctors told him his kidney disease, which he has battled for years, had taken a serious turn for the worse.

He called a cousin for information about the family's medical history.

The cousin told him he was adopted and that there was no such history of kidney disease in their family.

Miller, who is married with two children, has end-stage renal disease and finding his real family has become a life-threatening issue.

'So here I am. And I hope that I'm able to find a kidney, find my family and go on with my life,' Miller said.

'Because I'm kind of near the end.'

Pleading: Chester and Dora Fronczak made a televised appeal to return their baby boy. 'I don't think you're that desperate to come and take another woman's baby,' Dora said. The couple are now in their 80s

Where is he? The FBI fielded 10,000 babies in their search for Paul Fronczak, but still couldn't find the missing boy

As their own: Dora Fronczak reportedly said 'That's my baby' when she saw Paul. Nearly five decades later, it was revealed that Paul belongs to a different family

Unfortunately, original adoption papers obtained from a government office in Chicago proved that Miller was not Paul Fronczak.

'I have a brand new search,' he said.

Chester and Dora Fronczak only discovered last year that the baby they took in believing to be their long-lost son was not actually related to them at all.

It was one year after the child had gone missing that the baby, who they adopted and named Paul Fronczak, was found abandoned in a stroller on a street in Newark, New Jersey.

In a major TV interview with Barbara Walters, Paul Fronczak, 49, revealed the results of the DNA test he had undergone.

The search continues: Paul Fronczak spoke with ABC's
 Barbara Walters in August about his hunt to find his parent's real 
biological child, who was stolen from the hospital in 1964

'My main goal for this entire project is to find the real Paul,' he told ABC.

'My parents raised me and they did a great job and I feel that if I don't do everything I can to help find their real child - then I'm not doing my job as a son.'

ABC then started a 20/20 investigation to find the real Paul Fronczak - as did police - which is how Miller came to see the age-progression images.

The case continues.
