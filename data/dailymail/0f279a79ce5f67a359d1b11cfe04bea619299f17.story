Emmanuel Labram convinced his patient that she did not need further treatment by insisting she was cured of a tumour

A neurosurgeon who lied repeatedly to a patient, falsely telling her he had removed her brain tumour, has been struck off for 'reckless and deplorable misconduct'.

Emmanuel 
Kingsley Labram convinced his patient and her husband that she did not need further treatment
 by insisting she was cured for two years after the failed operation at 
Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in September 2008.

He then lied to 
colleagues and forged documents to keep up the deception, the Medical 
Practitioners Tribunal Service has heard.

When
 Labram told her the lesion had ‘recurred’ in 2010 she then decided to 
seek private treatment, which was partially successful, but the tumour 
was inoperable.

Labram
did not attend the professional disciplinary hearing in Manchester, 
which resumed today after a three month delay.

The
 fitness to practise panel, chaired by Dr Howard Freeman, ruled the 
doctor may have genuinely believed he had removed the lesion.

But
 he was found guilty of misleading and dishonest conduct for trying to 
cover his tracks when he realised this was not the case.

The panel today found him guilty of serious misconduct and ruled his fitness to practise medicine was impaired as a result.

Labram’s name will be erased from the General Medical Council’s 
register of doctors in 28 days, subject to his legal right of appeal, 
although the panel decided to impose an immediate order of suspension so
 he can’t work during that time.

The case had heard that after
 developing double vision on holiday in November 2007, the woman - known as Patient A  
- consulted her optician and was referred to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

An MRI scan revealed a
 tumour about one inch in diameter in an area in her brain known as the 
cavernous sinus and she saw Labram to discuss her options in June 2008.

She decided to go ahead with an operation and underwent surgery at the hands of Labram on September 2, 2008. 

Giving
 evidence earlier, Patient A said: ‘There was something going on inside 
my head and I really needed to find out what it is so Mr Labram offered me
 that.

‘If there was a good chance of removing the tumour that’s fantastic. That’s how I felt.

‘He
 explained how he would open up my head and try to remove the tumour and
 obviously the biopsy would be taken and sent to the pathologist and we 
would find out what type of tumour it is.’

After
 the operation Mr Labram told her it had been a success and explained to
 her husband that he had removed ‘100 per cent’ of the tumour.

But
 he only removed four tiny hard pale fragments, which could not even be 
used to determine what the tumour was as they were ‘non-diagnostic 
samples’.

But the operation at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (pictured) in 2008 had failed. He then lied to colleagues and forged documents to keep up the deception, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service has heard

Patient A said: ‘He said it’s all gone. He said it was just calcium deposits. That’s how he described it.’

Labram then sent letters to the patient’s GP telling him that no further treatment was necessary. 

In
 January 2009, the surgeon altered a pathology report and sent a forged 
copy to his patient in order to conceal the fact she might need further 
treatment. 

In May 2010 he 
told her he did not know the tumour was present when he operated on her 
and gave her another doctored pathology report with the author’s 
signature ‘cut and pasted’ in. 

Opening
 the case Craig Sephton QC, had earlier told the hearing: ‘This is a case where 
it is difficult to understand why Mr Labram initially told the patient 
and her husband that he had completely removed the lesion when he must 
have known that no such thing had happened.

‘He
 then lied and lied and lied in order to cover up his initial failure 
and the GMC will therefore invite you to conclude that is what has 
happened.’

Patient A 
made a complaint, and the hospital’s medical director ordered an 
investigation - but the doctor was able to continue working until 
October last year, when he took early retirement.

When
 quizzed about his actions during an internal disciplinary meeting in 
January 2011, Labram admitted his deception but said ‘he did not want to
 cause further stress to the patient,’ the tribunal heard.

Panel chairman Dr Howard Freeman said: ‘The panel considers that Mr Labram’s misconduct put Patient A at serious risk of harm, he abused his position of trust and he violated Patient A’s rights.

‘The panel is satisfied that Mr Labram’s conduct constitutes a very serious departure from the fundamental tenets of good medical practice.

‘Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Labram’s misconduct relates to a single episode it is concerned that his dishonest behaviour was persistent and covered up.

Dr Freeman said: ‘The panel considers that Mr Labram has displayed a reckless disregard for the principles set out in good medical practice.

‘The panel is of the view that patients and the public are entitled to expect medical practitioners to act with integrity.

‘It considers that Mr Labram has abused the position of trust which the public are entitled to place int he medical profession and that his behavior is unacceptable and fundamentally incompatible with his continued registration.’

Dr Freeman explained that the panel had taken into account Labram’s ‘long and distinguished career’ into account, including a period where he was the only surgeon involved in spinal intra-medullary lesions in the North East of Scotland.

But his misconduct was so serious, the chairman said, that it was fundamentally incompatible with him continuing to work as a doctor.

‘The panel is of the view that Mr Labram’s behaviour would be regarded as deplorable by fellow practitioners and by the public.’
