It used to be the time for the family to gather round the TV screen. But they are now just as likely to have spent Christmas Day gazing at a computer screen, experts say.

For more people were expected to shop online yesterday than will venture out to the high street today, a poll shows.

The survey by Barclaycard found that 31 per cent of adults planned to spend part of Christmas Day surfing for bargains while only 27 per cent planned to brave the Boxing Day sales.

This is because increasing numbers of retailers start their sales online on Christmas Day – or, in some cases, Christmas Eve. However, an estimated four million people are still expected to flock to the shops today, with more than £3 billion going through tills.

Experts say it is now considered socially acceptable to shun family time on Christmas Day in favour of online shopping.

Of those who went online yesterday, a third said they intended to wait until the evening when festivities were over, a fifth would shop during lulls in the day’s activities, but 12 per cent would shop in the early hours or immediately after opening their presents.

Online spending is up nine per cent this Christmas – compared with a 1.2 per cent rise instore – as shoppers hunt the best prices.

Barclaycard said shopping on Christmas Day has grown by about a quarter in the past two years.

‘The Boxing Day sales have traditionally been the day when we splash our Christmas cash,’ a spokesman said.

‘However, the relentless growth in online shopping – and ever-earlier sales – means that more and more of us are taking to the web on Christmas Day to secure the best bargains.’

Harvey Nichols, House of Fraser, Debenhams, PC World and John Lewis launched their online sales on Christmas Eve while Argos, Amazon and Selfridges started theirs on Christmas Day.

Retail expert Clare Rayner said: ‘Once the gifts have been opened and the turkey has been consumed, browsing online offers people an alternative to the boredom of the same old movies.

‘Retailers selling online can now capitalise on consumers who might otherwise have avoided the crowds in the sales. We’ve seen reports of people having “sale-rage” over discounted items in shops and supermarkets.

‘Shopping in the sales online, for many, is far more civilised and for the retailers it helps to reduce the queues, the staffing costs and the chaos in stores without missing out on sales.

‘Shopping malls and centres are often not enjoyable places to be in a mad post-Christmas sale crush. The main retailers can offer click and collect, so their stores still play a vital role in consumer experience.’

Research by Experian, the credit checking group, predicted 45million hours will be spent on retail websites across Christmas Eve, yesterday and today.

Despite the online Christmas Day spending boom, a record number of shops will open today.

People were expected to start queuing in the early hours outside major department stores such as Selfridges, Harrods and Liberty.

Extra security staff have been hired to try and head off a repeat of Black Friday.

The one-day sale, across many stores late last month, was supposed to fuel excitement about the Christmas shopping season, but descended into hostile scenes, injuries and some arrests.

The Boxing Day sales are far busier. A study by finance company Capital One suggests this may be because 45 per cent of shoppers have delayed buying Christmas gifts until today to save money.

Psychologist Dr Dimitrios Tsivrikos, of University College London, said the cost-of-living crisis had fuelled shopper anxiety as people feel under pressure to beat others to the bargains.

‘It is an almost caveman instinct,’ he said.

‘Where at one time, early man was fighting over food in what was a life or death battle for survival, now they are fighting over mobile phones and flat-screen TVs.’
