Fernando Ricksen is smiling. He is thinking of the family he has behind him. Thinking of partner Veronika, whom he recently wed, and their two-year-old daughter Isabella.

‘All the love and help that I get from them is special,’ he says. ‘I’m a happy man.’

Sitting in a Glasgow hotel, Ricksen looks like any other proud father. He doesn’t look ill. A little thinner than in his playing pomp maybe, but you could walk past him and never guess at the burden he carries.

Had his ups and downs: Former Rangers man Fernando Ricksen tells all in his new book, Fighting Spirit

It is only when Ricksen begins to speak that the creeping toll taken by Motor Neurone Disease becomes fully apparent in his slurred enunciation. It has been seven months since he revealed to the world, via a heart-breaking television interview, that he was battling this incurable condition which gradually erodes muscle control.

‘At the moment, I feel good,’ he says. ‘I’m not getting better but the most important thing is I’m not getting worse. I feel physically good, only my talking is poor.’

He is back in the city that was once his playground during six years as a Rangers player to attend the UK launch of his autobiography. It is the story of a life lived to the full, if not quite the full story.

Asked if he had left out any tales within his catalogue of high-octane mayhem, Ricksen begins to laugh. Co-author Vincent de Vries reveals the one-time Holland international told him only about 50 per cent of what actually happened was included.

‘I don’t want to hurt other people,’ insists Ricksen. ‘We left out most of the other names in the book. At least those names who have family lives. We didn’t want to cause any divorces…’ 

It makes you wonder just what else went on. The stuff that has actually made it into print is a riotous blend of drink, drugs and sex. Lots and lots of sex.

There is excess, addiction and redemption. For long enough, Ricksen seemed to tackle every aspect of his existence with the manic intensity that made him such an on-field success.

Fan favourite: The Dutchman spent six trophy-laden years at Ibrox between 2000 and 2006

Struggle: Ricksen revealed he was battling Motor Neurone Disease seven months ago

It was during the project of writing the book that he began to feel there was something wrong. His illness is covered only in a short, defiant epilogue.

‘Within a few years you kick the bucket, in normal cases,’ he writes. ‘Normal cases, yes. But I’m not a normal guy.’

Ricksen draws strength not only from his family, but from the numerous fans who have sent their best wishes. He received a phenomenal ovation at Ibrox in January when he took to the field at half-time in a match against East Fife.

‘The reaction I have had has been amazing,’ he admits. ‘From the moment I knew I was ill it has been incredible. Everybody has been there for me.

‘It has helped me to stay positive and just accept what is happening. It was in the summer of last year that I realised I was not well. I got the final diagnosis and it was difficult, very difficult.

‘But I got an incredible reaction when I came back to Glasgow and went to Ibrox. Going on to the pitch that day will stay with me. When I saw the fans I became really emotional.

‘From the moment I came to Rangers until the moment I left, that was the best time. I will treasure these memories.’

Ricksen
 hopes to see his old club back at the top but has little interest in 
the endless boardroom turmoil at Ibrox. ‘I’m fighting another battle – 
not that one,’ he says.

His
 book was released in Holland last November and has topped the 
bestseller list en route to selling 70,000 copies. According to de 
Vries, money earned from it will be used to fund Isabella’s education 
and protect her future.

She
 will also one day be able to read about many of the naughty things her 
dad got up to during a career that encompassed Fortuna Sittard, AZ 
Alkmaar and Zenit St Petersburg, as well as Rangers.

Ricksen,
 though, felt it was important to be as honest as he could be, as long 
as he was only implicating himself in the juicier yarns.

‘It is great to see my life in print,’ he says. ‘I am very proud of the book. 

‘A lot of what is here was on the front pages of newspapers at the time, so a lot of people already know some the things that I’ve done in my life.

‘People have asked me, “How do you remember if you were always drunk?” But I do remember, I remember everything and all aspects of my life.

‘Some of the stories are nicer to tell than others. But I don’t have any regrets - if I did I would have no book.’

Spent the evening: Ricksen had a one-night romp with Katie Price

Alcohol was Ricksen’s main vice of choice in Scotland. Cocaine became prevalent in Russia. The women were plentiful in both.

Ricksen once spent a night with glamour model Katie Price when at Rangers. Then there was a period when four strippers shared his apartment in St Petersburg.

He was not, it’s fair to say, an easy player to manage. Dick Advocaat did so at both Rangers and Zenit, but it was an incident when on Holland duty that most upset The Little General.

The Dutch team hotel in Minsk just happened to have a strip club in the basement. Ricksen stepped into it after a game against Belarus and was still there five minutes before the bus back to the airport was due to depart the next morning.

He made it - but only after kicking down the doors to both his own room and that of Ruud van Nistelrooy in a desperate search for his bags.

‘I was still drunk at nine in the morning,’ admits Ricksen. ‘Dick wasn’t happy. After that, I was never called again to the national team.

‘That hurt me the most. The money didn’t matter. It was always about football. But if I was the coach, I would have done the same as Dick.’

Former team-mate Nacho Novo spent time with Ricksen at the book launch and is among a host of star names who will play in a testimonial game in Sittard a week tomorrow.

‘I have been trying to keep my emotions in check and just speak to him as usual,’ says the Spaniard.

‘This illness shows you that you need to enjoy life every day. To see him laugh and joke the way he does is unbelievable. I don’t know how I would take it in his position. But Fernando has always been a fighter.’

He’s still fighting. And still smiling.
