Ministers will announce a major climbdown on fracking today as they bring in strict controls to protect vast swathes of the British countryside.

Shale gas development will be all but banned in National Parks and other protected countryside – and permitted only in ‘exceptional circumstances’.

The move from the Department for Energy and Climate Change is likely to be seen as an attempt to head off a potential revolt in Middle England over fracking in the run up to next year’s election.

It was welcomed by countryside protection groups yesterday – but will cause dismay among industry and pro-fracking groups, who say the controversial method will cut energy bills, create jobs and deliver decades of energy security.

The move tears up bolder suggestions from ministers last year that more than 40 per cent of Britain could be opened up for fracking – as the restricted areas cover huge parts of the county, especially in the Tory heartlands of Southern England.

The announcement is in sharp contrast to the rhetoric of former Energy Minister Michael Fallon, who was moved to Defence Secretary in this month’s reshuffle.

Last year he said fracking would take place in vast swathes of ‘Dorset all the way along Hampshire, Sussex, East Sussex, West Sussex, all the way perhaps a bit into Surrey and even into my county of Kent. It’s right there.’

He added: ‘We are going to see how thick their rectory walls are, whether they like the flaring at the end of the drive!’

Last night new Energy Minister Matthew Hancock said: ‘The new guidance published today will protect Britain’s great national parks and outstanding landscapes.’

The rules will apply to all National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, World Heritage sites and the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads.

Natural Beauty areas make up one fifth of Britain’s countryside, and National Parks 10 per cent of the land area in England.

In these areas fracking would only be allowed in ‘exceptional circumstances’ and when it was clearly in the public interest, DECC said.

If, as it appears, fracking is severely limited in these areas, it would put a new focus on development in Northern England. A report last year suggested Bowland Shale in Lancashire could contain 1,300trillion cubic feet of gas which could provide for Britain’s energy needs for decades.

Drilling: Proponents of fracking claim is will slash bills, create jobs and deliver energy security

Fracking has already proved to be hugely controversial, sparking protests in Balcombe in West Sussex. Ministers also said that planning appeals would be called in by the Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to ensure the rules are being closely observed over the next year.

Applications for licences to develop onshore oil and gas in or near the sensitive areas will also have to include new environmental awareness studies.

Whitehall sources insisted the rules did not amount to a ban on fracking in National Parks. One said it would put fracking on the same footing as onshore wind farms.

The industry is expected to react badly to the announcement, which is made today as ministers invite new bids for licences to develop shale gas. Around 150 licences are expected to be granted.

Once it is approved, a developer will also have to secure local planning permission before drilling can start. Energy investors are likely to see the Whitehall guidance as a tide of red tape which could slow or inhibit shale development.

But local communities and some Tory activists will welcome the shift away from fracking in their areas.

Shaun Spiers, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said ‘change in rhetoric is very welcome’, adding: ‘The Government has previously stoked opposition by giving the impression that it is committed to fracking whatever the consequence and however sensitive the location.

‘If fracking is to happen, we need to proceed with great caution and with the highest possible safeguards.’

A National Trust spokesman said: ‘We hope it will reflect a much more cautious approach that recognises the risks of turning some of the most special places in the country over to industrial scale extraction of shale gas and oil.’
