Julianna Margulies has said that she was 'unbelievably flattered' to see Michelle Obama wearing her Good Wife outfit at the President's State of the Union address on Tuesday.

Speaking on the red carpet at the SAG Awards, the actress admits that she did not even know that the First Lady had worn the grey Michael Kors suit until the following day.

She said that when she woke up, 'there were literally 89 emails' in her inbox alerting her to the news - a volume she was stunned by.

Flattered: Speaking on the red carpet at the SAG Awards, Julianna Margulies admits that she did not even know that the First Lady had replicated her on-screen look until the following day

'My first thought was, "how on earth did anyone remember?"' she said. 

Ms Margulies, who plays Alicia Florrick, the wife of a disgraced politician in The Good Wife, added that she was 'unbelievably flattered' to see Mrs Obama replicate her on-screen look.

And it is an ensemble that carries a strong message for whoever wears it.

'It says I'm powerful, I'm elegant, I'm feminine - but don't mess with me,' she said.

While the skirt of the suit is no longer available to buy online, the jacket is currently on sale at Neiman Marcus, reduced to $797 from $1,595.

It is described as having an origami-inspired portrait collar and a two-way front zip.  

Ms Margulies originally wore the Michael Kors suit in season five of The Good Wife.

The hit drama sees her in the title role of Alicia Florrick, the wife of former state attorney Peter Florrick (played by Chris Noth), who was jailed following a notorious political corruption and sex scandal. 

The actress hit the SAG Awards red carpet in a royal blue Giambattista Valli gown with a deep slit at the front.

She is nominated in the category of Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series. 

Guests: Mrs Obama was surrounded by nearly two dozen individuals who have benefited from President Barack Obama's initiatives on Tuesday night, including (top row, L-R) Victor Fugate of  Missouri, Dr Pranav Shetty of Washington, DC, Judy Gross, Alan Gross, Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly, (bottom row) Astrid Muhammad, Anthony Mendez,  Rebekah Erler of Minnesota and Dr Jill Biden, wife of vice-president Joe Biden
