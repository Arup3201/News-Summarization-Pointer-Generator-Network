New research from Which? consumer magazine has revealed the best and worst hotel chains in the UK - as voted by the customers themselves.

Members were polled on thousands of hotels stays within the last year and, collectively, rated 29 chains based on nine categories, including cleanliness, customer service and value for money.

Luxury chain Sofitel was ranked highest in seven out of the nine categories, scoring an impressive 83 per cent in customer satisfaction.

Most-frequented chain, Premier Inn, likewise fares well - scoring an 82% in overall customer satisfaction

In third place, Warner Leisure Hotels likewise rank highly in cleanliness, bedrooms/bathrooms, and food

But it was Premier Inn, the most-used chain in the nation, which came in second, with a customer score of 82 per cent.

The second most-used chain, however, fared far worse.

Travelodge, with 500 properties around the UK, only racks up a 60 per cent customer score, though this is up 10 per cent from last year, likely due to it's £57m modernisation programme.

And languishing at the bottom of the table? Britannia Hotels - with an abysmal customer score of just 33 per cent.

Members have commented that the chain, which has been used by the Home Office to house asylum seekers, is comprised of 'run down' hotels that are 'well past their best-by dates.'

This is the second year in a row that Britannia Hotels has come in last. 

Which? travel editor Jill Starley-Grainger said: 'It can be a bit of a lottery staying with popular UK hotel chains as there’s such a massive gap in standards between the best and worst. 

'Hotels that have fared badly need to look at their customers’ feedback and learn where they need to up their game.'
