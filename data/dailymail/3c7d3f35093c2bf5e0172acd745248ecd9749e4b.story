Liverpool striker Fabio Borini says they have 10 days to get their season back on track.

Last season’s title pretenders have had a poor season so far with new recruits struggling to gel and the injury to Daniel Sturridge proving more damaging than expected.

But Borini, who figured in recent defeats by Real Madrid and Chelsea, believes the international break can help Liverpool put right their wrongs ahead of a visit to Crystal Palace on November 23, the site where their title challenge ended last season.

Borini, who remains a January target for Inter Milan and Sunderland, said: ‘The feeling here is that we have 10 days to work hard and focus on ourselves.

‘We can work hard on what we need to do to improve and take that into the game against Crystal Palace and then Ludogorets.

‘We’ve got to focus on the positives and return to winning ways. We need to find confidence and belief, focus on us first and be really concentrated on what we do. We need to just pass all the rest because that’s how you perform well.

Talking to Liverpoolfc.com, he added: ‘We played better [against Chelsea] than we had in the previous league games. But to lose 2-1 is obviously a disappointment. We can’t be happy about a loss in the league, especially against one of the contenders for the league and one of our rivals.

‘But there are positives - the way we played and the way we started the game, which was a lot better than what we did in the games before that.

‘But we lost three games in one week and when you lose three times you become tired of losing. Now it’s actually [going to be] easier to get up and fight because you want to win and you want to show that the winning mentality is our mentality.’

Borini, 23, has worked hard to make an impression despite it appearing his Anfield career was over in the summer.

‘I think that when I was called upon to play, I did well against Real Madrid or against Chelsea, when we were down and we needed to chase the game,’ said the Italian.

‘Against Newcastle, we were at 0-0 and we needed to change the game. So it’s not an easy way to get in, but it’s good to be involved and I hope I get more [chances].

‘In training I work hard every day, so I’ve got the game rhythm every day. So it’s easy for me to get into the game, like I showed against Swansea. I had been out for six weeks and then I came in and played 90 minutes and was fine.’
