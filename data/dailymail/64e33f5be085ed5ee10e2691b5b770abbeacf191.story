Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said cyber attacks are happening on an industrial scale

Britain’s intelligence agencies are today launching a Facebook-style site to share information in a bid to combat a growing terrorist threat.

UK networks are often attacked by other states, criminals and companies seeking secrets, costing billions of pounds.

Now, experts from government communications body GCHQ, MI5, police and business will work together on a new partnership designed to defend industry and government against attack. 

Those using the Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CISP) will be given access to a web portal, described as a 'Facebook for cyber security threats', which will operate on social network lines. 

Analysts, based at a secret location in London, can then choose who they share information with in real time.

Large screens will monitor attacks and provide details in real-time of who is being targeted.

Then a  group of 12-15 analysts with security clearance will work mainly during office hours.

The partnership will provide industry figures with a forum to analyse techniques of online attack,  and how authorities can best counter methods used by cyber terrorists, the Telegraph reports.

In 2012, the head of MI5 Jonathan Evans said the scale of attacks was 'astonishing', the BBC reports.

One major London listed company incurred losses of £800m as a result of cyber attack from a hostile state because of commercial disadvantage in contractual negotiations.

A government official told the BBC they had seen the volumes of attack increase and expected it to rise further still. 

The
plan revealed today has emerged out of a 2012 pilot scheme known as 
Project Auburn, which saw 80 companies, including finance, defence, 
energy, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals - encouraged to share 
information.

The pilot was then expanded to 160 firms, with more expected to join after today's announcement. 

Government officials say they continue 
to be uncomfortable with an EU draft directive which would force business to disclose when they have been attacked.

Companies previously have been nervous of revealing publicly when they have been attacked because of the potential impact on reputation and share price if they are seen as having lost valuable intellectual property or other information.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude said: 'We know cyber attacks are happening on an industrial scale and businesses are by far the biggest victims in terms of industrial espionage and intellectual property theft, with losses to the UK economy running into the billions of pounds annually.'This innovative partnership is breaking new ground through a truly collaborative partnership for sharing information on threats and to protect UK interests in cyberspace.'

Howard Schmidt, former White House Cyber Security Adviser, added: 'In the US, we have seen the emphasis that President Obama has placed on cyber security and in particular steps to protect our critical infrastructure.

'Many senior leaders in private sector companies are supporting it and recognizing it is not only a security issue but a business imperative.

'The launch of the UK CISP is an important step in forging an ongoing partnership between industry and government, promoting information sharing by providing the ability to analyze and redistribute information in a timely, actionable and relevant manner.'
