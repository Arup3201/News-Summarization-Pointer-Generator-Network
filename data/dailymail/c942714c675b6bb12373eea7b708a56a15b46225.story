Chancellor George Osborne is mulling the plan to persuade firms to take on more young people

Firms could be offered a tax cut if they hire unemployed young people.

Chancellor George Osborne is considering a plan which would mean national insurance was not pay for jobless under-25s given work.

While the total number of people out of work has fallen in the last year, the number of unemployed young people has remained stubbornly high at almost 1million.

Mr Osborne is expected to use next month’s Autumn Statement to unveil measures to get more people in their teens and twenties into work.

Latest figures show there were 965,000 unemployed people aged 16-15, of which two third were not in full-time education.

It has not changed at all in the last year, and is still 40 per cent higher than the level seen before the 2008 crash.

Under the plan put to Mr Osborne, businesses would not pay employer’s national insurance contributions if they hire an unemployed person who is under 25.

It is argued that the move would actually save the Treasury money, because the £520 annual cost per young worker is less than paying them to be on benefits.

In theory hiring every unemployed young person would cost £287million a year, compared to the £10billion bill for youth unemployment.

The number of 18 to 24-year-olds who have been out of work for more than a year has risen to 281,000.

The numbers claiming Jobseeker's Allowance for more than two years has almost doubled this year.

The idea is being pushed by the Million Jobs campaign, which argues that money used for Jobseekers Allowance would be better used to persuade firms to take on young people.

Flatlining: Four years after the financial crash, the number of young people out of work has remained stubbornly high at around 1million

Director Lottie Dexter said: ‘Despite all this talk of economic recovery, for many young people across the country nothing has changed.

‘Youth unemployment continues to be sky high and hovers around one million – it has done for well over four years now.

‘Hundreds of thousands of young people need wrap-around support, they should be matched and mentored into work so they can find and keep jobs. It is essential that we throw these vulnerable young people a lifeline.

‘This should be combined with a National Insurance break for employers who take on one of the under-25s and schools should be encouraged to make the most of their alumni; having past pupils helping new school leavers navigate a dicey jobs market.’

Recovery: For all adults aged 16 and over the unemployment rate has fallen sharply to a four-year low of 7.6 per cent

Mr Osborne and his team have been briefed on the plan by Tory MP Brooks Newmark, who urged the Chancellor to announce the policy on December 5.

‘While our growth prospects are looking better and better, it is important we pay special attention to our young people,’ Mr Newmark told The Sun.

A senior Treasury source added: 'George will do something to keep on tackling youth unemployment in the Autumn Statement. He recognises this is an important priority.'

Simon Walker, director deneral of the Institute of Directors, said: 'It is absolutely right that the Chancellor should be considering ways of tackling the UK’s unacceptably high level of youth unemployment.

'National Insurance increases the cost of employing people. Businesses would be more likely to take on extra staff if they had to pay less tax to do so. This also applies to jobseekers over 25.'
