Al-Shahani striker Shami Hassan was left in agony after suffering a brutal double head crack in a game against Al-Sadd.

The 30-year-old was initially knocked down from a challenge by his own goalkeeper, making contact with the top of his head in the process.

Hassan was then left lying flat on the floor, when he received a further blow to the head as an opposition defender's knee collided with the side of his head.

Luckily Hassan was left with no ill effects from the incident on Sunday night, and would have been celebrating come the final whistle.

His side Al-Shahani eventually ran out 3-1 winners, inflicting a first defeat on Al-Saad in the Qatar Stars League this season.
