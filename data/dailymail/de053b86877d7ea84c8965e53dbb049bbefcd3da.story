Gott im Himmel! The country’s most famous war comic has crossed to the other side.

Unthinkable as it may be to generations of readers, Commando For Action And Adventure – better known as Commando comics – has been in the hands of the enemy for a month.

A legion of fans, including British troops in Afghanistan, will be shell-shocked to learn that the comic is being printed in Germany.

Shock: Commando comics, which tell tales of British derring-do in the Second World War, are now being printed in Germany

Popular: The patriotic content of the comics has not stopped them moving outside Britain to be printed

Hugely popular: The publication has been printed in the UK for the last 52 years

But the good news is that ownership of
 the last war comic of its kind in Britain is still firmly in Allied 
hands – at the Dundee headquarters of D C Thomson.

Hugely popular since it first appeared in 1961, the publication has been printed in the UK for the past 52 years.

But the publisher, which is also 
renowned for the Beano and the Dandy, has taken a ‘commercial’ decision 
to place responsibility for printing in the hands of the old enemy. A 
spokesman for the firm said: ‘Commando is still a D C Thomson 
publication.

‘Since the beginning of May, Commando 
has been printed by St Ives Management Services Ltd at the plant of 
their sub-contractor GGP Media, in Germany.’

D C Thomson promised that Commando 
readers will continue to receive ‘the same top-quality product with rich
 illustrations and exciting storylines’.

GGP Media is based in Possneck, 
Thuringia – near where the revolutionary Messerschmitt Me 262 fighter 
jets were being built in an underground weapons factory in the Second 
World War.

But the switch to a new printing plant
 in ‘enemy territory’ is unlikely to diminish the appeal of an iconic 
publication which has entranced generations of schoolboys – and more 
than a few of their fathers.

More than 4,600 editions of Commando 
have been published and  at the peak of its popularity, in  the 1970s, 
it had a circulation  of 750,000.

Today it is available in a digital 
format but ‘hard copies’ of the four comics published every fortnight 
are still read by nearly 10,000 military buffs.

In the early years, all 
of Commando stories were devoted to the Second World War, presenting 
gripping if simplistic tales of grizzled British ‘Tommies’ facing down 
dastardly Germans or cruel, crazed Japanese.

Legendary illustrators such as Gordon 
Livingstone, Ian Kennedy and Ken Barr used a variety of artistic styles 
and a rich colour palette in the 64-page ‘novels’ to portray British and
 Commonwealth soldiers at war.

Plant: But D.C. Thomson, which received a royal visit this month, is not printing Commando in-house

In more recent times, the comic has 
extended its range to include a  variety of conflicts such as Korea, the
 Cold War, the Spanish Civil War and the Falklands conflict.

But the 
most popular war comic of its kind has always stuck to the same 
characteristic motifs of courage, patriotism, noble actions – and making
 a refreshing cup of tea while in the face of danger.

The comics are hugely popular in 
countries such as Finland and Norway, and have been published in several
 languages, including Hindi.

They are also popular with the 
soldiers of today. British troops in Helmand recently asked D C Thomson 
to send them a consignment.
