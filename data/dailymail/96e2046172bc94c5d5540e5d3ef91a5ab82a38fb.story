A couple obsessed with TV series Little House on the Prairie have transformed the living room of their semi-detached home into a log cabin to look like the set from the show.

Peter Szwajgier, 40, and his fiancée Alicja Druzkowska, 38, gave their 1930s home in Irthlingborough, Northamptonshire, a rustic makeover to give them a real taste of the wild frontier.

The couple spent £1,200 on 60 wooden logs which were cut to size and nailed onto the walls of the living room of their £110,000 three-bedroom property.

Looks normal from outside: The couple were inspired to change their home after getting hooked on episodes of the 1970s hit series Little House on the Prairie

Lorry driver Mr Szwajgier said he and Miss Druzkowska were inspired to change their home after getting hooked on episodes of the 1970s hit series Little House on the Prairie.

He said: ‘It’s our own little world and we are very pleased. Our friends who come to see it are impressed with the room but so far nobody has asked me to do one like it for them.

‘In our new room we have a piano and drum kit and when our friends come round we gather around the wood burner to have a quiet drink and a little jam session.’

Mr Szwajgier his fiancée had always wanted to build a log cabin like the one in the show on a plot of land - but the issues of finding space and getting planning permission made this a tricky dream.

So when the couple bought their house last October they decided they could use the extension to create their own version of a log cabin in just one room.

Little House on the Prairie was a US drama series about a family living on a farm in Walnut Grove, Minnesota, in the 1870s and 1880s.

It was adapted from Laura Ingalls Wilder’s best-selling series of Little House books published from 1932 to 1943, and ran for nine series on the NBC network from 1974 to 1983.

The central characters were farmer Charles Ingalls, his wife Caroline and their four daughters, Mary, Laura, Carrie and Grace.

The series followed the children's simple farm upbringing but also tackled issues such as adoption, alcoholism and blindness. 

And Mr Szwajgier added: ‘It’s worked out very well and gives me a real sense of achievement - especially when I look at all the scars on my hand from the cuts I got while I was working on it.’

Miss Druzkowska, a fitness instructor, said: ‘I think we’ve created something which could be quite unique in the UK. I definitely think it will add extra value to the house.

‘It now has an extra room overlooking the garden which is very cosy and relaxing - it’s certainly not your normal living room and is a lot more personal.

‘The neighbours said they couldn’t imagine how it would look when it was finished but some of them have been in to see it and have been really impressed.’

The couple - who have two children, Dominik, 11, and Oliwia, seven - became engaged just over a year ago. 

The logs were delivered from Clifford Jones Timber in Ruthin, north Wales.

Company employee Lesley Taylor-Williamson said: ‘This was one of the more unusual orders we have received but we are used to supplying a variety of different customers.

‘We send fence posts to the Falkland Islands, lampposts to Center Parcs and special logs to a chain of pizza shops but this was definitely a first.'
