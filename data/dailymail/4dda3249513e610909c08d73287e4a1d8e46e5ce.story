The number of immigrants to the UK has risen three-fold in 30 years, a new study showed today.

More people have come to Britain than left every year since 1994, fuelling a rising population.

The Office for National Statistics said the impact is 'felt across the UK economy', with most now moving from other countries in search of work. 

Net migration was at a relatively low level during the 1980s and early 1990s. Since 1994, it has been positive every year and rose sharply after 1997, the ONS said

The main reason for moving to the UK is to find work, followed by studying and joining family already here

The ONS released the new overview of the impact of immigration on Britain's population over the last 30 years.

Immigration in 1980 was 173,000, which rose to 526,000 in 2013, hitting a peak of 596,000 in 2006.

The study examined changes in net migration - the difference between the number of long-term immigrants coming to the UK and the number of emigrants leaving.

In 1980, more people left than arrived, meaning net migration was negative at minus 55,000.

But by 2013, more migrants were arriving than leaving, taking this figure up to 209,000.

'Over the last 20 years, net migration has been positive - increasing in magnitude in the late 1990s, and following the expansion of the EU during the 2000s,' the ONS said.

'More recently, as the UK economy recovers from the recent economic downturn, net migration has begun to increase once again - with work generally the most common reason for migrating here.

'The impact of migration can be felt across the UK economy and society in the composition of the population and labour force, and also through demand for public services and housing.'

David Cameron pledged at the last election to cut net migration to the levels last seen in the 1990s. In 2011, he said this would happen by 2015, ‘no ifs, no buts’.

But latest figures show 260,000 more people arrived in the UK than left in year to June, including a record 228,000 extra immigrants who arrived from elsewhere in the European Union. 

More immigrants to the UK are born outside the EU, but the number has fallen sharply in recent years

The ONS has published the new overview of the last three decades using previously published data.

The sharp rise in immigration during the 2000s was driven by new countries joining the EU after 2004, including Poland.

While this did show a decrease after the economic downturn in 2008, more recently, net migration of EU citizens has started to increase again, the ONS said.

Net migration of non-EU citizens increased after 1997 and peaked in 2004 but declined sharply in 2005 and saw a further steady decrease between 2010 and 2013.

However, latest estimates show an increase in net migration of non-EU citizens to 168,000 in the year ending June 2014.

The total fertility rate for UK-born mothers is 1.79, compared to 2.17 for women born elsewhere

In 2004 there were 95,000 Poles living in the UK, but by 2013 this had increased to 679,000, an increase of 584,000

Between 2009 and 2012, the most common reason for moving to the UK was to study, but in 2013 it was overtaken by coming for work.

More detailed information shows that women born outside the UK have more children than Britons.

The total fertility rate for UK-born mothers is 1.79, compared to 2.17 for women born elsewhere.

The foreign populaiton of Britain has also changed. While India remains the most reported country of birth, the increase of 232,000 betwen 2004 and 2013 is much lower than other countries.

For example, in 2004 there were 95,000 Poles living in the UK, but by 2013 this had increased to 679,000, an increase of 584,000, making it the second highest reported country of birth for non-UK born residents.
