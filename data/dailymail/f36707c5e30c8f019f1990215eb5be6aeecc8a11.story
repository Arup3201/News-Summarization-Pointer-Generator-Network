Former U.S. Representative
James Traficant of Ohio, a brash, eccentric figure known for his
bombastic speeches who went to prison for corruption, died on
Saturday at age 73, his family attorney said.

Traficant had been hospitalized since Wednesday in critical
condition after he lost control of his 1948 Ford tractor in the
barn at his daughter's home in Greenford, Ohio, police said.

The tractor rolled over and pinned him underneath.

Family attorney Heidi Hanni said Traficant died at 11:30am. 

She did not disclose a cause of death, and the local county
coroner's office said it would make a statement on Sunday.

R.I.P: Former U.S. Rep. James Traficant Jr., who spent seven years in prison on corruption charges, died on Saturday after being critically injured in a tractor accident on Wednesday

The maverick congressman, a former sheriff from the gritty
industrial city of Youngstown, was convicted in 2002 of
racketeering, bribery, obstruction of justice and tax evasion.

The U.S. House of Representatives then voted nearly
unanimously to expel him.

The burly Traficant had cut a singular figure in Congress,
sporting dated bell-bottom pants and a mound of spiky hair,
which was revealed to be a toupee when he went to prison.

He was known for frequent one-minute floor speeches - rants
against free trade, foreign aid, the Internal Revenue Service
and anything else he depicted as beating down his struggling
constituents.

'Beam me up,' he would say, quoting from Star Trek and
asking to be removed from what he saw as Washington absurdities.

A Democrat who often bucked his own party, Traficant managed
to deliver federal money and projects to his district, which
suffered from steel mill closures and high unemployment.

Traficant grew up in eastern Ohio and played quarterback at
the University of Pittsburgh. 

He was drafted, but released, by
the Pittsburgh Steelers professional football team.

He was elected Mahoning County sheriff in 1980 and became
known for refusing to foreclose on out-of-work steelworkers.

While sheriff, Traficant successfully defending himself
against charges of taking payoffs from mobsters to overlook
loan-sharking, prostitution and drug trafficking. 

He convinced
the jury he took the money in a one-man sting operation.

Publicity from that trial was Traficant's springboard to
Congress. He was elected in 1984.

While he was in Congress, a U.S. tax court ruled that he
owed more than $100,000 in back taxes on bribes.

Still, he kept getting elected. Many voters viewed him as a
champion of the regular guy and reveled in his earthy,
in-your-face style.

A judge in 2002 sentenced him to eight years in prison after
he was convicted of making his staff give him a portion of their
paychecks and do chores on his farm and boat, as well as of
taking bribes and favors from businessmen, and for concealing
all this on his tax returns.

Traficant - seen here arriving for his sentencing hearing on bribery, tax evasion and racketeering charges in 2002 - had been in a critical conidtion since the accident on Wednesday

As he faced prison, Youngstown celebrated his folk-hero
status when a local minor league baseball team gave free entry
to fans wearing bad wigs and those who declared themselves to be 'a son of a truck driver', one of his frequent declarations.

Traficant ran for reelection from prison but lost.

He emerged from prison in 2009 and made an unsuccessful
attempt to reclaim his old congressional seat.

He is survived by his wife, Patricia, and two daughters.
