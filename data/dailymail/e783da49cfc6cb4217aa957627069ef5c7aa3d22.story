A 7ft mirror that fell and killed a four-year-old boy at a Hugo Boss store should have been fixed to a changing room wall, a coroner was told yesterday.

Austen Harrison was in the changing room at the Hugo Boss outlet store at Bicester Village, Oxfordshire, on June 4, as his father tried on some clothes.

The boy from Crawley, West Sussex, suffered severe head injuries when the mirror 'collapsed' and was rushed to hospital where he died four days later. 

Austen Harrison, four, was with his father as he tried on some clothes at the Hugo Boss shop when he was hit by the seven feet tall mirror, a coroner has been told

At the inquest hearing in Oxford yesterday, 
Detective Sergeant Chris Whitwell from Thames Valley Police told the 
coroner the investigation had found the mirror should have been fixed to the
wall.

He told the 
hearing at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford: 'It would appear the 
family were shopping in the store and Austen’s father was trying on some
clothing in the store’s changing rooms.

'There was a large mirror up against a wall. It was seven feet tall with two "wings" attached to it.

'At some stage the mirror has collapsed onto Austen, which appears to have led to his death.

'Our initial investigation shows the mirror was supposed to be fixed to the wall - it wasn’t a free-standing mirror.

'It would appear it wasn’t fixed to the wall and at some point became unstable and collapsed onto Austen.'

An off-duty doctor treated the boy after the mirror fell at about 8.40pm until emergency services arrived at the store.

The hearing was told that Austen was taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital for a CT scan on his brain.

Emergency surgery was carried out but Austen died from his devastating injuries.

Police and Environmental Health Officers from Cherwell District Council continue to probe the tragedy.

The brief hearing was opened and adjourned ahead of a full hearing which was likely to be heard next year.

On Tuesday, Austen's parents released a statement through their solicitor.

Mr and Mrs Harrison, whose full names
were not given, said: 'Austen was a bright and vibrant boy who injected
life into everything he touched.

'His energy and creativity will be missed every day by all who met him and by those who did not have the privilege to meet him.'

The family is planning to set up a foundation in Austen's name to help improve the lives of other children, the family added.

Retailer Hugo Boss released a statement on Tuesday about the Austen's death.

It read: 'All of us at 
Hugo Boss remain devastated at the death of Austen Harrison on Saturday 
June 8th after the accident on June 4th.

'It
is a terrible tragedy, we are receiving condolences for the family from
Hugo Boss employees and other people from all over the world who share 
their sympathies.

'We will continue assisting the authorities in any way with an investigation into the accident.'

The Bicester Village also published a statement at the time.

It
said: 'Everyone at Bicester Village is deeply saddened by this tragic 
accident. We send our heartfelt condolences to the family and our 
thoughts and prayers are with them.

'The matter is now under investigation and there is no further comment at this time.'
