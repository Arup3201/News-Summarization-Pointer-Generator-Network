A high-flying wife who 'sacrificed' her career to be a homemaker has won the chance of a bigger slice of her ex-husband's multi-million-pound fortune.

Career woman, Julia Hammans, 55, was once finance director of high-end retailer, Dickins & Jones, but gave up the board room for nappy changing.

She married top accountant, Nicholas Hammans, in 1983, and stayed at home with the children whilst his career flourished. Mrs Hammans said he sometimes earned over £900,000-a-year as a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers and is now worth up to £11 million.

And Mrs Hammans fiercely objected after a family judge ruled in March that an £80,000 income for her was 'generous'.

Although she had £1 million in savings, she said the judge's order would force her to 'downsize' from her £1.75 million West London home.

Now Appeal Court judges have ordered a rehearing of her case, after accepting that she 'arguably' suffered 'discrimination'.

Lord Justice Ryder said it was right that Mrs Hammans should be 'compensated' for the glittering career she had lost.

The court heard the couple, both in their 50s, split in 2004 and their divorce was finalised in August the following year.

Mrs Hammans who appealed  a divorce court order that she must sell her £1.75m six-bedroom home in Twickenham (pictured) to provide herself with an income,  arguing that her multi-millionaire former husband should give her 'compensation' for having 'sacrificed' her career

She was awarded £1.37 million of the marital assets and he received about £1.2 million.

Mr Hammans, 54, also paid his ex maintenance of £90,000-a-year before that was upped by agreement to £150,000 in 2007.

But the court heard he now wants to retire for personal reasons and had asked the family judge to capitalise his wife's entitlement into a one-off lump sum.

In March, Mr Justice Coleridge rejected Mrs Hammans' claim for up to £2.6 million and awarded her just £400,000.

He said that, together with her savings and the £500,000 she could make from downsizing her home, would give her a 'generous' £80,000-a-year income.

At the Appeal Court, Mrs Hammans' lawyers argued that was discriminatory and nowhere near enough to compensate her for the loss of her career.

Allowing her appeal, Lord Justice Ryder said a fresh hearing was needed to ensure a fair distribution of assets between the former couple.

'To do otherwise is to discriminate against the wife because she is not the income earner', he told the court.

Forcing her to downsize from her six-bedroom home, in order to boost her income, was 'arguably discriminatory.' The ex-couple's assets, income and needs had to be analysed in a more 'sophisticated' way to avoid any discrimination against Mrs Hammans, he concluded.

The dispute was sent back to the High Court family division for reconsideration by a different judge.

2014: After Mrs Hammans requests a further £2.6million from her ex-husband, a the family judge at the High Court rules Mr Hammans should pay just £400,000.

He says the £400,000 sum, plus money from the sale of the house and interest on her £1million savings, would produce around £2million - giving her the £80,000-a-year he said she needed to live on.

October 2014: At the Court of Appeal, Mrs Hammans argues she deserves £2.2million, in addition to the £400,000, and should be free to keep her house.

Mrs Hammans' solicitor, divorce partner Simon Preston of Stewarts Law, said following the decision: 'Our client is happy that the courts continue to recognise that she sacrificed her career so her husband could progress with his. '

She feels it is only right and fair that her compensation should reflect that sacrifice.

'Julia hopes her case will encourage other divorcing spouses in similar circumstances to look closely at their own situation and any offers on the table.

'We welcome the judgement of the court and the emphasis on the need for courts dealing with cases of this kind to properly address the question of compensation for spouses who have sacrificed careers for the benefit of their families.'

Although Mr and Mrs Hammans earned similar salaries, it was she who gave up work to care for the children, now aged in their 20s.

She had sacrificed 'a serious professional career' and, although she made a little by working as a counsellor, had a negligible earning capacity after so many years away from the office.

By contrast, Mr Hammans, as the family's sole bread-winner, went on to carve out a career as a tax specialist and one of the most successful men in his profession.

The couple had enjoyed a high standard of living on the husband's 'very big earnings' until they split after 21 years of marriage.

Following the divorce, Mrs Hammans received the Edwardian family home, in Cole Park Road, Twickenham, Middlesex, now worth £1.75 million.

Desperate to stay there, she particularly objected to the judge's view that she should sell it, buy a smaller home and add the capital to her savings pot.

Mr Hammans also lives in a £1m-plus house in Twickenham, as well as enjoying a holiday home in Paris, and the court heard he earned £800,000 last year.

Although the ex-couple's children had 'flown the nest', Mrs Hammans' lawyers insisted she deserves to live a similar 'affluent' lifestyle to her former husband.
