An Lu's parents, together with a few other families, had refused to move to make way for a major construction project in Andi village near the city of Xi'an in western China's Shaanxi province.

Father An He, 32, said: 'Basically, the city boundaries are expanding and they wanted our land to build on.

'We had been warned that things might get heavy if we didn't agree to settle but nobody really thought it would come to something like this.'

Other families had already accepted compensation and moved out.

But the family of Lu and some others felt that it was not enough to find a new home, and were demanding more money or the right to stay where they were.

Their homes were then left uninhabitable after the mob believed to have been hired thugs' that locals claim were paid for by the construction firm stormed their way into the homes.
