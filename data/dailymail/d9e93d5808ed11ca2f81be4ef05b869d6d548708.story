With two goals in five second-half minutes against Motherwell in midweek, Mikael Lustig has taken over John Guidetti’s mantle as the most deadly Swede currently residing at Celtic Park. However, the fit-again defender has his sights set on emulating another well-known compatriot.

As a youngster, Lustig grew up in Umeå in northern Sweden watching Old Firm matches which featured his idol — a certain Henrik Larsson — putting Rangers to the sword. After moving to Parkhead in January 2012, however, circumstances have dictated he’s had to wait over three frustrating years for his first chance to face the Ibrox side.

After making his first appearance in a Celtic jersey since Aberdeen on November 9, the 28-year-old — who came on at half-time on Wednesday — insists he is more than ready for next weekend’s League Cup semi-final. It is, as he knows from his formative years watching on television, an occasion where heroes can emerge.

‘When I was younger, I watched Scottish league games on television, especially the Old Firm games because of Henrik Larsson and Johan Mjallby,’ recalled Lustig.

‘So I’ve seen them and, of course, it’s a good time to be a hero.

‘I’ve been here three years now and not played in one. But I always knew I wanted to be at Celtic for a long time, so I knew I would play them at some point. I am ready for it!

‘I’ve been to a couple of the games. I sat in the stands at Ibrox and at Celtic Park. I was injured for the home game and I was in the squad at Ibrox (but didn’t make the bench).

‘The occasion was still unlike anything I had experienced. The atmosphere was brilliant. We’ve not had it for a while.’

Lustig insists everyone within the Celtic dressing room is aware of the significance and importance of the upcoming League Cup and Europa League ties against historic foes Rangers and Inter Milan respectively.

But he believes the uninitiated — like Virgil van Dijk, Jason Denayer and Stefan Johansen — won’t truly understand the occasion until they walk into the searing white heat of Hampden Park for the semi-final a week tomorrow.

‘We play for Celtic and everyone here knows how important these games are,’ said Lustig, whose side faces Ross County in Dingwall in a lunchtime Premiership kick-off today.

‘I don’t go out much. After training I go back to my house and spend time with my kids but still I know how important these games are for the fans.

‘But it’s hard to tell someone about these kind of games if they have not experienced it yet.

‘I always remember hearing that the Champions League nights at Celtic Park were unbelievable. But then when you actually experience it, I remember being like “woah!”.

‘I think you need to experience it for yourself. If you love football you should be watching an Old Firm match.

‘When we drew them (Rangers) we were all talking about it. I’m not going to lie. You miss the atmosphere. Of course it is a big game. But it’s tight in the league just now and that means we can’t just focus on the cup and the European matches like we did the last two years.

‘Before we could put the league on the side a little bit. But now we need to be focusing on every game and that has been quite good for us, I think.

‘We play Ross County today and as well as needing the three points it’s a chance for players to play their way into the Rangers match.’

Lustig’s two second-half goals were headers but he was left ruing ‘blowing’ his big chance to grab a hat-trick in the 4-0 rout of Motherwell. He does not expect to be adding to his tally in Dingwall today or rivalling Leigh Griffiths, Anthony Stokes, Stefan Scepovic and Guidetti at the end of the season.

‘They were my first goals in years so I’d be quite stupid to start boasting about it,’ he smiled.

‘Of course, it’s not every day you score two goals. And one of them was probably the best goal I have ever scored with my head. But maybe not my best-ever goal, because I got some decent ones at Rosenborg.

‘But, let’s be honest, I don’t think I’ll be up there at the end of the season.

‘I actually had a chance to get a perfect hat-trick. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity. But I blew it! I have maybe scored a hat-trick when I was really young. I used to play up front when I was a boy but never in senior football.

‘Is there a goal of the season competition developing between our full-backs? Absolutely, although I don’t think Emilio (Izaguirre) is in the competition yet. But Adam Mathews’ against Hamilton was really good, a screamer.

‘It’s good playing in this Celtic team because that’s three games in a row now the full-backs have scored goals. I don’t think we are going to score in every game. But it is always nice to feel like you have the opportunity to go forward.’
