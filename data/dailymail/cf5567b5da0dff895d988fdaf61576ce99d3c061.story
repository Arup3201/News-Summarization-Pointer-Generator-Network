Comedian Bill Maher hosted a 'Real Time' show on HBO on Friday that's one for the big book. He spoke of the story of Noah's Ark and called the biblical God a 'psychotic mass murderer' who also 'drowns babies.'

Maher explains that he dislikes the story of Noah's Ark because of it's 'implausibility' and its 'immorality'.

The controversial late night comedian points out that the story is about a man who at 900 years old decides to take two animals of every kind in the world, who conveniently happen to live within 5 miles of each other and load them onto a giant ship to save them from God as he destroys the world so that it may start anew.

Bill Maher spoke about the story of Noah's Ark on HBO on Friday night and said that in the story God is depicted as a 'psychotic mass murderer who drowns babies'

Maher also jokes that if God is in a movie with Russell Crowe (pictured) and he's the one with anger issues then there must be a problem

'But the thing that’s really disturbing about Noah isn’t the silly, it’s that it’s immoral. It’s about a psychotic mass murderer who gets away with it, and his name is God,' he said of the nature of the story and its primary character.

'What kind of tyrant punishes everyone just to get back at the few he's mad at? I mean, besides Chris Christie,' he added.

Maher then proceeded to talk about director Darren Aronofsky's film version of Noah starring Russell Crowe.

'Hey, God, you know you're kind of a dick when you're in a movie with Russell Crowe and you're the one with anger issues,' quipped Maher.

Maher likened God's behavior in Noah to Chris Christie's behavior because they both 'punish everyone to get back at the few their mad at'

He did however jokingly laud the movie for managing to offend Christians for 'not making the story biblically accurate enough' and offending the Jews because 'the studio will lose money.'

He then went on to say that the real problem with conservatives and religious zealots are the voluntary restrictions they place on themselves, reports the Huffington Post.

'I'm reminded as we've just started Lent, that conservatives are always complaining about too much restraining regulation and how they love freedom, but they're the religious ones who voluntarily invent restrictions for themselves,' he said.

'On a hot summer day, Orthodox Jews wear black wool, on a cold winter night Mormons can't drink a hot chocolate... isn't life hard enough without making shit up out of thin air to f*** with yourself?'
