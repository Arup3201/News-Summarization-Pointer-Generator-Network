Mockery: Deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman, pictured at last week's Labour party conference, was accused of 'sneering' after she criticised David Cameron's plans to give married couples a tax break

Labour and the Liberal Democrats were accused of ‘sneering’ at marriage yesterday as David  Cameron said he would like to go further in restoring recognition for the institution in the tax system.

Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls led  criticism of the Prime Minister’s plans for a £1,000 transferable tax allowance for married couples, and the Lib Dems also condemned it – opening up a key general election battleground.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, a champion of marriage, said: ‘I’m not sure why Labour are behaving as though this is a big surprise. The Prime Minister has always been very clear that this was a manifesto pledge and he would deliver it.

‘It strikes me that Labour are just using this as an opportunity to sneer at marriage. This is a popular policy that will help eight million hard-working people.’

The Prime Minister said he was ‘proud’ of the measure, which was revealed exclusively by the Daily Mail on Saturday, and would go further if re-elected with a Tory majority.

Married people who earn under the £10,000 income tax threshold will be able to transfer £1,000 of their allowance to a higher-earning spouse, reducing their annual tax bill by £200 from April 2015.

Couples where one spouse is a higher rate taxpayer – earning more than £42,285 in 2015 – will not be able to use the scheme.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, in the crowd at the Labour party conference in Brighton, said women would 'lose out' under the new proposals

‘We are going to deliver,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘It has taken longer than I would like because obviously we have been battling with all the economic problems in front of us –and we’ve been in a coalition – but nonetheless we will in the next Finance Bill be legislating for recognising marriage in the tax system.

‘Obviously I’d like to do more  but I think it is right to start with  people on relatively low earnings.’  But Mr Balls said women ‘lose out’, adding: ‘It’s insulting that £3.85 a week would persuade anyone to get married. And the money will be paid mainly to men not women.’

Miss Harman said on Twitter: ‘Married man’s tax allowance will go to a man on his third wife but not to first two wives looking after his children.’

Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Treasury 
spokesman, said Mr Cameron was ‘so out of touch he thinks people will 
get married for £3.85 a week’.

Labour’s
home affairs spokesman Yvette Cooper said: ‘Sadly it’s clear that for 
this Prime Minister most people’s love and commitment doesn’t count.’

Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Stephen Williams added: ‘You don’t build a fairer society by using the tax system to favour one type of family over another.’ Conservative Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt insisted it was right to recognise marriage. He said: ‘It is an institution that is the building block of our society . . . this is a measure that’s going to help four million hard-working couples.’

Dr Samantha Callan, of the think tank Centre for Social Justice, which has campaigned for such a move, said: ‘We’ve been calling for this since 2007. Half of all children born today will not still be with both their parents by the time they’re 15 and marriage is a more durable relationship.’

Tim Yeo, Conservative MP for South Suffolk, was a rare voice of criticism in his party.

He said he regretted that the proposal ‘may exclude’ men or women on low incomes who have been widowed.

Regrets: A new book has has revealed that David Cameron told an ally he wished he had scrapped the law

David Cameron admitted yesterday he had not foreseen the furore surrounding gay marriage legislation but did not regret pushing it through Parliament.

A new book on the Coalition, published today, claims the Prime Minister confided to an ally that he wished he had ditched the law as it caused such bad feeling with grassroots Conservatives and backbench MPs.

The Prime Minister reportedly said: ‘If I’d known what it was going to be like, I wouldn’t have done it.’ When gay marriage came to a vote in the Commons earlier this year, which Mr Cameron had vocally championed, more than half of Tory MPs refused to back him, meaning the PM needed Labour and Lib Dem support to get the legislation passed.

Tory MPs claim that many party members tore up their membership cards in protest.

The book, In It Together by Matthew D’Ancona, reveals: ‘In his bleaker private moments, Cameron was becoming savagely self-critical about his misreading of the party on gay marriage. “This is down to me,” he told one ally. But he was stuck with the measure now.’

In an interview with the BBC yesterday,  Mr Cameron denied he had made the comment. He said: ‘I don’t regret it and Britain is a more equal and fairer country for having done it. I’m passionate about marriage. I think it’s a great institution and I think it should be available to people who are gay as well as to those of us who aren’t.’

But he added: ‘I don’t think I expected quite the furore there was. It’s clearly been very difficult for some people to take on.’

Under the legislation, the Church of England was exempted from conducting gay weddings and other religious groups are allowed to refuse to do so.

But Mr Cameron admitted that opponents of same-sex unions gained backing because he failed to explain that religious groups would not be forced to conduct gay marriage ceremonies against their will.

‘I’m not sure we got across to people that this was about marriages that could take place in register offices – this was not going to change what happened in church, mosque or synagogue,’ he said. ‘I’m not sure we got that point across.’
