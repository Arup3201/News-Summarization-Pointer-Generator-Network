A military-style school staffed entirely by ex-servicemen is set to open for  deprived children in response to the riots, it has been revealed.  

Leading military personnel, including the captain of an elite Afghan  counter-insurgency unit and former Chief of Defence Staff, are establishing a revolutionary 'free school', called the Phoenix.   

Housed in Territorial Army barracks in Oldham, it will have a zero tolerance approach to bad behaviour and will foster academic and sporting competitiveness.

Its founders have said they will 'rip-up' the national curriculum and pupils starting the school, aged 11, will be taught nothing but literacy and numeracy until they have reached minimum standards in both disciplines.  

High moral standards will be instilled and its teachers will seek to ensure  pupils do not leave the school with 'an inflated sense of self-worth'.  

And 'all liberal shibboleth' (jargon) taught at teacher training will be jettisoned. 

The announcement came as England's first 'free' schools  - the Aldborough E-Act Free School, in East London, and Krishna-Avanti primary, in Leicester, opened their doors to pupils.  

Free Schools, a flagship Coalition policy and a cornerstone of David Cameron's Big Society ethos, are semi-independent state schools set up by parents, teachers, faith groups and other organisations.

Aldborough, a primary with 25 per cent of its 120 places still available, is to have a shortened four-week summer holiday and extended opening hours – from 8am  to 6pm - to cater for working parents.  

It will follow the national curriculum  and focus on academic rigour.

The Krishna-Avanti primary school will give pupils a Hindu faith-based education, with daily prayers, a vegetarian diet, and the chance for pupils to  take part in yoga, meditation and the arts.

However, its head teacher is a devout Christian and half of the pupils it will admit can come from any faith.  

The schools are the first of 24 to open this September and will be followed by dozens more next year.

The Phoenix school is still at pre-proposal stage and would not open until September 2012, at the earliest.  

If approved, it is likely to be based in a gothic building, old Drill Hall - MoD premises in Oldham which house a disused TA training ground. The training ground was gutted by a fire this April.  

The school model is the idea of British Captain Burki, of the counter-insurgency unit at Warminster, who was educated at Manchester Hulme Grammar School.  

Captain Burki is set to retire this year to set-up the school and hopes to roll-out the model across the UK.  

He is developing the model with Tom Burkard of think-tank the Centre for Policy Studies and Lord Guthrie, former Chief of Defence Staff.

As well as scrapping the curriculum Captain Burki will scrap all soft, trendy, 'liberal' teacher training techniques. 

He said in a report: 'The performance of our armed forces in Afghanistan and elsewhere stands out in stark contrast to the mobs that have recently been roaming our streets.  

'As important as role models are, they are only part of the picture. Every liberal shibboleth taught in teacher-training courses will be discarded in favour of proven methods.

'Pupils will not be expected to 'direct their own learning' - most undergraduates are barely capable of this, and it is folly to expect illiterate and innumerate pupils to do the same.

'Rather, teachers should provide the moral and intellectual guidance that all children want and need.'

Captain Burki will also place a strong emphasis on sport and outdoor activities to overcome the problem of attention deficit disorder.  

The school will have a standard admissions policy, recruiting pupils from its catchment area, and students will be encouraged to take rigorous subjects that are needed for entry to elite universities.  

Harrow educated Lord Guthrie, who was the Chief of Defence Staff between 1997 and 2001, said: 'In my experience, those from the toughest  and roughest backgrounds often respond most enthusiastically to the disciplines expected by our armed services.

'So I suspect that the qualities needed by the modern soldier are innate virtues, one which can be drawn out from all of us.  

'But it is clear that too many of our schools are failing to do just that….The  aim is to produce good citizens, not good soldiers.'
