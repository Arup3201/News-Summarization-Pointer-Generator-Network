A hapless taxi driver had to be rescued after plunging his car into a canal while waiting for a fare outside a restaurant.

Emergency services were called to Castro's Restaurant in Chedderton, Staffordshire at 10.30pm on Friday night after reports of a vehicle in the water.

When they arrived they found a Toyota Avensis almost completely submerged in the Caldon Canal after it somehow managed to land in the middle of the four foot deep water.

The taxi somehow ended up in the middle of the Caldon Canal in Chedderton, Staffordshire while the driver was waiting for a fare 

When emergency services arrived at the scene they found the Toyota Avensis almost completely submerged 

Restaurant owner Jamie Bateman, 38, said police, paramedics and firefighters all turned up at the scene after the car ended up submerged.

Mr Bateman, who has run the restaurant for 11 years said: 'I was in the kitchen at about half 10 when some of the staff came in and told me there was a car in the canal.

'A local man got into the water and got the driver out before the emergency services arrived and we took him into the office for a cup of tea while he was getting dry.

'I've never seen anything like it before, there were flashing lights everywhere like some kind of terrorist attack. There were emergency services everywhere.

'It was dark on Friday but I just don't know how the taxi driver managed to do it. It was like something from the Dukes of Hazzard or a Carry On Film.

'You would think he would have dropped in from the edge but he must have taken off as he was right in the middle of the canal.

A local man jumped into the water to rescue the driver before a lorry came and lifted the taxi from the canal 

'Everyone came out to take photographs of what was happening, even other taxi drivers. It was quite amusing really and we're glad the driver is OK.

'He was obviously a little shaken but he wasn't injured.'

Police, firefighters and ambulance crews attended the scene and spent more than two hours removing the car from the water which was from Roseville Taxis, based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire.

A spokesman from Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'Two pumps from Leek and a pump from Newcastle were called to Cheadle Lane, in Cheddleton, at about 10.40pm on Friday, November 21.

'Firefighters prepared themselves with wetsuits but the driver of the car was already out of the vehicle on arrival.

'The man was receiving treatment from the ambulance service. Crews left the scene at just after 11pm.'
