Former Brazil international Alex De Souza had his name sprayed onto the field of play during his testimonial by none other than the referee.

Alex celebrated the end of his career by playing alongside a host of his footballing friends in his Palmeiras' testimonial.

During the match as the ex-Fenerbahce ace was about to take a free-kick, the referee used his vanishing spray to write out the word 'Alex' in tribute to the 37-year-old.

Alex found the referee's gesture amusing during his testimonial match in Brazil on Saturday 

Alex, who played 48 games for Brazil, spent the majority of his career in his homeland before moving to Italian outfit Parma in 2002.

His most successful spell in Europe came in Turkey with Fenerbahce where the attacking midfielder scored an impressive 136 goals in 245 games.

Alex decided to hang his boots up in December after spending 19 years in the professional game.
