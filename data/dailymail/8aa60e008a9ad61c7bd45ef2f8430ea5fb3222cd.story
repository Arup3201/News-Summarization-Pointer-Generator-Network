Online shoppers have hit out after it emerged British users of Amazon Prime pay up to £60 more a year for the service compared to those in other European countries.

Customers using the website are encouraged to take a 30-day trial of the service - which entitles them to free one-day delivery and free movies and ebooks - before they pay £79-a-year to continue.

But subscription service costs just £7.50-a-year in Italy, £11-a-year in Spain, £36 in Germany and France and £41 in Canada. In the US, the service costs £65 annually.

Amazon's Prime service - which offers three delivery and other benefits - is much cheaper in other countries

Amazon has defended itself, saying that not all customers are offered the same premium services as UK subscribers.

For example, customers in Spain and Italy, where the service is cheapest, are only offered free delivery within 2-3 working days.

In France subscribers get free one-day shipping and the ability to store photos in the Amazon cloud, and in Germany customers get photo storage, movie streaming, free one day delivery, and the ability to borrow Kindle books.

But it will still come as bad news for UK customers looking to save on their monthly subscription, as the cheaper reduced services are not available in this country. 

The disparity between countries emerged on the day the company announced quarterly profits of £393million

The disparity - which came to light on the same day the firm announced fourth quarter profits of £393million - has angered shoppers.

Marc Gander, of Consumer Action Group, told MailOnline: 'This is not the first time British consumers have faced higher prices than those elsewhere.

'I don't know if companies think that because we've got a bit of an economic recovery going they want some of it too, but I still think British consumers are feeling the pinch.

'These companies seem to pay very little tax in the UK, whilst plundering the pockets of British people.'

The number of people using the Amazon Prime service rose by more than 50% last year, with three million Britons now signed up.

The premium service offers unlimited free one-day delivery on more than seven million items and access to 500,000 Kindle books to borrow.

Last year, the cost of Prime jumped by £30 a year when the internet giant added its video streaming service, Amazon Prime Video, to the package.

Amazon's UK subsidiary paid just £2.4million in corporate taxes in the year up to April 2013, despite making sales of £4.3billion.

It emerged earlier this month that the firm could be forced to hand over billions in unpaid taxes after the deal it struck with Luxembourg in 2003 was deemed illegal.

Defending the price disparity between countries, a spokesman for Amazon said: 'Amazon Prime is a unique service, and whilst different countries are subject to different operating costs, it represents great value for our customers in every country in which it’s available.'

The Italian service only offers two to three day delivery and fewer advantages and the French service also does not offer free movies.
