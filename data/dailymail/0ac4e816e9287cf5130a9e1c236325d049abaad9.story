From getting lost on the Metro to badly chipping his tooth on a baguette to making miraculous mid-match recoveries from injury — strange things tend to happen to Andy Murray at the French Open.

Nothing, however, could top the tale of the unexpected that would be reaching the final at the expense of Rafael Nadal, the man who has only ever lost one best-of-five-set match on clay out of 89 played.

Without a head coach and largely scratching around for form prior to the event, Murray must defeat not only the eight-time champion, but also the opponent who has proved the most formidable obstacle to his ambitions at Grand Slams.

All set: Andy Murray plays a volley as he takes part in a practice session at Roland Garros on Thursday

Murray’s finest career achievements have come when the Spaniard has been out of the way, either through being absent with injury (the 2012 US Open and Olympics) or Wimbledon last year, when Nadal was upset in the first round.

Ahead of Friday's semi-final, Wimbledon champion Murray was honest enough to admit: ‘I’d rather it was someone else than Rafa, but it’s a great opportunity for me to go out there and play a great match and see if I can beat him.’

There had been plenty of drama even prior to Wednesday night’s extraordinary late win over Gael  Monfils, with the marathon against Philipp Kohlschreiber and beating Fernando Verdasco despite letting slip 15 break points.

That, coincidentally, was the number that he had when he met Nadal in the semi-finals here three years ago in going down in straight sets. It showed that he is easily capable of creating opportunities against the greatest ever clay court player.

Murray did so again three weeks ago when he led the Spaniard 4-2 in the decider of the Italian Open quarter-final: ‘I didn’t win but maybe if I had won a few more matches in the build-up it could have helped,’ he said. ‘I’m in a good position right now. I would have signed up for this.

‘The hunger is there. I believe 100 per cent I can beat Rafa and Novak (Djokovic), but on this  surface it’s harder for me than other courts because it’s not my best and they are two of the  greatest clay-court players.

‘It was hard for the two or three months after Wimbledon. As soon as I had the surgery and made that decision, motivation wasn’t an issue for these events. I had no days off for three months getting ready for the Australian Open. I didn’t need to do that.

‘A lot of players have surgery and take three or four weeks off but I trained every single day to get ready to get myself in shape and I am seeing the benefits of doing that now.’

Murray needs a big win against one of his main rivals — he has not beaten a top-10 player since  Wimbledon and only Jo-Wilfried Tsonga from the top 20 — to authenticate the claim that he is properly back.

As John McEnroe said on Thursday: ‘Playing Nadal in the semis — it’s “Now let’s see how far he is going to go here”.’

Far from Ivan Lendl’s absence being a handicap, it is starting to look an advantage in some ways with Murray taking responsibility for himself in a sport which always boils down to self-reliance.

His success of the past 10 days makes it far less likely that he  will bring a new coach in before Wimbledon.

Murray and Nadal have the closest thing to a genuine friendship between the established stars of the men’s game, but theirs is also the most statistically one-sided rivalry with the Spaniard ahead 14-5. History suggests it is difficult to see that improving in the Scot’s favour on Friday.

Ernests Gulbis plays Djokovic, making the tournament’s special guest appearance among the ‘Big Four’ in the semi-finals, and he has earned it.

It helps that the 18th seed cares little for reputations, and his frank discourse on life and tennis after every match leaven the stolid fare generally served up by his peers.

What will serve him best on Friday is his outstanding backhand among other things, and if Djokovic slips up in any way then the colourful Latvian is the kind of free spirit who will happily take advantage.
