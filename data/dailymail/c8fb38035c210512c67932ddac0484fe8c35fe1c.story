The FEI has reacted to the Al Reef Cup scandal and removed the two remaining international endurance events due to be held in the United Arab Emirates from the calendar following a string of serious issues  during races in the region.

Three horses were reported dead at the 74-mile Al Reef Cup in Abu Dhabi on February 1 and one, Splitters Creek Bundy, appeared to have broken both front legs. 

The decision to cancel the March events, according to the governing body, is 'an emergency measure to protect horse welfare and to preserve the integrity of the FEI rules and regulations at FEI events.'

It was at the Al Reef Cup that Splitters Creek Bundy's front legs appeared to collapse beneath him

'The move follows a mandate from the FEI bureau to the executive board to urgently investigate horse welfare issues and non-compliance with FEI rules and regulations in the UAE,' a spokesman said.

The board is now due to finalise its recommendations to the bureau.

'We have made this our top priority and will make our conclusions as speedily as possible so that the recommendations can be presented to the bureau for urgent consideration,' FEI president Ingmar De Vos said.

The FEI had initially said the Abu Dhabi event was outside its jurisdiction as it was covered by officials from the UAE.

The international races in March were scheduled at Bou Thib, Abu Dhabi and the Crown Prince Cup in Dubai. 

The FEI are also set to look into the practice of duct-taping over blinkers so that the horse can hardly see. The reason for taping the blinkers is unclear although as it stands, this is not against the rules.

In the clip below, also from the Al Reef Cup, a horse with blinkers taped can be see crashing into a gate.
