Gulfstream has announced the arrival of two new business jets to its fleet, the G500 and G600, said to cost £27m and £33m, respectively.

The planes were unveiled before a crowd of 3,000 in Savannah, Georgia on Tuesday by Gulfstream president Larry Flynn.

Both jets boast 100 per cent fresh air, room for up to 19 passengers in an extra wide cabin, and a touchscreen flight deck.

Sky high: Gulfstream has unveiled two new business jets, the G500 and G600, said to cost £27 million and £33 million respectively

Comfort first: The planes have room for  19 passengers in extra wide cabins which boast 100% fresh air replenished every two minutes

They should also cut the average fly time by an hour, with the company promising to save current Gulfstream passengers up to a week in travel time.

The G500 has three living areas and the G600 has four, as well as an optional crew rest area, and forward and aft lavatories.

The planes will have the lowest cabin altitude in history, with passengers feeling as though they are standing on terra firma at 4,850 feet, when flying at 51,000 feet.

Cutting edge: The cockpit features a touchscreen flight deck and active control sidesticks

The air is also the cleanest, being replenished with 100 per cent fresh air every two minutes. Quiet cabins and extra large windows to flood the space with natural light are also promised.

The G500 and G600 fly at a maximum operating speed of Mach 0.925,  powered by Pratt & Whitney PW800  engines - the first time a Gulfstream has not used Rolls Royce engines.

The high-speed cruise of Mach 0.90, will save up to an hour per flight.

Launch: Gulfstream unveiled the G500 to the crowd at its Savannah, Georgia facility on Tuesday

The cockpit features cutting-edge technology, with  integrated touchscreen controllers, active control sidesticks, and a next-generation enhanced vision system.

'This is another extraordinary day in the storied history of Gulfstream,' said Gulfstream president Flynn.

'The G500 and G600 are tremendous additions to our family of aircraft, filling a niche in an already extensive product line. 

Schedule: The first flight of the G500 is set for 2015

'In 2008, we introduced two game-changers in business aviation, the G650 and G280. Now, six years later, we’re introducing another pair of revolutionary aircraft, the G500 and G600.'

The first flight of the G500 is scheduled for next year. Gulfstream projects it will receive type certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration and European Aviation Safety Agency in 2017 and begin deliveries in 2018.

The G600 flight-test program is expected to begin approximately 12 to 18 months after the G500’s, and entry-into-service is projected to be in 2019.
