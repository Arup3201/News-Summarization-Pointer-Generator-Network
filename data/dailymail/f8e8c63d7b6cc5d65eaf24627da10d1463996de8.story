Ariel Sharon, the Israeli general and former prime minister who proved such a controversial figure across the Middle East for more than five decades, died yesterday.

He was 85.

Nicknamed The Bulldozer for his tenacious approach to war and politics, Sharon suffered a serious stroke in 2006 and remained in a coma until his death.

Many Israelis will mourn one of their 
nation's founding fathers, who fought in all their wars and held almost 
every top political post.

But millions more will remember him as the Butcher of Beirut, infamously allowing the slaughter of refugees in Lebanon.

Perhaps the only point of agreement is that he was one of the central characters in the turbulent drama of the Middle East.

Ariel
 Sharon was born in 1928 to middle-class parents who had emigrated from 
Russia, and he grew up near Tel Aviv.

He joined the underground Jewish 
army aged 14.

Six years later, he fought in the 1948 war of 
independence, where he was wounded, then made his name in the new 
Israeli Defence Forces.

David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founding prime 
minister, admired Sharon and asked him to establish an elite commando 
unit.

Within months, Unit 101 had earned Israel its first condemnation 
by the United Nations after a raid on a Jordanian town that left 69 
people dead.

But Sharon recovered from the furore and went on to play
 key roles in Israel's subsequent wars.

In the 1973 Yom Kippur War, he 
defied orders to take 5,000 men through Egyptian lines, a daring move 
that changed the course of the conflict and cemented his heroic status 
among Israelis.

Upon entering politics, Sharon was renowned as a hawk, 
supporting the creation of Jewish settlements in occupied territories.

In
 1982, came the moment that made him such a hate figure across the Arab 
world when, as defence minister, he ordered Israeli troops into Lebanon.

It ended with them besieging Beirut and standing by as Lebanese militia
 massacred thousands in refugee camps.

Sharon denied responsibility, but
 he was sacked as defence minister and condemned by an inquiry.

Unexpectedly,
 he bounced back to become leader of the right-wing party Likud, and was
 elected premier in 2001 on a promise of peace and security after his 
provocative visit to a Jerusalem mosque helped spark a Palestinian 
uprising.

1928 - born in British Palestine

1942 - signs up to Gadna youth battalion

1956 - brigade commander in 1956 Suez War

1969 - made head of IDF's Southern Command

1973 - turns tide of Middle East War

1973 - joins centre-right Likud party

1981 - becomes Minister of Defense

1982 - directs Lebanon War

1998 - becomes Minister of Foreign Affairs

2001 - becomes 11th prime minister

2006 - suffers a severe stroke

Yet suddenly - worried by Arab population growth and 
American political weakness - this 20st tough-guy started talking about 
the inevitability of a Palestinian state.

He formed a centrist party 
and set about dismantling Jewish settlements, earning the enmity of his 
most fervent supporters.

Who knows what he might have achieved had he 
not been struck down by successive strokes on the brink of winning a 
crucial election?

For, as so often in history, who better to make 
peace than a hardliner forged in war?

Instead came eight years of 
fighting death with the same fierce determination that he showed 
throughout his life.

'The first Israeli leader who stopped claiming Israel had a right to all of the Palestinians' land.' - Palestinian commentator Ghazi al-Saadi, when Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip.

'The job of prime minister... changed him, not just ideologically but also in terms of his personality. He was a fighting, quarrelsome man and suddenly he imposed on himself a great deal of restraint, personal control and calm.' - Yossi Sarid, leader of Israel's Meretz Party.

'It is impossible to justify the minister of defence's disregard of the danger of a massacre.' - Israeli commission that found Sharon, defence minister at the time, indirectly responsible for a massacre

'It was a stigmatisation I rejected utterly.' - Sharon in his autobiography, expressing outrage at commission's findings.

'Everyone there should move, should run, should grab more hills, expand the territory. Everything that's grabbed will be in our hands, everything that we don't grab will be in their hands.' - Sharon, as foreign minister in 1998, calling on Jewish settlers to take over as much West Bank land as possible

'If in a few months the Palestinians still continue to disregard their part in implementing the road map, then Israel will initiate the unilateral security step of disengagement from the Palestinians.' - Sharon, in a December 18, 2003, speech as prime minister, outlining plan to separate Israelis and Palestinians to stop attacks and to give up settlements in Gaza and parts of West Bank.

'He leaves behind great political chaos of the kind that I don't remember in the history of the country of Israel.' - Sharon biographer Uzi Benziman commenting on plan to withdraw from Gaza Strip.

'He was one of a kind. I don't know any other man like him.' - the late Joseph Lapid, head of Shinui Party

'He never thought he would bring final peace, but he certainly thought he would take the steps that would eventually lead to it.' - Arnon Perlman, Sharon adviser until 2004.
