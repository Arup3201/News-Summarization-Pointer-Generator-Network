New York is the United States' snobbiest city, reveals a new study, beating Miami into second place. 

The Big Apple was found to be the one place where people hold their head (and noses) up that little bit higher according to result of a questionnaire about America's Favourite Places by Travel and Leisure.

But is it snobbery, or pride? And could 'confidence' somehow be misconstrued as snobbery? New York City topped the pile for snobbery; other categories included wine bars, museums, and cleanliness, in which voters evaluated 38 major metropolitan areas.

New York, with its luxurious feel, was top of the list of the US's snobbiest cities

Showbiz capital Los Angeles is an unsurprising third on the list, but Washington DC lands fourth place not just due to its thousands of high-powered political types but its trendy art  scene.

One NYC photographer believes the home of the White House should have toppled his home town. on the snobbery table.

 Travis Levius told Travel and Leisure said: 'In DC, it’s all about what you do. You can be among New York City's elite if you're an artist, but in DC, that might get you, at best, a look of ‘bless your little heart.'

Here we take a look at the top 10 snobbiest cities, and explore some of the attractions that might make residents feel that little bit better about themselves.

1 New York City

The art scene, shopping and luxury are all too evident in New York. And many residents are certainly 'at the top of their game'. But the question is, why not show it? 

The bright lights of New York City; there are more billionaires here than any other city in the world

It ranks as the least affordable city in the US, so this could also point towards why people ranked it as the country's snobbiest city.

Interestingly, New York is the number one city in the world when it comes to billionaire residents.

2 Miami

The well-sought after winner of America's 'Best Looking' category, it's little wonder these Floridians are confident with themselves.

The cocktail bars in and around Miami Beach are where you will find residents keeping well within their style, and Browns Hotel's Steak House is listed by the magazine as highly respected.

The Cuba Ocho Art & Research Center, an art gallery, offers live music, mojitos, and cigars for a memorable experience.

Miami was named as the city with the best looking people and the second most snobby

LA, with its red carpet and all can either make you, or break you

3 Los Angeles

It's perhaps surprising that LA was only in third spot in the snobby table, with its Hollywood red carpet set and all.

Upscale department stores of West Hollywood's Robertson Avenue can either make you feel a million dollars, or like a pathetic pauper who wished you had a million dollars.

The Ivy restaurant is the place to visit if you feel you fit in more with celebrities. 

But the city did rank in the top 10 for it's more everyman style of diners, burger stores and bakeries.

4 Washington DC

Home to the only Leonardo da Vinci painting in the US the National Gallery of Art is one of the main reasons to be proud in DC.

As the capital, you would expect pride (does it border on snobbery?) to be at the forefront of residents here. 

With the Congress, the President and the Supreme Court all residing here, there's plenty to shout about.

But attractions such as the Kennedy Center's Millennium Stage, which offers free daily musical performances, is a reminder that DC still has an egalitarian side.

5 Boston

The Harvard Book Store and Schoenhof's Foreign Books in Cambridge give this elite University city a real feeling of literacy.

However, despite featuring high up the snobbery list, more annoyance may come with the fact that residents of Boston were discovered to be the worst drivers.  

Hanging in in Kendall Square with quizzers taking on clam pizzas, croissant-crumb-topped mac ’n’cheese, and appropriately named cocktails like the Last Word, made with gin, Chartreuse, and maraschino liquor may help you fit in here.

Washington DC has enough to take pride in, and residents do just that

The Ivy is something rather different in Los Angeles and attracts an upper class crowd

Boston has a solid footing in the university sphere and this is reflected in the city's atmosphere

6 Tampa

Tampa, a newcomer to the survey, made a dramatic entrance by ranking within the top 10 for snobbery, with the city's cleanliness making residents particularly proud. 

Every sophisticated city needs a SoHo, and in Tampa, it’s South of Howard, where people can watch dolphins along Bayshore Boulevard. 

Residents of Tampa are particularly proud of its city's cleanliness

It’s also where you’ll find the Epicurean Hotel, which has a wine shop and a cheeky dessert shop called Chocolate Pi, and faces local institution Bern's Steak House.

7 Dallas

World class museums and theatres, including the Rem Koolhaas-designed Wyly Theatremake Dallas an innovative and popular city to reside in.

The Joule offers something a bit different in Dallas

Dallas has a rich history reflected in its art and museums

Locals are more 'coiffured' than quirky, and this helped Dallas into the top 10 after a few years out of the limelight.

Staying at the Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek, the boutique hotel The Joule or shopping at NorthPark’s Neiman-Marcus have long been hallmarks of good Dallas living.

8 San Francisco

Methodically sourced food, coffee, and wine, means locals have high standards when it comes to dining. 

A rise in technology development in San Francisco has helped create a high standard of living

Technology is also prevalent throughout San Fran - you better make sure you have the latest gadget on your person.

This sees the number of white-collar workers growing, as trade from the Silicon Valley develops.

9 Salt Lake City

The Italian-marble-laden Grand America Hotel and the strollable '15 and 15' neighbourhood, where you’ll find the King's English Bookshop and the Paris Bistro are symbols of a bit of class about Utah.

Salt Lake City was ninth snobbiest - and yet second friendliest

A strange stat is that even though they made ninth in the list of snobbiest cities, they also ranked second in terms of friendliness.

In 2007 Salt Lake City was ranked by as the most vain city in America, based on the number of plastic surgeons per 100,000 and their spending habits on cosmetics.

10 Providence

The city ranked near the top for its notable restaurants such as Federal Hill’s and Downtown’s farm-to-table, from James Beard nominee Ben Sukle. The city also scored well for its gourmet food shops.

Providence, Rhode Island, is proud to be one of America's oldest cities

It's Ivy League affiliation with Brown is another reason for the Rhode Island Capital sneaking into the top ten.

Being one of the oldest cities in the U.S. can also bring with it a spot of pride - as well as it being described as the 'creative capital' and a hive of arts and entertainment.
