Mother Nature is nothing if not unpredictable. By this time last year, she had painted the country in an array of spring colours.

This year, however, experts reckon she’s running two weeks behind – the evidence of which can be seen in these pictures.

The good news is, all that could change this weekend as the sun comes out and temperatures leap into the 60s.

Twelve months ago flowers were already in full bloom, blossom was on the trees and wildlife was coming out of hibernation.

But last month’s bitter cold snap has slowed things down this year. The contrast was noticed at the Royal Horticultural Society’s garden at Wisley, Surrey. 

Last year the ground was already clothed in bright yellow and purple crocuses after a mild winter. This year only a few flowers poke their heads above the ground.

Colin Crosbie, curator at RHS Wisley, said: ‘We think we are probably about two weeks behind where we were last year. It has been a colder winter, the soil has been cooler and it has slowed everything down. But a few days of sunshine is all it could take for it to catch up.’

The Woodland Trust, which monitors the first signs of spring, said wildlife is also emerging slowly this year. Their volunteers have recorded only half the number of ladybirds they saw in March 2014.

The average temperature in England for December, January and February this year was 4.4C – well below last year’s 5.8C. But that could all change in the next few days. Thermometers could nudge past 17C (63F) on Saturday as a tropical mass of air arrives from the Caribbean.

National Trust wildlife specialist Matthew Oates said the slower spring is positive for many species, which need time to hibernate properly before they emerge. If butterflies, and small mammals awake too early, they tend to suffer later if the weather turns cold again.

Meanwhile, England is set to be hotter than Athens, Corfu and Istanbul this weekend as temperatures are expected to soar as high as 16C in a bumper start to spring.

Temperatures are set to increase as the week goes on and eventually peak on Saturday, where parts of the country are forecast to be warmer than many Mediterranean holiday spots.

Much of the country has today seen a bright and sunny day as spring finally arrived, with tomorrow expected to be a dry, but cloudier day, with temperatures rising to 12C. 

The fine weather will continue in the south on Friday, but Scotland will see rain in the west and gale force gusts of up to 60mph in the north west.

The weekend is set to be dry, with bright spells in south and south east England, with temperatures rising to 15C and possibly 16C in sheltered spots, but the rain will continue in western Scotland.

Sunday will be slightly cooler, but another dry day with a good amount of sunny spells. There may be light showers in England and Wales later in the afternoon.

'The temperatures will get warmer as the week goes on,' said Dan Williams, of the Met Office.

'By Saturday we could see temperatures of 14C or 15C and maybe even 16C in a sheltered location in London or the South East.'

The warm weather will coincide with breezes of 20 - 30mph but temperatures will significantly exceed the average 10C for this time of year. 

Meanwhile, the early bursts of spring sunshine and a mild winter have seen this year's first crop of strawberries arrive a week early.

The first homegrown strawberries of 2015 will arrive in supermarkets tomorrow - days ahead of schedule.

Experts say fine weather with good levels of sunshine this week on top of a generally mild winter have helped growers produce the early fruit.

And with temperatures set to reach 16C this weekend, the arrival of the strawberries at Tesco stores is a clear sign that spring is around the corner.

Traditionally, the earliest home grown strawberries come from either Kent, Sussex or Hampshire but this year growers in Wales have won the race to produce the first.

Tesco berry buyer Harriet Turnbull said: 'This is a real coup for Wales which only began growing strawberries on a commercial scale two years ago.

'These berries, grown in the Rhymney Valley, near Cardiff, will put Wales on the UK's strawberry growing map.'

Thanks to milder winters in recent years, Britain on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons

The variety of the Welsh-grown strawberries is called Driscoll's Lusa and has been selected because of its consistent, sweet taste.

Thanks to milder winters recently, Britain on the whole is enjoying longer fruit growing seasons.

The British strawberry season can now last for up to nine months - a whole four months longer than last decade years ago when winters were longer and harsher.

Ms Turnbull added: 'The arrival of the first home grown strawberries brings about a real feel good factor - not only does it herald the start of British summer time but it is also the start of the UK produce growing season.'
