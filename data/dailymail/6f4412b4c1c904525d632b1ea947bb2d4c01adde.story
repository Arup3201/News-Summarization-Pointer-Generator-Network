Mark Skinner, 49, pictured leaving court earlier in the year, spied on four women, a court heard.

A sex-obsessed Army Major who placed a hidden camera in an army barracks toilet escaped jail yesterday.  

Mark Skinner, 49,  had suffered a back problem that prevented him from sleeping with his wife – but his ‘addiction’ led him  spy on four women, a court heard.

His sex addiction led to him setting up a camera in a toilet and also spying on victims as they undressed in their homes.

Bulford Military Court in Wiltshire heard how Skinner filmed four victims between February and August last year, leaving them feeling ‘humiliated’, ‘confused’ and ‘disgusted’.

The six-inch long and two-inch wide camera - similar to a GoPro personal video camera device - was placed on the floor inside the female toilet at the Westdown army barracks near Warminster.

Taking advantage of both his rank and position, he also filmed victims undressing in their homes at the Beachley Barracks near Chepstow, Gloucestershire, the court heard.

Yesterday Jeremy Barton, defending, described Skinner as a ‘sex addict’. 

In his mitigation he said: ‘He was suffering from a number of mental health issues at the time.

‘He was suffering from a sex addiction. He also had back problems and was suffering from not having an active role in the army.

‘He had a desk job rather than being on his feet.

‘His sex life had suffered because of his back and he was unable to have sex with his wife, who is in court today.

‘The way he dealt with it was by visiting adult porn websites and he masturbated more than what is considered the normal amount for a male adult.

‘In relation to the incident itself, it was out of character as he is of exemplary character and that should go towards his credit.

‘This is unlikely to be repeated. The defendant is embarrassed and ashamed.’ 

The court heard how Skinner, a former member of the 1st Battalion of The Rifles, was awarded a Queen’s Jubilee Medal and an Accumulated Service Medal while completing more than 33 years of service.

The married ex-major, from Gloucester, who has no children, joined the Army in 1980 and was discharged on medical grounds on February 2014. 

Lt Cl Will Peters, prosecuting, said: ‘Between August 19 and 29, 2013, a small training exercise took part in the army barracks near Warminster.

‘At about 22.00 hours on August 26, 2013, the victim was using the female toilet.

‘And on the floor next to the toilet she saw what she thought was a camera pointing up from the floor towards the toilet.

‘At the time of seeing it she could not believe her eyes and thought it was an air freshener and left the toilet.

‘She went back to her room and thought about what she had seen and after about ten minutes she went back but the device had gone.’

Judge Advocate Alan Large ordered Skinner to complete the sex offenders’ treatment programme

The court heard how the women went back to the toilet the following evening and the camera was back on the floor next to the toilet.

He added: ‘She picked it up and kept it and reported it to a number of friends who were working on camp. 

‘The video footage was on the camera itself and images were captured of the defendant putting the camera in place.

‘He was in the corridor when the camera was found but he did not accept responsibility.

‘The (memory) card was examined by police and the images of the defendant placing it in the toilet were discovered by officers.

‘He was quickly identified because of what was on the camera and was arrested on August 28.’

After he was arrested he told officers: ‘I did not do this.’

Lt Cl Peters added: ‘He was interviewed on August 29 and gave a pre-planned statement and admitted responsibility for placing the camera in the toilet.’

Another incident happened at the Beachley Barracks near Chepstow, Gloucestershire, where Skinner filmed victims in their homes.

Lt Cl Peters added: ‘Video footage was found which shows the two girls in various states of dress and undress at various times of the day.

‘He was interviewed on March 19, 2014, and he said he could not recall making the videos.’

Victim impact statements were read out by Lt Cll Peters to Bulford Military Court in Wiltshire.

He said: ‘The incident in Westdown barracks made her feel humiliated and exposed.

‘After it happened she found it hard to trust people and felt she was being watched and it changed her perception of people in the military.’

Reading another statement, he added: ‘The invasion of privacy left her feeling confused and disgusted.’

Brigadier Richard Toomey, who worked with Skinner, gave evidence at court and described him as being an ‘amusing’, ‘intelligent’ and someone with great ‘integrity’.

Judge Advocate Alan Large, assisted by a board of three servicemen, ordered Skinner to complete the sex offenders’ treatment programme within three years.

He also ordered him to sign on to the sex offenders’ register for five years.

Judge Large said: ‘The incidents have impacted the lives of the victims because they feel humiliated, confused and disgusted.

‘Had you still been serving in the army, we would have included a dismissal to your sentence.

‘They (your actions) were recorded and there was a degree of planning and there was certainly an abuse of rank and position.’

Skinner admitted four counts of voyeurism at an earlier hearing on November 6 this year.

Two of the charges refer to incidents which took place from February 2013 to August 2013.

Charges three and four took place around August 27, 2013.

But he avoided jail and was instead told to complete the sex offenders’ treatment programme within three years.

He was also ordered to sign on to the sex offenders’ register for five years.

His teary-eyed wife, who had stood by him throughout the hearings, gave him a hug as he was told he would not be going to jail.
