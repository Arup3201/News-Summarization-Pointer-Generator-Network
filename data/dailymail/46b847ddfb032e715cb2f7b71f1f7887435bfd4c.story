Riley Cooper’s tumultuous offseason may be affecting teammates more than previously let on.

Known more for shouting racial slurs at a country music concert than for his on-field performance, the Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Thursday fought an African-American teammate on the practice field.

Mr Cooper and cornerback Cary Williams exchanged words, shoves and slaps before being separated by quarterback Michael Vick.

The scuffle came only weeks after video of Cooper shouting ‘I will jump that fence and fight every n----- here, bro’ after a Kenny Chesney concert went viral.

Footage of the fight shows the two players go at each other immediately after a pass went incomplete in a play during an afternoon practice drill.

It's all good: Mr Cooper insisted that everything was fine and it was normal for two teammates to fight during practice

Both Mr Riley and Mr Williams shove each other before the defender smacks Mr Cooper’s helmet a few times and pulls on the receiver’s facemask before being separated by a coach.

Williams walks away, throwing his helmet to the crowd and then goes back after Cooper while shouting ‘I’m not a n------ you mess with,’ according to the Philadelphia Daily News, before being stopped by Mr Vick.

A coach intervenes and wide receiver DeSean Jackson forces Mr Williams to walk away. 

‘He's just one of those guys, he's a nagging person some times. You get him on the field, he tries to be overaggressive, he tries to do things to intimidate receivers,’ Mr Jackson told the Daily News. ‘It's part of the game we play.’

Though connecting the incident to Cooper’s racist rant over the summer would make sense, both players’ teammates denied to the Daily News that was the case, with Mr Jackson calling it ‘part of what happens out here. It's nothing too serious.’

Cooper also contended the incident was nothing out of the ordinary.

They're competitive: Mr Cooper chalked the fight up to both he and Mr Williams being competitors who want the ball and were trying to make a play -- the fight occurred during practice

‘We're all real close, everybody, Cary included. He's my boy,’ he told the Daily News. ‘We're both in the NFL, we're both super-competitive, we both want the ball… we were just going back and forth, just both being competitors.’

Mr Williams declined to comment to reporters after the practice, but was quoted during training camp last month saying that Mr Cooper might have to redeliver his apology to some teammates, including himself.
