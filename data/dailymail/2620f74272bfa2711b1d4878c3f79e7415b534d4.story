The nine-year-old girl who shaved her head to support her best friend suffering from cancer felt she was being punished when her school said she could not return, she has revealed.

'I was pretty sad that they didn't let me go to school,' Kamryn Renfro said on the Today show on Friday morning. 'I was feeling that I was punished.'

Kamryn, from Grand Junction, Colorado, impressed her family and friends when she asked to shave her head so her best friend, 12-year-old Delaney Clements, wouldn't be the only one without hair.

Delaney lost her hair after undergoing chemotherapy treatments for a childhood cancer known as neuroblastoma and said it made her stand out and feel alone.

'I felt very good inside,' Delaney told Savannah Guthrie. 'I was so happy that I would have somebody there for me and she was 
there for me the whole step of the way and everything.'

So she was stunned when Kamryn's mother emailed the school to let them know what her daughter would look like on Monday morning - and they responded that the new look violated the school's dress code, which bans girls from shaving their heads.

The school told her she could not return to class until she wore a wig or her grew her hair back.

Catherine Norton, chairwoman of the 
board, said the dress code is designed to promote uniformity and a 
non-distracting environment. She said exceptions could only be made in certain 
circumstances.

The families were shocked.

'Friends support each other no matter 
what and this is a brave girl and we should support her and the fact 
that she made that decision,' Wendy Campbell, Delaney's mother, told KUSA.

'For a little girl to be really brave 
and want to shave her head in support of her friend, I thought that was a
 huge statement and it builds character in a child.'

But after Kamryn's mother, Jamie Renfro, expressed her frustration on Facebook, the community began protesting the decision - and the story made headlines across the country.

Caprock Academy, Kamryn's school, agreed to let her return the following day and the school board held a special meeting. On Tuesday,
 board members voted 3-1 in favor of Kamryn's return.

The only member to vote against it was Bill Newcomer, who told NBC: 'I believe we as a country have succumbed to making 
decisions based on emotion, as opposed to logic and critical thinking.'

But Kamryn said her friends were happy to see her back in the classroom.

'They just thought I was brave to shave 
my head for cancer,' she told the Today show.

Her mother added: 'Proud is an understatement. We are so proud of her and Delaney both. They are amazing.'

Delaney, who met Kamryn at a gymnastics class, is about to start another round of chemotherapy following her fourth relapse from the cancer.

Her mother said: 'So many people don't realize what these kids go through when they're in the hospital,' she said. 'So when you actually have a friend who takes an amazing step in life and shaves off all their hair - Delaney has been just so excited.'
