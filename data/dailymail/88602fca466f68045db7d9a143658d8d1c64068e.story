A 22-year-old customer with a newborn baby says she has been kicked out of a Sydney clothing store  for young women after being told by staff that they don't cater for mums.

Tash O'Keefe says she was ridiculed  by shop assistants at Bardot's Macarthur Square store in Campbelltown, southwest Sydney, when she walked into the store with her daughter in a pram.

She was allegedly browsing for a dress to wear for her baby's baptism when a shop assistant told her: 'This isn't a mums clothing store take your daughter and leave.'

Tash O'Keefe says she was ridiculed by shop assistants at Bardot's Macarthur Square store in Campbelltown, southwest Sydney, when she walked into the store with her daughter in a pram.

Ms O'Keefe, who often shops at the store, says she was shocked and appalled by the way she was treated.

This prompted her to write a complaint on Bardot's Facebook page, demanding a formal apology from the female shop assistant.

The incident has outraged other mothers, some going as far as saying that they will boycott the store.

Friday afternoon's incident at Bardot was a traumatising experience for Ms O'Keefe, who says she was a regular customer before she became pregnant with Ella.

'When I went into the store my baby wasn't crying and I was being careful with my pram not to knock anything over so I see no reason for them to be so nasty to me,' Ms O'Keefe told Daily Mail Australia.

'But as soon as I walked into the store I could see the filthy looks the staff were giving each other, looking at me up and down and talking to each other about me.'

Ms O'Keefe says she had actually picked a $200 dress she liked from the store, wanting to wear it to her daughter's baptism, when a tall blonde shop assistant told her: 'This isn't a mums clothing store take your daughter and leave.'

Ms O'Keefe says she could hear other staff laughing while she was being ridiculed.

'There was no one else in the store beside the staff so no one was there to back me up,' she said.

'So I told the girl that she had no right to speak to me like that and that I actually wanted to buy a dress from the shop.'

That's when Ms O'Keefe was further told by the staff member: 'It's okay we can afford to lose a customer as we have hundreds here everyday.'

'I was on the verge of tears but I didn't want to cry in front of my baby girl,' Ms O'Keefe said

Shocked and embarrassed by what she had just experienced, Ms O'Keefe rushed out of the store and didn't get the name of the shop assistant.

'I was just devastated and on the verge of tears but I didn't want to cry in front of my baby girl plus the rest of the shopping centre was quite busy,' Ms O'Keefe said.

'This has never happened to me before. But I can tell you now that this hasn't just happened at this store. All the other shops I walked into today, staff were rude to me.'

Ms O'Keefe took to social media to lodge her complaint on Bardot's Facebook page later on Friday afternoon.

'I would like the girl to provide a formal apology,' she wrote.

'Please investigate this horrible behavior further. I have told all of my friends about my experience and they have to theirs and so on so forth. So you haven't just lost one shopper you've lost many.'

Other mothers have been outraged by the incident, some saying that they will 'never shop in any Bardot shop again'.

Another parent claimed she was in the same Campbelltown store and felt unwelcomed by staff.

'It's funny I should read this as the couple of times I've been Bardot Campbelltown pushing a pram, I've not had a very welcoming feeling either,' the mother wrote.

'After reading this I definitely won't be stepping foot in there again.'

The Facebook complaint has since gained more than 2,830 likes, 614 comments and 524 shares.

Bardot's Facebook page has also been flooded with comments from customers who were disgusted by what they read.

Ms O'Keefe is yet to hear back from a Bardot spokesperson.

'I have no idea why mums are being targeted but it seems as though shop assistants these days need to know more about customer service,' she said.

'I think I at least deserve a formal apology from the shop assistant and I also want her to apologise to all the other mothers she has ridiculed.' 

Bardot, a franchise for women's clothing, has not responded to Daily Mail Australia's inquiries.
