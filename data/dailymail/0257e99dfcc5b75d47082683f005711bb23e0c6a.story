Michael Clarke admitted his Australian side couldn’t get home quickly enough after a humiliating defeat by Pakistan in Abu Dhabi.

And English cricket bosses in search of a blueprint to neuter Mitchell Johnson next summer and regain the Ashes may decide to look no further than the slow, low surfaces served up for the Australians in the UAE.

Having lost the first Test in Dubai by 221 runs, they surrendered the second by an eye-watering 356. It is the biggest margin of victory by runs in Pakistan’s history – and the worst inflicted on the Aussies for 34 years.

Whichever way you spin it, the chances are you’ll end up confusing an Australian batsman.

‘The players will be happy we’re going home to play in conditions we’re accustomed to,’ said a shell-shocked Clarke. ‘We’ve got to talk about what’s just happened.’

The result, which lifts Pakistan up to third in the ICC Test rankings – one place above England – means Australia have now lost 10 of their 14 Tests away from home since the start of 2013, including last year’s double whammy of 4-0 in India and 3-0 in England.

And while England are in no position to gloat following their capitulation to Johnson a year ago, they will have noted with interest the Australians’ renewed struggles against spin.

‘I was hopeful we’d learned some of the lessons from India, but it doesn’t look that way,’ said Clarke. ‘The best teams win away from home consistently. It shows we’ve got a lot of work still to do. We’re a lot more comfortable playing in our own back yard.’

First Test (Cardiff) - 8–12 July

Second Test (Lord's) - 16–20 July

Third Test (Edgbaston) - 29 July–2 August

Fourth Test (Trent Bridge) - 6–10 August

Fifth Test (The Oval) - 20–24 August

If England do decide their best hope of a fourth successive home Ashes win next summer lies in encouraging groundsmen at Cardiff, Lord’s, Edgbaston, Trent Bridge and The Oval to produce turning tracks, it will shock no one at all.

Their victory over the Australians in 2013 centred on Graeme Swann’s series haul of 26 wickets on pitches left deliberately dry.

The policy had its drawbacks. Confronted by a rampant Johnson on Australia’s bouncier tracks three months later, England wilted hopelessly, and lost 5-0.

But coach Peter Moores and captain Alastair Cook may feel emboldened by the progress made by Moeen Ali’s off-spin during the 3-1 win against India. Having begun the summer derided as a part-timer, he ended up taking 19 cheap wickets against a team with a reputation for devouring slow bowlers.

The success of Pakistan’s inexperienced spin attack in the UAE will do little to dissuade them.

Yasir Shah, a leg-spinner playing in his first Test series, finished with 12 wickets at 17, while Zulfiqar Babar, a slow left-armer who had previously played only two Tests, managed 14 at 26.

Nathan Lyon – Australia’s frontline spinner – managed three wickets at 140. Just as relevant was Johnson’s modest series haul of six. Pakistan’s cherry on the top was captain Misbah-ul-Haq’s 56-ball century on Sunday, equalling Viv Richards’s Test record.

For the time being, at least, Australia look a rabble.
