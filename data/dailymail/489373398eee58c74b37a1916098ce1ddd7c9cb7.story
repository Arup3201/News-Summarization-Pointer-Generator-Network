'I want people to really understand what the world of modelling is about, and how hard we work,' says Naomi Campbell.

It looks like all the the hard work paid off: the supermodel, 43, looks better than ever in a shoot for The Edit net-a-porter's online magazine.

In the accompanying interview, she reveals the 
gruelling regime she undertook to prepare for a Versace show 14 years 
ago.

'For ten days prior… I just drank juice - 
carrot, ginger, pineapple - to cleanse,' she told the magazine.

Cambell returned to the fashion house, walking for Versace's Atelier AW13 Couture show.

The
show was also a personal moment, reuniting her with the Versace family,
'It was emotional for me to do the show after 14 years,' she says. 
'When I did my fitting in those amazing clothes, it was just 
overwhelming.'

But even supermodels feel insecure sometimes and Naomi admitted that when she walked onto the catwalk and the room was silent, she thought; ’Oh my God, they don’t want me here!'

In fact, her show-stopping entrance left the audience mute with admiration, instantly eclipsing models 25 years her junior.

And although Naomi looks better than ever at 42, she does allow herself to indulge occasionally:'I'm not extreme about what I eat – I let 
chocolate and crisps come in at times. You have to allow the little 
things that make you happy.'

She also attributes her physique to 
Pilates, which has become 'very important'.

Brought up by a single mother, Campbell studied ballet before beginning her stellar modelling career.

'My mum is one of my main mentors… she always gave me the best advice,' she says.

Now it's Naomi's turn to be the mentor and she's enjoying it.

'I like the mentoring aspect, as opposed to sitting in my chair and judging someone. It's really rewarding to see the models transformed and it makes me feel like I'm doing something right.'

The Face sees Campbell competing with fellow model judges, Erin O'Connor and Caroline Winberg, as they search for the next top supermodel, although she's much more interested in the advice and help she can offer as opposed to seeing her talent win.

She admits: 'Whether my model wins or not, she will have learned and we will have helped her – that's really why I came on the show.'

There is no one better to offer such advice to young models; Campbell's life has been at the very core of fashion. 

She was spotted at the age of just 15 in London's Covent Garden, and from
posing for the world's greatest photographers, such as Steven Meisel 
and Mario Testino, to walking for the late Yves Saint Laurent and 
befriending the likes of Azzedine Alaïa, she's thankful to all.

'I 
learned something from each and every one I worked with; their different
styles and ways of how they wanted you to be,' she says.

Away from the modelling
world, Naomi is dedicated to a number of charities; raising money for 
Haiti, Aids relief, Nelson Mandela Children's Fund for vulnerable 
children and Fashion For Relief, her own charity that she founded in 
2005.

She remains close to Nelson Mandela, who she describes as a huge 
inspiration, 'There will never be anyone like him again. When you meet 
him, you just get such a positive aura. It's incredible.'

Campbell's 
work also extends to the underrepresentation of black models on the 
covers of glossy magazines and on the runway, 'There is still racism'. 
Although, she feels there has been some change in the industry for 
models, 'Now, it's very important to have a personality; it's not just 
about a pretty face any more.' Not that Campbell herself was ever 'just'
anything; she has always been a personality.
