British Gas and npower have provoked fury today by announcing an inflation-busting rise in energy bills – even though the price of power has fallen over the past year.

British Gas today unveiled a dramatic increase of six per cent on gas and electricity prices while npower raised its prices by up to 9.1 per cent. Both will come into effect from next month.

This will see a rise in the average bill for customers of around £80.

The rise will affect millions of households and plunge more people into fuel poverty just as the winter months set in.

Bills, bills, bills: British Gas is hiking rates by six per cent - increasing the average bill to £1,336

Audrey Gallacher, Director of energy at Consumer Focus, said: ‘Two price hikes on the same day will just reinforce the views and prejudices of consumers – whether justified or not - about a lack of transparency and competitiveness in the market.

‘People are not convinced that they are getting a fair deal.

'Unless they can be reassured about the relationship between costs, prices and profits, consumer distrust will continue, companies won’t get their message across, and the success of the regulator will be questioned.

'Consumers need to see the Government and regulator taking big steps to help mitigate the rising cost of energy for customers.’

Millions of families are already 
struggling to pay their energy bills amid the biggest squeeze on 
household incomes for more than 60 years.

The price rise will lead to renewed 
claims that energy giants are profiteering. The firm’s parent company 
Centrica has already posted profits of £1.7billion in the first half of 
this year.

British Gas managing director Phil Bentley defended the company's price increases,
arguing: 'Britain’s North Sea gas supplies are running out, and British
Gas has to pay the going rate for gas in a competitive global 
marketplace.

'Furthermore, 
the investment needed to maintain and upgrade the national grid to 
deliver energy to our customers’ homes, and the costs of the 
Government’s policies for a clean, energy-efficient Britain, are all 
going up.

'Unfortunately, we cannot run our business sustainably on lower margins and still make the investments in jobs and future energy sources that Britain needs, especially if the country is to grow its way out of recession.

‘Investments in the infrastructure of Britain, in the Grid, is what will keep the lights on.’

But even though the price of buying 
electricity on the open market is six per cent lower than it was 12 
months ago, all the big six energy firms are all expected to hike their 
prices before Christmas.

Four other major gas companies – EDF, E.ON, SSE and Scottish Power – are all expected to increase 
rates either before or during winter.

SSE is hiking tariffs by nine per cent at the start of next week. Only E.ON has promised not to hike bills until after December 31.

Stephen Fitzpatrick, managing director
of small electricity supplier OVO Energy, said industry regulator Ofgem
had failed to get the market working better.

'Out of touch': British Shadow Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Caroline Flint said families are already struggling to make ends meet and called for ministers to get to grips with energy bills

But Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy 
spokesman, said people would not understand why bills had to rise when 
British Gas was making so much money.

‘Hard-pressed families and businesses 
need much more transparency on costs, pricing and profits to know 
whether they’re getting a fair deal,’ she said.

‘Unless ministers get to grips with 
spiralling energy bills, people will rightly think that this Government 
is completely out of touch with families and pensioners struggling to 
make ends meet.’

Michelle Mitchell, of the charity Age 
UK, said: ‘Reports of price hikes as we head into winter will be leaving
many older people feeling extremely anxious about their heating bills.

'Cold homes pose a serious risk to the health of older people, yet a huge
number of older people cannot afford to heat them properly.’

Feeling the chill: Gas price rises could hit the most vulnerable, including the elderly and poor

Energy bills have doubled in the past 
decade and last year each of the big six hiked prices. British Gas 
pushed them up by 18 per cent for gas and 16 per cent for electricity.

The firms blame the price hikes on the
rising cost of imported gas on international markets. However wholesale
energy prices are currently £51 per megawatt hour, compared with £54 
per megawatt hour this time last year.

In the first six months of the year 
Centrica posted a 23 per cent rise in operating profits for its domestic
heating and power division, making £345million before tax.

'Keeping the lights on': Managing Director of British Gas, Phil Bentley, defended the company's price hikes

The latest price increase comes just months after chief executive Sam Laidlaw received pay and perks of £4.1million for last year's work.

He was also awarded shares worth an additional £5.05million which he could be entitled to receive in 2014 depending on the company's performance.

His perks include a £684 discount on his annual energy bill - more than half the amount paid by the average family.

Energy firms
hiking prices just before winter is a familiar story, with the prices 
falling once the cold months are over. The falls tend to be much smaller
than the rises however.

Ann Robinson, director of consumer 
policy at uSwitch, said British Gas’s move was ‘devastating', adding: 'This is a bitter blow for consumers and comes just ahead of winter when the impact on bills will be even more acute.

'With SSE’s price hike coming into effect next Monday and now Britain’s biggest supplier announcing a hike of its own, the writing is on the wall for consumers this winter – energy bills are going skywards.

'Consumers will be very disappointed – the pressure of an extra £100 or so on energy bills will leave many buckling and forced to face another winter where they are scared to turn on the heating for fear of the cost. 

'Consumers cannot afford to sit back. There’s more than £300 difference between the cheapest and most expensive energy tariffs on the market – this is like shaving a quarter off your annual bill.

'Given today’s news, I would urge consumers to switch now to get the benefit on their winter bills.'

Unions and consumer groups angrily attacked British Gas and called on the Government to take urgent action to tackle rising fuel prices.

Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: 'With winter approaching, low-waged people will now be terrified about how they are going to find another £80.

'Money from the poor is going to the pockets of Centrica shareholders. This is further shameful abuse by out of control, greedy fuel companies, sitting on piles of profit.

'Alongside the Government's punish the poor strategy, millions of households will be forced further and further down the path to poverty.

It is high time that the Government intervened to take back from these grasping companies. Why is it that when wholesale fuel prices go up, these companies take from customers, yet, when wholesale prices go down, they still take from customers?'

Citizens Advice is running a Big Energy 
Saving Week from October 22 to 27 to help consumers find ways
to cut their fuel bills.

Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian 
Guy said: 'Many British Gas customers will find the possibility of a 
price rise really frightening.

'Bill increases throw already stretched 
budgets into turmoil, with people forced to find more ways to scrimp and
save. But there are things that people can do to save money on their 
fuel bills.'

Dozens of new gas power stations could be built across Britain to help slash long-term energy prices.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey told The Times he will propose a loophole to get around costly climate change targets to stem the ever-soaring price of electricity.

Under Mr Davey’s proposals, energy companies would be allowed to dodge new emissions targets because of concerns about the cost of building wind farms and nuclear reactors.

His plans would allow energy companies to sidestep having to cut their own carbon footprints - a key goal of environmental groups - if other sectors can instead cut emissions and go green cheaper through advances in technology.

Mr Davey told The Times: 'Let’s imagine that in 2022, a new technology comes along which makes it quicker and cheaper to decarbonise in the transport sector than it would in the energy sector.

'We want to make sure that policies we put in place are flexible, so that the transport sector would take up more of the slack.'

He said the UK will be forced to still rely on gas in the coming decades, saying: 'I think people need to be rather calmer about this debate.

'Gas in the next few decades is going to play a critical role in our energy and climate change strategy. It’s not gas versus renewables versus nuclear. We are going to need them all.'

The idea of the loophole was criticised by environmental campaigners, who said it could be exploited.
