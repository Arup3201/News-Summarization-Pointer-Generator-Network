Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has rubbished reports suggesting he has been out partying with Canadian rapper Drake during his time in the United States.

Sturridge has been training in Los Angeles in order to help his recovery from a thigh injury after being given permission by Liverpool to fly over to America.

However The Sun claimed that the crocked England international has been partying with Drake 'until the early hours - despite jetting out there for sports injury rehab'.

He then added just one minute later: 'Looking forward to another week of double session.

'If you don't hear it from me or anyone associated or see pictures. Don't believe it.... Love my fans...'
