The notoriously reticent Anna Wintour has let her guard down to answer a series of questions about her likes, her dislikes and the one thing she will never wear.

In Vogue's new episode of 73 Questions, the magazine's editor-in-chief opens up about her life from inside her office, giving her interviewer a tour of the hallways, fashion closet and editing room as she answers his questions.

Supermodel Karlie Kloss even makes a cameo in the fashion closet, where she asks Anna if there's anything she would refuse to wear. 'Head-to-toe black,' the fashion maven answers without hesitation.
