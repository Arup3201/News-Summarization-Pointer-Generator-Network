Andre Schurrle is too young to be weighed down too much by the burden. His first World Cup has gone well and his status in world football is being elevated every time he comes on and makes an impact, so whatever happens now the Chelsea player should have fond memories of 2014.

Yet even at the age of 23 he is aware of the sense of unfulfilled expectations. While the rest of the world is allowing itself to be overwhelmed by the consistency of the German national team reaching their fourth consecutive World Cup semi-final, the feeling in Germany is somewhat different.

Characteristically the nation is dwelling on what more could be achieved, the feeling being that this generation of players have been in gestation for some time now.

Ready: Schurrle, who scored in the last 16 against Algeria, says his side are ready to win the World Cup

Through: German centre-back Mats Hummels' header sails over the goalkeeper and in off the bar

In reality it is time they gave birth to something special and won a trophy.

‘We have this feeling,’ said Schurrle after the 1-0 win against France. ‘We are really close and we all feel we have a big chance to win the World Cup. In the last few years we have come close in tournaments but now we want to win it.

'We want to go to the final and win the title; that was our goal from the beginning. It is going to be tough. But it doesn’t matter who we play, we look at ourselves and how we play.’

Per Mertesacker, the Arsenal centre-half who endured the disappointment of being dropped before the game, has expressed the same thought.

All together: The team spirit within the German squad has developed as this team has grown up together

‘We finished the last two World Cups in third position and that is really consistent,’ said Mertesacker. ‘What we need in Germany after all these years is a title. We are talking about titles and trophies.’

Indeed. Before the game against France in the Maracana, Germany manager Joachim Low hung up a signed Germany shirt from the 1954 team in the dressing room.

On Friday, as they prepared to take on France, Low wanted to remind his players that it was 60 years to the day that Germany had won their first World Cup, which at the time was a shock performance dubbed the ‘Miracle of Bern’ but which laid the foundations of the post-War successes of German football.

Since then there have been World Cup wins in 1974 and 1990, along with European Championship triumphs in 1972, 1980 and 1996.

Joy: Mertesacker, Schweinsteiger and Neuer celebrate beating France to reach a fourth consecutive semi-final

Expectation: 18 years is a long time without a trophy for a team that always reaches the semi-finals

But while an 18-year gap between trophies would be nothing to worry about in England, for Germany it is beginning to nag.

‘It’s quite a performance it you are constantly in the semi-final,’ said Low on Friday night. But he was aware of the subtext of the questioning and added: ‘And yes, we will try to make the next step.’

This is the German generation that came of age in 2009, winning in the European Under-21 championships in Sweden against England.

In the final that night in Malmo their team included Manuel Neuer, Benedikt Howedes, Mats Hummels, Sami Khedira and Mesut Ozil, all of whom started against France and who represent the heart of Germany now.

The England team, beaten comprehensively 4-0 that night, included only Theo Walcott and James Milner who now feature for England, though Joe Hart would have played had he not been suspended for the final.

Superb: Neuer's strng save in the final moments against France has earned him plenty of praise

It was Neuer and Hummels who took the plaudits in the Maracana. Neuer is so good ‘he could play in midfield for Germany’ said Low, referring to the ‘sweeper-keeper’ style of the German No 1.

His ability to pass with his feet allows him to come well out of his box to clear up long balls, which permits the German back four to push up high.

‘He is the best in the world,’ said his Bayern team-mate Jerome Boateng. His last-minute save, pushing away Karim Benzema’s strike, was almost nonchalant, a throwback to Oliver Kahn and Peter Schmeichel, goalkeepers schooled in handball who had that ability to stand tall and simply punch balls away.

‘I try to copy the style of a handball goalkeeper when a forward is one on one,’ said Neuer, who played the game at school.

There was some respite for Germany in the euphoria of the quarter-final win. Until now, Low and his team have endured criticism in Germany for the style of their football against Ghana and the unconvincing manner of their win against Algeria.

Golden generation: Neuer has progressed through from the U21 squad with many in this team

‘If other teams won the World Cup this way they would be seen as clever,’ said Thomas Muller. ‘People would rave about them.

'I don’t want to end up winning the World Cup and find that we have to be apologising for it, saying: “Sorry we only won the final 1-0.”’

Muller need not worry. The mood has eased somewhat after victory against France and Germany seem to be evolving into something impressive here.

The hosts will be without Neymar and Thiago Silva for Tuesday’s semi-final in Belo Horizonte and it now looks, with their creative spark gone, that only sheer willpower and determination will get Brazil over the line to the final. For Germany, the opportunities are suddenly opening up.
