Ikram Ismail has been jailed for stalking Big Brother winner Kate Lawler and leaving her bizarre gifts

A stalker who sent ex-Big Brother star Kate Lawler bizarre Islamic gifts causing the bomb squad to be scrambled has been jailed.

Army bomb disposal experts were sent to the offices of Rock FM, in Preston, Lancashire, where Miss Lawler works as a DJ, after obsessed Ikram Ismail sent her a box containing a burnt Koran, a court heard. 

Ismail, of Preston, had never met the 34-year-old personality but started leaving strange gifts at the studio on St Paul's Square, in Deepdale, Preston Magistrates' Court heard.

On the first occasion, in February 2014, the bomb squad was called to a suspicious box, which was later found to contain a Koran, wrapped in traditional fabric.

Among other strange 'gifts' Ismail, who pleaded guilty to stalking, left in the studio grounds over the next 12 months were a book entitled the Ninety-Nine Names of Allah, a burnt Koran, a burnt jumper, a box containing Muslim leaflets, and a 'Kate' keyring. 

He also left the DJ chocolates and a clock, scattered safety pins, a soup cookbook and a parcel containing a 'love' fridge magnet and chocolates.

Prosecutor Suzy Privett told the court that on Hallowe'en last year, DJ Jordan North saw the defendant trying to get into a party, believing Kate Lawler was there. A PCSO later attended and found Ismail, and he was issued with an acceptable behaviour contract.

However, on Valentine's Day this year he sent further gifts to Miss Lawler, followed by a card signed 'Ikram'.

The celebrity became aware of his behaviour, and when she checked her social media accounts, she found several messages from him dating back to July 2014, the court heard.

In a victim impact statement, she said she accepted her career attracted a 'certain amount of attention', but said she was unnerved by his attention and she had a right to a private and family life. 

She said the thought of bumping into him frightened her. Miss Lawler declined to comment further.

It is not the first time Miss Lawler has been stalked. While working for Kerrang! Radio in Birmingham, she was sent underwear and sinister gifts.

Obsessed Mark Taylor sent dozens of newspaper cuttings and crude pictures to the former reality TV star's workplace.

In much of the correspondence, he declared his love for the DJ, sending her topless tabloid snaps of herself, a dictionary and, bizarrely, a dinner plate.

He even sent a magazine picture of two pairs of feet at the bottom of a bed with the male pair marked with his name and the female marked with 'Kate.'

Among other strange 'gifts' Ismail, who pleaded guilty to stalking, left in the studio grounds over the next 12 months were a book entitled the Ninety-Nine Names of Allah, a burnt Koran, a burnt jumper, a box containing Muslim leaflets, and a 'Kate' keyring 

The 49-year-old set about his campaign of mailing in 2005, but after breaking three separate restraining orders, Judge Anthony King jailed him for eight months in 2011.

The Beckenham-born celebrity shot to fame after winning Big Brother's third series, broadcast in 2002.

She later became a DJ on Capital FM and co-presented a breakfast TV show. She has also taken part in game shows and done modelling work.

District Judge Jane Goodwin jailed Ismail for two months and ordered him to pay an £80 victim surcharge.
