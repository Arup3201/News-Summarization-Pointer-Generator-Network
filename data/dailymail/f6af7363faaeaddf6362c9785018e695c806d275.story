A former RAF navigator has become the Britain's oldest  person to have sex change surgery after NHS-funded operations.

Ruth Rose, 81, of Newhaven, East Sussex, underwent the final stage of her gender realignment surgery in July after she started living as a woman four years ago.

Ms Rose, who had been James - a father of three and grandfather of four, said she had always known she was living in the wrong body, and had started dressing up in secret while at school.

At 18, as James, she embarked on an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering and went on to join the RAF at 23. 

When she married in 1961, Ms Rose felt she could not tell her wife about her feelings, hoping instead that they would go away.

The couple were married for 42 years and had three children, but after they divorced amicably 11 years ago, Ms Rose began to be more open about living as a woman - having previously been living as a man at home, but dressing up to see friends.

Surgery: Ruth is the oldest in Britain to have the surgery, and her treatments and operation cost the NHS £4,000

Family: Ms Rose, an activist and public speaker for charities like Age UK, says she is still close to her ex-wife, and says although her family tolerated her decision to live as a woman, they were shocked by the surgery

She started hormone therapy four years ago when she stopped attending events as a man, and decided to undergo the dramatic surgery after coming through an unrelated operation for a hip and knee replacement. 

'My doctor had said I should have the gender ­transformation operation but I thought I was too old. I thought I had left it too late. But the surgeons wouldn’t have done it if they didn’t think I could go through with it,' the charity worker told the Sunday People.

Ms Rose, an activist and public speaker for charities like Age UK, says she is still close to her ex-wife, and says although her family tolerated her decision to live as a woman, they were shocked by the surgery.

Past life: At 18, as James, she embarked on an apprenticeship in mechanical engineering and went on to join the RAF at 23 before marrying her wife of 42 years in 1961 

People seeking to receive gender reassignment treatment, which usually involves hormone therapy and surgery, on the NHS must first see their GP.

The doctor will then refer them directly to either a gender specialist, gender clinic or local mental health team for assessment. 

After at least 12 months of living as a woman and undergoing hormone therapy male-to-female patients are considered eligible for genital surgery. 

During this time, patients should present consistently, on a day-to-day basis and across all settings of life, in their desired gender role, including coming out to partners, family, friends, and community members.

There is no requirement for the patient to have commenced a social role transition before a recommendation is made for hormone therapy.

Facial feminisation surgery is not usually funded by the NHS.

Male-to-Female genital surgery typically requires a hospital stay of about a week and a period of recuperation that can vary from a fortnight to two months. 

She is the oldest in Britain to have the surgery, with her treatments and the operation, which she had on the NHS, costing £4,000.

The NHS Gender Services, which provide specialist assessment and treatment of Gender Dysphoria, are offered to people over 18, and there is no upper limit. 

To undergo such major irreversible procedures, NHS guidelines state that patients must be sufficiently physically fit. Their treatment is carried out on a case by case basis, according to their individual needs and situation.

Ms Rose said she had spent five days in hospital for her surgery, which took around two months to heal. 

Addressing criticism she may face for having the procedure on the health service, she said: 'You get people who can’t keep slim or who smoke and have all the related health issues – but the NHS will still treat them.' 

Ms Rose said she did not have a full construction, and that at her age she did not see herself having a sexual relationship with anyone. 

As well as more noticeable physical changes, such as her bust and higher waistline, Ms Rose said she had found that some everyday activities had to be performed differently as a woman, such as doing up the buttons on a jacket, or picking up an item from the floor. 

And even her driving has been affected. 

'I’m sure I’ve become much more like a woman in so many ways,' she said. 'I would never describe myself as a great driver – but now I’m forgetting to signal before I turn.' 

She said that undergoing hormone treatment had also changed her outlook on life. 

She added: 'I have never been abused by anybody about this and I wouldn’t expect to be. We are not freaks to be on show and it is so nice to be part of a community in the gender that I feel is right.'
