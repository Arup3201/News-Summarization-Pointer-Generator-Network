A 'corrupt’ detective who worked on the initial Stephen  Lawrence murder probe is to be investigated over claims that he sabotaged the inquiry.

John Davidson will be the focus of a major new independent investigation into alleged corruption in the case.

In a separate move yesterday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission announced it was to investigate a Scotland Yard commander and two former  senior officers over claims they were involved in a plot to spy on Stephen’s  family around the time of the Macpherson public inquiry into his death.

The 18-year-old aspiring architect was stabbed to death by a racist white gang in April 1993. Not until 2012 were two of his killers convicted, and then only after a long campaign led by this newspaper to bring them to justice.

The probe into Davidson, to be announced in the next fortnight, will examine claims he had a corrupt relationship with the gangster father of one of Stephen’s killers and deliberately stalled the inquiry.

In police intelligence reports the former detective sergeant was described as having ‘no integrity as a police officer’ and being ‘open to offers from any source if financially viable’.

The Metropolitan Police referred a file on Davidson to the IPCC two months ago after a damning official report raised questions about his conduct in the days following Stephen’s murder.

Since the report was published, a series of Daily Mail investigations has exposed a web of suspected corruption in the Scotland Yard inquiries into the stabbing of Stephen and axe killing of private investigator Daniel Morgan in 1987.

Scotland Yard chiefs believe it would be ‘inappropriate’ for the force to head the Davidson corruption probe. Instead, it will be carried out by a team of investigators from the IPCC or detectives from a provincial force, supervised by the watchdog.

Barrister Mark Ellison’s review of the Lawrence case in March found that Davidson may have acted corruptly.

It was claimed he had admitted having a ‘corrupt connection’ with gangland boss Clifford Norris, the father of David Norris, who was finally convicted of Stephen’s murder in 2012 along with Gary Dobson.

Since March, the Mail has published a series of investigations that showed how links between ‘bent coppers’ and serious organised criminals in South London might have hampered or sabotaged the Stephen Lawrence and Daniel Morgan murder inquiries.

Mr Morgan, 37, a father of two, was killed with an axe in March 1987, allegedly while trying to blow the whistle on police corruption. Nobody has yet been convicted in spite of five police investigations and admissions by the Met that corruption played a part in those failings.

The original investigation into Stephen Lawrence's murder in 1993 was hugely discredited. The teenager's family had to wait almost two decades for justice

It is believed that as well as working on the original Lawrence investigation, Davidson also worked on the ‘periphery’ of the Morgan murder inquiry six years earlier. He now runs a bar in Minorca and denies any wrongdoing.

Should he choose to stay on the Spanish holiday island, it is not clear how police would interview him about the Lawrence corruption allegations. He could only be extradited if there is already sufficient evidence to charge him.

An IPCC spokesman said last night: ‘The IPCC received a referral from the Metropolitan Police on April 9 relating to the conduct of former detective sergeant John Davidson and specifically whether he acted corruptly during the investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence.’

Stephen’s family have long been convinced police corruption hindered the initial murder probe.

One of those to be investigated over the disputed spying claims and alleged ‘discreditable conduct’ is  Commander Richard Walton, who was temporarily moved from his post as head of the Met’s counter-terrorism command in March.

The review by Mr Ellison alleged he and the two other police officers, Bob Lambert and Colin Black, were involved in a plot to gather ‘fascinating and valuable’ intelligence from an undercover officer who was spying on the Lawrence family and their supporters.

Stephen’s father Neville Lawrence welcomed the IPCC investigation last night.

Speaking from his home in Jamaica, he said: ‘I hope the investigation is thorough and gets to the truth.’
