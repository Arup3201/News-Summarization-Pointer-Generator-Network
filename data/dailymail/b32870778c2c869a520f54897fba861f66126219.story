Jailed: Father-of-two Derek Rigby was jailed for 30 months for the 'gross breach of trust'

A care home worker repeatedly sneaked into an elderly dementia patient's bedroom and sexually molested her, a court heard.

Derek Rigby, 44, was jailed for 30 months after he took advantage of the woman, aged in her eighties, who had suffered a series of mini strokes.

The father-of-two was caught molesting the elderly patient after her concerned daughter  planted a 'nanny cam' in her bedroom at the  care home in the north east.

Michael Stephenson, prosecuting, told Liverpool Crown Court the victim's daughter became concerned a male carer was undressing her at night and coming in for a 'kiss and a cuddle'.

Rigby was identified as the culprit after the secret camera caught him in the act.

He was filmed coming into the victim's room to give her some medicine and then began to remove her bra and molest her.

He also encouraged the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, to perform an indecent act on him.

The court heard the carer continued his campaign of abuse despite noticing a severe personality change in his victim after a series of strokes that left her 'disinhibited'.

Rigby of Wigan, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to four charges of engaging in sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder between December 2013 and June this year.

Joseph Kotrie-Monson, for Rigby, said his client was suffering from stress and exhaustion at the time and otherwise had an unblemished record from his six years in the care industry.

He added Rigby's life was 'in tatters' but his wife and friends were standing by him.

Jailing him for 30 months, Judge Andrew Menary QC said: 'Anyone who sees your actions on that night will be shocked and horrified at the gross breach of trust by you toward this vulnerable person.

'People who have relatives in care are entitled to expect that their loved ones will be looked after and cared for for appropriately and no subject to systematic sexual abuse at the hands of someone in a senior position.'

Rigby was also ordered to sign on the Sex Offenders' Register for life and banned from working with vulnerable adults and children.
