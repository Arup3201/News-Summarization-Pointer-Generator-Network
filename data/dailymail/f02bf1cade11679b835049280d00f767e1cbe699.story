The ‘Angelina Jolie effect’ is doubling the number of British women having both breasts removed – despite never having been diagnosed with cancer.

About 800 women will go under the knife this year to follow Miss Jolie and have preventive double mastectomies – twice the normal figure – according to a nationwide study.

Professor Gareth Evans, an expert in cancer genetics at Manchester University, who  led the study, said the Hollywood actress’s ‘brave decision’ would save hundreds of lives in Britain.

Inspiration: Actress Angelina Jolie underwent preventive double mastectomy last year

Miss Jolie, 38, below, had the operation in February last year after doctors said her chance  of developing breast cancer was high.

Prof Evans believed that women had  seen pictures of Miss Jolie, partner of Brad Pitt, and thought: ‘If she  can look that good after her operation, perhaps it won’t be  so bad.’
