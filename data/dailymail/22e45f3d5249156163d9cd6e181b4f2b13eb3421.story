Yosemite National Park has have warned that 1,700 people who visited the park this summer may have been exposed to a rare, rodent-borne disease that has so far been linked to two deaths.

In emails sent on Monday evening, the park said that anyone who may have been at the park between mid-June and late August may have been exposed to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

The disease can be carried in the urine, saliva and feces of infected deer mice.

Scare: Officials are now warning visitors, especially those who 
stayed in tent cabins in the park's Curry Village (pictured) to be aware of flu-like symptoms

Yosemite said that anyone who may be experiencing flu-like symptoms to see a doctor as soon as possible.

The Park Service told the LA Times: "An outreach effort is currently underway by the park concessionaire to contact visitors who stayed in "Signature Tent Cabins" at Curry Village from mid-June through the end of August.

'These individuals are being informed of the recent cases and are being advised to seek immediate medical attention if they exhibit any symptoms of hantavirus.'

A second person has died within a month from the rare rodent-borne disease hantavirus after visiting one of the most popular parts of Yosemite National Park.

Yosemite National Park in the western 
Sierra Nevada mountains of California has over Over 3.7 million people visitors every year

The first victim, a 37-year-old Alameda County man, is believed to have contracted the disease while staying in a tent cabin at the park's Curry Village in mid June. Details of the latest victim have not been released.

Hantaviruses are spread through rodent bites, urine or saliva.

Humans infected can develop potentially fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever  and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

Early symptoms are similar to the flu and include chills, fever and muscle aches.

Sufferers may may begin to feel better for a short  time, but within 1-2 days, experience breathing difficulties, a dry cough vomiting and headaches.

Of the 587 documented U.S. cases since the virus was identified in 1993, about one-third proved fatal. There is no specific treatment for the virus.

Almost all cases involving humans have been linked to contact with rodent excrement. Howver human-to-human transmission has been reported with the Andes mountains in South America.

The name hantavirus comes from the Hantan River area in South Korea, from where teh first cases were identified in the late 1970s.

The disease was formerly known as Korean hemorrhagic fever.

During the Korean war Several thousand United Nations soldiers became ill with the disease sparking a 25-year search for the cause.

There has been one other confirmed case of the illness, and a fourth possible case is currently being investigated.

Federal health authorities say symptoms may
develop up to 5 weeks after exposure to urine, droppings, or saliva of 
infected rodents, and visitors have been advised to watch for symptoms 
for up to six weeks.

Following
the first death, which was reported earlier this month, state health 
officials advised anyone with symptoms to seek medical attention and let
doctors know if they were camping in Yosemite.

Officials said thousands of people visit the park every month, so it would be impossible to track everyone who had set foot in Curry Village.

Curry Village is the most popular and economical lodging area in the park, a picturesque assemblage of rustic cabins at the base of the 3,000-foot promontory Glacier Point.

Gediman told the San Francisco Chronicle that of the 408 tent cabins in the village, 91 are of the 'signature' variety where the four cases had stayed, which feature more insulation and amenities than the others.

Gediman said contractors are working on the signature cabins to protect park-goers.

'They're doing everything they can to eliminate areas where mice can get into the cabins,' Gediman told the San Francisco Chronicle.

'This was never because the cabins were dirty, it was never because we didn't take care of them. This is just because approximately 20 percent of all deer mice are infected with hantavirus. And they're here in Yosemite Valley.'

This year's deaths mark the first such deaths in park visitors, although two others were stricken in a more remote area in 2000 and 2010, officials said.
