The Champions League, it most certainly ain’t. While those further up the food chain console themselves with the knowledge that they’re doing The Right Thing for a club that will be here long after Ronny Deila has departed, the manager is the guy left to deal with the realities on the ground.

From the eloquent Norwegian, there is no pretence that the Europa League group into which Celtic were pitched on Friday can possibly compare to what might have been. No disrespect to the good people of Salzburg, Zagreb and Giurgiu, but it hardly compares with taking on the very best from the Premier League and Bundesliga.

Instead of trying to blow smoke, Deila simply accepts UEFA’s second-tier club competition for what it is. Just as he accepts the responsibility for his team’ s play-off failure against NK Maribor.

My bad! Ronny Deila (R) accepts responsibility for Celtic's exit from the Champions League

‘Of course I am responsible for things here,’ he said, when asked if it was fair for fans to start judging him so soon into his time as manager.

‘It is better to take it out on me than on the rest. But I hope now I am going to show that we are going to progress as a team. We have also had some good games so far, it’s not only been bad, but of course the Champions League has been a big influence here.

‘I saw a lot of emotions through that and, now we have done that, we have to look forward to what we’re going to do in the league and building that style of play and the team we want.

‘The supporters and everyone wants to go into the Champions League. That’s the main thing. If you lose it, the emotions come, you get very sad of course and it’s not easy to see the big picture.’

Talk of big pictures and grand projects usually meets with short shrift and some fairly unprepossessing criticism from fans who view promises of jam tomorrow with a fair degree of suspicion.

Talking about the reaction since Tuesday night’s loss, Deila said: ‘Of course it is hard. It’s hard losing. But you have to look at the longer prospects and work on what you believe in - and build the team how you want it.

‘That has also been harder with the pressure on the Champions League all the time. Now that chapter is gone we can control the situation and the next chapter is to build the team and to get ready for next year.

‘We have to do good performances this year so we achieve the things we want to do. That’s a big task but that’s why I came here.

‘It’s very different when you see that three matches into the league, your season is over – that’s if I listen to some people!

‘We’ve got a lot of matches left in the league and a lot of matches in Europe and the cups, hopefully.’

Deila is adamant that he doesn’t regret a single thing – including leaving last year’s multiple Player of the Year, Kris Commons, on the bench – for the dispiriting 1-0 home loss to a team, Maribor, who had appeared there for the taking in last week’s 1-1 away draw.

‘I don’t have any regrets from Tuesday,’ he said. ‘We went into the game with a match plan but the first half was too passive. We should have gone harder on them.

‘But we didn’t want to sit back, we changed after the break and the first 20 minutes of the second half was much more aggressive. We created chances.

‘Look at the two matches, they were quite equal. It went against us. That is also about skills – but I think we improved from the Legia game.

‘You never know what would have happened if you did something differently. But we were well prepared, had a match plan – and knew what we were going to do if things weren’t going well. We made changes that made the team better, we just didn’t get a final result.

‘You can always think about what might have been. But we weren’t good enough, so we take the draw we’ve got – and look forward to competing in the Europa League.

What could have been? Ronny Deila has no regrets, including leaving Kris Commons out of the starting XI

‘Our aim is to get experience, of course, and to try to get through to the next stage. That’s something the club has done before but it’s a big challenge for us.

‘This is a new chapter. We have to prepare the team to do several things – win the league and win trophies, but also make the team ready for the Champions League next year, if we win the league.

‘That will make the experience will get now invaluable. It’s very hard for me to say whether we should get out of this group. We have a good chance to make some good results there.

‘These are still international games against good teams. Of course we wanted to be in the Champions League. But this is a good opportunity for us.

‘Yes, we can make an impact in the Europa League. Things are happening very quickly here. We’re getting better – and we will get better all the time.

‘We’ve had a lot of players out, we’ve got new players coming in that we haven’ t used yet. So the team will of course get better and better.

‘But it takes time to get players into the team, get injured players fit. Let’s see where we are in December.’

Step down: Celtic players react in the knowledge they will be playing in Europe's second tier competition

In December, they’ll be in Zagreb, taking on Dynamo in their final Group D fixture. It’s not Stamford Bridge, nor is it Schalke’s Veltins Arena – or Sporting Lisbon’s Estadion Jose Alvalade.

But it’s where Celtic are. In more ways than one.
