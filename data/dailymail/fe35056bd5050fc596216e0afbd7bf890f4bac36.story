Fired: Paramedic Bryce Reed was dismissed from the West, Texas emergency response squad two days after the blast

The West, Texas first responder arrested for having bomb-making materials was fired from his EMT job two days after the catastrophic blast, it has been revealed - as he has been accused of stealing from a fireman killed in the explosion whom he falsely referred to as his brother.

On Friday, it was revealed in that Bryce Reed had been 'let go' from the West, Texas emergency response squad -  two days after the blast that killed 15 people and injured about 200 others.

Reed was no longer part of West EMS on
April 19, according to an email obtained by The Associated Press that 
was sent by a regional EMS organization, the Heart of Texas Regional 
Advisory Council, to the state health officials.

The documents do not explain the reason for his firing.

Reed, 31, has been charged with possessing bomb-making materials, including a pipe and chemicals.

Authorities allege Reed possessed 
canisters that included a lighter, a digital scale, a plastic spoon and 
'several pounds of chemical powders' in separate bags.

His arrest came hours after Texas 
law enforcement officials announced a criminal investigation into the 
massive April 17 explosion, but authorities will not say whether they suspect Reed was involved.

The cause of the blast has not yet been determined.

Still, Reed's arrest was drawing attention in part because in the days following the blast, Reed didn't duck attention in West.

Arrest: Paramedic Bryce Reed, has been arrested after he was found to possess explosives

Destruction: This apartment complex near the fertilizer plant was destroyed by the explosion

Grieving: At last month¿s public memorial for the 12 people killed responding to the fire, Reed gave a heartfelt and often humorous eulogy for his close friend Cyrus Reed

He gave lengthy interviews to reporters, while other emergency responders didn't want to talk.

At the Czech Inn along Interstate 35,
his wife, Brittany, was a constant presence, always in motion 
organizing relief efforts and guiding the displaced to what they needed.

Reed is also being accused of stealing from one of the victims of blast, a firefighter that Reed eulogized and has referred to as his brother.

Though they share the same last name, Reed and Cyrus Reed are not related.

Cyrus Reed's sister Sarah told The Dallas Morning News that she has requested police officers to guard her brother’s apartment due to suspicions that Reed has been taking items from there since the explosion.

She told the paper: 'Instead of grieving my brother's death, we're dealing with all of this.' 

Reed had credited Cyrus for saving his life.

Upon reaching the plant, Bryce Reed 
said, he saw Cyrus' truck, so he kept on driving because he was 
confident the firefighter could handle the call. Minutes later, the 
plant erupted in a fire ball.

When Cyrus' body arrived at a funeral home three days later, Bryce Reed said he stayed up all night holding him.

'I got to hug him for the last time. 
He got there at 9 o'clock last night and I was there until 4 in the 
morning, holding onto my brother,' Reed said. 'And telling him I'm sorry
for everything that I did.'

Another of Reed's bizarre claims came in an interview outside the Czech Inn on April 21, when he spoke about being sick and facing his own mortality.

He said that he lost 60 pounds in 
five months, and that doctors couldn't pinpoint the source of his ailing
stomach despite performing 26 biopsies.

Three days after the explosion, Reed 
climbed onto a coffee table at a local hotel where displaced families 
picked over donated sweatshirts and pizza, telling the crowd, 'You're safe where you're at.

'If you're not, I'd be dragging you out of here myself.'

On Friday afternoon in West, several 
of Reed's neighbors stood outside near his red brick duplex, a 
neighborhood less than a mile from the plant where some homes' windows 
remained boarded.

They said they were shocked about his arrest.

Crystal Le Dane said he was a good 
neighbor who had changed her flat tire and sometimes gave medical advice
about her children's minor injuries and rashes.

'I would say he's an everyday guy. I never saw a red flag,' she said.

Reed grew up in suburban Dallas and said he had lived in West for 12 years.

At the Czech Inn the weekend after the
explosion, Brittany Reed pulled out her phone and played a video of 
what she said was the couple's young daughter playing with Cyrus just 
days before the blast.

According to an affidavit released by
the federal court in Waco, the McLennan County Sheriff's Office was 
called on Tuesday to home in Abbott, which is near West, about 'a 
possible destructive device' and related items.

Speaker: Bryce Reed was a paramedic who essentially became a spokesperson for the town of West after last month's deadly explosion at a fertilizer facility

Charged: Bryce Reed, a first responder at the fertilizer plant blast in West, Texas, is facing a charge of possession of a destructive device

The affidavit said that law enforcement officials determined that the device and related items belonged to Reed.

The
material is described as a 3.5-inch galvanized metal pipe an inch and a
half in diameter. Two galvanized end caps were attached to the pipe. 
One end cap had a small hole drilled into it.

Canisters containing a fuse, a lighter, six coils of metal ribbon and several pounds of chemical powders were also found.

The
powders were described as potassium nitrate, aluminum powder, red iron 
oxide, ammonium perchlorate, sulfur powder and other materials.

The
affidavit said that the materials had been left in a home near Waco by 
Reed on April 26, but the person at the home did not know what had been 
left.

Clearup: Students clean debris at a home in West, Texas, that was damaged due to the explosion. The blast caused tens of millions of dollars in damage to the surrounding area

Fatalities: Among the 14 people killed were 10 emergency responders

Potassium nitrate is used in fertilizers and can also be used in fireworks and gunpowder.

Aluminum
powder, potassium nitrate and sulfur are common ingredients in flash 
powder. The affidavit said ATF explosives and chemistry experts 
determined that the materials 'can be readily assembled into a 
destructive device.'

On his LinkedIn profile, Reed said he spent time at the U.S. Biological and Chemical Weapon Depot in Ft McClellan, Alabama.

Reed
also lists one year from 2010-2011 as a technician/regional safety 
officer for Allied International Emergency LLC., where he said response 
teams dealt with 'Weapons of Mass Destruction Response, Nuclear Event 
Management, Chemical or Biological Weapons Containment, Large Scale 
Environmental Loss Mitigation, to DOT/EPA small scale spill cleanup...'
