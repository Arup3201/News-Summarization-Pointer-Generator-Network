Luke Shaw is set to make his competitive debut for Manchester United against West Ham on Saturday.

The left back, signed for £30million from Southampton in the summer, missed the start of the season due to a hamstring injury.

But Shaw is expected to start this weekend due to a defensive crisis for Louis van Gaal, with the manager keen to shift Marcos Rojo into the middle.

The £30m left back from Southampton has had to make do with a place on the bench so far this season

Shaw played on United's pre-season tour in the US, though it was riddled by fitness concerns.

Van Gaal had Shaw going through extra training as he wasn't happy with his shape after returning from the World Cup with England.

Shaw, 19, had a superb campaign on the South Coast last season but has had to settle for a place on the bench so far for the Red Devils.

His lack of playing time under the Van Gaal despite returning from injury prompted fears that the Dutch coach didn't rate the youngster, with former coach Rene Meulensteen saying just that.
