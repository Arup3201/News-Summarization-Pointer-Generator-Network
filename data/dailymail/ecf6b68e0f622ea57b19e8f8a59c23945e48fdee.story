Mauricio Pochettino told his under-achieving Tottenham stars to improve their attitude after a shocking 2-1 defeat against Stoke City.

The Spurs chief was scathing in his assessment of his team after they slipped to their fourth home defeat in the Barclays Premier League at White Hart Lane.

Pochettino, who humiliated Christian Eriksen and Andros Townsend by dragging them off at half-time, is struggling to make an impact at the club.

The furious Tottenham chief said: ‘We need to find the solution and I need to change the mentality for the players.

‘They know my feelings like I know their feelings. I have been here for four months, we know the players and the players know me.

‘We feel the same, very disappointed and frustrated, and not happy because our performance was not good enough.

‘It’s clear we need to improve a lot. We need to improve and this is clear to analyse. Always in football you need time, different methods and philosophy but we need to improve quick.

‘In football you never have time, a long time – you need to take a result. We need to find a solution quickly and in the next few weeks, we change our mentality and find a solution, this is my challenge in the next few weeks.’

Kyle Naughton's late red card added salt to the wound on a day when Spurs never really found their form

Bojan Krkic scored his first goal for Stoke and their lead was doubled when Jon Walters scored again before the break.

Nacer Chadli gave Tottenham hope with a brilliant volley, but their changes of snatching an equaliser were lost when Kyle Naughton was given a straight red.

Pochettiho added: ‘After we conceded the first goal we were uncomfortable in possession of the ball and took rash decisions.

‘It is not possible in the Premier League it is not possible to make these mistakes and we conceded the second goal.

‘It’s true, the first half we played no good. In the second half we try to fix something to manage better the possession of the ball - they play very deep and create many chances but after 2-0 down it was difficult to change the game. When you lose always you are unhappy and put pressure on ourselves.’

Stoke were in complete control, even though Mark Hughes admitted he has had to be patient with Bojan.

Hughes said: ‘We are really pleased that he is finally coming to the fore. He started off like a house on fire when he first joined us in pre-season and people got a little bit carried away too early because I think we all felt it was going to take time to adjust.

‘He has bided his time and I have just stared to reintroduce him now and he has had the benefit of three or four months training at the intensity he needs to and he looks a very accomplished player again.

‘We are going to benefit from his ability and his goal-scoring because he is a good talent when he gets in good areas of the field. He hits shots off early and its difficult for keepers to react early enough and he will score goals for us this year.’
