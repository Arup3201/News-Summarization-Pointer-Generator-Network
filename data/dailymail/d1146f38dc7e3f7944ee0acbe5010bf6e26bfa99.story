An outraged Tennessee mother has held a 'nurse in' at a Knoxville Chick-Fil-A after a staff member told her to stop breastfeeding in the restaurant's playground because she was scaring other children.

Knoxville mother-of-two, Jennifer Day, was feeding her five-month old daughter, Kahlyn, at the Turkey Creek fast food joint last weekend.

When nearby customers complained, an employee of the restaurant, which caused controversy last year for its stance against gay marriage, approached Day and told her to stop breastfeeding in public or use a cover.

Nurse in: A group of mothers turned up on Wednesday night to the Turkey Creek Chick-Fil-A to protest after Jennifer Day was told off for breastfeeding

'An employee came up to me and told me some of the other parents were afraid of allowing their kids to play in the play area while I was feeding her, especially without any cover,' Day told NBC News.

Tennessee law states mothers can breastfeed in any public place, so Day was appalled by the request and told the young employee she was allowed to continue breastfeeding.

She said she doesn't use a cover because Kahlyn doesn't like it and always pulls it off.

'Any mother is allowed to breast feed her child if shes in that place otherwise,' she said. '(Breasts) were made for a purpose, a God-given ability. It's the best gift you can give to your child.'

On Tuesday, Chick-Fil-A said the manager at the restaurant 'has apologized and regrets any offense he may have caused.'

But Day and other mothers from the area staged a 'nurse in' at the Turkey Creek restaurant on Wednesday to protest the treatment.

Anna Hurley, who helped organize the event, told ABC News 6 the 'nurse in' was about education.

'We want everyone to feel safe. We 
want nursing mothers to feel safe because what is more family then a 
mother and her baby and this is a family restaurant,' Hurley said.

She added that it wasn't about punishing the restaurant.

'We just want to normalize breastfeeding. We just want society to change their views.'

Chick-Fil-A also said it was sending employees for training with the East Tennessee Breastfeeding Coalition to help them better understand the law.

By rights, a mother may breastfeed in any public or private place she is authorized to be.

The law also states breastfeeding shall not be considered public indecency or nudity, obscene, or sexual conduct, that local governments shall not prohibit breastfeeding in public by local ordinance and that employers must accommodate breastfeeding mothers at work.
