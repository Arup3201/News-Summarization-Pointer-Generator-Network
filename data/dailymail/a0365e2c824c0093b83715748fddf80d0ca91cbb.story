While not near the totals seen for the NFL playoffs or Super Bowl, it was ESPN's most-watched event outside of NFL or college football.

Many factors were in place to make it a big night for football on television. It was an exciting game, interest in the U.S. team was high because of the opening game victory against Ghana and World Cup viewing in general has been up. 

With a Sunday evening kick off, the game was played at a time many Americans were available to watch.

USA's final Group G game against Germany on Thursday kicks off at midday on the US East Coast and as early as 9am on the west coast.
