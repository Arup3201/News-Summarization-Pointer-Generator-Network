The entire crew of a flight that Ebola-infected nurse Amber Vinson took from Cleveland, Ohio, to Dallas has been put on paid leave as Frontier Airlines scrambles to show passengers it is taking every precaution it can after learning Ms Vinson may have been contagious on board one of its planes.

Ms Vinson boarded Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 on Monday with a low-grade fever after being told by Centers for Disease Control officials that she was OK to travel.

The CDC has since reversed course, saying that Ms Vinson 'should not have traveled on a commercial airline' and warning that all 132 passengers on board may have been exposed to the deadly disease.

Back in service: The Frontier Airlines jet that carried Amber Vinson hours before she was hospitalized with Ebola has been scrubbed and flew out of Denver on Wednesday

Frontier Airlines workers at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport wore latex gloves on Wednesday after it was revealed Ebola-infected Amber Vinson flew on a Frontier plane

Frontier announced on Wednesday that all six members of the  crew from Flight 1143 have been put on paid leave 'out of an abundance of caution.'

The plane, an Airbus A320, was thoroughly disinfected and the seat covers and carpets around where Ms Vinson sat were torn out and replaced. 

However, before the plane was removed from service and thoroughly cleaned, it made five flights across the country, including to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and Atlanta. 

Frontier said it stopped using the plane as soon as CDC officials notified the airline that Ms Vinson had flown on it. The CDC has not said there is any risk to passengers who flew on the plane after Ms Vinson got off. 

Amber Vinson asked for permission from the CDC before boarding a plane from Cleveland to Dallas while she had a low-grade fever. Hours later, she went to the hospital and was diagnosed with Ebola

The plane Ms Vinson flew on when she may have been contagious made four more flights full of passengers before it was removed from service. The plane returned to Cleveland from Dallas, then flew to Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Intentional Airport in Florida, then to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport

'We take today’s events seriously as your safety and that of our customers is always at the forefront of everything we do,' Frontier CEO David Siegel said in an open letter. 

'This was over and above CDC guidance that stated that our flight crews were safe to fly.'

The CDC is trying to track down all passengers who flew on Flight 1143 with Ms Vinson and had asked them to call a government helpline at 1-800-CDC-INFO (1-800-232-4636).

Officials at Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport say they have cleaned and disinfected common areas at the airport after learning Ms Vinson passed through.

Ms Vinson has flown to Cleveland to visit her fiance and her mother and plan her upcoming wedding. 

The CDC criticized her for traveling, though Dallas public health officials said the feds never warned the 76 healthcare workers who treated Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan to stay off airplanes.  

Frontier has also notified passengers aboard five flights that the plane took after Ms Vinson's trip.

Those flights are:
