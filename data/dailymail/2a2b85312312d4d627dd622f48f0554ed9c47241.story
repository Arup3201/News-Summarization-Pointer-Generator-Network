Half a million people in Britain are living with coeliac disease without knowing it, according to new research.

The disease, a digestive condition which leads to an adverse reaction to gluten in foods such as bread and pasta, can lead to a range of other medical problems if it is not diagnosed.

Research by the University of Nottingham has found that only 24 per cent of people with the autoimmune condition are diagnosed.

The rate of diagnosis has increased four-fold in the last two decades, according to the study in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.

Far more needs to be done to identify sufferers said Sarah Sleet, the chief executive of Coeliac UK.

She said: ‘This latest research shows that nearly a quarter of people with coeliac disease have now been diagnosed and gives an up to date picture of the diagnosis levels across the UK.

‘Of course, increasing numbers with a diagnosis is good news and will inevitably mean that there will be an increased demand for gluten-free products in supermarkets.

‘But the three quarters undiagnosed - around 500,000 people - is a shocking statistic that needs urgent action.’

Pasta is delicious for most of us but not if you are a coeliac

Calling for supermarkets to stock at least eight core items of gluten-free food, she added: ‘Can you imagine going into your local supermarket and there is no bread you can eat, not one loaf, not one slice?

‘And when you check out the pasta, cereal or flour again there is nothing available on the shelf which means you have to trawl around two or three stores in order to be able to find your staple foods.

‘This is not about your preferred brand but about the major supermarkets ensuring that they have sufficient stock in all their stores whatever their size for this growing market of people who depend on gluten-free food for their health.’

Coeliac disease affects one in every 100 people in the UK. The only treatment is a life-long gluten-free diet.

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley and rye and can be found in any food containing these cereals including pasta, most types of bread, breakfast cereals, cakes and some other foods.
