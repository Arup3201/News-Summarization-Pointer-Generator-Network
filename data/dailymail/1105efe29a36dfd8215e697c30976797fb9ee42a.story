Rules are increasingly relaxing on people wanting to travel on planes with prescription marijuana.

Recent reports show that those who have recently presented prescription identification at airports in certain states have been allowed to travel without any issues, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML).

‘I think it shows that TSA primarily is acting as it was intended when it was established, to protect all of us when we travel on the airlines and to thwart terrorists. 

Pot on planes?: Reports say travellers bringing medical marijuana on planes have been allowed to travel

Getting through: People travelling with pot have been allowed on planes, as long as they show their marijuana license

Keith Stroup, the founder of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, says people have been allowed to travel with marijuana without any issues

‘It is not supposed to be an anti-drug agency,’ said Keith Stroup, an attorney and founder of NORML, to ABC News.

Twenty states have legalised marijuana for medical purposes and two have given recreational use the green light, which causes some confusion at airports.

The TSA, or Transportation Security Administration, states on its website that local law does not apply to them.

‘Whether or not marijuana is considered 'medical marijuana' under local law is not relevant to TSA screening, because TSA is governed by federal law and federal law provides no basis to treat medical marijuana any differently than non-medical marijuana.’

‘What nobody feels 100 per cent comfortable with is it's a grey zone you're going through. It's technically still illegal even though they aren't enforcing it very strongly,’ Stroup said.

But whether the herbs in question will be turned over to local authorities is at the discretion of the TSA, and historically responses have varied on a case-by-case basis.

Flying with weed: Irvin Rosenfeld smokes medicinal marijuana to help deal with the pain from a bone disease. He says he has flown many times with marijuana

Irvin Rosenfeld, 60, had been prescribed medical marijuana for 19 years for a painful bone disease when he was prevented from boarding a flight in 2001, according to a lawsuit he filed against the Delta Air Lines in March 2003.

The Tamarac stockbroker was set to fly from Fort Lauderdale to Washington, DC, to attend a US Supreme Court hearing on medicinal marijuana when Delta prohibited him from flying with the drug.

Rosenfeld said he alerted Delta that he would be traveling with marijuana when he booked the ticket.

He said Delta had welcomed him to travel with the drug in the past, understanding that he needs it to ease his pain.

At the time, Rosenfeld was one of eight people in the United States legally allowed to use marijuana. 

The suit was dropped in 2002 because a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled that citizens can't file private suits against airlines under the Air Carrier Access Act, created to guarantee access to flights for people with disabilities.

According to the TSA, their screening procedures are governed by federal law.

‘If during the security screening procedures an officer discovers a item that may violate the law, TSA will refer the matter to a law enforcement.

‘Law enforcement officials will determine whether to initiate a criminal investigation. TSA's focus is on terrorism and security threats to the aircraft and its passengers,’ they told ABC News.
