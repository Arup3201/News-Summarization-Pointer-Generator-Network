At least 21 people were reported dead and thousands of homes swept away by Typhoon Hagupit as millions more in the Philippine capital braced themselves for its arrival today.

More than a million people fled their homes as the typhoon approached the country from the Pacific, fearing a repeat of a super storm last year that left more than 7,000 dead or missing.

Most of the dead drowned as flood waters rose in Borongan, the main town in Eastern Samar, where the typhoon made its first landfall, said the Philippine National Red Cross.

In Metro Manila, a coastal megalopolis of 12million that often endures deadly flooding, evacuation efforts were in full swing as forecasters warned of downpours from dusk.

However Hagupit weakened from a typhoon as it moved slowly across the central Philippines, fuelling cautious optimism the disaster-weary nation may avoid another calamity involving hundreds of deaths.

'We are on 24-hour alert for floods and storm surges... it's the flooding that we are worried about,' said Joseph Estrada, mayor of Manila, the original city of two million within Metro Manila.

Thousands of people from the shanty towns perched along Manila's coast and riverbands were crammed into schools and other evacuation centres throughout the city.

Schools were suspended, the stock market closed, office and government workers told to stay at home and dozens of flights cancelled.

President Benigno Aquino led the preparations as part of a massive effort to keep people safe. Last year 7,350 people died when Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated large parts of the central Philippines in November.

Millions of people living in the direct path of Hagupit over the weekend were sent to evacuation centres or ordered to remain in their homes.

The storm was the strongest to hit the Philippines this year, with gusts of up to 130mph when it made landfall on Saturday night.

Thousands of homes were destroyed, power lines were torn down, landslides choked roads, and flood waters up to one storey high flowed through some towns.

Gwendolyn Pang, secretary-general of the Philippine National Red Cross, told Reuters: 'We have confirmed reports that 21 people died in Eastern Samar, 16 of them in Borongan.'

Borongan, capital of Eastern Samar province, is one of the main cities along Samar's east coast that faces the Pacific Ocean and just 30 miles south of where Hagupit struck

Ms Pang said it was impossible to say whether the death toll would climb, with full damage assessments from some areas that were hit yet to come in and the storm still travelling across the country.

Before the reports of the deaths, presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte and other government officials were optimistic that evacuations had saved many lives.

'Preemptive evacuation was carried out and warnings by authorities were taken seriously,' Ms Valte told AFP.

In Tacloban, a city of 220,000 people that was one of the worst-hit during Haiyan, heavy winds destroyed homes but authorities said there were no casualties over the weekend.

'There is a collective sigh of relief... we were better prepared after Yolanda,' Tacloban vice mayor Jerry Yaokasin told AFP on Sunday, referring to Haiyan by its Philippine name.

However just as crucially, Hagupit's winds were significantly weaker than Haiyan, which was the strongest storm ever recorded on land. There was also no repeat of Haiyan's tsunami-like storm surges.

Hagupit's sustained winds dropped to 87mph on Sunday, then continued to weaken after leaving the eastern Philippine islands and passing over the Sibuyan Sea southeast of Manila.

Its winds were down to 68mph on Monday and were expected to weaken further as it passed just south of the capital in the evening, according to local weather agency Pagasa.

However Pagasa said the winds were still capable of doing major damage to homes, and heavy rains were expected within Hagupit's 280-mile-wide weather front.
