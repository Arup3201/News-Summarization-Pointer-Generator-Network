Realtors have given a first look inside the California home where millionaire Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend and six-year-old son died in 2011 - as the lavish property hits the market for $16.9 million.

An investment group is selling the 10-bedroom oceanfront home in Coronado, near San Diego, that was once owned by Shacknai, the CEO and founder of Arizona-based Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp.

Realtors assure that the 12,750 sq. ft. house, known as Spreckels Mansion, has been stripped of its tragic history after undergoing extensive renovations and said they expect a lot of interest.

In July 2011, Shacknai's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau was found bound and hanging from the mansion's balcony two days after Shacknai's son Max was fatally injured after falling down the stairs.

House of horrors: A mansion owned by millionaire Jonah Shacknai - where his son sustained fatal injuries in a fall three days before his girlfriend was found hanged there - is going on sale for $16.9 million

A look inside: These are the first photographs from inside the newly-renovated house since the deaths

Lavish: The Spreckels mansion is a landmark in one of San Diego's most exclusive neighborhoods

Investigators called Max's death an 
accident and Zahau's a suicide, but Max's mother and Zahau's family have
both called the deaths suspicious.

Scott Aurich, of Pacific Sothebyâ€™s International Realty, said the home has received a top-to-bottom renovation, but no changes have been made to the balcony where Zahau was found.

He said that he does not believe prospective buyers will not be put off by its grisly history.

'The people looking to buy this house
think of it as what they can use it for, and how it fits their needs - 
and the location and the opportunity that's here because it's a 
one-of-a-kind asset,' he told San Diego 6.

History: Six-year-old Max fell over the balcony of this staircase and died from his injuries

Fall: The entrance of the home, near to where Max was found at the bottom of the staircase

New look: But realtors say prospective buyers will not be put off by the history as the home has undergone extensive renovations, such as in the master bedroom, which was originally two bedrooms

Stunning: The ocean-side home near San Diego has ten bedroom and nine-and-a-half bathrooms

The renovations were carried out 
after Shacknai entered into a deal with a group of investors, but Aurich
would not disclose the nature of the deal or the people involved.

The updates include a new roof, refurbished wood flooring and improvements to several rooms, including the master bedroom and the kitchen.

There is also a new pool and jacuzzi between the main 
house and the guest house, where Shacknai's brother was staying when he 
found Zahau's body.

Shacknai bought the 10-bedroom, nine-and-a-half bathroom home for $12.75 million in March 2007.

The listing describes the property as 'one of the premier oceanfront beach 
compounds in all of Southern California... overlooking one of the most beautiful beaches in the world!'

The home gets its name from John D. Spreckels, a sugar baron who was once the wealthiest man in San Diego and who financed the home in 1901.

Expensive: The property, which was built in 1091, was bought by a group of investors last year

A steal: Realtors said the property was a bargain as the land itself is nearly worth as much as the asking price

Addition: A swimming pool and jacuzzi have been added between the house and guest house - where Shacknai's brother was staying when he found the body of Rebecca in July 2011

Lavish: The oceanfront, historic home near San Diego has 10 bedrooms and 9-and-a-half bathrooms

The mansion hit headlines two years ago for the deaths, which have been deemed suspicious by family members of the deceased.

Max
Shacknai's mother Dina Shacknai, who had a turbulent relationship with 
his father, was so unconvinced that her son's death was an accident that
she hired her own team of investigators.

They reported that her son's death was not an accident.

'He
was a victim of assault and a victim of homicide,' Dina Shacknai told 
NBC News last August. 'Even though nothing will bring my only child 
Maxie back, I owe it to him, as his mother, to make sure the true facts 
of his death are known.'

The official police investigation into the death of Max found that the boy tumbled over a railing and fell down the stairs.

The
little boy is said to have hit the carpeted floor face first which 
fractured his forehead and when paramedics arrived he was not breathing 
and did not have a pulse.

Tragic: Max Shacknai, six, died after he fell 
down the stairs at the home. Days later, Rebecca Zahau, the girlfriend 
of Max's father, was found bound and hanged from an outside balcony at 
the mansion

Loss: Zahau was dating millionaire businessman Jonah Shacknai (pictured together), who owned the home

Questions: Max's mother, Dina Shacknai, hired investigators who said he had been assaulted and killed

He died one week later at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.

Max Shacknai was in the care of his father's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau at the time of his death, but her family members said it was 'preposterous' she would be involved in his death.

Zahau was found by Jonah Shacknai hanging from an outside balcony at the home days after Max's tragic fall. She was naked, gagged and her hands and feet bound.

Zahau's family has also commissioned their own private investigation. Her sister said she spoke with her the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she planned to take her life.
