Dave Whelan has warned he will resign as chairman of Wigan if the Football Association punishes him for the controversy which has seen him labelled 'a racist' by Cardiff owner Vincent Tan.

The FA has said its investigation into Whelan's comments about Jewish and Chinese people will be treated 'as a priority'.

They have written to the 77-year-old - who cried when Wigan fans sang his name on Saturday - to seek his take on events.

Whelan spoke out in a newspaper interview where he was defending his decision to hire former Cardiff boss Malky Mackay and has since apologised.

Mackay was recruited by Wigan despite being under investigation by the FA for allegedly sending racist and anti-semitic texts, and Whelan responded to criticism by telling The Guardian: 'I think Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else.'

He also said he did not view the word 'chink' - the term by which Mackay allegedly referred to Tan in a text message - as offensive.

Whelan told ITV News: 'If the FA look into my affairs - and they were to find me guilty, which I hope they don't and I don't see anything like that happening because I'm absolutely anti-racist, always have been, always will be - however, if they have any questions I'm willing to answer it and, should they even suggest I'm guilty I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic.'

During Saturday's match with Middlesbrough at the DW Stadium, Whelan was seen to break down in tears as he was widely applauded by the Wigan supporters, with the crowd signing: 'There's only one Dave Whelan'. 

David Cameron has been urged by a Labour MP to give Whelan's donation to the Conservative Party of £1.5million to charity in light of the Wigan owner's 'anti-Semitic and racist' remarks.

Labour MP Karl Turner has written to the prime minister to suggest it would be more fitting the money Whelan has given to the Tories since 2007 be distributed to charities.

Turner calls on Cameron to 'personally condone or condemn' the 77-year-old's comments, with Whelan's most recent contribution £100,000 in August 2014. 

Whelan, 77, caused a stir over his appointment of Mackay as the new Wigan manager earlier this week

He says: 'Given his status as a significant contributor to your re-election efforts you must now make it clear if you personally condone or condemn these comments.

'I hope that you agree with me that these anti-Semitic and racist comments have no place in modern British society, and as such I hope that you also agree with me that you must now give up any money that you have received from Mr Whelan and consider which charitable groups would be better recipients of it.

'Failure to act swiftly in this matter will show a lack of leadership. It will not be possible for you to simultaneously condemn offensive remarks while accepting large sums of money from those responsible for them.'

Wigan have lost their back-of-shirt sponsor Premier Range following the controversial appointment of Mackay.

The local kitchen firm, which carries a logo on the back of the Championship club side's kit, said that it had been left in an 'untenable position'.
