Halloween is here, and ahead of this weekend's action we've got a team full of tricks, treats and scorers of the greatest ghouls ever seen.

From the scariest man in Premier League history to one of the deadliest strikers, here's your Halloween XI from across football. Enjoy...

Manager

Louis van Ghoul

Brought in to strike fear into a depleted Manchester United side in the summer, Van Ghoul comes across as a character up front, but behind the scenes has no doubt given his players the hairdryer in the last couple of months.

Goalkeeper

Dead de Goey

A giant between the sticks for Chelsea, the Dutchman played 175 times for the club and picked up 31 caps for his country. 

Ed de Goey was 6ft 6in... a towering goalkeeper and Chelsea's No 1 for three seasons

Defenders 

John Ceme-Terry

Another scary Chelsea player, the legendary Blue hasn't been consigned to the Premier League cemetery yet. The 33-year-old made his 500th appearance as captain recently, and has plenty more in the locker.

Martin Scare-tel

Fully tattooed and deadly from set pieces in the penalty area, the Slovakian scored seven goals for Liverpool last season, but is yet to find the net this term.

Martin Skrtel is a demon in both penalty areas, but has struggled for form with Liverpool this term

Gary Devil

The right-back turned pundit is a Red Devil through and through, vocalising his support and criticism for Manchester United in equal measure having made 602 appearances for the club.

Gary Neville always liked a laugh, and was a Red Devil at heart after 19 years at the club

Gremlin Hughes

An England and Liverpool legend, the defender died in 2004 having represented the Three Lions 62 times. He won four league titles and two European Cups.

Midfielders

Bat Le Tissier

Scorer of frighteningly fantastic goals, he didn't look too scary on the ball, but the Jersey-born maverick had his own goal of the season competition every year. 

Matt Le Tissier was a scorer of fantastic goals for Southampton, but only played for England eight times

Charles N'Zombie-a

If Le Tissier was frighteningly good, Charles N'Zogbia is frighteningly inconsistent. Coined 'Charlie Insomnia' by Joe Kinnear, the midfielder has struggled for form since moving to Aston Villa from Wigan in 2011.

Frankenstein Lampard

Another Chelsea legend, Lampard came back to haunt his former team-mates by scoring in the 1-1 draw with new club Manchester City last month.

Roy Pump-Keane 

The scariest man in football without a costume, Keane's recent book release struck fear into one or two former team-mates. The midfielder is now Aston Villa and Republic of Ireland No 2. 

Roy Keane is one of the scariest characters in the game, and his book struck fear into a few old pals

Strikers

Robin Vampire-sie

The Dutchman hasn't been deadly in front of goal in recent months, but his finish on Sunday against Chelsea came as a huge relief.

Ian Fright

One of the nicest men in football on a Halloween XI, the striker scored 314 goals in a 15-year career.

Ian Wright was deadly in front of goal at Palace, Arsenal, West Ham, Forest, Celtic, Burnley and England
