A time-lapse video captures thousands of planes jetting into Dubai International Airport in the space of 24 hours.

The footage, which is shot in the shape of a ‘little planet’, shows a 360-degree panoramic view of the main airline hub in the Middle East.

There are more than 7,000 weekly flights, operated by 140 airlines, to more than 230 destinations, making for a busy video as planes fly in and out all through the night.

A spokesperson for Dubai360, who created the video, said: ‘If you watch carefully you will notice that the little planet actually makes exactly one rotation over 24 hours of real time.

‘Terminal 3 at the airport acts as an hour hand on a 24-hour clock, with midnight at the top, and midday at the bottom, so you can tell exactly what time every single frame was taken.’

The video is part of a new project which will allow people across the world to have 360-degree virtual tours of Dubai’s tourist landmarks and attractions.

Shaikh Hamdan Bin Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, announced the upcoming launch via his Instagram and Twitter accounts.

He posted: ‘Soon we will launch Dubai360.com, the world’s leading immersive virtual city tour. It’s a pioneering website that will enable the world to explore Dubai anytime and anywhere.’

The fascinating footage was shot with four perfectly synchronized Canon 1Dx cameras using Canon EF 8-15mm f4 L USM fish-eye zooms.

More than 88,000 photographs were taken and used to create 24 hours’ worth of time-lapses.The photographs were then stitched using Kolor Autopano Video into 22,000 separate panoramas.
