Falling wages may delay any rise in interest rates, the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney suggested today.

Mr Carney revealed he would place ‘particular importance’ on workers’ wages picking up when considering whether or not to increase rates from their historic low of 0.5 per cent.

The remarks, which came after the Office for National Statistics revealed wages had fallen for the first time in five years in the three months to June, suggest there may not be any interest rate increase until just before the next election.

Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney suggested interest rates would not rise in the near future following disappointing wage growth

The Bank of England this morning downgraded its forecast for average wage increases this year - from 2.5% to just 1.25%.

Mr Carney said ‘pay growth has been remarkably weak’ in Britain, but insisted there was ‘no magic number’ that would trigger an interest rate rise.

When the Bank does start increasing its interest rates, it will do so in a ‘small, slow’ manner, said Mr Carney added.

Despite stagnating wages, the Bank upped its forecast for economic growth this year 3.4 per cent to 3.5 per cent.

‘Sustained economic momentum is looking more assured’, Mr Carney said. ‘The economy is returning to a semblance of normality.’

Mr Carney also revealed that the Bank of England is making contingency plans in the event of a Scottish vote to leave the United Kingdom.

He told reporters that the Bank had plans in place for ‘various possibilities’ and conceded that questions about the future for Scotland's currency could affect financial stability.

He said: ‘It is never a good idea to talk about contingency plans in public other than to assure people we have contingency plans." But he added: "We don't get a vote on this and we don't want a vote on this.’

Labour said Mr Carney’s remarks showed the people were still struggling despite the economic recovery.

Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said: ‘This report shows why this is no time for complacent and out-of-touch claims from ministers that the economy is fixed and people are better off.

‘While the economy is finally growing again and unemployment is falling, working people are still seeing their living standards squeezed.

‘Pay growth is at a record low and lagging behind inflation and the Bank of England has halved its forecasts for wage growth this year.’

Economists now expect the first interest rate rise to come in February next year, just a few months before the general election.

Markit chief economist Chris Williamson said: ‘The report and recent rhetoric from policy-makers gives the impression that rates will not rise until wage growth is showing clear signs of picking up.’
