Andy Murray seemed in a relaxed mood on Sunday afternoon as he was put through his paces by new coach Amelie Mauresmo.

The pair were all smiles during the training session as the Wimbledon reigning champion prepares for his match against Kevin Anderson on Monday.Â 

Mauresmo certainly seemed to be working Murray hard as the Scot was drenched in sweat, but she still found time for a joke while out on the court.

Murray, who also enjoyed a mixed doubles practice match with Mauresmo, will have to be at his best on Monday when he takes on the 20th-seeded South African Anderson in the last 16.

At 6ft 8in, it is no surprise that Anderson's serve offers a big threat on grass in particular. But the 28-year-old is no mug from the back of the court and is enjoying the best season of his career.

He and Murray have played twice before, with the Scot winning easily at the Australian Open in 2010 and Anderson doing the same a year later in Canada.

Murray certainly has the edge on experience given Anderson has never been beyond the fourth round at any slam.

Speaking ahead of the match, Murray said: 'It will be a tough match.'

'He's a big guy with a big game. He's played some very good tennis this year.

'It's probably been his best year on the tour so far in terms of consistency. I'll need to play a tough match to beat him.'
