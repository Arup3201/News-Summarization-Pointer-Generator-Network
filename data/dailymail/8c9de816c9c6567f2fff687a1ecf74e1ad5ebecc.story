Holiday retail workers watch out. Crazed bargain hunters are already lining up for Black Friday deals at commercial stores.

Best Buy shoppers in California have started pitching tents outside several store locations, more than 100 hours before the company’s big holiday sale begins.

Shoppers in Arizona are also getting an early start in line, equipped with soda, water, snacks, laptops and air mattresses.

One customer who only works weekends told a local reporter that he expects to 'make' between $4 and $5 an hour waiting for a 40-inch flat-screen television that Best Buy is selling for $180 during its sale.

In addition to the direct savings, some are doing it for the thrill, Fox10 in Phoenix, Arizona, reports.

‘We like being number one,’ Angela Gransberry, an eager customer waiting outside of a nearby Best Buy, told a reporter.

Tony Avitar, an Ohio father-of-five, set up base outside of a Best Buy in Cuyahoga Falls last Thursday.

He said he has camped out for Black Friday deals over the past nine years, and that his family will join him in his tent on Thanksgiving for a family meal.

'When you have five kids and you have limited income what you want to be able to do is provide for them and get them decent Christmas presents,' he told Fox8 in Cleveland, Ohio.

The flood of bargain hunters could mean an even bigger headache for holiday workers this year.

Retail employees recently began protesting the earlier shifts they were given this Black Friday as several chain stores have decided to open earlier than previous years.

Target, Walmart, Sears and Toys ‘R’ Us are all opening their doors between 8 and 9pm this Thanksgiving, two to four hours earlier than last year.

That news led to the organization of a national Black Friday walkout among Walmart workers and more than 40 petitions on Change.org protesting this year's Thanksgiving shifts at several big chain retailers.
