Stan Wawrinka moved another step closer to defending his Australian Open title as the Swiss booked his place in the semi-finals on Wednesday.

Wawrinka dominated throughout but almost suffered a collapse in the third-set tiebreak before beating Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6).

The fourth seed said: 'I'm still nervous from the end of the tiebreak. I started really well. It's never easy and you have to go for it.

'I am happy to get through. So far I am playing well. I am so happy to be back in the semi-finals.'

Wawrinka made a strong start, controlling play from the baseline, and he sealed the first set in 30 minutes as Nishikori hit long.

Wawrinka continued to attack but had to save three break points when serving for the second set at 5-4 before taking a two-set lead when Nishikori dumped a backhand into the net.

Nishikori sparked Japanese hopes of a comeback by breaking at the start of the third set but the fifth seed could not hold on to it as the set went to a tiebreak.

Wawrinka brought up five match points at 6-1 and got tight as he failed to convert any of them but a poor drop shot from Nishikori gave Wawrinka a sixth and he took it with an ace down the middle.

The 29-year-old now awaits the winner of Wednesday night's final quarter-final between world No 1 Novak Djokovic and big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic.
