For the residents of a sleepy upstate New York town, the Christmas film It's a Wonderful Life has a special place in their hearts.

Those living in Seneca Falls believe their homely town, with its steel truss bridge and broad main street, is where Frank Capra based his classic film.

And, while a direct connection between the director and the town can't be confirmed, it doesn't stop its 9,000 residents celebrating the movie every Christmas.

Christmas classic: Every year residents of Seneca Falls dress up as characters from It's a Wonderful Life and parade through their town

Those in Seneca Falls believe George Bailey's fictional hometown of Bedford Falls was heavily inspired by their own town.

Seneca Falls in New York claims to have been the inspiration for Capra's 1946 film.

The town has similar features to the fictional Bedford Falls, including a steel truss bridge, broad Main Street, and railroad station.

Characters in the film also refer to nearby towns such as Rochester and Elmira.

Local barber Tommy Bellissima is believed to have cut Frank Capra's hair when the director passed through the town in 1945.

In 1917, Seneca Falls resident Antonio Varacalli saved a woman's life after she jumped from the town's bridge - an act seemingly reflected in the 1946 film.

A plaque commemorates Varacalli, who died after getting the woman to safety. Each year bells are run in the town to remember him as 'an angel who got his wings'.

Seneca Falls holds a weekend celebration based around the classic film every December.

Every year, members of the community dress as characters including Clarence the Angel and mean Mr Potter, for a parade down the Main Street.

They even mark the end of the festival with a ringing of the bells in memory of Antonio Varacalli, who saved a woman's life in 1917, and to honor 'angels' nominated by current residents.

'Capra always said Bedford Falls represented little slices of small towns that he had visited all across America. We're not in a position to dispute that,' Francis Caraccilo, a trustee for the town's It's a Wonderful Life Museum, said. 'We just think we're a bigger slice.'

While there's no definitive proof 
that Capra ever set foot in Seneca Falls, local barber Tommy Bellissima 
claimed he cut the director's hair in 1945, as he passed through on his 
way to visit an aunt.

Mr Bellissima,
 who died in 2011, didn't initially know the customer he chatted with 
was famous, but the surname Capra stuck in his head because it means 
'goat' in Italian.

The 1946 film starred Jimmy Stewart as Bailey, a small-town, frustrated banker who realizes his life's value after Clarence shows him what would become of Bedford Falls if he had never been born.

The homey town falls into the clutches of the greedy slumlord Potter, and his Pottersville becomes a city of sin, with sleazy nightclubs, burlesque halls, pawn shops and neon lights.

If Bedford Falls - the nice one, not the naughty one - really was modeled after Seneca Falls, Capra never let on before his death in 1991.

But there are striking similarities. Seneca Falls has a broad main street like Bedford Falls, and its bridge has a plaque dedicated to a man who lost his life by diving in after a suicidal woman in 1917 - an act echoed in the film.

Karolyn Grimes, who played Bailey's daughter Zuzu in the movie and is a festival regular, said the similarities were so striking that she blurted out 'It's Bedford Falls!' during her first visit.

The film also has references to nearby upstate cities. The bank examiner wants to get back to his family in Elmira for Christmas. George's wealthy friend Sam Wainwright talks of building a factory outside Rochester, and his brother is offered a job in Buffalo.

Bedford Falls also has a Genesee Street. The word "genesee" is from the Iroquois and is closely associated with the Finger Lakes region that includes Seneca Falls.

Perhaps fitting for a Christmas story, the contention that Seneca Falls is the real Bedford Falls comes down to belief.

'There just is no evidence to support it, but God bless them,' Jeanine Basinger, curator of the Frank Capra Archive at Wesleyan University and author of The It's a Wonderful Life Book, said.

Ms Basinger said Capra was a meticulous record keeper, yet she has never come across the link in his records, diary entries or script notes - not to mention the many conversations she had with Capra over years.

'I hate being in the role of Mr Potter. I'm sorry, everybody. I wish I could say: "Eureka! And here it is!" But the fact is there is absolutely no evidence to confirm this,' she said.

It's also possible that Capra might have known of Bedford Hills, a hamlet in the moneyed community of Bedford (think Sam Wainwright) north of New York City.

But Evelyne Ryan, executive director of the Bedford Historical Society, said that the place is not similar to Bedford Falls and that a case has never been seriously made.

It's also possible Bedford Falls was meant to be an ideal, not a place. Ms Basinger noted that the great thing about It's a Wonderful Life is that everyone feels it's their hometown. And that's just fine to some Seneca Falls partisans.

'We're OK not having proof. In fact, maybe having a little mystery behind it makes it even better,' Mr Caraccilo said. 'Keeps the magic going.'
