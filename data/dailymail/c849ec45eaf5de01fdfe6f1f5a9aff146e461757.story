He is clearly keen to find a way to spice up his stodgy public image. But having a ‘Geri Halliwell moment’ was perhaps not what Ed Miliband had in mind.

The Labour leader was photographed yesterday taking the London Underground, just as former Spice Girl Miss Halliwell had been the day before.

Mr Miliband – fresh from being labelled a champagne socialist during Prime Minister’s Questions 24 hours earlier – was on the Tube with Labour MP Dame Tessa Jowell.

Spooked: Labour leader Ed Miliband looks uncomfortable as he takes the tube back to Westminster after delivering a speech on banking

The pair were returning to 
Westminster following a meeting with business owners in Brixton, south 
London, where they were joined by Labour’s business spokesman Chuka 
Umunna.

Mr Miliband 
and Dame Tessa were seen laughing and joking with commuters who appeared
pleased, if a little surprised, to see him in their midst.

Slumming it: Geri Halliwell took the Tube yesterday and expressed her excitement on Twitter

The
Labour leader did his best to look nonchalant – and at least he stayed 
awake, unlike his elder brother David, who was caught out by fellow 
passengers in January when he fell asleep on the Tube with his flies 
open.

But Tube photo-opportunities are not without their peril, as Miss Halliwell found.

She
faced a Twitter backlash after she stunned commuters by tweeting her 
top tips for taking the underground – following her first Tube trip in 
17 years, a journey that lasted all of one stop.

Earlier he used a speech to business leaders to set out a plan for a
new network of lenders which would only funnel money to people and 
businesses in their area.

He said up to 20 new regional banks would be 
created by a Labour government to herald a return to old-fashioned local
lending.

He attacked high street banking giants who too often say 'no' to customers, and promised new 'banks you can come to trust'.

But banking groups said they had already increased the number of local bank managers taking decisions on lending to business.

Lending to small firms has collapsed in 
recent months, leading critics to accuse the big taxpayer funded banks 
of ‘stabbing businesses in the back’.

Bank
of England figures last month revealed net lending - the amount banks 
lend compared to money repaid by customers - was negative at minus 
£1.5billion.

Smart casual: Mr Miliband tries to look relaxed but risks the doors banging him on the head

Chewing things over: Mr Miliband was joined by shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna and local MP Tessa Jowell to meet diners in Brixton Village in south London today

This is despite the launch of an £80billion scheme by the Bank and the Treasury last August aimed specifically at solving the country’s small business and mortgage lending crisis.

The Daily Mail’s ‘Make the Banks Lend’ campaign was launched in July 2010 to highlight the problems facing small businesses.

Labour say the regional banks would leverage private sector funding but may also require an injection of public money. They are provisionally called ‘Sparks’ - as they are modelled on regional banks in Germany called sparkassen.

Awkward: Mr Miliband did not look comfortable as he left a cafe in Brixton

Hats off: The Labour leader toured shops and met market stall holders to discuss his plans for new local banks

Mr Miliband told to the British Chambers of Commerce: ‘The regional banks being proposed will be committed to their regions and in touch with local business, making it easier for firms to secure the capital investment they need so they can create the jobs and growth Britain needs.’

He said he had heard from countless businesses refused legitimate finance by 'banks that don't know your businesses or who don't seem to care'.

'Nothing the government has done has made a difference. Net lending fell by £4.5 billion in the last quarter while the big banks carry on with a bonus as usual culture.

'It is time to recognise that tinkering will not sort this out. Britain needs a wholly new banking system.'

However, today Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused Labour of letting the banks 'get away with blue murder' before the 2008 financial crash.

He told LBC 97.3: 'It was Liberal Democrats who week in, week out said to Gordon Brown and Ed Balls “Don’t go off on your prawn cocktail charm offensive in the City of London.”  

'Which was what Ed Balls was doing at the time; basically sucking up to the banks and letting them get away with all that nonsense.

'They left the cupboard bare, they let the banks run amuck and I find it quite remarkable how little contrition we hear from Ed Balls and Ed Miliband, they still haven’t acknowledged their responsibility in creating the mess in the first place.'.

Mr Miliband said next week's Budget had to focus on helping firms to succeed

Labour already had plans to create a British Investment Bank, but Mr Miliband said he would go further.

'We don't just need a single Investment Bank serving the country. We need a regional banking system, serving each and every region of the country.

'Regional banks with a mission to serve that region and that region alone. Not banks that like to say 'no', but banks that know your region and your business. Not banks that you mistrust, but banks you can come to trust.

'I am committed to turning that idea 
into reality during the next government because I am determined that One
Nation Labour becomes the party of the small business and the 
entrepreneur as together we create a recovery made by the many and built
to last.'

Lord Oakeshott, a
Lib Dem peer who resigned in 2011 after criticising Project Merlin - a 
previous Government attempt to help small firms - gave the scheme a 
cautious welcome.

Mr Miliband wants to see a return to 'old fashioned' bank managers, like Captain Mainwaring in BBC TV's Dad's Army

He said yesterday: ‘All ideas to make banks lend are welcome and this is a sensible idea to increase long term lending.

‘But it will take a long time to build a network of regional banks and the key challenge in the short-term is how to make the state-owned banks RBS and Lloyds lend as they represent 60 per cent of the market and they are failing the nation. That is now the biggest challenge facing the Government.’

The Federation of Small Business said regional banks had been proposed before and they had to examine the details to see if they could work in Britain.

Mr Miliband said small and medium sized firms ‘are the backbone of the British economy’ but keep being turned down for lending.

The new banks would be regional partners in a British Investment Bank which is already underway.

He will also outline the need for infrastructure projects such as a airports and railways.

Addressing next week's Budget, Mr 
Miliband added: 'You've been telling us for so long that the way we 
resource and plan our infrastructure in Britain is not good enough. We must tackle this.

'That's why, when our construction sector is still flat on its back, One
Nation Labour would be advancing investment in infrastructure.'

He aid the Budget needed to 'raise our sights to the big challenges that our country has faced for decades'.

'To succeed, we don't just need immediate measures: we need to build new
institutions out of the rubble of the old with radical new approaches 
to banking, skills, the British firm and infrastructure, underpinned by 
confidence and clarity about our place in the world.'
