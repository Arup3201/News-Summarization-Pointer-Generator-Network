The father of a young woman from Alaska who was shot dead last month urged a court to keep her boyfriend in jail.

Butch Moore addressed the court when Joshua Almeda made his first appearance, just two days after the shooting, to face charges of murdering Breanna.

Miss Moore, 20, was shot in the head while staying with Almeda, 22, at his parents' home on June 26.

Victim: Breanna Moore was shot dead while staying at her boyfriend's house in June

Suspect: Joshua Almeda, pictured at a hearing just two days after the shooting, was indicted on murder charges this week

He appeared in court again this week to be indicted for murder and misconduct involving a weapon.

At his first appearance just days after Miss Moore's death, Almeda had sat passively in court while the victim's father described her murder as an 'execution' and called Almeda a 'violent criminal'.

'There's no question with the information that I have from the police, there was nothing more than an execution,' Mr Moore told the court, according to KTUU.

Managing to keep his voice steady, the grieving father said his daughter had devoted all her time to Almeda.

'Everything she did was for Joshua. She was always with him,' Mr Moore said.

Popular: Breanna, 20, had played on her high school volleyball team and volunteered at a cat sanctuary

The dental assistant, who also volunteered at a cat sanctuary, was found dead on a bed by Almeda's mother, Shannon.

Mrs Almeda allegedly told police she heard screaming and when she checked on her son and his girlfriend she found Miss Moore had been killed.

The mom hid the gun from her son, and called police.

According to Alaska Dispatch News, Almeda claimed to have been brushing his teeth in the bathroom when he heard a bang, and found Miss Moore dead.

In a probable cause statement Detective Monique Doll wrote: 'Initial crime scene analysis indicates the physical evidence at the scene was not consistent with suicide.'

Hard-working: After graduating high school, Breanna had started work as a dental assistant

Friends of Miss Moore, who had played on her high school's varsity volley ball team, gathered to pay tribute to the young woman the day after she died.

Almeda had his bail set at $1.5 million as the judge ruled he was 'a significant threat to the community.'

If he is found guilty, Almeda faces a sentence of up to 99 years in prison.
