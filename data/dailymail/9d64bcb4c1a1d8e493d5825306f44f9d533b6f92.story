Alan Pardew is expected to be at Villa Park for Crystal Palace's opening Premier League match of 2015 as he edges closer to being named the next Eagles boss.

Sportsmail understands an official announcement that Pardew has signed on as manager could be made before Palace's match with Aston Villa.

And the former Palace midfielder is still expected to complete his Selhurst Park homecoming, but not in time to take charge of the New Year's Day trip.

Newcastle United manager Pardew had hoped to complete his Eagles switch from Newcastle United and oversee the first Premier League clash of the year, but Keith Millen will remain in caretaker charge instead.

All of the details have been resolved in Pardew's negotiations with Palace and an official announcement is expected imminently.

The former Palace midfielder met with the club's coaching staff on Wednesday evening and is expected to be at Villa Park on New Year's Day.  

Palace sacked Neil Warnock on December 27 following a run of just one win in 12 games; the Eagles remain in the Premier League's relegation zone after Sunday's goalless draw at QPR.

Palace chief Parish had always envisaged Millen taking charge for the Villa trip even if the Pardew deal was complete, so the Selhurst Park bosses are not concerned by any hiatus.

Croydon-born Millen will remain as part of Pardew's backroom staff despite once again pressing for the full-time managerial role.

The former Bristol City boss said he is content to stay at his hometown club, and bide his time for a return to frontline management.

'I want to manage again, without a doubt,' he said.

'But I'm patient at the moment because I enjoying working at Crystal Palace.

'As long as someone comes in, sees what you're about and values you, I'm happy.'

Newcastle face managerial limbo until Pardew's Palace move is signed and sealed.

John Carver has assumed caretaker charge for the next two matches while the club seek Pardew's replacement, with Steve Stone and Peter Beardsley also on hand.

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has tasked managing director Lee Charnley with identifying a head coach to replace Pardew, with chief scout Graham Carr retaining control of recruitment.

Carver has invoked the spirit of the late Sir Bobby Robson, under whose reign the 49-year-old worked on Tyneside.

'For some reason, I started reading Sir Bobby's autobiography last night,' said Carver.

'There was a message on the front of the book - 'Thanks for a fantastic, successful five years, it should have been a lot longer. Cheers, Sir Bobby'.

'When he gave me that book, he said to me, 'You do realise how big this football club is, and if ever you get an opportunity, don't be scared of it, enjoy it and take it with both hands'. So I am sitting here now and I'm going to take it with both hands.'
