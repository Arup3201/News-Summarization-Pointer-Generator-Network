Holidaymakers travelling to Cyprus could be turned away at the airport by budget airline easyJet if their passports are due to expire within the next three months - despite UK and Cypriot authorities insisting that their passports are still valid for travel.

The airline is telling passengers flying to Paphos and Larnaca that they must have at least three months left to run on their passport or they won't be able to fly.

But EU regulations say that a passport is valid for travel right up until the day of expiry.

No go: Passengers flying to Cyprus with easyJet could be refused boarding unless their passport has three months left to run

According to The Independent, 32-year-old charity executive Jonathan Rickard was told he couldn't board an easyJet plane at Gatwick Airport for a flight to Larnaca to attend a wedding.

Ground staff refused to let him fly because his passport expires on August 14 - in eight weeks time.

Valid: Passports are valid for travel within the EU right up until the date they expire

The airline is now refusing to refund his ticket which cost almost Â£300.

He told the newspaper: 'I felt gobsmacked that I was being forced to walk away from a holiday I had planned for months.'

Both Foreign Office guidelines for travel to Cyprus and the Cyprus Tourist organisation confirm that Mr Rickard's documentation should have been valid for him to leave the UK and enter Cyprus with no issue.

The airline however is standing by its three month rule.

It said in a statement: 'Entry requirements can and do change regularly and differ considerably by the nationality of the arriving passenger.

'Ultimately, it is the individual passenger's responsibility to ensure that their travel documentation is valid for the country to which they are flying.'

Passports are also valid to many non EU countries within Europe until the day they expire and to the US so long as a special visa or 'Esta' is obtained.

Other countries, such as Egypt and Thailand impose a six month minimum on a passport.

Since MailOnline published this story, easyJet have issued a new statement admitting that they were wrong to deny Mr Rickard a seat on the plane.

A spokesman said that passengers flying to Cyprus will be able to board their flight with less than three months left to run on their passport after all.

He said: 'Unfortunately easyJet made an error in Mr Rickard's case and so would like to apologise that he was unable to travel. We will be contacting the passenger directly to remedy the situation.'
