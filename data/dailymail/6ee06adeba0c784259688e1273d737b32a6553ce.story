Top security experts have warned travelers that a terrorist attack at the Sochi Winter Olympics is 'very likely'.

The Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said that the U.S. has deployed two American warships to stand guard in the Black Sea during the Games, which start next weekend, in case they are needed to help evacuate Americans.

The threat of a terrorist attack is being viewed as a very real possibility as Russian security forces are hunting a woman suspected of planning a suicide bombing- and she is thought to be in Sochi already.

High alert: Russian Cossacks stand guard near the Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort in Krasnaya Polyana near Sochi. British intelligence chiefs say the 37,000 extra soldiers and police that have been drafted in to boost security have formed a 'ring of steel' around the event

Still, it is far from clear that Russia would allow U.S. military assets into its territory following a security incident, and Moscow has made no request for U.S. security assistance so far.

The focus of the Sochi Winter Games and Paralympic Games will inevitably be on the 230 athletes who will be competing, but they represent just a fraction of the Americans who will be in Russia.

There are expected to be 270 coaches and support staff who will accompany the athletes, and a far bigger number of fans in the crowds.

Up to 10,000 spectators are expected to fill the bleachers, putting the best estimate for Americans in Sochi somewhere around 10,600.

Asked about the matter at a Pentagon news conference, Hagel said only that proper arrangements would be in place, without saying specifically who might do the evacuating.

'If we need to extract our citizens, we will have appropriate arrangements with the Russians to do this,' Hagel said on Friday.

The State Department also issued a travel alert for Americans planning on attending the Games, but it extends throughout the Russian Federation and not simply to Sochi.

'Large-scale public events such as the
 Olympics present an attractive target for terrorists, and the U.S. 
government continues to monitor reported threats of potential terrorist 
attacks in Sochi or in Russia in general,' the alert reads.

Americans
 who decide to travel to Russia between the start of the Games between 
February 7 and March 16 'should remain attentive regarding their 
personal security at all times'.

British intelligence have said that some reassurance can come from the reports that an extra 37,000 soldiers and police officers that have been called in to Sochi in order to boost security have formed a 'ring of steel' around the event, making it a much harder target.

Many American commentators- from former CIA deputy director Michael Morell to former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney- have expressed caution but said that they would still go and bring their families.

Mr Morell, the former CIA deputy director, agreed and urged Americans to take care- particularly when they leave the Olympic village.

'I think the venue itself is fairly safe. I'd worry about airports elsewhere in Russia, I'd worry about Western hotels elsewhere in Russia,' he said on CBS This Morning.

Back up plan: Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Friday that the US will have a contingency plan to get the Americans out should an attack occur

Russian president Vladimir Putin, seen in this file photo, told ABC that Russia will do 'whatever it takes' to make the Sochi Games secure. An expected 80,000 troops are to be on guard

'I think these are the most dangerous Olympics that I've experienced in my adult life... because you have a capable, dedicated, determined terrorist group that has been around for a long time that recently conducted two attacks in Russia that say that they want to attack during the Games.

'I would go. I would take my family. I would be very careful. I would be very aware of my surroundings.'

Mr Romney, who organized the Winter Games in Salt Lake City in 2002, told The Today Show last week that the fact that the Russian organizers have released the names and photos of suspected terrorists who may be plotting an attack shows that they have an 'extraordinary intelligence' program.

‘There's never been a Games that I know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you're seeing at Sochi. At the same time, the level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level,’ Mr Romney said.

‘I believe the Games will be safe. That doesn’t mean there’s a 100 per cent guarantee anywhere in the world today. But this is, after all, a dangerous corner of the world.

A twin bomb attack on the city of Volgograd in December killed 34 people before a militant Islamist group- based in Dagestan- claimed responsibility.
