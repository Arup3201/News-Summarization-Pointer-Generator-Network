A woman has admitted neglecting a foal which has since been re-homed by Olympic dressage star Charlotte Dujardin.

Lisa Fletcher, 47, was banned for keeping horses in October last year, after pleading guilty to three counts of neglecting a grey Arab stallion.

But despite the ban, Fletcher, of Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, secretly kept two young horses in squalid conditions at another yard nearby.

Stroud Magistrates' Court heard Fletcher's deception was uncovered when the RSPCA were alerted to the horses by a member of the public.

Both horses - a seven-month-old black foal and a bay colt estimated to be about two years old - were severely emaciated.

Fletcher today admitted two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to two horses and one count of breaching a disqualification order banning her from keeping the animals.

Julia Hurrel, chair of the bench, told Fletcher the offences fell into the most serious category, level three, and required a minimum 18 week prison sentence.

'It comes into the third level and that's because of the length of the neglect and the fact that these horses were hidden from the RSPCA and your previous sentence,' Ms Hurrel said.

Fletcher was banned from keeping horses for five years and sentenced to a community order at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on October 1 last year.

While that case was under investigation, Fletcher acquired further horses, including the bay colt and black foal, which is now in the care of Ms Dujardin.

On December 3, RSPCA inspector Suzi Smith was called to the DIY livery yard - where Fletcher was responsible for the full care of her horses - after the landlord raised concerns.

Prosecuting, Rafe Turner said Ms Smith, who attended with a vet, found the horses stood in a yard with dirty water and an empty bucket by them.

'The foal was so emaciated that the body condition score was 0.5, not even one, where one is emaciated and five is obese. The colt had a body score of 1.5,' Mr Turner said.

The animals were immediately seized and vets began intensive treatment to save them - with the foal requiring antibiotic injections twice a day for a severe lung infection.

'The period of suffering commenced within a very, very short space of time of the order actually being imposed by the court,' Mr Turner added.

'It is the most obvious and flagrant disregard of a court order in a very short space of time.'

Mr Turner said the horses had little straw in their stables, which were strewn with faeces, and dirty water.

In interview, Fletcher claimed she fed the horses a bale of hay every day from a local farmer but could not afford to give them more.

'When asked about the condition of the black foal on December 3, she replied "probably a bit ribby",' Mr Turner said.

'That's entirely understating it.'

Representing Fletcher, Nicola Colwill said her client, who lives with her father and brother, had tried to re-home the horses after the court order.

'She said she advertised, she asked around but couldn't find homes for them,' Ms Colwill said.

'She was desperately frightened of the situation coming to light because she knew she was in deep trouble when it did.'

Speaking after the hearing, Inspector Smith said the black foal had experienced a 'rags to riches' story after being adopted by Ms Dujardin.

'The foal was very, very thin,' she said. 'The vet discovered he had a severe lung infection and was riddled with worms. I don't think he would have survived the week if we hadn't got the veterinary care he needed.

'Luckily he pulled through and has gone from rags to riches as he's been adopted by Olympic gold medallist Charlotte Dujardin who has named him Santa.'

The other horse, called Frank, has since recovered and looking for a new home.

Fletcher, who was released on unconditional bail, will be sentenced at Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on June 9.
