As maces crash into shields and battle axes cut into armor, knights are left wounded and bloodied on the battlefield.

But while this scene appears reminiscent of a Medieval clash, these fights are happening in the U.S. with the launch of a new extreme sport in the form of a medieval fight club.

The Armored Combat League of America (ACL) sees knights from different states  face each other in battle, armed with maces and swords.

The Armored Combat League of America has launched its own Medieval fight club, where people dress as knights in full armor and equip themselves with maces and swords to do battle with rivals across the US

The knights are required to use 'real weapons, full force' as they face each other in battles across the US 

And they don't hold back from actual battle or injury. Founding member Jay Brooks said: 'It is as rough as human beings can be with one another without one of them dying.'

The ACL currently has around 100 people doing battle across America and was launched to give people enthusiastic about the medieval era the chance to relive it. 

Mr Brooks added: 'It just feels completely natural to us. This is what our ancestors did in the 14th and 15th centuries.

'It's a medieval fight club but we do want people to talk about it.

'I can't think of any other sport that is more intense. We are using real weapons, full force, full speed.

'I'm hitting a guy with a battleaxe in the back and other guys are getting hit in the head with a mace.'

Knights from rival factions based in different states meet each other in often fierce armed combat 

Those taking part are often left battered and bruised after facing each other, often with their wives looking on

Organisers said the club allows them to be as rough as possible for human beings without killing eachother

There are around 100 knights in America but the group hopes that will expand so more people can take part

Mr Brooks who is a full time knight and combat trainer said another reason for launching the club was the code of honor that fighters of the medieval era followed. 

He added: 'I try to live by the values of a knight. I try to adhere to the virtues of chivalry and justice and honour and truth.

'In this day and age a lot of people don't believe in an awful lot.

'The knights who lived in a very violent time had a code that they had to adhere to - if people held themselves to stronger codes today we'd all get along a lot better in this world.'

Battles are held with rival factions - with the New York Sentinels recently taking on the Boston Dark Knights.  

The club has brought a medieval fight club to New York, with knights taking the subway as they go to training

Despite the cost of armor and weapons for the battles, there are already more than 100 members of the club 

The Knights of New York decided to practice their battle skills in Time Square in preparation for combat 

In preparation for the tournament - two of the Knights of New York, Zorikh Lequidre, 47, and Sam Awry, 35, took to the streets to practice.

Mr Awry,a medieval history student, said: 'I don't think two medieval knights training for battle is the strangest thing people would see in public in New York City.'

Enthusiasm for the sport is growing in America - despite the high costs of taking part. 

A standard suit of armor can cost around $1,500 but top of the range protection can cost upwards of $15,400.

Organisers said people taking part are from a variety of different backgrounds, often looking for a chance to be a hero than some sort. 

And the sport also appears to take its toll on the wives of the knights, who are forced to watch their loved ones

Elizabeth Ross, 35, has watched her husband Brandon do battle as one of the Dark Knights of Boston.

'He is actually in retail but works for a company that sells building materials,' she said. 

'When he is out of his armour he's just like a normal, funny guy,

'In his armor he is pretty much fierce and beastly. It's quite amazing to behold and it is very sexy, very, very much so.'

However she does admit the weaponry causes some concerns.  

'The extremeness of the fighting is on my mind and I know that they are real weapons and that these guys are really into it,' she added.

The group currently has around 100 members but hopes to expand across the US.
