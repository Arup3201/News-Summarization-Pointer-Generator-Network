It’s a special occasion – but our birthdays are not always that happy.

The odds of dying on that day are higher than average, according to a study of millions of death records.

The excesses of partying plus accidents while travelling to celebrations are risk factors, warned researchers.

Suicides triggered by the ‘birthday blues’ may also be to blame, said academics at Chicago University.

Researcher Pablo Peña said the phenomenon could be due to people ‘deviating from their usual behaviour’ on their birthday.

Details of the demise of more than 25million people over 14 years were examined in the study. 

The data was recorded in the Death Master File, a list of all deaths in the US which is made public to prevent fraud.

Nearly 73,266 people died on their birthday, nearly 7 per cent more than would be expected, reported the journal Social Science & Medicine.
