Many pregnant women worry about sleepless nights and how they will juggle the demands of a newborn with daily life.

But for Karla Kirby, 38, her pregnancy is simply filled with gleeful anticipation of giving her new baby away.

For the chef, who lives in north Lincolnshire, is currently pregnant with her eleventh child, and as a surrogate mother, has already waved goodbye to ten biological children of her own.

In an interview with The Mirror, Karla said she decided to become a surrogate as she loved motherhood and was keen to help other people have a family of their own.

With two children of her own, and in her late teens, she overheard a conversation where people were discussing surrogacy and decided to contact the organisation Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy (COTS) to find out more.

After a counselling session to make sure she was ready, she opted to be a 'straight surrogate' using her own eggs and the intended father's sperm which she artificially inseminated herself. 

Karla chose to help a couple where the wife was infertile, and became pregnant after the eighth attempt, with her first surrogate child, Ethan, in 2001. 

She said seeing the emotion on the new parents' faces when she handed over the baby helped her realise she had made the right decision and 18 months later, became a surrogate again, going on to give birth to Nia in 2002 and Carey in 2003.

Her own two children, who were now aged six and seven, always knew the children she was carrying would not be part of their family and there was no stopping her.

'I had Macey in 2005, Maddie in 2007, Tyler in 2008, George in 2009, Hayden in 2011, Saskia in 2013 and Oliver in 2014 - the parents all name their own babies,' she told The Mirror.

Karla has bounced back quickly from each drug-free birth, although at 29 weeks pregnant, she is currently facing the prospect of delivering her 11th surrogate child via caesarian section due to a low lying placenta. 

Karla married her partner Taz last summer and praised her for her support during the last three pregnancies, although she said she was aware that her new wife would like her to retire from surrogacy.

She said it was strange to know there were ten children out there who shared her genes and she kept in touch with some of them including George and Macey who were flower girl and pageboy at her wedding.

However, she said while she was aware that each pregnancy brought with it additional health risks, she was not ready to give up.

'What I do helps to make people’s dreams come true - you just can’t put a price on that,' she added.
