Ann Mara, the matriarch of the NFL's New York Giants for the past 60 years, has died. She was 85.

Giants co-owner John Mara announced his mother's death on Super Bowl Sunday. 

Ann Mara slipped in front of her home in Rye, New York, during an ice storm two weeks ago and was hospitalized with a head injury the following day.

John Mara says that while there were initial hopes for recovery, complications developed and she died early Sunday.

Ann Mara and her children owned 50 percent of the Giants, one of the founding families of the league, since the death of her husband, Wellington, in 2005.

While she was not active in daily operations, her opinion was valued greatly.
