An elderly dementia patient in a nursing home was placed ‘in apprehension of offensive, physical harm’ by a stripper, a lawsuit has claimed.

The family of 85-year-old Bernice Youngblood decided to sue her Long Island care home after one of the sons found a picture in her belongings of her placing dollar bills in the underwear of a stripper, who was bent over her.

Several other residents at the East Neck Nursing Center in West Babylon were present in the room, with one appearing to be crying, according to the suit.

Risky business: The son of Bernice Youngblood (seen putting money in a stripper's underwear) was shocked when he arrived at her nursing home in Long Island to find this picture from a September 2012 strip show

Terrible and ashamed: Mrs. Youngblood (pictured) attended a dual press conference Tuesday in front of the facility and she said she felt 'terrible' and 'ashamed'

The family complained not only about the striptease show, but about the fact that Mrs Youngblood's money was supposed to be locked safely away.

They held a press conference outside the home Tuesday, which the woman's son Franklin Youngblood attended.

He said he immediately went to a nursing supervisor for an explanation after finding the photo. The lawsuit claims the nurse attempted to snatch the photo from him.

The suit said: ‘Plaintiff Bernice Youngblood was placed in apprehension of imminent, offensive, physical harm, as she was confused and bewildered as to why a muscular, almost nude man, was approaching her and placing his body and limbs, over [her] and directing [her] to place her hands about and upon his body, including his genital area, without [her] consent.'

It continued: ‘Hiring male strippers to perform for the defendant’s nursing-home patients was a serial occurrence.

‘Bernice Youngblood has lived 85 years as a traditional Baptist, hard-working, lady... And now she has been defiled.'

The
 show was put on 'all for the perverse pleasure and enjoyment of the 
Defendant’s staff', it added, and 'has breached its... duty of care by 
purchasing the services of male strippers and directing them to perform 
various sexually related acts upon the facility's patients knowing that 
its patients did not have the physical or mental capacity to consent to 
such vile acts or defend themselves against such vile acts'.

Outraged: The Youngblood family listen during the Tuesday press conference. Bernice's son Franklin Youngblood (center) says a nursing home employee tried snatching the photo when he first found it in January 2013

Howard
 Fensterman, an attorney representing the facility, said a 16-member 
resident committee had requested the September 2012 performance and the 
nursing home paid the $250 fee.

Fensterman
 said the facility's management reserves the right to reject a request 
by the residents' committee, particularly if the activity were deemed 
detrimental.

'But in this instance these are 
adults who wanted to have this activity, they requested it, they voted 
on it and the nursing home approved of it,' he said.

The
 claims and counter-claims came during a sequence of heated news 
conferences outside the facility in West Babylon. Reporters and 
cameramen jostled in a large scrum around Fensterman and Ray when they 
briefly became embroiled in an argument after Ray presented his 
counterpart with a copy of the lawsuit complaint.

Fensterman said the girlfriend of one of Youngblood's sons had taken her to the stripper show, and not nursing home employees.

Ray said Youngblood's son disputed 
that claim and, in any case, that does not mean Bernice Youngblood was 
not harmed by what she saw.

Fensterman
 also chided Ray for claiming that Bernice Youngblood was suffering from
 dementia, while at the same time noting the woman signed a power of 
attorney document claiming she was competent to sign it.

'Ms. Youngblood suffers from partial dementia,' Ray said. 'She has moments of partial lucidity.'

She
 attended the news conference in a wheelchair with some of her relatives
 at her side, mumbled in a barely audible voice that she felt "terrible"
 and "ashamed" about what happened, but had no specific recollection of 
the details of the incident.

The
 East Neck website says: ‘We will provide you or your loved one with an 
unsurpassed level of care that will nurture body, mind, and spirit.

'We honor the individuality, dignity, privacy, and safety of each individual with whom we have the pleasure of working.'

Counterpoint: Attorney Howard Fensterman, representing the East Neck Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, points to a newspaper article about the nursing home during a news conference. He says Youngblood was not escorted to the strip show by a staff member and questions the 85-year-old's mental unfitness
