Tens of thousands of desperate graduates queued for hours at a jobs fair in Chongqing, China, as they scrambled for just a few thousand new roles.

The fair was attended by around 150 companies who were looking to fill around 9,000 positions. Attending graduates had to queue for hours to speak for just a few minutes to potential employers.

The pictures were released amid growing uncertainty over the future of the jobs market in China. According to China's Education Ministry, 6.8 million students will graduate in 2012 from universities and colleges, but the economy has showed signs of slowing down.

Desperate: Graduates are crushed against the booth of a company offering employment. Getting simple unemployment figure for China is hard because of a vast pool of off-the-grid migrant workers

Sea of humanity: 6.8 million students will graduate in 2012 from universities and colleges, according to Chinese government figures.

This month Shanghai news website Eastday reported one in eleven college graduates have been jobless for a year, raising concerns among the public and prompting calls for the government to accelerate public spending to stimulate the economy.

In a blog, Xiong Bingqi, vice president of the 21st Century Education Research Center, quoted a '2012 Graduate Employment Report', which showed that 570,000 of 6.8 million college graduates in 2011 remained jobless one year after graduation.

Among them, more than 100,000 don't go to school, work or train in a new skill and rely on support from their parents.

Getting a simple overview of China’s 
labour market is complicated as the nation's official jobless figure 
does not count the 200 million migrant labourers who staff the country’s
factories and construction sites.

The
UK faces a similar post-higher education problem. Researchers from 
Warwick University found that graduates are also struggling to find jobs
that justify the debts they have built up in getting their degrees, 
with four in ten failing to get work that requires their qualifications,
while one in ten have spent at least six months on the dole.

Interviews: Most candidates had just minutes to impress potential employers

Prospects: 150 companies attended the Chongqing fair, offering a combined 9,000 jobs

Smiles: Three friends break away from the crowd, which numbered in the tens of thousands
