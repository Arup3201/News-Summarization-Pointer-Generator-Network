Captain Leslie Skinner, one of the first army chaplains to make it ashore on June 6, 1944, kept fascinating diaries, describing how he cared for his sick and wounded comrades

This is the face of the brave army chaplain who risked his life to care for his sick and wounded comrades as they fought their way out from the Normandy beachhead on D-day.

Captain Leslie Skinner, a Methodist minister, who served with the Sherwood Rangers Yeomnary, was one of the first chaplains to make it ashore on 6 June 1944.

Now his meticulously-kept diaries - which include an entry about the D-day landings - have been unveiled, as part of an exhibition to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the historic day.

The fascinating diary entries show how the army padre saw it as his duty to find the bodies of his fellow men, who were killed as the tanks of his regiment advanced.

He even refused to allow other tank crew members to help with the harrowing work, not wanting them to see how their comrades had died.

Captain Skinner - who travelled all over the front line talking and giving guidance to troops - also describes in the diaries how he helped medical staff care for the sick and wounded.

He talks of snipers with chest wounds, witnessing the deaths of his comrades and dodging rifle fires while digging graves, to ensure his fellow men were buried with dignity.

In the entry on 6 June 1944, Captain Skinner wrote: 'Up 0500 hours; cold, wet, sea rough. This is it. Running for beach by 0700.

'Under fire by 0710. Beached 0725. Man either side of me wounded. One lost leg. I was blown backwards onto Bren Carrier but OK.

'Made it to beach, though I had hell of pain in left side. Bed on ground about 0130. Dead beat. Fell asleep beside half-track.'

In another entry on 8 June 1944, Captain Skinner wrote about seeing a sniper suffering chest wounds.

He wrote: 'Late evening Lt Verner brought in, sniper wound to left chest – serious.

'Doctor dressed wound and I helped evacuate Verner to Advanced Dressing Station riding on rear door and bumper all way, holding bottle giving blood drip – nearly five miles of rough going.'

In an entry the following day, he writes about finding out that Captain Keith Douglas, who was known for his WWII war poetry, had been killed by enemy mortar fire while the regiment was advancing from Bayeux.

He said: 'Spent day touring all medical units back to beach area in search of regimental casualties. News of death of Captain Keith Douglas on Fwd slopes pt 102…Forward on foot and found bodies of Keith Douglas and Lt Pepler.

'Buried separately near to where each lay. Occasional rifle fire while digging graves.'

Nearly a 
year after Captain Skinner landed on the beach in Normandy, the 
war in Europe came to an end. In that time, the Sherwood Rangers 
Yeomanry lost 153 men, with six reported as missing.

But Captain Skinner's tireless work to locate the bodies of those that had been killed won him the 
praise and respect of the soldiers with whom he served.

It also meant the padre - who often wrote to the fallen soldiers' families after their deaths - had to deal first-hand with the stark realities of warfare.

On 25 June 1944, he wrote: 'In burst of machine gun fire I dived into slit trench on top of young soldier.

'It was his first show and he was all alone. I assured him that the machine gun fire was way up in the air…he picked up a ration box lid and held it above ground.

'Burst [of fire] cut it in two. It shook me. When firing stopped I moved out. He, poor devil, had to stay. About 11:30…Shrapnel got me acrossforehead and knocked me out. Lots of blood but soon conscious.'

In 4 August 1944, Captain Skinner wrote about the 'nasty business' he encountered while finding the bodies of dead soldiers.

He wrote: 'On foot located brewed up tanks. Only ash and burnt metal in Birkett’s tank. Searched ash and found remains pelvic bones. At other tanks three bodies still inside…Unable to remove bodies after long struggle – nasty business – sick.'

In the following diary extract from 17 August 1944, Captain Skinner explains why he would not allow tank crews to help him in his quest to recover bodies from inside the armoured vehicles.

He wrote: 'Place absolute shambles. Infantry dead and some Germans lying around. Horrible mess.

'Fearful job picking up bits and pieces and re-assembling for identification and putting in blankets for burial. No infantry to help.

'Squadron Leader offered to lend me some men to help. Refused. Less men who live and fight in tanks have to do with this side of things the better. My job. This was more than normally sick making. Really ill – vomiting.'

As well as picking up the bodies, Padre Skinner made it his mission to methodically record the location and personal details of Sherwood Rangers men killed in action.

He located all but six of the fallen men and only missed out on recording the details of these men as he was away from the regiment at the time, recovering from wounds he had suffered himself.

His commanding officer had to stop him from venturing onto the battlefield in search of one of the missing men.

In his diaries, Captain Skinner also describes how the German forces were respectful of the burials of Allied servicemen.

On 2 September 1944 he wrote: 'Left driver and truck, entered village via ditch…Made way to village parsonage.

'Bodies of Sgt Cribben and Trooper Sharp beautifully laid out in white shrouds having been washed. I stitched the bodies up.

'Cure [priest] in robes led funeral cortege down street. The Germans had watched the funeral procession and seen the service from their tank without interference.'

Captain Skinner also spent a lot of his time writing heartfelt letters to the relatives of the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry men who had been killed.

Sometimes, it started a chain of correspondence which continued for many years after the war.

The padre was also comforted by regular letters and parcels from his wife Etta, as his diary entry from 11 October 1944 shows.

He wrote: 'Wrote Etta. During morning parcel [arrived] from Etta with coffee. Rain stopped and sun shining.

'All afternoon doing follow-up Casualty Letters. Feeling tired after sad job. Another letter came late from Etta. Wrote replies and thanks for parcel.'

After the war,  Captain Skinner served as a parish priest and remained in the Territorial Army (TA).

He ended his career as Deputy Assistant Chaplain General TA for the London district, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, the highest rank a TA chaplain could hold in peacetime.

The Padre’s Trail is on display at the Normandy
 Experience in the Land Warfare exhibition at IWM Duxford, Cambridge, from Friday 16 May 2014.
