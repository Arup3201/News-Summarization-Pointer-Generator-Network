The winner of this year's 'Mrs Australia' could be about to be dethroned, forced to step down from the prestigious title and give up her shiny crown after announcing she has split from her husband.

Kate Johnson, born in Manly, Sydney, was the winner of the 2014 title, which showcases the talents and beauty of married women only.

The 30 year old stunner told the Daily Telegraph she had separated from her husband of five years, Jason and is now living as a single woman.

'It was an amicable split,' she said, 'I think about 70 per cent of military relationships end up in divorce and unfortunately we are going to be one of them.'

The pair, who met working as youth instructors with the Australian air force cadets in Darwin in 2007 and got married a year later, have been living in Sydney for the last four years.

While the split is believed to be amicable a friend told the Daily Telegraph Ms Johnson felt under appreciated.

Johnson who lists her profession on her Facebook page as model and businesswoman, is also an ambassador for Ovarian Cancer Australia and recently represented Australia at the Mrs International competition in the US in July in which she placed fifth.

On it's website the event is described as part of the International Pageant system, developed to promote today's married women, their accomplishments, and commitment to family and marriage.

It also says, 'around the world women are finding this system to be the opportunity to work with their husband and family to become positive role models.'

The contest based purely on charity work, is only for married women, with another category catering for unmarried women.

And while the split has already been a couple of months, Ms Johnson has no plans anytime soon to change her newly single status.

'In my line of work it is incredibly hard to meet someone anyway. I'm just focusing on my work, my charity and I'm looking forward to what the future holds,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

Ms Johnson is also an ambassador for the touch of goodness foundation which helps to raise awareness about different programs in Australia and abroad.
