David Cameron has taken credit for the European Commission's acknowledgement that controls may be needed over the free movement of workers

David Cameron last night claimed victory after Brussels agreed that restrictions on the free movement of workers may be needed when new countries join the EU.

Countries such as Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, Macedonia, Bosnia and Turkey have all applied to join the union and have started negotiations.

The Prime Minister has long argued that transitional controls must be imposed if these countries are granted accession, to ensure that poor workers do not flood Western Europe looking for work.

He has promised renegotiation with the EU to get powers back to Westminster, including powers to enable us to crack down on free movement, with an in/out referendum to be held by the end of 2017.

Brussels has so far always argued against such moves, saying the free movement of workers was an unshakable tenet of the European project.

But yesterday the European Commission gave Mr Cameron some hope.

It published its updated ‘enlargement strategy’ for 2014/15, containing project reports for each applicant country.

This report comes out every year but, for the first time, it makes clear that negotiations on future countries joining will need to address the nature of transitional controls and the possible need for a safeguard mechanism on the free movement of workers.

The report said: ‘The possible need for and nature of transitional measures and/or a safeguard mechanism on the free movement of workers will be addressed in the course of accession negotiations on future enlargement, taking into account a future impact assessment.’

Mr Cameron said: ‘People across Europe are increasingly worried about the impact of immigration on their local community and this is an issue we need to address.

‘Less than a year ago, I kicked off a debate about how we prevent vast population movements across our continent when new countries join and I’m pleased that the Commission have acknowledged we need to look at this issue before more countries join.

‘This shows how when we lead the debate in Europe, we can shape it and make sure that the EU starts dealing with people’s concerns.’

A Number 10 source accepted that there is still much to be debated and agreed, but said it was ‘welcome’ to see the European Commission raising the issue. 

Meanwhile, last night a committee of MEPs finally approved Lord Hill as European commissioner for financial services – 45 in favour and 13 against.

Lord Hill has been approved as European commissioner for financial services with a 45 to 13 vote

They had called back the Tory peer, a close ally of Mr Cameron, for further questioning after expressing concerns he would put the interests of the City above the EU.

On Tuesday he caused embarrassment for the Prime Minister during the hearing by saying the UK would definitely be in the Union beyond the 2017 referendum.
