'A Marcel Proust for our time': French writer Patrick Modiano was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature today for work focusing on Nazi occupation of France

French writer Patrick Modiano was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature today for his work focusing on the Nazi occupation and its effect on his country.

The Swedish Academy gave the 8 million kronor ($1.1 million) prize to Modiano 'for the art of memory with which he has evoked the most ungraspable human destinies and uncovered the life-world of the occupation.'

Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said of Modiano: 'You could say he's a Marcel Proust of our time.'

'He has written some 30 different books,' Mr Englund said. 'Many novels but also a number of children's books, movie scripts, and so on. But he's mainly knwon for his novels which are very specific.

'They are small books - 130 to 150 pages - which use variations of the same theme about memory, about loss, about identity, about seeking.'

Mr Englund added: 'His best known work is called Missing Person. It’s the story about a detective who has lost his memory and his final case is finding out who he really is; he is tracing his own steps through history to find out who he is.'

The 69-year-old - whose novel Missing Person won the prestigious Prix Goncourt in 1978 - was born in a west Paris suburb in July 1945, two months after the Second World War ended in Europe.

His father was of Jewish Italian origins and met his Belgian actress mother during the occupation of Paris, and his beginnings have strongly influenced his writing.

Jewishness, the Nazi occupation and loss of identity are recurrent themes in his novels, which include 1968's La Place De L'Etoile, which was later hailed in Germany as a key Post-Holocaust work.

Modiano owes his first big break to a friend of his mother's, French writer Raymond Queneau, who first introduced him to the Gallimard publishing house when he was in his early twenties.

Modiano, who lives in Paris, rarely accords interviews. He has published more than 40 works in French, some of which have been translated into English, including 'Ring of Roads: A Novel,' 'Villa Triste,' 'A Trace of Malice,' and 'Honeymoon.'

He has also written children's books and film scripts, including co-writing the 1974 movie 'Lacombe, Lucien' with director Louis Malle and the 2003 movie 'Bon Voyage' with director Jean-Paul Rappeneau.

He was a member of the jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 2000 and in 2012 won the Austrian State Prize for European Literature.

Dervila Cooke of Dublin City University, author of a book on Modiano, said his works dealt with the traumas of France's past but have a 'darkly humorous touch.'

'His prose is crystal clear and resonant,' she said. 'A common description of his work is of its petite musique — it's haunting little music.'

Mr Englund said Modiano's works often explore the themes of time, memory and identity.

'He is returning to the same topics again and again simply because these topics, you can't exhaust them,' Mr Englund told journalists in Stockholm.

'You can't give a definite answer to: Why did I turn into the person I am today? What happened to me? How will I break out of the weight of time? How can I reach back into past times?'

Betting on Modiano to win the Nobel Prize surged in the week before the announcement, raising questions about a possible leak.

David Williams of bookmaker Ladbrokes said Modiano's odds had shortened from 100-1 a few months ago to 10-1 before the announcement.

Something similar occurred the last time there was a French winner, when Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clezio won the Nobel literature prize in 2008. The academy at the time suspected a leak.

But Mr Williams said the betting pattern on Modiano was not suspicious.

'We are experts in analyzing betting patterns and we kind of know what a leak looks like. This doesn't look like a leak. It just looks like his fans got behind him and gave him a bit of momentum,' he told The Associated Press.

Literature was the fourth of this year's Nobel prizes.

Two Japanese researchers and a Japanese-born American won the physics prize for the invention of blue light-emitting diodes, a breakthrough that spurred the development of LED as a new light source.

The chemistry prize on Wednesday went to two Americans and a German researcher who found new ways to give microscopes sharper vision, letting scientists peer into living cells with unprecedented detail.

The announcements continue tomorrow with the Nobel Peace Prize and the economics award on Monday.

The prize is named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, and has been awarded since 1901 for achievements in science, literature and peace in accordance with his will.

As always, the awards will be presented on December 10, the anniversary Nobel's death in 1896.
