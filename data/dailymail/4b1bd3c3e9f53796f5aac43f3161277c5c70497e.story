When Gordon Hailwood saw the first flickering video images of a wall of oozing, stinking grease, he knew that his day had taken a turn for the worse.

This wasn’t just a normal sewer blockage. This was the mother of all blockages — a putrid, steaming mountain of congealed lard and worse, the size of a double-decker bus and weighing a staggering 15 tons. Disgusting isn’t the word.

Dante claimed Hell had nine circles, while Jean-Paul Sartre insisted that Hell was other people. But clearly neither had ever been in close proximity to a ‘fatberg’.

They look revolting, they smell 
revolting, they harbour disease and they are almost impossible to shift.
 And if one forms in the sewer near your home, then heaven help you. 
Unless it is quickly removed, your drains and lavatories will soon be 
overflowing with filth.

What’s most shocking is that the 
number of fatbergs is on the rise, and our careless attitude to what we 
flush down the drains and sewers — and our love affairs with fattening 
takeaway food and cooking oil — are responsible.

‘We get immune to most things, but 
when you come across a lump of decomposing fat, the smell is horrid,’ 
says Gordon, who has cleared sewers for Thames Water for 18 years.

‘The fatbergs are usually lard-coloured, with flecks of brown and black, depending on what is in them.

‘If you touch it, or if it gets on 
your skin, then the smell stays with you for five to seven days, no 
matter how many times you wash or shower.

‘It’s like old rotten compost, or musty dog combined with the smell of sewers.’

Among the biggest problems are 
wet-wipes and other products that are flushed away but don’t break down 
in the sewer, says Gordon. If they snag, then the fat starts to congeal 
on them and it builds up.

‘People flush fat down the sink and 
think that because they pour a kettle of hot water after it that it’s 
gone,’ he says. ‘But of course they just move the problem on. No amount 
of detergent stops it congealing in the sewer.’

The accumulation of fat in our 
crumbling, Victorian sewers is nothing new — although the amount of oil
 we are consuming in our diets is.

Sixteen years ago I wrote for the 
Daily Mail about the sludge choking up the drains and sewers of Central 
London — mostly from restaurants and takeaways that failed to fit  
fat-traps to siphon off the waste.

Back in 1997, Thames Water reckoned it
 had to scrape away 37 cubic feet of congealed fat from sewers in the 
heart of the capital, using hand-picks and pressure hoses. But that was 
from a two-mile area.

What is astonishing about this latest
 fatberg is the sheer volume in one giant lump under a single street in 
an outer London suburb.

To put it into perspective, in the 
late Nineties, Thames Water spent £2 million scraping fat from its  
network. Last year it spent £12 million. Such costs are inevitably 
passed on to customers via their bills.

But nothing has ever rivalled the record-breaking fatberg discovered by Gordon’s team in Kingston  upon Thames.

That plug of grease was so big it 
nearly blocked the 2.4m-wide brick sewer and caused toilets to stop 
flushing in a nearby block of flats.

Left for a few days longer, the  sewer
 would have clogged up completely, forcing raw sewage out of manholes 
and up through toilets into bathrooms — spreading the kind of filth and 
disease normally associated with the poorest shanty towns in the world.

‘I’ve never seen anything like it,’ 
says Gordon, whose team worked every night for three weeks to  clear it,
 using shovels and a high-pressure hose.

‘We know exactly how much it weighed 
because we scraped out the fat and took it away to be measured. Normally
 you would pull out one or two tons. But this weighed 15 tons.’

Rivers of filth: If workers hadn't cleared the mass, raw sewage could have spurted out of manholes across the whole of Kingston

In suburban areas, households are as 
much to blame as restaurants and takeaway outlets for pouring cooking 
oil down sinks. When the oil hits the cold water in sewers, it 
congeals. Fat and oil should be bottled and disposed of in bins, water 
companies say.

Yet Londoners alone pour away around 33-44 million litres of cooking oil each year.

The careless disposal of fat is only 
part of the story of how a fatberg forms. We are also becoming more 
fastidious about our bodies — using wet-wipes as never before.

Once they were used only on babies — 
now they can be found in bathrooms nationwide. As with many things, 
celebrities have helped fuel the trend.

Sales of wet-wipes are rising by 
around 15 per cent a year, with many sold on the promise they are 
‘flush-able’. That’s a word the water companies dispute. Those 
‘flushable wipes’ cause 75 per cent of all sewer blockages, according to
 Thames Water.

The company says it clears nearly 
40,000 blockages every year in its 59,000 miles of sewers and pipes. It 
is a similar story for water firms in other parts of the UK.

Simon Evans, a Thames Water spokesman,
 says: ‘We are seeing an increasing trend across Britain of people using
 wet-wipes instead of loo roll. Goodness knows why.

‘Our sewers are designed to take human
 waste and loo roll, and nothing else. When a wipe goes down, it doesn’t
 break down. Manufacturers say they do eventually, but that’s in a 
landfill site. In contrast, loo roll breaks down in seconds.

‘No moistened wipe has yet to come on the market that is acceptable to sewers.’

When wipes are flushed away, they 
catch on joints or corners of sewers, particularly in older Victorian 
tunnels that run under our major towns and cities.

Fat congeals on the wipes, which 
attracts more wipes — and more fat. The bergs build up like foul 
stalactites from the roofs of sewers.

About the latest fatberg, Mr Evans 
says: ‘We’ve removed greater volumes of fat from under the sewers in 
Central London but we’ve never come across a congealed single lump of 
lard of this size.

‘It was clinging to the roof and the floor, and was the whole breadth of the sewer.’

The solution, according to water 
companies, is for people to look to the continent. If they want to use 
wipes, they should do what the Greeks do.

Much of the plumbing in Greece is 
unable to cope with toilet paper, so visitors to the loo must place 
paper in a bin. What works for toilet paper, works for wipes.

The longer-term solution, though, is 
surely to start investing in bidets. What could be cleaner, cheaper and 
less harmful to the environment than a dose of old-fashioned water and 
soap?

Wipes, meanwhile, are best left for 
changing nappies. Otherwise, Gordon Hailwood and his colleagues at water
 companies across the country will ultimately find themselves facing 
fatbergs the size of mountains.
