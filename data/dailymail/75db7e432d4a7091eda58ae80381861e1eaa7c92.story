When Eoin Morgan spoke at the end of Sunday’s thumping defeat he seemed to be suggesting that it would still all somehow be ‘alright on the night’ for England at this World Cup.

Well, I’m afraid it won’t be unless everyone involved, both players and management, have a good hard look at themselves.

There needs to be a lot of hard, honest talking in that England camp over the next few days and a re-evaluation of how they are doing things because if they carry on like this they will not be involved in the World Cup for much longer.

'Even when England put what looks like a challenging score on the board they are still brushed aside with contemptuous ease. Not for the first time in this World Cup they seemed like boys in the men’s world of modern one-day cricket.'

England now need to win their next five games if they are going to lift their first World Cup. When did they last win five one-day internationals on the trot? It is going to be hard enough to win two in a row, let alone the next five.

The whole tone was set with the sight of Gary Ballance walking out at three after England had got off to a really good start. Now, it’s not Ballance’s fault. He did not ask to be picked out of position and out of nick.

But it just sent a message to England’s players that they were going to prod their way through the middle overs and then have a go in the last 15. And it was a policy that brought England 309 that in the old days would probably be enough. Now it is nowhere near. It is plain ridiculous.

Contrast that with Sri Lanka. They get off to a good start, lose a wicket like England, but then in walks a world class No 3 in Kumar Sangakkara who knew exactly how to pace the innings and ensure Sri Lanka won with ease.

And how come Jos Buttler was left with just 19 deliveries at the end of the innings? He made one of the best one-day hundreds I have seen from an England player last summer — and it was against Sri Lanka at Lord’s. Now he is not being allowed nearly enough time to put England out of sight.

Then, sitting on the bench, we have Alex Hales, who hit one of the best Twenty20 hundreds you will see by an England player. And that happened to come against Sri Lanka too, in last year’s World Twenty20 in Bangladesh.

Sri Lanka must have looked at England and laughed to see two such key players being under-used and, worse, not being used at all.

Then we have bowling that was just too one-dimensional to make any sort of impact on Sri Lanka. It was all right-arm, all one-paced and most of it too short. We cannot just bang the ball in halfway down and expect to bully sub-continental players any more. It just ain’t going to happen these days.

Moeen Ali has been England’s most economical bowler at this World Cup. So why not play a second spinner in James Tredwell? Or why not try Ravi Bopara’s cutters with the keeper standing up?

Anything to get a bit more variety into the attack because the bowlers offered Eoin Morgan nothing in Wellington. They just never looked like getting people out, even if a couple of chances did go down.

In the first over of the batting power-play, with fine leg up, Stuart Broad banged one in short and was hit for four by Kumar Sangakkara. Then from the first ball of the second over Steven Finn did the same the same thing and was hit for six. It just isn’t working and England need a rethink.

There is no magic fix. There aren’t lots of brilliant players waiting to come in to this one-day side. Those who are on the outside are there for a reason and have, in most cases, fallen short to a larger or smaller degree. That’s why I keep on saying the culture has to change as much as the personnel.

Australia coach Darren Lehmann has shown that a change in coach can change a culture too

From what I’ve heard over the last year or two that culture has been driven by pre-meditated plans and statistics when it should be gut feeling and instinct

The next week needs to be spent thinking how England can start playing a different brand of one-day cricket. The captain, who used to play with that gut feeling and instinct, needs to take the lead but Darren Lehmann has shown that the coach can change a culture too.

England cannot go into their remaining matches at this World Cup with their fingers crossed. Boy, do they need to start plotting a new way forward.

The bowling was one-dimensional and there were players out of position

Jos Buttler got just 19 deliveries, despite impressing last summer against Sri Lanka at Lord's - why not give him more of a chance?
