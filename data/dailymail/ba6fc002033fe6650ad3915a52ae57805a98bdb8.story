Stoke City are set to finally sign Monaco winger Emmanuel Riviere in an £8million deal this summer.

The 24-year-old was due to sign for the Potters in January but a knee injury to Radamel Falcao scuppered the deal.

However, the former France Under-21 
international enjoyed a fruitful term as he notched 10 goals in 30 
appearances Ligue 1 for Monaco, which helped them finish second.

Riviere had been a target for West Bromwich Albion but they were beaten by their midland neighbours to the attacker.

 Hughes will view the capture of the former France Under-21 
international as something of a fillip as he can operate as a striker.

The signing of Riviere will bolster Hughes' attacking options as the Potters look to consolidate and improve on their ninth place Premier League finish this season.
