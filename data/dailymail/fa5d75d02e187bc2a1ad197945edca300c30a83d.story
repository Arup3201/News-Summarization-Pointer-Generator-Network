The United States government has denied Edward Snowden's claims that he was an undercover spy and had worked for both the CIA and NSA.

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has spoken out in the wake of Snowden's first televised interview that aired on NBC Wednesday night.

When asked if Snowden's claim was true, Ms Rice bluntly said: 'No'.

'Edward Snowden was a contractor working for the NSA and other elements of the intelligence community,' she said to CNN's Wolf Blitzer after being prompted with another question.

His side: Edward Snowden told NBC's Brian Williams that he previously worked as an undercover operative for the CIA and the NSA, but the government has since denied those claims

'Obviously he’s accused of sharing and disclosing, illegally, some of the most sensitive information of the United States government, allegedly, and our strong view is that rather than give television interviews, he ought to come home and have his day in court where he will be treated with all of the protections and fairness that our judicial system allows.'

Speaking out: Susan Rice told CNN that Snowden never served in such capacities and he should come back to America to be brought to court

Her comments come after Brian William's full interview with Snowden aired, wherein he claimed to have had experience working as a government-backed undercover agent in addition to working later as an analyst and contractor for the NSA.

'I was trained as a spy in terms of the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover, overseas, pretending to work in a job that I'm not, and even being assigned a name that was not mine,' he said to NBC.

'Now the government might deny these things, they might frame it in certain ways and say "Oh, well he's a low-level analyst" but what they're trying to do is they're trying to use one position that I've had in a career here or there to distract from the totality of my experience, which is that I've worked for the Central Intelligence Agency- undercover, overseas. I've worked for the National Security Agency- undercover, overseas- and I've worked at the Department of Defense as a lecturer at the joint-training  academy where I developed sources and methods for keeping our people and information secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments across the world.'

He went on to claim that before he turned over the documents to journalist Glenn Greenwald, he started to go through official channels to report his apparent concern over the NSA's surveillance programs.

More evidence: Snowden said that he sent emails to his higher ups at the NSA before leaking, expressing his concerns, but the government took the unprecedented step on Thursday of releasing one email that went against his comments

In response, the government used their new Intelligence Community Tumblr to released one email that they had on file from Snowden.

The email is dated April 8, 2013, and seems to be an inquiry about the definition of the scope of executive orders as dictated in part of his training.

'NSA has now explained that they have found one email inquiry by Edward Snowden to the Office of General Counsel asking for an explanation of some material that was in a training course he had just completed,' the IC On The Record Tumblr caption notes.

'The e-mail did not raise allegations or concerns about wrongdoing or abuse, but posed a legal question that the Office of General Counsel addressed.'

Edward Snowden's email, dated Friday, April 5, 2013

Hello, I have a question regarding the mandatory USSID 18 training. The training states the following: ----(U) The Hierarchy of Governing Authorities and Documents is displayed from the highest authority to the lowest authority as follows:U.S. ConstitutionFederal Statutes/Presidential Executive Orders (EO)Department of Defense (DoD) and Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) RegulationsNSA/CSS Directives and Policies      USSIDs      SID Management Directives and Policies      Office Policies----I'm not entirely certain, but this does not seem correct, as it seems to imply Executive Orders have the same precedence as law. My understanding is that EOs may be superceded by federal statute, but EOs may not override statute. Am I incorrect in this? Between EOs and laws, which have precedence?Similarly, between DOD and ODNI regulations, which has greater precedence? Could you please clarify?Thank you very much, Ed

Official response, sender's name redacted, sent on Monday April 8, 2013Hello Ed,Executive Orders (E.O.s) have the "force and effect of law." That said, you are correct that E.O.s cannot override a statute.In general, DOD and ODNI regulations are afforded similar precedence though subject matter or date could result in one having precedence over another. Please give me a call if you would like to discuss further. Regards, [name redacted]Office of General Counsel

Full exchange: This email chain was released by a government-run blog on Thursday afternoon in an effort to discredit Snowden's claims that he sent emails showing he was concerned about NSA policies

@highlight

Snowden claimed that he worked for the CIA, NSA and Department of Defense at different points in his career

@highlight

National Security Adviser Susan Rice has shot down that theory and said that he never worked as a spy for any branch of the government

@highlight

In his first televised interview, he told how he tried going through official channels by emailing his boss about concerns before leaking

@highlight

Government released one email he sent asking a question about legal precedence- with no sense of concern
