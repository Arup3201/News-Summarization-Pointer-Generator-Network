A 20-year-old Boston University sophomore and a self-described 'cellist-nerd' brought the Miss Universe crown back to the U.S. for the first time in more than a decade when she won the televised contest on Wednesday.

Olivia Culpo beat 88 other beauty queens to take the title from Leila Lopes of Angola during the two-hour competition at the Planet Hollywood casino on the Las Vegas Strip.

In a refreshing change, the Miss Universe title, which makes Olivia unequivocally one of the world's most beautiful women, appears to have been bestowed on a girl with a healthy streak of normality.

Following the win, her brother told CBS that
she was 'really chubby and sort of weird when she was younger' while 
her father said Olivia was the 'nerdiest' of his five children.

Family pictures show Olivia goofing around with friends as she gets pushed along in a shopping cart and playing with her siblings Peter, Gus, Sophia and Aurora. 

Indeed, her family appears to be taken back by her decision to enter the world of pageants, something they knew nothing about. 

Olivia won Miss Rhode Island last year while wearing a $20 rental dress. She then became the first Miss USA winner from Rhode Island when she took the national crown in Las Vegas in June.

She grew up in Cranston as the middle child of five with two professional musicians for parents, Susan and Peter Culpo.

She
graduated from St Mary Academy Bay View in 2010 and is a member of the 
National Honor Society. Her love of Italian led her to spend two 
summers studying in Milan. 

The 20-year-old has played the cello alongside world-renowned classical musician Yo-Yo Ma and performed at Carnegie Hall.

An American had not won the right to be called Miss Universe since Brook Lee won the title in 1997.

Culpo wore a tight navy blue mini-dress with a sequined bodice as she walked on stage for the competition's opening number.

Later in the night, she strutted in a purple and blue bikini, and donned a wintery red velvet gown with a plunging neckline. Culpo's coronation ends a long losing spell for the U.S. in the competition co-owned by Donald Trump and NBC.

Culpo was good enough during preliminary competitions to be chosen as one of 16 semifinalists who moved on to compete in the pageant's finale.

Her bid lasted through swimsuit, evening wear, and interview competitions that saw cuts after each round. She
won over the judges, even after tripping slightly during the evening 
gown competition. Telecasters pointed it out but also noted her poised 
recovery.

She told the Today show on Thursday that with the heels and gown she was wearing it was inevitable she tripped and was lucky not to 'fall flat on her face'.

She also said that in her new role as Miss Universe, she would be using her ability to travel internationally to raise awareness of HIV/Aids.

Hosts with the most: Andy Cohen and Giuliana Rancic co-hosted the event, but who can forget the larger-than-life personality who owns the competition - Donald Trump

Minutes before Miss Culpo was crowned on Wednesday night, she was asked whether she had she had ever done something she regretted.

'I'd like to start off by saying that every experience no matter what it is, good or bad, you'll learn from it.

'That's just life,' she said. 'But something I've done I've regretted is probably picking on my siblings growing up, because you appreciate them so much more as you grow older.'

Miss Philippines, Janine Tugonon, came in second, while Miss Venezuela, Irene Sofia Esser Quintero, placed third.

All the contestants spent the past two weeks in Sin City, where they posed in hardhats at a hotel groundbreaking, took a painting lesson, and played pranks on hotel guests by hiding in their rooms.

On her Miss Universe page, she said she hopes to pursue a career in film or television, and cites Audrey Hepburn as a role model because of her 'generosity, intelligence and grace'.

With Culpo's promotion, Miss Maryland Nana Meriwether becomes the new Miss USA.

The Miss Universe pageant was back in Las Vegas this year after being held in Sao Paulo in 2011. It aired live on NBC and was streamed to more than 100 countries.

Organizers had considered holding the 61st annual Miss Universe in the popular Dominican Republic tourist city of Punta Cana, but Miss Universe Organization President Paula Shugart said that country's financial crisis proved to be too much of an obstacle.

The panel of ten judges included singer Cee Lo Green, Iron Chef star Masaharu Morimoto and Pablo Sandoval of the San Francisco Giants.

Asked on the red carpet whether he found playing in the World Series or judging the beauty pageant to be more difficult, Sandoval said both were hard.

Sharply dressed women and men, including a large contingent from South America, held banners and cheered on their favorite contestants.

The pageant started as a local revue in Long Beach, California, organized by Catalina Swimwear.

It is not affiliated with the Miss America pageant and unlike that contest, does not include a talent section.

Contestants in the pageant cannot have been married or have children. They must be younger than 27 and older than 18 by February 1 of the competition year.

As Miss Universe, Culpo will receive an undisclosed salary, a wardrobe fit for a queen, a limitless supply of beauty products, and a luxury apartment in New York City.
