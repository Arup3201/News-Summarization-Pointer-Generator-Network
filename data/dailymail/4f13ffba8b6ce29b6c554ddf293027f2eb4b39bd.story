A former Playboy Playmate has admitted to helping her Canadian boyfriend after he illegally entered the United States in northern New York last summer.

Colleen Shannon pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday to a felony charge and faces a sentence ranging from no jail time to 10 months.

Federal agents say the 35-year-old Los Angeles resident and her paramour, Robert Skojo, were arrested after he illegally crossed the border and rendezvoused with her in Fort Covington. Officials say Skojo has a criminal record in Canada.

The statuesque blonde was the centerfold for Playboy's 50th anniversary edition in 2004. Shannon currently works as a disc jockey and calls herself the world's sexiest DJ. She declined to comment after her guilty plea.

For her court appearance Tuesday, Shannon picked a conservative ensemble consisting of a white blouse paired with a black jacket, matching tight pants and spiky leather boots. The demure getup was accessorized with two large Louis Vuitton bags slung over the ex-playmate’s shoulders.  

Shannon's boyfriend told authorities he knew his criminal record would bar his U.S. entry. He's jailed and faces deportation.

If the 35-year-old woman gets credit for accepting responsibility for her role in the case, Shannon will face anywhere between no jail time and six months behind bars.

Without the credit, she would face a sentence between four and 10 months when she learns her fate October 22, the Post-Standard of Syracuse reported.

Shannon and Skojo were arrested in August 2012 in Fort Covington, New York, after federal agents said he entered the U.S. illegally by boat through the Akwesasne Mohawk Indian Reservation, which straddles the border.

Skojo was convicted in Canada in 1990 of 'procuring sexual services' and 'living on the avails of prostitution,' the Post-Standard of Syracuse quotes court papers as saying. He was also convicted of drug charges in 1996 and 1999.

Shannon's attorney, John Conrad, said that Skojo's drug convictions got him barred from legally immigrating to the U.S. According to the lawyer, his client was not aware of her boyfriend's prostitution charges.

Skojo had applied for a waiver that would have made him eligible to enter the country, and he and Shannnon assumed that it would eventually be granted, according to Conrad. 

Skojo was sentenced in November to six months in jail for entering the U.S. illegally and he now faces deportation.

Skojo began dating Shannon in 2011 after she DJ'd a party he hosted, according to the Post-Standard.

The 2004 playmate, who now works as a disc jockey, was taken into custody after being charged with violating a federal statute prohibiting 'bringing in and harboring aliens'.

U.S. Border Patrol agents stopped Shannon on August 15 at the Massena point of entry, where she'd driven alone in Skojo's 2005 Bentley, court documents said. The two planned to live together in Los Angeles.

The newspaper reported that Shannon 
declared that she had $9,800 in cash with her, which she said was from 
her job as a DJ, but she couldn't prove Skojo had given permission to 
drive his car.

Shannon told the agents she was an actress and that she was driving to New York City to meet her agent.

Border Patrol let her go, then notified agents with Homeland Security Investigations.

Agents watched her drive to a hotel in Fort Covington hotel and Skojo met her there that night, the papers said.

The couple were arrested the next morning.

Shannon had previously claimed she shouldn't be charged with alien smuggling because she didn't drive Skojo across the border.

'Instead, according to Shannon, she was simply picking up her boyfriend,' the prosecutor's court papers said.

The former playmate faces 10 years in prison if convicted.

In her 2004 Playboy profile, Shannon, who is from Alaska, said she was turned-on by 'positivity and supportiveness' while turn-offs included negativity and being a bad kisser. 

She said: 'Everyone is put here to do something. Your subconscious tells you the things that you love to do, but a lot of people put those things aside.

'I think if you stick to things you love, nine times out of ten, circumstances are going to go your way and you will live a happy life.'
