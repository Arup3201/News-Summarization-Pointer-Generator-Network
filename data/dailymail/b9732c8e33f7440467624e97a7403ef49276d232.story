Struggle: It is the first time since 2006 that prices have decreased year-on-year (file photo)

Family food bills fell last month for the first time in eight years, figures revealed yesterday.

The Office for National Statistics said grocery prices were 0.6 per cent lower in May than they were 12 months before, as inflation fell to its lowest level in nearly five years.

The first annual drop in food bills since March 2006 shows that the supermarket price wars are starting to cut costs at the checkout.

Analysts said the figures will ease the pressure on the Bank of England to push up interest rates.

The ONS said the Consumer Price Index measure of inflation dropped sharply, with prices of all consumer goods rising by just 1.5 per cent in the 12 months to May. This is the lowest inflation level since October 2009 – well below the Government’s target of 2 per cent.

The Prime Minister said the drop in inflation, down from 1.8 per cent in April, means ‘more stability and financial security for everyone’.Falling food costs were driven by a variety of product categories, particularly bread, cereals, meat, vegetables and soft drinks, said the ONS.

Tesco, Morrisons and the Co-op have slashed prices in a bid to lure back shoppers who have switched to cheaper discount stores.

Morrisons has vowed to cut £1billion from the prices of more than 1,200 items over the next three years. But the ONS figures also showed that the squeeze on families remains acute, after six years of below-inflation pay rises.

The ONS said falling food prices were 
being driven by ‘a variety of product categories’, particularly bread, 
cereals, meat, vegetables and soft drinks.

The average worker currently receives an annual pay rise of 0.7 per cent, less than half the current level of CPI inflation. While food prices fell last month, they have risen by more than 70 per cent over the past eight years, nearly four times faster than salaries have increased.

Figures show food and soft drinks prices rose by 71 per cent between April 2006 and April this year. By comparison, salaries, including bonuses, rose by just 18 per cent over the same period.

Debt charity StepChange estimates that around seven million people are so vulnerable that a 25 per cent fall in income would see them exhaust their savings in a week.

Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘It continues to look likely that CPI inflation will ease further, perhaps to as low as 1 per cent by the end of the year.

‘Against this low inflation backdrop, we believe the Bank of England is likely to tread cautiously and raise interest rates only very gradually over the coming years.’

The Bank of England has kept the base rate frozen at 0.5 per cent since March 2009 but the governor, Mark Carney, said the first increase for seven years might come sooner than expected.

The increases will be ‘gradual and limited’, he said in a bid to stop families from panicking about a rapid rise in rates.
