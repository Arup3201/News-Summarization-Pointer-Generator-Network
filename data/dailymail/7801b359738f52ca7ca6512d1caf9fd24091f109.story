Still smiling: Matthew Hawksley returns to the spot where he broke his neck jumping into the sea

Meet Matthew Hawksley – the man with nine lives.

In a tale of survival that would make the most death-defying cat jealous, the 25-year-old has come through a catalogue of life-threatening dramas.

In all, he has cheated death eight times – surviving a broken neck, heart attacks, MRSA, pneumonia and cancer.

Now on his ‘ninth life’, he describes himself as ‘the unluckiest man I know, but the luckiest man in Britain’ over his string of escapes.

The first came when he and a group of friends decided to go for a swim in the sea during a trip to Ireland.

Mr Hawksley did not realise the water was only 3ft deep and dived off a high pier – straight on to a bed of sharp rocks.

Incredibly, he survived the impact, but shattered the fifth vertebrae in his spine which caused him to have a heart attack as his lungs filled with water. His life had to be saved four times within the next 30 minutes by first-aiders on the scene and paramedics who took him to hospital.

He awoke from a five-week coma and spent months recovering. But his brushes with death were far from over.

During his time in hospital he contracted life-threatening bouts of MRSA and pneumonia. Again he survived and, defying doctors’ initial expectations that he would never walk or talk again, he was back on his feet within months.

However, not long after his release from hospital, he was given the devastating news that he had testicular cancer.

The welder from Huntingdon, Cambridgshire, did not give up, and after receiving surgery, has now been given the all-clear. He said: ‘In lots of ways I feel like the unluckiest man I know – but I suppose I’m the luckiest man in Britain.

‘I have never really been down or upset. You just have to carry on.’

Mr Hawksley  was on a corporate weekend away in Grange, County Sligo, in June 2011 when the diving accident happened.

Survivor: Matthew Hawksley after he broke his neck diving

Amateur triathlete Matthew Hawksley, from Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, has already survived heart attacks, cancer and deadly viruses in his short life.

He said: ‘There is no doubt  I was 
saved by people who pulled me from the water and who knew exactly what 
to do. I went into cardiac arrest numerous times that morning. I owe so 
much to all who tended to me.’

He
was moved to the Mater hospital in Dublin where his family and 
hairdresser girlfriend Avril Maleham, 20, had to make the decision to go
ahead with a risky spinal operation while he was in a coma.

‘I
woke up and I was completely paralysed. I could only see 
black-and-white shapes and could only communicate by blinking and 
sticking my tongue out. My family was told it was unlikely I would speak
again and I probably would spend my life in a wheelchair controlled by 
my chin.’

Just five months after the accident he took his first steps.

However,
during his time recovering at a care home, he was given the next batch 
of devastating news after doctors found a tumour.

He said: ‘The realisation it was possible that I would be paralysed for the rest of my life had been very real.

Matthew swan-dived into rocks at the end of the small pier (pictured) in Sligo when he was on holiday with fellow welder friends in 2011.

Matthew is pictured here shortly after his fall when he broke his neck. The injury could have killed him and he was told he may never walk again. He has since made a full recovery.

Matthew's girlfriend Avril Maleham (left) and his family were forced to make life-changing decisions for welder Matthew while he remained in a five-week coma after his accident.

‘Then to get through that and find out I had cancer was a massive blow.’

The
amateur triathlete, who had taken part in a race in Sligo in the days 
before his diving ordeal, last month revisited the scene of the 
accident.

Less than two
years on, he is planning to run, swim and cycle in a triathlon in aid 
of cancer and spinal cord injury charities. He said: ‘You can’t let 
yourself down. You have to pick yourself up and work with what you’ve 
got.’
