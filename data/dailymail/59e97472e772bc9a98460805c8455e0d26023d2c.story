'Troubling case': Mr Justice Cobb granted an injunction preventing the baby from being removed from the care of the health manager

Social services tried to take a baby girl away from an adoptive mother after they discovered she had been blinded by a brain tumour operation.

The woman returned from hospital to find a social worker on her doorstep, ready to make a judgement on the child’s fate.

Today a High Court judge stopped social workers from removing the baby until there is a full court decision, calling the case ‘troubling’.

He also criticised the unnamed London council that had tried to take the baby away.

Mr Justice Cobb QC said the local authority had failed to look into the would-be mother’s state of health, to offer her any support to bring up the child while disabled, or to consider that the baby now ‘finds her home’ in the woman’s arms.

The baby girl, named in court only as SB, was born 13 weeks premature in February last year, weighing only 2lb 4oz, and with a cleft palate.

She was abandoned by her mother and spent many months in hospital before being placed with the adoptive mother, a single woman who works as a project manager for the NHS.

At the end of last year, the woman was diagnosed with a brain tumour after she found her sight deteriorating. Leaving the child to be cared for by friends, she went into hospital where the tumour was successfully removed in surgery.

But the woman was left without sight and it may never return.

In court: The single health manager began legal action at the High Court when a local authority tried to remove a one-year-old baby from her care after she lost her sight

She returned from hospital in January to find the social worker waiting on her doorstep.

Mr Justice Cobb said in a ruling 
published yesterday that the council’s decision to take the baby away 
from the woman was based on the opinions of the social worker formed on 
‘the very day when she was discharged from hospital after her 
operation’.

He added: ‘One can only imagine the 
tumult of emotions which she must have been feeling on that day – joy 
and relief to be at home and with the baby; sickening anxiety and 
possibly despair at her new disability.’

The judge said the social worker had 
noticed the year-old baby bat the woman’s face with her hands when the 
adoptive mother failed to notice her expressions.

The social worker wrote this was ‘a 
small indicator of the difficulties she is most likely to face in her 
efforts to build an attachment with SB’.

Shortly afterwards the council told 
the woman the child would be removed, threatening her with criminal 
prosecution if she failed to co-operate.

In his ruling, the judge said the 
baby should remain with the adoptive mother for now and that her 
treatment by social workers was unfair.

He added: ‘Visual impairment does not of itself disqualify an adult from being a capable loving parent.
‘The ability of the woman to provide good emotional care for SB needs to be properly assessed.
‘It was not fairly assessed when the social worker visited the woman’s home so soon after her discharge  from hospital.’

The judge said that the council  had not offered practical support to the woman, despite her requests  for help.

He said she depends on her friends to
cope with the baby, adding: ‘Whether this is indeed the optimal 
long-term care arrangement for SB remains to be seen.’

He advised the council to provide the
support she has asked for, saying that a care assistant or nanny to 
help her may be the best option.
