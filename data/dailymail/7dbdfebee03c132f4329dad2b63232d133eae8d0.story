National Guard troops stationed on the Texas-Mexico border can't arrest illegal immigrants, but Texas Gov. Rick Perry says the deterrent factor makes sending the troops there worthwhile.

'It's a powerful reminder that what you are doing is a crime,' Perry told an online news outlet run by the conservative Heritage Foundation.

'It's just like a law enforcement effort in your neighborhood, where you see a parked patrol police car on the corner, and the bad guys see it and don’t commit a crime.'

Texas Governor Rick Perry announced on July 28 that he would deploy up to 1,000 National Guard troops along the Texas-Mexico border to assist the U.S. Border Patrol in stopping illegal immigration

He told the news website The Daily Signal that it was his decision to keep his state's National Guard detachment out of the law-enforcement business. 'Their real job is not apprehension,' Perry said. 'Border Patrol apprehends.'

But many of those federal agents have been re-tasked in recent months to glorified babysitting duties, caring for the hundreds of unaccompanied minors flooding the border.

Public outcry, especially among Texas ranchers and tea party groups, drove Perry to deploy the National Guard.

He said Tuesday that U.S. Border Patrol agents will be grateful for the help.

'They aren’t displacing Border Patrol,' Perry said of the National Guard troops, who will number as many as 1,000.

'It'll be just like how we partner with law enforcement. They want to see the border secure, so they won’t resist the assistance. Just the presence and knowledge that they’re deployed will have a powerful message.'

The National Guard will mostly work alongside state law-enforcement officers deployed at the  border by Perry earlier this month.

'For those who say, "This is very out of the ordinary," the National Guard being at the border is not an unusual situation,' he added. 'There’s troops at the border every year and there’s troops there now.'

President George W. Bush ordered National Guard units to patrol America's southwest border in 2006. President Barack Obama extended that order in 2010.

But his 2012 executive order of a virtual amnesty for hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children before 2007 has led to a wave of Central American children and teens seeking the same treatment.

With that development, existing border security measures have proven inadequate.

Obama visited Texas just weeks ago but decided not to visit the border region. Perry later said that during a private meeting, Obama conceded that he was unaware most U.S. Border Patrol officers were stationed dozens of miles inside the United States – not on the border itself.

That arrangement has left them powerless to detain illegal immigrants until they are in the United States.

Perry's deployment of Texas Department of Public Safety officers followed that meeting.

'The responsibility for securing the border rests exclusively on the federal government,' Perry wrote to that agency's director on June 18.

'The federal government's failure to secure the border has created an incentive for families to send their children on a dangerous, and sometimes fatal, journey.'

'Until the federal government fulfills its duty,' Perry declared, 'it falls on the State of Texas to address those obligations.'
