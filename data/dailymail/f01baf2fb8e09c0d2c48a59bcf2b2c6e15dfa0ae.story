A young schoolgirl was horrified to discover six metal nails in her chicken and chips from the family's favourite local takeaway.

Mollie Howe, 11, had been just about to tuck in to her tea when she spotted the inch-long nails in the £1.30 meal.

Her furious mother, Sharon Howe, 39, has now blasted the Red Rooster fast food outlet, in Dagenham, Essex, which served her daughter the dangerous meal.

Ms Howe said: 'I'm just so glad Mollie didn't eat it - who knows what might have happened? She came home, opened it up and there were these six nails - just like the ones you hammer into the wall.

'It's even more worrying because my dad could have eaten it as he often goes there too. He's 81 and lives on his own.'

Ms Howe, of Dagenham, Essex, added that her family had been regular customers at the Red Rooster takeaway for years - but none of them will be going back.

'It's almost an everyday thing because it's cheap and cheerful. But I definitely won't be going there again - it just isn't worth the risk,' said the mother-of-two.

The lethal inch-long metal nails were discovered nestled amongst the 11-year-old's chicken and chips 

Maumand Khan, who works at Red Rooster (pictured) apologised and said he was baffled as to how the nails had got into the schoolgirl's food

'None of my family and friends will be using it either.

'I just want people to be aware of what happened because it could have been a lot worse if poor Mollie had started eating and swallowed those nails.'

Ms Howe said she was so outraged that she immediately went to confront staff at Red Rooster with her son Reece Hare, 21.

'I was so angry that my son wouldn't even let me go in there to see them,' she admitted. 'He went in instead and told them about it and they just wanted to offer him more food - it's not good enough.'

Maumand Khan, who works at the takeaway, said he was baffled as to how the nails had got into Mollie's food.

Mr Khan said: 'We are terribly sorry, but we can't understand how this has happened.

'We don't have that kind of nail anywhere in the shop.'

He said they had not had any other complaints of this nature since the Red Rooster opened back in 2000.

Furious Ms Howe, 39, has now said the family will never return to their local takeaway, which they used to visit on an almost daily basis
