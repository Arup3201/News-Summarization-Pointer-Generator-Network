We've just had the most high-tech Christmas ever, with huge sales of PlayStations, Xboxes and even internet-linked dolls.

But 2015 is set to be the year of the retro toy, partly as a result of television trends.

Old favourites returning to our screens include The Wombles, the Clangers and Danger Mouse with his sidekick Penfold.

The Clangers first broadcast on the BBC from 1969 - 1972, but a new series is in production

Sooty and Sweep puppets are likely to return to the shop shelves, toy experts say

SuperTed will also be back in 2016.

A toy fair at Olympia in London this week also features a Tiny Tears doll, a new James Bond Aston Martin DB5 by Corgi, and Thunderbirds spin-offs such as a Tracy Island playset, which a generation ago sold 450,000 in three years.

Sooty and Sweep puppets, Care Bears and Bagpuss toys will all also be back on the shelves, experts say.

Natasha Crookes, of the British Toy and Hobby Association, said 2015 would be an unusual year.

‘Not only are there a lot of anniversaries but there are a number of shows returning for the next generation,’ she said.
