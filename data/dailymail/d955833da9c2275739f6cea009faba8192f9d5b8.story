Back in jail: Burglar Brandon Chomyn has returned to prison despite having apparently reformed

A burglar who was held up by politicians as a major success story for the justice system has returned to jail after resuming his life of crime.

Brandon Chomyn had vowed to turn his life around, working hard to gain qualifications while on probation, and earned a meeting with the Home Secretary in January this year.

But although he sent off applications for more than 50 jobs, not a single employer offered him an interview or even acknowledged his receiving his CV.

He went back to earning a living 'the only way he knows how', a court heard, and burgled a house in June.

Chomyn, 34, was jailed for three months at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday after admitting to the crime, in which he stole £170 cash.

Judge David Pugsley told him: 'In prison you learnt things that would help you find a job, but when you came out you didn't even get a reply to your applications.

'That is something lots of people with unblemished characters have to deal with, and don't think I'm unsympathetic to that.

'It is tough, especially in this area. But burgling other people's houses isn't the answer.'

Stoke-on-Trent has some of highest levels of unemployment in the country, with nearly 3,000 people currently out of work.

Theresa May visited the city earlier this year to learn about the local police's Integrated Offender Management programme, which targets prolific offenders, and met Chomyn during her trip.

Meeting: Chomyn was hailed as a success story by Home Secretary Theresa May

Robert Smith, defending, told the court: 'Mr Chomyn's explanation is that since coming out of custody where he had completed courses such as NVQs, he applied for 50 jobs.

'In doing so he was frank about his history, and never got an interview, or an acknowledgement. But he continued to do well, that is the picture painted by the probation officer.

'He did so well he was invited to a meeting with the Home Secretary. He was presented as a model of compliance.'

However, following his release, 
Chomyn was put in accommodation by crime reduction charity Nacro, which 
put him back in touch with other offenders.

Mr Smith added: 'He was living with people who had committed the same sort of offences, people he had learnt to move away from.

'He
was desperate. He couldn't obtain work. His girlfriend's benefits had 
been stopped. So they were both living on £70 a fortnight. This is why 
these offences were committed.

'He decided to make a living the only way he knew how.'

Chomyn
asked for another two break-ins to be taken into account, taking his 
total number of convictions for burglary up to eight.
