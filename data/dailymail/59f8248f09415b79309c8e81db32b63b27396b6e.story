Michael Schumacher has sold his Norwegian mountain holiday home for £2million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries.

The sale of the retreat, in Trysil, north of Oslo, comes after it was revealed last year that his family was planning to build a £10million 'hospital' room for the Formula One star at their home in Switzerland.

The 46-year-old had owned the 6,940 sq ft lodge since the 1990s and used it as a base for family skiing trips.

But the home, which features a spa, a cabin on nearby ski slopes and space for seven cars, has been sold to a foreign buyer for 22 million Norwegian kroner.

The Local reports Petter Birkrem from the PRIVATmegleren estate agent as telling the DN newspaper: 'It was his refuge from the media pursuit he has suffered throughout his life.

Mr Birkrem revealed that the buyer was not Norwegian adding: 'We had a viewing for this person and his family at the very start of winter. They got a real "wow" feeling when they came into the cabin.'

The Local reports that earlier plans to sell the house were put on hold because of the seven-time World Champion's devastating accident.

Mr Birkrem's firm is understood to have avoided using pictures of the home's interior while advertising the property. 

Prospective buyers were said to have been asked to leave cameras and mobile phones outside before viewing the building. 

Representatives for the Schumacher family declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline. 

Road to recovery: Schumacher (pictured with wife Corinna in 2004) was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France when the accident happened in December 2013

Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened in December 2013.

He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers.

But shortly after 11am, he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates.  

It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock.

He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. 

The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident.

Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry Prosecutor Patrick Quincy closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out.

He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run.

Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specializes in head injuries. 

He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain.

At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma.

Since September last year he has been looked after by medical experts at his home in Gland, Switzerland. 

His family is believed to have an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds.
