Wigan Athletic are poised to follow up the signing of Inverness striker Billy McKay with a £1.5million double swoop on Leeds United.

After scoring 10 goals for The Jags this season, Inverness had hoped to keep McKay until the summer in a quest to consolidate their push for Europe.

But Wigan confirmed the deal had gone through on Wednesday, and boss Malky Mackay is still on the lookout to further bolster his squad.

Having already agreed terms with Leeds centre-back Jason Pearce, Mackay has now added Leeds midfielder Rodolph Austin to the deal.

The Latics will also have their work cut out in trying to lure Feyenoord's Mitchell te Vrede to the DW Stadium.

The Dutch side rejected Wigan's bid for the striker, who has five goals in the Eredivisie this term.
