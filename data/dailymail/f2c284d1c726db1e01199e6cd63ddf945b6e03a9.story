Defiant: Prime Minister David Cameron insisted he would continue with plans to reduce the deficit in spite of a huge spike in the number of people unemployed

The young, women working part-time and the elderly yesterday emerged as the main victims as the worst unemployment figures for 17 years were announced.

Between June and August the total number of unemployed people rocketed by 114,000 – equal to about 8,800 jobs being lost every week – leaving 2.56million people out of work.

As the total climbed to its highest level since 1994, in those few months a record 74,000 over-65s were pushed out of work – just weeks before new retirement rules came into force on October 1 which ban employers from getting rid of workers because of their age.

Youth unemployment also rose by 74,000 to a record 991,000, raising fears it could breach the one million mark within months. This leaves more than one in five 16 to 24 year olds out of work.

Part-time posts also fell by a record 175,000 in the three months to August, which has pushed unemployment rates for women up to record levels.

During bitter exchanges in the House of Commons yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron admitted that the figures from the Office for National Statistics were ‘very disappointing’, adding that the Government has to ‘do more to get our economy moving’.

But he insisted the Coalition’s deficit reduction plans must not be abandoned, arguing that a U-turn would send interest rates soaring and the economy ‘into a tailspin’.

Labour said the figures were ‘a day of judgment’ and called for a new economic plan to kickstart growth.

Concerns at the increasing number of young people unable to get a job led Michael Saunders, an economist from the investment bank Citigroup, to say there is a ‘strong need’ for direct measures to encourage firms to take them on.

Worrying trend: Young people queue outside a job centre in a stunt to publicise the record level of youth unemployment

These include lowering National 
Insurance rates or cutting the national minimum wage, which was recently
 increased by 15p to £6.08 an hour for those aged 21 and above and 
raised 6p to £4.98 per hour for 18 to 20 year olds.

Martina Milburn, of The Prince’s 
Trust, added: ‘The number of unemployed young people is now almost twice
 the population of Manchester. If we fail to tackle youth unemployment 
now we risk losing this talent forever, which would be a tragedy.’

Tanya de Grunwald, founder of 
Graduate Fog, a job-hunting website, said: ‘Every day I hear from young 
people who are desperately struggling to find work.

Most are searching high and low and 
would take anything they were offered. More often than not, employers 
don’t even bother to write and tell them they haven’t got the job.’

Experts also raised fears that bosses
 employed a policy of ‘clearing the decks’ ahead of new retirement 
rules. Before October 1, a boss could simply tell a worker to leave when
 he or she reached retirement age, a practice which has now been banned.

Chris Ball of The Age and Employment
 Network, a group which campaigns for the rights of older workers, said 
the figures raise ‘serious questions’ for the Government about the rule 
change.

He added: ‘Has the scrapping of the 
default retirement age prompted employers to clear the decks ahead of 
the October milestone, denying older people the chance to work and save 
for longer?’

For those who have survived the 
recession, the figures show that the average private sector worker got a
 rise of just 1.8 per cent which, with inflation at 4.5 per cent, is the
 equivalent of a pay cut.

The British Chambers of Commerce warned yesterday that unemployment will keep on rising.

Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, said: 'The Tories and Lib Dems' big gamble that private sector growth would create enough jobs to compensate for their cuts in public sector jobs has not come off, as the rise to 2.57 million without jobs shows.

'In the middle of the worst international recession for 80 years, the Government itself is creating unemployment, with 250,000 public sector posts already gone and still more to come.

'These posts could have been available to the 2.57 million workers now facing the despair of mass unemployment.

'Government policy is hurting but it's not working. The squandering of human talent through unemployment is a crime that will haunt future generations.'

Employment Minister Chris Grayling 
said: 'It is clear that we are seeing the effect of the international 
economic crisis on the UK labour market.

'That's
 why last week we announced the right-to-buy housing scheme to support 
growth and today we are offering more support for jobseekers as 
sector-based work academies come on stream, combining real training, 
work experience and a guaranteed interview.

'Our
 new Work Programme is now up and running and offers people who have 
lost their jobs flexible, tailored support to get back into jobs and 
stay there.'

The Government
 said it was taking steps to support growth and rebalance the economy, 
including the creation of 11 new enterprise zones, designed to boost 
local growth and create more than 30,000 new jobs by 2015, four annual 
reductions in corporation tax, cutting the small companies rate, 
expanding loan guarantees and investing in science and apprenticeships.

Other figures showed that the number 
of people classed as economically inactive increased by 26,000 to 9.35 
million, a rate of 23.3 per cent.

Taking the inactivity rate and the 
new jobless figures together, half of 16 to 24-year-olds are now not 
employed, it was revealed.
