Arsenal are dark horses to win the Premier League title next season after signing Alexis Sanchez, according to former Tottenham chairman Lord Alan Sugar.

Sugar, who was in charge at White Hart Lane between 1991 and 2001 and still supports Spurs, believes the Gunners could upset the odds to finish above favourites Chelsea and Manchester City.

He told Sky Sports News HQ: 'It hurts me to say this but I think Arsenal could be the dark horse here.

Rival: Tottenham fan, Sugar, admitted it hurt him to admit Arsenal could win the Premier League  

'He (Wenger) lost (Theo) Walcott to serious injury, he lost (Aaron) Ramsey and he still managed to end up in the position he did.'

Despite the Gunners' promising form in the league last season, Arsene Wenger's men were forced to settle for fourth place and victory in the FA Cup final against Hull.

But Sugar believes the £30million acquisition of Sanchez from Barcelona could push them to the next level. 

He added: 'With a fit squad and the addition of the new chap that he’s brought in (Sanchez) I think they are the dark horse.'
