If you think it’s been hot here, spare a thought for these tiger cubs. The pair were captured on camera cooling off in water as temperatures in Rajasthan, India, soared to 44C.

Their mother, a Bengal tiger named Noor, had given birth to the cubs only three months before.

She kept them sheltered in a cave at Ranthambore National Park until the heat became too much and she walked them down to a shallow pond to cool off. Wildlife photographer Andy Rouse, from Wales, said he and his friends were the first people to see the cubs.

Mr Rouse said: ‘We were driving around and saw her in the road. Then we saw she had her cubs with her — one was running around, so she picked it up in her mouth and walked the cubs down to the water to cool off. I’ve encountered a lot of wildlife, but this is one of my highlights. It’s an extremely rare thing to see.’
