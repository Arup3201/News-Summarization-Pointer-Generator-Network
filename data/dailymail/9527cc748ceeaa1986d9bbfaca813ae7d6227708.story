Slip: Lorraine Card, 54, was left housebound, suffered horrific bruising and pulled every muscle in her leg after she slipped in dog mess on a pavement

A woman was left housebound, suffered horrific bruising and pulled every muscle and ligament in her leg after she slipped in dog mess on a pavement.

Lorraine Card, 54, was on the way to 
visit her elderly mother in hospital when she slid on the waste and 
landed heavily on her hip.

She was rushed to hospital by paramedics 
who gave her morphine to help her cope with the pain of pulling every 
single muscle and ligament in her leg.

Ms Card has been unable to leave her home since the accident two weeks ago, forcing her to take time off work and leaving her struggling to pay her bills.

'I left home, walked along the road and just slipped,' said care home worker Ms Card, of Yeovil, Somerset

'I fell onto my side and obviously I fell really hard.

'I tried to get up but I couldn't - my leg wouldn't take my weight.

'I hardly knew what was going on. I cannot explain the pain I was in. I nearly blacked out. I have never known pain like it.

'I sort of hobbled over to a near-by door way by the hairdressers, using my hand to help me. I managed to call my sister and my brother-in-law rang for an ambulance.'

Ms Card thought she might have broken her pelvis and hip bone during the fall near her home on February 28, but an X-ray revealed ligaments and muscle damage.

She now wants to warn dog owners of the serious consequences of not clearing up after their pets on pavement and roads.

'If it had been an older person they may not have survived - that's the scary thing,' she said.

'People need to realise what can happen if they don't pick it up.

'It's not just some poo on the road, it could have serious consequences.

'I have had to take time off work and I don't know how I am going to pay next month's rent.

'I live in a second-floor flat and I am reliant on others to bring me my shopping.'

Ms Card was on her way to visit her 82-year-old mother in hospital when she fell.

She said: 'My mum was admitted to hospital the day before with a suspected mini stroke and they were already struggling to keep her blood pressure down.

'When she found out about my accident she was so worried it shot straight back up again.'

A spokesman for South Somerset District Council said the council is currently experiencing a high number of complaints about dog fouling in Yeovil.

'The number of complaints always rises in the winter but this could also be due to the fact that most green spaces and areas suitable for walking dogs, are waterlogged and therefore, dogs are being exercised within the towns and villages,' she said.

'Enforcement officers regularly patrol parks and open spaces to ensure that people exercising their dogs are abiding by the law.

'A fine of Â£80 can be enforced if a witness is willing to provide a statement.'
