A young woman told a life-saving operation on a deadly brain tumour would probably leave her with special needs has defied doctors' predictions - and graduated from university with a teaching degree.

Hannah Jones, 21, had to learn how to walk and talk again after suffering a stroke during an operation to remove a cancerous tumour on her brain.

She had made the brave decision to go ahead with surgery despite doctors warning it could leave her permanently disabled and with a reduced level of intelligence.

Hannah Jones, 21, graduated  from the University of Chester with a 2:1 Honours degree in Education - despite doctors warning an operation to remove a brain tumour would leave her with special needs

Miss Jones underwent three operations in total to remove the cancer cells from her brain, suffering a stroke during the last procedure which left her unable to walk and talk. She is pictured left after her first operation, and right having some of her hair removed during treatment

Amazingly, Miss Jones defied expectations and managed to re-learn to walk and talk. Her parents, Steve and Dianne Jones (pictured) said they are 'so proud of everything Hannah has achieved'

But amazingly, she defied all their predictions - and has now made so much progress she has graduated from the University of Chester with a 2:1 Honours degree in Education.

She now plans to work in a school for children with special needs.

Miss Jones, from Chester, Cheshire, said: 'My three years at uni has been really, really hard. I've still been having treatment and it's been exhausting.

'There were times where I wanted to give up, but my family and tutors were so supportive and kept me going. I'm so happy that I finally got here.

'I'd always wanted to go to university and train to be a teacher, but surgeons told me that the operation I needed to save my life would probably make that impossible.

'I was told that the radiotherapy, chemotherapy and operations would cause so much damage that I would never be able to sit A-levels, never mind go to uni. 

'I've always wanted to teach, but especially after I got ill, I wanted to work with special needs children, because I feel I have a better understanding of what they're going through.

'I have just got a job as a teaching assistant in a special educational needs school, and get a great deal of satisfaction from working with children who face many challenges ahead.'

Doctors first discovered the four centimetre tumour growing in Hannah's brain six years ago.

After two risky operations to remove it, neurosurgeon Conor Mallucci told the family her only option was a third operation, which would scrape tumour cells away from an artery deep in her brain - but that it would almost certainly trigger a stroke.

Miss Jones had the operation in August 2009, and suffered a major stroke while she was in theatre at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool.

When she came round, she was unable to talk, stand or even eat by herself, and had to begin the journey to recovery, despite doctors warning it was likely she would be left with special needs.

It took four months for Hannah to even be able to stand by herself - but her progress stunned doctors, and she slowly relearned how to do everything she was able to before.

During her final operation, surgeons carried out a rare procedure where they inserted 'wafers' into Hannah's brain - that constantly release small doses of chemotherapy.

And despite medics fearing that Miss Jones' tumour would soon return, it has remained at bay for five years.

Miss Jones won a WellChild award - a bravery award given to children with serious medical conditions. As her prize she was sent to fly an aircraft

Miss Jones remembers that others have not been so lucky.

She said: 'I met one of my best friends, Christie Butler, while I was having treatment, but sadly, she didn't survive her tumour. 

Before she passed away, she bought me a beautiful necklace, that I wore on my graduation day. I knew she would want to be there with me.' 

Her father Steve, a university lecturer, added: 'We are so proud of Hannah and everything she's achieved, but we know we are incredibly lucky.

'So many people who have brain tumours don't make it to that five year point, and Hannah has tirelessly raised funds for the Brain Tumour Charity, regardless of how busy or unwell she has been.

'Her mother and I are so proud of both our daughters.'
