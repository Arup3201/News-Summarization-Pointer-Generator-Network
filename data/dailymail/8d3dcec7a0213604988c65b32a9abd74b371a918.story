The 20-year-old man arrested today in connection with the killing of a seven-year-old girl lived and worked at the same apartment complex where she disappeared.

Ryan Brunn was a maintenance worker at the complex and tips from the public led investigators to him, investigators said.

Jorelys Rivera was abducted, stabbed and sexually assaulted before her body
was thrown in a bin at the complex in Canton, Georgia.

Autopsy results showed the girl died of blows to the head.

Arrested: Ryan Brunn, 20, worked at the apartment complex where the body of Jorelys Rivera, seven, was found in Canton, Georgia

Picture of innocence: The body of seven-year-old Jorelys Rivera was found sexually assaulted and beaten to death in a dumpster near her home after she went missing on Friday evening

Brunn doesn't have a criminal history  but Georgia Bureau of Investigation director Vernon Keenan told reporters: 'We are confident that Brunn is the killer and that is why he is in custody.'

Prior to being arrested on murder charges today at 12.40 pm, Brunn had been under surveillance.

Jorelys Rivera was last seen on Friday evening at 5pm leaving a playground at her apartment complex.

The chief investigator into the death of Jorelys Rivera was so distraught over the girl's wounds he refused to describe them yesterday.

The
seven-year-old girl, whose body was found in a Georgia dumpster, was 
bludgeoned, sexually assaulted and stabbed in a particularly vicious 
attack by a killer who police believe lives in her apartment complex. 

Keenan said Brunn had keys to both the empty apartment and the trash compactor bin where Rivera's body was placed.

Suspect: Ryan Brunn was arrested over the death of Jorelys Rivera, seven. Veteran detectives struggled to speak about her death because the injuries she suffered were so severe

The wounds to her body were so severe Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vernon Keenan would not give any details.

Mr Keenan would only say she had 
blunt force trauma to the head and stab wounds and that the crime as a 
'very horrific and brutal murder.'

Brunn's Facebook page, which was public but has since been taken down, said he is originally from Brooklyn and speaks both Spanish and English.

The information section said: 'Hello! I'm Ryan I live in Canton GA I have a wonderful Life/Family/Friends. Im very outgoing not shy at all so if ya wanna get to no me hit me up. :-)'

Recent entries were filled with sports references. The last post on November 28, read: 'Gettin off here bout to eat some PIZZA! Hit me up! Lets go GIANTS.'

In an entry dated July 6, Brunn appeared to be commenting on the July 5 Casey Anthony acquittal.

He appeared to have moved to Canton on November 5, which he refers to as 'moving day' on Facebook."Not ready to go but i got to," he wrote. "Im gonna miss yall/Dahlonega... I Love yall hit me up n we'll do something sometime.. Got my own place now. :-)"

Investigators are working to piece together Brunn's back story.

Police said the girl was taken to a
vacant apartment where she was sexually assaulted, stabbed and beaten 
to death.

The killer then threw Jorelys Rivera's brutally disfigured body into a trash bin near her home in Canton, Georgia where it was found by police.

It came about 60 to 90 minutes after she disappeared, he said.

This was a very calculated and planned crime,’ Keenan said. 'A child who dies under extreme violence is absolutely the worst thing that can happen to a human being.'

DNA evidence had been collected from the 
child's body and the vacant apartment.

Rivera was last seen on Friday afternoon, and her body was discovered around 12.30 pm on Monday.

Police and volunteers had spent the weekend combing the area around the apartment complex playground where she was last seen.

At the time of her disappearance, the child was being looked after by a teenage babysitter along with her two siblings.

She had left the park to go and collect 
drinks from home for her friends, and disappeared between the playground
and her home at the River Ridge Apartments.

Brunn began working for the apartment
complex last month, according to residents and his Facebook page. He 
had previously lived in Dahlonega, Georgia, and Dumfries, Virginia.

Captured: Brunn was arrested Wednesday in connection with the killing of seven-year-old Jorelys Rivera of Canton, Georgia after she disappeared after leaving a play park on Friday evening

Grim task: Investigators comb through piles of garbage from a trash container where the body of 7-year-old Jorelys Rivera was found

His mother, Karen-Ann Whiteley, filed for bankruptcy last month. She lives in Dahlonega, about 50 miles northeast of Canton where the killing happened.

In July, when Florida resident Casey Anthony was acquitted on charges she killed her daughter, Brunn wrote on Facebook that Anthony will 'get hers'.

Nancy Hudgins, 57, who lives near trash bin where Rivera's body was found, said she talked with Brunn on Monday as police searched apartments in the complex for clues.

She said Brunn told her that he was nervous about allowing officers into his apartment because he had beer bottles and is not of legal drinking age.

'He was just kind of scared about them going in,' she said.

Autopsy: The little girl died from a blunt head trauma an hour after she went missing while on her way to collect drinks for her friends

Taken: Police believe she was then taken to an empty apartment, sexually abused and beaten before being dumped in the trash

Distraught: Jorelys' mother Joselin had appealed for her daughter's safe return

Police had sent several Coca-Cola 
cans found nearby for forensic testing to see if these are the drinks 
that the child had gone to collect for her friends.

Jorelys' mother Joselin Rivera had made 
an emotional plea for her return and her father, who lives in Florida, 
had flown to the city in Cherokee County.

A friend translated for Spanish-speaking Mrs Rivera to local TV station 11alive.com.

She said her daughter was 'friendly, sweet, had lots of friends and everyone just loved her'.

Keenan said investigators have 
received numerous tips from the public and said valuable evidence has 
come from residents at the apartment complex.

Several sex offenders living at the complex have been identified and interviewed, Keenan said.

But he added: ‘We have no reason to believe, at this point, that sex offenders are involved.’

About 65 local, state and federal 
investigators are working on the case and several hundred interviews 
have been conducted, authorities said.

Maria Rodriguez, a former resident of the apartment complex, said she works with Jorelys' mother at a nearby poultry plant.

Remembered: Children who lived near Jorelys pay respect to her in the park

Vigil: Neighbours and friends meet on the playground where Jorelys Rivera was last seen alive in Canton, Georgia to hold a candlelit vigil and leave gifts

‘She was a very sweet girl,’ Rodriguez 
said as she held her own four-year-old daughter. ‘She was the type of 
little girl who likes her presence to be known. It's just so sad.’

Police have removed two other young children from the Rivera home over ‘concern about the supervision of Jorelys,’ said Lt. Jay Baker with the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department.

A prayer vigil was held late Monday at the playground, where people left flowers, balloons and stuffed animals at a makeshift memorial for Jorelys.

Eerie: Authorities removed the dumpster in which the seven-year-old was found to a nearby field to search for evidence

Search: Authorities comb through piles of garbage from a dumpster where the body was found. They are also carrying out tests on the vacant apartment
