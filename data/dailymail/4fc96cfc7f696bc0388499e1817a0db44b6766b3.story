A riot involving 2,000 workers broke out at an Apple factory in China, leaving 40 people injured.

More than 5,000 police were reportedly sent to bring the riot at the Foxconn factory in the northern city of Taiyuan in the Shanxi province of China until control after trouble erupted in workers' sleeping quarters yesterday.

Comments on Chinese internet bulletin 
boards said the trouble may have been sparked by a security guard 
hitting an employee and not related to the recent anti-Japan protests.

In a statement, the Taiwanese-owned company said: 'A personal dispute between several employees escalated into an incident involving some 2,000 workers at approximately 11pm last night in a privately-managed dormitory.'

Around 2,000 workers at the Foxconn factory in the northern Chinese city
 of Taiyuan were involved in a mass brawl last night and 40 people were 
taken to hospital

The rioting at the factory which employs 79,000 workers continued for four hours, with 40 people being taken to hospital and a 'number of individuals being arrested'.

Production at the plant has been stopped today and the cause of the dispute is being investigated by local authorities. The company spokesman added 'it does not appear to have been work-related'.

Foxconn makes iPhones and iPads for Apple and also assembles products for Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. It is one of China's biggest employers, with some 1.2 million workers in factories in Taiyuan, the southern city of Shenzhen, in Chengdu in the west and in Zhengzhou in central China.

Photos uploaded by Li Tian to the Chinese site Sina Weibe were swiftly removed, but they show considerable damage including a burned vehicle, broken windows and lines of police with riot shields, helmets and clubs.

The incident happened in the city of Taiyuan in the north of China, situated to the south-west of Beijing

This is the second time in the last six months the site has seen workers unrest at the site. In March front-line workers went on strike after they failed to receive the promised pay rise.

Apple hired an auditor who found Foxconn employees regularly were required to work more than 60 hours a week. The company raised minimum pay and promised to limit hours.

There was a riot at Foxconn's Chengdu plant in June, which according to reports was due to an argument between some workers and a local 
restaurant owner.

Last night's rioting in the Taiyuan factory comes 11 days after an undercover journalist for the Shanghai Evening Post  strongly criticised working conditions at the plant where 57million iPhones are produced every year.

The journalist, who is keeping his identity secret, kept a diary of his ten day and website micgadget translated it.

Foxconn, which produces the iPhone 5, says it has closed down production today after windows were broken, cars were burned and 5,000 police officers had to be called in

Referring to living conditions at the dormitory next to the plant he wrote: ''The first night sleeping at Foxconn dormitory is a nightmare.

'The whole dormitory smells like garbage when I walked in.

'It’s a mixed of overnight garbage smell plus dirty sweat and foam smell.

'Outside every room was fully piled up with uncleared trash.

'When
 I opened my wardrobe, lots of cockroaches crawl out from inside and the
 bedsheets that are being distributed to every new workers are full of 
dirts and ashes.

'When 
someone has asked about the suicide issues, the management staff didn’t 
avoid the topic but not willing to discuss too much on it.

'During the suicide topic discussion, someone has voiced out that the bad living environment will sure lead to more suicides.

An investigation has been launched to find out what triggered the riot, it follows a strike at the factory in March over pay and working hours

'Also I have noticed that all the windows in the dormitory has been framed behind bars.'

Describing the relentless production-line work he was asked to carry out the journalist added:

'I have terrible neck-ache and muscle 
pain on my arm. A new worker who sat opposite of me got exhausted and 
laid down for a short while.

'The supervisor has noticed him and punished him by asking him to stand at one corner for 10 minutes like the old school days.

'We
 worked non-stop from midnight to the next morning 6 a.m but were still 
asked to keep on working as the production line is based on running belt
 and no one is allowed to stop. I’m so starving and fully exhausted.

'By
 my own calculations, I have to mark five iPhone plates every minute, at
 least. For every 10 hours, I have to accomplish 3,000 iPhone 5 back 
plates.
