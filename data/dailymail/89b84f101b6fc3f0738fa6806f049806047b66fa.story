Two Russian-themed WWE wrestling characters have sparked outrage by incorporating the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 disaster into their act.

In a show last night, the characters 'Lana' and 'Alexander Rusev' launched into an anti-American rant in which they made reference to the flight MH17 being shot down and hailed Russian president Vladimir Putin for 'making fools' out of the U.S..

The Rusev and Lana roles often use Cold War-style rhetoric as part of their act, but their mention of last week's MH17 disaster, in which 298 people died, has shocked the wrestling community.Â

Shocking: Wrestling fans took to Twitter to voice their anger at the mention of flight MH17

Role: WWE's Lana character is played by the American actress, who spent several years of her childhood in the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union

In early May this year, C.J. Perry's charter Lana began dedicating Rusev's matches to her 'hero', the President of Russia Vladimir Putin. She also ramped up her anti-American rhetoric

The characters involved in the controversy entered the world of WWE in January, amid heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S. over the ongoing crisis in the Ukraine.

The Rusev character is played by Bulgarian Miroslav Barnyashev, with his storyline focusing on the wrestler's move from the Balkans to Russia, and becoming a hardline supporter of Putin.

The use of a foreign 'baddie' to cause controversy is nothing new in the world of wrestling.

In 2005 WWE introduced the character Muhammad Hassan, a Middle Eastern Muslim wrestler who would often pray in the ring and speak about prejudice against Arabs - both of which were often greeted by boos.

The character came to an abrupt end when a controversial 'terrorism' storyline coincided with the 7/7 London bombings, leading television networks to pressure WWE into removing the character.
