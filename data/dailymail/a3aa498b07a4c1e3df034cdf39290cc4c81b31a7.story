Corrie fans are flocking to see the old Weatherfield set, spending up to £35,000 a day on tickets and souvenirs.

Up to 180 people an hour are allowed to walk down the famous cobbled streets, and the opening few weeks sold out before the attraction even opened.

The set, which is looking to welcome its 100,000th visitor on Wednesday next week, has become one of the busiest tourist attractions in the whole of Britain.

Tourists have been flocking from as far afield as New Zealand and Canada to take a tour of the old Coronation Street set, spending £35,000 a day on tickets on souvenirs

Despite only being open since April 5, nearly 100,000 people have walked down the famous cobbled streets

Visitors are able to take a tour of the old green room, the 'corridor of stars' with all the old dressing rooms, then visit Carla's flat, the Platts' and the Duckworths'

Fans from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand are travelling to the Quay Street set in Manchester in order to see inside Carla's flat, the Platts' and the Duckworths'.

The tour also takes in the old green room, where the celebrities relaxed on set, and the 'corridor of stars' where they can peak inside one of the old dressing rooms.

Other iconic artifacts are on display during the visit, including Deirdre's glasses and Roy's train set.

Tourists are then given time to wander around the set as they please, and can have their picture taken outside the Rovers Return.

Andy Begg, General Manager for Coronation Street the Tour said: "The response to the tour has been absolutely phenomenal with people travelling across the world so they can experience the wonder that is Weatherfield!

'We knew what we had was special but we didn't anticipate the level of demand for tickets and as such, have had to release additional capacity for evenings and weekends.

After more than 30 years at the old Quay Street set, the soap moved to a new set in Manchester's Media City. It took 3,000 builders more than two years to create and is paved with 54,000 cobbles

'Most pleasing of all is that everyone coming on the tour is really enjoying their time with us, from visiting the dressing rooms to having their photo taken behind the bar in the Rovers, to exploring the dark secrets of the “Ginnel”.

'I love seeing the visitor’s faces as they step out onto the street for the first time to the theme tune.

'Kids sprint down the cobbles, parents seek out their favourite landmarks and many visitors record themselves on their phones, recreating their favourite Corrie scenes.'

Coronation Street had been filmed at the site more than 30 years before it closed and moved to the new Media City in Manchester.
