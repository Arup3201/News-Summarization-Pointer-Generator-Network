This is the incredible moment that a mystery group of parachutists launched themselves off the top of a church spire - and landed in a market place just 210ft below.

The five daredevils, some of whom came from as far as Wales, jumped from the spire at Newark Parish Church, Nottinghamshire, after weeks of planning the elaborate stunt.

And the jumpers - who have all been 
jumping for at least five years - even used cameras to film the scene as they plunged down to the square below in the middle of the night.

A mystery group of parachutists launched themselves from the Newark church spire in Nottinghamshire - which is just 200ft high - and landed in a tiny market place

This sort of jump is known as a base jump, which involves jumping from a standing object, rather than from an aircraft.

The acronym stands for building, antenna, span and earth - the four places from which a base jumper can leap.

As with the more traditional jumps, the participant uses a parachute to break their fall.

Police have criticised the 'dangerous' jump and have now launched an investigation.

But one of the
 parachutists, who did not want to give his name, said the group spent two 
weeks analysing the area to ensure they jumped at a safe time.

He said: 'This was BASE jumping at its most difficult because the height was very low and it was very technical.

The five jumpers said they spent two weeks analysing the town, including what time the pubs closed, to ensure the jump took place at the safest time

The jumpers filmed the move - which took place in the middle of the night - on hand-held and helmet-mounted cameras

One of the jumpers, who has not been named, said the view from the top of the spire, looking down onto the market place, was 'fantastic'

The 200ft jump was said to be on the of most technical BASE jumps - which involves jumping off a static object - because of the low height of the spire

The phrase BASE jumping was coined by a filmmaker Carl Boenish - often seen as the father of BASE jumping - in 1978, when he filmed himself doing a jump in Yosemite National Park, America.

The acronym stands for building, antenna, span and earth - the four places from which a base jumper can leap.

Once a person has made a jump from each of the four categories, they can apply to have a BASE jump number, which are awarded in sequence.

The first people to be awarded a BASE number were Phil Smith and Phil Mayfield, who jumped together from a Houston skyscraper on 18 January 1981.

As of March 2014, more than 1,700 BASE numbers have been issues.

The world record for the highest BASE jump was recorded in April this year.

Fred Fugen and Vince Reffet jumped 2,717ft from the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

Other people had previously jumped from the building, but the duo jumped from a 500m platform to enable them to break the record.

BASE competitions, where the jumps are based on landing accuracy, have been held since the early 1980s.

The heights of the jumps vary between competitions, but a recent competition involved participants jumping from the 1,483ft high Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

'We’ve all been jumping for five or more years. We all come from 
experienced skydive backgrounds and lots of us also having climbing or 
mountaineering experience.

'We
 spent two weeks visiting, studying the movements of the town centre 
itself, what times the pubs closed, wind directions and studying 
turbulence around the tower.'

With the spire just 210ft from the ground, the parachutists had very little time to 
erect their parachute - making it an extremely challenging jump.

But the unnamed man said the jumpers were determined to complete the stunt because the spire is 'unique'.

So
 when they heard the spire was surrounded by scaffolding, as part of 
work being done to replace a weather vane, they decided to start 
arranging the jump.

The
 man said: 'We have military laser range-finding equipment so we know 
how high something is and the distance we’ve got to fly to get to 
safety.

'It does 
get very scientific and it takes hours and hours of planning. We were 
mindful not to do any damage to the fabric of the church.

'We are the first people ever to do it 
and for us that was part of the attraction because it was a unique 
object to jump from. It was spectacular up there and the view of the 
town was fantastic.'

Inspector Andy Gan, from Newark police, said the force had received calls about people being seen parachuting near the church.

He said: 'Obviously this is very dangerous and we strongly advise people not to do it.

'It’s also trespassing on church property, which is potentially going to cause damage to the church.

The jumpers say they are the first people to complete the jump. They said they wanted to jump from the spire because it is a 'unique object'

The parachutists were seen landed in the market square directly below the spire. It is one of the most technically-difficult BASE jumps, according to one of the team

BASE jumping, regarded by many as an extreme sport, involves participants leaping from a fixed object, rather than planes. It stands for building, atenna, span and earth, indicating the four places from which the person can jump

'It’s 
likely those who have done this are very experienced and if people think
 they can do something similar and come away unharmed that’s very 
unlikely.

'People shouldn’t try this. It is dangerous and could result in serious injury.'

According to an online ‘BASE fatality list’, 228 people have died doing base jumping since 1981.

Churchwarden Mike Pollard said: ‘It’s disappointing they have trespassed on church property.

'Although they haven’t done any harm, it could encourage others to climb the scaffolding. We are obviously concerned and not very happy about it.'

Work is now being carried out to make the scaffolding more secure, he said.
