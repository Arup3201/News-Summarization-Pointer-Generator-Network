Award winning comedian Sean Lock was hit with a £770 bill today for travelling in a first-class train carriage without a valid ticket

Award-winning comedian Sean Lock was hit with a £770 bill today for travelling in a first-class train carriage without a valid ticket.

Lock, 49, was found in a first-class seat on a Victoria-Littlehampton train and could only produce a standard class ticket.

The 2000 British Comedy Award winner refused to pay for a first-class ticket when approached by an inspector on the train near East Croydon, Tower Bridge Magistrates' Court was told.

Prosecutor Danny Butler said: ‘On the 6th April 2012, Sean Lock was spoken to on a Victoria-Littlehampton service near East Croydon.

‘He was in first class with a standard class ticket and when he was asked to pay, refused to do so.

‘A month later, he was written to asking to pay a penalty rather than undergo court action.

‘There was no response until two months later in July, he was again written to asking to pay the penalty rather than take court action.

‘By this point the matter had progressed to summons being issued.

‘There was still no response.

‘Clearly he has been written to previously and there had been no response to Southern Railways which means this is a Band A offence.'

Today was the fifth time the case had been listed after a summons was sent to his old address and not his new one.

The comic did not turn up to court today but was found guilty of occupying a reserved seat without valid ticket - a railway byelaw - in his absence.

The show draws on opinion polls and asks members of the public what they have been talking about each week.

He was fined £500 and ordered to pay costs of £220 with a victim surcharge of £50.
