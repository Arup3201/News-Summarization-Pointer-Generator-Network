When most people have their phone stolen, they get angry before moving on.

But for Danielle Bruckman, she decided to get even.

The woman, from San Francisco, has recreated a number of selfies taken by an eccentric moustachioed man who now has her misplaced phone.

Ms Bruckman created this hilarious parody after she lost her phone last New Year's Eve but discovered that pictures taken with it were still being synced to her Cloud backup system. The mystery man has uploaded some 250 photographs, almost all of them selfies.

In what has become perhaps an obsessive hobby, she has recreated the man’s 'killer moustache,' donning a fake moustache and chest hair, and replicating the poses and places for her ‘My Cloud Pal’ Tumblr page.

Double take? Danielle Bruckman (right) started parodying selfies taken by a moustachioed man (left) after she lost her phone a year ago but still had access to the photographs through her Cloud backup system

Calling it ‘one woman’s journey 
through another man’s selfies,’ she wrote: ‘On January 1, 2013 my phone
 escaped me and somehow fell into the hands of a man with a killer 
mustache.

‘Thanks to Apple and some kinks in the cloud, I receive all of his pictures in my photo stream. 

‘Here are his selfies as re-enacted by yours truly.’

Mirrored muscles: She donned a fake moustache and chest hair, and replicated his poses in the hilarious parody which has gone viral

Obsessive insight: Through the Cloud glitch, Ms Bruckman also has access to some of the man's contacts and knows that in 2013 he went on a health kick

According
 to BuzzFeed.com, she said: ‘He somehow grew on me and I actually enjoy 
getting his updates and see it as a window to peer into his daily life.

‘In a way, it's a selfie diary of sorts and now I can paint a more full picture of this man's life.’

The
 Cloud glitch has given Ms Bruckman access to many of the man’s 
contacts, where he works and the fact that he went on a diet this year.

'My Cloud pal': Ms Bruckman recreated many of the man's selfies posting them on her Tumblr page calling it 'one woman's journey through another man's selfies'

Snooze you loose: After having access to the selfies over the last year, Ms Bruckman said the man 'grew' on her and she enjoyed getting his updates

My take on tan time: Ms Bruckman goes into great details to recreate the photos (note the woman standing just behind the subject's shoulder)

Voyeuristic voyage: Along with the hilarious selfie replicas, Ms Bruckman urges people to send her their selfies, suggesting she might even parody them

She said: 'Props buddy. From the selfies we know he totally lost weight.'

She has also created various selfie-replicas of Hollywood actor James Franco which include photoshopping herself into crowd scenes and wearing a light brown moustache.

Ms Bruckman hopes her project will 
inspire others, putting a call out for others to send in their selfies 
to be featured on her site, suggesting she may even try to parody them.

Despite
 the popularity of the selfie trend – even earning an official 
definition in the Oxford Dictionary this year - the word has been vote 
the most annoying and overused term of 2013.

Double life: Ms Bruckman sees the glitch as an opportunity to 'peer into his life'

The annual list, created by the Lake Superior State University, is collated based on the official Banished Words Facebook page. 

The term was made popular in 2013 when celebrities began posting 'selfies' on Twitter and Instagram. 

Even
 U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron 
posed for a selfie with Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning Schmidt 
at Nelson Mandela's memorial earlier this month.

Other words that made the cut include 'twerk', 'hashtag', 'Twittersphere' and 'Obamacare’.
