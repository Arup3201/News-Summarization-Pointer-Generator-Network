England’s Young Lions were tamed by Holland as their Algarve Tournament campaign started with a chastening seven-goal thrashing on Friday afternoon.

Four down within 18 minutes and five behind by the break, this was far from the positive start England wanted in the competition designed to serve as their main preparation for this summer’s European Championship defence.

Indeed, it was Holland who England defeated on penalties in last year’s Euro final in Malta and they gained a handsome measure of revenge in Parchal on a Friday 13 horror show.

England fell to an embarrassing 7-0 defeat against Holland at the Algarve tournament

John Peacock’s side trailed inside five minutes when Feyenoord’s Rashaan Fernandes was played through, held off the challenge of Easah Suliman and slotted the ball past goalkeeper Aston Oxborough.

Things got worse five minutes later when Oxborough, the Norwich keeper, struck a clearance against his own defender Cameron Humphreys and watched as it rebounded back past him into the net.

It was three to the Dutch on 13 minutes when the lively Fernandes advanced down the right to the six-yard box and pulled the ball back to AZ Alkmaar man Teun Bijleveld to poke home.

England were shell-shocked and conceded another shortly afterwards. Once more, Fernandes burst forward on his right flank and crossed for Javairo Dilrosun, who is on Manchester City’s books, to volley in.

The Young Lions at least gained their composure at this point and even started to create some openings of their own. Leicester City forward Leyton Ndukwu got the better of two defenders before drawing a save from Dutch keeper Justin Bijlow.

On the half-hour, West Ham’s Jahmal Hector-Ingram set up Callum Gribbin, of Man United, but his curling effort was pushed clear by Bijlow.

There was just enough time before the break for Holland to add a fifth and it was Dilrosun again who capitalised.

The second half was pretty academic, with England playing only for pride. But they couldn’t get on the scoresheet and Holland added a couple more to really rub it in.

Jay-Roy Grot, on as a substitute, scored No 6 and Dilrosun completed his hat-trick with an excellent free-kick in the closing stages. Dilrosun, a 16-year-old left winger, joined City from Ajax last summer and has already featured for their under 18s in domestic competition and the under 19s in the UEFA Youth League.

England will have to regroup quickly as they take on Portugal in their second game on Sunday afternoon.
