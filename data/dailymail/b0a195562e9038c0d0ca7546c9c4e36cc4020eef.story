Volvo believe they have a perfect way to test a new steering system system on one of its new trucks.

Forget computer testing and expert examinations - the foolproof way is to let a hamster 'drive' the 16.5 ton monster.

Introducing Charlie, who, while being guided by a carrot in a circular cage placed on the steering wheel, managed to drive the Volvo FMX along a dangerous quarry edge in  Los Tres Cunados in northwestern Spain.

Off we go: Charlie is encourage to 'drive' the truck by chasing the carrot

Watch out: The hamster was given a dangerous expedition - guiding a 16.5 tonne truck

Gulp: The sheer danger of the test is excellently demonstrated by this still

Precision driver Seon Rogers uses the carrot as a tease to encourage the rodent in to traverse in the right direction, thus moving the wheel with it.

To those assembled on the rocky terrain, they are introduced to the project by Volvo technician Jan-Inge Svensson by being told they will witness the 'ultimate test of a steering system'. 

Fingers crossed: It's fair to say the co-driver was a tad worried

Dangerous: One wrong move and the truck could well career off the edge

Turn: It wasn't just a straight road the hamster had to navigate...

As if the crowd needed telling, the test area is described as 'beautiful but very, very dangerous.'

With a puff of his cheeks, which is more than likely mirrored by the those who view the video, Rogers begins the journey.

There are a few jerky moments, not least when the truck crashes into a rock by the side of the quarry which crashes into the water below.

But little Charlie holds his nerve, and with his desperation to catch the carrot, leads the truck over the finish line to everyone's relief.

Crash: The team are left open-mouthed when the truck clips a boulder...

...but thankfully it's just the boulder that topples over and hits the water

Phew! The steering passes the hamster test as the truck reaches the finish line
