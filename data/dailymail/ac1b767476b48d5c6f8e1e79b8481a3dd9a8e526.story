Mario Balotelli was slammed after swapping shirts with Pepe at half-time during Liverpool's Champions League humbling by Real Madrid on Wednesday night.

The striker, knowing he was about to be taken off by manager Brendan Rodgers following a poor 45 minutes, decided to grab himself a wearable souvenir a little earlier than is custom.

But although his actions attracted widespread criticism, it is by no means the first time two players have decided to swap shirts at half-time.

We take a look back at some of the other occasions when shirts have been swapped prematurely.

Andre Santos and Robin Van Persie

Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal - November 4, 2012

Andre Santos ran after his former team-mate and asked to swap shirts as the players headed down the Old Trafford tunnel.

Van Persie had just joined United for £24m and had scored after just three minutes of this match.

Santos was privately reprimanded by manager Arsene Wenger but claimed the half-time swapping of shirts is a custom in Brazil.

Unfortunately, that doesn't translate to England and Santos found himself a scapegoat for a poor team performance.

Neymar and Robinho

AC Milan 1-1 Barcelona - October 22, 2013

Neymar had paid tribute to his idol Robinho in the build-up to this Champions League tie last year and he seemed in a hurry to get his shirt.

Robinho had opened the scoring at the San Siro, only for Lionel Messi to equalise, and the two exchanged shirts as they walked off at the break.

Both players started their careers at Santos in Brazil before big money moves to Europe.

Mamadou Sakho and Samuel Eto'o

Chelsea 2-1 Liverpool - December 29, 2013

As referee Howard Webb blew for half-time at Stamford Bridge in this clash last season, Mamadou Sakho of Liverpool and Chelsea's Samuel Eto'o decided to get the swapping over and done with.

What's more, TV cameras also picked up Oscar and Philippe Coutinho, both Brazilians, swapping jerseys too.

It led to a backlash on Twitter, with fans calling for the players to be taken off at half-time.

Ronaldinho and Paolo Ferreira

Chelsea 4-2 Barcelona - March 8, 2005

This Champions League tie was a classic as Chelsea turned around a first-leg deficit to dump Barcelona out on a memorable evening at Stamford Bridge.

To add further intrigue, Ronaldinho and Ferreira decided to swap shirts as they trooped off at half-time.

The Brazilian star had scored twice during the opening period.

Xabi Alonso and Alonso Pirlo

Juventus 2-2 Real Madrid - November 5, 2013

These two midfield maestros couldn't wait to exchange shirts as two heavyweights of European football went head-to-head in Turin.

The group stage match ended 2-2, with Arturo Vidal and Fernando Llorente scoring for Juventus and Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale on target for Real.

PS Raja Casablanca and Ronaldinho

Casablanca vs Atletico Mineiro - December 18, 2013

The whole Raja Casablanca team wanted a memento from Ronaldinho after their FIFA Club World Cup win over Atletico Mineiro last year.

Players swarmed around the Brazilian idol, taking not only his shirt but his orange Nike boots as well.
