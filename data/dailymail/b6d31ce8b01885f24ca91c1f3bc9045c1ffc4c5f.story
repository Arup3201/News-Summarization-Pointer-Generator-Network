The Northern Territory is renowned for its natural beauty and these stunning Instagram photos prove it.

The photos were shot by Australia's top Instagrammers and capture the Top End's most iconic attractions from deep in Kakadu National Park to Arnhem Land and Katherine.

Northern Territory's tourism operator, Tourism NT, brought the photographers together for its first 'Instameet' last month where the prominent Instagram users showcased their work.

Their photos shone a light on the Northern Territory's colourful sunsets, vast wildlife, popular billabongs and deep gorges.

Among the photographers was Lauren Bath who gave up her job to become Australia's first professional Instagrammer.

'Since my first trip to the Northern Territory, I have been addicted to its amazing scenery, history and dusty red earth,' she said.

'Having had the opportunity to travel to Uluru twice, as well as other areas including Darwin, Kings Canyon and Alice Springs, I am more than keen to keep discovering and capturing the Northern Territory's endless hidden gems, only found in Australia's Red Centre and the Top End.'

The push on Instagram is the Northern Territory's new way of promoting the area and drawing in tourists.

'Using the global social phenomenon – Instagram – is just one of many innovative tools we are using to market the Territory as a holiday destination. It's a first for the Territory that will reflect the excitement of holidaying in the NT, particularly to younger people,' Minister for Tourism Matt Conlan said.

'The government's $8 million boost to the 2014 Tourism Budget will allow us to invest in social media initiatives like the Instameet as well as further advertising in Australia and internationally – in cooperation with travel agents, wholesalers and other distribution channels.'

Ms Bath is now part of Tourism NT's advocacy program, which has named several high profile Australians as 'Mates' so they can share their experiences from the Top End.

Channel Nine's Today host, Lisa Wilkinson, was named a Mate alongside Ms Bath this week.
