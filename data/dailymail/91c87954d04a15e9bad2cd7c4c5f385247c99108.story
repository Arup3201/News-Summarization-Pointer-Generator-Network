Greg Dyke controversially waded into the row over rapist footballer Ched Evans when he said it was ‘not an important issue’.

Speaking on BBC’s Newsnight, Mr Dyke appeared unprepared for questions over Evans’ comeback despite being chairman of the Football Association, looking uncomfortable as he told presenter Laura Kuenssberg the issue was ‘not clear cut’.

His gaffe came after Olympic golden girl Jessica Ennis-Hill will ask Sheffield United to remove her name from one of its stands if the club re-signs Evans. 

Jessica Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to be removed from the stand if Evans is re-signed

Mrs Ennis-Hill said she would ask for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane if Evans is given a new contract with the League One club 

Laura Kuenssberg (LK): As the leader of football in this country, should Ched Evans, who was convicted of rape, be able to play for Sheffield United again?

Greg Dyke (GD): ‘I don’t want to go into that. That’s not what I’m here for. I’m quite happy to talk about this (FIFA), I don’t really want to talk about Ched Evans.

‘I think it’s far too complicated for five minutes here'. 

LK: But shouldn’t you be taking the lead?

GD: ‘Here’s the straight forward question: Are people who go to prison entitled to come out and rebuild their lives or aren’t they? Or is what they have done so bad and they are in an industry where their image is so important and that’s the dilemma. And it’s a dilemma and it’s not clear cut. But I would rather talk about this (Fifa) if you don’t mind.

LK: But it’s an important issue.

GD: No it’s not an important issue. (talks over presented) It’s not an important issue. (Pause) It’s an important issue but not in terms of what we are here to talk about.

LK: Do you think that people will accept that you just don’t have a view?

GD: What I will talk about is when you phoned me up to ask me to come on here you asked me to talk about this (Fifa) not Ched Evans.

Britain’s most high-profile sportswoman, honoured by her local team after the 2012 Olympics, said she would sever her links with the club if it hands a contract to Evans, who has been allowed to train with his former team-mates.

Mr Dyke, 67, is a former BBC Director General and well-known Manchester United fan.

His comments provoked immediate anger on social media sites with Twitter users calling the interview a ‘car crash’.

Sportsmail's Chief Sports Reporter, Matt Lawton, tweeted: 'Just seen Greg Dyke on Newsnight. How can you not be prepared to discuss Ched Evans?'    

And Matthew Whitehouse, a professional coach and football writer, tweeted: ‘For a man with a history in media he really is awful when it comes to PR.’ 

Ennis-Hill’s withdrawal of support could now be the ‘death knell’ to any attempt by the Yorkshire club to allow Evans to relaunch his playing career.

In a statement, the athlete, 28, said: ‘I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people’s lives and set a good example.

‘If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.’

Sheffield United is already facing a huge backlash from high-profile supporters, MPs, sponsors and rape charities. TV presenter Charlie Webster, 32, stepped down as a patron of the club on Tuesday.

'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club it would completely contradict these beliefs.'

Many say Evans, 25, who still protests his innocence, cannot be rehabilitated until he admits his offence. 

On Thursday night a source said it would be ‘inconceivable’ for the club to let him play after the comments by Ennis-Hill. They added: ‘It could be the death knell.’

Evans was released from prison after serving two and a half years of a five-year sentence for raping a teenager at a hotel in 2011.

Evans and Massey became engaged following the footballer's release from prison where he served half of a sentence over the rape of a teenager in Wales. Their outing came as patrons of the club resigned
