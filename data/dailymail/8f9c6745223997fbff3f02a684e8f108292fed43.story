Alan Pardew has a knack with strikers.

It is widely regarded as the hardest part of the game – getting the ball over that painted white line between the goalposts and into the back of the net.

It is why forwards are the most sought-after, expensive and adored assets in the game.

But Pardew has a history of getting those who have recently signed for him ticking, and Yaya Sanogo was yet another example of that when he controlled a pass from Wilfried Zaha and finished over Southampton goalkeeper Fraster Forster  in Crystal Palace's FA Cup fourth-round win.

Arsene Wenger had not managed to draw a league goal from the player in his 18 months in north London, in 11 appearances.

After signing Sanogo on loan Pardew insisted that it was not necessarily goals that make a striker and that he can offer the 'chaos factor.' But Sanogo grabbed the No 9 shirt and was determined to prove what Wenger claims to have seen in him. In only his second match, he was off the mark.

At Newcastle, Pardew had a similar effect on his new recruits.

Papiss Cisse scored on his debut against Aston Villa after his £9million move from Freiburg in January of 2012. Then netted against Wolves two games later. By the end of the campaign he had played 14 games and scored 13 goals.

Demba Ba netted 17 in his first season at Newcastle following a move on a free from West Ham – and he was supposed to have knees made of glass.

When Pardew took over at Southampton in 2009 for his brief spell in charge he made Rickie Lambert one of his first signings. The £1m man from Bristol Rovers scored on his debut versus Leyton Orient, had three in his first three and an astounding 37 goals in 59 appearances that year.

Not that he is a new recruit, but Marouane Chamakh had two by half-time as Palace went 3-2 up against Southampton his first appearance in six weeks and first under Pardew.

As the half-time whistle blew, the travelling Palace supporters were singing their manager's name: 'Super, super Al, super, super Al, super, super Al, super Alan Pardew.' By the final whistle, it was even louder.

Sanogo could've had more, too. His low shot which Forster fumbled led to Chamakh's first and he headed narrowly over the bar from a corner.

Arsene Wenger has compared him to Nicolas Anelka. 'Up front it's an instinctive job,' he said. 'Experience helps a little bit. But the belief, the confidence, is more important up front than the experience.

'When I started to play Anelka, everybody said: “Why do you start Anelka, why not buy a striker?” We won a championship with him. It's just like that, if we feel they are ready then they play.;

He was bought from Paris Saint-Germain for £500,000 and sold on to Real Madrid for £23m after two years.

Sanogo has shown nothing to back that up at Arsenal, but he has not had the Pardew effect – until now.
