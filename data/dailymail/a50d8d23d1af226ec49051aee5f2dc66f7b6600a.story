'Occultists': Teacher Jake Baynes, 40, was due to stand for UKIP in next year's General Election, but has stood down amid a row with fellow members

A UKIP parliamentary candidate has resigned amid claims the party has been infiltrated by ‘occultists’.

Teacher Jake Baynes, 40, was due to stand in next year’s General Election, but he has now stood down amid a row over a ‘continuous campaign’ to oust him as the candidate.

His allies have pointed the finger at two ‘oddball’ fellow UKIP members who run an ‘angelic healing group’ in the Somerset town of Glastonbury.

They say the pair are responsible for stirring up trouble at the local party branch in Wells.

The members in question, Glen and Colleen Tucker, practise ‘alternative healing’, and work, according to their website, ‘hand in hand with the Angelic Realms, Ascended Master collective and Galactic Beings.’

They have been described as ‘oddballs’ belonging to ‘the Glastonbury occult crowd’ by one of Mr Baynes’s allies.

Graham Livings, who has also resigned from his post as branch manager, said of the Tuckers: ‘They put on these weekend retreats where they guarantee the angels will be present.

‘They are oddballs.

‘The public can be very wary of that sort of thing.

‘UKIP has a prescribed list which states that no one who has been a member of the BNP or the English Defence League should be a member.

‘But when they sat down and wrote out the prescribed list, they wouldn’t have thought to put occultists down.

Mr Baynes won 1,711 votes in 2010, and may have helped Liberal Democrat Tessa Hunt win the seat, which she took with a majority of just 800 over Conservative David Heathcoat-Amory.

He was re-selected as UKIP’s Wells candidate in April.

But soon afterwards he claims he became the victim of a vendetta by Glen and Colleen Tucker.

The Tuckers say Mr Baynes is simply ‘not up to the job’ - though they deny having any vendetta against his leadership.

In return, his supporters say the Tuckers of being just the kind of ‘fruitcakes and loonies’ which have dogged Ukip in its attempts to be seen as a serious party.

Resigning on Tuesday evening, Mr Baynes explained: ‘There has been a continuous campaign by people who, for some reason didn’t want me selected, to work their very hardest to oust me.’

He continued: ‘It’s got so bad that I really want to get out of it - I don’t want to get involved in politics again.

‘I’ve realised politics is a very ugly, dirty business, and I want nothing more to do with it.’

Referring to the owners of the Angelic Guidance and Healing Centre in Glastonbury, a town said to have ‘mystic’ properties, he said: ‘Glastonbury has many different quirky things about it, and that’s what makes it unique and I love that.

‘But I don’t think it has a place in politics, especially when you are in conversation with the Archangel.

‘I don’t think I have experienced any of their [the Tucker’s] angelic healing in my career and the campaign they have against me.’

Mr Baynes has also claimed UKIP want the Conservatives to win the seat, which is currently held by the Liberal Democrats.

Glenn and Colleen Tucker, who run the Angelic Guidance and Healing Centre, in Glastonbury, describe their business as a ‘form of energy healing’.

They said in a statement: ‘There’s no plot against Jake Baynes’, adding that he was simply not ‘up to the job’.

Mr Tucker stood unsuccessfully as a UKIP candidate in the county council elections a couple of years ago, while Mrs Tucker is currently the UKIP Somerset treasurer.

Mr Tucker said of Mr Livings: ‘He accused us of being part of the occult, which is ridiculous.

‘What we do here has nothing to do with our involvement in UKIP. We’re stalwarts of the community in Glastonbury.’

He added: ‘He is confused, if he thinks it is an occult he really doesn’t understand what we do. We are spiritual people.

‘It is like he is trying to demonise us and scare people. It is absolute trash what he said about following the Archangel Michael’s every word.’

Mrs Tucker added: ‘It is wonderful news that they have resigned but I feel a little bit ridiculous about it all.’

A spokesman for UKIP said Mr Bayne’s claim that the party wanted a Tory victory was ‘absolute nonsense’.

He added: ‘It is a Lib Dem seat which we will be fighting as hard as we can.’
