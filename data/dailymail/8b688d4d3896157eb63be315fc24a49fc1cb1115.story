Mohammed Suleman Khan built a house the size of Buckingham Palace by dodging taxes but has now been jailed

A fraudster who cheated British taxpayers out of £450,000 built a mansion the size of  Buckingham Palace in Pakistan, complete with a library and private cinema.

Mohammed Suleman Khan, 42, aroused suspicion among his neighbours as he lived in a large gated house and drove a flashy BMW, yet hung around in tracksuits and appeared to be unemployed.

When detectives raided his £500,000 home in Birmingham they were astonished to learn that this was far from the full extent of his dishonestly acquired wealth.

It emerged that he had also secretly built the ‘enormous’ £2.3million mansion in northern Pakistan, when police came across the architect’s plans. Khan was jailed for four years last week after pleading guilty to defrauding the British tax authorities out of nearly £450,000 over nine years.

Police struggled to create a detailed picture of his finances, as he was careful to use cash wherever possible and possessed few assets.

Relatives owned his family home in the Moseley area of Birmingham, and only small amounts of money passed through his bank accounts.

He claimed that he earned no more than £40,000 a year from a job as a debt collector, and other business interests.

But detectives found no evidence that he was a legitimate debt collector, and calculated his income must have been at least £1million over the nine-year period to fund his lavish lifestyle in the UK alone.

They also discovered he had handled huge amounts of bank notes – as much as £120,000 on one occasion – and had paid for expensive cars in cash, spending £22,000 on a black BMW.

The true scale of Khan’s fraud emerged when police found the plans for his luxury ‘palace’ on the outskirts of Ghorghushti, a town in northern Pakistan with strong links to Birmingham..

As the British police had no jurisdiction to investigate in Pakistan, they were forced to use satellite photographs from Google Earth to estimate its value.

Experts put the full cost of construction at £2.3million, although detectives were never able to see inside the mansion, described as ‘the size of Buckingham Palace’.

The investigation found Khan had pocketed £1.19million over nine years, and failed to pay HM Revenue and Customs more than £445,000 in tax and National Insurance.

He pleaded guilty to cheating the public revenue in November, and last week was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court.

Passing sentence, Judge Andrew Menary QC pointed to the mansion in Pakistan as the most obvious evidence that Khan was living beyond legitimate means.

He said: ‘It is enormous ... with dozens of rooms, a library, servant quarter, cinema, underground parking and guard rooms. It is the size of Buckingham Palace.’

West Midlands Police said Khan was seen as ‘untouchable’ by some members of his community, but had been brought to justice thanks to its officers’ painstaking work.

Detective Inspector Andy Bannister added: ‘The nature of Khan’s offending meant that this was a particularly complex investigation in which detectives had to piece together information from a range of sources – including satellite imaging data on the property – to secure charges.

'Khan’s bank accounts bore no resemblance to his day-to-day-living.

‘He maintained he was a debt collector and businessman but failed to provide investigators or the court with any evidence to back this up.’
