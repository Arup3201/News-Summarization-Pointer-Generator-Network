A Texas man who has come to be known as the 'vampire vet' after allegedly being caught keeping family pets alive that were meant to be euthanized was indicted on three criminal charges Wednesday.

Millard Lucien 'Lou' Tierce, 71, has been charged with one count of theft, one count of misapplication of fiduciary property and one count of animal cruelty, a Tarrant County grand jury decided, according to NBC 5.

He is facing up to five years in prison after surrendering himself in May.

At the time, officials inspecting Tierce's popular Camp Bowie Animal Clinic found that pets the veterinarian had accepted to be put down were actually being kept alive.

Indicted: Millard Lucien 'Lou' Tierce, 71, has been charged with one count of theft, one count of misapplication of fiduciary property and one count of animal cruelty after allegedly keeping dogs alive that were meant to be euthanized

Mistreated: Sid was dropped off at Tierce's clinic last year to be put down, after his owners were told Sid suffered a spinal ailment that he would not recover from. However the dog was allegedly kept in a cage for six months and used for bloody transfusions

Scene: ierce's popular Camp Bowie Animal Clinic in Fort Worth allegedly accepted animals to be put down that were actually being kept alive.

One, it was alleged, had been kept in a cage for two or three years and used for blood transfusions.

Aledo couple Jaime and Marian Harris said Tierce had agreed to euthanize their dog Sid after diagnosing him with a spinal disorder.

They were told the five-year-old the dog would not recover and Tierce offered to bury him on his farm.

However, several months later they received a call from a woman claiming to work at the clinic, telling them that Sid was alive and being used for blood transfusions.

The pair went to the clinic and found Sid in a cage.

A separate examination reveal he had no issues with his spine, but was now seriously injured after living for so long in a cage.

He has now had to undergo physiotherapy to learn how to walk properly.

A subsequent investigation revealed Tierce allegedly had three other dogs he was keeping.

One of them was his own pet.

The dog, a black and white border collie, was discovered twitching in pain inside a box left in an exam room.

One of the animal’s legs was missing, another was dislocated, and the collie also had two dislocated shoulders.

Veterinary technician Cynthia Welch told police earlier this year that Tierce's pet dog had been lying in the same position on the floor since at least June 2, 2013, when she came to work at the clinic.

Tierce told investigators that two of the pooches had been brought to the clinic by their owners to be put to sleep, but according to state records, the 71-year-old doctor believed that the decision was his to make.

Relieved: Marian Harris rescued Sid from the animal clinic after being tipped off that her dog was not put down six months earlier. Sid's rescue then lead to Tierce turning himself into police

The border collie was later put to sleep by another veterinarian, who examined her and concluded that the animal was emaciated, had severe mouth disease, cataracts, and degenerative neurological disorder, among other ailments.

A lab technician also told investigators that several animals were kept in cages for nearly 24 hours a day so experiments could be performed on them.

Tierce had received his veterinary license in 1966, and until this week, he had a spotless record. The Texas State Board of Veterinary Medical Examiners is expected to convene in Austin for an emergency meeting to discuss Tierce's fate in the medical profession.

His license suspension order stated that Tierce repeatedly violated the Veterinary Licensing Act and is a ‘continuing threat and real danger’ to the health of his patients and to the public. 

At a hearing last week, the state board formally suspended Tierce's license for an additional five years.

No court date has been set.
