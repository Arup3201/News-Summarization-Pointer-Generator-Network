The lion may be king of the jungle, but this herd of buffalo certainly showed him who's boss.

The hunter became the hunted and this scaredy-cat was forced to run for cover when buffalo he was stalking turned round and struck back.

He was forced to swallow his pride and sprint away into the bush of the Kruger National Park, South Africa, after finding himself outnumbered by the massive bovines .

escape with his life after he misjudged his attack on a herd of Cape 
buffalo in the Kruger National Park, 
South Africa, and they came sprinting after him with deadly force

African Cape buffalo can weigh up to a
ton and have powerful fused horns so strong that they have sometimes 
even been known to stop rifle bullets.

Their herds are remarkable for their lack of hierarchy and an apparent altruism that makes them fiercely protective of calves and weaker members.

When chased by predators the herd sticks close together, calves gathered in the middle, to make it hard for any one member to be picked off.

They fight off threats, as in this instance, by forming a mob and charging at predators with superior weight and numbers.

Buffalo have been recorded chasing lions up a tree and keeping them there for as long as two hours.

Lion cubs unlucky enough to get in the way can get trampled and killed.

This not so cunning cat was lucky 
enough to make his escape with his tail between his legs after the 
tables turned when he tried to pounce on this herd.

Photographer, Dave Woollacott, captured the fear etched on the lions face as he frantically tried to escape the furious buffalo.

Mr Woollacott, a project manager from Johannesburg, was travelling with his wife, celebrating their 33rd wedding anniversary, when he spotted the extraordinary scene.

'It was dusk and the sky was heavy with cloud when we started to leave the park through the Phabeni Gate,' he said.

'Suddenly we came across a herd of Cape buffalo in a dry river bed.

'We watched as lion tried to attack from the left bank.

'But the buffalo outnumbered him and they chased the frightened lion away, across the river bed and into the undergrowth.'
