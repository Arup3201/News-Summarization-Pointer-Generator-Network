Beyonce’s father approached Sony with plans to make a film about the early life of his daughter and her group Destiny’s Child according to the latest emails leaked from Sony.

Matthew Knowles, who managed his daughter’s career until she sacked him in 2011, is also believed to have approached Universal according to the email dated December 4, 2013.

‘Matthew Knowles, Beyonce’s Father wants to make the film of Destiny’s Child and came to me first,’ wrote Screen Gems president Clint Culpepper to Sony’s Amy Pascal and a few other Sony executives.

Beyonce’s father Matthew Knowles had approached Sony with plans to make a film about the early life of his daughter and her group Destiny’s Child according to the latest emails leaked from Sony

‘He’s going to Universal next. Do we think it would be a successful film? They’re on Sony label. I’m just not sure that it’s not too soon.’

The Lifetime Network is set to air a Destiny’s Child biopic in February, but the Sony executives return very enthusiastic responses to Culpepper, reports The Daily Beast.

Knowles had guided his daughter’s career since her teenage debut as lead singer of Destiny’s Child, but she took over the reins of her own career in 2011 amid allegations that he had stolen money from her.

Between 1998 and 2005 the band enjoyed a run of hit singles including Independent Women, Bootylicious and Say My Name despite several lineup changes. They split in 2005 as Beyonce decided to focus on her solo career.

In recent years Knowles has become better known for fathering several illegitimate children rather than his business prowess.

Another musician mentioned in the latest leaked emails is Kanye West and discusses about potential pitch for a feature film featuring the rapper.

West is reportedly set to appear in the as-yet-untitled Christmas Eve film due out next year starring Seth Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

In an email dated August 7, 2014, producer James Weaver wrote: ‘We’ll have an XMAS tease for 2015. We have a specific idea to attach to THE INTERVIEW that will crush.

The latest leaks also reveal that Sony is looking into rebooting its Spiderman franchise yet again.

Sony has plans for a Spider-Man three cameo in the third Captain America film, Captain America: Civil War, which is scheduled to be released in May 2016.

Other emails include discusses about plans for a 'female spidey movie,' and an Avengers-like superhero extravaganza incorporating characters from different upcoming Spider-Man-related projects.  

The Guardians of Peace group, which has disclosed financial information and embarrassing private correspondence from the highest echelons of the entertainment giant, heralded the seventh 'gift' in a message on a file-sharing site.

The hackers wrote: 'We are preparing for you a Christmas gift. The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting.

'The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state.'

According to technology site Re/code, the new information will deal with a 2006 acquisition of a video site called Grouper, later renamed Crackle.

Sony has been battered by the disclosures, which include racist emails mocking President Obama, and insults directed at Will Smith's children.

Most of the exchanges involve Sony Pictures chairman Amy Pascal, who is now said to be fighting to keep her high-powered job.

Other disclosures included accusations that Leonardo DiCaprio is 'despicable' for pulling out of a film, and a description of Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'.

Further disclosures have centered on the upcoming release of The Interview, a film depicting the assassination of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

Exchanges reveal pressure was applied to director and star Seth Rogen to change the death scene.

Some have claimed that the hackers are linked to the North Korean regime.

Another repercussion of the hack has been the alleged collapse of Sony's financial systems. 

According to reports Friday, the company is now unable to process transactions, which has led to external companies canceling film shoots.
