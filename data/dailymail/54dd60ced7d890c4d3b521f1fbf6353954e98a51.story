A kindhearted mother whose daughter died at just six months has set up a charity which provides parents with free photos of their premature babies in hospital.

Capturing Hopes Photography founder Deneen Bryan and a team of volunteer professional snappers capture a preemie’s growth as a gift to families too distressed or unable to take photos.

Bryan, a mother-of-six from North Carolina, said the work is emotionally difficult but rewarding.

One baby she has photographed is tiny Walker Pruett who weighed just 1lb 3oz when he was born prematurely on April 25.

Walker Pruett

Adorable: Walker Pruett was born severely premature on April 25,  weighing just one pound and three ounces

Pulling through: On day 5, Walker's parents were able to hold him for the first time. He couldn't breathe on his own

Fast forward: By day 27, Walker has grown a little and is looking healthier

Bryan's team created a time-lapse video charting Walker's progress for its new 'Project 100 Days'.

The project aims to show a preemie's growth in the first 100 days of its life at the hospital.

For Walker's parents, Erica and Jared Pruett, it was a dream come true.

Bryan's beautiful photos show Walker from the moment he was born and put on a ventilator, to day 80 when he was healthy enough to be discharged from hospital.

'(Walker) was just so, so tiny. You couldn’t touch him. You couldn’t rub him. You just had to pat his skin, because his skin was so fragile. ... It was five days before we could hold him,' Erica told Martinsville Bulletin.

'(Bryan) was excellent to us ... She came every single day that he was in the NICU and took a picture of him. After we left the NICU, she did a photoshoot with us. She gave us the complete rights to all those pictures.'

New life: On day 74, Walker weighed four pounds

Healthy: Eighty days after birth, Walker was healthy enough to go home

Bryan, who set up the charity last year, said she was inspired by a volunteer photographer who provided her with free pictures of her daughter's hospital stay.

Bryan's six-month-old daughter died at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota in 1998.

'After
 she passed away, we got the photos in the mail,' Bryan told The Blaze. 'That’s 
when I really realized how important those photos were. That was our 
only professional photo that we had of our family at the time.'

When the little girl died, the Bryans moved to Ireland, returning to the US in 2008.

Bryan, a professional photographer, began taking free photos for Ronald McDonald families and their children. There were waiting lists for her popular service.

The Mid West native began taking photos of preemies when she noticed that they were an under served
 segment of patients.

'They didn’t have anyone coming in. The baby was only one to two pounds and mom and dad didn’t have any photos except cellphone shots,' Bryan said.

Kindhearted: Mother-of-six Deneen Bryan has set up charity 'Capturing Hopes' and photographs premature babies in hospital as a free gift for their parents

Bryan
 said she and her volunteer photographers have learned how to work with families to get good shots.

'The
 parents were dressed up, makeup and hair done. It was 
giving the families something to look forward to every two weeks,' she said.

'You
 have to say things like ‘Wow, he’s got really long fingers. I bet he’s 
going to play basketball someday. Or ‘Look at that hair; she’s going to 
have beautiful hair'.'

The photographers are prepared for anything.

'A baby could code right there while you’re 
there. … [You] have to be professional but compassionate. They need you 
to be together,' Bryan said.

'I
 have had a couple of volunteers where you could see a tear and they 
just kind of turned to wipe it away. It really affects volunteers the 
first time they’re in.'
