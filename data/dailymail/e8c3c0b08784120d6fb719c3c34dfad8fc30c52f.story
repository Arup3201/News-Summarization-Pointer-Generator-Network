Dougie Freedman is set to stay as Bolton manager despite the club's disastrous start to the season.

Wanderers lost their sixth match out of nine this season on Saturday, 2-0 to Derby, and there were fan protests, people invading the pitch and songs calling for the boss's head.

Bolton are 22nd in the Championship table and travel to second-bottom Fulham on Wednesday.

And the club have indicated Freedman will be in charge at Craven Cottage by saying he will be at the pre-match press conference.

Nobody from Bolton would comment further but the Scot told the Bolton News: 'I expect to be in charge when we go to Fulham.

'I understand I am in charge and have responsibility of a wonderful football club and I'm proud to be in charge of it. Right now we're getting it wrong. 

'It's proven to be a harder job than I first thought when I walked in.'
