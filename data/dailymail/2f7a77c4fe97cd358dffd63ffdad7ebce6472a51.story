A woman from South Carolina who lost her engagement ring six and a half years ago was shocked to be reunited with it after the jewellery was found in a friend's car.

Leslie Tiller, from Richmond, misplaced the diamond ring in 2007 a month before her wedding and never thought she'd see it again.

But as she opened her festive presents last week, there was a special surprise from her husband, Adam - the ring.

Mrs Tiller misplaced the diamond ring in 2007 a month before her wedding. Her husband surprised her by presenting it to her this Christmas

On the Friday before Christmas, Jacob Hickman, a college friend of her husband Adam, noticed the jewellery in the cup holder of his car after collecting it from the Midas Auto Service Shop in nearby Greenville

As she exclaimed: 'What?', Mr Tiller replied: 'That's our ring, baby.'

On the Friday before Christmas, Jacob Hickman noticed some jewellery in the cup holder of his car after collecting it from a garage where it had just been serviced.

'I could not understand or think about why on this earth would there be a diamond ring in my car,'Â  Hickman, of nearby Greenville, told Fox Carolina.

Brandon Estell, the mechanic who worked on Jacob Hickman's Honda hybrid, discovered the ring after removing one of the back seats to carry out some maintenance

He said: 'I'm glad that I could help these guys out and make their Christmas a little more special than usual.'

In 2007, Hickman and his wife had driven his college friend, Adam Tiller, and his then fiancee home from a wedding in Richmond.

During the journey, Leslie took the ring off to clean it, dropped it, and assumed it had landed in her lap.

She only realised it was missing after a fruitless search once she got home.

Four weeks later, the Tillers got married, using a replacement ring.

Mrs Tiller said: 'This is by far the most magical Christmas I've ever had. I never thought I'd see that ring again.'
