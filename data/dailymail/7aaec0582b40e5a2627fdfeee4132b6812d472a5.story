James McArthur caused backlash on Twitter after he complained about getting a parking fine

A Premier League footballer who earns £40,000-a-week has riled fans after he took to Twitter to moan about a £38 parking fine. 

James McArthur, central midfielder at Crystal Palace, had taken a trip to a Costa coffee shop in central London when he returned to his car to find a penalty charge notice on the windscreen.

He snapped a picture of the yellow ticket and posted it on Twitter, via social networking site Sportlobster, with the comment: 'Coffee cost me 39 pound. #nothappy.'

But the 27-year-old Scot, who signed from Wigan for £7million last summer, got little sympathy on social media as fans mocked his tight-fistedness.

Frankie Humphries told him: 'Sure 38 quid won't be denting your bank balance terribly,' and James Kearney said: 'That's at least five minutes wages! Unlucky pal.'

One fan, Craig Wilson, sarcastically commented: 'Bet you're skint now,' while a Wigan fan quipped he should have stayed in the north-west to use the free parking outside the side's stadium.

Another user, named Alan, joked: 'Take the boy out of Glasgow but can't take Glasgow out the boy!!'

The midfielder, who landed a three-year contract with the club in September, has only played for the side seven times so far.

He started his career at Hamilton before joining Wigan - where he established himself in the first team and played in the famous FA Cup final success over Manchester City in 2013.

McArthur, who has a wife - Louisa - and a daughter Ella-Rose, often posts on social media about visiting coffee shops.

In September he tweeted a picture of a Starbucks coffee cup with the name 'Jims' written on the side, and joked: 'This is what I sound like to a southerner'.

Later that month he posted another picture of himself with his baby daughter after telling fans they were enjoying some 'daddy and daughter time' and 'two coffees will do it'. 

The tweet, which the 27-year-old Crystal Palace player posted on Twitter, caused outrage from fans

Jamie O'Hara has also caused outrage on Twitter

Multi-millionaire footballer Jamie O'Hara sparked a Twitter fury in 2012 after he wrote on the social networking site about his hard life as a professional footballer.

The Wolverhampton Wanderers player - who is thought to be paid about £35,000 a week - posted a tweet where he appeared to bemoan his life situation, longing for 'easier' days on £100 a week.

The 26-year-old wrote: ‘Things were so much easier when I earned 100pound a week on wts #stress’.

The tweet referred to his days on the Youth Training Scheme, and it did not take long before his followers' angry reactions came flooding in.

And after an angry backlash from followers, he caused even more fury by hitting back with: ‘Why do people think cos I earn good money I don't have bills to pay we all pay tax an we have mortgages to pay, some people are deluded.’

Dozens of people bombarded Twitter with mocking tweets, accusing the footballer of being out of touch with the lives of ordinary people.
