Fined: Shane Defoe, arriving at court today charged with possessing drugs and a lock-knife

The step-brother of England ace Jermain Defoe escaped with a fine today after he was caught with cannabis and a lock-knife.

Shane Defoe was a passenger in a car when police pulled him over in Bishopsgate, central London, on April 22, last year.

After searching him, officers found a small quantity of cannabis and took the jobless 25-year-old to a police station to be strip-searched, City of London Magistrates' Court heard.

A six-inch knife, which had been hidden in the waistband of his boxer shorts, fell to the ground as he was being ordered to undress.

Maha Sardar, a privately-instructed defence barrister, said Defoe had previously given up smoking cannabis following another conviction a year ago.

'But after his father became ill with cancer - as is widely known - he would smoke cannabis to relieve the stress,' she said.

'It was a small amount of cannabis and it was for personal use.'

She added he had been handed the knife by another passenger in the car just seconds before it was stopped.

'This article was not in use to threaten or cause fear in any way,' she said.

Fining him £225 along with an order to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge, chair of the bench Spyro Elia told him: 'We are going to deal with this by fines.

'Bladed articles are very, very serious offences.

Tragic: Jade Defoe, who was known by his middle name Gavin, died following a street attack in 2009

'This may be your first time, which is why you've got away with a fine. But if it ever happens again you're not going to give whatever court you come up in front of much option '

The penalties will be deducted from his employment support allowance at a rate of £10 per week.

Defoe, who claimed in the dock he had only £10 cash with him, said he could not afford to pay the full balance immediately but agreed to make an initial payment of £5 before leaving the building.

Defoe, of, Leytonstone, east London, admitted possessing a bladed article in a public place and possession of class B drugs.

Dad Jimmy Defoe, 47, lost his battle with throat cancer earlier this month prompting Jermain to fly back from Poland to be with his family.

The Tottenham frontman then returned to be with the England squad in time for their first game against France.

In 2009 another sibling, Jade, was killed following a street attack in Leytonstone when his skull was fractured and suffered devastating brain damage.
