It is the driest desert in the world, with some weather stations there having never recorded any rainfall.

But the Atacama Desert in northern Chile may come to life as researchers use water collected from fog to grow plants in the previously desolate area.

Photographer Neil Hall captured images of locals at the village of Chanaral who use huge specially designed nets to gather water from vaporised droplets in the air.

The Atacama desert is the driest place in the world, with some weather stations in the area having never recorded any rain fall

The striking photographs show a process that may help reverse the desertification of the area.

Scientists at the Alto Patache research centre, run by the Universidad Catolica have shown that water spilt during the collection of fog water has led to a variety of plantlife growing in the desert.

The garden grew from seeds hidden in the desert for many years. Later experiments showed that by using fog water the desert could be transformed and turned into large scale farms and gardens.

The Atacama Desert, spanning from Chile to Peru, is considered the driest place on Earth. It is so arid that even mountains reaching as high as 22,589 ft are completely free of glaciers

Although there is no water on the ground, moisture in the air from a heavy coastal fog passes through the net and condenses before travelling through pipes into tanks where it is stored.

The fog collectors are huge nets hung between two poles and are made of a polypropylene mesh that captures the droplets.

When the droplets gather together they then run into the storage tanks.

The water is pure for drinking and can be used for agriculture, with a collective in the village of Chanaral use the water for small-scale aloe vera farming. 

However, if the process was used on a larger scale the possibility to change the hostile desert environment is great. 

The water is pure enough to drink and can also be used for agriculture, helping to boost the local economy

The fog water condenses on the nets and is collected in large containers. With more investment the water could help revitalise the area

The plants grown from water spilled during the process shows that there are a wide variety of seeds in the ground. Fog water has been used to transform once arid patches of desert into gardens.

Currently water is piped to towns from hundreds of miles away in the Andes or driven by water trucks, so fog collection could prove to be a sustainable way to revitalise the area.

Non-profit organisation FogQuest, who make collection nets, say that each cubic meter of fog contains 0.05 to 0.5 grams of water.

FogQuest projects have been established in Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Cape Verde Islands, Eritrea, South Africa, Yemen, Oman, Ethiopia, Israel, and Nepal.
