It's a mother's job to make sure her children learn how to fend for themselves.

And it's no different on the African plains as incredible new images have captured the moment a lioness teaches her cubs how to kill a wildebeest.

At first the young cats seem nervous and reluctant to take down the animal in order to eat.

The images show a reluctant and nervous looking lion cub being taught to hunt wildebeest by his mother on the African plain in Kenya 

Even though her cubs look nervous, the mother is insistent that they must learn to hunt and tries to grab the attention of the wildebeest 

After grabbing the animal's attention, it is then down to the two young cubs to take over as they begin to chase the defenceless animal 

But the devoted mother is insistent that her cubs must learn how to hunt and approaches the prey to grab its attention.

As she walks away, her two cubs then attack the defenceless wildebeest from behind.

Initially, the horned animal manages to keep the three predators at bay, but after a couple of minutes the wildebeest is overpowered and the cubs catch their first prey.

The amazing images were captured by photographer Mark Dumbleton in Kenya's Masai Mara National Park.

At first the wildebeest appears to be holding its own and looks as though he might escape from the clutches of the lioness and her young 

But he eventually becomes overpowered by the three big cats who jump on his back and attempted to drag the wildebeest to the ground 

The stunning pictures taken in Kenya were snapped by photographer Mark Dumbleton, who said the whole experience just lasted minutes 

Mr Dumbleton from Johannesburg, South Africa said: 'It was amazing to watch a mother training her children for when they have to leave the pride.

'I couldn't believe the animal instinct they had.

'The lioness was roaring at them, but they knew exactly how to take down such a large animal.

'The whole experience only lasted a couple of minutes.

'As soon as the wildebeest was separated from the herd, it was easy for the lions to take it down.'

Mr Dumbleton has only been taking pictures since 2007, but now travels around Africa snapping the landscape and wildlife.

Mr Dumbleton said: 'I couldn't believe the animal instinct they had. The lioness was roaring at them, but they knew exactly how to take down such a large animal.

The lions finally get their prey and the wildebeest is dragged to the floor after being given a lesson in hunting by the lioness 

He added: 'The awe-inspiring wilderness of Africa is motivating, it's captured my attention.

'It's really inspiring and as the saying goes, Africa truly runs through my blood.

'I photograph nature in its purest form because I love it, and I love to share my work with people who appreciate it.'
