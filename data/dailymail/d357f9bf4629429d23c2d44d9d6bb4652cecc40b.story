Arsenal's midfield was in disarray in defeat to Monaco on Wednesday night, leaving Sky Sports pundit Jamie Redknapp claiming they 'couldn't tackle a hot dinner' and should sign Geoffrey Kondogbia.

Arsenal were completely out-gunned in midfield as Monaco cantered away from the Emirates with a 3-1 win in the Champions League last 16 first-leg as Kondogbia, former Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov and substitute Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco completed a nightmare evening for the hosts.

Redknapp and fellow pundit Graeme Souness were scathing of Arsenal's lack of organisation and presence in the middle of the park in particular.

'Arsenal were off the cuff. I didn’t think Coquelin was too bad but he was taken off as he was booked so Arsenal were left with Cazorla, a wonderfully gifted attacking player, Rosicky, and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain,' Redknapp said in the Sky studio.

'That midfield couldn’t tackle a hot dinner! Kondogbia was incredible for Monaco, he was exactly the player Arsenal needed to sign.’

Souness added to the criticism of the dismal Arsenal perfromance: 'They were so, so disorganised. Arsene Wenger keeps trying to create ultimate football, they have all these creative players that want to go forward but all successful teams have contrasting types of players, people who can break up the play and ease up the pressure,' added Souness.

'I’ve said it many times before that Arsenal are too easy to play against, an average European team has blown them away tonight.'

Arsenal will need at least three goals in Monaco during the second-leg on March 17 but crucially they will need much more pace, penetration and determination to progress:

'It’s the first time I’ve not enjoyed a night at the Emirates watching Arsenal. There is nothing about tonight Arsenal can be happy with,' blasted Souness.

Redknapp left one last damming assessment of Arsenal's performance, which he believes will fuel the critics of Wenger's recent reign: ‘Everything bad from Arsenal in the past five or six seasons we saw tonight.’
