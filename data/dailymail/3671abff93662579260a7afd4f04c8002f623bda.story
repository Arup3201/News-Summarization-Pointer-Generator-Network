As Britain's first female Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was not only pioneering in politics but also in fashion, setting an example of how she believed women in power should dress.

During her time as PM in the Eighties, she became famous for her power dressing suits, pussybow blouses and, of course, her treasured pearls.

The Iron Lady, who died today aged 87, summed up her style as 'never flashy, just appropriate.'

Signature style: Margaret Thatcher became known for her smart suits, practical heels and pearls

The former Conservative leader spoke of her fashion choices in an interview with Dr Miriam Stoppard for Yorkshire TV in 1985, saying she did have to be conscious of her image but she was more concerned with feeling comfortable than stylish.

She said: 'What you do is decide the clothes in 
which you are comfortable. You must be comfortable. You are going to a 
great occasion. It must be a style that you are comfortable in. Must be a
 fabric that you are comfortable in, that hangs well, and you must know 
that you look appropriate for the occasion. Never flashy, just appropriate.'

She continued: 'It is not unfeminine to be well-tailored. Indeed, it often perhaps concentrates
 on what you are going to say if you have got well-tailored things on 
because people no longer look at your clothes.'

Feminine touch: She said she often wore pussybow blouses because they were 'rather softening and pretty'

Substance over style: The Baroness said she always aimed to dress appropriately

Baroness Thatcher admitted that what she wore 'became part of the job' because she was 'representing the country'.

She admitted to Dr Stoppard that she didn't always get it right.  She regretted wearing a blue and white 
striped hat in the Seventies when she was the education secretary because she realised it wasn't fitting for her role.

'It was a very smart hat. The fact was it
 would have done for an actress, but it was not quite right for a 
politician. I learned that lesson ever since. If you are going to wear a
 smart hat, wear a very plain one,' she said.

The Baroness' signature style was one that she honed during her time as PM. Growing up as the daughter of a grocer, she was used to being on her feet and helping in the shop.

Hats off: She was a fan of hats in the Sixties but lived to regret some of her choices and didn't wear them as often during her time as Prime Minister

This helped her become aware of the practicalities of fashion - comfortable shoes like her low heels were always preferable over high heels, no matter how stylish.

Her mother and father were also frugal which taught her to buy clothes and accessories that lasted - like her black Asprey handbag that would last 
for decades. It still looked as good as new when it sold at auction at 
Christie's for £25,000 in 2011.

Abi Morgan researched Baroness Thatcher's fashion when writing the script for the film The Iron Lady.

The film depicts how the Baroness was advised on how to make her image less frumpy on her bid to win power including giving up wearing hats and pearls.

She refused on the latter because they were of sentimental value - given to her by her husband Denis when their twins were born.

True blue: The former Conservative leader said her party's colour was always her favourite shade

Firm favourite: She's continued to wear the colour often for public appearances, such as when she returned to Number 10 when David Cameron came to power

Morgan said when the film was released: 'The star-makers may have told her 
what to wear but she already knew how to dress - she was of that generation of women
 trained to appear in a certain way, hair set, with a proper hat, 
gloves, bag and shoes. The grooming was very regal, and her uniform had a
 regality about it.'

Morgan's belief that the former Prime Minster 'knew how to dress' is backed up by  Marianne Abrahams, the design director of one of the politician's favourite labels, Aquascutum.

'She knows precisely what she wants and she's particular about the fit of the shoulders,' she said of designing some of her bespoke suits in the Eighties.

Wardrobe staple: Her penchant for pearls endured over the decades

While the Baroness knew what she wore in the male dominated world of politics would help her to be taken seriously, she also did not want to lose her femininity.

'You do not lose your feminine qualities just because you are a Prime Minister,' she said.

This is why she loved her pussybow blouse so much. 'I often wear bows; they are rather softening, they are rather pretty,' she said.

When it came to the colour of her clothes, she was always keen to tow the party line - maintaining that her favourite shade was always 'my party's colour' sapphire blue.

Lasting appeal: A selection of her outfits were auctioned off at Christies in 2012

She often chose to wear this colour for public appearances long after she was voted out of power.

Her fashion choices were often replicated in the Eighties and thanks to the release of The Iron Lady film, other elements of her style have revived in popularity including the Peter Pan collar and midi length skirt.

Many people have championed her style over the years including handbag entrepreneur Anya Hindmarch who once told Vogue, 'I am a 
lifelong fan of Margaret Thatcher.'

She said: 'Margaret Thatcher dressed as a strong
 woman and developed a style that was very much her own brand. The hair,
 the bow, the pearls and the handbag all became iconic.'
