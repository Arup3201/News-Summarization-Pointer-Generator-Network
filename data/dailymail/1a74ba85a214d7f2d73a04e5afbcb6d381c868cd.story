Gareth Bale has heaped praise upon Real Madrid's 'amazing' attacking options following a record-breaking 2014 for the club.

The Welsh superstar scored in the finals as Real won the Copa del Rey, Champions League and Club World Cup, as well as playing an integral role as Carlo Ancelotti's side ended the year with a 22-game winning run.

'It's an amazing line-up that we have. The three of us enjoying playing together up front,' Bale told AS. 'I think we work really well and we showed that by winning all the trophies.'
