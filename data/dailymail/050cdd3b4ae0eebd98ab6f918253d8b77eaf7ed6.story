Now seven months pregnant, the Duchess of Cambridge might have expected all eyes to be on her sizeable bump.

But windy weather and her flimsy outfit had other ideas. Kate was left red-faced after the gusts lifted up her £38 polka-dot dress, drawing attention instead to her thighs.

The royal mother-to-be was caught out by the wind as she arrived at the wedding of friends Willian van Cutsem and Rosie Ruck Keene, in south Oxfordshire, just over a week ago.

Whoops: A seven months pregnant Duchess of Cambridge was hit by an unfortunate gust of wind which blew up her skirt and exposed her thighs

Seemingly unaware that her skirt had blown up, revealing her shapely legs, she gripped her black and white fascinator rather than her hem, laughing as she did so.

It happened as she walked towards St Mary the Virgin Church, in the village of Ewelme in the Chiltern Hills, on Saturday, May 11.

The duchess appeared not to have learned her lesson from the last time she wore the Topshop dress, when she suffered a similar wardrobe malfunction.

Having fun: The royal couple arrived separately at St Mary the Virgin Church, in the village of Ewelme in the Chiltern Hills

She was forced to hold down the back 
of the black and cream outfit as she arrived at the Hertfordshire-based 
Warner Bros Studios with Princes William and Harry, last month.

The High Street bargain sold out 
within hours of her wearing it, but the dress may not get a third 
showing after proving unsuitable for the gusty British weather once 
again.

Kate attended the 
wedding with Prince William, who arrived separately and was believed to 
have been an usher, wearing the same morning suit, blue striped shirt, 
and dark red tie as the groom.

Gusty: The wind in Oxfordshire first showed the Duchess's growing bump before it lifted her flimsy dress, although Kate didn't seem too worried as she walked with a male companion

The couple have known the van Cutsem family for many years and the groom's niece, Grace, was a flower girl at the royal wedding.

Famous: Marilyn Monroe's dress blows up in the 1955 movie 'The Seven Year Itch'

Kate's embarrassing moment, reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe in film The Seven Year Itch, was one of several for the duchess.

In
July 2011, during a North American tour, her cream and navy cable-knit 
Alexander McQueen dress was whipped up by the wind as she met 
wellwishers in Charlottetown, in Canada.

On that occasion she was wearing a 
cream slip, which protected her modesty. She was not so lucky four days 
later as her yellow Jenny Packham dress flew up on the tarmac at Calgary
airport, briefly revealing her underwear.

But the duchess, who is expected to give birth on July 13, handled all the mishaps with her usual poise.

The exact due date had been shrouded 
in secrecy, but close friends of the royal couple discussed at a 
barbecue hosted by a family friend that Kate expects to go into labour 
on July 13 - during the Queen's Coronation Festival.

For
the first time, 50 per cent said Charles would be a fitting monarch in 
the YouGov poll, up 13 per cent from May last year. The Prince of Wales 
was seen as making a positive contribution to the monarchy by 60 per 
cent of voters.

The poll showed, for the first time, a majority believe the Queen should abdicate if she becomes too ill to fulfil her duties. 

Happy couple: Kate and William were at the wedding to support Willian van Cutsem and Rosie Ruck Keene

Troubles: Kate also had problems on her North American tour with William in 2011, when the wind blew up her dress twice in four day

On Saturday, Pippa Middleton made an obligatory appearance at a scoiety wedding.

But the happy couple’s choice of toast was more suited to The Only Way is Essex than its higher-class Chelsea counterpart.

Guests toasted the bride and groom with Smirnoff Ice, a vodka alcopop flavoured with lemon, and knocked back gin shots before the service, according to onlookers.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s little sister attended the wedding of Verity Evetts and Christopher Buchanan at the Church of St Peter and Holy Cross, Wherwell, Hampshire.

Showing off her famous figure in a skin-tight pale pink £370 Tory Burch Adelaide dress, she looked stylish and svelte as she posed for the cameras.

Cream delight: Pippa made an entrance wearing a 
feminine lacy dress by Tory Burch. The £370 silk dress featured a 
chiffon top with a seahorse pattern while the skirt was made from cream 
lace

Dates: The 29-year-old arrived at the Church of St Peter and Holy Cross with her date, banker Tom Kingston (left), 34, and younger brother James Middleton (right)

Shouldn't that be champagne? Verity Evetts and her husband were seen clutching Smirnoff Ice alcopops as they left the church
