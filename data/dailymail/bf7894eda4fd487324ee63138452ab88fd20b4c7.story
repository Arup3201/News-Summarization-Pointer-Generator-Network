Violent criminals, including murderers, have been using Facebook to taunt victims and their families from behind bars.

Other prisoners have been maintaining their criminal empires via the social networking site.

Inmates are banned from accessing the internet but manage to get online by using mobile phones  smuggled into jails.

Convicted killer: Liam Ryan, 19, is pictured in an image posted on Facebook making an obscene gesture in his cell at Brinsford young offender's institute. Figures show 350 prisoners have been caught accessing the social network from their cells despite a strict ban on internet access

In the last two years, nearly 350 have been discovered posting on Facebook. It is likely there are dozens of others using the site without the authorities being aware.

The official figures have raised major concerns about security failures in prisons. Last night victims’ groups said criminals using Facebook were adding ‘insult to injury’.

Attackers who taunted their victims were getting away with torture, they said, and called for tougher measures to control the problem.

Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said: ‘Offenders using Facebook from prison makes  a mockery of the idea that they are being punished. It adds insult to injury when they use it to intimidate victims and witnesses. Victim Support would like to see this more tightly controlled and monitored.’

Jean Taylor from Families Fighting for Justice said: ‘These perpetrators should not be able to have access to mobile phones in prison.

‘They are getting away with torturing their victims. The social networking sites should police this much more closely.’

The problem emerged two years ago when the Justice Secretary at the time, Jack Straw, revealed that 30 Facebook sites had been taken down after prisoners were found to be abusing their victims from behind bars.

At the time Mr Straw said the situation was ‘horrible, profoundly disturbing, and deeply offensive to public morality’. But today’s details suggest the problem is getting much worse.

Ministry of Justice figures released after a Freedom of Information request show that 143 Facebook profiles were removed between July 2009 and June 2010.

Another 199 were removed between July 2010 and June last year. All were closed by Facebook following investigations by prison officials.

There is no indication how long the pages were on the internet before they were closed.

A source close to Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke said: ‘The internet is banned for prisoners. Anyone caught using Facebook in prison will be severely disciplined.

'Ken is absolutely determined to stamp out the use of mobile phones in prisons and other illicit items such as drugs.’

Facebook posts: Colin Gunn, who is serving 35 years for conspiracy to murder, used his Facebook page to threaten people from behind bars. Convicted killer Ryan Herbert sent flirtatious messages to female friends from his Facebook account, and posted pictures of himself and other inmates in the prison gym

Two years ago it emerged that one of Britain’s most dangerous gangsters, Colin Gunn, was using Facebook to threaten his enemies from his high security prison cell.

The gang boss, who was locked up for 35 years for conspiracy to murder, was able to correspond with up to 565 ‘friends’ for more than two months until the page was shut down.

There were also fears he was able to carry on running his crime empire from behind bars.

In one posting, Gunn wrote: ‘I will be home one day and I can’t wait to look into certain people’s eyes and see the fear of me being there.

‘It’s good to have an outlet to let you know how I am, some of you will be in for a good slagging, some have let me down badly, and will be named and shamed, ****ing rats.’

The 44-year-old was jailed in 2006 over the revenge killings of John and Joan Stirland, who had fled threats in Nottingham to hide on the Lincolnshire coast. 

Last year Ryan Herbert, who murdered 20-year-old Sophie Lancaster in 2007, was found to have sent more than 100 messages using the site.

He sent flirtatious posts to female friends and uploaded pictures of himself with other inmates in the prison gym.

Recently a teenager who killed a shopkeeper posted a series of pictures on Facebook showing him making ‘gangster salutes’.

Easy to conceal: Prisoners use mobile phones equipped with internet access smuggled into jails to access Facebook and other web services

Liam Ryan, 19, was jailed for life for the murder of Suppiah Tharmaseelan in Birmingham.

The pictures, apparently taken in his cell, show Ryan making an obscene gesture.

They also show piles of junk food in his cell, and his personal television set and games console.

Prison chiefs have attempted to use technology to jam mobile phones within the walls. But they have struggled to make it work, especially in urban prisons where blocking a signal may affect nearby residents.

Prisons also use body scanners on visitors to try to prevent mobile phones getting into jails.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Prisoners have no access to the internet and are barred from updating their Facebook accounts, or asking others to do so from outside prison. If they do, their accounts will be terminated.

‘If a prisoner is found in illicit  possession of a mobile phone or other contraband they will be  dealt with appropriately by the prison.’

A Facebook spokesman said: ‘If something is happening which violates our use policy we will be very active and robust in removing it.’

'Insult': Brooke Kinsella, sister of murdered teenager Ben Kinsella, was appalled to learn one of his killers was able to operate a Facebook page from prison

One of the killers of 16-year-old Ben Kinsella used his Facebook page to taunt his victim’s family from behind bars.

Jade Braithwaite, 22, boasted that he was ‘down but not out’.

For his profile picture, he mocked up a T-shirt emblazoned with his face and the slogan ‘Free Jade Braithwaite’.

From his cell at a Buckinghamshire youth prison, he wrote of how he wanted a remote control so that he could ‘mute or delete people when I need to’.

The mocking posts were revealed six months after Braithwaite, Juress Kika and Michael Alleyne were convicted at the Old Bailey in June 2009 of murder.

Ben’s sister, Brooke, 28, a former EastEnders actress, said at the time: ‘My family and I are appalled that Jade Braithwaite is able to operate a Facebook page from inside prison – and to use the site to protest his innocence is really upsetting.

'We are disgusted by the comments on the site and feel it is a real insult to Ben’s memory.’

Ben was out in Holloway, north London, celebrating the end of his GCSEs in June 2008, when he was stabbed 11 times.

In February 2010, the then Justice Secretary Jack Straw intervened after a meeting with Margaret and Barry Mizen, whose son Jimmy was murdered in a bakery in Lee, south-east London.

Mr Mizen believed that his son’s killer Jake Fahri, 21, had been using Facebook and Twitter to post bullying and offensive comments about his son, accusing him of being a ‘pathetic loser’.

Aaron Aymer, 22, who stabbed his girlfriend’s brother to death in 2007, used a page to protest his innocence.

He posted a photograph of himself in a body-building pose.
