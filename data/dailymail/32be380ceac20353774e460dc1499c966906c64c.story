U.S. Soccer's official twitter feed had a peculiarly childish riposte to Robin van Persie when he congratulated Nani for his sudden goal in the opening minutes of USA's clash with Portugal last night.

Seconds after the strike, which picked up on a bad pass by a U.S. defender, Manchester United and Netherlands ace Van Persie tweeted: 'Yesss @luisnani great goal.'

It prompted a terse reply from U.S. Soccer which read simply: '@Persie_Official #Lame.'

Sour grapes? U.S. Soccer's curt response to Robin van Persie congratulating Nani on his goal

The curt tweet inspired thousands of responses, with many telling the Americans they were unlikely to ever enjoy World Cup success until they start calling the sport by its proper name.

In the end, however, terminology notwithstanding, it looked as if USA might overpower Portugal and book their place in the last 16.

At least it did until Cristiano Ronaldo's cross caught Varela's diving header put the teams even at 2-2 in the dying seconds.

The United States soccer team were just seconds away from a historic win against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal in Brazil on Sunday night that would have booked their place in the last 16 of the World Cup

Now the Americans may need at least a point Thursday against Germany to advance to the knockout stage.

They could advance with a loss, depending on the result of the Portugal-Ghana game that will be played simultaneously.

Van Persie didn't dignify U.S. Soccer's dig with a response.
