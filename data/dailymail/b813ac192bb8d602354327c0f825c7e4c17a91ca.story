The number of requests to hold illegal immigrants in jail ahead of deportation has dramatically reduced over the past two years, a new report claims.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) requests for 'detainers' - which are used to hold someone in prison while it organizes deportation proceedings - have dropped by 9,000 requests per month since 2012.

The Syracuse University report has been released just as President Barack Obama plans changes to the immigration system that would give up to five million migrants the right to remain in the U.S.

Released Wednesday, the report showed California and Texas registered the biggest reduction in 'detainer' requests across the financial years of 2012, 2013 and up to March this year.

Requests in California declined 55 per cent, and Texas 28 per cent.

The overall decline of 39 per cent translates to more than 100,000 fewer requests a year across the entire U.S.

Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner has refused to rule out a government shutdown as a means to block President Barack Obama from halting deportations for millions of illegal immigrants.

'All options are on the table,' Boehner said during a press conference yesterday, noting that Republicans in the House were still discussing their next move.

He said: 'Our goal here is to stop the president from violating his own oath of office and violating the Constitution. It's not to shut down the government.'

As Boehner walked away, a reporter tried to get him to state on the record that he would not allow a government shut down, but the GOP leader did not respond.

Yesterday Fox News reported that Obama would implement a 10-point plan to change the immigration system as early as next Friday, leading to a renewed effort among House Republicans to use an upcoming spending debate to force Obama's hand.

Fox said that a source close to the White House confirmed that Obama is looking to expand his deferred action program that allows children of illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S. indefinitely to include any one who came to the U.S. as a child.

The sweeping order would also allow parents of both citizen children and illegal immigrant children to remain in the U.S.

That portion of the directive alone could save as many as 4.5 million immigrants with U.S. born children from being removed from the country, Fox estimated.

And the section extending the president's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals could protect another 300,000. 

Instead of requiring that illegal immigrants applying for residency under the provision be under the age of 31 and provide proof that they arrived  before July of 2007, anyone who came to the country before January 1, 2010, when they were under the age of 16 would be eligible for DACA.

A half-million immigrants and their spouses could apply for citizenship through a State Department visa program for high-tech jobs. 

The president would likely direct ICE to focus on deporting criminals over other illegals, as well.

Obama was reportedly briefed on a draft of the plans on his way to Asia. The White House has yet to give its final seal of approval, however, the source told Fox News.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest today told reporters traveling with the president in Asia that Obama still hasn't made up his mind and would not make an announcement on immigration until after he returns to Washington, D.C. this weekend.

While Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has promised there will not be another government shut down, that doesn't mean that anti-amnesty zealots in his caucus, who have said they will use all procedural means available to stop Obama, won't give it another try.

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who will likely ascend to chairman of the budget committee when Republicans become the majority party next year, has said he wants to use the budget process to bar spending on any immigration reforms ordered up by Obama without the consent of Congress.
