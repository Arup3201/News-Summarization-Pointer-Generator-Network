It's no secret that goats were huge on social media in 2014, with Gary the Goat taking over YouTube.

And it looks like the furry creatures are set to maintain their top spot as online users' most loved animal - just behind cats - after this precious video emerged online.

The short clip shows new goat sensation Stephie indulging in a peanut butter treat on Boxing Day at Manning River Farm Animal Sanctuary.

'She is able to roam free about the property and often invites herself into our kitchen for some delicious snacks' the filmer - an owner of the farm - later wrote online. 

The Sanctuary took to their Facebook page to commend Stephie on her new status as the 'it' goat of Australia and to bring the goat back down to earth. 

'Our beautiful Stephie is a world wide hit. One little video of her eating peanut butter has gone crazy viral. We do hope she doesn't get all diva-ish on us.'

However, Manning River Farm Animal Sanctuary dispelled rumours that Stephie is addicted to peanut butter, claiming the happy goat has only had the tasty snack twice, as a treat.

However, she obviously enjoyed her treat as she can be seen savouring each piece of peanut butter in the video.

Manning River Farm Animal Sanctuary have made stars out of their farm animals after posting videos of them on YouTube. 

In recent months, the farm has posted a clip of a chicken purring like a cat, another chicken running off with a child's pacifier and a duck hosting a committee meeting with some new turkeys on the farm.
