Millions of customers are being targeted by sales-hungry Lloyds staff despite the bank’s appalling record on mis-selling.

Branches are under increased pressure to sell more insurance policies, loans and investments, secret documents reveal.

Despite racking up a £10billion bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI), Britain’s biggest bank has ordered staff to meet increased sales targets or face losing their bonuses – or even their job.

Cut throat: Staff at Lloyds, Britain's biggest bank, face losing bonuses or their job if they don't meet targets

And the edict was issued months after Lloyds – which was bailed out by the taxpayer in 2008 – was fined £28million by watchdogs over its ruthless sales culture and ‘champagne’ bonuses. 

The order to ramp up sales led one exasperated employee to post a message on the company’s intranet asking: ‘Will this bank never learn?’

The secret move was revealed by a whistleblower who has lifted the lid on the bank’s rapacious methods.

The whistleblower, a senior personal banking adviser at a North London branch of Lloyds, says staff fear for their jobs and are mis-selling insurance and investments just to hit their sales targets. 

To back up his claims, he has handed internal documents to the Daily Mail showing the latest targets. 

Lloyds has insisted it has eradicated the sales culture which has blighted so many of its 30million customers.

But managers raised their targets in March, the documents show. They reveal the elaborate points system Lloyds now uses to encourage staff to sell products to customers who walk into a High Street branch.

The system is skewed to encourage the sale of products which are more profitable for the bank but often riskier or more expensive for the customer. Selling a £10,000 loan generates 550 points while selling a junior cash Isa generates just 23.

Staff who fail to hit their targets miss out on their bonus – an important incentive to personal banking advisers whose average starting salary is just £19,055. 

The whistleblower, who asked not to be identified, said: ‘The bank pretends they don’t talk about sales but they do. Staff are being exploited by the bank and we are all under huge pressure.

‘It is difficult to give honest advice to customers. There is a clear incentive to lend as much to customers as possible. Most of us are not trying to get a bonus.

'Sometimes people are mis-selling to customers because they don’t want to be disciplined. Lots of advisers are on “red”, which means they haven’t hit their targets. People are afraid of losing their jobs.’ 

The employee came forward after the Mail published a leaked internal email last week which revealed the bank is continuing to pressure staff to mis-sell credit cards, loans and insurance.

In the memo, a regional manager chastised staff for failing to hit targets. Referring to the number of daily appointments advisers are expected to make, it warns: ‘I’ll give you a clue that 1s, 2s and 3s are simply not acceptable.’

The email, described by Lloyds Trade Union as ‘gratuitous, threatening and menacing’, emerged in the same week that the bank’s bill for mis-selling PPI topped £10billion – dwarfing the provisions made by its rivals.

Lloyds insisted the email ‘is in no way representative of behaviour across the group’, adding it had launched an internal investigation and was taking disciplinary action.

But the internal documents passed to the Mail reveal how Lloyds increased its sales targets for staff by more than a quarter in March – three months after the bank was fined £28million for promoting a ruthless sales culture.

Staff were handed bonuses for selling customers investments they did not want or need. One salesman sold insurance to himself, his wife and a colleague to prevent his salary from being cut.

Comments posted on the company’s intranet – in response to a weekly blog posted by Lloyds retail boss Owen Woodley – reveal the bitterness felt by some staff who feel under increased pressure.

Lloyds branch staff are awarded points for selling a product, such as an insurance policy or a fee-charging bank account.

They also earn points if they refer a customer to a Lloyds financial adviser who goes on to make a sale.

Each employee is given a quarterly sales target based on a multiple of 1.91 times their salary. So a worker earning an annual salary of £20,000 will have to generate 38,200 points every three months.

If they hit their target, they qualify for a bonus. Lloyds says employees also have to satisfy a range of other criteria, such as providing good customer service, in order to win bonuses.

But products that are more profitable for the bank – which tend to be either more risky or more expensive for the customer – will bring in more points towards their sales target.

So a tax-free cash Isa will generate just 45 points. But referring a customer to a financial adviser who then sells them a life insurance policy will generate 500 points for the frontline staff member.

If they refer a customer and it results in a mortgage sale they will get 1,200 points.

A frontline staff member who simply books an appointment with an investment manager for a customer will also receive 500 points.

A personal loan will generate 55 points per £1,000 borrowed – so the bigger the loan, the more points awarded.

One employee said: ‘[Is this] really the way to motivate staff and prevent mis-selling? Surely when we are supposed to be needs-based selling, the pressure should stop.’

Another said: ‘And so it begins again, the pressure to sell to our customers, targets for internet banking, targets for Club Lloyds, will this bank never learn!!!!’

But last night a Conservative MP said Lloyds’ staff could not absolve themselves from blame. Mark Garnier a member of the Treasury Select Committee said: ‘Frontline staff need to be exposed to sanctions for responding to flawed sales incentives. 

'A defence of “I was only obeying my bonus incentive scheme” is simply unacceptable. Sales staff have a crucial role to play in upping standards at banks and they must all be held responsible for bad practice, not just their managers.’

Lloyds said it has ditched straightforward sales targets, and said annual bonuses are based on ‘balanced scorecards’, which gauge feedback from customers.

But it admitted that targets for staff were increased in March. It refused to reveal the size of the bonuses available to staff, but said they are based on a percentage of salary. A spokesman said: ‘Our key objective is to help our customers manage their money in the best possible way.

‘Our training, processes and measures are focused on providing excellent service to our valued customers. We conduct regular reviews to ensure that customer needs are being appropriately met, but encourage our colleagues to talk to us if they do have any concerns.’
