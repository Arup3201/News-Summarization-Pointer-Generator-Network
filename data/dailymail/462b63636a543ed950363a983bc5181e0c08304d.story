ScottishPower today became the latest firm to announce eye-watering price rises, warning bills will go up by 9 per cent within weeks.

The firm, fined last week for mis-selling, claimed it could 'understand that these are difficult times for many families' but blamed rising wholesale prices and the government's 'social and environmental schemes'.

It came as it emerged David Cameron’s plans to ‘roll back’ the green levies on energy bills could see the costs passed on to the taxpayer.

Hike: ScottishPower became the latest firm to announce plans to increase bills by up to 9 per cent

Row: Prime Minster David Cameron stunned the Lib Dems with his pledge to 'roll back' green levies on energy bills but Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has refused to scrap help for elderly people

ScottishPower said that from December 6 domestic dual fuel prices would rise by an average of 8.6 per cent, adding £113 on the average bill.

Domestic gas prices will rise by an average of 8.5 per cent and electricity prices by 9 per cent.

In a statement the firm said: 'We understand that these are difficult times for many families and we have done all that we can to hold prices for as long as possible.

'However, following rises in wholesale energy costs, increased charges to deliver energy to your home and increased costs to support compulsory social and environmental schemes, ScottishPower is to increase domestic dual fuel prices by an average of 8.6% from 6th December 2013.'

It comes after the firm was ordered to pay £8.5million compensation to customers after an investigation by the industry regulator found they had mis-sold gas and electricity.

Households were given misleading estimates of how much they would pay for energy if they switched their supplier, Ofgem found.

German-owned supplier Npower has said it will increase charges by 10.4 per cent to an average of £1,491 per year.

And British Gas has announced a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent hike.

Ann Robinson, director of consumer policy at uSwitch.com, said: 'Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession.

'The danger is that these hikes are sweeping households towards a cliff edge – when bills hit £1,500 a year this will be the tipping point where many will have no choice but to go without heating. This will have a serious impact on health and well-being.'

The huge increases have increased 
pressure on the government to act against the power firms which continue to make substantial profits.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: 'With fifteen independent energy suppliers to choose from outside the Big 6, it’s surprising that these companies think they can keep getting away with bill hikes of this magnitude.

'As more and more people shop around for the competitive deals on the market, some of which are offered by the independents, companies like Scottish Power can no longer put their bills up in this way with no consequences.'

Mr
Cameron sparked a furious coalition row yesterday with his promise to 
cut green levies added to bills, with the Lib Dems accusing
him of making ‘panicky’ new energy policy ‘on the hoof’.

Today
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg made clear he would not allow funds 
which help the elderly to stay warm to be scrapped, but could be paid 
through taxes instead of through energy bills.

Labour
leader Ed Miliband has vowed to freeze bills for 20 years if he wins 
the next election, while former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Major this 
week called for a windfall tax on energy firms to help people stay warm 
this winter.

But during a 
fraught Prime Minister’s Questions Mr Cameron rejected both ideas, 
insisting: 'We need to roll back some of the green regulations and 
charges.’

The surprise move
caught the Lib Dems off guard, with Mr Clegg only told about the policy
change half an hour before it was made public.

Crisis: The latest run of price hikes by the energy firms has increased pressure on the government to help families struggling to pay the bills

David Cameron has 'lost control' of the government 's energy policy, Ed Miliband claimed today.

The Labour leader accused the Prime Minister of making up policy without taking on the Big Six energy firms.

Mr Miliband said in a speech to the Federation of Small Businesses:  'Yesterday was the day David Cameron lost control of his Government.

'In weakness and panic, he made up a policy on energy, which means business as usual for the energy companies, and which is already falling apart.

'There is no solution to the cost of living crisis which tiptoes around taking on the energy companies and reforming a broken market.

'But this Prime Minister is too weak to stand up for the consumer and he always takes the side of the Big Six companies.'

Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron are expected to discuss the fall-out of the row at the weekend.

But Mr Clegg today proposed funds raised on bills to pay for help for the elderly could instead be paid for from general taxation.

He told BBC Radio 4: ‘We could perhaps fund that through general government expenditure but one way or the other these levies we do need to help those 2 million families with their fuel bills.

‘I do not want to turn our backs on the poorest in society. I don't want to turn our back on the environment.’

He added: ‘All I care about is the objectives remain clear and stable, helping the fuel poor, keeping the lights on, getting homes insulated and supporting our green economy.’

In particular Mr Clegg is understood 
to be determined to protect the Warm Homes Discount, which pays £135 to 
the over-75s and poorest pensioners to help with their fuel bill.

It adds around £11 to the average dual-fuel energy bill, and would cost around £270million to fund from taxation.

A
senior Lib Dem source said: ‘You can put this stuff on people’s bills 
or you can fund it through general taxation but somebody has got to pay 
for it.’

The Energy 
Companies Obligation, which adds £47 to bills, is used for home 
improvements but is not restricted to the poorest households. It only 
came into force earlier this year.

Energy
Secretary Ed Davey is already concerned that the Big Six energy firms 
are not using the fund properly and it could be ‘tweaked’.

Mr Davey added: 'The Government is looking at how to get people’s energy bills as low as
possible to help hard-pressed households.

'We’ve already increased 
competition, brought new players in to the market to offer consumers 
real choice, and the most vulnerable people are getting direct help with
their bills this winter. We’ll continue this work to make sure 
consumers are getting a good deal.'

Energy
firm bosses have been called to Parliament to explain the dramatic 
rises at a time when families are struggling, with living costs rising 
at twice the rate of wages.

Downing
Street sources said that, if there was no policy change, green levies 
could rise from the current £112 to £194 - or 14 per cent of the typical
household bill - by 2020.

But Number 10 seemed unaware of Sir John’s dramatic intervention into the debate on bills, when he called for a windfall tax.

Sir John said: ‘I predict this winter – sod’s law being what it is - that we will probably have a very cold winter and it is not acceptable to me and ought not to be acceptable to anyone that many people are going to have to choose between keeping warm and eating.

‘That is not acceptable. And so if we get this cold spell, the government I think will have to intervene.

‘And if they do intervene and it is costly I for one would regard it as perfectly acceptable for them then subsequently to levy an excess profits tax on the energy companies and claw that money back to the Exchequer where the primary job is to get the economy working and people back to work.’
