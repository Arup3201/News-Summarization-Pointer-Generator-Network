Gus Poyet has reminded Sunderland’s doubters that victory against Everton would see them equal the tally of 14 points that they held on New Year’s Day last season.

The Black Cats suffered a disastrous first half of the campaign before beating the drop by the skin of their teeth. 

Gus Poyet says Monday night's win at Crystal Palace has boosted Sunderland

Jordi Gomez scored Sunderland's second goal at Selhurst Park 

‘This has been a better start,’ he said. ‘Last year took us so long to get to 10 points and (survival) was looking impossible.

‘Everything before the game (their 3-1 win at Crystal Palace on Monday) was so dark and negative. You need to win to change that and to show people it’s not all that bad.

‘Getting that win was massive. We had to stay positive and believe in what we do.’

And Poyet anticipates a less anxious feel to the Stadium of Light on Sunday.

‘Everything will feel different, even the stands and the supporters,’ said the Uruguayan.

Poyet and Fletcher celebrate at the final whistle
