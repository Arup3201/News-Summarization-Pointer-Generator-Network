A prostitute and her unemployed partner, arrested over the murder of a Gold Coast man after luring him with an online advertisement for sex, have faced court. 

33-year-old mother of three, Peta Lorang-Goubran,and her 28-year-old partner Mark Dayney were arrested on Wednesday over the murder of Gold Coast man Mark Emanuel Spencer, found bludgeoned to death on October 1.

Mr Spencer, 37, sustained severe head injuries at his Coomera home in what police have described as a targeted attack.

The couple have been remanded in custody after appearing at the Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday.

Mr Dayney reportedly blew a kiss to supporters as he was led from the dock at the Southport court on Thursday; one person in the room telling him to keep his 'chin up'.

The court heard Dayney was on bail when accused of participating in the murder, though his lawyer said the breach of bail charge against his client would be contested.

Ms Lorang-Goubran wept in the dock during her brief appearance.

Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said Mr Spencer had replied to an advertisement for sex on the classified website Craigslist, falling victim to the couple's  ploy.

'They had a plan together to go to the client's residence and actually rob that person,' he told reporters on the Gold Coast.

Detectives found a bloodied tennis racquet and broken baseball bat at the scene.

Police were unable to speculate how often similar sex-related robberies occur through classified sites like Craigslist -  but note the likely embarrassment of victims means perpetrators of such crimes are less-likely to be caught out.

'It is quite apparent that victims would be reluctant to report the matters to police and the offenders probably count on this being the case, particularly if drugs are also stolen,' Det Supt Hutchison told Daily Mail Australia.  

He said one other victim has been positively identified, as well as a number of other people who had communicated with Ms Lorang-Goubran via email and text messages but who never actually met up with her for various reasons.

Det Supt Hutchison is urging other victims to come forward to police.

'We would still like to speak to anyone who responded to any Craigslist advertisement for sexual services who were subsequently victims of robbery,' said Det Supt Hutchison.

'The manner in which these transactions occur creates significant risks for the ‘client’ as is the case with any online interactions where the identity, history and background of the other party is not known and cannot be validated,' Det Supt Hutchison said. 

There have been a number of similar Craigslist related crimes in the United States in recent years, including one case in which a newly-wed couple  created an escort ad on the site to lure a married engineer so they could kill him 'for the excitement' of it. They were sentenced to life in prison.

Mr Spencer reportedly knew Ms Lorang-Goubran but wasn't aware she was the prostitute responsible for the advertisement. 

The pair have been charged with murder and robbery with violence over Mr Spencer's death, as well as charges relating to a robbery in Holmview, south of Brisbane, the night before the murder.

A friend of Mr Spencer, Tim Stewart, said it was tough to face the father-of-two's alleged killers in the courtroom on Thursday.

'(I'm) very angry,' Mr Stewart told reporters when asked to describe his emotions. 'He (Mr Spencer) was a great person, beautiful kids, and he'll be truly missed.'

The matter will return to court on February 20.
