New Jersey man Baer Hanusz-Rajkowski was stunned to receive a bill for nearly $9,000 when his local hospital fixed up a cut finger he hurt during some home DIY.

Bayonne resident, Rajkowski, split his middle finger with the claw end of a hammer last August and was hit with the enormous charge by Bayonne Medical Center ER, despite only receiving a tetanus jab, swab and bandage.

For that level of care, an incredulous Rajkowski was sent a bill for $8,200 for the visit to the ER and on top of that he was charged $180 for a tetanus shot, $242 for sterile supplies and $8 for antibacterial wipes - plus hundreds more for the nurse who treated him.

Incredulous: Baer Hanusz-Rajowski said the bill he got from Bayonne Medical Center was unbelievable

'I got a Band-Aid and a tetanus shot. How could it be $9,000. This is crazy,' said Hanusz-Rajkowski to NBC New York.

'If I severed a limb, I’d carry it to the next emergency room in the next city before I go back to this place.'

However, Dr. Mark Spektor, who is the President and CEO of Bayonne Medical Center said that the high bill was the fault of Rajkowski's insurance company, United Healthcare.

The beginning of the problem was six years ago, when Carepoint Health purchased Bayonne Medical Center and made it a for-profit hospital.

Then Carepoint did not renew the in-network pricing contracts it had with United Healthcare.

This mean that Rajkowski's bills was enormous because United does not offer reimbursement rates.

'These sticker price charges only apply to ... a minority of patients whose insurance companies have refused to negotiate fair contracted prices with us,' said Spektor to NBC.

However, Mary McElrath-Jones, who works for United Healthcare said that Carepoint is simply trying to make money.

'United Healthcare is deeply concerned about hospitals establishing an out-of-network strategy to hike the rate they charge for emergency room services, often surprising patients,' said Jones to NBC.

Tough: Dr. Mark Spektor, President and CEO of Bayonne Medical Center, blamed the high ER bill on Hanusz-Rajkowski's insurance company

'Our members are very frustrated at receiving these egregious hospital bills so we are working to curtail outrageous billing and to help provide affordable healthcare options for our members.'

Spektor told NBC he would reveal the profit margin on Rajkowski's $8,200 hospital visit.

However, Linda Schwimmer, who is the vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute said that Bayonne charged almost ten times the going rate.

'I can tell you the right price is somewhere between the neighborhood of $400 and $1,000,' said Schwimmer to NBC.

'And I know that because I’ve called around and asked, but why doesn’t everybody know that?'

United Healthcare has settled its portion of the bill, about $6,640.

Bayonne waived Rajowski's portion of the bill following his complaints.
