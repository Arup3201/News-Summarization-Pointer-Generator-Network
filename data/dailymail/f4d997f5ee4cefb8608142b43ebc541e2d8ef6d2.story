Cleansing: Mrs Newton-John, pictured last week in Melbourne, Australia, flew in a Catholic priest to carry out an exorcism at her Florida home

Grease star Olivia Newton-John ordered an exorcism at her $5.6million Florida home to expel the spirit of a suicide victim.

Mrs Newton-John, 64, flew in a Catholic priest to conduct the ritual after Christopher Pariseleti, a 41-year-old contractor, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the house last month.

She is said to have ordered the cleansing ritual to reassure potential buyers that the property is not haunted.

The singer, 64, her husband John 
Easterling, 61, and two other friends attended the ceremony last week, 
where prayers were spoken and holy water sprinkled around rooms in the 
house, according to the Sunday Express.

The decision to hold the ritual was made after comedian Rosie O'Donnell pulled out of buying the home, for which she had previously offered $5.6million.

Despite the star cutting the asking price for the home by $320,000, there are still reportedly no interested parties.

An Orlando estate agent said: 'Unfortunately there is a grim notoriety to the house and people are put off by that.

Whoever buys the home will always know that someone blew their brains out in there. It is not the nicest housewarming present.'

Home: The property, said to be worth $5.6million, is in Jupiter, Florida

It was also reported that Mr Pariseleti, a married father of two, killed himself after he was refused a loan by Mrs Newton-John to keep his business afloat, and chose to do it on the property to disrupt the sale.

Officers in Jupiter revealed Mr Pariseleti's identity last month after an autopsy, which found he had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The custom home builder was working on Newton-John's $5.6 million mansion, jointly owned by Mrs Newton-John and Mr Easterling,, who were out of town at the time of the shooting.

A police statement said: 'This case investigation has been 
classified as a suicide and there are no suspicious circumstances 
surrounding the death of Mr Pariseleti.'

Jupiter
 Police spokesman Scott Pascarella said it appeared Mr Pariseleti had 
brought the handgun used in the incident to the house himself.

'Based on preliminary information, we believe the gun did not belong to anyone in the house,' Pascarella said.

Mr Pariseleti was the owner of Pariseleti Construction Inc. He had reportedly been working on this property for several months. Local residents say he was a well-liked figure.

Neighbor Marilyn Barfield told Celebuzz that Mr Pariseleti was popular as he was often working on different properties in the community.

'He's
 a longtime contractor of Olivia's. He did the total remodel on the 
house,' Mrs Barfield said. 'He was just the nicest person you ever want to 
meet. I can't believe it.'

'There was only one other person 
working over there at the time that I could see. I thought it could be 
the pressure cleaner working on the driveway. I didn't think it was a 
gun.'

A statement from Mrs Newton-John's publicist at the time said: 'Olivia and her husband John are in shock over the 
tragic event that occurred at their Florida home yesterday.

'At
 this time we are awaiting additional information from investigators 
but, can confirm that the couple was not in Florida at the time and the 
deceased was not a family member.'

Newton-John's
 hits include You're The One That I Want with John Travolta from the 
1978 film Grease.

The singer and her husband were trying to sell the 
home and had reportedly found a buyer in Rosie O'Donnell, who sold her own Miami mansion for $16.5 million in 
June.

But she is now said to have pulled out of the deal in the wake of the suicide.
