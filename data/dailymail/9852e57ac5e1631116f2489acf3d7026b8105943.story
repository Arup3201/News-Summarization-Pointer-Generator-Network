Britain's most senior family judge was yesterday asked to annul 180 divorces granted to Italian couples after they were exposed as being fraudulent.

Sir James Munby, president of the Family Division, heard that couples from the devoutly Roman Catholic country had assumed fake residencies in the UK to avoid the lengthy and often costly Italian divorce process.

The scam was exposed when court officials realised that, in 179 of the cases, one of the divorcing parties had given the same home address in High Street, Maidenhead, Berkshire, which was not a residential property, but a post office box, the High Court was told.

Quickie split: Italian couples have been found to go abroad to divorce to avoid the lengthy and expensive process in their home countries

The petitioner in the 180th case gave an address in Epsom, Surrey. All the spouses being divorced claimed to live in Italy.

Simon Murray, for the Queen’s Proctor – the lawyer whose job is to protect the integrity of the divorce process – is asking Sir James to overturn the decrees nisi and decrees absolute that have been granted in all 180 cases.

Couples wishing to get divorced in Italy face a mandatory three-year legal separation period, but they can avoid this by taking advantage of European Union legislation that recognises divorces granted in any member state.

After obtaining foreign residency, they can in many countries file for divorce after six months. Romania, in particular, has reportedly become a destination of choice for Italian divorce tourists.

But it is illegal to use a bogus residency for these purposes.

Until lies do us part: The scam was exposed when officials notices that in 179 of the cases, one of the divorcing parties had the same Berkshire address.

Mr Murray said: ‘Italian couples were charged some 4,000 euros in each case for a fast-track divorce, with a post office box in Maidenhead being used to establish residency. It seems that this was a fraud. The decrees should be rescinded.

‘It is a requirement of the law of England and Wales that a person seeking a divorce in the English and Welsh courts has been habitually resident in England for a period of at least one year immediately before issuing a petition of divorce, or that the respondent was habitually resident within the jurisdiction.

‘The English and Welsh courts have no jurisdiction to consider divorce applications by parties who are both resident abroad.’

Mr Murray said that, of the 180 couples, all but two said they would not oppose their divorces being rescinded. He added that a representative of the Italian government was in court to observe proceedings, along with Thames Valley Police officers.

The hearing continues.
