A hot air balloon carrying an American family has crashed in Switzerland, killing the father and seriously injuring his wife and their two daughters.

The craft came down in the hill town of Montbovon, to the west of the country, after colliding with electric power lines and plummeting 165 feet to earth.

Medics rushed to the scene but were unable to resuscitate the 55-year-old father while his wife, also 55, and two daughters, 20 and 24, were taken by helicopter to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries.
