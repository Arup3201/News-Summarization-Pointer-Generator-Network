Third parties working on West Ham’s behalf are currently working on a move for Valencia ahead of the new season.

Valencia scored 18 goals in 23 games for Pachuca last season, but it’s his exploits on the international stage that has thrust him into the limelight.

He has scored seven times in 13 appearances for his country, including three goals for Ecuador during the World Cup.

Valencia also scored in the 2-2 draw against England in Miami last month.

The Hammers are committed to strengthening their squad this summer after last season’s difficulties.

They have already signed Aaron Cresswell, Diego Poyet, Mauro Zarate and Cheikhou Kouyate this summer.

West Ham have also bid £9.5million for Ukraine winger Yehven Konoplyanka, who plays for Dnipro.
