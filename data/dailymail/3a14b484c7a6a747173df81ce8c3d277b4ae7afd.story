The Red Sox paid an emotional tribute to the people of Boston this afternoon in a moving pregame ceremony at Fenway Park, the first time since last Monday's deadly terrorist attacks that killed three and left more than 180 wounded.

Designated hitter David Ortiz exclaimed 'this is our f***ing city' to rapturous cheers, and some tears, after a moving video, encapsulating the horror and heroism of the past few days, played on the big screen.

Proud Bostonians could be seen watching the game, many of them clutching American flags. The city used the significant sporting event to honor the victims and offer gratitude to the police, firefighters and medical personnel as well as strangers who risked their lives to save others after the senseless attacks.

'All right, Boston,' said Ortiz. 'This jersey that we wear today, it doesn't say Red Sox. It says Boston.

He continued: 'We want to thank you, Mayor Menino, Governor Patrick, the whole police department for the great job they did this past week. This is our f***ing city, and nobody is going to dictate our freedom. Stay strong.'

The Boston team, rather than wearing their traditional 'Red Sox' embroidered across the chest, wore crisp white uniforms that simply read 'Boston,' with a 'B Strong' logo. The team said their uniforms would be autographed and auctioned to raise money for the charity established to help the victims, called One Fund Boston.

During the video, the crowd applauded when images of the brave Carlos Arredondo appeared on the screens and it increased when pictures and quotations from President Obama, Governor Patrick and Mayor Menino were shown.

It was accompanied by Jeff Buckley's rendition of 'Hallelujah.'

When the footage moved to the manhunt for 19-year-old Dzhokar A Tsarnev in Watertown, the fans were on their fans cheering.

At that point, law enforcement and first responders walked onto the field and formed a line in front of the Red Sox dugout.

Moments of silence were then held for Marathon victims, eight-year-old Martin Richard, Krystle Campbell and Lu Lingzi and MIT police officer Sean Collier, who was killed Thursday night in a shootout between the Tsarnaevs.

Citizen heroes Matt Patterson and Steve Byrne were also brought out, along with Dick Hoyt and his disabled son Rick, whom he pushed in 31 Boston Marathons.

Neil Diamond flew into town for the event and requested to sing 'Sweet Caroline.' The artist gave a live performance in the eighth inning of the Fenway staple.

As Diamond, a New York native who wore a Red Sox cap, left the field, fans chanted 'U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'

'You give people hope,' Ortiz said. 'We wanted to let them know we're here for them.'

Across town, the Bruins also returned to the ice after postponing their game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on Friday night.

The emotional tribute came after baseball
 stadiums around the U.S. erupted into cheers last night as news that 
police had captured the second Boston bombings suspect was plastered 
across the big screens.

A touching video put together by MLB.com shows the moment fans, and players, learn that the intense 24 hour manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnev is over, leaving the city of Boston to breathe a huge sigh of relief.

From Texas to New York, fans of rival teams came together to show their support for the people of Boston, who spent yesterday in lockdown as police searched tirelessly for the suspect.

Dzhokhar Tsarnev, and his late brother 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnev, are accused of killing three people and injuring over 170 after they detonated twin bombs just seconds apart at the finish line of the Boston Marathon on Monday.

Fans at the Cincinnati Reds Vs Marlins game stood in their seats and clapped as the words 'BREAKING NEWS: SUSPECT ALIVE AND IN CUSTODY' came onto the big screen at the Great American ballpark.

At Minute Maid Park in Texas, Houston fans and Cleveland Indian supporters high-fived each other as the suspect's capture was announced to the crowd.

The announcer at one of the games can be heard in the video saying: 'That is certainly good news. Let the good people of Boston get back to normal.'

Spectators at the New York Mets vs Washington Nationals game in the Big Apple also erupted in cheers as the news broke.

Other
 stadiums honored the beloved, but heartbroken, city by playing Neil 
Diamond's 'Sweet Caroline,' the signature tune of Boston's Fenway Park.

Yesterday's Boston Red Sox Vs the Royals game was postponed because the city was in lockdown.

However,
 today's game will go on as scheduled and, given the week's events and 
the fact the contest falls on the 101st birthday of the Boston stadium, 
it is bound to be a memorable one.
