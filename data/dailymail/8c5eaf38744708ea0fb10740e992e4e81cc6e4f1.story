Sanchez, who is in great form for Arsenal and has found the net eight times in the Premier League, broke the deadlock with a header in the 17th minute.

Chile dominated the friendly in the southern city of Talcahuano and went 2-0 up in first-half stoppage time with a low shot from Jorge Valdivia, who was returning to 'La Roja' after reconsidering his decision to quit the team after the World Cup.

Valdivia's influence grew in the second half as Chile overwhelmed Venezuela.

'I'm back and I'm happy,' Valdivia said. 'I trained hard to be back and I hope this is the first step of a good history with Chile.'
