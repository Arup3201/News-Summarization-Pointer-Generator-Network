Call them the ‘adven-sioners’ – today’s retirees are making ambitious plans to go abroad and fulfil their travel dreams as they enter their golden years.

Luxury getaways, classic road trips and thrilling activities in exotic locations are near the top of their itineraries, according to a survey that asked 1,000 retirees to reveal the ‘ultimate bucket list’ of locations they want to see and things they want to do.

Travelling to Norway to see the Northern Lights was voted the most desired activity or destination by more than one million retirees.

Incredible sight: Viewing the Northern Lights in Norway is at the top of many retirees' bucket lists

A quarter of retirees say they want to reward themselves with a relaxing cruise in the sun-soaked Caribbean, while 23 per cent are keen to take a scenic train trip across Europe.

Showing their adventurous side, 20 per cent say they want to view the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas strip during an exhilarating helicopter ride.

Rounding out the top five is a romantic gondola ride in Venice.

The survey by Fidelity Worldwide Investment suggests a new breed of adventurous pensioners – or ‘adven-sioners’ – is set to take the travel world by storm.

Retirees are planning to jet to destinations around the globe and make the most of their retirement – and their savings.

Indian adventure: 17% of retirees said they would like to see the Taj Mahal in India

Visiting the Pyramids in Egypt was voted number 10 on retirees' bucket lists 

Two in five retirees admit they have drawn up a ‘bucket list’ of things they would like to achieve. 

Three quarters of those who have written up a list want to fulfil their travel dreams and capitalise on the things they didn’t do when they were raising children and moving up the ladder at work.

Despite having ambitious and costly plans, most retirees are taking a realistic approach to their travel dreams.

Just one in five think they will be able to tick everything off their must-do list. 

Wild time: 17% of retirees named an African safari among the top 10 things they want to do

Of those who think they will be able to accomplish everything, almost a quarter fear poor health could bring a halt to their plans, while almost half worry their nest egg will be too small.

Maike Currie, associate investment director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: ‘People no longer see hitting age 65, traditionally the so-called "retirement age", in the same light as they did in the past.' 

He added: ‘Many people over 65 are healthy, active and independent. As the survey’s findings show, rather than slowing down and taking it easy, today’s retirees plan to live life to the full.

‘They are keen to travel the world and make the most of their golden years. In many ways "65 is the new 50".

American adventure: A road trip along Route 66 was voted number seven on the bucket list

Research suggests the early years of retirement may be the best time to complete a bucket list because health reasons and spending are less likely to get in the way.

According to the study, monthly spending is highest in the latter stages of retirement (ages 70 to 74), with a total average of £936 to £1,005 per month.

In the earlier stages of retirement (ages 60 to 64), spending averages £874 a month.

More than half of retirees believe their regular monthly outgoings will rise over the next five years with most putting this down to rising living costs, the study found.
