WHAT HE WANTS

Green & Blacks Easter Tasting Collection, 540g, £14.99

What a treat! In this box there is a large, dark chocolate egg accompanied by 24 mini bars of Green & Blacks signature flavours - including the delicious sea salt and butterscotch.

WHAT SHE'LL LOVE

Sea salt caramel truffle Easter Egg, 170g, £15, Prestat

This
 is so elegant, with its packaging complete with a Royal Warrant (the 
Queen Mother was famously a huge fan and her daughter is rumoured to be 
too). The egg, with runny sweet-salty caramel truffles within, is 
utterly delectable.

FOR A HUNGRY BOY

Monster Egg Truck, 90g, £3, Sainsbury’s

Almost all little boys love cars and this is a great one! Big wheels, bright colours - and it's got a huge chocolate egg inside. Great value for something that will keep him busy for hours and hours.

FOR A SWEET GIRL

Chococo egg box, 150g, £9.50, Firebox

This lovely packaging reminds me of the toy sweet shop I had when I was a little girl. Each of the six eggs in the box is filled with a treat: milk chocolate eggs, jelly beans or chocolate beans.

FOR THE TRENDY TEEN

STAS Chocolate Easter Egg Head, 300g, £11.95 Harvey Nichols

This is great fun - and the moustache gives it some 'cool factor' too (they're apparently very on trend). You take the pot of caramel goo and use it to stick on the eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, moustache and beard to create your own bespoke Easter egg in minutes!

MAKE DAD'S DAY

Belgian Milk Chocolate Egg with Hazelnuts and mini eggs 380g, £10, Tesco

The quality of the chocolate in the Tesco Finest range is excellent. This is made from a creamy Galaxy-esque chocolate with sugary nibs of caramelised hazelnuts - it'll certainly keep your father sweet.  

MOTHER'S DELIGHT

Luxury assortment of hollow eggs, 260g, £10, M&S

Easter eggs this year are superb value and these ones are particularly fun - a line-up of five eggs: two dark, two milk and one white, with different toppings. The ginger is my favourite, but the raspberry, butterscotch and chocolate button options are also yummy.

FOR GREEDY GRANNY

Farga Antique Egg, 150g, £21.99, Selfridges

It's not really befitting for a lady of a certain age to be bashing a large egg on the kitchen counter to crack it. But with this, she can simply open the pretty keep-sake box and inside are nine praline eggs and six sugar-coated eggs.

FOR GLUTTONOUS GRANDPA

Moser Roth Milk Chocolate Egg with Chocolate Selection, 244g. £3.99 ALDI

Nobody would ever guess this was from ALDI - it's very reasonable and the hollow chocolate egg is absolutely yummy. Better yet, it comes with a selection of chocolates with traditional fillings such as caramel and coconut.

The Ultimate Egg, £90 from Fortnum & Mason

THE EGGSTRAVAGANT ONE

The Ultimate Egg, 1.4kg, £90, Fortnum and Mason

Yes, it's very expensive, but was there ever an egg more deserving of its name? The giant egg is filled with a series of five chocolate eggs. The largest egg is milk, then white, then three dark blends made from 50 per cent, 72 per cent and 100 per cent cocoa respectively.

IF YOU'RE NOT SHELLING OUT

Chokablok American Dreamcake Easter Egg, 300g, £5, Tesco

When the Good Housekeeping Institute tested Easter eggs this year, this bargain offering was their favourite. The combination of white chocolate studded with brownies and swirled with chocolate frosting is a chocolate-lover's dream.

FOR WHITE CHOCOLATE FANS

Venchi Gran Gourmet Bianco Salato, 500g, £43, Venchi

This is such a luxurious egg. It is made of vanilla-flecked white chocolate, set with hazelnuts, almonds and pistachios. There’s a little pouch inside the egg containing a pretty necklace and earrings, which makes the cost seem more reasonable!

GO DAIRY-FREE

Choices Dairy Free Confectionery Egg, 120g, £4.99 Holland and Barrett

If you have a child or friend who is allergic to dairy products, this is the egg for them. It doesn’t taste exactly the same as milk chocolate, but it’s still pretty good and is a fantastic option for anyone with allergies as it is also gluten-, wheat- and egg-free.

Rococo praline filled egg shell

FOR EASTER DESSERT

Rococo praline filled egg shell in eggcup, 40g, £9.95 John Lewis

This is so clever. Inside the little egg cup is a real hen's eggshell - but filled with praline! Heat it in the microwave, then tap the top, and instead of soldiers, dip pieces of fruit into the smooth hazelnut praline inside.

FOR YOUR EGG HUNT

30 hollow milk chocolate eggs, 500g, £10 M&S

These are a bargain - the eggs work out at 33p each - and they are just the right size for an Easter egg hunt: big enough so you can find them when they are hidden; not so big that you have to worry if your kids find a few of them.
