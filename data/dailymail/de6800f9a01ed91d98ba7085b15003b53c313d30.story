A barber has been charged after allegedly slashing a man's neck with a cut-throat razor in his city centre shop.

Lloyd Dobrodumow, 44, appeared at North Tyneside Magistrates’ Court after the suspected attack on Robert Charles Smith, 31, at Jack’s barber in Newcastle, which was allegedly sparked by a row over a discarded beer can.

The father-of-three, whose tongue-in-cheek Twitter name is Demon Barber, appeared at North Tyneside Magistrates' Court charged wounding with intent to cause grevious bodily harm.

Allegations: Lloyd Dobrodumow, 44, (pictured right leaving North Tyneside Crown Court today) has been charged after allegedly slashing a man's neck in Newcastle city centre

Wearing a smart jacket, the father from Bedford Place, Bensham, spoke only to confirm his name and address.

He was remanded in custody and will appear at Newcastle Crown Court on June 26.

The alleged victim was left with a 6-7ins wound to his neck as well as damage to nerves, muscle and a gland, Ms Jordan told the court.

District Judge Stephen Earl declined jurisdiction of the case and said the allegations were too serious to be dealt with by the magistrates' courts.

Judge Earl said: 'I'm left with a bizarre set of circumstances but there is a man that has a very serious injury as a result of those circumstances.'

The shop reopned yesterday following the terrifying incident, which left a man in hospital on Tuesday night.

The drama unfolded during rush hour while hundreds of commuters made their way home.

Emergency services were called just after 5pm on to the shop near Newcastle’s Central Station to reports of a stabbing.

A man was seen coming out of the barber’s allegedly clutching his neck, and blood stained the pavement outside the shop.

Police said that a man was taken to Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary with neck injuries and remains in hospital in a stable condition.

The incident shocked workers and residents in the area, with many expressing their horror in the aftermath of the attack.

Some shops in the area were forced to close while a police cordon was put up around the barber shop and surrounding businesses.

One
 business owner, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I had to close 
from 5pm to 6pm because of it - the police cordon was around.

'I opened up again but there was no one about so I just had to close again.

'I don’t know what happened though, as I was in the back.'

A woman who works nearby said: 'I got a call from my duty manager about it. I couldn’t believe it.'

Another man who was due in the barber’s today said he called up to cancel his appointment.

Dobrodumow's nickname stems from a similar business, The Demon Barber Shop, he used to run nearby.

He also used it as his Twitter name, and was reasonably well known with more than 100 followers.

A number of other male hairdressers around the country operate their business under the satirical name.

A Northumbria Police spokesman has confirmed the barber has been charged following an investigation which was launched on Tuesday.

He said: 'Police were called to Grainger Street, in Newcastle city centre, at 5.09pm on Tuesday, June 10, following reports of an assault.

'Lloyd Anthony Dobrodumow, has been charged with wounding with intent to commit grievous bodily harm.'
