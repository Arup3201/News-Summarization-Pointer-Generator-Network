Dead: Authorities said 27-year-old Sawyer Flache fired multiple rounds at a police helicopter in Austin before a police officer shot and killed him

A gunman was shot dead after repeatedly firing at a police helicopter dispatched to investigate reports of someone shooting out streetlights. 

Sawyer Flache, 27, fired multiple rounds at a police helicopter in a Southwest Austin neighborhood before a police officer on the ground shot and killed him in the early hours of Sunday.

Neighbours called 911 after seeing a heavily-armed man, later identified as Flache, shooting at street lighting at about 10.30pm on Saturday. The helicopter was dispatched along with officers on the ground and a SWAT team.

Police say officers on the ground took cover for about an hour a half while Flache kept shooting from his driveway. He was armed with pistols, rifles and other high-powered weapons.  

Flache began firing at the helicopter just after midnight, and continued firing multiple rounds for about the next 30 minutes, according to authorities.

At least one of the bullets hit the aircraft's rotor blades. 

Police Chief Art Acevedo said the sniper shot and killed him as Flache continued to fire at the helicopter. He died at the scene. 

Flache's family have since paid tribute to the 'loving father'. 

'Sawyer Flache was a loving father to two beautiful daughters,' the statement read. 

'He lived his life to provide for his girls, and made many wonderful memories that will be cherished. 

'The outpouring of support and love from his friends and family is a testament to his true spirit. He will be greatly missed.' 

Austin Police Department said three reverse 911 calls went out to 41 neighbors near SWAT standoff location. 

The chopper took at least one bullet to its blades, but safely returned to the station near Austin Bergstrom-International Airport.
