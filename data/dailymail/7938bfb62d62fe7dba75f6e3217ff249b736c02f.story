French golfer Thomas Levet took a break from participating in the Hassan II Trophy in Morocco on Friday to show off his absurdly impressive balancing skills.

The 46-year-old performed the trick, involving three clubs and one ball, as he waited to tee off from the eighth hole during round two of the European Tour event.

Fellow competitor Mikko Korhonen captured the quite unbelievable moment before sharing it with his Twitter followers.

'On a slow round of golf it's nice to have some entertainment! @thomaslevetgolf balancing it out,' the Fin wrote on Twitter alongside the picture.

Levet would have been happy to momentarily take the attention away from his golf. Having shot and 11 over par 83 on Thursday, Levet followed it up with a second round 78 to end his tournament 17 over par.

Rafa Cabrera-Bello, Richard Green, Richie Ramsay and Oliver Farr lead the way on six under par at the end of day two.
