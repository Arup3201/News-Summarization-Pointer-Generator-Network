Two women were shot to death and their bodies dumped in a South Carolina forest by a pair of cousins they were friends with, police said.

The bodies of 18-year-old Dana Woods and June Guerry, 22 were found in Francis Marion National Forest not far from their burned out car, several days after they went missing.

Caleb Brad Matlock and Arthur Ray Chavis, both 23, have been charged with their murder.

As the women's grieving families come
to terms with their deaths Guerry's sister, Rachel, has revealed that 
the young mother used to date Chavis.

All four were known to be friends, Berkeley County Sheriff’s Capt. Rick Ollic told The Post and Courier of South Carolina.

Woods and Guerry were last seen on August 26 eating at a Burger King restaurant with a friend, on their way to McDonald's.

In telephone conversations Woods told both her boss and her mother that she was giving someone a ride home.

On August 28 investigators found 
Woods' slain body close to the car she drove, after an intensive search 
involving dogs and dive teams.

Guerry was found days later, about 10 miles away. They had both died from gun shot wounds.

Police wouldn't say what led them to 
Matlock and Chavis, but a missing persons report states that a witness 
saw Woods' car close to the forest, being driven by a man.

According to the Post and Courier Guerry's mother had told police her daughter named Chavis who lived in that area.

Woods was a student and worked at Papa John's, Guerry at Walmart. Both were graduates of Timberland High School.

The Berkley County community reacted with shock to news of their deaths, holding vigils and laying flowers.

'I'm glad justice is going to be served,' friend Melissa Still told ABC News, adding that knew not just the victims but their killers, too.

'They (the suspects) were just normal 
people. We played together. We talked together. I just don't 
understand it, and it shocked me more than anything and it angered me, 
too.

'Those girls didn't deserve what happened to them and the families 
don't deserve it either.'

Chavis was on probation from a 2011 burglary conviction, police records show. Both remain in custody, having been denied bail.
