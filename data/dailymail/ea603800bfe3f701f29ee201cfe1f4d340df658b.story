For more than half a century James Bond has always drunk Vodka Martinis - 'shaken, not stirred'.

But now Bond actor Daniel Craig has swapped his traditional beverage for a bottle of Heineken as he stars in a controversial new advert.

Although the movies have long been filmed with carefully placed products, by filming a standalone advert 007 has gone a stage further.

The ad, which also promotes the new Bond film Skyfall, is part of a £28million tie in with the Dutch brewer.

Neither shaken, nor stirred: Bond, played by Daniel Craig, drinks a bottle of Heineken with co-star Berenice Marlohe

Controversial: The £28 million product placement deal with Heineken in the new film Skyfall was needed, Daniel Craig said, for the film to be made

James Bond has previously flashed an 
Omega watch in a commercial - but now he has swapped his traditional drink to promote a lager.

He is also seen drinking Heineken in the new movie out next month.

Bond has been forced to tout himself to the highest bidders as the film-makers MGM have tackled financial difficulties.

It is four years since Quantum of Solace was released and the shooting of Skyfall was delayed two years ago because of funding problems.

Daniel Craig appears alongside Berenice Marlohe in the advert and he said the film would not have been completed if the beer tie-in had not been agreed.

'We have relationships with a number of companies so that we can make this movie,' Daniel Craig told website Moviefone.

'The simple fact is that, without them, we couldn't do it. It's unfortunate but that's how it is. This movie costs a lot of money to make, it costs nearly as much again if not more to promote, so we go where we can.

Chase: James Bond is pursued by a group of villains on a snowy train station platform at the start of the commercial

'The great thing is that Bond is a 
drinker, he always has been, it's part of who he is, rightly or wrongly,
 you can make your own judgement about it, having a beer is no bad 
thing, in the movie it just happens to be Heineken.'

Bond has always drunk Vodka Martinis 
'shaken, not stirred' since the line appeared in Ian Fleming's 
1956 novel Diamonds are Forever.

The film makers insist he has drunk beer in the past so remains true to his routes, and he will still be seen drinking a Vodka Martini in the upcoming movie.

In the commercial, as Bond sneaks his way onto the train
 the unfortunate commuter is chased by the villains and Daniel Craig gets himself a Heineken at the bar.

The the very first Bond bad guy - the 
sinister Dr No portrayed by the late Joseph Wiseman - also turns up as a 
passenger thanks to some CGI wizadry.

At the end of the advert, Bond parachutes out of the train to the classic Bond theme tune.

Skyfall is one of the most hotly anticipated films of 2012 and opens in cinemas nationwide on October 26. It is has been four years since the last film Quantum of Solace.

American Beauty director Sam Mendes 
is at the helm and Oscar-winner Javier Bardem stars as villain Raoul 
Silva while Dame Judi Dench returns as spy chief M.

The new Heineken commercial begins with a pursuit of James Bond at a train station covered in snow.

The secret agent bumps into a man wearing the same clothes and the villains mistake him for the spy.

The Bond girls are played by Marlohe 
and Naomie Harris in Skyfall which also stars Ralph Fiennes, Albert 
Finney and Ben Wishaw as the new Q.
