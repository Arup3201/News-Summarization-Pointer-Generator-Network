A bride-to-be left paralysed by a rare spinal condition made a staggering recovery to walk down the aisle to marry her husband.  

Leigh Cooke Bennett woke up one morning to find that she was paralysed from the waist down.

But determined not to be wheelchair-bound at her  wedding, the 43-year-old endured hours of physiotherapy to regain her strength.

And to her delight, the bride-to-be was able to take her first steps down the aisle on her big day, to marry her husband Phil.   

Leigh Cooke Bennett, 34, from York, was left paralysed from the waist down by a  rare spinal condition, but with determination and gruelling physiotherapy sessions she was able to walk to meet her groom Phil, (pictured left) and was even able enjoy a first dance with her him on the big day (pictured right)

After experiencing numbness and pins and needles in her foot, one day Mrs Cooke Bennett woke up unable to move her lower body. She went to see a neurologist who diagnosed rare spinal condition transverse myelitis (TM) within seconds of hearing about her symptoms

Mrs Cooke Bennett, from York, said: 'I knew that no matter what, I wanted to be able to walk down the aisle. 

'I didn't want to use a crutch or a wheelchair - I wanted to be able to walk to meet my groom - like every woman dreams of.

'The wedding was a great motivation for me and helped me focus on my recovery.

'As I walked I just felt so proud, it was always going to be the best day of my life, but that made it even better. It was incredible.'

Mrs Cooke Bennett was struck down with transverse myelitis (TM) in August last year.

The condition occurs when the immune system attacks the spinal cord, and in the worst cases can leave sufferers completely paralysed.

Mrs Cooke Bennett first realised something was wrong when she started to experience numbness andpins and needles in her feet.

Transverse myelitis is a rare disease of the central nervous system involving inflammation in the spinal cord.

The inflammation causes swelling which can bock nerve impulses travelling along the spinal cord.

Most people with transverse myelitis experience weakness and a change in sensation or unusual feelings in the lower half of the body and have problems with their bowel and bladder.

Commonly, the onset of transverse myelitis is sudden and it can progress to its most severe state very quickly, often in just 24 to 48 hours.

However, for some people affected by transverse myelitis, their symptoms develop slowly over several weeks.

She said: 'It gradually crept up on me over a three week period.

'I started noticing things like my foot would go dead or I'd get pins and needles.

'Then I woke up one morning and I was totally numb from the waist down - I was basically paralysed.'

She was referred to see a neurologist who diagnosed the condition within seconds of hearing the symptoms. 

She said: 'I asked her if I would ever recover - she said that one in three people make no recovery at all.

'It was just a case of wait and see what happens, it was very scary.'

Mrs Cooke Bennett immediately started rehabilitation in an attempt to regain movement and feeling in her legs.

Two months after her diagnosis in October, her husband proposed.

'I'd dropped hints at Phil for ages that I'd love to get married, but with everything else that was going on with my recovery it wasn't on my mind.' she said.

'He caught me totally off guard. 'Then at the end of the year it was time to make a New Year's resolution and I decided I wanted to make one that was important.

On the 22nd of August, Leigh and Phil Cooke Bennett married in a humanist ceremony. She was able to walk down the aisle unaided

Leigh and Phil Cooke made the decision to get married two months after she was diagnosed with transverse myelitis, giving the future Mrs Cooke something to focus her recovery on 

'Suddenly it came to me - I was going to walk down the aisle at my wedding.

'As soon as I told my friends and family they were completely on board and we all decided we'd do whatever it took.

'I immediately stepped up and I worked hard at my rehab.

'I told my physio my plan, and as a bride to be herself, she was determined to get me to my goal. 

'I was so focused - there was no way I was going to give up.'

Over the course of the next eight months, Mrs Cooke Bennett worked during physiotherapy sessions and slowly began to see results.

Walking down the aisle was a 'dream come true' for Mrs Cooke Bennett

She said: 'My physio and I worked tirelessly.

'We spent each session talking about weddings, and we set interim goals to make it easier.

'Things like stand up on my own, walk a certain distance, or only use one crutch - it made it more manageable.

'It was hard but by about June, it dawned on me that I was really going to be able to do it.'

On the August 22, Leigh and Phil Cooke Bennett  married in a humanist ceremony - and she was able to walk down the aisle unaided.

Achieving her goal was a dream come true, especially as she was able to dance with her new husband on their wedding day, she said,

'The whole day was absolutely brilliant.

'As soon as I came into the marquee, to walk up to Phil, I just burst into tears.

'I was nervous, but I knew I could do it.'

The lady who led the ceremony explained to the room that it had been a difficult year Mrs Cooke Bennett, and that she'd achieved her dream.

She said: 'The whole room erupted into a round of applause. It was really emotional.

'For the rest of the day I was determined to stay on my feet, and I was even able to dance with Phil and all of our guests.

'For a few days afterwards it really took it out of me but it was all well worth it.

'I still have a little way to go in my recovery as I get tired, but I'm almost there.

'I'm over the moon to have been able to walk down the aisle, it was the best day ever.'
