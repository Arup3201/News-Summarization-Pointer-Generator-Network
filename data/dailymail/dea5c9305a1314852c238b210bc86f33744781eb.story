Eight players from Catalan Dragons have been named in coach Richard Agar's initial 23-strong France squad for the 2014 European Championship.

They include Paris-born, Sydney-raised forward Jason Baitieri, who succeeds club-mate Olivier Elima as captain.

Elima, who is thought to have retired from the international game, has been omitted, along with other Test regulars Remi Casty, who has been with Sydney Roosters this season, Thomas Bosc and Gregory Mounis.

Catalan full-back Morgan Escare has declared himself fit after hobbling off during Thursday's semi-final defeat at St Helens. 

The squad includes two 19-year-old centres, Thibaud Margalet, of St Esteve, and Avignon's Ben Jullien, who are among six potential debutants.

The winner of the European Championships will secure a place in the 2016 Four Nations.
