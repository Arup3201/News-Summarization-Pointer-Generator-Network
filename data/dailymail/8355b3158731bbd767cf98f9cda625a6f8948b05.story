A Pennsylvanian company is making play houses for the kids of super-rich families - with each costing thousands of dollars - in hopes of giving children 'a place of their own to grow and discover'.

Lilliput Play Homes, based in Finleyville, Pennsylvania, ships 30 variations of play houses around the world, some of which cost nearly $20,000.

The meticulously built homes are habitable miniatures of their big-brother mansions, equipped with furniture, lighting, air conditioning and even cutlery in the kitchen. 

Through the four-foot-tall front door - which has a door bell and brass knocker - rooms are decorated with carpets, floor coverings and floor-length curtains.

Customers can add on to the homes with swings, slides, climbing walls, crawl-through tunnels, picnic tables and flowers in the front garden. 

The custom-built play homes can be designed as turreted castes, theatres and shops with shelves and counters for the children to play with and explore. 

Lilliput founder Stephen Chernicky said that the company was created after he and his wife were searching for a play house for their daughter but couldn't find 'a product special enough', according to the company's website.

They created their first Victorian Mansion for their daughter Alyssa more than 20 years ago and through the process came Lilliput Play Homes.
