Iran's players have been warned by their football association they could face punishment if they take selfies with female fans at the Asian Cup.

The head of the Iranian Football Federation moral committee Ali Akbar Mohammadzadeh issued the warning last week as photographs of players with women were uploaded to social media.

Female supporters are banned from attending men's sports events in the Islamic republic but not in Australia, where Iran are playing in the Asian Cup.

Iran have had good support in Australia for the Asian Cup but their players have been warned recently

Mohamedzade, quoted by Iran's Shahrvand newspaper, said: 'National team players should be aware that they won't be used as a political tool so that those who take pictures with them don't use these photos against the players.

'So according to this they should not take photos with everyone. If the players don't respect this, we will be obliged to take action.'

There have not been any details on what the punishment would be, and the IFF were contacted by Sportsmail for comment.

Iran manager Carlos Queiroz avoided controversy by offering 'no comment' when asked about how women are banned from men's sports events on moral grounds.

One female fan tweeted pictures of goalkeeper Alireza Haghighi and midfielder Karim Ansarifard posing with women.

While another shows a woman holding an Iranian flag with a marriage proposal to Haghighi written on the front: 'Will Alireza marry me?'
