A decorated RAF Chinook pilot sexually assaulted a woman in bed after a Christmas party, a court heard today.

Squadron Leader Kai Mcnaughton, 42, who has completed seven tours of duty in Afghanistan, went into the woman’s bedroom as his wife and her husband were downstairs at the party, Winchester Crown Court heard.

The jury were told he put his hand under the covers to touch her intimately before she performed a sex act on him - wrongly believing it was her husband.

When the alleged victim, aged in her 40s, realised it was not her partner who had been in the room she punched the Squadron Leader.

The woman and her husband packed up and later called the police.

The alleged victim told the court today she did not consent to the man's advances and denied she had flirted with him during the evening.

Fearing his wife Claire would kick him out, Mcnaughton initially told her and the police that he had gone into the room but had only performed a sex act on himself.

Only later did he confess that he touched the woman - and he said she had touched him voluntarily, the court heard.

Mcnaughton, who has been in the RAF for 20 years and has been mentioned in dispatches for his service, said he thought she was awake and had consented to the activity because they had two 'drunken snogs' earlier.

The court was told that Mcnaughton, who is based at RAF Odiham in Hampshire, has now separated from his wife.

He told the jury he had danced and been flirting with the woman at the party in December 2010.

'I said she looked great, she had lost some weight. I said she looked hot, those were my words, and she liked them, smiled and carried on dancing,' he told the jury.

He said the woman kissed him 'all over his face' while their partners were in the room.

The two then decided to leave their other halves downstairs and go to separate bedrooms to sleep, Mcnaughton said.

He told the jury that he went into the woman's room to hand her a glass of water.

Mcnaughton
said: 'I went to give her a goodnight kiss and a long hug turned into a
long kiss. Not open-mouthed - a drunken snog is what I would call it.

Accused: Squadron Leader Kai Mcnaughton, who is on trial at Winchester Crown Court, claims the victim consented to his advances and denies any wrongdoing

'I asked her if she wanted a back massage. She said, "No, we’d better not". I read from that she didn’t want to do anything on that occasion in terms of a back massage.

'She gave me a gentle prod good-naturedly.

'I was very pleased. I felt she was attracted to me sexually. I was thinking we could potentially have an affair with each other. I felt it was something we could take further. I was unhappy in my marriage.'

However, he told the jury he later went back to the room as he went to investigate 'noises' he heard in the house.

He told the jury: 'I felt we could continue our drunken dalliance and I moved towards her bed. I could hear them talking downstairs.'

He touched the woman inappropriately before leaving the room and returning a third time.

Mcnaughton added: 'I intended to talk to her and to find out whether we could take our dalliance further.

'She went absolutely mental. She started screaming and shouting at me. I was stunned. I was absolutely in shock. She said "You f*****, you bastard. You were on top of me".'

He went on: 'I’m a decent person. I wouldn’t go into someone’s room. I was speechless. I could not believe why she was being like this. I backed out of the room immediately. I was in complete shock.'

His wife and the woman’s husband came straight up and the woman punched Mcnaughton, he told the jury, and then tried to kick him - forcing her husband to restrain her.

'She was being violent and aggressive to me, shouting and screaming,' he told the court.

Mcnaughton denies sexual assault and causing the woman to engage in sexual activity without consent.

The case continues.
