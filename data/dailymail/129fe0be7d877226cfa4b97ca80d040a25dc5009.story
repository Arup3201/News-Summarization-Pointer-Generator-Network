Louis van Gaal has moved in for 16-year-old Ajax defender Timothy Fosu Mensah.

The highly-rated Dutch prospect was at United’s Carrington training ground on Thursday ahead of a move which will cost an initial £300,000 in compensation.

United scouts were impressed by Fosu Mensah during Ajax’s AEGON Future Cup tournament win in April.

Transfer: Manchester United are close to a deal for 16-year-old defender Timothy Fosu Mensah

Manchester City and Inter Milan have also expressed an interest but him, who can play in a range of defensive positions, has opted for United.

Mensah is comfortable at centre-half but can also play at left-back and in defensive midfield, that versatility essential to Louis van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation.

He is physically imposing, but also comfortable on the ball, with pace a major asset - particularly in a left-wing back role. 

Interest: The Ajax and Dutch youth international also attracted interest from Manchester City and Inter Milan

United have already spent well over £100million this summer and, were he to join, Fosu Mensah would be the third left back to move to the club after Luke Shaw and Marcus Rojo.

Van Gaal's side travel to Turf Moor to face Burnley on Saturday, and record singing Angel di Maria could come straight in to the starting line-up.

 The Argentina winger signed for a British transfer record fee of £60m from Real Madrid.
