A member of one of Britain’s grandest aristocratic families appeared in court yesterday accused of beating up his wife.

Edward Alexander Somerset, a son of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, denied six charges of assaulting his wife of 30 years.

The 55-year-old wore a silver earring and looked gaunt and scruffy in black jeans, a navy blazer and a stained tie as he arrived at Bristol Crown Court.

Court appearance: Lord Somerset, seen left outside Bristol Crown Court today, denied six counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against his wife Lady Caroline Somerset, seen right in 2006

He and his wife, Lady Caroline, live 
on the 52,000-acre Badminton Estate, which is owned by Lord Edward’s 
father and is home to the Badminton Horse Trials.

Yesterday Lord Edward pleaded not 
guilty to six counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against 
Lady Caroline, 54. His trial is expected to begin in December.

Lord Somerset was told his trial was expected to take place in early December during a preliminary hearing at Bristol Crown Court.

The father-of-two looked at the floor for much of the hearing but spoke clearly and loudly to deny all charges.

The peer, a nephew of the eccentric Lord Bath, lives on a 17th century estate, home to the world-famous Badminton Horse Trials.

Aristocrat: Millfield-educated Lord Somerset, 55, is a son of the Duke of Beaufort and a nephew of Lord Bath

Allegations: The couple, who live on the 52,000 acre Badminton estate in Gloucestershire, have been married for 30 years

Millfield-educated Lord Somerset, who has been married for 30 years, previously attended North Avon Magistrates Court in connection with the charges.

It is thought several members of the aristocracy as well as staff from Badminton will be called as witnesses during the two week long trial.

Lord Somerset and his wife live in Grade II-listed Essex House, dating from the early 18th Century, which stands at the village entrance to the Badminton estate.

He is the third of four children of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, 85 year-old David Somerset, who is estimated to be worth £135million.

His eldest brother Henry John Fitzroy, Marquess of Worcester, 60, is heir to the estate and title.

His father remarried in 2000 after the death of his first wife and has been described by Tatler as one of 'the people who really matter'.

Trial: Lord Somerset is seen with his wife Lady Caroline Somerset attending a fancy dress party in 1993

They said the duke was an 'incredibly dashing' man who 'utterly worships his children'.

The duke is listed 590th in the latest Sunday Times Rich List, which notes he stands to make £180,000 a year from a planned wind farm near Swansea.

Judge Michael Longman adjourned the case and told Lord Somerset he will remain on unconditional bail until his next hearing - a plea and case management hearing on July 17.
