For Downton Abbey die-hards, submerging yourself in Julian Fellowes' world of lords, ladies and servants quarters must sound like a dream.

And now it will be possible to emulate the make-up of The Dowager Countess of Grantham, and even smell like Lord Grantham, thanks to a new line of Downton Abbey-themed beauty products being launched by Marks & Spencer to celebrate the fourth series, to be screened on ITV in October.

The phenomenally successful period 
drama set in the aristocratic world of a post-Edwardian Yorkshire estate has seduced the nation

The Downton Abbey Fragranced Candle (£8.50) and the three-shade Lip Gloss collection (£9.50)

The Downton products will allow people to emulate the look, and even the smell, of their favorite characters

Its heady combination of family and 
class 
narratives have provided a window into the world of luxury and glamour 
upstairs, and the drudgery taking place downstairs. It has even been 
successfully exported to the US.

M&S hope that the 10-piece gift collection, which includes soaps, a scented candle, lipstick, crème bath and nail varnishes - will appeal to the thousands of fans who want to emulate the world of Lord and Lady Grantham and the Crawleys.

The costumes and makeup of the Downton ladies like Lady Edith (left) and Mary (right) have become popular again, as women want to recreate the elegance of the period

Downton's steamy plot lines have kept its legions of fans hooked for three seasons, and anticipation is high for the fourth

And the products would not be out of place on Lady Mary's dresser or in a guest bathroom in the Abbey.

While the world of Downton may be becoming more obtainable, the reality unfortunately never will.

Downton Abbey itself is fictional, with Highclere Castle in Hampshire being used for the exterior building shots.

Although you can visit this ancient building, you will find it looks very different from the Crawley family home inside.

Most of the 'rooms' used for interior filming were constructed and filmed at Ealing Studios.

Each bearing the Downton Arms, the packaging features delicate floral designs in
rich tones of gold, emerald and burgundy, capturing the ornate Downton 
Abbey look and the classic elegance and charm of the Edwardian era.

They also each feature an iconic image of 
the Abbey and a quote from the series, such as 'I'd expect no less' on the Downton Abbey Guest 
Soaps.

There
is even a Downton Abbey cosmetic bag in the range, so you can hide 
any historically incorrect items of your own out of sight.

The
products themselves, however, are probably less historically accurate: 
we doubt Lady Mary and Edith spent their evenings painting their nails.

The products will be available at 250
M&S stores across the nation and cost from £5 for the lip balm set -
£49.50 for the luxury collection set.

The maker of Downton NBC Universal 
has signed a two-year merchandising deal with M&S, so we will likely
see more Grantham based products on the shelves.

Downton egg and cress sandwiches, anyone?

'I'd expect no less': Downton Abbey Signature Soaps (£6)

'No one wants to kiss a girl in black': Downton Abbey Lip Balm Duo (£5)
