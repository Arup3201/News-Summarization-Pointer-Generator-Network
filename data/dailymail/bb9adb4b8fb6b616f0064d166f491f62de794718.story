Two rhino poachers have been shot dead at an Indian wildlife sanctuary.

The men were caught after Indian Forest rangers heard them trying to shoot the animals in Kaziranga National Park in Assam, Northeastern India.

The pair were killed after a gun fight between the poachers and forest rangers.

Officials said that four poachers had entered the park had shot at a rhino.

Targets: Forest guards examining a dead rhino killed by poachers at the famous Kaziranga National Park. Poachers killed 21 rhinos in the park last year

Epidemic: Poachers killed a rhino and took away the horn at Burhapahar Range in Kaziranga National Park on January 28

Problem: Last week forest rangers engaged in a gun battle with poachers for more than seven hours, but they failed to prevent the killing of another rhino whose valuable horn was gouged out

India's location and array of wildlife makes it particularly susceptible to poachers who can easily export the goods.

The horns are than usually smuggled to neighboring China, where it is used as medicine and jewellery.

Poachers killed 21 rhinos in Kaziranga National Park last year.

An estimated 2,500 out of the world's 3,000 one-horned rhinos live in Kaziranga.

Last week forest rangers engaged in a gun battle with poachers for more than seven hours, but they failed to prevent the killing of another rhino whose valuable horn was gouged out.

An operation is currently ongoing in the nearby Karbi Anglong hills, in which several poachers have been arrested. The poachers are thought to have links with traders in Nagaland and Burma.
