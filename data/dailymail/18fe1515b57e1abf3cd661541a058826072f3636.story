The knives were out for Ed Balls last night as Labour MPs denounced his performance as one of the worst they have seen in the Commons.

Red-faced and shouting, the Shadow Chancellor faced mockery as he refused to acknowledge rising growth and continued to insist that he was right to oppose austerity all along.

Labour MPs last night questioned whether their party’s focus on the cost of living was enough to win them the election without a better economic message.

Watch the disaster below...

Lampooned: Ed Balls was ribbed online after his speech which led to his name trending on Twitter and people using #RedEd

Having fun: The Chancellor and the Prime Minister laughed heartily during  Ed Balls' speech today

One accused Mr Balls of having ‘f***** up’ Labour’s economic policy with his refusal to change course despite signs that the economy is improving.

Others questioned whether he should be sacked if Labour are to convince voters they can be trusted with the economy.

Mr Balls was greeted with a roar of derision from across the House when he claimed that it was the Chancellor who was ‘in complete denial’ about the state of the economy.

Mr Osborne hit back, saying: ‘The man who said that borrowing wouldn’t come down, unemployment wouldn’t come down, growth wouldn’t happen and the man who refuses to apologise for what he did to the British economy – he is the very epitome of denial.’

The Chancellor branded Mr Balls’s speech ‘a turkey’ and mercilessly ribbed him over his decision to cancel a grade three piano exam because it clashed with the Autumn Statement.

‘He probably should have gone ahead with his Chopsticks routine,’ Mr Osborne said.

Hard time: Ed Balls turned red and was forced to yell as he struggled to get his message across in the Commons today

Labour leader Ed Miliband grimaced as Mr Balls yelled himself hoarse, while Labour MPs sat mute and grim-faced behind him.

A senior Labour source admitted the party’s case on the economy ‘was not made well in the chamber today’.

One Labour MP went further, saying: ‘He f***** it up. I was watching it thinking “we are f*****”.

‘He’s supposed to be a bright bloke, but there was no analysis of the Autumn Statement in what he said. Ed Miliband should really have sacked him in the last reshuffle. It was a sign of weak leadership that he didn’t.’

Doubts about Mr Balls came as it emerged that former Labour Cabinet Minister Baroness Armstrong has privately said the approach of Mr Balls and Mr Miliband will leave the party ‘in deep shtook’.

Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow calls for order as Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls responds to the Autumn Statement

BAt a meeting of the Blairite Progress movement she said Labour were seen ‘as we were . . . in the late 80s’, adding: ‘Our hearts . .. are in the right place, but actually we’re not sufficiently concerned about public spending, about how we would pay for what we talk about’. 

Who do you trust most with the economy?

‘Unless we take that more seriously, 
we’re going to be in deep shtook. We are allowing the story about the 
economy . . . to be dominating and running in a way we can’t control.’

She admitted the Tories had ‘succeeded on the economy’.

Another 
Labour insider said Mr Balls would keep his job but should change 
course.

‘That is two quite shocking performances that he has turned in 
in his last two big appearances,’ the source said. ‘But what is 
concerning people is not just the performance.‘There are lots of 
people in the Shadow Cabinet saying that the cost of living stuff is 
fine – but it’s not enough. It’s probably too late to move him now but 
today was a reality check.’

One Blairite said MPs were likely to 
demand a rethink of Labour’s economic policies in the coming days. ‘I’ll
 be amazed if you don’t see the New Labour elements start to say that we
 need something more than cost of living issues.’

Mr Balls tried to 
put a brave face on his performance. He said: ‘I’ve got a bit of a sore 
throat. It was very, very loud. There are a lot of working people in 
this country who are seeing their living standards falling and no one to
 speak for them. I’m not going to allow 300 Tory MPs to shout me down.’

Flat: MPs behind Mr Balls looked less than enthused by his speech and a source later said George Osborne later quoted a Labour source as saying their case for the economy 'was not made well in the chamber today'

On the up: In March the Office for Budget Responsibility slashed growth forecast for this year to just 0.6 per cent, but the figure for 2013 and 2014 were dramatically upgraded today

Since
 the Coalition was formed in May 2010. Ed Balls has been George 
Osborne's sternest critic. Increasingly his words have come back to 
haunt him.

Here the Mail highlights some of his predictions - contrasting them with what actually happened.

DOUBLE DIP RECESSION:
 ‘Our complacent and out-of-touch Prime Minister and Chancellor have 
spent the last week claiming their plan is on track, but . . . Britain’s
 double-dip recession is even deeper than first thought. What more 
evidence can David Cameron and George Osborne need that their policies 
have failed and they now need a change of course and a Plan B for growth
 and jobs. – May 24, 2012.

Reality: A double dip was averted because growth was stronger than predicted.

CUTS WOULD CHOKE THE RECOVERY:
 ‘The overall impact is . . . a government plan which  isn’t balanced, 
which is a drag  on growth, which has focused  on recovery in my view. I
 have been saying for three years  that this plan wouldn’t work.’ –  May
 22, 2013.

Reality: During the very quarter that he was speaking, the economy was growing by 0.7 per cent.

UNEMPLOYMENT: ‘They have a programme that will clearly lead to the disappearance of a million jobs.’ – October 25, 2010.

Reality: Employment has increased by more than 1.1million since 2010.

PRIVATE SECTOR WOULD NOT CREATE JOBS
 ‘We were also told the public sector job cuts would  be more than 
outweighed by the rise in private sector jobs . . . It has been a 
complete disaster.’ – October 12, 2011.

Reality: Three jobs have been created in the private sector for every public sector job lost.

CRIME WOULD SOAR BECAUSE OF CUTS:
 ‘By failing to protect funding for the police in the Spending Review, 
the Home Secretary is taking huge risks with the public’s safety, crime 
and national security.’ – October 21, 2010.

Reality: Crime has fallen by more than 10 per cent.

CUTS TO COUNCILS WOULD HIT SERVICES: ‘We know the true impact of the massive frontloaded cuts to local government – hitting services.’ – June 6, 2011.

Reality: Public satisfaction with councils’ services have increased.
