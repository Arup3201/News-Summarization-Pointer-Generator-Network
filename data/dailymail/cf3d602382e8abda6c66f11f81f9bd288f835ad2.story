Bayern Munich's Mario Gotze gives a dramatic address  in the  trailer for PES 2015 ahead of the game's worldwide release on November 13.

Germany's World Cup-winning goalscorer stars on the cover of 14th edition of Pro Evolution Soccer, with his intense voiceover coming as his CGI likeness carves up opponents in the game.

The game is Konami's competition for EA Sports' epic FIFA franchise, which unleashed FIFA 15 in September with Lionel Messi as its main cover star.

'After all the sound and fury, only one place matters,' Gotze opens the promo. 

'Every passage of play, every match, every touch, is unique. For us there is no other sport. This is where we come to worship, to live.

'You can keep the easy goal, we are striving for the perfect one... We are the new era, the next generation, and we will do our job where it counts.'

Konami claims the new version has vastly improved real-time animation along with more players who share the same characteristics as the real life players they're modelled on.

The likeness is enhanced from running styles to their reaction to a referee's decision, and the player's frame of mind will have an impact on their quality of performance. 

Pro Evolution Soccer 2015, known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2015 in Asia, will be available for PS4, PS3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Microsoft Windows.
