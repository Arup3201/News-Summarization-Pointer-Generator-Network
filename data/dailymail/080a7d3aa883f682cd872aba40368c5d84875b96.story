New York Fashion Week has brought in more revenue for the city than last year's Super Bowl.

New research has found that the two Fashion Weeks held in September and February generate nearly $900 million for the city, while the 2014 Super Bowl, which was held in neighboring East Rutherford, New Jersey, only brought in $500 million. 

'The economic impact of New York's Fashion Weeks is massive!' New York Representative Carolyn Maloney said in a press release for her new financial report on the industry. 

Money maker: Naomi Campbell and Kendall Jenner lead models down the runway at Diane von Furstenberg's spring 2015 show. New York Fashion Week brings in nearly $900 million for the city according to a new report

Massive show: Last year's Super Bowl was held at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey and generated $500 million for New York City 

The research conducted by Mrs Maloney and the US Congress Joint Economic Committee shows that Fashion Week is the city's leading money-making event with more than 230,000 people attending the shows. 

That number jumps to more than 500,000 when combined with industry trade shows and showroom visits.   

New findings: New York Representative Carolyn Maloney unveiled her report on the economic impact of the fashion industry last Friday 

New York Fashion Week has a $887 million economic impact on the city, including the $547 million that comes directly from visitor spending.

Comparably, the US Tennis Open brings in $700 million over the course of two weeks, while the New York City Marathon generates $340 million. 

According to the research, New York Fashion Week has even 'eclipsed' the fashion weeks held in London, Paris and Milan.

Mrs Maloney unveiled the report last Friday at a press conference held at the Fashion Institute of Technology.

'It really astounded me,' she told WWD of her findings. 'As my first report as the ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, I wanted to do it on fashion, and what I found out blew me away.'

Mrs Maloney admitted that she didn't 'realize the importance of the fashion industry to our country and New York City' until she started working on the report.  

'More broadly, the fashion industry is an important segment of the city's economy, employing over 180,000 people, including 16,000 manufacturing jobs, paying $11 billion in wages and generating almost $2 billion in tax revenue each year,' she said.

Her research has also found that New York City's fashion industry is bringing back jobs that were once shipped overseas.

Mrs Maloney added: 'I hope this new report helps reawaken lawmakers and policy makers to understand and appreciate the huge financial impact of the fashion industry.'
