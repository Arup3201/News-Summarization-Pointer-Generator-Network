Banned: Footballer Craig Bellamy, pictured here competeing for the Team GB side at last summer's London Olympics, was banned from driving today after being caught speeding

Former Wales football captain Craig Bellamy was banned from driving and fined today after he was caught speeding on the motorway.

Cardiff City forward Bellamy was disqualified for six months and ordered to pay a £900 fine plus £400 costs for travelling at 64mph in a 50mph limit section of the M62 going into Liverpool in April last year.

The court heard Bellamy, who was not present at Liverpool Magistrates Court for the hearing, failed to respond to a police notice of intended prosecution.

Simon Leong, prosecuting, said the former Manchester City and Newcastle United star was playing for Liverpool FC at the time of the offence.

He was driving an Audi Q7 at the time.

Bellamy, 33, was charged with failing to give a driver's identity as required under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act.

He initially pleaded not guilty and a trial was set for November 27 last year but that had to be abandoned for medical reasons.

The footballer, of Brides-Super-Ely, Cardiff, changed his plea to guilty on December 18, the day his rescheduled trial was due to take place, and the matter was adjourned until today's sentencing.

Mr Leong said Bellamy had totted up nine penalty points for three previous speeding offences.

'This offence carries six points taking him over the threshold for disqualification,' he added.

John Rowan, defending, told the court the star initially denied the offence because the notice was sent to an address where he was not living at the time.

He said: 'A plea of guilty was substituted in relation to that and he did accept that perhaps he could have done more to intercept the notice and ensure that the details were completed.

Mr Rowan told the court he was not provided with information about the defendant's income but added: 'I should point out that Mr Bellamy is a former Premiership footballer. He is not currently playing in the Premier League but he is a professional footballer.'

Deputy District Judge Simmons gave Bellamy credit of 10 per cent for his guilty plea, ordering a fine of £900 plus £400 costs and £15 victim surcharge which he must pay within 14 days.
