'We decided to be open with the people of NSW and in that we exposed ourselves to a big scare campaign,' he said.

'I want to thank Luke Foley for his concession. He has been a tough opponent, and I appreciate his gracious words tonight.' 

The Premier also thanked the support he received from Tony Abbott and the federal Liberal party.

Labor leader Luke Foley called the Premier to concede defeat shortly after 9pm.

'We decided to be open with the people of NSW and in that we exposed ourselves to a big scare campaign,' he said in his victory speech

In his concession speech, Mr Foley was positive about his party's performance, and celebrated its recovery from the last election.

'We've received half-a-million more votes today than we did at the last election,' he said. 

'After tonight we now have a two party system again in New South Wales.

'The next election, friends, is now winnable for Labor.'

As voters across New South Wales went to the polls today, more than 230,000 skipped out on the sausage sizzles and instead cast their vote online.

The total number of online votes have not been counted yet, but it is a dramatic increase on the 50,000 in the 2011 state election.

The NSW Electoral Commission said it was pleased with the online voting system, according to the AAP.

'It's been extremely popular and working well,' a NSW Electoral Commission spokesman told AAP around midday on Saturday.

But not just anyone can use the remote electronic voting system known as iVote.

Under current legislation, there are restrictions.

'It's (for) people who are overseas, or are blind or disabled, or live a long way from a polling place,' the spokesman said.

'But if the politicians want to change the legislation to allow (everyone to use it) then obviously it's something that in the future could become even more popular.

'The public seems to be very, very positive about it.' 

Sydney teacher Curtis Jobe took advantage of online voting, posting to his Facebook page about his long-distance role in the democratic process.

'Just voted in the NSW State Election... From my phone... In my bed... In Sri Lanka. Can someone bring me a sausage sizzle?' he said. 

All 93 seats in the lower house of parliament were up for grabs with 47 seats needed to gain power.

Half of the NSW upper house, 21 seats, is also up for election.

Federal MPs were out in force across NSW on Saturday, in an effort to give their respective party colleagues a boost at the booths.

Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, who holds the inner-east federal seat of Wentworth, teamed up with Prime Minister Tony Abbott's sister, Christine Forster, to support Bruce Notley-Smith in Coogee.

Labor's Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong headed to Stanmore Public School to support Penny Sharpe. 

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop celebrated Mr Baird's win in Sydney last night, and said the result showed that Australian voters are prepared to come together and embrace reform.

'This is an outstanding win,' Ms Bishop said.

'Not only for the people of New South Wales, but for Australia.'

Tony Abbott and Bill Shorten were both absent from New South Wales on the final day of the election race

However, both federal leaders, Tony Abbott and Bill Shorten, steered clear of the state on Saturday. 

Candidates to be Premier attempted to court voters online throughout the campaign, with social media becoming a crucial battleground for the candidates.

Mr Baird attempted to get in on the 'Mean tweets' gimmick, filming his own version of the popular schtick. Not to be outdone, NSW Labor took shots at the Premier with one of the internet's most tried and true trends, LOL cat memes.
