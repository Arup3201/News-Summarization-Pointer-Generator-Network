Facebook's stock has fallen below $30 for the first time since its much-awaited public debut this month.

The stock continued its noted decrease, finishing the day on Tuesday at $28.84.

The public launch of Facebook Inc. began
trading publicly on May 18, just one day before the company's founder 
Mark Zuckerberg wed his longtime girlfriend Priscilla Chan, was one of 
the most anticipated stock offerings in history.

In spite of the troubles on the market, Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Chan went ahead with their honeymoon plans and are on holiday in Italy at present.

The couple met while both students at Harvard University, which is when Mr Zuckerberg launched the program out of his dorm room.

In the past eight years, the site has grown into a worldwide network of almost a billion people, was supposed to offer proof that social media is a viable business and more than a passing fad.

Facebook's initial public offering of stock priced at $38 and raised $16billion for Facebook and some of its early investors.

It had valued the company at $104billion - more than Amazon.com Inc., at $98billion, at the time.

The couple have travelled to the picturesque part of Southern Italy - a part of the country so beautiful it has been declared a World Heritage Site - from Rome, where they have spent the past few days sight-seeing.

Yesterday the newlyweds were spotted brushing up on some Italian architecture as they toured the Sistine Chapel.

A fellow tourist snapped the Facebook CEO as he wandered around the chapel in the Vatican with a priest and tour guide, occasionally placing an affectionate hand on his new bride's back.

Zuckerberg and his wife listened intently to a guide explaining the marvels of the stunning 500-year-old paintings that adorn the walls and ceilings.

Eschewing glitzy restaurants and stiff luxury dining, the two opted for a meal at a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Rome's Jewish Ghetto where they enjoyed a simple Italian meal of fried pumpkin flowers and ravioli in an artichoke sauce.

Their bill, which was immediately posted online, revealed that the two sipped tea and water, and paid just 32 euros for their feast - a mere drop in the ocean of Zuckerberg's fortune.

But the stock's public debut was marred by technical glitches at the Nasdaq Stock Market that delayed trading.

And the company, along with the investment banks that led the IPO, is the subject of at least two shareholder lawsuits.

They
allege that analysts at the large underwriting investment banks cut 
their second-quarter and full-year forecasts for Facebook just before 
the IPO and told only a handful of clients.

Amid a flurry of lawsuits over 
Facebook's IPO, Morgan Stanley announced in a memo on Wednesday that it 
is reviewing Facebook trades and would adjust prices for some retail 
customers who overpaid.

The IPO mishaps have sparked numerous
lawsuits against Morgan Stanley, the Nasdaq stock exchange and Facebook
itself by shareholders who claimed they hid the social networking 
company's weakened growth forecasts just before it went public.

The allegations raised questions about whether top investors profited at the expense of smaller buyers.

The insider spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Facebook's much-anticipated IPO was delayed by a half-hour on Friday because of technical glitches on the Nasdaq.

After pricing at $38, Facebook's stock initially closed up 23 cents on Friday and has been down since. 

In a sign of how feeling is changing 
against Facebook, some commentators have begun comparing its activities 
to the most reckless behaviour of Wall Street banks.

They have also coined the word ‘Zucked’, which means to get shafted on the sale of Facebook shares.

These
major sell-offs comes as new allegations are emerging the the 
over-hyped Facebook stock sale may have been rigged against small, 
every-day buyers.

Two 
separates lawsuits have been filed against the company and the banks 
that organized the IPO, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, alleging the 
executives knew second-quarter revenue would not meet expectations as 
Facebook's growth slows.

With the latest drop, Facebook's value is about $80 billion.
