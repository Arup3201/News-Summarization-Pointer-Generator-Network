Mother-of-two Samantha Jennings who died in the car crash

A man who killed his girlfriend when he crashed his car after smoking cannabis walked free from court after the victim’s mother begged a judge to spare him prison.

Samantha Jennings, 26, died when Thomas Whitehouse, 23, lost control of his Vauxhall Astra and ploughed into a stone wall and then a tree.

The mother-of-two, who was sat in the front passenger seat, died at the scene after the collision on the A449 in Cookley, Worcestershire, on December 8 last year.

Mr Whitehouse also suffered horrific injuries in the crash had to have a leg amputated.

Police tests after the accident found no alcohol in Mr Whitehouse’s blood but they did detect traces of cannabis.

He admitted causing death by careless driving and possession of a Class B drug at a previous court hearing.

But on Friday, Mr Whitehouse, from Stourbridge, West Mids, was spared jail after Samantha’s mum Deborah asked for him to be shown mercy.

He was instead given a four-month prison term suspended for 12 months at Worcester Crown Court.Judge Patrick Thomas QC agreed with the defence that a custodial sentence shouldn’t be imposed immediately due to what he described as 'powerful personal mitigation'.

In a moving sign of forgiveness, Miss Jennings' mother Deborah sat alongside Mr Whitehouse’s family in court and asked for him not to be sent to jail.

Prosecutor Paul Whitfield said: 'The victim’s mother wishes that he be spared prison.'

Defending Gurdeep Garcha added: 'It speaks volumes of Mrs Jennings that she has remained in contact with Mr Whitehouse’s family throughout this ordeal.

'She sits next to Mrs Whitehouse.'

On the night of the crash Whitehouse and his girlfriend Samantha had driven back from Birmingham and picked up two pals, including Leander Mock.

At the inquest into Samantha’s death at Worcestershire Coroners Court in April, Mr Mock said he felt a bump before the car started to skid and it felt like the rear tyres had left the road.

He added: 'I only saw Tom have one drink all evening and we were going at a reasonable speed not going above the limit.'

The inquest also heard that none of the car passengers were wearing seat-belts at the time of the crash.Samantha, who was from Wordsley, West Midlands, left behind two boys aged eight and nine and worked as a care assistant looking after adults with disabilities.

In a tribute after her death, her family said: 'Sam was a caring person, an angel.

'She was a much loved mother, daughter, sister, and granddaughter, and we are broken-hearted.

'Sam was vivacious, a party girl, who lived life to the full. She had the world at her feet, and was so happy.

'She leaves us the legacy of her two little boys and she will be forever in our thoughts and in our hearts.'
