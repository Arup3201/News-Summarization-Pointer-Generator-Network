A Thai airport has been brought to a temporary standstill after one of its jets skidded off the runway as it prepared to take off.

The Thai Airways plane was scheduled to depart the country’s Khon Kaen airport for Bangkok at 8pm on Monday.

The crew were attempting a U-turn on the runway when the aircraft left the tarmac, causing its nose wheel to plough into the soft ground.

None of the 248 passengers or 14 crew onboard suffered any injuries, and were taken off the aircraft via air stairs.

Khon Kaen’s single runway has no taxiways.

This requires departing aircraft to taxi to the runway’s end before turning around ahead of take-off.

The incident brought an immediate halt to the airport’s operations while recovery crews at Khon Kaen airport began digging out the Airbus A330-300 this morning.

Officials from Thai Airways, Air Asia, and Nok Air are escorted passengers who planned to depart from Khon Kaen airport to buses to board their flights at Udon Thani Airport instead.

It is expected that operations at Khon Kaen airport will resume later today.

The incident is the latest to have affected Thai Airways, which is battling fincancial losses said to have been caused by a drop in tourism to Thailand in recent years

The incident is the latest to have affected Thai Airways, which is said to have suffered from a drop in tourism to Thailand in recent years.

The company reported a net loss of THB7.7 billion (£150,000) in the second quarter of this year – a decline which has been blamed on a lack of confidence in Thailand as a tourist destination because of political unrest.

The airline recently cancelled flights to its only remaining Africa destination, Johannesburg. The airline will now stop its three weekly flights to the city from January 2015.

Thai Airways president Siwakiat Jayema has called for wide-ranging cuts to be made at the airline and suggested that more than 6,000 jobs at the flag carrier could be go over the next four years.

Thailand’s much prized tourist industry is in decay following more than 12 months of political unrest, a subsequent military coup and the murder of two British backpackers in mid-September

Siwakiat is the third president that Thai Airways has seen in a little over six months. 

He took over from temporary president Chokchai Panyayong in July, who replaced previous incumbent Sorajak Kasemsuvan in January following the latter’s resignation in December last year. 

Thailand’s much prized tourist industry is in decay following more than 12 months of political unrest, which included military coup as well as the murder of two British backpackers in mid-September.

In the first nine months of 2014, there were more than two million fewer foreign tourists who visited Thailand compared with the same period a year previously.

From an initial forecast at the end of last year of 30.27 million foreign visitor arrivals Thailand’s Ministry of Tourism and Sports is now forecasting 25.5 million foreign visitors in 2015.
