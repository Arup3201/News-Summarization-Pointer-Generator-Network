Amba, one of the park's tigers

Easter egg hunters feared they had become the hunted after a ‘tiger escape’ alarm went off at a zoo.

Hundreds of people were ordered indoors as staff reacted to a ‘code red’ at Shepreth Wildlife Park in Cambridgeshire.

Lunches were left on picnic benches and an Easter egg hunt was abandoned as efforts were made to locate the most dangerous cats - two tigers and a puma.

But it soon became clear that it was a false alarm and around 500 adults and children were able to go back to enjoying their day out.

Curator Rebecca Willers said it became clear ‘within minutes’ that there was no risk to visitors on Saturday.

‘The “code red” alarm set off by a member of the public means there are tigers out there and the whole park had to be evacuated,’ she said.

‘They were either testing us to see how we would do or did it as a practical joke.

‘It was not done by accident. The button has a flap over it, so it was deliberate. But we did not catch the culprit.

‘It happened at the busiest point of the day, just after midday when we had started the Easter egg hunt.

‘We’ve had three alarms go off that weren’t drills, which is not too bad considering that’s since 2001.

‘We do drills four times a year but we weren’t scheduled to have one so all the staff treated it as if it was a real incident.

‘Everyone in the park had to go into buildings. I was really impressed with the staff.

‘The public did superbly, although a few didn’t want to leave their picnics.’ She later explained the three previous alarms were not for genuine escapes but the result of mistakes by visitors.

In one case an ‘apologetic and embarrassed’ parent admitted their young child had managed to push the button.

There are three emergency panic buttons in public areas at the eight-acre site.

Each has a large sign with red letters that says ‘Emergency use only. Use this button only in the event of seeing a tiger or puma out of its enclosure’.

The zoo’s three big cats - tigers Amba and Rana and a puma called Tige - as well as three Eurasian lynx and two Scottish wildcats.

There are also primates, a tropical house and a nocturnal house with free-flying bats.

The site was founded as an animal sanctuary in 1979 and opened to the public five years later.
