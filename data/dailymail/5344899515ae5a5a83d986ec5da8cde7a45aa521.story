Amidst a sea of tense faces fretting over Ryder Cup places and loss of form, Rory McIlroy was a veritable beacon of tranquility at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone on Thursday.

Earning a Claret Jug will do that for a man, as the 25-year-old threatened for most of his opening round to carry on from where he left off at Hoylake.

As it turned out, an ugly double bogey from nowhere on his penultimate hole, the eighth on the card, turned an opening 67 that would have fairly reflected his play into a 69 that still left him decently placed, as he seeks the victory he needs to climb over Adam Scott and become world No 1 again.

Open winner: Rory McIlroy was back in action at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and played some good golf

The leader at the end of the first day was another Aussie, Marc Leishman, who followed up his top five finish at The Open by shooting a 64. It gave him a one shot lead over American Ryan Moore and Charl Schwartzel from South Africa. Leading European was Scottish Open Champion Justin Rose, who shot 65.

An indication of how relaxed McIlroy was came at the 17th, where the ringtone of a mobile playing a garish country song went off loudly just yards from where he happened to be ready to strike his tee shot. Imagine the reaction of most players?

McIlroy never backed off, never blinked in fact. He just stuck to his routine and launched another howitzer on this uphill par four that came to earth fully 50 yards past the drive of his playing partner, Matt Kuchar.

‘I think I am driving the ball better than I ever have right now,’ said the 25 year old, and gave another prodigious demonstration at the 18th, where his tee shot on this 464-yard par four finished just 85 yards from the hole.

Tied third with two to play, the last thing expected was for McIlroy to thin a bunker shot and make a hash of his next blow as well, after his ball had finished against a collar of rough.

‘I said beforehand that I wanted to ride the momentum of my Open win and I thought I did that apart from the 8th,’ said McIlroy. ‘Other than that hole, I played pretty well.’

This is one of only two big events left to decide the automatic Ryder Cup places on both sides of the Atlantic and boy, can you tell. Welshman Jamie Donaldson, one of those sweating on a spot, summed it up nicely when he said: ’You want to forget about it but all the time you’ve got this voice at the back of your mind nagging away and reminding you what’s at stake.’

Lining it up: Victory would see the Northern Irishman become world No 1, climbing above Adam Scott

It would be desperately harsh if the 38 year old Welshman missed out on a Gleneagles debut now after being in the frame for virtually all the qualifying period but it could still happen, and particularly after missing the halfway cut at the Scottish Open and The Open. To that end, a two under par 68 that left him handily placed in the top ten was a gusty effort.

One shot nearer the lead held by American Ryan Moore and South African Charl Schwartzel following rounds of 65 was in-form Italian Frankie Molinari, currently 13th in the standings but who could leap into the automatic spots with a top two finish.

Luke Donald is presently clinging to the last automatic slot and left the door firmly ajar with his disappointing opening round of 73. Scot Stephen Gallacher, presently 10th in the standings, couldn’t take advantage, posting a 74. Lee Westwood, another who needs a big week, shot 72.

Good golf: McIlroy had a good round on the first day but he could not quite get the lead and is three behind
