The only bottle of Big Mac Special Sauce available to the public is up for grabs on eBay and is already sitting at $23,000 - and there is still another eight days of bidding to go.

The first produced of just 200 500ml bottles of the McDonald's signature burger sauce has sparked a massive interest from Aussie Macca's fans with 135 bids growing to $23,100 in just two days.

However with the auction running until February 11 - it begs the question: How much you would be prepared to spend to get your mitts on the much-loved condiment to take home and lather on any meal you fancy?

The McDonald's signature burger sauce has sparked a massive interest from Aussie Macca's fans with 135 bids growing to more than $23,100 in just two days and eight days of bidding still to go

Only one 500ml bottle of the Big Mac Special Sauce is being auctioned off on eBay with money going to charity

The very tongue-in-cheek ad on eBay talks about setting the sauce free which makes it 'rarer than a spot on Bondi beach on New Years Day.'

It goes on to say that any dish tastes better with the famous sauce including steak, your mum's lasagne, Chicken Caesar Salad and even Hungarian Goulash.

'Cupcakes, ice cream, macaroni jewellery, fish oil capsules. Don’t like brussel sprouts? You will now!' 

'With 500ml to play with, you’ll have enough to impress your friends at dinner parties, cheat your way to cooking show fame, and get elected as Prime Minister!'

If this all seems a bit too self-indulgent - 100 per cent of the sale goes to the Ronald McDonald House Charities.

There is no need to panic if you don't have thousands of dollars in cash to spare to splash out on a bottle of sauce - as Australians are privvy to 25ml tubs throughout the month of February.

But you will need to get in quick because each of the 920 Australian stores only have 600 25ml tubs on offer. 

Although the magic ingredients for the Big Mac sauce have never been a secret - it's the ratio to create distinct flavour that remains a mystery

Until now, the Big Mac sauce has only been delivered to McDonald’s outlets in sealed canisters and directly dispensed onto the burger using a specially calibrated ‘sauce gun’. 

Although the magic ingredients for the sauce have never been a secret - it's the ratio to create distinct flavour that remains a mystery.

The sauce is made up of a blend of relish, mustard, onion and garlic, along with other ingredients, which gives it that distinctive sweet and sour taste. 

'Big Mac sauce is one of the most iconic McDonald's ingredients and people often ask us where they can buy it; so we're excited to be the first country in the world to offer tubs of Big Mac sauce to our customers,' McDonald's Australia, Chief Marketing Officer Mark Lollback said.

'I know of people who love adding our special sauce to all types of food – from french fries to McNuggets – so it's going to be interesting to see what Aussies choose to add a spot of Big Mac sauce to over the next month.'

The ingredients that make up the Big Mac are the same today as when the burger was first created 40 years ago – two all beef patties, Special Sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun

Each 920 of the McDonald's stores throughout Australia have 600 25ml tubs available until sold out

The first chance Aussies will have to get their hands on some Big Mac sauce is through an eBay auction of an exclusive 500ml bottle that kicked off last night, with proceeds going to Ronald McDonald House Charities. 

The bottle is one of only 200 produced in the world with the remaining 199 not available for purchase. 

'We're excited to be auctioning off the first-ever bottle of Big Mac sauce for a cause we are passionate about,' Mr Lollback said. 

'It's going to be interesting to see just how much people are prepared to pay for such a sought after commodity.'

A vending machine tour is travelling to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane throughout February to give Aussies the chance to grab a free tub in return for a tweet.
