A fifth of patients turning up in A&E have self-treatable conditions including sore throats, athlete’s foot and head lice, a study has claimed.

Researchers have calculated that more than 4 million visits a year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290 million. 

Doctors have even reported patients showing up because they were hungover, their false nails were hurting or they had paint in their hair.

More than four million A&E visits each year are unnecessary – costing the NHS £290million, a survey claims

Doctors have even reported patients showing up because their children had headlice, or because their false nails were hurting 

The analysis of data from 15 A&E units by consultancy firm IMS Health found that 19 per cent of patients had what is called a ‘self-treatable condition’.

The data covered one in ten A&E units across England, so if the trends are mirrored across the country, then an estimated 4.1million of the 21.7million visits last year were for minor ailments. 

The problem is largely caused by the fact that patients find it difficult to see a GP, particularly out of hours.

Many go to A&E in the knowledge that they will at least be seen by a doctor that day, even if they have to wait four hours.

Even the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has admitted taking his children to casualty at the weekend rather than making an appointment with a GP.

But the unnecessary visits are adding to the pressures of busy departments and diverting staff from treating patients who are very seriously ill.

It all came to a head in January when 13 hospitals declared major internal incidents in a two-day period as they were unable to cope with the numbers coming through the door.

Now experts are urging patients to use local pharmacies, where they can be offered advice and treatment. 

Matthew Speers, from the Proprietary Association of Great Britain – which represents medicine manufacturers and commissioned the research – said: ‘Pharmacists are well placed to provide advice to people with minor conditions, ensuring they get support without diverting NHS resources from people who really need them.’

Figures show that 21.7 million patients attended A&E in 2013/14 - a rise of more than a third in a decade

But Dr Clifford Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors said attempts to divert patients did not work.

Dr Mann, an A&E consultant at Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton, Dorset, added that the ‘A&E brand is well-known and trusted’ so ‘patients will continue to attend.’

He said the only solution was to install GP clinics at A&E units so patients with minor ailments could be sent there leaving staff to deal with the more serious cases.

Figures show that 21.7 million patients attended A&E in 2013/14 - a rise of more than a third in a decade.

And the NHS has missed its target for ensuring 95 per cent of patients are dealt with within four hours every week for the last six months.

In November, Jeremy Hunt admitted in the Commons he had taken his own children to A&E ‘precisely because I didn’t want to wait until later on to take them to a GP.’

‘If parents have an unwell child who needs medical attention A&E provides a trusted service.’
