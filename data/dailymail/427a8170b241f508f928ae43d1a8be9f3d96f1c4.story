Prince William today called people involved in the illegal trade of rhino horn 'extremely ignorant, selfish and utterly wrong'.

Black rhinos are critically endangered in the wild because of the soaring price of rhino horn, which is worth more than gold due to demand in some countries.

Rhino horn is perceived to possess medicinal properties and in some Asian countries it is believed that it holds a cure for cancer and acts as an aphrodisiac.

The prince, who is royal patron of the charity Tusk Trust, is following in the footsteps of his environmental activist father Charles.

He was speaking at Port Lympne wildlife park in Kent earlier this month. Three rare black rhino born in captivity and raised there are this week being returned to the wild in Tanzania.

In an interview that aired on BBC Breakfast today he was asked what he thought of people who knew of the rhino’s plight but continued to poach or buy their horns.

The Duke of Cambridge replied: 'I think they are extremely ignorant. I think they are selfish. I think they are wrong, totally and utterly wrong.

'It makes me very angry, it’s a waste.'

Poaching has had a dramatic impact on all rhino populations in the wild and it is believed they could soon be extinct if they continue to be killed.

William said: 'Along with elephants, they're two of the most heavily poached animals currently in the world. If we don’t do something about them it is going to be a tragic loss for everyone.

'If we don't do something about them it's going to be a tragic loss for everyone.'

Asked about those who seek rhino horn, William said: 'My message to them is simply "Stop".

'It’s a message about educating people and understanding that when you buy that rhino horn, or when you buy that ivory, you are taking this from an animal that has been slaughtered for this decorative ornament you have on your mantelpiece and you have at home - is that really what you desire and what you feel is right in the world?'

William's passion for conservation is in line with his father's strong views on animal welfare and the environment.

Just yesterday, the Prince of Wales urged world leaders to adopt a better, more integrated approach to issues like climate change.

In a pre-recorded speech to a UN 
sustainability conference in Brazil, he warned of the potentially 
'catastrophic' consequences of inaction on issues such a climate change 
and global food security.

And, speaking in 2010, Charles said: ‘I am absolutely determined to be the defender of nature. Full stop. That’s what the rest of my life is going to be concerned with.'

Museums across Europe have recently 
been targeted by rhino horn thieves as populations of the animals 
diminish more and more in the wild.

The
horn is ground down for usage in many Chinese medicaments, most 
famously to make an alleged aphrodisiac which, scientists say, has no 
effect.

A single horn can capable of fetching close to £200,000 on the black market. China and Vietnam are the main markets.

In their natural habitats in Africa and Asia, fewer than 30,000 rhinoceroses still roam in the wild today.

Javan rhinos, with a population of just under 50, are under particular threat of extinction.
