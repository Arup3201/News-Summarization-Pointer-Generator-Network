Chelsea Clinton’s much-hyped debut as an NBC reporter last night was today slammed as 'monochromatic', 'nervous' and showing 'no charisma'.

The 31-year-old former first daughter chatted with Rock Center host Brian Williams on the NBC sofa and did a segment on a non-profit organisation.

Some reviewers gave her the benefit of the doubt for first-night nerves but one suggested she could be ‘one of the most boring people of her era’.

Boring: Chelsea Clinton's much-hyped debut as an NBC reporter last month was slammed as 'monochromatic', 'nervous' and showing 'no charisma'

Presenter: Her report was a feel-good piece from the Topps Center in the poverty-stricken Pine Bluff in Jefferson County, Arkansas

Dressed in a plain claret dress for 
the studio part, she was decidedly low key as she talked about the 
non-profit story and how she came to NBC.

She said: 'For most of my life, I did deliberately lead a private life and inadvertently led a public life.'

She credited her late grandmother, 
Dorothy Rodham, for convincing her to come out of the shadows and into 
the spotlight, reported Politico.

Miss Clinton said: 'She recently had 
been cajoling me and challenging me to do more with my life, to lead a 
more of purposely public life.

'Clinton... seems like a very nice young woman. She is obviously bright, although we already suspected she was that as well. Otherwise, there was nothing else that necessarily dismissed charges (mostly by TV critics, although they were not alone) that she got this job because of that name'(Verne Gay, Newsday)

'The former first daughter appeared poised and well-prepared, though a bit nervous'(Caitlin McDevitt, Politico)

'Chelsea doesn’t "pop" off the screen, to use an industry term - her demeanour is reserved, she doesn’t project her voice like a broadcaster. Not that most viewers probably cared'(Howard Kurtz, Daily Beast)

'What was surprising to see on Monday night’s show is how someone can be on TV in such a prominent way and, in her big moment, display so very little charisma - none at all. Either we’re spoiled by TV’s unlimited population of giant personalities or this woman is one of the most boring people of her era'(Hank Stuever, Washington Post)

Chat: Miss Clinton was filmed making cornbread and interviewing founder Annette Dove, left, about the 500 children and young adults they serve

Interviews: Sources say Chelsea's debut didn't go off as well as expected and she may not resign again

‘(She said) that being Chelsea Clinton
 had happened to me and that I had a responsibility to do something with
 that asset and opportunity.'

'For most of my life, I did deliberately lead a private life and inadvertently led a public life'

Chelsea Clinton

Her report was a feel-good piece from the Topps Center in the poverty-stricken Pine Bluff in Jefferson County, Arkansas.

Miss Clinton was filmed making 
cornbread and interviewing founder Annette Dove about the 500 children 
and young adults they serve. 

The report was part of the network's 
Making a Difference series. While her debut went smoothly it wasn't met 
with enthusiasm by many.

First show: Brian Williams interviewed Chelsea Clinton on Monday night's Rock Center as she made her debut as an NBC 'special correspondent'

Mixed reception: Some reviewers gave her the benefit of the doubt for first-night nerves but one suggested she is 'one of the most boring people of her era'

Hank Stuever, writing for the Washington Post, said she displayed 'so very little charisma - none at all.'

'Either
 we’re spoiled by TV’s unlimited population of giant personalities or 
this woman is one of the most boring people of her era'

Hank Stuever

He wrote: 'Either we’re spoiled by 
TV’s unlimited population of giant personalities or this woman is one of
 the most boring people of her era.'

He notes that after degrees 
from Stanford, Oxford and Columbia, she is now doing feel-good 
journalism - ‘one of the easiest tasks on the planet’.

Meanwhile
 Howard Kurtz of the Daily Beast said she had a 'reserved demeanour' and
 did not 'project her voice like a broadcaster'.
