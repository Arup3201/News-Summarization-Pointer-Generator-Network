David Moyes' Real Sociedad side saw off bottom club Cordoba 3-1 at the Anoeta Stadium on Sunday night, as the visitors had three men sent off in a fiery affair.  

Aleksandar Pantic was given his marching orders after just six minutes for the visitors, but this didn't stop Florin Adone from giving them a shock lead in the firs-half. 

Imanol Agierretxe equalised for Sociedad before the interval though and Chori Castro was able to make the most of the one-man advantage after the break to give the hosts a 2-1 lead. Inigo Lopez was then shown two yellow cards in quick succession, before substitute Alfred Finnbogason wrapped up the win with a late goal. Daniel Pinillos became the third Cordoba player to be sent off in injury time on a truly awful night for the club.
