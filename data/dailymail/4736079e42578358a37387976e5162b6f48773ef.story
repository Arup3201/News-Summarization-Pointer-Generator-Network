The owner of the hotel where a young woman was murdered in a reported act of cannibalism has spoken of the moment she walked in to find the blood-spattered killer leaning over and staring at his mutilated victim.

Mandy Miles, who owns the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in Argoed, south Wales, said she looked into Matthew Williams's 'black eyes' and would have attacked him with a fire extinguisher had Cerys Yemm, 22, still been alive.

Mrs Miles said she had gone up to the room because her son told her Williams, 34, had a woman in there, which is against the hotel's rules.

Mandy Miles outside the Sirhowy Arms Hotel where Cerys Yemm was brutally murdered and cannibalised last week has described the horrific moment she walked in on the killer and his mutilated victim

Loss: Cerys Yemm, 22, was killed and mutilated by Matthew Williams, 34, at the Argoed hotel

Little could she have imagined the sickening sight when she opened the door to confront him.

She said: 'The amount of blood and the stillness of her, there were no signs of life at that point.

'I said to Matthew "do you know what you're doing to that girl?"

His chilling reply? 'That's no girl.'

Mrs Miles, who is studying for a degree in criminology and psychology, said : 'He was leaning over her.

Miss Yemm, who worked in sales at Next, is believed to have met Williams through mutual friends

'Who in their right mind would just carry on leaning and looking down?

'With me walking in would make you stand up, it would make you lift your head. That told me he didn't know what he was doing.'

And she said that she was given no information about Williams by the authorities before he moved in.

Ms Yemm died in the hotel in Argoed, near Blackwood, last week. She had substantial injuries.

Williams also died at the scene after he was Tasered by police.

Mrs Miles said she saw broken china in the room and injuries to Miss Yemm's neck and jaw

Williams had taken a cocktail of mind-bending drugs and told friends he was hearing voices and hallucinating before attacking Miss Yemm and reportedly biting off parts of her face.

Miss Yemm, who worked in sales at Next, is believed to have met Williams through mutual friends. 

Mrs Miles said she saw broken china in the room and  injuries to Miss Yemm's neck and jaw.

'I had to decide what the hell was going on and then I had residents behind me in danger,' she added.

'I rang 999 and I made damn well sure he couldn't get out of that room. It was the fear of what he was capable of. He didn't recognise me and he didn't recognise what he was doing.

'I was holding onto the door knob so he couldn't get out. I couldn't let him flee the scene.

'The police then came upstairs and took over.

'If that girl had been alive, I couldn't have closed the door, I would've had to attack Matthew with the fire extinguisher.'

Mrs Miles added that Williams had told her he had been in prison for theft, rather than assaulting an ex-partner and has now called for more information to be shared between agencies so that she knows people's backgrounds before she accepts them as residents.  

'It's worrying, it's terrifying,' she added. 'I need to know who is walking through my door. Someone needs to give me a bit of a heads up and people's backgrounds.

'If they've come from prison, I think I personally should be told what's happened.'

Mrs Miles also said she plans to seal off the room as no one will ever want to stay there.

She added: 'I can never use that room again. Not for anything. I'm going to have the door removed, it'll be an open room. I wouldn't expect anyone to want to be in that room.'

A Home Office pathologist has carried out initial tests on the victim and have indicated the cause of Ms Yemm's death as headwounds.

But they are continuing to carry out a series of further tests on Cerys before an inquest is heard.

A Gwent police spokeswoman said: 'The initial post-mortem results for Cerys Yemm indicate that she died from head injuries.

'However it may take a number of weeks before the post-mortem is completed.'
