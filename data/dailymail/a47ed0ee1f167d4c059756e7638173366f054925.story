One of the theories for how life began on Earth is something known as panspermia.

This says that life was first carried to Earth in microbial form by an asteroid or comet that originated from a planet in our solar system such as Mars, or even one outside it.

But could the opposite be possible? Could we send our own life into the universe to ‘seed’ other worlds? That’s what some researchers have discussed - and they say it’s feasible.

Scientists have suggested that our best bet of colonising the galaxy might be to send human genomes throughout the cosmos (arist's illustration shown) in the hope they seed life on a planet. The radical proposal was made at a talk for the Smithsonian Magazine in Washington DC recently

In a talk at the Smithsonian Magazine’s ‘The Future is Here Festival’ in Washington DC in May, Nasa engineer Adam Seltzner spoke about the future of space exploration.

The 100-year Starship Project is a joint endeavour run by Darpa, Nasa, Icarus Interstellar and the Foundation for Enterprise Development.

Through the project Darpa has previously suggested that 'printing' humans on distant planets, like the proposal suggested here by Seltzner, is a possibility for colonising the Milky Way galaxy.

Announced in January 2012, the project has an overall goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112.

To
 do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies, including 
‘warping’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at 
faster-than-light speeds.

The project is also considering building ‘generation ships’ that move slowly but have a self-sustainable long-term population.

To date Nasa has contributed $100,000 (£60,000) to the project and Darpa $1 million (£600,000).

And aside from reiterating the importance that we continue manned exploration, he spoke of a lesser-known method of space exploration – sending the human genome to far-flung planets.

His somewhat radical proposal, building on work by other researchers, would see humans launched as bacteria to distant planets before being ‘printed’ by methods unknown, perhaps a machine, according to a report written by Meghan Neal for Motherboard.

‘Our best bet for space exploration could be printing humans, organically, on another planet,’ he said.

‘Maybe we will colonize other worlds not with astronauts in space suits, but with bacteria,’ Seltzner continued.

‘Those considerations seem beautiful, fantastic.’

The idea was first dreamed up by Harvard biologists Dr Gary Ruvkun and Dr George Church, as reported in a Harvard Medical School release.

They suggest that fractions of the human genome could be sent to distant worlds in bacteria.

Upon arrival, the various segments would then be reassembled into a human genome.

In fact, in a paper from April 2012, scientists from Kyoto Sangyo University in Japan discussed how so-called ‘reverse panspermia’ might have already happened - albeit by accident.

They say previous impacts could have sent life-bearing meteorites from Earth to other planets.

The Chicxulub crater event, for example, which is thought to have ended the time of the dinosaurs, might have been sufficient to send Earth-based life to other planets in the solar system.

‘If life forms inside remain viable, this would be evidence of life from Earth seeding other planets,’ they wrote.

The proposal would be based around one of two methods. Either bacteria carrying the human genome (strand of DNA pictured) would be sent to 'infect' distant planets and evolve, or a robot would be sent thousands of years in advance and then tasked with printing humans from beamed information

Planets such as Kepler-186f (artist's illustration shown), which was announced in April, provide tantalising hints of habitable worlds outside our solar system. This particular planet is the most Earth-like found to date, orbiting its star in the middle of its habitable zone where liquid water and possibly life could thrive

Quite how these bacteria would grow into humans is up for debate.

They could simply be left to evolve, as life did on Earth, seeding another planet with our own organisms.

Alternatively, an autonomous machine capable of creating cellular life could be sent thousands of years in advance to a habitable exoplanet outside the solar system.

Upon arrival, information on how to genetically construct a human would be beamed to the machine.

Of course, these proposals are something that will only be possible for humans hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of years in the future.

But many scientists are of the belief that we will one day be able to create multicellular life - and it stands to reason this could include an organism as complex as a human.

The theory might sound unlikely but it's not entirely without precedent. In May the European Technology Exposure Facility (Eutef), attached to the exterior of the Columbus module on the ISS, proved that bacteria could survive an interplanetary trip from Earth to Mars, suggesting a journey even further could be possible

The proposal also overcomes a well known problem of interstellar travel - namely, travelling to a distant planet in a human lifetime is impossible based on our current knowledge of the laws of physics.

Without a form of travel that can ‘cheat’ when travelling large distances, such as a wormhole that jumps through space-time, interstellar travel just isn’t a realistic proposition.

So, perhaps to colonise other worlds our best bet is simply to send the ingredients for humanity and let nature take its course.

Whether we’d then be able to communicate with these distant humans, or if they’d know we exist, is another consideration altogether.

If the idea sounds like purely science fiction rather than science fact, it might seem less so when a recent experiment on the ISS is taken into account.

In May the European Technology Exposure Facility (Eutef), attached to the exterior of the Columbus module, proved that bacteria could survive an interplanetary trip from Earth to Mars.

For an interstellar trip they would need more protection in order to survive the long travel time.

But one day down the line, perhaps our descendants will decide that throwing bits of human genome into the cosmos in the hope it sticks on a distant planet is our best bet of colonising the galaxy.

Could solve the problem of how humans can survive interstellar travel

The genome segments would be left to evolve on a distant exoplanet

Or information on how to 'print' a human could be sent to a machine
