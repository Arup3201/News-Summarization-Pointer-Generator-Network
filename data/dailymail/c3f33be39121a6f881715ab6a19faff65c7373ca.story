Paul Scholes discovered the perils of reporting on the touchline  when a stray ball  hit the Manchester United legend during the warm-up at St James' Park.

Yet it could have been a lot worse for the BT Sport pundit when you compare it to others that suffered similar fates when presenting by the pitch.

Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown was victim to a flying ball during his punditry duty at the Emirates in 2012, and even manager Harry Redknapp fell foul during a training session.

Redknapp reacted furiously during a television interview when a ball hit the then-Portsmouth manager as he shouted: 'How can you kick that over here? You try kicking it in the goal and you hit me?

'Got to get some f****** brains, haven't you? No wonder he's in the f****** reserves.'

Speaking with FourFourTwo in 2003, he refused to name which player he was yelling at: 'I mustn't tell you the name of the player. It wouldn't be fair. He was on shooting practice and I was standing at the corner flag when the ball hit me – that tells you everything.'

At least that wasn't in front of an audience like Sportsmail's unfortunate columnist in January 2012.

Arsenal legend Keown got smacked in the face while on duty for ESPN by a stray ball during the warm-up for an FA Cup match at the Emirates where Leeds United were the visitors.

Keown was hit by a stray ball during the warm-up but joked about it in his column for the Daily Mail later

Writing in his column for the Daily Mail days later, Keown joked about the incident: 'It was a former Spurs man who you may have seen hit me with the ball while I was on-air on Monday night.

'Alex Bruce tipped me off that his Leeds team-mate Michael Brown – the ex-Tottenham midfielder – was the culprit. At least he was apparently trying to aim at Robbie Savage, not me.'

Over to Germany, where SkySports reporter Jessica Kastrop was smacked in the back of the head by a stray shot from former Chelsea player Khalid Boulahrouz in 2010.

The footage shows the ball getting closer and closer to its victim until it knocks her forward. Kastrop said afterwards: 'I was fine eventually. Boulahrouz ran over to me straight away and apologised.' 

What about in other sports? American football has its moments, too, such as when Fox reporter Pam Oliver was hit by a Chandler Harnish throw. Thankfully she laughed it off afterwards.

Another female reporter was wiped - not by a football, however, but by a player.

Even baseball reporters aren't immune. Fox presenter Sophia Minnaert was hit by a stray ball that knocked the microphone out of her hand. Afterwards she said: 'Do I get kudos for that defensive play? I'm fine. I'm totally fine.'

It's all part of the dangers of reporting on the touchline, though Scholes may consider himself lucky.
