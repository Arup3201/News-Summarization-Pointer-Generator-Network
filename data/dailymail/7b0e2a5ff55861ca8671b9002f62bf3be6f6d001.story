A Champions League game in England has been implicated in a huge European match fixing investigation.

European police agency Europol has uncovered more than 380 suspicious matches in 15 countries, including a Champions League game played in England in the last three or four years.

The specific match cannot be named for legal reasons, but only six English teams - Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester City and Chelsea - have competed in the Champions League in that time.

Investigated: Champions League games, including one in England, are under scrutiny

The mystery surrounding the 
match-fixing investigation deepened after it emerged neither the 
Football Association nor UEFA were aware of any such probe.

Rob Wainwright, director of Europol - 
the European Union's law enforcement agency, told a news conference that
the match which took place 'in the last three to four years' was one of
380 under investigation.

Europol said a total of 425 match 
officials, club officials, players, and serious criminals are suspected 
of being involved in attempts to fix matches.

Wainwright refused to name which 
English Champions League match in particular due to 'ongoing judicial 
proceedings' - and the FA, which as the governing body in the country 
should be alerted, is also at a loss to know which one.

Manchester United played Braga at Old Trafford in December. There is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation.

A spokesman for The Football 
Association said: 'The FA are not aware of any credible reports into 
suspicious Champions League fixtures in England, nor has any information
been shared with us.

'While the Champions League comes 
under UEFA jurisdiction, The FA, alongside the Premier League, Football 
League and Conference, monitor markets for the top seven leagues and 
three major cup competitions in England and take matters of integrity in
football extremely seriously.'

It is understood UEFA is similarly unaware of an investigation into an Champions League match in England.

A Europol spokesman said he was unable to comment when asked why neither the FA nor UEFA had been informed.

Man City played Real Madrid at the Etihad in November. There is no suggestion that this game was involved in the investigation

Investigators told the news conference
an Asia-based crime syndicate is behind the fixing of the 380 matches, 
along with World Cup and European Championship qualifiers and 'several 
top football matches in European leagues'.

Wainwright said at a press conference 
in The Hague: 'This is the work of a suspected organised crime syndicate
based in Asia and operated with criminal networks around Europe.

'It is clear to us this is the 
biggest-ever investigation into suspected match-fixing in Europe. It has
yielded major results which we think have uncovered a big problem for 
the integrity of football in Europe.'

Wainwright revealed the scale of the 
corruption in Germany, where £13.8 million was wagered on matches in the
country with payments of £1.73m believed to have been paid to those 
involved.

Overall, Europol claim match-fixing had taken place in 15 countries with 50 people arrested to date.

Liverpool played Fiorentina at Anfield in December 2009. There is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation

Wainwright added: 'The focus has been 
on other countries, not the United Kingdom. However we were surprised by
the scale generally of the criminal enterprise and just how widespread 
it was.

'It would be naive and complacent of 
those in the UK to think such a criminal conspiracy does not involve the
English game and all the football in Europe.'

UEFA confirmed it would co-operate with the investigation and stressed it had a zero-tolerance approach to match-fixing.

It added in a statement: 'UEFA is 
aware of the statements made by Europol regarding the alleged 
match-fixing that has taken place in various football competitions, and 
expects to receive further information in the coming days.

'As part of the fight against the 
manipulation of matches, UEFA is already co-operating with the 
authorities on these serious matters as part of its zero tolerance 
policy towards match-fixing in our sport.

Chelsea played Barcelona at Stamford Bridge in April. There is no suggestion that this game was involved in the investigation.

'Once the details of these 
investigations are in UEFA's hands, then they will be reviewed by the 
appropriate disciplinary bodies in order that the necessary measures are
taken.'

FIFA's head of security Ralf Mutschke said prison sentences for fixing needed to be tougher.

He said: 'In football, a national 
association can sanction a member of the football family if they are 
found guilty of contravening the legal, football framework.

'FIFA's disciplinary code provides the opportunity to extend those sanctions, and impose a life ban.

Tottenham played Inter Milan at White Hart Lane in November 2010. There is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation

'But for people outside of football, 
currently the custodial sentences imposed are too weak, and offer little
to deter someone from getting involved in match-fixing.'

Meanwhile, the Danish FA has banned a player for six months for placing bets on a 2011 cup match he played in.

Kristoffer Wichmann, who plays for 
second tier side FC Vestsjaelland was deemed to have used middlemen to 
place bets on the match, although he is appealing against the ban.

Arsenal played Montpellier at the Emirates in November. There is no suggestion this game was involved in the investigation
