Swedish footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic has sparked outrage amid claims he shot dead a moose during a hunting trip.

The controversial 33-year-old, who plays for Paris St Germain in France, was reportedly on a winter vacation in his homeland when he is alleged to have shot the animal.

It has been reported that the  striker killed the 500kg moose with a single 'shot through its heart' during a hunting excursion while he was on a mid-season break from the French league.

According to the newspaper Expressen, the Sweden international was 'very happy' with his trophy.

He has yet to make a statement about the claims, but it is understood that he is a hunting enthusiast. It is estimated that up to 100,000 moose are killed by hunters every year in Sweden.

The former Barcelona and Inter Milan player appeared in a Volvo advert earlier this year in which he aims a gun at a moose. 

But the story has already sparked anger among animal rights activists. 

Camilla Björkbom from Sweden's Animal Rights' Union told Expressen: 'It is problematic. It is always problematic when famous people do things like that, because then it looks like they support this type of activities.'

Many hunting websites that offer guidance on shooting moose suggest aiming for the heart area to ensure the animal is killed quickly and does not endure unnecessary pain.  

The Alaska Department of Fish and Game says the 'objective of every conscientious hunter is to kill an animal as quickly as possible to avoid its suffering and to insure the highest quality meat.

It says that the best area to aim for when hunting a large animal such as a moose is the 'heart-lung vital zone'.

'Any other shot has too great a chance to wound the animal,' the website adds.

Ibrahimovic recently expressed his disbelief after being named second in a list of the 150 greatest Swedish sports stars - losing out to tennis great Bjorn Borg.

Revealing his own version of Sweden's top five stars, he reportedly said: 'On the list I am first, second, third, fourth and fifth, with all due respect to others.'
