Hearing: Rebecca Leighton pictured arriving at the Nursing and Midwifery Council today

The nurse cleared of involvement in poisoning patients at Stepping Hill Hospital has claimed that staff took painkillers home to use 'in case of emergencies' during their holidays.

Rebecca Leighton, 29, spent six weeks in prison in 2011 as police investigated the deaths of men and women whose saline drips had been contaminated with insulin at the hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester.

She was released when prosecutors decided that there was not enough evidence against her.

But Miss Leighton was sacked from Stepping Hill for theft after detectives investigating the deaths found packets of painkillers and opiate-based drugs at her home.

She admitted taking the medication from the hospital and conceded that her fitness to practice was impaired at a hearing today.

During police interviews, she claimed staff regularly took drugs such as the painkiller ibuprofen for their own use, a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) disciplinary panel was told.

Tom Hoskins, for the NMC, said: 'She said that if the police were to search any number of employees from Stepping Hill Hospital, a random person, they would find them also in possession of such tablets.

'The registrant accepts she had removed them and indicated that a lot of other people at the hospital engaged in the same enterprise, talking about an example where a member of staff would go on holiday and would take the drugs with them in case of emergencies.'

A total of 22 people suffered hypoglycaemic episodes after saline drips were allegedly sabotaged with insulin between June and July 2011 at Stepping Hill.

Eight of those victims - all of whom were being treated on acute care wards for seriously ill patients - died.

A second nurse who worked on the same wards, Victorino Chua, was later questioned over three of the deaths and 18 counts of causing grievous bodily harm as well as tampering with medical records.

Mr Chua was given bail and not charged over any of the poisonings.

Chua was held over the deaths of Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and Derek Weaver, 83.

Alleged poisoning victims William Dickson, 82, Linda McDonagh, 60, John Beeley, 73, Beryl Hope, 70, and Mary Cartwright, 89, are believed to have eventually died from natural causes.

In the wake of her release, Ms Leighton spoke of her horror at being linked to the poisonings.

She said she was 'passionate' about her job and wanted to return to a 'normal life' after charges against her were dropped.

Despite her admission, the panel was hearing evidence to decide whether her fitness to practice is impaired.
