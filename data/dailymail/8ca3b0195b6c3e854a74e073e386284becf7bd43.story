It wasn't until I moved to Australia, where league and union enjoy a far friendlier allegiance than in the UK, that I realised just how special rugby league players can be.

Playing for Manly, we used to train closely with our league equivalent, the Manly Sea Eagles, and play a pretty physical version of touch rugby in the park on Sundays.

Their basic skill-set is remarkable and the format of the sport amplifies the need for either standout speed or raw power — both of which make for outstanding athletes. I’m always intrigued to see how league converts adapt to union and Sam Burgess has every opportunity to be a blockbuster hit for Bath and England.

Rugby league players often bring a remarkable and original skill-set when they move across to union

Burgess should be played at inside centre for England, alongside Manu Tuilagi

He has just been named the world’s best player in the league code and appears to have a remarkable effect on all those he works with. There is no question that we have a phenomenal athlete and strong character entering English rugby. If England can build their offensive game around Burgess, he has the potential to deliver on the biggest stage — and turn his country’s attack on its head.

The big question is, where do you play him? Most of the successful converts have either played on the wing or at full back. But Burgess does not have the pace to play in the back three. Nor do I see him being any better than our current crop of forwards — so he must be played at inside centre.

He cannot be involved in the autumn internationals because of injury, but Stuart Lancaster must bring him into the squad at the earliest opportunity. The midfield is the biggest question mark over the England starting XV. Its outcome after the autumn internationals and Six Nations will have a huge impact on the World Cup.

Burgess has earned his stripes playing rugby league and shouldn't have to prove himself all over again

Burgess must be encouraged to play his natural game, rather than try to mould himself overnight into a ‘textbook 12’. He will learn union in time, but it’s important it comes on top of what he already has. This is where Jason Robinson was so successful with England and Australia’s Israel Folau entered the sport in similar fashion. 

They backed their skill-set and continued doing what they did best in league, effectively forcing opponents to adapt to them — not the other way round. England already have a physical midfield. They have been playing big guys like Brad Barritt, Billy Twelvetrees and Manu Tuilagi; but no one comes bigger or more ferocious than Burgess. He’s not going to turn out like Mike Catt or Will Greenwood — both natural playmakers who relied on vision more than physicality — but he has the ability to draw in three or four players at a time. Burgess playing alongside Tuilagi would be interesting to watch!

Jason Robinson proved a huge success after making the switch from league to union

South Africa or New Zealand won’t be afraid of his size, but they will be afraid of his passing and off-loading. Many underestimate just how good league players’ basic skills are. If England can work out a way of exploiting that then they could be on to something very special. England have some solid options at 12, but none of them make you go ‘wow’.

That’s where Burgess is different. If Lancaster can slot him into that spot alongside a fly-half brave enough to stand flat, and with the footwork and touch to find him some clean air, then that 10-12 combination would ask a lot of any defence.

Burgess could be used to release the entire back line; this was the most significant effect of Sonny Bill Williams for the All Blacks.

Most players only get the chance to play in one World Cup and my concern is that he is held back until 2019. That would lead to a lot of ‘what ifs’ and ‘if onlys’ if England go on to lose in the semi-final or the final next year. You have to throw everything at next year’s World Cup. This guy could be what England are missing.

I admire the culture Lancaster has created in the England camp, where you have to earn your stripes. But Burgess has earned his call-up with what he has already achieved in league. Would the other players want him there? Absolutely. When Robinson arrived he lifted the whole camp; he turned a very good team into a really scary team. You get no second chances at the World Cup.
