A daredevil attempting a 6,500ft paragliding jump narrowly cheated death after his parachute became tangled in mid-air.

Justin Clarke, a 43-year-old IT consultant from Norfolk, had launched himself off the 6,200ft-high Mount Babadag in Turkey.

Shortly afterwards, the lines of the thrillseeker's parachute became twisted, causing him to lose control of the glider.

Mr Clarke is then seen trying to pull in the tangled glider in order to stop it dragging him off-course and into a nearby beach resort packed with holidaymakers

A small camera strapped to Mr Clarke's body captured the moment he began hurtling towards the sea.

Despite remaining calm, he is shown desperately trying to re-gain control of the glider before opening up his reserve parachute.

During his ordeal the lines of his glider also wrapped around his arms, resulting in painful burns as he attempted to land safely.

After a couple of minutes, Mr Clarke is shown landing into the sea below before being rescued by a nearby safety boat.

Mr Clarke explained that he was an experienced paraglider, having completed around 65 flights previously.

He had joined up with the Free Flight Academy where he was receiving training from instructor Lee Tryhorn about how to deal with emergency situations.

It was the last flight on the training course, and Justin was learning how to carry out a full stall – a tricky safety procedure employed by paragliders to regain control and balance the glider in extreme weather conditions.

He had already completed the manoeuvre perfectly twice before, but made a mistake on his third and final attempt which caused his lines to become tangled.

Asked what was going through his mind as he realised he was in trouble, Justin said: ‘I had done two full stalls already and just did not complete the last one correctly.

'I lost control and the wing shot underneath me, which can be very very dangerous. 

'If you fall into the wing cloth when it is below you, you end up “gift wrapped” and cannot throw your reserve parachute – being gift wrapped is a likely end of life experience. 

‘Once I realised I had lost control of my glider, there were a few four letter words that ran through my head.

‘But we do it over water, with a safety boat below for the very reason things can go wrong, as was my case.

‘Once I had thrown my reserve ‘chute, the main aim was to get my glider in, as it was down pulling me down wind, meaning I was heading towards the beach and the town of Oludeniz.

‘My instructor Lee Tryhorn was a diamond and it was with his instructions that I was able to learn to fly and to do stuff like this.' 

In 2010, 70-year-old grandfather-of-two Roger Parker escaped death after breaking his shoulder, elbow and foot when his tandem paraglider pilot crashed into the side of a mountain near to Mount Babadag in Turkey.

Mount Babdag is hugely popular with tourists who pay around £50 to do a paragliding jump. The mountain’s height and proximity of its summit to the sea makes it particularly suitable for such extreme sports.
