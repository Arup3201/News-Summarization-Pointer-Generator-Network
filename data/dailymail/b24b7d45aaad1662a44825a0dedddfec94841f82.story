Police are to be issued with equipment that will enable them to test instantly whether a driver is under the influence of drugs.

The kit will analyse a mouth swab for traces of cannabis, meaning officers will not need to wait for a doctor to do a blood test on a suspect.

Initially the equipment will be available only in police stations, but the Home Office hopes to introduce a roadside kit. 

Instant results: A new kit will allow police to test drivers for being under the influence of cannabis - similar to the breathalyser already used to test alcohol levels

A test for other drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and crystal meth, is also being developed.

At least 49 deaths and 640 accidents were caused by drivers using both illegal and medicinal drugs in 2011.

The true figure is thought to be much higher, however, because of the difficulty in detecting whether a motorist has used drugs.

Driving under the influence of drugs is not an offence unless police can prove the driver’s judgment was impaired. But David Cameron has vowed to make drug-driving a crime.

Legislation is expected to be brought in making it an automatic offence to have levels of certain drugs in the bloodstream.

Offenders will face up to six months in jail and a fine of up to £5,000 as well as an automatic driving ban of at least 12 months.

The new test – developed by the Hertfordshire-based firm Draeger – will instantly tell police if it detects THC, the active ingredient in cannabis.

A positive saliva test would mean officers could ask a suspect for a blood sample without first seeking medical approval. This would be needed as evidence to support a prosecution can come only from a blood specimen.
