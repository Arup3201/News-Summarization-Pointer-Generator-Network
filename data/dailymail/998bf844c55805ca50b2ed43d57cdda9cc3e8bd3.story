At the ripe old age of 83 you could be forgiven for putting your feet up, sitting back and enjoying retirement.

But not the world's oldest competitive bodybuilder, Ray Moon, who has just given men less than half his age a run for their money at an international competition.

Mr Moon flexed his muscles on stage once more yesterday at the World Fitness Federation International Championships in Melbourne, Australia.Â

Never too old: Mr Moon returned to the stage after two years of semi-retirement while he fought cancer

The feat is even more remarkable as he was back on stage for the first time since battling bladder cancer.

After two years of semi-retirement, Mr Moon showed he is back to his best as he lined up against competitors in the over 35 category.

Although he did not win, Mr Moon was given a certificate confirming his title as the oldest competitive male bodybuilder.

Mr Moon recently had to scale back his bodybuilding activities as he fought cancer.

However, as soon as he could, he picked up his dumbbells once more to get into training for competition.

At first, he could only lift 1kg (2.2lbs) weights in each hand.

But with his illness now behind him, he is once more back up to 45kg (99lbs) lateral pulls.

He was proudly pictured warming up alongside the likes of fellow competitors Brad McDonall, 38, and Courtney Scott-Cuthbert.

And he also made sure he did not forget the fake tan.

The bodybuilder has previously faced polio, open heart surgery, had a cardiac arrest and been pronounced clinically dead before being fitted with a pacemaker.

Mr Moon took up bodybuilding in his mid-seventies and soon began competing.

Three years ago he was awarded the Guinness World Record for the oldest competitive male bodybuilder.
