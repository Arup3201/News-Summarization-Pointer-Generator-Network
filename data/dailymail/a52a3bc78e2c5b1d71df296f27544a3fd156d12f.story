For the last ten years, Sarah Wulchak has been one very busy woman - and her sad decline and radical physical transformation is illustrated in 23 mugshots from her arrests over 10 years.

From grand theft auto to trespass and aggravated battery, the 34-year-old woman from DeLand, Florida, has managed to be arrested 23 times since 2003 - all in Volusia County.

In her first mugshot taken in 2003, she appears with glasses and relatively healthy looking, but ten years later is as shadow of her former self.

While many of her charges are common misdemeanors, Wulchak made headlines in January 2013 after she allegedly bit off a chunk of her boyfriends ear, according to WPBF.com.

Her boyfriend, Steve Bolin, 53, called police and said Wulchak had attacked him in his bedroom.
