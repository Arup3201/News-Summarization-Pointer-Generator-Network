The 21-year-old tweeting motorist who boasted on Twitter that she had knocked a cyclist off his bike has apologised to the rider.

Trainee accountant Emma Way said she was sorry and revealed that her career may be at risk because of the incident which has had nationwide publicity.

Emma sent a Tweet admitting that she had 'definitely knocked a cyclist off his biker earlier - I have right of way he doesn’t even pay road tax #bloodycyclists'

Collision: Emma Way (left) tweeted she 'definitely knocked a cyclist off his bike earlier'. Toby Hockley (right), 29, came forward as the cyclist involved in the collision and said he was 'lucky to be alive' following the crash

But her angry victim has accused her 
of shocking driving after her car raced past him, hitting his handlebars
and sending him crashing into a hedge.

Miss Way said: 'It was spur of the moment stupid Tweet - there are so many of them flying around.

'But I never realised it would escalate
like this - it is now national and the social networks have blown it up
out of all proportion.

'I just thought he had clipped my wing mirror and if he was injured in any way then I am very sorry.

'I am getting a bad name because of 
it and my employers are getting calls and e-mails. I have been suspended
and I think my career may be over.'

Confession: This tweet by user Emma Way was met with shock and prompted an investigation by Norfolk police

Emma has now spoken to Norfolk police 
about the incident and is waiting to hear if any further action will be 
taken against her for a possible driving offence.

The bike rider Toby Hockley, 29, was 
taking part in a road race near Snetterton race track at the weekend 
when the accident happened.

He said: 'She hit me really hard and I am lucky to be alive - I suffered a bruised knee, a sore elbow and nettle rash.

'She should have stopped and shown 
some respect for other road users - by Tweeting about it, it is almost 
as if she is proud of what she did.

Not angry: Mr Hockley, foreground, said he had not been planning any further action before he was alerted to the Tweet

'I would like her to get a telling 
off from the police rather than anything that is going to affect her 
life. I don’t want her to lose her licence - just an apology.'

A spokesman for her employers Norwich 
accountants Larking Goiwen said: 'We are aware one of our employees 
posted some tweets relating to an incident on their personal twitter 
account.

'Please be assured this is not a view shared by us and we certainly don’t condone sort of behaviour.

'We are treating the incident very 
seriously and a full and detailed investigation will be carried out and 
appropriate action taken.'
