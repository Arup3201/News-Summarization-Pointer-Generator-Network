It was designed to collect excess rain and ground water.

But on Saturday, this storm drain caught something else - a one-year-old Siberian husky.

The pup, named Bella, was spotted trapped in the drain in San Diego, California, by a passerby. 

She was sporting a forlorn expression, while only her head, ears and front leg were poking out.

Trapped: This Siberian husky, named Bella, became stuck in a storm drain in Encanto, San Diego, on Saturday

It is unknown how Bella ended up in the drain, nor how long she had been stuck there for.

Two San Diego County Animal Services officers arrived at the scene in the city's Encanto neighborhood after being alerted to the crisis by the passerby, according to NBC. 

However, as soon as they approached the pup, she retreated further into the drain.

So, the pair devised a new plan in a bid to get Bella out: They blocked the pipe, before walking the animal through the drain to a grate. A strong Good Samaritan then pulled the grate up and away.

Once the piece of metal was removed, the husky could finally be lifted out, county officials said.

The pup who was microchipped, has been reunited with her unidentified owner following the incident, which occurred at the junction of Woodrow Avenue and Viewcrest Drive

And she is not the first animal named Bella to have been rescued by the Animal Services recently. 

Last week, officers are called to a San Diego office building after a boa constrictor - who goes by the same name - slithered out of a toilet in the women's restroom, the Pet Rescue Examiner reported. 

Another rescue: The dog - who has since been rescued and returned to her owner -  is not the first animal named Bella to have been saved by the Animal Services recently. Above, this boa constrictor, who goes by the same name, was captured by the Services after slitering out of a toilet in the women's restroom at an office

A woman in the restroom, Stephanie Lasca, co-founder of Vertical PR + Marketing, was apparently so shocked by the snake's appearance that she screamed, ran out and slammed the door.

The animal was eventually cornered and captured - but only after she had bit one of the handlers.
