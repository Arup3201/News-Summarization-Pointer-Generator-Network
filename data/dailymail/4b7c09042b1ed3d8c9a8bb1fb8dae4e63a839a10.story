Dashcam footage shows the amazing moment an SUV rolled over five times and catapulted three passengers out of four, including one five-year-old boy from the vehicle.

Miraculously everyone involved in the Grant, Kentucky crash on February 12 at the northbound I-75 survived despite none of them wearing seat belts.

The video shows a Mercury Mountaineer drift from the lanes, nearly hitting another vehicle, then apparently losing control and running off the highway into a ditch and up a hillside.

Before the crash: Dash cam footage shows a car swerving into the next lane towards a hillside

The driver: Driver James Lynn along with three other passengers survived a brutal SUV crash

The front passenger, James Lynn, 19, is tossed to the right.

The driver, James Chandler, 23,  is thrown into the ditch.

WCPO reports that the SUV bounces onto the five-year-old-boy and breaks both of his legs.

One 16-year-old boy in the back seat wasn't ejected even though he also wasn't wearing a seat belt.

'As a parent, the worst of the worst runs through your mind when we get those types of calls,' said Grant County Deputy Scott Conrad.

Conrad said it's a miracle that the family survived but noted that the soft ground may have had something to do with their survival.

Up we go: The SUV starts rolling up a hillside and later crashes and flips five times 

Crash!: The SUV can be seen flipping over after it accidentally drives too far to the right 

'The softness of the ground may have contributed to softer landings,' Conrad said.

'It was very soft to walk on from the weather that we had.'

The driver, Chandler suffered injuries to his chest and neck.

The front passenger, Lynn, was injured on his torso and right side.

The 16-year-old injured his head and hands.

No charges have been filed and the accident is still under investigation.

The aftermath: All four passengers survived despite none of them wearing their seat belt
