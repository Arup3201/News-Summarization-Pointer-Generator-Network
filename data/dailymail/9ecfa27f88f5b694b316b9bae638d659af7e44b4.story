Britain is facing a growing exodus of middle-class professionals and managers who are leaving the country to work abroad.

The ‘brain drain’ of executives and middle managers means about 1,500 are leaving the country every week.

In total, 75,000 left in 2010 – making them the biggest single group of individuals departing Britain, a Home Office report revealed.

They made up more than half of the 149,000 British emigrants last year. Most moved because they had been offered a job overseas and intended to stay for the long term.

Business groups said high tax rates were acting as a spur for people to depart the country.

The report said: ‘A large and increasing proportion of British citizens emigrating from the UK are those from professional or managerial occupations and this may have implications for the availability of skills in the UK.’

Two decades earlier, in 1991, this group made up about one in three British departures.

Britons leaving the UK are most likely to be going to Australia, followed by the US and Spain. France, Germany, Canada and New Zealand are also popular destinations.

John Cridland, the director-general of the CBI, said he hoped that cuts to personal tax rates would stem the tide of emigrants.

‘These are disturbing figures,’ he said.

‘There is no doubt that the spike in recent years was due in part to high personal tax rates, which the Chancellor is now tackling.’

The report said high house prices in the UK made emigration attractive to homeowners who were also entrepreneurs, because they could sell up and set up small businesses in expatriate communities.

‘The growth in house values in the UK compared to elsewhere in Europe may have enabled British property owners to sell up and live more cheaply abroad, while enjoying a better climate and quality of life. However, this may have changed since the recession, the report said.

Around 1,500 executives and middle-managers are packing their briefcases and heading to work in foreign climes every week

The UK has 4.7million expats living overseas, putting it eighth in the world for the number of its citizens living abroad.

Emigration from the UK peaked in 2008 at 427,000 but has dropped to about 350,000 a year since then.

Last year around 201,000 leavers were non-British citizens.

The Home Office report also showed that migrants from the Indian sub-continent are much less likely to return home once here than those from any other country.

Arrivals from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan were ‘much more likely to stay permanently in the UK’ than migrants from the wealthier Old Commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada, the report found.

Just one in ten migrants from the Indian sub-continent in the 1980s and 1990s left within two years of arriving, and only 15 per cent left within five years, the figures showed.

Some 86 per cent of Bangladeshis, 81 per cent of Pakistanis, and 70 per cent of Indian migrants entering the UK on a family visa in 2004 had settled in the UK within five years.

More than four in ten of arrivals from Australia and New Zealand left the UK within two years of arriving.

Many were young people on two-year working visas. Nearly six in ten left within five years.

Two-thirds of those from the US and Canada also returned home within five years.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We actively encourage the brightest and the best migrants and the UK remains an attractive destination.

‘But to continue competing and thriving in a global race businesses must invest in the skills of UK workers, and retain our own highly skilled workforce.’
