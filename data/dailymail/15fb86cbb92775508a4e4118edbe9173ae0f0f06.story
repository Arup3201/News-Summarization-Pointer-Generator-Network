A Chinese toddler needed emergency brain surgery after he was skewered by a chopstick while running.

Little Li Kaiyi had the chopstick in his mouth when he tripped and fell forward, driving the implement through the roof of his mouth and into his brain.

The 18-month-old baby was at a friend's house in Yueyang in Hunan Province, China when the terrible accident happened.

After dinner, Li was playing with friends when he stumbled and was rushed to hospital where medics performed emergency surgery to remove the chopstick.

Surgeon Liu Jinfang said: 'The chopstick had 2cm into the brain tissues, and luckily it didn't hurt the brain stem or the major nerves.'

The youngster is expected to be released from hospital shortly and is expected to make a full recovery.
