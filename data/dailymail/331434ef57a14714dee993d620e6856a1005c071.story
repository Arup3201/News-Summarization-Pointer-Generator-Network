Downton Abbey has revived a trend among the horsey set – for riding side-saddle.

The sudden surge in popularity has triggered a shortage of side saddles as riders imitate Lady Mary Crawley, played by Michelle Dockery in the period drama, which begins its fifth series next month.

As even men take up what was once a solely female pursuit, enthusiasts are appealing to riders to search their attics for old side saddles.

Michelle Dockery's character Lady Mary strikes a chord with both male and female viewers - now even men want to bring a touch of Downton Abbey into their daily lives as they spur on the rise of riding side saddle

Sally Lane, of the Side Saddle Association, said: ‘We always get more calls when Downton is on. But we’re desperately short of side saddles.

'If one is not being used, perhaps you’d consider bequeathing, leasing or selling it to us.’

A new, bespoke side saddle can cost up to £4,500 and few places still make them, so refurbishing old ones is essential.

The Queen rode side-saddle at Trooping The Colour until the mid-1980s, and the style will also be seen during this year’s First World War centenary commemorations.
