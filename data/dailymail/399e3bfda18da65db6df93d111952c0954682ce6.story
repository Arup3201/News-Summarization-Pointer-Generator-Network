Whisper any mention of Medinah. Forget any notion of Brookline. Only a miracle or a meltdown on the scale of those occasions in 2012 and 1999 can stop Europe now.

Captain Paul McGinley’s team repelled everything the visitors threw at them during a magnificent US fightback in the morning to win the afternoon foursomes 3½-½ and move to the brink of victory .

A four-point lead — the same as the US held at Medinah and Europe had at Brookline — heading into Sunday's singles is a scenario McGinley could only have dreamed about on Thursday. Europe had won only two of the previous 11 series in foursomes and fourballs.

Here they won two more — they never lost a single foursomes match in two sessions — and, with the greater strength in depth and so many proven competitors, it would be a shock of monumental proportions for them not to finish the job off now.

So many fabulous performances, but Justin Rose has undoubtedly been the European man of the tournament so far.

He was brilliant by any standard in the morning as he and Henrik Stenson won a match laden with a record number of birdies to become the first European pair to win their first three games since Lee Westwood and Sergio Garcia in 2002.

Stenson had a tight back and so sat out the afternoon. In came Martin Kaymer, with the pair up against the wonderful American rookies, Patrick Reed and Jordan Spieth. What a nerve-wracking occasion this proved.

Kaymer missed three putts inside 10ft during a four-hole stretch from the 13th. Reed missed from barely 3ft at the 16th.

In the end, with four tired players on view, it was wholly appropriate that proceedings on this truly fabulous day should all come down to Rose on the final green.

A 6ft putt for a half to leave Europe so close. Well, you can guess what happened next, can’t you? Lee Westwood and Jamie Donaldson’s foursomes victory over Zach Johnson and Matt Kuchar allowed the Englishman to celebrate a cherished milestone. That point, his 23rd achieved over nine Ryder Cup appearances, meant he went past none other than Seve Ballesteros on the all-time list.

One more point today from the singles would see him go past Colin Montgomerie and draw level with Bernhard Langer, leaving him looking up at only Sir Nick Faldo on 25 points.

That tells you everything about what a fantastic Ryder Cup player he is and why McGinley gave him a wild card.

There were some eyebrows raised, given the decision left Luke Donald on the outside, but even the doubters would surely have to admit now that they were wrong.

In two foursomes matches the Englishman and the Welshman were a combined nine under par and had just two bogeys. That’s tremendous golf by any standards.

Equally good were Graeme McDowell and Victor Dubuisson. McGinley deserves great credit for taking Westwood and McDowell to one side and assigning these two rookies to them. Both the senior men gave the debutants an ideal platform to show off their skills and how they seized it.

‘Make no mistake, Victor is the next superstar of European golf,’ said G-Mac. ‘He is the best partner I have had since Rory McIlroy, and that’s saying something.’

And how about Donaldson, making his debut at the age of 38 and mustering two points from three matches.

Alongside Americans Spieth, Reed and Jimmy Walker, the rookies in this Ryder Cup have been immense.

The other European success came from world No 3 Sergio Garcia and world No 1 McIlroy, registering their first full point and with some fine golf as well.

Everything was set up for a morning of good scoring, from the fourballs format to benign weather to faster greens, and trust the top players from the two continents to oblige.

A slew of scoring records fell and immense credit has to go to the Americans, who showed lots of heart following their disappointing afternoon on Friday, when they collected just half a point.

It says everything that all four American pairs were at least eight under, a formidable standard.

Inevitably, Rose and Stenson took the plaudits but there were some gutsy performances from those wearing stars and stripes.

Veteran Jim Furyk and Hunter Mahan contributed with the former finally beating Westwood at the Ryder Cup at the eighth time of asking. These two have played in every Ryder Cup since 1997.

Reed and Spieth were brilliant again in demolishing Thomas Bjorn and Kaymer and then came the late heroics from McIlroy and Ian Poulter against Rickie Fowler and Walker.

Poulter’s nerveless play came too late to earn him an afternoon match alongside his old mate Rose — the pairings had to be in at 12.30pm. Mr Ryder Cup showed up at 12.35pm but it surely left him full of confidence for today.

Not surprisingly, American captain Tom Watson retained faith in three of his four pairings for the fourballs but Europe’s players are so competitively strong it’s hard to take them out twice in the same day. And so the momentum shifted, just as it had on day one.

The champagne’s on ice and 50,000 people will descend on Gleneagles today thinking only of heroes to acclaim. But Medinah remains a fresh memory, and the Ryder Cup’s reputation for drama unrivalled. There’s still work to be done.
