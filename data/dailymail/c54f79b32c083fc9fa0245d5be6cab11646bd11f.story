Robert Pires believes Arsenal can still go on and win the Premier League this season despite already finding themselves nine points off the leaders Chelsea.

The 41-year-old, who had a six-year playing spell with the Gunners, maintains hope that Arsene Wenger's side can overturn the gap at the top, but highlights that the period of fixtures coming up will be crucial to shaping Arsenal's season.

Pires told Sky Sports: I hope we can still win the title. Of course it is going to be very difficult, but the season is very long and the Christmas period coming up will be a very important one for Arsenal.

'The situation is not too different from when I was an Arsenal player. It was very tough, very difficult against teams like Man United, Man City, Chelsea and Liverpool.'

Pires, who recently came out of retirement to play for newly-formed Indian Super League side FC Goa, believes Arsenal are missing one main component within their squad to really push on.

He added: 'I think Arsene Wenger has a very good team at Arsenal but I do think they need one player in midfield in the mould of Patrick Vieira.

'They need a tall player, a strong player because in England you need players who are physical. That position is very important and I think that is the only missing piece.'
