They say don’t count your chickens, but you’d be excused for counting the legs on this chicken caught on tape in Thailand.

The bizarre video features some bemused locals laughing while recording a four-legged chicken wandering around looking for food.

Completely indifferent to the situation, the chicken’s two extra deformed legs trail behind it and drag along the floor as it walks.

A woman picks up the chicken and brings it into better view of the camera and the bird seems perplexed by the attention it has gained.

The video concludes with a close-up shot of the chicken minding its own business, seemingly content with its additional body parts.

Surprisingly, four-legged chickens are not as uncommon as many people would think.

In 2005, a live chicken was found among 36,000 other birds at a farm in America.

Named Henrietta, the bird managed to go unnoticed for 18 months at Brendle Farms in Somerset, Pennsylvania, before it discovered by a foreman.

Farmer Mark Brendle's 13-year-old daughter Ashley named the chicken and asked to keep it as a family pet.

The bird had two normal front legs but behind those were two more which were dragged behind when Henrietta walked, exactly like the chicken featured in this video.

The condition called Polymelia is a birth defect that results in individuals having more limbs, which are usually shrunken or deformed.

This can sometimes occur when an embryo begins to develop as conjoined twins.

Before one twin stops growing, leaving the remaining developments – often limbs – of the undeveloped twin attached to the body of the live baby.
