Google is to meet data regulators across the European Union to discuss the way it handled the EU's 'right to be forgotten ruling'.

In May the European Court of Justice ruled that links to 'irrelevant' or outdated articles should be erased from search engine results if those mentioned in the articles request their removal.

That verdict, along with Google's decision to apply the practice only to its European search engines, has pitted privacy advocates against freedom of speech defenders, who argue the process will be abused in order to cover up information that should remain easily accessible to the public.

Debate: Regulators can take Google to court if it refuses to delete articles they consider 'irrelevant' or outdated, as happened in Spain where the 'right to be forgotten' ruling originated

European 
data protection authorities are meeting representatives of Google, 
Microsoft and Yahoo to discuss the implementation of the landmark 
ruling.

European
 Union privacy watchdogs have reportedly raised a number of concerns 
about the way the ruling is being implemented, particularly by Google.

Regulators
 can take Google to court if it refuses to meet their demands, as 
happened in Spain where the 'right to be forgotten' ruling originated.

Under
 particular scrutiny is Google's decision to only remove results from 
its European search engines - such as Google.co.uk - meaning anyone can 
easily access the hidden information by switching to the widely used Google.com.

Experts
 have said this effectively defeats the purpose of the ruling, which 
gives people the right to ask search engines to stop links to 
information deemed 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or 
excessive' from appearing in searches for their name.

'Google has claimed that the decision is restricted to localised versions of Google...There appears to be no basis for that claim at all' said Ashley Hurst, a partner at Olswang, a law firm.

Google declined to comment ahead of today's meeting.

Another 
issue likely to be raised by the EU watchdogs is Google's decision to 
notify the owners of the websites that have been removed from search 
results.

This sparked 
controversy three weeks ago when Europe's most popular search engine 
removed links to an article by a well-known BBC journalist about an 
ex-Wall Street banker, and several links to stories in a UK newspaper.

The
 authors of the stories wrote about the removal, thereby 
drawing attention to the issue and feeding speculation about who 
requested the removal.

Google eventually reinstated a few of the links.

EU privacy watchdogs are concerned about the effect the notification process could have on people making the requests.

Google already notifies the owners of websites that are removed from search results due to copyright infringements.

Privacy
 advocates and legal experts said the backlash over the aforementioned 
articles showed the difficulty of implementing the privacy ruling given 
the broad criteria laid down by the court for information that is 
inadequate or irrelevant.

'We
 are likely to see complainants dressing up libel complaints as data 
protection complaints as it is easier to prove that data is inaccurate 
than it is to prove that it is libelous,' Hurst said.

'This will lead to some difficult decisions for Google,' he added.
