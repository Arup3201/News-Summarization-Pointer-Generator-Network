A frail pensioner was killed for just a few pounds in cash by handbag thieves who ambushed her in an alleyway.

Widow Paula Castle, 85, who was registered blind, died from bleeding on the brain after she was attacked as she returned from the shops.

The grandmother was followed by the thieves, who knocked her to the ground and stole her bag.

Scene: Paula Castle, 85, fell to the ground hitting her head during the attack in this alleyway in West London

Police condemned the ‘cowardly attack’ and said her handbag was found discarded in a garden nearby.

Neighbours said Mrs Castle was a 
‘strong little lady’ who lived an independent life despite suffering a 
double tragedy over the past decade. Her son, a local Tory councillor, 
died suddenly from a heart attack in 2007, three years after her husband
passed away.

Graham Driscoll, 49, who grew up on 
the street where she lived, said the victim was unlikely to be carrying 
much cash or any valuables.

He said: ‘The scumbags that did this 
probably don’t even know she’s dead, and if they do, they probably don’t
care. If they got £10 from her purse I suppose they would have thought 
that it was worth it.’

Tributes: Flowers have been left at the scene where Mrs Castle was knocked over by two thugs who snatched her handbag

Specialist police officers scour the area close to the scene of the attack. A murder investigation has now been launched

The robbery took place a short distance from a primary school, in Greenford, West London, on Monday afternoon.

It is the latest shocking attack to 
highlight rising levels of street crime which have soared by as much as 
40 per cent in some parts of the capital.

Witnesses saw two black teenage boys 
wearing dark clothing and hoods loitering around the alleyway in the 
minutes before Mrs Castle was robbed.

Police believe she was returning from a nearby Tesco Extra supermarket when they ran up behind her and forced her to the ground.

A passerby heard her cries for help 
and ran to her aid.

An ambulance took her to hospital but her condition 
deteriorated overnight and she died from bleeding on the brain.

Detective Chief Inspector Russell 
Taylor said surgeons could not operate because of her frail condition. 
He added that the attack had been ‘callous and cowardly’.

He said Mrs Castle’s recovered handbag contained her purse but her keys were missing.

Residents in the quiet cul-de-sac 
where Mrs Castle lived for almost 60 years said the local authority is 
under pressure to shut the alleyways because they are a magnet for 
crime.

Paul Honor, 53, said: ‘They are quiet and secluded and attract 
crime. If that alleyway had been closed Mrs Castle would still be alive 
today.’

He described Mrs Castle as ‘proud and independent’, and added: 
‘Who would do something like that? Anyone who attacks a defenceless old 
woman is just sick.’

Mr Honor said Mrs Castle’s husband Ken
had died aged 80 in 2004, and her son Brian, a senior figure at Ealing 
Council, died in 2007 when he was only 51. ‘I think she took the two 
deaths pretty hard,’ he said. ‘That family haven’t had a lot of luck.’

Last night, police arrested two boys 
aged 15 and 14 on suspicion of murder and a second robbery on Tuesday. 
They were being questioned at a West London police station.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
