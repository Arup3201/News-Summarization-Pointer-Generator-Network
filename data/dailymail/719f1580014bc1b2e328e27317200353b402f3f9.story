Manchester City might have seen their Champions League dreams end in Barcelona on Wednesday night, but they are the Barclays Premier League's big winners this season in terms of money made from taking part in Europe's premier competition.

Defeat at the Nou Camp left Manuel Pellegrini's men with just the Premier League title to fight for in what is looking increasingly like a disappointing season at the Etihad Stadium, on the pitch at least.

Off it, City's staff will be delighted to be able to bring in £28.4million-worth of revenue from their participation in Europe, more than Chelsea and Arsenal - who both joined City in dropping out at this stage - and group stage flops Liverpool.

Chelsea were knocked out by Paris Saint-Germain at the same stage as City but take home less money

The reasoning behind City's increased income is their league positioning from last year, which affects the market pool shared between the clubs and accounts for half of the money paid to participating clubs.

The Premier League champions  get 40 per cent of the money set aside for English sides, with Liverpool taking 30 per cent, Chelsea on 20 per cent and Arsenal getting just 10 per cent.

The other half of money paid to clubs comes from prize money  based on the stage they are knocked out at.

Given their third-place position in the Premier League last year and having advanced to the second round with City and Arsenal, Chelsea are the second biggest earners on £28.4m.

Figures exclude market pool share, clubs also earn £700,000 per group stage win and £350,000 per group stage draw

London rivals Arsenal brought in the same level of revenue as Liverpool - £21.6m. This comes down to the Anfield club's better league position last season - second rather than fourth - plus the topping up of their total by £0.8m from a brief stint in the Europa League.

Come the final in Berlin on June 6, whoever lifts the famous trophy could pick up a prize pot approaching £26.8m, dependent on their group stage results, and that's before the market pool money is considered.

They also get the chance of another payday in the UEFA Super Cup next season, played between the Champions League and Europa League winners. That one-off game paid out £2.1m to this season's victors, Real Madrid.
