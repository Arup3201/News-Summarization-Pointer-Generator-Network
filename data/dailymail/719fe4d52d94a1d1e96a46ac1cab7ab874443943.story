Grace Reid came agonisingly close to Scotland's first Commonwealth Games diving medal in 56 years in the women's one-metre springboard final in Edinburgh on Friday, but finished fifth.

The 18-year-old, diving in her home pool, was in silver medal position entering the final round, but finished with a total of 269.40 as Canada's Jennifer Abel won with a score of 287.25.

Australia's Maddison Keeney (281.95) took silver and her compatriot Esther Qin (278.65) bronze.

So close: Grace Reid finished fifth in the one-metre springboard final to just miss out on a medal

Attempt: Reid was bidding to become the first Scottish diver to win a Commonwealth medal in 56 years

Australia's 15-year-old Georgia Sheehan finished fourth, just 0.05 behind Qin.

Reid was hoping to become Scotland's second diving medallist, after Sir Peter Heatly, who is now 90 and won the last of his five medals in Cardiff in 1958.

Heatly watched his grandson James dive in the Royal Commonwealth Pool earlier this week.

England's Hannah Starling (264.05) was seventh.

Rebecca Gallantree and Alicia Blagg - the pair who combined for synchronised three-metres platform gold on Wednesday - scored 259.20 to place ninth and 257.50 for 10th, respectively.

Struggle: Hannah Starling came in seventh place for England as she failed to get towards the podium

Reid's best dive was her third of five, a forward 1 1/2 somersault with two twists.

Keeney was leading after three rounds, but false started with her third dive and was deducted two points from each award to fall to fifth, entering the final dive.

Reid was one of those to benefit, climbing to silver medal position, but with her final dive she was unable to supplant Sheehan at the top of the rankings.

Abel moved into pole position with four divers left, pushing Reid into third place, and Keeney knocked the Scot out of the medal positions.

Reid was competing in front of Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond and rugby union great Gavin Hastings.

She was unaware of being in medal contention and happy to achieve a personal best.

'I was in my little bubble,' she said. 'I had my headphones on full blast. I had Run the World by Beyonce - it's a must.

'Someone was telling me I was up and down that leaderboard like a yo-yo. I couldn't have told you.'

Reid's fifth dive was 11th out of the 12 in the field, having saved a safe option.

'It's just the way my list works out that that's the easier dive, but it's quite a solid one. When I was feeling a bit nervous I relaxed into that one.

'Whereas maybe if it was a bit harder it might not have gone so well and I wouldn't have got as good a PB.'
