Dr Nancy Snyderman apologized for violating quarantine guidelines on Monday - but made sure her NBC team shared the blame

NBC chief medical correspondent Nancy Snyderman has dodged blame for violating a voluntary Ebola quarantine  agreement by visiting her favorite soup restaurant. 

The 62-year-old doctor made an apologetic statement to NBC News on Monday which nevertheless shifted responsibility for the breach on to the whole team.

Dr Snyderman wrote: 'While under voluntary quarantine guidelines, which called for our team to avoid public contact for 21 days, members of our group violated those guidelines and understand that our quarantine is now mandatory until 21 days have passed. 

'We remain healthy and our temperatures are normal.

'As a health professional I know that we have no symptoms and pose no risk to the public, but I am deeply sorry for the concerns this episode caused.'  

She added: 'We are thrilled that Ashoka (Mukpo) is getting better and our thoughts continue to be with the thousands affected by Ebola whose stories we all went to cover.' 

However her NBC colleague, Today anchor Matt Lauer, blasted the doctor today to TMZ, saying she was at fault for breaking the voluntary quarantine.

Lauer said: 'She's already admitted it was wrong... she knows she made a mistake.

'It was extraordinary time, we have to take extraordinary measures. It was a mistake, it won't happen again.' 

Witnesses said that the physician and broadcaster wore sunglasses with her hair in a ponytail as she pulled up outside the Peasant Grill in Hopewell Boro, New Jersey, close to Princeton University, last Thursday.

Dr Snyderman was one of seven people ordered to cut off all human contact for 21 days on Friday as doctors treat the station's cameraman Ashoka Mukpo for the deadly disease. 

It emerged this weekend that the crew would have been allowed more freedom if it was not for Dr Snyderman's alleged trip to the Peasant Grill, where she is said to be a regular and love the soups. 

Shortly after the alleged trip to the dining spot, the New Jersey Department of Health forced the crew into mandatory quarantine.

The NJ Health Department said: 'Unfortunately, the NBC crew violated this agreement and so the Department of Health Friday evening issued a mandatory quarantine order to ensure that the crew will remain confined until October 22.

'The NBC crew remains symptom-free, so there is no reason for concern of exposure to the community.' 

The team had initially been encouraged to isolate themselves following Mukpo's diagnosis.

The group was reporting on the Ebola outbreak for NBC News in Liberia when Mukpo, their freelance cameraman, was diagnosed with the virus just a day after he was hired to work for the team. 

Mukpo's family said last week that he believed he had contracted Ebola when he was washing down a vehicle that had transported bodies that perished from the disease. Ebola is transmitted through contact with blood and body fluids.

The cameraman was infected in West Africa but is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha after being flown in on a specially-altered flight with an isolation chamber.

The 33-year-old has received an experimental drug called brincidofovir, or CMX001, and a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly, who beat Ebola.

Mukpo returned to Twitter on Monday to thank well-wishers for the 'good vibes' and say that he was feeling better. It also emerged this weekend that the freelance cameraman was facing half a million dollars in medical bills.

A page on charity fundraising site, Gofundme, revealed he had raised close to $50,000 towards the cost of his treatment.  

An NBC spokesman said on Monday that the network could not comment on any individual case, but noted that the team was deemed to be low-risk upon its return from Liberia.

He added that they had agreed to follow the guidelines set by local health authorities which included the 21-day isolation period.

He said: 'We fully support those guidelines and continue to expect that they be followed.

'Our team are all well with normal temperatures, which they check multiple times a day, and they are also in daily contact with local health officials.'

Meanwhile, in a phone interview with the Today show last week, Dr Snyderman said all the gear she and her crew used was being disinfected because they all shared work space and vehicles.

She also said that she believed she and her team were at a low risk because they have been 'hyper-vigilant'. 

Hospitals across the U.S. remained on high alert on Tuesday over the outbreak of Ebola.

Despite wearing protective clothing, a nurse in Texas was diagnosed this weekend with the disease after treating Thomas Eric Duncan, the first man to be diagnosed in the U.S.

Nina Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas was one of the team of medical staff at Texas Health Presbyterian where she treated Mr Duncan. 

She is now being kept in isolation at the same hospital and is said to be in a stable condition after also receiving a blood transfusion from Dr Brantly.  

Around 150 travelers per day from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will now be stopped and checked with contactless thermometers at JFK Airport in New York in an attempt to prevent the disease getting into the United States again.

The 2014 Ebola outbreak has been most prevalent in three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and smaller outbreaks have been reported in both Senegal and Nigeria.

The new scheme will be expanded over the next week to Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport.
