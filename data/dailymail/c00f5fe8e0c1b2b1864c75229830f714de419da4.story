People who have heart surgery when there is a full moon stay in hospital for less time than those who have surgery at other stages of the Moon's cycle

People who have heart surgery when there is a full moon stay in hospital for less time than those who have surgery at other stages of the Moon’s cycle, research suggests.

A study carried out by Rhode Island Hospital, in the U.S., revealed that surgery, especially that to correct acute aortic dissection, tends to result in a lower death rate when the Moon is waning.

The research was carried out to establish the effect of natural time variations on survival rates and length of hospital stay following heart surgery.

‘While there has been previous research on the seasonal impacts of cardiovascular disease, there has not been any data about the effect of the lunar cycles on cardiac cases, until now,’ said senior author Dr Frank Sellke.

He added: ‘We focused the study on patients having aortic dissection and found that the odds of dying following this procedure were greatly reduced during the waning full moon, and that length of stay was also reduced during the full moon.’

Aortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the lining of the aorta. This tear allows a column of blood to enter the aortic wall forcing the layers apart.

This causes severe pain and is classed as a medical emergency as it can quickly lead to death without treatment.

Researchers studied the impact of lunar cycles and seasonal variation on two surgical groups – one of patients having repair of ascending aortic dissection, and another of patients having aortic dissection and either aortic valve surgery, coronary bypass surgery, or both.

They also studied the relationship between the lunar cycle and the length of the patients' stay in hospital.

The study also revealed that surgery, especially that to correct acute aortic dissection, tends to result in a lower death rate when the Moon is waning

The study indicated that patients who 
have aortic dissection repairs performed during the full moon phase had a
 significantly shorter length of stay than those who were treated during
 other stages of the Moon’s cycle – 10 days for the full moon cycle 
compared to 14 days for the other phases.

‘Can we always plan for such procedures to be performed around lunar cycles? Of course not,’ Dr Sellke said.

‘But better understanding the effects of the environment – including seasonal and lunar cycles – on our health can help us to better understand these rhythms, and ultimately provide better care for our patients.’

The research was published in the journal Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery.
