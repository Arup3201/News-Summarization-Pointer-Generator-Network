German champions Bayern Munich have won the race to sign highly-rated defender Mehdi Benatia from Roma.

The 27-year-old Morocco international had reportedly been a target for both  Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea after excelling at the Stadio Olimpico to help Roma finish second in the Serie A table last season.

But Bundesliga giants Bayern have now secured his services for the next five years.

Done deal: Bayern Munich have completed the signing of Mehdi Benatia from Roma

Main man: Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea were all interested in the Moroccan defender

A statement published on the club's official website read: 'On Tuesday afternoon the German champions reached an agreement with Roma over the transfer of Mehdi Benatia. Both clubs have agreed not to disclose the transfer fee.

'Benatia will come to Munich in the next few days to undergo a medical. The central defender will then sign a five-year contract.'

Bayern boss Pep Guardiola, whose side kicked off their latest title defence with a 2-1 victory over Wolfsburg at the weekend, has already strengthened his back-line with the summer addition of Juan Bernat from Valencia.

But the loss of Javi Martinez for around six months due to torn cruciate ligaments has necessitated the recruitment of another body in the back four.
