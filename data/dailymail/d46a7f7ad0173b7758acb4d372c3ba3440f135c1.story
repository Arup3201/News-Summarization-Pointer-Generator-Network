One month and a day after their first data dump of private information stolen while hacking Sony, the now infamous Guardians of Peace seem to have gone quietly into the night, failing to deliver the much hyped 'Christmas gift' they claimed would destroy the studio.

'We are preparing for you a Christmas gift,' the group posted online in mid-December. 

'The gift will be larger quantities of data. And it will be more interesting. The gift will surely give you much more pleasure and put Sony Pictures into the worst state.' 

Yet days later a letter released by the hackers on December 18 said that Sony had 'suffered enough.'

People wait in line on Christmas day to watch the first screening of the controversial movie The Interview  in Atlanta, Georgia. The promise of more Sony secrets being revealed has so far failed to materialize

Since then the hackers appear to have turned their attention to the FBI and on December 21 they posted a message which cynically 'praised' the FBI's investigation into the hack, with a link yo a video that repeated the phrase 'You are an idiot' repeatedly.

On Christmas Day, people flocked to the 300 or so cinemas showing the movie.  

'We are taking a stand for freedom,' said theater manager Lee Peterson of the Cinema Village East in Manhattan, where most of Thursday's seven screenings had sold out by early afternoon. 

'We want to show the world that Americans will not be told what we can or cannot watch. Personally, I am not afraid.'

At Atlanta's Plaza Theater, a sell-out crowd Thursday hailed the film's release, washing down popcorn with beer and cocktails and uniting for a boisterous sing-along of 'God Bless America' before the opening credits.

'This is way more fun than it would have been,' said Jim Kelley of Atlanta, who waited outside with his daughter, Shannon. The elder Kelley added, with mocking sarcasm, 'This is almost dangerous, like we're living life on the edge.' 

While the Guardians of Peace may be done, a new hacking group has already stepped in and taken their place, managing to shut down the company's PlayStation network at the worst possible time - Christmas Day.

No backlash: This despite the fact that Sony decided to reverse their decision made last week to shelve the film following threats of a terrorist incident

According to Deadline, a group called Lizard Squad is taking credit for the hack, which managed to put the network out of commission for hours not just once, but twice during the holiday. They are also claiming to have done the same to Xbox Live.

This hack pales in comparison however to the damage inflicted on Sony and its employees as a result of the Guardians of Peace hack.

And of those employees, no one has had to endure more than studio head Amy Pascal, whose work emails were released on a near daily basis.

The hackers began their reign of terror on November 24 by hacking into employee computers and displaying a flashing skull with a cryptic message informing workers 'we've obtained all your internal data.'

The computers would remain down for over a week, and a few days later the hackers deliver their first of many shocking dumps when the leak the Brad Pitt war drama Fury as well as unreleased studio titles including Annie, Mr. Turner, Still Alice and To Write Love On Her Arms online.

It was around this time in late November that speculation began to mount that North Korea was likely behind the hack, a claim that seems to be based on nothing other than the fact that the country's UN ambassador Ja Song Nam wrote a letter to UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon taking issue that a film that depicts the assassination of a sitting world leader was allowed to be made, let alone released.

And although the Guardians fail to even address these claims, or make any demands of Sony, until well into December, the story continues to grow and is accepted by many as fact long before the FBI claims to have actual proof of the country's involvement.

It is in December that the hackers really turn things up, dumping an astonishing amount of information in the first two weeks of the month.

Salaries of the company's top executives become public, the script for the new James Bond film is leaked, and then there are the emails attacking an assortment of A-list actors, writers and directors, along with a racist exchange between Pascal and her frequent pen-pal in many of these leaked emails, producer Scott Rudin, in which the two mock President Obama by listing what his favorite movie might be.

The two would later release individual public apologies for their comments. 

This racist exchange is still being addressed by Pascal, who flew to New York to meet with Al Sharpton and has given the go ahead to a new program dedicated to promoting racial diversity in film.

Pascal does however manage to come off as respectful and understanding when speaking about many of Hollywood's biggest stars, save one incident in which she labels Adam Sandler an 'a**hole' not once, but twice.

Rudin on the other hand seems to have no problem talking about the talent behind their back, particularly Angelina Jolie who he labels 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' in one email, and in another exchange actually removes from the chain in order to tell Pascal that the actress is 'out of her mind.' 

During this time the group also starts dumping employee medical records, and most notably there letter on December 8 demanding that Sony stop the release of their upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview.

Then, on December 13 with the scandal at near fever pitch, the group announces plans for their upcoming 'Christmas gift' which they say will put Sony 'into the worst state.'

Then things go quiet until December 16, when the group follows up their demand by threatening a terrorist attack of any movie theater set to play The Interview when it is released on December 25.

Everywhere: The film has now been released across three viewing platforms - theaters, on demand and online

By day's end, the four largest theater chains in the country announce they will not show the film, and the following day Sony cancels the film's release.

It is then that the Guardians release the aforementioned December 18 letter saying the Sony has suffered enough.

Things finally turned around on Wednesday however for Sony, when Christmas came exactly one day early and the studio was able to declare victory over their hackers by releasing The Interview online.

Making the release even sweeter for Sony was the massive outpouring of public support for the film, with thousands turning out for Christmas Eve midnight screenings across the country and tens of thousands of Americans streaming the film online.

And as an added bonus for Sony, the studio will now go down in the history books for becoming the first studio to release a major motion picture online, as well as being the first studio to simultaneously allow for the viewing of a film across three different platforms - theaters, online and video on demand.

'It has always been Sony's intention to have a national platform on which to release this film,' Sony Pictures chair and CEO Michael Lynton said in a statement.

'We chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day, and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release.'

Even more impressive however is how quickly the studio managed to pull this all together after initially deciding to hold off on distributing the film last week.

Sony only announced on Tuesday that the film would play in selected theaters and be released to video on demand on Thursday.

As for the big online announcement, that was confirmed less than an hour before the movie appeared on Google Play, YouTube, Microsoft Xbox Video and a Sony website created for the film, with the option of renting the film for $5.99 or downloading it for $16.99. 

There are still questions as to just who was behind the hacking as well, with many experts in the cybersecurity field questioning an FBI report that they say proved North Korea's government masterminded the attack.

The experts all firmly believe the hack had to be an inside job.
