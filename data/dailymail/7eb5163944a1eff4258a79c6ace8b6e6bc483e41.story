Somewhere amid what seems like a never-ending cascade of empty promises and psychobabble about ‘positive signs’ and a brighter future for English football, there was this frank assessment of the World Cup by Jack Wilshere.

‘It’s easy for me to stand here and say we’re young and we can go forward,’ said the Arsenal midfielder. ‘But if you look at a team like Germany, they’ve got young players who are delivering now.

‘Time is running out for us to say we’re young. I’ll be 23 in January and that’s a good age for a footballer. Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling are good young players.

'Luke Shaw looked like he had played over a hundred games for his country. He was just natural. They showed in this tournament what they can do. But in the next tournament, we really have to deliver.

‘It’s a nice group of young players and hopefully we can stick together, learn from this, take all this disappointment and bottle it up. This is the worst feeling.’

Roy Hodgson’s squad returned home on Wednesday having not won in five games since they left for a training camp in Florida. They failed to live up to expectations that were at an all-time low and a summer of soul-searching begins.

Like Wilshere, Phil Jones is 22 and another who can no longer hide in the ‘emerging’ category. Of Manchester United’s outfield players, only Patrice Evra and Wayne Rooney started more Barclays Premier League games last season.

There are feelings at Old Trafford that a player of terrific potential has not progressed as they hoped. Not helped by the fact that Jones is prone to accidents and unsure of his best position.

‘I’d like to go back to the club and cement a regular place,’ he said. ‘I’ve said in the past few years that sometimes it doesn’t really affect me but it is nice to cement a regular place. Hopefully I can do that.

‘It’s for the manager to decide the position I play. You’ve seen me play centre back, right back and the holding role in midfield. Obviously, I think I’m an out-and-out defender.

‘I’m happy to play anywhere for Manchester United. That’s for the manager to decide.’

It is a big season for Jones under new United boss Louis van Gaal and important for England that his manager restores some direction. Chris Smalling, 24, and Danny Welbeck, 23, fall into the same bracket.

Time to deliver: Chris Smalling, who played for England against Costa Rica, must perform more consistently for Manchester United next season

Neymar, Mario Gotze, James Rodriguez and Thibaut Courtois have supported Wilshere’s point that players can deliver influential performances at 22.

PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor spoke on Wednesday of the need for firmer ‘home-grown’ quotas.

The Premier League argue that investment must be made by the FA at grassroots level to produce more skilful young players to compete with those from abroad and that if they are good enough they will break into the first teams. It is the ideological clash at the heart of the English game.

Sir Trevor Brooking steps down after more than a decade in charge of development and coaching education, during which time the Premier League has become stronger and the FA has been bullied in the club-versus-country struggles at all age levels.

Influential: Colombia's James Rodriguez, 22, has scored three times at the finals so far

Meanwhile England’s tournament results have bombed and the senior team appear unaware what it takes to win a competitive game.

Brooking’s duties will be absorbed into the realm of Dan Ashworth, the FA’s director of elite development. Will that reverse the tide? Who knows?

England, who started the World Cup somewhat generously ranked 10th, can expect to be overtaken by a pack including Holland, Chile, Belgium, Greece, France, Mexico and possibly even Costa Rica.

Rankings will matter next year when they affect the 2018 World Cup qualifying draw. If England wallow outside Europe’s top 10 they are likely to be thrown into a group with a team such as Germany, Holland or Spain.

So Hodgson needs his young stars to develop. His instinct is to shield them but the hype intensifies when a country produces such a small number of players at the required standard. When a dozen per year emerge, demanding international recognition, then the hype will be diluted.

England need Shaw, Barkley, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, John Stones and Sterling to mature and improve, coping with the sort of set-backs which have hit Wilshere and Jones since their days as teenage sensations.

More than that, Hodgson must hope these players are not anomalies but represent the start of a new cycle; that more high-grade young footballers with an appetite to reach the top are produced by club academies.

Evidence for this is not overwhelming.

He also needs those such as Wilshere and Jones back on track. At least they are showing the right attitude.

Soldiering on: Wilshere knows he has a very important season ahead for Arsenal and England

The Arsenal man plans a short holiday before reporting back to his club, in an effort to keep fit.

‘I’ll go back early,’ said Wilshere. ‘I’m not sure I’ll go away with the team (to the USA) but my fitness is on the way up and I don’t want to lose that. It’s a big season for me, a big season for Arsenal.’

It’s a big season for England, too.
