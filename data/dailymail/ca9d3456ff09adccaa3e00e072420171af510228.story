What started as a random purchase of some vintage mugshots on eBay quickly transformed into a life-changing project for Diarmid Mogg.

The Scottish man became interested in American crime stories after reading Least Wanted, a coffee table book that pulled together hundreds of mug shots, and then found about six genuine ones himself from a small town in Pennsylvania for 'a couple of pounds' online.

The photos came with their respective arrest cards, dated between 1930 and 1960, and after researching each of the recorded crimes, he realized they told a wonderful story of New Castle, a bygone industrial boom town near the Ohio border, The Appendix reported.

Snapshot: A Scottish man has used old mugshots that he obtained from all over the world that were all taken in the U.S. town of New Castle to tell a history of the place. This shot, taken on May 28, 1938, is of John Zuzow, who was jailed for stealing a car, burgling a store, getting into a fight in a bar and resisting arrest

Sophia Lyshooka was sixteen-years-old and married when she was admitted to hospital in 1942. Four years later, at the age of 20, she was arrested for the crime of abduction. Those two facts, and whatever can be discerned in this photograph, are all that is known of her, taken February 1946

Vincent DeLillo was charged with pick pocketing 'citizens incapacitated by liquor' on November 17, 1937

Lee Render was nicknamed 'Jack the Peeper' after being caught looking into someone's window on September 24, 1945

Mogg set out to source more of these law enforcement portraits from the same town and bring together as many as he could.

To his surprise he found them scattered all over the world.

'I always asked the seller how they had originally come by the pictures,' Mogg said.

'The usual answer was that theyâ€™d bought them from other collectors.

'No 
one knew for sure how the photographs had first ended up for sale, but I
 gradually worked out that, sometime in the 1990s, the police department
 had cleared out its files and thrown hundreds- maybe thousands - of old 
photographs in the trash.

'A few hundred images were surreptitiously 
saved from destruction by a police officer nearing retirement.'

Mogg then reconstructed the stories behind the pictures, mostly from old copies of the local paper, the New Castle News.

He has spent years putting all these stories together, and has visited the town a few times, documenting everything in a website he has called Small Town Noir.

'The men and women in these pictures saw things that none of us will ever
 see,' he said.

'All that we can do is look clearly at their faces, listen 
carefully to their stories and let them tell us what they can about 
their world, and what life was like in that long-gone town.'

New Castle sits midway between Lake Erie and Pittsburgh, over by the Ohio border, and today has a population of 23,000
