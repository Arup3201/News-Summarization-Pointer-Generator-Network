Criticised: Lord Mandelson has been accused of acting like a 'Kremlin lackey' by agreeing to attend an economic conference in Russia

Lord Mandelson has been accused of acting like a ‘Kremlin lackey’ by agreeing to attend an economic conference in Russia.

The former Labour minister is on the list of those expected to be at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in two weeks.

David Cameron, the White House and the Labour Party have all called for a boycott of the business event amid concerns about Russia’s aggressive stance on Ukraine. It has been dubbed Vladimir Putin’s ‘vanity summit’.

Andrew Foxall, a director of the Russia Studies Centre at the Henry Jackson Society think-tank, said Lord Mandelson risked being seen as a ‘Kremlin lackey’ who was  ‘jeopardising’ Britain’s attempts to isolate Russia’s economy.

The former business secretary, who also served as an EU trade commissioner, is down to attend in his capacity as chairman of Global Counsel LLP, an advisory firm.

The former Cabinet heavyweight praised President Putin at last year’s summit for his ‘intelligent and strong’ economic leadership.

Also among those listed as attendees this year are Bob Dudley, the chief executive of BP, and executives from Johnson & Johnson, and Pepsi. They will rub shoulders with bosses from Russian firms such as Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil.

Oleg Deripaska, a Russian billionaire who entertained Lord Mandelson on his superyacht in Corfu when the politician was an EU commissioner, is also on the guest list.

The pair’s relationship came under scrutiny after aluminium tariffs were waived by Brussels for Mr Deripaska’s Rusal firm.

Both men denied any wrongdoing in the deal. Mr Deripaska recently footed part of the bill for the Sochi Winter Olympics, amid international condemnation of the Kremlin’s crackdown on gay rights. Lord Mandelson did not respond yesterday to requests for a comment.

Yesterday in Ukraine, pro- Russian separatists in east Ukraine ignored Mr Putin’s public calls to postpone a referendum on independence, which many fear could spark a full-blown civil war.

Separatist leaders in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk want to split from the Ukraine.

Denis Pushilin, leader in Donetsk, said: ‘Civil war has already begun. The referendum can put a stop to it and start a political process.’ 

Mr Putin has called for the vote to be delayed to allow further talks with Kiev. He has also ordered  Russian troops to pull back from the border with Ukraine.

Some analysts believe the president knew that separatists would defy his call to postpone the votes.

By making his demands public, Russia could distance itself from criticism that it is stoking unrest.

Moscow has vowed to protect  the rights of Ukraine’s large Russian-speaking population. It describes the government in Kiev as undemocratic.
