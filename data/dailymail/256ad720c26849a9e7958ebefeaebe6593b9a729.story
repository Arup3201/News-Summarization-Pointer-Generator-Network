Disney’s timeless princesses and villains have captured the imagination of millions across the world.

But what would they look like if their exaggerated features were translated into real-life anatomy?

Israeli artist Karen Graw, who works under the name ‘Avalonis’, attempted to find out in this series of portraits.

From top left to right, then next rows: Rapunzel, Flynn Rider, Mother Gothel, Tiana, Charlottle LaBouffe, Esmeralda, Frollo, Quasimodo, Giselle, Jane, Tarzan,
Cinderella, Belle, Prince Adam, Gaston, Jafar, Mulan, Alice, Jasmine, Aladdin, Aurora, Prince Philip, Maleficent, Cruella, Meg, Hercules, Pocahontas, Snow White, The Evil Queen, Ariel, Prince Eric, Ursula

Ms Graw said she manipulated each photo until she got ‘the right features and made them real enough looking.’

She admitted to having some difficulty with ‘ridiculously proportioned Disney characters’ such as Hercules and Cruella de Vil.

The results, however, are surprisingly realistic and show just what a real-life Belle or Cinderella might look like if you bumped into them on the street.

These portraits were designed by Israeli artist Karen Graw. Below each portrait is the original character created by Disney. From top left clockwise: Prince Philip from Sleeping Beauty, Maleficent also from Sleeping Beauty, Cruella Deville from 101 Dalmations, Meg from Hercules, Ursula, Prince Eric and Ariel from the Little Mermaid

From top left clockwise: Esmeralda, Frollo, Quasimodo (all from the Hunchback of Notre-Dame) Jafa from Aladdin and Gaston and Prince Adam from Beauty and the Beast

From top left clockwise: Mulan, Alice from Alice in Wonderland, Jasmine from Aladdin, Pocahontas, Hercules and Meg from Hercules

From top left clockwise: Rapunzel, Flynn Rider from Rapunzel, Mother Gothe also from Rapunzel, Tarzan, Jane from Tarzan and Giselle from Enchanted

Despite these real-life representations, Disney's unrealistic proportions have repeatedly come under fire.

Only
 last month, Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland 
found that Disney tends to animate its typically-thin female 
protagonists even thinner when they are portrayed as the subject of 
romantic attention.

In
 looking at seven studies that survey average wrist sizes, Mr Cohen 
found ‘a range for women of 15.4 cm to 16.3 cm and for men of 17.5 cm to
 18.1 cm’.

A
 survey of U.S. Army members discovered that the average ratio of men’s 
to women’s wrist sizes weigh in at just 1.15-to-1. That correlation is 
not accurately depicted in Disney’s animations, he says.

Avalonis isn’t the only one who has attempted to bring Disney’s magic to life.

California-based
 photographer  Ryan Astamendi has also created incredible real-life 
versions of Disney princesses - and the likenesses are uncanny.

Mr
 Astamendi’s project, named 'the Princess Series', involved shooting 
real-life versions of his favourite Disney princesses one-by-one.

What is essential for the success of his work, he said, was a 'great costume, and a great model.'

‘I 
think the evidence suggests that Disney favours compositions in which 
women’s hands are tiny compared to men’s, especially when they are in 
romantic relationships,’ he said.

In Frozen, for instance, main character Anna’s wrists appear to be almost one third the size of Hans’s, her male love interest.

Snow White's beauty is reflected in the real princess's rosebud lips and peaches and cream complexion

Disney's unrealistic proportions have repeatedly come under fire. For instance, Anna, the protagonist of Frozen, has wrists that are smaller than her eyes
