The former boyfriend of a young mother stabbed her to death during a row over her son's christening and then went out drinking, before returning and sleeping in the same house. 

Liam King 26, from Eccles, in Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to the murder of ex-girlfriend Rebecca Ayres, 25, at Manchester Crown Court today and was sentenced to life imprisonment.

He will serve a minimum of 15 years before he is considered for parole.

The murder took place on March 5 after the couple's 18 month relationship turned sour because of his jealously.

During an argument about the ceremony of her son, Riley, King stabbed Miss Ayres to death at their shared house in Eccles, Greater Manchester, in a frenzied attack. 

Police were called the next day at about 9.15am after her father reportedly raised the alarm when he could get no response from the property.

Neighbours also reported hearing screams and shouts coming from the house. 

King only fled when he heard her father knocking on the door.  

The post-mortem examination revealed Miss Ayres died as a result of multiple stab wounds sustained during the attack.

On the day she was killed, Miss Ayres had been at the Dutton Arms pub in Eccles with her father to watch a football game, when King entered and shouted abuse at her before leaving again.

Miss Ayres explained to her father that she and King had split up hours earlier, although she insisted she did not understand why he was acting so aggressively towards her. 

After the game, Miss Ayres and her father walked to an address on Holt Street, Eccles, where she met a friend.

Her friend told her that should King become aggressive when she returned home, she was to come back to her house for refuge.

But that was the last time Miss Ayres was seen alive by anyone other than King.

When arrested, King admitted during interview that later that night he became involved in a domestic argument - then stabbed her several times in the chest and arms.

He said that he left Rebecca struggling for breath on the floor and when he returned shortly afterwards she had died.

He then spent the night at the address and only fled when he heard her father knocking on the door the next morning. 

After the case, Senior Investigating Officer Duncan Thorpe of Greater Manchester Police said: 'Liam King's actions have left a three-year-old little boy without a mother, parents without a daughter and a family and group of friends without a young woman that lived life with a smile on her face and brought joy to those she knew.

'The police investigation revealed that Liam King was very controlling and abusive towards Rebecca.

'This is another terrible reminder of how important it is that the victims of domestic abuse, or their friends and family members if they suspect someone is a victim, should come forward and report it to the police.'

Sacha Cooper, Senior Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West said: 'Liam King carried out a brutal attack with a knife on his partner of two years following an argument about whether he would be attending her son's christening a few days later.

'After the attack King made no effort to call emergency services, instead he left her body in the house and went out drinking. 

'Rebecca's concerned father called the police the following morning when he was not able to make contact with her, but tragically by this time it was too late.

'Liam King's callous and cowardly actions have left a young child without a mother and parents without their daughter.

'I would like to offer my condolences to Rebecca Ayres' family and friends, my thoughts are very much with them at this time.

'The CPS are dedicated to tackling domestic violence, which is a blight on our communities. We will continue to work with the police and other agencies to provide the best possible service to victims, and bring to justice those who commit such abhorrent offences.' 

In an emotional tribute Miss Ayres' family described her as a 'doting mum'.

She had worked as a clerk for a life assurance company and was  a member of The Monaco Morris Dancing troupe which performed at seaside holiday camps and other venues.

'Becks was our hard-working, ambitious and fun-loving princess who lived life to the full,' they said.

'She had a smile that would light up any room and the hearts of everyone she came into contact with.

'She was a special daughter, granddaughter, sister, cousin, aunty and friend to many. She was a doting mum to her three-year-old son, who was her life.

'This has had a devastating impact on us all, including the community in which she lived, especially the Monaco Morris Dancing Troupe, of which she was a member from a very early age.'
