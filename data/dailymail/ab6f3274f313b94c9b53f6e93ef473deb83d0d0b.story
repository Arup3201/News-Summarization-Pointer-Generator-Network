Strangers locking lips, a nun channelling Sister Act and a pet pup scaring the wits out of hapless strangers: these are the moments that got the world watching in 2014.

California-based video sharing site, YouTube, has released its annual list of global top-trending videos, chosen based on views, shares, comments and likes.

In the top spot for views was the aptly-titled Mutant Giant Spider Dog, which follows the adventures of a Polish dog dressed as a giant, furry arachnid as it bounds out of lifts and down dark alleyways.

Beware the Spider Dog: In the top spot for views was the aptly-titled Mutant Giant Spider Dog, which follows the adventures of a Polish dog dressed as a giant, furry arachnid as it bounds out of lifts and down alleyways

In one scene, a man taking out his rubbish flees for his life when Chica emerges from behind a door, while in another, two girls scream and run after seeing the creature atop a lifeless man in an elevator.

Later in the video, a couple spot a flinching man wrapped up in a 'spider web' hanging from a tree in a park and the man bravely creeps towards it, while his girlfriend stays rooted in her position. 

In a year in which the World Cup captivated audiences worldwide, a Nike advert starring the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar da Silva Santos Junior and Wayne Rooney also had fans clicking.

That video, Nike Football: Winner Stays, garnered just under 100 million views to rank second on YouTube's list.

Coming in third was First Kiss, a black and white number from filmmaker Tatia PIlieva, documented the moment perfect strangers kissed - watched on by 94 million people and counting. 

While most of the participants laugh nervously to fill the awkward silences before their kiss, many of them become passionately lost in the moment when they finally lean in. 

Rounding out the top four was a clip from the Italian version of reality talent search hit The Voice, in which a 25-year-old nun from Sicily earned a near-instant standing ovation from studio audiences for her rendition of Alicia Keys' anthem No One.

Sister Cristina Scuccia's audition tape has so far been watched by more than 66 million people.

The fifth most popular video was of the new iPhone 6 Plus put to the test by YouTube user Unbox Therapy, who uses his bare hands to test the bendability of the new model.

The problem, dubbed 'bend gate' by some on social media sites, was due to the phone's thinner aluminium exterior, and generated a number of viral spoofs.

Other videos to feature in the top ten include a 'devil baby' terrorising the streets of New York courtesty of the makers of new horror film Devil's Due.

The producers made a remote-controlled stroller containing a horrifying animatronic 'devil baby' that suddenly sits up and emits a demonic, blood-curdling wail when approached.

Passers-by are lured to the stroller by the sound of a baby crying. Then, when they're close, the Satanic occupant gives them the shock of their lives.

A more recent video, which came in at number 10, showed a 24-year-old aspiring actress filmed being catcalled 108 times as she strolled around New York City.

Shoshana Roberts, a graduate of Kutztown University in Pennsylvania, was captured on a hidden camera by her friend, Rob Bliss, as she walked through the city's streets.

Over a ten-hour period, she was pelted with dozens of unsolicited comments, including: 'What's up beautiful?', 'Hey baby', 'Smile' and 'Have a nice evening darling'.

Until recently, Facebook page owners shared their Youtube videos on their Facebook page. 

But for the first time ever, page owners are uploading more videos directly to Facebook than they did via sharing from YouTube videos, according to new data from Socialbakers.

The research found that YouTube's share of the videos posted to Facebook by content creators has been falling since May.

According to Business Insider, this is because marketers and content creators are starting to realise there is more value in publishing a video directly to Facebook than there is uploading it to YouTube alone.  

One benefit is that Facebook videos automatically play as a user scrolls through the news feed, which means users are drawn to content rather than having to press play based on the title.

Facebook also provides a large video preview image through the news feed than the smaller preview boxes offered on YouTube. 

The list reveals that there is no exact formula, but YouTube said popular videos tend to have three key characteristics. 

'They’re entertaining or informative in some way, they’re something that you want to share with other people, and they come from a channel with more videos like it,' said the site.

Meanwhile, more than 100 YouTube stars helped create YouTube Rewind: Turn Down for 2014, the latest in YouTube's series of year-end mash-ups.

With cameos from Japanese beatboxer Hikakin, Sesame Street stalwart Big Bird, and US talk show host Conan O'Brien, and set to the dulcet tones of Happy singer Pharrell Williams and Fancy rapper Iggy Azalea, YouTube says its 2014 effort is the most international so far.
