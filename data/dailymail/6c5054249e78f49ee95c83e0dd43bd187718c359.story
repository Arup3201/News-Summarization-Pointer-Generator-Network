Photographer Punam Dave had all the ingredients for a perfect landscape shot - the glorious blue sea, lush green trees and moss covered rock - until a rather surly looking baboon suddenly popped into her picture.

The surprise photobomber was one of a number of playful primates cavorting around at Cape Point, the southern tip of Cape Peninsula in South Africa, and putting on a show for tourists.

Ms Dave, a counsellor from Limpopo Province in northern South Africa, ignored the attention-hungry animals and began to set up a beautiful shot of the sparkling ocean - when a poker-faced baboon jumped into the frame.

Poser: The poker-faced baboon paused and apparently waited for photographer Punam Dave to take her shot of the famous Cape Point vista

With its arms outstretched and a surly look worthy of a catwalk model, the chacma baboon held the pose while waiting for the picture to be taken.

Punam, 24, said: 'I was actually busy setting up my camera to take a shot of Dias beach which you can see in the background when all of a sudden this baboon came and sat right in the middle of my view.

'I was actually quite surprised because these baboons are known to be quite aggressive and steal people's food.

'Instead it just sat there, posing for me, calm as ever.'

She added: 'It was literally for a few seconds and then it scampered away.

'There were lots of tourists standing next to me and we were having a good laugh about it - it was very unexpected.'

'It was an unique experience which is now one of my best memories at Cape Point.'

The baboon isn't the only fame-hungry animal wanting to have a snap taken, llamas, seals and even polar bears have also jumped in on the action.

And some have even managed to make it look like they've taken a selfie at the destination, as happened with a somewhat curious lemur and a smiling black macaque.
