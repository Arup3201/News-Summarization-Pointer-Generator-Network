A woman died after she was hit in the face by a mountain bike as she watched her boyfriend compete in a downhill race.

Judith Garrett, 29, was struck by a bike which flew into the crowd when a competitor crashed during the contest in Llangollen, North Wales.

She was airlifted to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent, but died the following day.

Family grief: As well as her boyfriend, Miss Garrett leaves behind her father Bill, mother Lorna and sister Jane

Miss Garrett had been due to move in to her first home with boyfriend Peter Walton, 31, two weeks after the incident on Sunday, August 31.

She had also recently been promoted at her work at a pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Her father, retired BT engineer and local councillor Bill Garrett, 66, said his ‘beautiful, loving’ daughter was at the bottom of the course waiting to watch her boyfriend, who is ranked 39th nationally by British Cycling in the ‘expert’ category.

But tragedy struck when another rider came off his bike and it catapulted into the crowd, hitting her directly. No one else was injured.

Speaking from his home in Prudhoe, Northumberland, Mr Garrett said: ‘We’re all still very much in a state of shock right now. I don’t know if anything like this ever sinks in.

‘A rider came down and came off his bike, which went flying through the air and right into the crowd of people watching.

‘It came down into the spectators but Judith was the only one who was hit.

‘She was unconscious and had suffered a really bad head injury. Her boyfriend didn’t see what happened but as soon as he got a message, he came down to her.

‘It just seems to have been a freak accident.’

All to live for: She had recently been promoted at work and was looking forward to moving into a new home

There was no room for Mr Walton, a manager for a pharmaceutical company, in the air ambulance, so he had to drive for an hour and a half to the hospital. Last night he was too upset to speak.

Mr Garrett and his wife Lorna, 64, arrived in time to say goodbye before their daughter passed away.

‘We went down as soon as we found out and thankfully at least we were able to be there with her at the end,’ he said.

Miss Garrett, whose grandfather Ted Garrett was the Labour MP for Wallsend from 1964 to 1992, regularly travelled from Mr Walton’s family home in Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, where the couple were staying, to support him in competitions. On the day of the Borderline Events UK Downhill Series competition, she had called her parents to tell them how beautiful the area was.

Miss Garrett's father said the death of his daughter would leave 'a huge void' in the lives of her family

The contest involved cyclists taking turns to complete the 2km route at speeds of up to 40mph. The first section of the course was described as so steep ‘it was vertical’ in a biking blog earlier this year.

The event was nearly finished at the time of the incident at 5.30pm and was stopped afterwards.

A British Cycling spokesman said: ‘British Cycling treats the safety of competitors and spectators as the highest priority and we will be conducting a full investigation.’

An inquest into Miss Garrett’s death was opened on Monday and adjourned until January.
