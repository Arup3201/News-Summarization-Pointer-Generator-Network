Tottenham Hotspur are maintaining a keen interest in Cologne defender Kevin Wimmer.

The 22-year-old Austrian centre back has been watched several times this season and Mauricio Pochettino has received glowing reports as they ponder a summer deal.

The Bundesliga club's sporting director Jorg Schmadtke recently conceded that Wimmer may be sold at the end of the season, providing that their valuation of the Austria U21 international is met.
