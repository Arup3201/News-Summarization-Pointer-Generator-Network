A Texas teenager who was battling cancer was shot dead outside his home over the weekend.

Witnesses said that Duncanville middle school student Ryan Lara was moving his parents' car from the street to their driveway on Saturday when someone tried to rob him, then opened fire.

It has been reported that three shots were fired, with one hitting Lara in the back. Family members rushed from the house after hearing the shooting and saw a gray or silver four door sedan speed away.

MyFoxdfw.com reports that Lara's brother, Brandon, shot at the car with his own gun, but it is not known if any bullets struck the vehicle. 

He said: 'I ran out, stepped over him and proceeded to pull out my pistol with my left hand and started firing at the vehicle with no headlights or no lights on.

Police aren't sure if more than one person is responsible for Lara's death but have offered up to $5,000 for the indictment of those involved. 

Lara, who was a seventh grade student at Byrd Middle School, noticed a lump in his chest two months ago that was later diagnosed as lymphoma. He had surgery to remove it and had just started chemotherapy.

Seven years earlier Lara was struck an emotional blow when his mother died, something that caused him to be held back at school. 

Brandon said his brother, who was a wide receiver for his school's football team, was 'very loveable'.  

Lara's family wants the person or people in that sedan to come forward.

Brandon said: 'He didn't deserve this and I just hope whoever killed him...what's done in the dark is soon going to come to the light.'

Duncanville ISD informed their students of Lara's death by letter and grief counselors were at the school on Monday.
