A drug smuggler was caught carrying £180,000 of cocaine stuffed in her huge 46D bra.

Nola Williams, 47, was found with the stash after she arrived at Gatwick on a BA flight from Kingston, Jamaica, with a child and accomplice Raymond Goodison in January last year.

But despite being on licence for a previous jail sentence for drugs, Goodison was bailed and has since fled the country.

Busted: Williams stashed a 1kg of high purity cocaine in her 46D bra - worth almost £200,000 at street value

The pair were arrested as they boarded a train from the airport to Victoria station in central London.

A strip search revealed a kilogram of cocaine stitched into the cups of Williams' bra.

Goodison had used the woman as a 'mule' the court heard, as he was sentenced to 13 years in his absence. It is believed that he may now be in Jamaica or the US.

He was convicted of smuggling cocaine while Williams pleaded guilty to the same charge.

Judge Jeffery Blackett, sentencing Goodison at Croydon Crown Court, said: 'This man Raymond Goodison was, effectively, charged with importing over a kilo of cocaine into this country.

'He used Miss Williams, there's no doubt about that, so she could sew the drugs into her bra.

'She came through customs, with a child and then the offence was discovered.'

He continued: 'There's no doubt I can infer, that he played a leading role in this drug importation.

Defence: Williams claims she is not a drug smuggler but a victim of human trafficking and is yet to be sentenced. Above, the cocaine found in her bra

'He was convicted before and he was sentenced to ten years for a similar offence and he recently had been involved in the supply of drugs.

'He was a man who was said to be unemployed but had significant assets.'

He added that the money would have come from drug dealing.

Williams, of Stockwell, south London, was also due to be sentenced.

However, her barrister insisted that she had been a victim of human trafficking, so the judge adjourned her sentencing to allow more evidence to be gathered about the claims.

Sentencing Goodison, Judge Blackett continued: 'He was on license for his most recent drugs offence, the drugs were of high purity and he was using Miss Williams, whatever her status, as a mule.

'She was with a child when she came through Gatwick.'

He continued: 'The prosecution are correct to say there is no mitigation for this offence.'

During Goodison's trial, prosecutor Louis French said: 'The amount we are talking about is nearly a kilo of quite high quality, about 71 per cent purity and that 973g would, if it were sold on the street, would be worth about £180,000.

Williams was able to get through customs with the drugs stuffed in her bra (as seen above) but was arrested as she attempted to board a train from Gatwick Airport

Seized: The 46D bra was also stuffed with foam padding. The cocaine was stored in plastic bags in each cup

'How was it smuggled in? It was concealed about the clothing of a woman who had arrived from Jamaica, more precisely Kingston, in the Caribbean, which is close to South America.

'That woman, who is Nola Williams, and she travel to this country through Gatwick Airport and had with her a young child.'

When they arrived Williams and Goodison went into the baggage reclaim area separately and only spoke to each other on the shuttle from the North Terminal to the South Terminal.

They were both arrested by officers from the National Crime Agency as they went through the ticket to barrier to board a Gatwick Express train to Victoria Station.

Mr French said: 'While she was being searched by an officer, the stash of cocaine was detected, concealed in the bra, stitched in the cups of her garment.'

Goodison claimed to have met Williams at Kingston Airport and denied flying together.

However, analysis of their phones shows they were in regular contact in the UK in December 2013 before the flight back from Jamaica.

In a statement forensic scientist, Fraser Johnson, said he was asked to examine 'a size 46 D bra, which weighed 1,142g.'

He added: 'Inside the bra there were two plastic bags in each cup, and those plastic bags held a white powder which was found to be cocaine.'

Goodison, of Northolt, Middlesex, has previous convictions for importing 637g of cocaine in 1991 when he sentenced to ten years and possession with intent to supply heroin in 2009 when he was jailed for five years.

He was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment in his absence. The judge also ordered that the drugs be forfeited and destroyed and ordered Goodison to pay a £120 victim surcharge.

Describing William's claims that she was a victim of human trafficking, prosecutor Sean Sullivan said: 'Her representatives have conversed with the prosecution and the Home Office on the issue that she may be a victim of human trafficking.'

He added that an officer from the Home Office had looked into the claim but added, ' [He] came to the conclusion that Miss Williams is not a victim of human trafficking.'

However, he added: 'The situation appears to be this - the defence do not accept that finding at present and wish to obtain expert assistance in dealing with that issue.'

Adjourning her sentencing to a date to be set, Judge Blackett said: 'I'm not going to sentence you today because inquiries need to be made into your assertion that you have been subjected to human trafficking.'
