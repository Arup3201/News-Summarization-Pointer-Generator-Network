The BBC has called in external auditors to widen the search for excessive severance payoffs made to its senior executives, it emerged last night.

The corporation’s director general Tony Hall told staff in an internal email he has ordered KPMG to look at deals made to departing staff prior to 2010 to get to the bottom of the severance pay scandal.

The National Audit Office is investigating the files of 90 senior managers handed golden goodbyes in the past three years to see if they breached contractual limits.

Questions: The BBC is under pressure over the scale of severance payments to senior managers

Its devastating report found the BBC handed its staff £369million over eight years, but only looked in detail at the most recent cases.

The KPMG review means even more high-profile deals could come under scrutiny, including a £500,000 payoff to former BBC1 controller Peter Fincham in 2007.

He resigned in disgrace after he was criticised for making false claims about doctored footage of the Queen. Lord Hall has already asked for a ‘detailed briefing’ into his payoff, although the BBC has not yet confirmed whether it will publish what he is told.

Another historic payoff likely to come under the spotlight is a six-figure sum handed to Lesley Douglas, a former controller of Radio 2 who resigned over the ‘Sachsgate’ scandal involving Russell Brand and Jonathan Ross.

Many BBC staff on lower salaries are understood to be furious at the high severance payments.

In his email to staff yesterday, Lord 
Hall tried to boost morale, saying: ‘I know this issue has provoked a 
very strong reaction from many of you and I understand why you feel that
way.

Lord Hall was yesterday accused of attempting to keep an internal inquiry into one controversial payoff secret. 

He ordered workers to brief  him verbally about a deal to award former BBC1 controller Peter Fincham £500,000 in 2007, meaning that the results would not be published.

He is now reportedly reconsidering his decision after being asked whether the BBC was trying to prevent the release of information which could embarrass them. 

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The format of the presentation of the information is yet to be confirmed.’

'It is worth saying however that severance pay in general was part 
of an attempt to reduce senior management numbers, and in the process we
did save £35m which went back into programme-making and will continue 
to do so at a rate of £19m a year as we move forwards.

‘However, it is clear this was not 
done in accordance with best practice – that is why we have already 
tightened up procedures and also why we will not contemplate this level 
of payoff in the future, even though senior posts will continue to 
decline in number.’

Yesterday, it was revealed the 
Metropolitan Police are assessing whether to investigate BBC staff over 
allegations of misconduct in public office as a result of the scandal. 
Lord Hall said he had ‘not had any approaches from the police on this 
matter’.

A BBC spokesman would not comment on which specific deals KPMG is likely to look at. Findings will be published on September 9.
