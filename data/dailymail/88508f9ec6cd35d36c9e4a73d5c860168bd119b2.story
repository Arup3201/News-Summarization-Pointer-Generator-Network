A BMW driver and an accomplice are believed to be deliberately injuring cyclists by pushing them off their bikes before driving away.

Three cyclists from Leicestershire have reported being forced from their bikes by an old-style silver BMW in three separate incidents in less than a week.

Police are now investigating the recent spate of attacks - the latest victim was left with a broken collarbone when he was forced off the road on Saturday afternoon.Â 

The lorry driver from Stoney Stanton broke his collarbone as he came off his bike at 25mph and has to take 12 weeks off work

All three cyclists reported that a silver BMW had driven up to them before each incident - two of the cyclists said a passenger in the car reached out and pushed them.

Andy Limb, 55, was riding his bike at about 25mph during a training run in Croft on Saturday afternoon when a BMW car swerved and slowed to his speed.

'The car pulled up alongside and then dived into me, forcing me on to the gravel and sending me over the handlebars,' he told the Leicester Mercury.

'I didn't really hear him coming and I didn't see who was in the car because they appeared from behind,' he said.

The lorry driver from Stoney Stanton broke his collarbone as he came off his bike at 25mph - he has to take 12 weeks off work and can't attend a cycling holiday in France.

'There is a big cycling community around here and all of them are now very nervous. Now every time they get on a bike they are looking over their shoulder,' he told The Independent.

Two days earlier Martin Webster, who runs a bicycle shop in Wigston, was also attacked.

'Somebody from the car pushed me on to quite a deep grass verge,' he told the BBC.

'I was going quite fast, doing about 30mph and I went flying over the handlebars.

'I don't think they realise the seriousness of what could happen. I could have had a broken neck.'

Mr Webster suffered bruising and grazing to his leg and shoulder.

Last Monday Colin Haynes, 48, from North Kilworth, was cycling home after work along at about 4pm when he experienced a similar attack.

He fell from his bike after a silver BMW pulled up next to him, and the passenger leaned out and pushed him.

'They need to be caught because someone 
could so easily be killed. You wouldn't jump out of a car at 15 or 20 
miles-an-hour, and this is the same thing,' Mr Limb said.

A Leicestershire Police spokeswoman said: 'We are taking these reports very seriously. Investigations are on-going and we have made an appeal for witnesses. Officers are aware of the incidents and their similarities.'
