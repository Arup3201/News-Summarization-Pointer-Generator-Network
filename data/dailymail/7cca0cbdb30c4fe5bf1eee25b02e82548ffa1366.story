Every family in Britain is propping up the public sector pension scheme by £1,000 every year, David Cameron revealed as he called on thousands of civil servants, teachers and lecturers to quit Friday's planned strikes.

About 750,000 public sector workers - about one in eight - are expected to walk out of their jobs tomorrow in protest against the Government's pension reforms.

Government offices will shut, and nine in 10 schools are expected to close in some parts of the country disrupting the lives of millions.

The cost of public sector pensions is the equivalent of £1,000 for every family in Britain David Cameron revealed

But speaking at a local government 
conference in Birmingham yesterday, the Prime Minister said his 
controversial pension reform plans were a "good deal" which would enable
 affordable pensions to be secured for millions of public sector workers
 for years to come.

He said it was not fair that the
 public purse contributed more than two thirds of the cost of 
maintaining the public sector pensions - the equivalent of £1,000 per 
household, according to the Daily Telegraph.

Mr Cameron insisted change was necessary and the whole system was at risk
 of going broke if it continued as it is.

Pension reform is part of the government's effort to effectively wipe out a record budget deficit by 2015.

Like other European governments, the Conservative-led coalition says reform is needed to make pensions affordable when people are living longer.

Workers will pay more money into their pension savings and have to stay in their jobs for longer. Pensions will no longer be based on a worker's final salary before retirement.

Mr Cameron said about 50 per cent of the public service pensioners receive less than £6,000 a year

Today, if a public sector worker retires
 at 60, they can claim a pension for nearly 30 years, as opposed to 20 
years in the 1970s.

Hitting back at critics who say public service pensions are too 
generous, the Prime Minister said about 50 per cent of the public service pensioners 
receive less than £6,000 a year. 

Free market think tank Reform said Mr Cameron needed to 
reform the public sector pensions as the country was facing a "bleak 
future" of rising taxes and rising deficit, the newspaper reported.

A report by the think tank said pensions and health care will soar by £72billion a year by 2041.

In a plea to workers planning to strike tomorrow, Mr Cameron said: ''In a democracy, people can go out and protest. But the people marching should know what they're objecting to, and I believe there are some misconceptions flying around.'

'So to those considering strike action, at a time when discussions are ongoing, I would say to you: these strikes are wrong -- for you, for the people you serve, for the good of the country. It's the changes we propose that are right.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband agreed the strikes were a mistake but accused the coalition government of "botching" reform.

Disruption: Thousands of teachers are set to take industrial action

Yesterday, it was revealed the cost of paying teachers’ pensions last 
year was £7billion – and by 2015 it is expected to rise to £10billion.

The average pension for teachers retiring at their normal pension age is around £10,300.

But that figure includes many teachers with shorter careers, including some with just a few years’ service.

A teacher retiring at their normal pension age after spending their whole career in the profession, with between 35 and 40 years of service, can on average expect to receive a pension of around £24,000.

In addition, teachers who entered the scheme before 2007 receive an automatic lump sum worth three times their annual pension – so on average, £72,000.

A secondary head teacher could expect to receive £42,000 a year, with a lump sum of £126,000.

To enjoy such benefits in the private sector, you would need a pension pot of over £1.5million, ten times the average.

The average pension in the UK is just £3,900 a year, which represents a pension pot of just £150,000.

When the teachers’ pension scheme started, members put in the same as the taxpayer –  5 per cent of salary each.

Today, members pay 6.4 per cent of salary in contributions, with employers contributing more than double that, at 14.1 per cent.

For teachers working in the state sector, the employer contribution is met from funding provided by Government.

The Treasury – and therefore the taxpayer – must meet the cost of any gap between the combined contribution of employees and employers and the cost of paying pensions.

Surprisingly, private school teachers also qualify for a public sector pension, ostensibly so that teachers can move easily between the independent and state sectors.
