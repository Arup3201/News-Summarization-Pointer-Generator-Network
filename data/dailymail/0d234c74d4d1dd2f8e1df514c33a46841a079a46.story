Three members of a Russian feminist punk band have
 gone on trial in Moscow today after staging an anti-Putin
protest in the country's biggest cathedral.

The band, called 'Pussy Riot,' face seven years in jail after briefly seizing part of the Cathedral Of Christ the Saviour and chanting 'Mother Mary, drive Putin away.'

The performance, which was posted on You Tube, has deeply divided Russian society and angered the powerful Russian Orthodox Church which condemned it as 'blasphemous.'

Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 23, Maria 
Alekhina, 24, and Yekaterina Samutsevich, 29 wore homemade, brightly 
coloured ski masks and mini-skirts for the prank.

The You Tube video of their performance shows churchgoers looking astonished as the women chant, high-kick and
 dance, and then bow and bless themselves as security guards 
arrive to remove them.

Their trial has begun in Moscow's Khamovniki district court, which was surrounded by dozens of riot policemen, along with the band's supporters and critics.

The band members were arrested after their anti-Putin protest in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow in February

The video of their performance has became an internet hit.

The band's 'punk prayer' took place two 
weeks before March's presidential vote in which Mr Putin won a third 
term despite a wave of massive protests against his rule.

Their cause and the Russian Orthodox 
Church's harsh response to their actions have provoked public outcry and
 deeply polarised Russia.

The church said the women deserve to be 
prosecuted for their performance because it took place in a place where no lay people are allowed to enter - although thousands of 
believers have signed a petition urging the church to forgive the band.

Pussy Riot gained notoriety in January 
for performing a song entitled 'Putin Chickens Out' in Red 
Square at a spot where government decrees were announced in czarist Russia.
