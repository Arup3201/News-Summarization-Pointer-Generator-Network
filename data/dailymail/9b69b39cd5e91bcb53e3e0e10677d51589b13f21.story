Britain is recovering today after celebrating the busiest night of the Christmas party season and the year's booziest evening.

Revellers across the country donned their party outfits to celebrate 'Mad Friday' last night as many offices closed for the festive period.

Police forces brought in extra officers to cope with demand and hospitals were on high alert as Britons put their health and safety at risk by opting for one drink too many.

Elsewhere in Birmingham, groups of friends showed off their ostentatious variety of festive jumpers. 

One reveller in London took the seasonal attire to the next level, with a full red Christmas themed suit covered in snowmen and Christmas trees. 

Last year, sales of alcohol soared by 114 per cent on Mad Friday compared with an average Friday in 2013.  

Police forces up and down the country brought in extra officers to cope with the demand in busy city centres.

In Manchester alone between 150,000 to 200,000 people  rolled in to town for a boozy shindig.

In Cardiff, there is a temporary triage unit in the city centre, while there is a help point in Swansea.

Police and ambulance crews urged people to take care when out drinking. 

Humberside Police said: 'The festive period is a great time to socialise with friends and work colleagues in the run-up to Christmas.

'Unfortunately, these nights can lead to revellers drinking excessively which leaves them vulnerable to becoming victims of crime and occasionally leading to serious assaults and sexual assaults.'

Street pastors are turning to social media in an effort to use it as a force for good during party season.

Christian Nightlife Initiatives have launched a #StaySafe campaign reminding revellers of responsible drinking and appropriate behaviour.

Festive shoppers are expected to spend £1.2billion today as panic buyers  hit the stores on 'Panic Saturday'.

Some of the country's biggest high street names have slashed prices for what is expected to be one of the busiest shopping days of the year.

Around 13 million consumers will spend £2.1million for every minute the shops are open on last-minute gifts and groceries at an average of £92.31 per person, according to a report by the Centre for Retail Research (CRR).

Debenhams is selling some Christmas gifts at half-price, Boots is offering a 60 per cent discount of selected fragrances and Marks & Spencer has knocked 50 per cent off the price of some beauty products. 

Britain's department stores can expect to double their takings this weekend, with outlets in the north of England set to benefit the most from Panic Saturday, according to data from Worldpay.
