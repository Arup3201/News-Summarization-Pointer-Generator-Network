ITV Sport, having lost their FA Cup and live Champions League and Europa League rights, will not be renewing the contracts of pundit Andy Townsend and presenter Matt Smith at the end of the season.

The decision was mutual with Townsend, one of the best operators in the difficult role of co-commentator.

He wants to work on live football and has offers from other international broadcasters.

However, shedding football personnel doesn’t say much about ITV’s ambitions to take Match of the Day highlights off the BBC in the Premier League TV rights auction next month.

Townsend will leave ITV having spent nearly 15 years with the broadcaster as a pundit, co-commentator and analyst.

The 51-year-old former Aston Villa, Chelsea and Middlesbrough midfielder is currently ITV's leading co-commentator, summarising alongside Clive Tyldesley for England matches - including at major tournaments - and Champions League games.

He was also part of the channel's coverage of the Premier League between 2001 and 2004.

The former Republic of Ireland midfielder reviewed highlights of matches on ITV's The Premiership from a trailer outside the studio during a segment called 'Townsend's Tactics Truck'.
