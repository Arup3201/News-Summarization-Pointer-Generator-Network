It looks like a scene from a magical kingdom with fog snaking between the mountains like a river.

The fog, which stretches through the mountains for around 200 miles, was photographed from a helicopter by landscape photographer Victor Liu, who described the scene as being like 'a paradise'.

The low clouds have actually settled between the southern continental ranges of the Canadian Rockies, where the tallest mountain - Mount Assiniboine - stands at 11,870ft high.

Breathtaking: Photographer Victor Liu took a set of amazing photographs of clouds nestling snake-like in the Canadian Rockies

The long game: Mr Liu estimated that the clouds wound their way through the mountains for about 200 miles

On cloud nine: The amazing scene was shot from a helicopter flying about 8,000 feet from the ground

Feeling peaky: The tallest mountain in the Canadian Rockies stands at a lofty 11,870ft high - but these clouds were nestled about 6,500ft up

The rare view was taken from 8,000 to 8,500ft high with the fog nestling in between the mountains, which sit on the Alberta and British Columbia border, in Canada, 5,000 to 6,500ft from the ground.

Mr Liu, 35, said: 'I felt like I was flying above a magical kingdom or another planet.

'Even the pilot was shocked by the scene, because he had rarely flown under such weather conditions.

'It felt like being in a paradise with no civilization, but only miles and miles of beautiful landscape.'

'I especially love these pictures because they show a unique view of the Canadian Rockies, which I have been shooting from the ground for years, but only occasionally from the air.

Impressed: The scene was so fantastical that even the helicopter pilot was amazed by it, according to Mr Liu

Heavenly: After witnessing the clouds Mr Liu said 'it felt like being in a paradise with no civilization, but only miles and miles of beautiful landscape'

Blanket coverage: The clouds almost completely covered the valley floor in some areas

Time well spent: The photographs were taken during Mr Liu's two-and-a-half hour helicopter ride

'With these low clouds, the mountain tops look like it's floating in the sky, it feels like something from a magic kingdom or on another planet.

'The rising sun cast amazing colours on the clouds and mountains. It showcased the beauty of our earth, definitely a lovely place to live.

'As a fine art landscape photographer, this is exactly what I am looking to photograph.'

Mr Liu, who emigrated to Calgar, Alberta, in Canada, from China around 12 years ago, took a two-and-a-half hour helicopter ride to snap the incredible photos.

He said: 'The helicopter's side window was open, and we were flying about 8,000 to 8,500ft high.

'We were in Kananaskis Country, in Alberta, Canada, specifically in Mount Assiniboine provincial park in British Columbia, and Banff National Park, in Alberta, in Canada.

'The fog or low clouds were between the southern continental ranges of the Canadian Rockies.

'The low clouds  went on for about 200 miles.'
