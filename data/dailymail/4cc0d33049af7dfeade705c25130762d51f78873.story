Chinese zoo keepers managed to save the life of a mentally disturbed man after he announced he wanted to improve the lives of caged tigers at a local zoo by offering them his own body to eat.

Yang Jinhai, 27, had posted several online messages about how optimistic he was about starting a new life after getting a job as a security guard in Chengdu in southwest China's Sichuan province.

But he quickly found the job boring and monotonous and moved instead to a job in a printing factory where he also then resigned, saying that he felt there was more to life.

After going to the local zoo he wrote 
how depressing it was to see the ‘noble and magnificent tigers’ living 
in such humble surroundings, where they were caged and unable to follow 
their natural instincts to hunt and kill.

He then announced that he had decided to sacrifice himself in order to provide the Bengal tigers with support.

Eyewitness
 Feng Lin said: ‘He climbed up the outside of the cage and jumped inside
 expecting, I assume, that the tigers would pounce on him. Instead the 
two tigers, a male and a female, seemed more nervous than anything else 
and the female actually ran off.

‘He
 then tried to antagonise the tigers by pulling faces at them. 
Eventually he was attacked by the male where he was cut after being 
scratched and bitten before he could be rescued by zoo keepers who fired
 a tranquilliser dart at the male tiger.’

They then pulled the man out of the cage.

Yang's
 family told local media Mr Jinhai had been depressed for a long time 
and said that he had been taken to a home where he was given psychiatric
 counselling to cope with his problems.
