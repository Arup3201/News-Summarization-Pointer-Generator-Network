From curses etched in lead to lucky rabbit feet, magical charms have long given insights into the superstitions of ancient cultures.

Now, a 1,500-year-old amulet has been unearthed in southwest Cyprus that bears a palindrome inscription, that reads the same backwards as it does forwards.

Its discovery suggests that some people continued to place their faith in ancient gods and superstitions in a bid to protect themselves, despite old beliefs being quashed by the Romans.

A 1,500-year-old amulet has been unearthed in southwest Cyprus that bears a palindrome inscription (pictured), which reads the same backwards as it does forwards. It translates as: ‘Iahweh (a god) is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of Re secure in his shrine’

The amulet was found in the ancient city of Nea Paphos and the inscription translates as: ‘Iahweh (a god) is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of Re secure in his shrine,’ Livescience reported. 

It is not the first ancient artefact bearing a palindrome to be discovered. 

Similarly, Roman lead ‘curse tablets' have been recovered in Bath, for example, which include magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency. Palindromes were possibly used with a similar intention.

As well as the inscription, the amulet features images including a bandaged mummy, thought to represent Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife and reincarnation, and Harpocrates, the god of silence, who is seen holding a finger to his lips, while sitting on a stool.

The protective charm also has a mythical dog-headed creature called a cynocephalus etched into it, who is mimicking Harpocrates.

As well as the inscription, the amulet features images including a bandaged mummy, thought to represent the Egyptian god of the afterlife and reincarnation, Osiris, and Harpocrates (depicted here on a Roman pillar), the god of silence, who is seen holding a finger to his lips, while sitting on a stool

The inscription on the amulet, found in the ancient city of Nea Paphos in Cyprus, translates as: ‘Iahweh (a god) is the bearer of the secret name, the lion of Re secure in his shrine.’

It was written as a palindrome, which reads the same backwards as it does forwards.

There are two small mistakes in the inscription. 

The 1,500-year-old amulet also bears unusual drawings on the other side.

It features images including a bandaged mummy, thought to represent the Egyptian god of the afterlife and reincarnation, Osiris and Harpocrates, the god of silence, who is seen holding a finger to his lips, while sitting on a stool.

It is unclear exactly why the images or precise words were chose, but amulets were believed to protect their owners from harm.

The unusual object was discovered in 2011 in the ancient agora – a meeting place – in Nea Paphos, by archaeologists from the Institute of Archaeology at Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland.

Professor Joachim Śliwa, of the university, wrote that there are two small mistakes in the palindrome, in the study published in the journal, Studies in Ancient Art and Civilisation.

The scribe accidentally wrote ‘p’ instead of ‘v’ on two occasions.

At the time the amulet was made, Cyprus was part of the Eastern Roman Empire, or Byzantine Empire.

Its official religion was Christianity and pagan practices were increasingly clamped down upon. 

Despite this, people, such as the owner of this amulet, carried on practicing old believes and superstitions.

A mosaic dating from the seventh century AD was also found to have pagan elements in it.

Leader of the excavation, Professor Ewdoksia Papuci-Wladyka, said that it seems that Christian and pagan religions coexisted in Paphos. 

However, the pagan drawings on the amulet suggest that its scribe was not over familiar with the mythological animals that he drew.

Drawings on the amulet suggest that its scribe was not over familiar with the mythological animals that he drew. Professor Śliwa wrote that details may be based on Egyptian sources, but are not drawn with much skill.

Professor Śliwa wrote that the animals may be based on Egyptian sources, but are not drawn with much skill and have unusual details.

For example, he explained that Harpocrates should be sitting on a lotus flower, not a stool, while cynocephalus should not be mimicking the god of silence.

He told LiveScience: ‘[In] the classic version, the cynocephalus faces Harpocrates with paws raised in adoration.’

Cross-hatched lines across the two character’s bodies, also suggests that the scribe thought they were mummified, which is incorrect in the case of Harpocrates.

A collection of 130 ancient 'curse tablets' featuring gruesome messages of revenge was added to the World Heritage register in June 2014.

They include wishes that thieves should go blind and mad, while cheaters become as 'liquid as water.'

The nasty messages – known as curse tablets - were written on pieces of lead by victims of theft or wrong doing, and were tossed into the hallowed spring waters in Bath, Somerset.

Artefacts bearing palindromes have been discovered in the ancient world. Similarly, Roman lead ‘curse tablets' (pictured) have been recovered in Bath, for example, which include magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency

Some messages included magical words and symbols, or were written back to front to increase the curse's potency. Others were pierced with nails to achieve a similar result.

A total of 130 of the artefacts unearthed at the Roman Baths have been deemed so precious they have been added to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) 'Memory of the World' register of outstanding documentary heritage.

In what could be the Roman version of modern-day trolling, the authors poured bile on their enemies and called for revenge in the most gruesome ways.

One tablet asks for an adversary's intestines to be ‘quite eaten away’, while another one reveals that the victim of a theft of a bronze vessel wanted the cup to be filled with the thief’s blood.

The curses, which date back between the 2nd and 4th century AD, are mostly written in Latin on pieces of lead and pewter and are addressed to the goddess Sulis Minerva.

They were cast into the hot springs at Bath, where they were left for the goddess, who was worshiped by Celts and Romans and believed to dispense justice.
