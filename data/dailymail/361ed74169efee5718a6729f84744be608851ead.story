This cottontail rabbit looks desperate to get back to the warmth of his warren as he dashes through six inch deep snow.

The furry mammal was snapped as he kicked up his heels and bounded up a hill towards the cover of a nearby forest.

Photographer Justin Russo, 27, captured the creature's run for cover in New Hamburg, Ontario, Canada.

This cottontail rabbit didn't let sub-zero temperatures stop him frolicking about in six-inch deep snow

Mr Russo, who lives in nearby Waterloo, said: 'The snow was about 6 inches deep at the time and the temperature was around -5C.

'I had to guess which way the rabbit would run as it faced up a hill towards a forest.

'I assumed it would make its way to the safety of the trees and I was correct.

'The rabbit took off extremely fast up the slope in a straight line right towards the forest, like I anticipated.

The chilly rabbit quickly made his way to the cover of a nearby forest, no doubt trying make it to his cosy warren

'I was amazed how fast it was and how fluid its stride was.

'When I looked back at my shots and saw that I had captured it in full stride and with its hind legs in front, I was impressed.

'They really show what this animal is capable of.

'I feel priviliged to have seen this rabbit enjoying its own environment and it seemed to love feeling free in the great outdoors.'
