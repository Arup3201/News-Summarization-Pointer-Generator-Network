It might not be the proudest achievement on his extensive list of accolades, but Justin Bieber has become the latest edition to the celebrity mugshot hall of fame

The head of Justin Bieber’s record label has revealed his concerns over the teenage pop star’s wild behaviour, claiming the singer needs an ‘intervention’.

Lucian Grainge, the chairman of Universal Music Group, admitted that the star needs help following months of wayward behaviour which finally saw the 19-year-old arrested last week in the US.

The 53-year-old music mogul said Bieber’s manager Scooter Braun had flown over to Panama to try and help the star while he was on holiday.

He said: ‘I’m very concerned about him. I’ve been concerned about him for many months. And Scooter Braun, who I work with very closely and who is supposed to be here but is with him at the moment.

‘This has nothing to do with the business or records or releases. This is to do with the young man.

‘He needs help. He needs an intervention. We are going to give all the support as a company to take as much pressure off him so he can look forward. Hopefully, we will all get through to him. But what people don’t understand is, he’s a 19-year-old.

'You cannot just pick someone up and force them to do something if they are not ready.

‘I think that emotionally, the public or people will see someone’s behaviour and think: “This is what I would do”.

‘All of us around him need to take all the responsibility, all the pressure off him and give him as much support so he can to address the issues he has - and he does have issues. And, I’d like it to be dealt with.’

It was last week that Bieber was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs.

Police said the star had been drag racing a rented yellow Lamborghini at twice the speed limit on a Miami Beach street. He was also charged with resisting arrest and having an expired driving licence.

The incident is the latest in a string of problems for the troubled star.

In March last year, he came on stage two hours late at a concert, and later screamed at a photographer and had to be restrained by his own minders. That same month, a neighbour near to his Los Angeles home claimed Bieber spat at him and even threatened to kill him.

In November, he and a friend spent more than three hours in a Rio de Janeiro brothel and he was photographed creeping out under a bed sheet.

He was later charged with vandalism after he was caught spraying graffiti reading ‘Beliebers 4 life’ on a hotel wall. In January, a neighbour accused Bieber and his friends of hurling eggs at his home, an ‘unprovoked attack’.
