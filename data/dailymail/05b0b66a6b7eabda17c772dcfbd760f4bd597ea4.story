It's a phrase you never stop hearing: the modern woman can have it all.  

But for one in four women aged 45 or over in Britain, one thing they will never have is a family of their own. 

Helen Burke, 39, from Basingtoke tried for a baby for 15 years: from the age of 22, all she wanted to do was have children. 

Fifteen years on and ten rounds of IVF later, she started going though the early menopause aged just 37, ending her dreams of ever becoming a mother.

Having family is one of most women's priorities, but soon one in four will reach 45 without having a baby (posed by model)

Helen put off going to university in order to start a family straight after getting married, with her main aim in life being having a brood of children living under her roof. 

The thought of it never happening had never even occurred to her. 

She told MailOnline: 'I spent 15 years in a baby bubble, it was all I ever thought about. 

'My whole life was focused on having a baby, when I wasn't having treatment I lived my life in four week cycles. 

'I stayed in really dull jobs because of the maternity benefits they would offer, I lived extremely healthily. 

'I tried various different fertility drugs, I also tried herbal Chinese teas, which were foul. 

'I was told that cough medicine might help, so I took that even when I didn't have a cough. 

'Anything somebody said, I would try.' 

Struggling to conceive can place serious strain on a couple's relationship (posed by model). Helen Burke believes the problems affected her first marriage, she said: 'Not being able to have children certainly wasn't the only reason that we broke up, but it definitely had an impact.' 

The strain of trying for a baby didn't just impact on Helen's own emotional health - she and her first husband divorced when was 30. 

She said: 'This is my second marriage. I was first married at 22 and we started trying for children immediately, but then we were divorced by 30. 

'Not being able to have children certainly wasn't the only reason that we broke up, but it definitely had an impact, especially when all of our family and friends were having children. 

'Then I started another relationship at 32, which was with is the man I am now married to. 

'So we only went through five years of trying for a child together.' 

During the 15 years of trying, like most women who are struggling to conceive, Helen's situation was made more difficult by several other factors in her life, including her friends having babies, but also the comments and questions about her struggle that came from well-meaning individuals. 

She said: "We're really lucky in that we've been really open with our friends, so they're great, but that's not to say it hasn't been hard at times.

'There were always conversations that would crop up with people who wanted to know why I didn't have children yet. 

'We call them "Bingos" at Gateway Women - the community for childless women that she attends - Bingos are the same conversations that you have with lots of people. 

'People try to be helpful and discuss the issue, but you just get the same questions over and over again. 

Even when women have overcome the upset of being unable to conceive, the stress and emotions can rise again when their friends and family members become grandmothers. 

'They think that you haven't considered a whole load of things, when of course you have - it's all you think about. 'Things like, have you thought about adoption? Of course!' 

Then two years ago, Helen was given the news she had been dreading - that she would never be able to get pregnant.

She said: 'I was 37, which although it is quite young compared to most people in my situation, wasn't really for me because I started trying when I was 22, so I had done a 15-year stint.

'I was told the only option was adoption or egg donation and I initially thought, "Yes! Let's try that!"

'But for various reasons, my husband and I have decided it wasn't right for us. 

'So I had this moment of realisation - that this thing I had wanted for so long was never going to happen. 

'I had a lot of grief and went through a very difficult time after that, there was a while when I couldn't see anyone with children anymore. 

'It broke me. 

'And of course, I do still sometimes look at my friends who have kids and think that could have been my life.' 

But after two difficult years, Helen and her husband have now come round to the idea of having life without children. 

She said: 'Being honest and open about it really helped me. 

'We don't hear about women that pregnancy doesn't happen for, we only hear about the miracles cases - the ones where it works, 

'Going to Gateway Women has been a massive part of my recovery. 

'I am now studying psychology at Open University - I am very interested in what makes people work.' 

And apart from that, she and her husband are just waiting to see what the future will bring them. 

She said: 'Sometimes when you're in my situation, people think you must do something really amazing with your life, but we decided we're happy as long as our life has meaning to us. 

'Because you put so much pressure on yourself when you are trying for a child that it is nice to just calm down for a bit afterwards.'

Helen is now sharing her story in an effort to help any other women who may be going through the same situation.

Wanting a family of your own is one of the most natural things in the word, but more and more women are now reaching middle age without giving birth. 

She said: 'I spent about 15 years in this baby bubble and I never once heard anyone who had been in my situation talk about it. 

'I think it's because it's just too scary, people don't always want to listen that things don't always work out, that life isn't fair. 

'It's still a taboo. 

'But what I'd like to get across is if you are in this situation, there are people who can help - it's not the end of the world. 

'I don't want to belittle what I went though because it broke my heart not being able to have a baby, but you can come out the other side of it and things do get better.' 

Helen was talking out as part of a BBC Radio 4 programme called A Life Without A Child, which can now be listened to on BBC iPlayer, which talks to three women about what it means to be childless. 

The show addresses the taboo of being a woman with no kids and the trauma and stress of years women go through to try and make that happen.
