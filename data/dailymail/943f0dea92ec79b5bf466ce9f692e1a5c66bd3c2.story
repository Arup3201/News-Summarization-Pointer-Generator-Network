Brave: Marshall Huburn, 2, suffers from arthritis

Marshall Huburn may look like a healthy and happy two-year-old - but he has a crippling disease.

The smiley toddler from Birmingham suffers from arthritis.

He has it in his jaw, spine, hips, knees, legs, elbows, feet, ankles, each finger and every toe.

Every 12 weeks, Marshall goes with his mother Hayley, 23, to have eighty of his joints drained under general anaesthetic at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

He also undergoes chemotherapy treatment to ease his pain at home every week.

Marshall was diagnosed with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis when he was 18 months old.

Mrs Huburn, who is currently pregnant with her fifth child, and her husband Frank, aged 41, knew something was wrong as they watched Marshall attempting to take his first steps.

Mr Huburn said: ‘His feet kept on turning outwards when he tried to walk. He would be very clumsy. We took him to our doctor to get him checked out.

‘But we would never have imagined that he could have arthritis.

‘I only thought it was something you got if you were elderly.

‘I was absolutely gobsmacked. The doctor told me "I know it's a lot to take in".

‘I still remember the words - it was quite a shock.

‘I was worrying that my other children could have it as well, but they said it was very unlikely two siblings will have it.’

Mrs Huburn, who is three months pregnant and has three children, Frankie, four, Sommer, also four, and Caitlyn, seven months, said she struggled to accept that her son had to have chemotherapy at first.

Side-effects of the treatment can include liver failure, kidney failure and blood cancer.

Mrs Huburn added: ‘Marshall can walk. On good days he's still very wobbly and he falls over quite a lot. Then, on bad days, he can't move.

‘He screams for hours. He'll just push himself against a wall to try to get up, or bum-shuffle around the floor. About three or four months after he was diagnosed he literally could not move, he couldn't stand and he was that way constantly, every day.

‘His brother and sister would go and play in the back garden and he wouldn't go out with them.

‘When we have good days now, it is a relief.

‘To see him stand up actually amazes me, it is like I have been given my son back.

‘The other kids are brilliant with him, they play with him. He wants to do, and he does try to do, all the things that Frankie and Sommer will do but he can't always do them. But he still gives it a go.

‘To see him smile is really nice, having seen him in so much pain. It's like he is showing me that I'm doing something right to try to control his condition.

‘It was a big decision for me to actually accept his chemo treatment every week, because of the side effects it can have.

‘I panicked, thinking "I don't want him to have more problems". Then I thought "I've got to, otherwise it's not helping him". I think it's the best thing I've done.

‘You don't know what each day holds. One day he could get up and be running around, the next day he could not move. He can't talk so it's difficult for him to let us know how he is feeling.

‘Sometimes he might scream in pain, but he's always still got a smile on his face. It makes me feel happy.

‘When he's screaming in pain it just feels horrible, I can't do anything to stop it.’

Mrs Huburn said doctors have been unable to identify why Marshall has developed the condition.

He has the second most common type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis which affects between 10,000 and 15,000 children in the UK.

Now Mrs Huburn is facing another battle, as the council house where she is living with her husband and their four children doesn't have a bath - essential for helping to ease Marshall's suffering.

Doctors recommended that Marshall soak in a bath to help ease the stiffness and swelling in his joints.

The shower, meanwhile, does not have a proper cubicle, has only released scalding hot water for the last five weeks, and has a rotten tray.

A community nurse administers Marshall's chemotherapy which should be given in a sterile environment.

Birmingham City Council said they would send out contractors to fit a new shower at Hayley's home immediately after a local newspaper contacted them and voiced Hayley's concerns over her home.

A council spokeswoman said housing managers would also inspect the property tomorrow.

She said as the house had been converted from a two-bedroom to a three-bedroom house, the bathroom is smaller than it should be and there is no room for a bath.

The spokeswoman added: ‘Contractors have been out several times to fix the shower and have reported to us they have left it in good working order.

‘Workmen sent the old shower away for testing after they installed the new one in January.’
