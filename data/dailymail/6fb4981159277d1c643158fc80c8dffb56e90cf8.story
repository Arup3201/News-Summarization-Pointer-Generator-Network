Jailed sex attacker Max Clifford has been divorced by his wife of four years in a hearing which lasted less than two minutes at a London court.

The public relations expert and wife Jo were granted a decree nisi by a judge sitting in the Central Family Court in London.

Neither was at the hearing which lasted just 105 seconds.

Clifford, 71, was given an eight-year jail term earlier this month at Southwark Crown Court after being convicted of a string of indecent assaults on four women between 1977 and 1984.

Mrs Clifford, 51, formerly Westwood, split from him on the grounds of 'unreasonable behaviour'.

Her papers stated the last incidence of unreasonable behaviour from her husband was August 18, 2012.

The form suggested their marriage had fallen apart four months before his arrest in December as part of Operation Yewtree.

In response to the question 'do you think the respondent's behaviour has effected your health?" Mrs Clifford wrote: 'Yes, I suffered from stress and heart palpitation and saw a specialist.'

Lawyer
 Raymond Tooth, who represented Mrs Clifford, said after the hearing, 
which lasted less than two minutes: 'Everything has been settled 
amicably.'

He added: 'There's no dispute anymore - but everything starts with a dispute. Marriage is the triumph of optimism over reality.'

Mrs
 Clifford, 51, who did not attend his trial and was not called as a 
character witness, was seen without her wedding ring as he awaited a 
verdict last month.

He was sentenced to eight years, the first person to be convicted under Operation Yewtree.

Irish-born Jo, who worked as his PA before they married four years ago, hired £450-an-hour celebrity lawyer Raymond Tooth.

Mr Tooth, whose reputation has earned him the nickname Jaws, had earlier confirmed: ‘They are divorcing. There are no disputed matters.

‘Everything has been sorted out amicably so it’s all done.’

Clifford’s
 fortune was estimated at £10million before the huge legal bills from 
his court case.

The 71-year-old took out a £3.5million loan on his 
London mansion in the run-up to his trial.

Mrs
 Clifford’s lawyer, whose motto is ‘Don’t get even – get Tooth’, has 
represented Irina Abramovich, 46, former wife of Chelsea Football Club 
chairman Roman, 47, Jude Law’s former wife Sadie Frost, 48, and rock 
star Eric Clapton’s ex, Pattie Boyd, 70.
