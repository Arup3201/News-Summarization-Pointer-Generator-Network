Demonstrators opposed to fracking at a site in the north of England have been mocked after begging for gas for their camp on Twitter.

Online observers quickly pointed out the irony of protestors at Barton Moss near Salford, Greater Manchester, asking for the supplies while opposing fracking for gas.

Scores of anti-fracking protesters descended on the site last November, erecting a large camp of around 60 tents and caravans along a farm track after  energy firm IGas announced it was carrying out exploratory drilling for shale gas.

Opponents of fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, are concerned about the potential environmental effects of the process, which involves the fracturing of rock by a pressurised liquid to release oil and gases.

The camp’s gas supply ran out Sunday morning and they tweeted from their account @BartonMoss: '#bartonmoss URGENTLY needs water and gas for the cooker if anyone can help'.

The tweet triggered a series of flabbergasted responses.

Twitter user NottsCo_David quipped: 'Why don't you frack for some gas?, while Foxgoose tweeted: 'Can't they burn their own dung? - that'll give them a nice foretaste of the life they want for the rest of us.'

Insider OnEnergy tweeted: 'Ironic really isn't it?!', and: 'Why can we not live what we preach and use a sustainable source?'

Mark McAndrew added: 'Oddly enough, rest of UK needs gas as well...'

IGas was granted permission for exploratory gas drilling at the site and said it is seeking methane and shale gas but has no immediate plans for fracking.

In the past four months more than 80 protesters have been arrested and charged with a variety of offences including obstruction and drink-driving.

The protest is estimated to have cost £750,000 so far with Greater Manchester Police having to prioritise more and more officers to the site.

Protesters at the Barton Moss site, which lies in the shadow of the M62, have accused the police officers of violence and bully-boy tactics.

But police accused protesters themselves of resorting to dirty tactics after a police officer was injured by a ‘booby-trap’ drum containing barbed wire and glass.

He suffered a cut to his hand last month as he attempted to free two anti-fracking protesters who locked themselves to the concrete drum.
