Andrew Henderson celebrated landing the London Broncos coaching job on a permanent basis as Halifax were beaten 22-18.

Henderson was given the nod by the London hierarchy this week after a mixed spell in caretaker charge since the departure of Joey Grima.

His weakened side put on a fine show to crown his appointment, though, scoring four tries through Daniel Harrison, Matt Garside, Iliess Macani and Brad Dwyer, whose score was the winning one.

James Saltonstall, Ben Heaton and Mitch Cahalane scored for Halifax.

Henderson had spoken earlier in the week about how he felt Broncos were moving in the right direction, and their narrow victory put some substance to his words.

The win was just their third in six in the Kingstone Press Championship having been relegated from Super League at the end of last season.
