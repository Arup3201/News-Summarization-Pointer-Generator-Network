Cousins, 36, who has a history of substance abuse, has made headlines several times in the past fortnight after a string of alleged incidents

She was fined in the Perth Magistrate's Court on Wednesday and was ordered to pay costs of $150.80.

Back in 2011 Cousins gushed about his happiness with Tinecheff after the birth of their son Bobby.

He said the birth of his child was the most important moment of his life.

'Not to take anything away from my footy, but there is just no comparison,' Cousins told New Idea.

'This is it - this is what it's all about. I still can't believe we're so blessed to have such a perfect little boy.'

He described the birth as 'life-changing' and told of his hopes to get married.

'The love you feel, it's so innocent and infinite, and completely unconditional,' he said.

Cousins, 36, who has a history of substance abuse, has recently made headlines once again over a string of alleged incidents in the past fortnight.

Cousins was allegedly seen driving erratically outside a Sikh temple he had just photographed on Monday

Cousins played 270-games with West Coast and Richmond during his career in the Australian Football League

He was arrested on March 11 after police saw him driving erratically in Bicton and was eventually caught several suburbs away in Mosman Park.

Police charged him with reckless driving, failing to stop and refusing a breath test.

Four days later, Cousins was detained for breaching security at an SAS base in Swanbourne and then taken to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital's mental health ward for assessment.

On Monday, the Brownlow medallist was again hospitalised for a mental health check after allegedly being seen driving erratically outside a Sikh temple he had just photographed and climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home.

The 36-year-old footballer allegedly upset Sikh priest, Jasvinder Singh and his wife when he reversed his car over the garden of the temple ground and parked in Mr Singh's personal car park. 

The priest tried to confront Cousins before he took off again and stopped a few metres ahead to take photos of the temple.

'Again, I tried to talk to him and he started his car,' Mr Singh said.

'I called the police and then I followed him again and he stopped his car in the middle of the road and then some cars almost hit him.'

Mr Singh then became alarmed by the behaviour and left it to the police.

'He was not looking stable.'  

Footage emerged this week showing Cousins running through the streets away from police

Cousins was spotted climbing onto the roof of a two-storey home in Perth on Monday

Footage emerged showing the fallen AFL star running through the streets away from police, before he was taken into custody for the third time in two weeks.

Cousins can be seen stopping and starting his car with its door flung wide open near the Sikh temple, before he is filmed sprinting away from the officers. 

No charges had been laid over those two incidents and inquiries are continuing, police say.

Cousins entered rehab for 'substance abuse' in 2007 and was later suspended from the AFL for one year for bringing the game into disrepute

Cousins returned to the game with Richmond in 2009, before he retired at the end of the 2010 season. 

He is scheduled to appear in Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 8.
