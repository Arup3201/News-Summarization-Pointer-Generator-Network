A grandmother died alone after a doctor marked her file with 'do not resuscitate' despite not actually seeing her, an inquest heard.

Christine Shinwell, 63, was admitted to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, after falling at her home. Her condition deteriorated rapidly and the on-call consultant was contacted by phone.

After a 15-minute conversation with a medical registrar, and without ever seeing Mrs Shinwell, he decided to put the notice on her records, Essex Coroner's Court was told.

Her grieving husband, Colin Green, 50, told the coroner that her family was not consulted and the patient was not seen by the doctor.

He told an inquest into her death that Mrs Shinwell had a long history of medical problems but added that she always tried to pull through. Mr Green also said he made it clear he wanted staff at the hospital to do anything they could to keep her alive.

He said: 'My wife is a fighter and is a very strong-willed person. Because my wife has got a huge medical file it is easy to give up on her but in every other circumstance she was okay.

'I told them "my wife is a fighter and we will take everything step-by-step. I would like you to keep us informed".'

Mrs Shinwell, who had diabetes and wore a pacemaker, died on December 4, 2009, nearly two weeks after falling at her home and fracturing her knee.

Days before she was due to be released she started having heart problems.

Dr Anser Qureshi, consultant physician at Broomfield Hospital, was on call on the night Mrs Shinwell died and made the decision to mark her file 'do not resuscitate' without consulting the family.

The decision was made at 3am, from home, after a 15-minute phone call with the medical registrar at Broomfield Hospital despite no previous knowledge of her case.

Dr Qureshi told the inquest: 'Generally we tend to discuss it with the family and patient. But at this point the patient was critically ill and did not have the capacity to respond.

'She was dying and CPR was going to be futile. Due to her complex medical history the side effects of the CPR would be worse than the benefits.

'I must say that it was an extremely complex case and a very hard decision. I thought it was in the best interest of the patient. We did not deny her other treatment such as antibiotics.

'The patient was so unwell, I firmly believed it would do her harm rather than any benefit.'

Independent expert, Dr Clive Lewis, said she was given a 50 per cent chance of surviving for 'one or two years' after being diagnosed with cardiomyopathy in 1998.

He said: 'It was clear Mrs Shinwell was a remarkable survivor as we had been told that her outlook had been bad in 1998.

'To have survived over 10 years is remarkable but we have to note the prognosis at this point was very poor. She was always living on a knife edge.'

Pathologist Dr Martin Goddard, who conducted the post-mortem, told the inquest: 'This is a woman who was at the end of her cardiac function. This is a heart that really had nothing left to give.'

The two-day inquest heard evidence from a number of heart experts.

Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray criticised Broomfield Hospital for failing to communicate with the family and failing to provide better care in the hours leading up to Mrs Shinwell's death.

She said: 'Clearly communication has been an issue in this case. Two doctors have commented on the matter and I hope that new measures introduced since 2009 will prevent this happening in future.

She recorded a narrative verdict.

She said: 'The deceased had a long, complex medical history including end-stage cardiac failure. On December 1, 2009 she suffered cardiac problems and despite on-going treatment she died on December 4 of natural causes.'

A spokesman for Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust, which runs Broomfield Hospital, said: 'The trust had previously undertaken a thorough investigation into the circumstances of Mrs Shinwell's death, and was confident in the care it had provided.

'Mid Essex Hospital Services NHS Trust always strives to ensure lessons are learnt from any deaths that occur at the hospital and is pleased that a thorough investigation and Inquest has taken place.

'Mrs Shinwell received excellent state-of-the-art care from the NHS, in particular over the last 25 years of her life - including life-prolonging and life-saving treatment.

'The trust is pleased that the independent expert instructed to report by the coroner was also satisfied that the care and treatment provided to Mrs Shinwell was appropriate and to a good standard.

'The independent expert was also at pains to stress that Mrs Shinwell's courageous battle had come to its natural and inevitable end and that there was no treatment that could have been provided by anyone at the trust or indeed by any other healthcare centre that would have altered the outcome.

'The trust wishes Mrs Shinwell's family its deepest sympathy and condolences at this sad time.'

Distraught daughter Heidi Coles, 42, from Chelmsford, fought back tears outside the coroners' court as she slammed doctors for not doing enough to keep her mother alive.

The mother-of-two said: 'If you're dying then your family should be there with you. We wanted to be by her side but instead she died alone.

'We know my mum had heart trouble, we know she'd had kidney trouble but she was stable. She was strong and she was a fighter - we miss her every day.'

Mr Green added: 'We have been fighting this so no other family has to go through losing someone they love in this way.'
