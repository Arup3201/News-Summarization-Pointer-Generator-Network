A disabled man was asked to pay £30 to retrieve his lost wallet from a bus company.

Arthur Adlam, 31, had just drawn his disability allowance and had around £225 in his wallet when he accidentally left it behind on the bus.

But his panic quickly turned to disbelief when he was told that though his property had been handed in, it would cost him almost £30 to get it back.

Arthur Adlam, 31, from Dunfermline, who suffered an epileptic fit after Stagecoach charged him almost £30 to get his own wallet back

Father-of-four Arthur, 31, left the wallet on the seat of a Stagecoach bus in his home town of Dunfermline, Fife.

But staff at the bus station told him it was company policy to take a 12 per cent cut plus a 50p 'admin fee' - a total of £27.50 - just to get it back.

Furious Mr Adlam said: 'It’s an outrage. They told me they couldn’t give it back without charging me.

'They charged me for something that doesn’t belong to them. No one should pay to get their own money back.'

Eventually he negotiated the fee down to
£10 - but now red-faced coach chiefs have offered to give the full 
amount back and review their penny-pinching policy.

Stagecoach, which posted pre-tax profits of £195.8million this year, initially ran buses 
between London and Dundee but expanded rapidly throughout the nineties.

It eventually diversified into trains and trams and moved into markets overseas, particularly in the United States and Canada.

It
now operates South West Trains and its rail portfolio includes South 
Western and East Midlands Trains - and also has a 49 per cent stake in Sir Richard 
Branson’s Virgin Rail Group which operates the West Coast Main line.

Mr Adlam said: 'I was on the bus taking the kids down to the nursery, but when I got off I didn’t notice the wallet was missing.

'I had withdrawn my disability allowance earlier that morning and wasn’t sure what I was going to do without the money.'

Apologetic: Stagecoach have since offered to give Mr Adlam his money back and say they will review the policies on lost property

'While I was at the nursery, I retraced my steps and the staff called up Stagecoach and the police, because I was panicking at that point.'

Staff at Beanstalk nursery made phone calls on his behalf to trace the lost wallet and a few hours later the wallet turned up at the bus depot in Dunfermline.

The bus company called up with the good news and the bad. His wallet had been handed in - but there was a charge.

Mr Adlam added: 'A few hours later Stagecoach called up the nursery said they wanted a cut of 12 per cent and a 50p admin fee.

'They wanted to take £27.50 off me, but Beanstalk got them to reduce it to a tenner.

'Then they rang me at home and it just stressed me out. It was too much and I had a fit and fell to the floor.

'Luckily my partner was there until it was over. I’ve had epilepsy for 15 years and whenever I get hit on the head or too stressed I can suffer from fit.'

Bus operators Stagecoach today agreed to refund Mr Adlam and review their policy, which appears only to be in operation in West Fife.

A Stagecoach spokesman said: 'A local policy is in place in West Fife to charge a "finder fee" for the monies claimed from our lost property, with the fee going to the driver, or member of the public who has handed in any such items to us.

'We were not aware our local company had put this policy in place and we have instructed them to stop the practice.

'There was never any intention by the company to profit from lost property.

'We are sorry for the upset it has caused to the customer.'

Knighted: Sir Brian was recognised for his humanitarian work

Stagecoach was founded by Scots brother and sister Brian Souter and Ann Gloag. They launched the company with their father's redundancy money in 1980.

Initially the company ran buses between London and Dundee but expanded rapidly throughout the nineties and in 1993 was valued at £134million.

It eventually diversified into trains and trams and moved into markets overseas, particularly in the United States and Canada.

It now operates South West Trains and its rail portfolio includes South Western and East Midlands Trains it also has a 49% stake in Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Rail Group which operates the West Coast Main line.

The company posted pre-tax profits of £195.8million this year,

In 2009 Souter received a £1.6million bonus but donated £900,000 of it to his own Christian-based charity which assists with humanitarian projects in the UK and around the world.

Sir Brian is a major financial supporter of the Scottish National Party and has donated millions of pounds to the party over the years.

Opponents have accused him being homophobic especially after he donated £1million to a campaign which discouraged local government in Scotland from 'promoting homosexuality.'

In 2011 he was awarded a knighthood for services to the transport and voluntary sector.

On 18 April 2012, Souter was inducted 
into the British Travel and Hospitality Industry Hall of Fame. He is the
first public transport entrepreneur to receive the honour.

Last year it was announced that he would step down as Chief Executive of Stagecoach and in May this year he took up the position of Chairman and was replaced by former finance director Martin Griffiths.
