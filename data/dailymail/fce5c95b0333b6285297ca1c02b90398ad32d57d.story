A British expat has spent $25,000 turning a car into a giant banana which can be driven.

Steve Braithwaite, who is originally from Woodstock, Oxon, but now lives in Kalamazoo, Michigan, is the owner of the unique motor.

It took the 54-year-old two years and $25,000 to realise his vision.

Let's split! Steve Braithwaite now lives in Michigan and enjoys driving around in his motor with his friends

Despite setting a budget of just $10,000, he thinks it has been worth every penny. 

Unsurprisingly,
 the car is a real head-turner for everyone it drives past and has 
become a big hit at motor shows and children's birthdays.

Mr Braithwaite said: 'The best thing about the banana car is when kids see it.

'You just see them yank on their mothers arms and shout "banana, banana!" and it's brilliant.

'I get people doing double takes like you see in the movies all the time.

'It can be a curse having this car if you're in a rush.

'I'll be in a real hurry to get somewhere and need to pull in at a gas station very quickly, but 45 minutes later I'll still be there as everyone asks for photos.'

Mr Braithwaite had the idea to make a ridiculous car for a while but only started building it in 2009 after a chance meeting with a fruit basket.

He said: 'One day my former wife came home from grocery shopping one day and suggested I build a bananacar but I just laughed it off.

Steve Braithwaite was inspired by a banana in a fruit bowl on the counter of a gas station when he realised the shape was perfect for a car

'Then I was in a gas station a few months later, and there was a bowl full of fruit on the counter, and I realised the shape was perfect for a car and the rest is history.'

Under the almost two tonne banana's bonnet is a 302ci Ford V8 - which Mr Braithwaite believes makes it the only fruit to have a V8 engine - allowing it to reach a top speed of 85mph.

Website builder Mr Braithwaite said: 'I have challenged the Oscar Mayer Weiner Mobile to a drag race but I haven't heard back and it's been more than a year - I think they're just scared.'

After being spotted around town, people started to request its attendance at birthday parties, which Mr Braithwaite's friend Tom Brown was all too happy to arrange.

Now its popularity has grown and the car has made corporate appearances for companies as big as Del Monte.

However, that wasn't the vehicle's original purpose.

He said: 'Originally the plan was to travel from the States, across the Atlantic to Blighty, then cross Europe and Asia, finally leaving China to cross the Pacific and come home.

'I've had the travel bug for 15 years now, ever since me and my sisters went to India and rode motorbikes down dusty country roads.'

Mr Braithwaite moved to America in 1987 when he was 26 after watching the film American Graffiti.

The intrepid explorer said: 'I have been living over here since 1987 but I must have had something like the same amount of addresses as the years I've lived here.'
