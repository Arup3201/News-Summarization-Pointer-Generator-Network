A seven-year-old boy crashed headfirst into a wall after the throttle on his £300 quad bike jammed.

Cody Watts had just jumped onto the electric cart when the throttle 'jammed', sending the machine hurtling towards his house.Cheltenham, Gloucestershire,

The entire incident was captured on CCTV - showing the moment the youngster slammed into the sidewall at the top speed of 13mph.

His face took the full impact as he was catapulted into the brickwork but luckily he was wearing a Star Wars helmet which protected his head.

Cody was taken to hospital where he was given the all-clear except for his grazed knuckles and a bruised knee.

Lucky escape: Cody Watts was wearing a full-face helmet when he hit the wall so escaped any head injuries

His father Geoff, 34, who runs a business coaching company, said: 'He was very shocked - he's a really nice kid and his first reaction was to say sorry for breaking the wall and the bike.'

Cody was given the £315 Electric Mini Quad Fun Bike by his grandfather as a sixth birthday present.

The 800 watt 36 volt electric motor boasts three speeds - 5mph, 8mph and 13mph - and is recommended for children aged six to 12 years.

Cody has used the machine to race around his parents' quarter-acre back garden in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, without incident for the last 18 months.

But when he hopped on it last Saturday it suddenly shot backwards out of the shed as soon as he switched it on.

The quad smashed into the playhouse - knocking off the roof - and a panicked Cody then put the machine into 'forwards'.

But the bike then shot forward at full speed and slammed into the house.

Protected: Cody's helmet protected his head so he only suffered grazed knuckles and a bruised knee

His mother Alison said: 'He was helping his dad paint the shed but when he got bored with that he got the quad bike out.

'As he got it out he put it in reverse and it shot backwards and hit our wendy house.

'I assume he thought he'd done something wrong so he put it into drive and it just shot forwards.

'The throttle stuck, he couldn't move it back into neutral and it propelled him forward and only stopped when it hit the wall.'

The whole incident was captured on the CCTV system installed at their home.

Alison, who carries out administrative work for her husband's company, added: 'When I saw the video I was really shocked.

'I wasn't here when it happened and children can be quite dramatic but when I saw it I thought thank god my husband took him to A&E. We feel very lucky.'

Birthday present: Cody, pictured with his mother Alison, got the bike for his sixth birthday. It worked perfectly for 18 months until the throttle jammed on Saturday

Warning: Cody's family are now urging all parents to make sure their children wear full-face helmets when using quad bikes

Mother-of-two Alison, 35, is now urging other parents to make sure their children wear full-face helmets.

She said: 'He used to wear just his bike helmet but as he got more confident we insisted he wear a full-face one.

'Luckily he quite liked it and was happy to wear it because he thought it made him look like someone out of Star Wars.

'The side of his head took most of the impact and if he hadn't been wearing the big helmet we're pretty sure he'd have broken his jaw or cheekbone.'

Alison and Geoff say the bike is still jammed in 'full speed' mode as soon as it is switched on and Cody's grandfather is due to alert Fun Bikes to the issue.

Fun Bikes have declined to comment on the matter.
