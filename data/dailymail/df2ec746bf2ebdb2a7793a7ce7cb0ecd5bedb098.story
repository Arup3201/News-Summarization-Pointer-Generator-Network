Snails may be considered a French delicacy, but it was in fact Spanish cavemen who discovered the cuisine 10,000 years before their northern neighbours.

Hundreds of burnt snail shells were found alongside tools near what were believed to be ancient fireplaces in caves along a cliff in Spain.

The find suggests roasted snails were a particular favourite of Palaeolithic humans living in the area between 31,000 and 26,900 years ago.

Archaeologists recently found an ancient fireplace (left) and (right) snail burnt shells in a rock shelter in Spain. The find, dating to 30,000 years ago, suggests humans ate snails during the Paleolithic period

The discovery, made at the Cova de la Barriada site on Spain’s Costa Blanca, means our ancestors may have been more discerning eaters than previously believed.

Snails were widespread in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene, but it is still unknown when and how they were incorporated into human diets.

The delicacy is rich in protein, fat (mainly 'healthy' polyunsaturated fatty acid), iron, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, zinc, vitamins A, B6, B12, K and folate.

The researchers behind the new study, published in the journal Plos One, found snail shell remains from 30,000 years ago at the Spanish site near Benidorm.

Javier Fernandez-Lopez de Pablo, of Institut Catala de Paleoecologia Humana i Evolucio Social, and colleagues investigated patterns of land snail selection.

Scientists found groupings of complete shells from a large land snail species at three areas of the site. The discovery, made at the Cova de la Barriada site on Spain's Costa Blanca, means our ancestors may have been more discerning eaters than previously believed

You might think of Neanderthals as lumbering cavemen who feasted on slaughtered beasts, but new research suggests they preferred far more refined cuisine.

Scientists in this latest study believe Neanderthals may have eaten sea slugs, but there isn't much evidence that modern humans ate land-based snails until 20,000 years ago.

A separate study of ancient fossilised poo left behind by Neanderthals reveals they also had a diet which featured vegetables and nuts.

The 50,000-year-old samples from Spain are the oldest known Neanderthal faecal matter and  suggest cavemen knew the importance of a varied diet.

They also looked at where the snail shells were scattered at the site, the shells’ decay, fossilisation process, composition, and age at death by measuring the shell size.

They found groupings of complete shells from a large land snail species at three areas of the site, corresponding to different time points 30,000 years ago.

Dr Fernandez-Lopez de Pablo said: ‘The adult snails were close to prehistoric human-constructed structures that may have been used to cook the snails, along with stone tools, and other animal remains that were likely roasted in ambers of pine and juniper at 375C.’

The researchers believe that these results point to previously undiscovered patterns of invertebrate use and may highlight a broadening of the human diet in the Upper Paleolithic in the Mediterranean basin.

Dr Fernandez-Lopez de Pablo added: ‘In neighbouring Mediterranean areas, eating land snails didn’t appear until about 10,000 years later, which may make these newly found snail shells the oldest known evidence that ancient human populations used them as a food resource in Europe around 30,000 years ago.’

Snails may be considered a French delicacy today, but it was in fact Spanish cavemen who discovered the cuisine 10,000 years before their northern neighbours
