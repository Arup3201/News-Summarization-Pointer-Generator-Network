Trendsetter: Booboo the American-created blonde guinea pig has almost 17,000 followers on Instagram 

She poses with flower garlands in her blonde hair and has been hailed the ‘world’s cutest guinea pig’

And now she has been hailed the ‘world’s cutest guinea pig’ after her pictures attracted thousands of fans.

Ms Van der Elst said: ‘I love to take pictures of her. She's the perfect model, cooperative, versatile and very relaxed. Booboo is a two-year-old blonde guinea pig from the Netherlands. 

'There's no special meaning behind the name, my sister came up with the name and I thought it was cute.

‘She's not that social to other guinea pigs though, I would say a spirited lady. She also doesn't walk, stays if you put her somewhere till you pick her up again.

She lives with fellow guinea pigs, Titi and Tedd, in the Netherlands and loves snuggling up in a scarf

Her favourite hobbies include eating carrots, lying in her cage and posing in front of the camera

‘She is quite spoiled and often not interested in things. I think all these things give her a strong and unique character. 

'Unfortunately she can't get babies anymore, she's too old for that now. I really would like to see guinea pigs being born, it would be so cute.’

Booboo has been photographed wearing a variety of looks, including a knitted scarf, pink bunny ears and beautiful flowers garlands.
