TALE FOR TWO

Members of the media advised to have rabies jabs before heading out to Brazil scoffed at the notion that it wasn’t just dogs but also monkeys they had to look out for. Scoff no more, though, after a family of three monkeys clambered across telephone wires and down a tree to gain access to the breakfast room at a Salvador hotel on Monday morning.

50 MW

Ghana has had recent power shortages, but their neighbours Ivory Coast supplied 50 megawatts of electricity to help ensure their big match against the USA wasn’t interrupted.

LATE AND WE WON'T WAIT

You may have noticed a smattering of empty seats at some stadiums at kick-off, which is not unusual for a World Cup. But the situation is not being helped by the authorities refusing to allow planes to land at airports for an hour either side of match kick-offs. So if your plane is late, it’s really late.

On that same note, the touts are not having a great time out here, simply because many locals can’t afford to attend games. One group of English tourists were trying to sell Germany v Portugal match tickets at face value before yesterday’s game but couldn’t get rid of them.

PICTURE OF THE DAY

Mario Balotelli has kept himself busy in Brazil collecting football stickers. The eccentric Italian posted this photo on his Facebook page after filling the Italy section entirely with pictures of himself.

SPAT OF THE DAY

Robbie Savage was in good company on the BBC sofa with Thierry Henry and Clarence Seedorf but was put in his place by the Frenchman.

When Savage compared a gritty Honduras to his Leicester team taking on Arsenal, Henry replied with a condescending: ‘We managed...’ Ooh la la.

GOOD MEMORIES

Brazilian TV is a bit 1970s at times, but the current VW ad is a cracker. Rio’s street kids re-enact some of Brazil’s greatest football moments, including Carlos Alberto’s goal in the 1970 final.

Croatia players are refusing to talk to the press after they were photographed bathing nude by two snappers lurking in the bushes.

BEST BET BRIAN

One team packed full of Premier League stars blew it on Saturday night against Italy but another one can get off to a flyer on Tuesday.

Belgium can be bright in Brazil so back Eden Hazard at 6/1 for the first goal when they take on Algeria.

CUT-PRICE CHRIS

Algeria are tough nuts to crack at a World Cup. Either that or England were completely useless in 2010.

Belgium will again prove the latter and Romelu Lukaku to score first in a 3-0 win is tempting at 22-1.
