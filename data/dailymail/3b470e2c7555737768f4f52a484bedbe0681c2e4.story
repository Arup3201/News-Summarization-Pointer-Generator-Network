Most people would be delighted to be stuck at the same age for a while, but for Maguerite Joseph, it has been disappointing.

The 104-year-old Michigan woman, who has been active on Facebook for the last few years, says she is unable to post her actual age on the site because it exceeds 99.

Since Mrs Joseph is legally blind and hard of hearing, her granddaughter Gail Marlow updates her profile page for her each day and responds to her messages.

Ms Marlow says that when she tries inputting her grandmother's birth year as 1908, Facebook changes it to 1928 with a message that says 'unknown error.'

So for the past two years, the Grosse Pointe Shores centenarian has remained 99 - online, anyway.

Among Mrs Joseph's Facebook 'likes' are the Detroit Red Wings, I Love Lucy and gambling.

When she's not on Facebook, she attends church once a week and loves taking trips to the casino.

Then and now: Mrs Joseph is pictured at 16 years old, left, at at 103, right. She will turn 105 in April

A little help: Since Mrs Joseph is legally blind and hard of hearing, her granddaughter Gail Marlow updates the Facebook page for her and responds to her messages

She currently has 149 friends on the site.

She says that she mainly uses the site to stay in touch with relatives across the country, and in Canada.

Ms Marlow reads and responds to all of her Facebook messages, and told WDIV-TV that she even sent a few to Facebook honcho Mark Zuckerberg seeking a fix to the problem.

She said that she has not yet received a response.

Awaiting response: Mrs Joseph's granddaughter says she has even reached out to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, pictured on Wednesday in San Francisco, but she is yet to hear back

A Facebook spokesman told MailOnline:
'We've recently discovered an issue whereby some Facebook users may be 
unable to enter a birthday before 1910.

'We are working on a fix for this and we apologize for the inconvenience.'

Ms Marlow told the station she 'would love to see' Joseph's real age displayed on Facebook and chalks up her inability to do so to 'a glitch in the system.'

She said: 'I would love to see her real age on Facebook. I mean, in April she’s going to be 105. It’s special.'
