A woman who was admitted to Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth suffering 'ebola-like' symptoms has been cleared of the deadly disease.

In a statement, a hospital spokeswoman said: 'The patient has been released from quarantine and is no longer a suspected case of Ebola'. 

The woman was kept in a purpose-built isolation room, the spokeswoman said, which had in-built air conditioning controls to isolate the air flow from the remainder of the hospital.

Nine News reported the woman had recently returned from west Africa. 

The incident comes after a man was tested for the deadly disease at the same hospital just last week. 

He was found to be suffering from a less serious illness and returned home after treatment. 

The hospital spokeswoman said: 'It is important to note that WA is collaborating closely with other states and territories, and the Commonwealth, via the Communicable Diseases Network Australia, to ensure a coordinated risk assessment and response to Ebola virus disease in Australia.'

'The risk of people with the Ebola virus travelling to Australia is considered very low,' the spokeswoman said.

'Even if travellers from West Africa did develop Ebola (virus) after arrival in WA, or elsewhere in Australia, our standard of care and infection control is such that once the disease was diagnosed there would be a very low risk of transmission to other persons'. 

According for the Centre for Disease Control, Ebola can only be spread through direct contact, such as the exchange of bodily fluids.
