Whistleblower: Metropolitan Police constable James Patrick, who described how 'massaging' crime figures was common practice

Police are failing to properly record crimes as serious as rape to hit performance targets, a damning report has revealed.

A target culture within policing has created ‘perverse incentives’ and driven officers up to the most senior level to ‘misrecord’ crime, MPs said.

The Public Administration select committee called for local Police and Crime Commissioners to abolish all targets to  help restore public trust in  crime figures.

They also called for an investigation into treatment of a police officer who blew the whistle on corrupt recording practices.

Former Metropolitan Police officer James Patrick described how massaging numbers to hit targets had become ‘an ingrained part of policing culture’.

He exposed how crimes were routinely downgraded, with robberies logged as theft and burglary reclassified as criminal damage – or even ‘no-crimed’ – to make them ‘disappear in a puff of smoke’.

He resigned last month after an investigation into misconduct was launched.

The report was published as a new YouGov poll for Channel 5 found 40 per cent of Britons think crime has gone up in the last decade. This is despite police figures and the national crime survey showing sharp falls in crime levels.

Bernard Jenkin, the committee chairman, said it was ‘depressing’ how the officer was treated by the Met and claimed most forces were ‘still in denial about the damage targets cause, both to data integrity and to standards of behaviour’.

The report found crime figures recorded by the police vastly exaggerated the extent of genuine decreases in recent years.

National targets for crime figures have been abolished by the Home Office. But the report found targets, and a target culture, remained at a local level, set by Police and Crime Commissioners or senior officers.

Most national targets for crime statistics have been completely abolished by the Home Office, but they still remain at a local level, set by Police and Crime Commissioners

These, it said, ‘drive perverse incentives to misrecord crime, tend to affect attitudes and erode data quality’.

It went on to warn: ‘The attitudes and behaviour which lead to the misrecording of crime have become ingrained.’

In particular, the report pointed to ‘strong evidence’ that sex crimes such as rape were under-recorded in many areas, with MPs concluding that officers were failing to comply with national crime recording rules.

The report also found ministers and statisticians have been ‘too passive’ in failing to confront concerns over the quality of police statistics.

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘It’s encouraging that this issue is being investigated by Parliament but the findings are damning.

‘There should really be only one way the police make crime figures look better: by catching more criminals and bringing them to justice. Anything else is fiddling the figures.’

Shadow police minister Jack Dromey said the credibility of the Government’s crime statistics now ‘lies in tatters’.

Earlier this year, police crime figures were stripped of their national kitemark by the statistics watchdog – official recognition of the fact they could no longer be trusted.

However Chief Constable Alex Marshall, chief executive of the College of Policing, pointed to the new Code of Ethics for officers.

He said: ‘In terms of crime recording, the Code specifically highlights the importance  of accurate and honest record-keeping.’
