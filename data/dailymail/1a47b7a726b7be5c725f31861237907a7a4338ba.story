Bizarre note: Jonathan 'War Machine' Koppenhaver, awaiting trial on the attempted murder of his ex girlfriend, wrote that he 'forgives' his alleged victim

The MMA-fighter accused of brutally assaulting his porn star ex-girlfriend penned a bizarre suicide note before attempting to take his own life in a Las Vegas jail cell, where he paints himself as the victim. 

Jonathan 'War Machine' Koppenhaver, 32, denies 32 felony charges, including attempted murder and rape, following the assault of porn superstar Christy Mack and her male friend.

In the letter, Koppenhaver writes that he 'forgives' 23-year-old Mack, who was beaten within an inch of her life in the attack in August, and accuses the district attorney of 'scaring her into telling painful lies' about him. 

 Koppenhaver, who legally changed his name to War Machine in 2008, was found unresponsive about 9:30pm Tuesday by a corrections officer walking by his cell at Clark County jail. 

Rushing to help, the prison guard was able to call for help and medical aid was administered to the martial artist.

In the note, sent to a friend the day before his attempted suicide and obtained by TMZ, Koppenhaver addresses Mack directly, writing: 'I forgive you, please forgive me, I love you.

'In hard times, know that I am there to lean on.

Later he adds: 'I still don’t understand how I got into this mess, I don’t know why this had to happen.

'It is one thing to catch a case when you set out to commit a crime, but catching a case when you have nothing but good intentions in your heart is just so hard to accept.’

He then goes on calling some of the 32 charges, including rape, attempted murder and kidnapping, 'B.S. fantasy charges'.

He writes that everyone who knows him, 'especially Christy' knows he is a good person with a 'huge heart' and strangely adding that 'I'm not gonna watch the woman I love go on the stand and tell painful lies about me.'

He goes on to accuse Mack's agent of forcing her to press charges against him for publicity and money, as well as the district attorney of pressuring and ‘scaring’ Mack into testifying against him. 

The 32-year-old MMA fighter was arrested in a hotel room in a Los Angeles suburb on August 15, one week after allegedly beating his former girlfriend, Christy Mack, so severely she feared for her life.

Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' on August 8 showed up unannounced at her house where she and friend, Corey Thomas, were sleeping.

She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault. 

Attacked: Porn star Christy Mack, 23, says that attack left her with 18 broken bones around her eyes, a nose broken in two places, and hair sawed off by a knife

Victim: Mack, seen here in a self portrait she posted on Instagram, told police she had no idea how many times she was hit

Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Koppenhaver after Mack posted the graphic photos of her injuries online on August 11

Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her, as he scrolled through her text messages.

According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver.

Mack said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife.

She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife.

She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego.

'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me.

'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating.

'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.'

Moving on: The 23-year-old porn star posted this image on her Instagram last week, where she is detailing her road to recovery after the brutal assault, writing that she is set to get new teeth put in

Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth.

She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side.

'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote.

'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife.

'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die.

'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts. '

Mack said her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her.

'He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard.

'After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.'

Koppenhaver, who pleaded not guilty tot he 32 charges, is being held without bail and is currently on suicide watch while he awaits trial in Las Vegas

Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife.

'I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house.

'Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.'

Attempt: Jonathan Koppenhaver sent a suicide note the day before he attempted to kill himself

Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she dealt with beatings and infidelity in the past.

After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for Koppenhaver and he became the subject of a manhunt. 

Koppenhaver pleaded not guilty in September to 32 felony charges including attempted murder during his first appearance in a Las Vegas courtroom.

Prosecutors, who originally charged Jonathan Koppenhaver with nine felony counts in connection with the beating of his ex-girlfriend, added about two dozen more charges that stretch back to May 2013.

The new charges include allegations of burglary, first-degree kidnapping, coercion and sexual assault. 

Justice of the Peace Melanie Tobiasson ordered Koppenhaver held without bail and he remains in medical isolation while on suicide watch, according to TMZ. 

The welterweight fighter made his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in 2007.

He legally changed his name in 2008. He lost his only pay-per-view bout that same year.

He fought out of San Diego for a variety of promotions and had a 14-5 record as a welterweight. He lost his last fight, in Iowa, last October.
