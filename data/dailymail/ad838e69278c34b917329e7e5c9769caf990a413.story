Sam Twiston-Davies is only 21 but he is hobbling around the office building at Grange Hill Farm like a wizened old man. A crashing fall at Wincanton the previous evening has left him barely able to walk. Most people would be in bed but Twiston-Davies, like all jump jockeys, is a breed apart.

His most pressing concern is not the crippling bruising on his left hip but passing a medical examination so he can ride at Market Rasen that afternoon.

‘I spent the night with it iced up,’ he said. ‘But then the ice fell off my leg and my bed was soaking wet when I woke up. I’ll ice it in the lorry on the way down to take away the swelling. They make you do squats and press-ups to show you’re OK. They’re very good at strapping you up and getting you back out there.’

Falls are as much a part of the job as hot baths to make weight and studying the formbook every morning. Twiston-Davies knows they are coming — ‘I think one in every eight or nine rides ends on the deck’ — but it would never stop him from racing. 

Sam Twiston-Davies is relishing his new role as stable jockey for Paul Nicholls

The risk 
of bone-crunching falls is even perversely useful in engendering a sense
 of brotherhood in the weighing room. ‘You’re like a massive 
dysfunctional family in there,’ said  Twiston-Davies. 

‘You
 might not get along with the lad three pegs down but if  he was to have
 a fall you’d be  the first to help him out, get his car home and see 
him in the  hospital.’

Twiston-Davies
 is the hottest property in race riding. Last month he was made stable 
jockey for Paul Nicholls — champion trainer in eight of the last nine 
years — and had his first winner in his new job on Pressies Girl on 
Thursday evening. Nicholls has previously shared his best horses among a
 number of jockeys but Twiston-Davies will have the pick of the bunch 
this season.

It
 is a move which means he could be the biggest threat to the dominance 
of AP McCoy in the last two decades. Not that he has any ideas about 
toppling the greatest champion racing has ever had. 

‘To
 think about ever challenging him is crazy,’ he said in reverential 
tones. ‘You wouldn’t ever think about trying to beat AP. Richard 
Johnson’s tried for 19 years and finished second and third every time. I
 think AP’s the most dominant champion in world sport, just to ride in 
the same generation as him is a privilege. The long-term dream for me is
 to be champion jockey but it’s never going to happen when AP’s around.

Laid-back: Twiston-Davies was relaxing at his father's yard in the Cotswolds

‘The
 day AP retires is going to be a sad day for racing because we’ll all 
miss him, but it’s going to be so competitive because the whole thing’s 
going to open up. The domination he has is amazing.’

Twiston-Davies
 was three years old when McCoy won the first of his 19 champion jockey 
titles in 1996. With his lightly freckled face, red hair and airy charm,
 he oozes youth but has had a whole lifetime preparing for this career.

The oldest son of trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies grew up in Cheltenham, 
the home of jump racing,  surrounded by jockeys. 

‘Carl
 Llwellyn was stable jockey for my dad when I was growing up. He won two
 Grand Nationals on Saturdays and then was sat down with us on Monday 
morning at the kitchen table eating boiled eggs and soldiers for 
breakfast before we went to school.

Family affair: Sam will keep the ride on his father's star horse The New One, who is a leading contender for next year's Champion Hurdle

‘I
 learned so much from having all these amazing jockeys around so there’s
 no way I would be riding as well as I am without having my start here. 
But at the same time, the early days were all about trying to prove 
myself, to show that I wasn’t just getting rides because of my dad.

‘I did all the mucking out and riding out the same as everyone  but I think sometimes people didn’t understand that at first.’

Twiston-Davies
 is rake thin, with his tracksuit bottoms hanging from his hips and 
wearing a Las Vegas hoodie bought during a trip to Nevada last week with
 fellow jockeys Aidan Coleman and Richie McLernon. 

‘I
 went away to Vegas weighing 9st11 and came back 9st12 despite eating 
three massive meals a day. I’m quite lucky in that respect.’

Younger brother Willy, 19, rides on the flat and is stable jockey for Mick Channon.

Rising star: Twiston-Davies' spiralling profile has seen him get the job as Paul Nicholls' stable jockey

‘You
 wouldn’t believe we were brothers,’ said Twiston-Davies, ‘He’s 6ft tall
 and made of nothing.

Because he has to watch his weight so much he’d be
 lucky to have a meal a day so he’s grumpy a lot of the time. He’s very 
quiet because he saves so much of the energy for trying to be bubbly in 
the paddock beforehand. He’s great fun when he’s eating and drinking 
normally.

‘It’s hard watching
 what he does but those are the sacrifices he’s willing to make. We all 
make sacrifices because it’s the best job in the country.’

A
 natural raconteur, Twiston-Davies is more ebullient than most jockeys 
and sees his responsibilities as extending beyond the winning post.

‘I
 try to be happy,’ he said. ‘When the owners are there I try to make 
their five minutes before and after their horse has run enjoyable. Even 
if I’ve pulled it up five out, if I can somehow put a smile on their 
face afterwards then I’ve done my job.’
