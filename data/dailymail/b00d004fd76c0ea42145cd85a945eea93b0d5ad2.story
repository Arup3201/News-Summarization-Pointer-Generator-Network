A thousand frenzied twitchers have rushed to the south coast after a rare bird of prey was spotted on mainland Britain for the first time ever.

Police were needed to control crowds as bird watchers flocked to Wareham Forest in Dorset after news broke that a short-toed eagle had been seen over the weekend.

The young bird of prey, which has a 6ft wingspan, got lost on its first migration from Africa and ended up on the south coast of Britain rather than southern Europe.

Enthusiasts have travelled from as far afield as Scotland to glimpse the endangered bird, which has only ever been seen twice before in the UK before - in Jersey in 1999 and the Scilly Isles in 2011.

The eagle has lost its way by hundreds of miles on its journey from sub-Saharan Africa to southern Europe, with the majority of the species heading to southern France, Spain, Turkey, Greece and Russia.

Rare bird in flight: This short-toed eagle has got lost on its way from Africa to southern Europe and ended up in Dorset by mistake, leading to great excitement among enthusiastsÂ 

Bird lovers: Hundreds of people descended on the area with telescopes and cameras hoping to catch a glimpse of the rare bird of prey

Paul Morton caught sight of the bird of prey while leading a guided walk through the 8,000-acre woodland.

He put the news of the rare sighting on Twitter on Saturday afternoon and within a few hours hundreds of bird watchers turned up. By Sunday morning their numbers had more than doubled .

Mr Morton, 31, from Upton near Poole, said: 'I was leading a guided walk in Wareham Forest when a member of our party spotted a bird of prey in a tree.

'At first I thought the bird was a pale-faced buzzard, which is very common in Dorset, but as I got closer I could see I was wrong.

'Suddenly it hit me that I was looking at a short-toed eagle. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing because spotting one is almost unheard of.

'I have studied birds all my life and but I wanted to make sure I had identified it correctly so I got in touch with some bird watcher friends and they all confirmed I was right.

'The eagle flew off 15 minutes after we spotted it but it returned to almost the exact same tree at four or five hours later.

'I returned on Sunday morning and there must have 500 bird watchers there.

'In bird-watching terms the sighting is huge - never before has a short-toed eagle been seen on mainland Britain.'

Rare sighting: The birds are common in central and southern Europe during the British summer, especially in the south of France, but this young bird overshot the area by hundreds of miles

Short-toed eagles migrate from Africa in the spring and can live up to 30 year. The birds are common in central and southern Europe and have a wingspan of up to 6ft

Excitement: The crowd on top of Morden Bog on Saturday, whose numbers grew even more on Sunday as word spread online that the bird had unexpectedly arrived in Britain after flying off course

Short toed eagles - Circaetus gallicus in Latin - over-winter in sub-Saharan Africa and are most commonly found in central Europe, especially southern France, in the summer.

They feed on lizards and snakes and hunt from a height of around 1,500 feet.

Mr Morton, who runs the charity Birds of Poole Harbour, added: 'This eagle is only a one year old so this is its first migration.

'The thinking is that it has got a bit lost on the way up from Africa where it would have spent the winter.

'Instead of ending up in central Europe it has been blown across to Britain in the easterly winds we have had a lot of lately.

'There are plenty of lizards and snakes and in Wareham Forest so we might just find it sticks around for the summer if we are lucky.'

Crowd control: Police were called in to deal with the huge numbers of bird watchers who descended on the small corner of Dorset over the weekend

Twitchers at dawn: After an expert spotted the rare short-toed eagle in Dorset and revealed it on Twitter hundreds of bird watchers travelled to Morden Bog, near Wareham, to catch a glimpse of the bird, seen on the British mainland for the first time ever

Martin Cade, of the RSPB based at Portland, Dorset, said it was highly unusual for big birds of prey to fly over large stretches of water like the English Channel.

He said: 'Southern France is as near as they normally get to Britain. They don't like crossing the water and so hardly ever reach here.

'Big birds of prey struggle to get across large areas of water as they like to have lots of lift and thermals and warm air.

'But if one of going to come to Britain then Dorset is the ideal place as it is home to six species of reptiles, three lizards and three snakes.'

The sighting will now be reported to the British Birds Rarities Committee.

Short-toed eagles have a life expectancy of 30 years. They are generally very silent but can emit a variety of musical whistling notes.

Their breeding population in Europe numbers about 8,000 pairs.
