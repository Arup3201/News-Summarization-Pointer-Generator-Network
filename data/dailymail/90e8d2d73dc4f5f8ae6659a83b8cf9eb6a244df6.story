Quizzed: Emmerdale star David Easter, 54, has been questioned by police over an alleged rape

Emmerdale star David Easter has been questioned by police over an alleged rape, it has been revealed.

The 54-year-old actor, who is the former husband of Loose Women presenter Denise Welch, was accused of carrying out the sex assault 17 years ago by a woman in her 40s.

The woman reportedly saw him on the ITV soap last December, before naming him as her alleged attacker.

Mr Easter, who played Gil Keane in the show, was interviewed under caution by Scotland Yard detectives at Sutton police station in south London on Tuesday.

However, he denies the allegations and has not been arrested, according to The Sun.

Last night, Mr Easter's lawyer, Julian Lee, said of the alleged rape: 'It relates to a woman he knew well and was not a random incident.

'The lady in question was in her thirties at the time. She saw him on Emmerdale and decided to make the complaint.'

He also stressed that the complaint had nothing to do with the Met Police's Operation Yewtree, which was launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Speaking at his house in West London yesterday, Mr Easter told reporters he had 'no comment to make'.

The father of two, who lives with his long-term partner and five-year-old son in Hanwell, West London, appeared as businessman Mr Keane in Emmerdale until last December.
