The proportion of Year 6 primary school children who are obese or overweight has fallen for the first time in six years, according to new figures

The proportion of Year 6 primary school children who are obese or overweight has fallen for the first time in six years, according to new figures.

A third of Year 6 pupils - 33.3 per cent - measured for the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in 2012/13 were obese or overweight, compared to 33.9 per cent in the previous year.

This proportion is the first recorded fall for Year 6 – 10 and 11-year-olds - in seven years.

In Reception, the number of obese and overweight children also fell in 2012/13 compared to the previous year and is lower than seven years ago.

Today’s report from the Health and Social Care Information Centre revealed that this year 9.3 per cent of Reception pupils are obese, compared to 9.9 per cent in 2006/07.

The study of 587,700 four and five-year-old children also revealed 22.2 per cent are now obese or overweight, compared to 22.9 per cent in 2006/07.

The proportion who are underweight - 0.88 per cent - is down from 1.3 per cent six years ago.

The study also included data from 489,100 Year 6 children.

It found 18.9 per cent of these children are obese this year, which is more than in 2006/07 when the figure was 17.5 per cent.

The proportion of children who are obese or overweight - 33.3 per cent - is lower than in 2011/12 - 33.9 per cent - but higher than in 2006/07 - 31.6 per cent.

The proportion who are underweight - 1.33 per cent - is down from 1.5 per cent in 2006/07.

The research also revealed that obesity prevalence among children attending schools in the most deprived areas is almost double that of the least deprived.

Some 12.1 per cent of Reception 
children attending schools in the most deprived areas are obese, 
compared to 6.4 per cent of children attending schools in the least 
deprived areas.

Just 
over 24 per cent of Year 6 children attending schools in the most 
deprived areas are obese, compared to 13 per cent of Year 6 children 
attending schools in the least deprived areas.

A third of Year 6 pupils - 33.3 per cent - measured for the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in 2012/13 were obese or overweight, compared to 33.9 per cent in the previous year

Obesity prevalence is also significantly higher among children living in urban areas than rural areas - 9.6 per cent of Reception children living in urban areas are obese compared 7.5 per cent living in village areas.

Some 19.6 per cent of Year 6 children living in urban areas are obese compared to 15.4 per cent living in village areas.

Obesity prevalence also varies by region. The lowest levels of obesity are in the south and east of England. However, the highest levels are in London.

Health and Social Care Information Centre Chair, Kingsley Manning, said: ‘These figures provide clear insight into the weight of the next generation on both a national and local scale.

‘The first drop in obesity prevalence among Year 6 stands out, although we will need to see what the numbers say in future years to determine if this is the start of a decline or more of a blip.

‘Today’s figures reflect an element of the health of our nation’s children and today’s report isn’t just of interest to people that make health policy, it will be of note to many parents in England.’

Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: 'At long last, a set of obesity figures showing a faint sign of improvement.

‘The Government is right not to be too cocky about it since at least two or three years of similar statistics are required before breaking open the champagne.

‘The country was told in 2008 that childhood obesity was levelling off but that piece of Whitehall spin met an early death.

‘Unfortunately, these figures don't tell the full story - children who are already obese are getting fatter and getting fatter earlier.’

Earlier in the year the Health and Social Care Information Centre revealed only one in three men are now classed as being a normal weight for their height.

The figures showed a 'marked increase' in obesity over the last 20 years with 65 per cent of men and 58 per cent of women now classed as overweight or obese.
