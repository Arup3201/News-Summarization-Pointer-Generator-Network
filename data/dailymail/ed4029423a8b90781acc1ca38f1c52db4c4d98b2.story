Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki was forced to defend herself after she congratulated American golf sensation Jordan Spieth on Twitter following his Masters success.

Spieth rounded off a record-breaking week by winning the first major of his career with a four-shot victory in the Masters at Augusta 

But, it didn't take long for her followers to ask whether it was a pop at former love interest Rory McIlroy as the world No 1 golfer finished strongly for fourth.

The Danish professional tennis player said: ‘Congratulations to @JordanSpieth on winning @TheMasters! Extremely impressive how he came out firing from the start and never looked back.’

Wozniacki and McIlroy dated for more than two years and were due to get married before the Northern Ireland star got cold feet just days after sending out invitations.

But 24-year-old Wozniacki was quick to explain that it was not a dig, she said: ‘Tweeps I was congratulating Spieth on his win, nothing else. It’s time for some of you to move on from the past. Thank you!’
