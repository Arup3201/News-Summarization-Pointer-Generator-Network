A forensic team has identified a further 21 victims of the Malaysia Airlines flight 17 tragedy - including one Briton.

The Dutch-led group were forced to return home after fighting in the Ukraine forced them to quit.

Two bodies had previously been identified but today Justice Ministry spokesman Jean Fransman said the bodies of 18 Dutch, two Malaysians, a Canadian, a German and a Briton had also been recovered.

The ministry added that all the victims families had been notified. 

Flight MH17 was shot down on July 17 over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard.

Pro-Russian rebels have publicly denied shooting the plane down but one top rebel has said the insurgents were involved.

A total of 228 coffins have returned to the Netherlands but it is not known how many victims that represents. 

Forensic experts at a military base in Hilversum are using DNA samples and dental records in a process expected to take months.

The recovery teams searching for bodies called off the operation yesterday because fighting was making it too dangerous, according to Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

He  promised families the search will resume in the future when the situation is 'more stable' in Ukraine and praised the effort made so far.

The Ukrainian government announced afterwards that it was suspending the ceasefire with separatist rebels at the site of the Malaysian airliner crash.

Several bodies were left lying among the wreckage for nine days after the disaster last month.

Local villagers were among some of the people seen rifling through the wreckage, which stretches across kilometres of farming villages.

Mr Rutte said the international recovery team has learned that the recovery effort undertaken by local authorities immediately after the crash was more thorough than initially thought.

The international team of Dutch, Australian and Malaysian recovery workers was unable to reach the site until July 31 because of fighting in the area between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russia separatist rebels.

A separate investigation into the cause of the crash is continuing, Rutte said.

A spokesman for the Dutch Safety Board, which is overseeing that investigation, yesterday said preliminary findings due on August 17 won't be ready until several weeks after that date.
