Andy Murray rarely talks about the Dunblane massacre because he finds it 'just too hard' to revisit the childhood trauma, he reveals in his new autobiography.

The Wimbledon champion was an eight-year-old pupil at Dunblane Primary School in March 1996 when a gunman opened fire on classrooms, killing 17 people.

However, since finding fame he has almost never spoken publicly about his memories of the shooting.

Trauma: Andy Murray, pictured with his girlfriend Kim Sears, rarely talks about the Dunblane massacre

Star: Mr Murray won Wimbledon this year, the first British man to do so for 77 years

Family: Andy Murray, bottom right, with his parents William and Judy and older brother Jamie

In his latest memoir, Seventy-Seven: My Road to Wimbledon Glory, Mr Murray says he prefers to focus on how his home town in Perthshire has rebuilt itself rather than dwelling on the past.

'It's part of my history which I can't get away from, and you can't just turn those emotions off and on for every interviewer who wants to talk to you,' he write in extracts from the book serialised by The Times.

'It's just too hard. The future is what matters most and seeing the town now, seeing how Dunblane has risen: that fills me with massive pride.'

The 26-year-old world number four adds that he was touched to hear that a pastor had used his own story to comfort the family of one of the children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Connecticut last year.

Return: In September last year, Mr Murray visited his home town of Dunblane after winning an Olympic gold medal and posed with a postbox painted gold in his honour

Crowds: The star was nervous about how he would be received, but was greeted by hundreds of well-wishers

Horror: A mother comforting her children outside Dunblane Primary School in the wake of the shooting

Mr Murray revisited Dunblane, where he owns a hotel, last year after he had won the U.S. open and a gold medal at the Olympics.

In his book, he reveals that he was 'really nervous' to return to his home town and was uncertain as to how he would be received by locals.

However, hundreds of residents flooded the streets to catch a glimpse of the tennis star, and he write of his amusement at being offered free gifts by the newsagent from whom he used to steal penny sweets as a child.

Mr Murray was pictured alongside a Dunblane postbox which had been painted gold to celebrate his Olympic medal.

He left the town as a teenager and moved to Barcelona in order to focus full time on his burgeoning tennis career.

Elsewhere in the book, he pays tribute to the steadfast support of his girlfriend Kim Sears, and explains how coach Ivan Lendl inspired him to recover from the pain of losing his first four Grand Slam finals.

Passion: Mr Murray's mother Judy has always been outspoken when it comes to tennis

Andy Murray's mother Judy has a reputation as a passionate supporter of her son - and in his new memoir, the star admits that her fiery personality has long been evident.

He denies that his mother is 'pushy', but reveals that when he was a child her competitive streak showed through and sometimes resulted in a torrent of bad language.

The British number one recounts a mixed doubles game which he and Mrs Murray played together when he was no older than 11.

Mr Murray write: 'That didn't stop Mum from having a right old swear and that's something I can see in me as well.'

Although he insists that his mother and father never pushed him to progress in his career too quickly, he praises them for allowing him to take big decisions such as moving to Spain.

His older brother Jamie, a professional tennis player who won the mixed doubles competition at Wimbledon in 2007, suffered a 'really bad experience' when he went to tennis academy aged 12, but Mr Murray says that this did not make his parents any more reluctant for him to move abroad for the sake of his career.

Seventy-Seven: My Road to Wimbledon Glory, by Andy Murray, is published on Thursday by Headline.
