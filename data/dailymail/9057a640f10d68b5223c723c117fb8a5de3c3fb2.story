Shocking: Jessica Ridgeway's family are 'disgusted' her name is being used in a political attack ad

The family of murdered Colorado schoolgirl Jessica Ridgeway are furious after a a Democratic group sent out a political attack ad that sought to capitalize on her horrific death.  

Priorities for Colorado, which is funded by a slew of unions and other liberal groups, sent out a mailer attacking Republican State House candidate Susan Kochevar, accusing her of 'refusing to cooperate' with the investigation into the 10-year-old's disappearance in October 2012.  

Jessica's grandmother Christine Ridgeway told KUSA-TV that she heard of the flyer on October 5 - the second anniversary of Jessica's kidnapping in the Denver suburb of Westminster, Colorado.

'I am just totally disgusted by this. When I first saw this I was speechless for like four hours. I was just so angry and so upset that I just couldn't speak,' she said. 

Democratic State Rep Tracy Kraft-Tharp, who is campaigning against Ms Kochevar, denounced the ad and said no one in her campaign had anything to do with it. 

Priorities Colorado spent nearly $290,000 in less than two weeks in September. Its donors include Education Reform Now, a New York-based teachers group; groups founded by Denver tech millionaire Tim Gill; and the United Food and Commercial Workers union.

Jessica stepped out her door on October 5, 2012 for a short walk to a neighbor boy's house and then to school. Her disappearance petrified her town and horrified the country. 

The FBI and local police went door-to-door questioning neighbors and asking to search homes as they hunted for Jessica and her killer. 

Ms Kochevar, who lives near Jessica's home, has revealed that FBI agents came to her door on three occasions. She said she answered their questions, but would not let them search her house. 

Police eventually arrested Austin Sigg, a 17-year-old neighbor who admitted to kidnapping Jessica, raping her and then strangling her to death before he cut her body to pieces. He is serving life in prison. 

Playing dirty: This mailer, funded by liberal group Priorities for Colorado, invokes the frantic search for Jessica Ridgeway in the name of scoring political points

Attacked: Susan Kochevar, a Republican from Jessica's hometown, is running for a seat in the State House. The ad blasted her for not letting the FBI search her home during door-to-door sweeps

Ms Kochevard has defended not letting federal agents search her house by saying that she was standing up for her Constitutional rights. 

'If one wants to have a discussion about why it is important to stand for your rights, we can have that conversation,' she said in a statement to political blog Colorado Peak Politics. 

'But to show no regard for the victim’s family is sickening.'

Mrs Ridgeway told KUSA that she doesn't blame Ms Kochevar for not letting agents into her home. But, she said the ad could turn her off politics for good.

'It's just a new level of smear that doesn't make me feel like I want to vote at all, really. I don't want to vote,' she said.
