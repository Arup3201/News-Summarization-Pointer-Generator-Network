They are extraordinary Australians with remarkable achievements, any of them deserving of the country's highest honour. 

But many state and national Australian of the Year nominees did not get the attention they deserved after Prime Minister Tony Abbott appointed Prince Philip as a Knight.

There have been reports of a backbench revolt after Mr Abbott decided to bestow the title on a man who already has more than his fair share.

Today, Daily Mail Australia presents the incredible stories of four respected Australians  listed in this year's honour roll.

LIEUTENANT GENERAL DAVID MORRISON 

Chief of Army: Lt. Gen. David Morrison's bold address to his recruits in 2013 stirred international attention

He's the straight-laced army man who is attempting to change the Australian military.

In June 2013, Chief of Army David Morrison garnered international attention for his message to recruits urging them to respect women - 'or get out'. 

His stern video message - produced after allegations Army officers were sending explicit online messages about women - went viral, both at home and internationally. 

He was showered with praise for his line: 'The standard you walk past is the standard you accept.' 

But that was just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to his efforts to transform Army culture. 

Last year alone, his efforts included a drive to recruit 600 female soldiers, work for the White Ribbon organisation and a landmark address to a United Nations Summit. 

Lt. Gen. Morrison was an ACT finalist for the Australian of the Year awards. 

The Australia Day Council noted: 'David is leading the way in ensuring that service achievements rest on talent, not gender.'

DR GILL HICKS

Terror survivor: Gill Hicks lost her legs in the 7/7/2005 London Tube bombings and became a peace campaigner

She was the last person to be rescued from the wreckage of a London train blown up by merciless terrorists in July 2005. 

But after the most unimaginably awful experience - she lost her legs and nearly died - Dr Gill Hicks has turned her attention to producing works of undeniable good. 

In the years since the calamity, Hicks became an peace campaigner, founding the organisation M.A.D. (Making A Difference) For Peace.

It encourages to people of different cultures and backgrounds to come together at community events and focus on the things people have in common.

It's a challenging job, especially given not everyone is working for the same goal.In an interview with the ABC in 2007, Ms Hicks revealed she had received hate mail from some opposed to her message of tolerance. 

Dr Hicks was a national finalist for this year's Australian of the Year awards. 

DR MIRIAM-ROSE UNGUNMERR-BAUMANN

First Indigenous teacher in the Northern Territory: Dr Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr Baumann has changed lives in her Daly River community

She only had the opportunity to attend primary school, but Dr Miriam-Rose Ungunmerr-Baumann has carved out a remarkable role in the education sector.

In 1975, she was the Northern territory's first Indigenous school teacher and in 1993 she rose to become the Principal of  St Francis Xavier Catholic School in Nauiyu, Daly River. 

Passionate about visual arts and Indigenous culture, Dr Ungunmerr-Baumann has spear-headed efforts for the arts to be taught at every school and for Indigenous people to become teachers.

Her school is now 'completely staffed and managed by Aboriginal people', according to the Jesuit Social Justice Centre, and her teaching integrates both western and traditional cultures.

She has advised governments and established centres that help women across the Daly River area. 

Unsurprisingly, Dr Ungunmerr-Baumann was a Northern Territory Finalist for Australian of the Year. 

DR ANNIE SPARROW

Health champion: Dr Annie Sparrow's passion for the most vulnerable people around the world has saved countless lives

Whether she's in Perth, in London, or in Afghanistan under the Taliban - she's the doctor whose passion for those most vulnerable has saved lives around the world.  

In her determination to help people, paediatrician Dr Annie Sparrow has worked in some of the world's most hostile environments. 

She's helped health workers fight cholera in Africa, malaria in Somalia, refugees in Woomera and Indigenous people in the outback. 

Most recently, the global health specialist has made regular visits to the besieged Syrian border to in an effort to contain a worrying series of break-outs of once rare infectious diseases, including polio. 

Dr Sparrow was a WA finalist for Australian of the Year.
