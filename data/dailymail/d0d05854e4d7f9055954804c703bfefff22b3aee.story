Dramatic footage has been released of the moment a school bus carrying 11 elementary students and a driver was hijacked at knife-point in Arkansas on Thursday morning.

It resulted in a 10-mile chase before the kidnapper finally surrendered.

Dashboard-camera video of the 20-minute pursuit and audio of the first 911 call made to authorities detail the morning chase.

The man has been identified as Nicholas John Miller, a 22-year-old man from Jacksonville who has had a history of drug abuse and run-ins with local police.

The 911 call details the events that led to the bus being stolen.

The person who called police, Karlena Lipari, was taking her child to the stop when Miller approached her, brandished a knife and demanded she take him to her vehicle.

Once the bus arrived, Lepari held back four children and attempted to alert the bus driver, 51-year-old Sheila Hart, as Miller boarded the bus.

'He got on the school bus with a knife, with the bus driver,' Lipari told the dispatcher.

Police were informed about the incident by the woman who had refused to give up her car when Miller demanded it and they eventually found the bus and pursued it north to Cabot.

Cell phone footage of the chase, recorded by 17-year-old onlooker Kelsey Eggers, shows the bus moving along a two-lane road pursued by 10 police cars with their lights flashing.

Video footage of the chase shows the bus running several red lights in busy intersections, while several law enforcement vehicles tail him.

Jacksonville and Cabot police were involved in the pursuit as well as Arkansas State Police.

Jacksonville police spokeswoman April 
Kiser said Miller pulled over only after 
seeing police spike strips on the road. The chase lasted approximately 20 minutes.

While the bus never went above 50 miles per hour during the chase, it didn't come to a complete stop until it was pulled over.

Hero: Shelia Hart, a bus driver for 20 years, said the suspect wanted to take control of the bus as police cars and sirens blared in the background. She refused and kept control of the bus the entire time

Captured: It's hard to make out but the suspect, Nicholas John Miller, 22, is finally taken into custody where he faces 16 charges

‘We were able to get the bus stopped. The suspect was taken into custody, and nobody was injured,’ Jacksonville Police Capt. Kenny Boyd told CNN.

Police managed to pull the bus over about nine miles away, where the quick-thinking bus driver, Sheila Hart, was able to set the children free.

Sheila Hart managed to free the elementary school children after the suspect stopped the hijacked bus.

'He said, ‘How do you open this door,’' Hart told KARK-TV. 'And I said, ‘That green light right there.’'And when he went to punch the button, I grabbed the babies and said, ‘Let’s go!’'

According to an arrest report, Miller
told authorities that people were after him and that he needed to take 
the bus to save his life.

He said he had no plans to hurt any of the children – who attend Pinewood Elementary School in Jacksonville - or the driver.

Miller
faces 16 felony charges stemming from the chase including a felony 
count of vehicle piracy, 12 felony counts of kidnapping, and two felony 
counts of aggravated assault.

The
incident is not his first brush with the law this year and just earlier
this month he was charged with Terroristic Threatening following a 
domestic dispute.

Police stopped the bus roughly 20 minutes after the hijacking began, Miller was arrested and no one on-board was injured

According to a police report, nine days ago a woman told police Miller was high on methamphetamine and that he had assaulted and threatened to kill her if she took his son away.

In May, according to a police report, Miller was arrested on suspicion of breaking and entering a vehicle, and stealing a shotgun and money. He was sentenced in September to 24 months of probation.

In September, Miller was pulled over for having tags displayed incorrectly on the license plate of the car he was driving.

After discovering Miller had a warrant out for his arrest, the officer requested a K-9 Unit to conduct a sweep of the vehicle, which subsequently turned up a syringe with residue on it in the center console, according to the report. Miller was arrested on the warrant and for possession of drug paraphernalia.

In each of the incident reports, Miller was listed as a warehouse worker for a supply company.
