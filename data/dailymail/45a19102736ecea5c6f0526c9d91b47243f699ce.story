Roy Hodgson will attempt to persuade Steven Gerrard to continue his international career until 2016 - leaving the England captain with a hard choice between the needs of club and country, with Liverpool playing in the Champions League next season.

Though Gerrard, 34, has struggled at times at the World Cup, the value to the squad of his experience means that Hodgson would want him to continue, given that so many youngsters are emerging in the team.

With Frank Lampard about to retire from international football, Gerrard is one of the few senior pros left and England will not want to lose him as he provides a degree of balance to the youthful enthusiasm of the squad.

However, Gerrard will consider the needs of his club, who have a much heavier fixture schedule next season after qualifying for the Champions League. Gerrard has said he will make his decision only after speaking to his friends, family and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers after the World Cup.

Rodgers’s views will be important — and it seems likely the Liverpool manager and the club’s medical staff would prefer Gerrard to use international breaks as rest weeks.

Given Hodgson’s desire to keep Gerrard, the captain is expected to win his 114th cap in the dead-rubber match against Costa Rica on Tuesday. Even though the FA chairman Greg Dyke has guaranteed Hodgson a job until 2016 despite England’s exit, three defeats at the World Cup would damage the manager’s credibility further, so it remains a vital game.

Given Costa Rica’s wins over Uruguay and Italy, Hodgson seems likely to adjust the tactics that have seen England exposed defensively — losing the game would bring further humiliation.

If that is the case,  England could revert to a more conservative 4-3-3 formation with Ross Barkley and Jordan Henderson ahead of Gerrard, Wayne Rooney up front and Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana wide. That would give England more bodies in midfield where they have struggled against both Italy and Uruguay.

England’s campaign is their worst at a World Cup finals since 1958, when they failed to get out of the group, though then they drew all three matches and finished joint second in their group.
