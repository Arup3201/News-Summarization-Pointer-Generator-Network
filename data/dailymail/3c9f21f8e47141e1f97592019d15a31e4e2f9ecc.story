Kellie Maloney has revealed that David Beckham spurred her on to become a woman.

Maloney – formerly known as Frank– said the footballer’s metrosexual style made it more acceptable for her to visit beauty parlours.

The 61-year-old admitted that at first she would buy dresses only to throw them away, having been too embarrassed to wear them. ‘I just kept it locked up,’ she said.

‘I’d
 go into a shop, buy something and I’d come out and feel horrified. I’d 
just throw it straight in the bin. I wouldn’t even put them on, I’d just
 throw them in the bin – it was just a release.’

However, she said 
Beckham’s well-documented love of male grooming – and the subsequent 
mainstream acceptance of facials, massages and waxing for both sexes – 
encouraged her to take the next step. She explained in an interview on 
Good Morning  Britain: ‘When David Beckham came out, when they started  
waxing themselves and everything else, I thought “this is good, I can go
 to the beauty parlour now”, I can do things like that and I can say 
“well, David Beckham does it, all these footballers do it, what does it 
matter?”’

Maloney, a former boxing manager who guided Lennox Lewis 
to the world heavyweight title, revealed at the weekend that she was now
 living as a woman. She retired from boxing in October – claiming to 
have fallen out of love with the sport.

In fact, she had walked away
 to begin preparing for her new life as a woman. Maloney, who has three 
daughters from two marriages, is now more than a year into the 
transition period.

Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery.

So far Maloney has undergone hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling.

Fame and fortune: Maloney was one of Britain's great boxing promoters and made huge sums from the success of Lennox Lewis (pictured together after a win in Atlantic City in 2007)

Release: Kellie said when her father died four years ago it lifted the lid and helped her eventually start her journey

‘Living
 with the burden any longer would have killed me,’ she said. ‘The 
feeling of wanting to be like and dress like a woman has always been 
there. I consciously made the decision that I wouldn’t dress like a 
woman, but it was a constant urge.’

Maloney also admitted she knew from 
the age of three she was born in the wrong body but kept it hidden for 
decades fearing being branded 'a pervert'.

'It was probably when I was three or four I knew I was different,'

Treat: Kellie said that the first thing she did was get her ears pierced when the news broke

'I didn't like what I saw of myself in the mirror, but I thought it must just be something in my head. 

'I feared being seen as a freak, a pervert. I felt I didn't want to be different. I thought it'd just go but it didn't.'

After 'living in the shadows' the 'lid came off the day my father died four years ago', she said.

'I’d
 been having counselling for ten years and I used to phone up the 
counsellor, I’d only do it on the phone because I didn’t want anyone to 
know who I was and I would say to this counsellor, "tell me I’m not a 
transsexual", and he said, "well I can’t tell you that but you keep 
phoning so there must be something there", and it just took, I don’t 
know, I couldn’t get rid of it. 

'I
 think I would have killed myself if I hadn't come out. I was angry with
 my children, my wife, it was destroying my relationships. That's what 
made me do it'.

Maloney said the hardest part was telling second wife Tracey. The pair are now separated, but remain ‘very good friends’.

'We’re separated now, divorced, but she’s very supportive. One of the saddest things, when it was coming out of my mouth, when I was telling her, I wanted to sort of catch it and put it back in, and I realised once I’d said it and we looked at each other, we knew that our marriage was over.

'But we are very good friends and we’re soul mates still, and my children have been first class. My eldest daughter has really been with me. Sophie is with me today, my 19 year old, and my young 13 year old, she’s really good. I’ve got a great team of support around me - TG [transgender] pals, everyone has been really fantastic.'

Maloney, who has three daughters from two marriages, is now more than a year into the transition period, learning to live as a different gender.

Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery.

So far the process has involved secret hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling. 

Kellie had hoped to live secretly as a woman for 18 months before releasing a book next year about her journey.

But she was betrayed by someone in her support group.

'I have said it was like living in the shadows. I didn't want to leave the house and for a while I started living as Frank again'.

She said today she felt happy and liberated by what has happened since.

'On
 Sunday (when the story came out) it was a great release. I had always 
wanted to get my ears pierced but thought it would make things too 
obvious. The first thing I did was get my ears pierced'. 

Asked
 how she felt about any negative comments, she said: 'I received so many
 of them in my boxing business they'd just be like water off a duck's 
back now to me. Really, that life has prepared me for this transition.'

Maloney, famous for wearing Union flag suits in the ring, guided Lewis to the undisputed world heavyweight title during a successful 30-year career and her former charge has backed her since she spoke out to the Sunday Mirror.

Lewis said previously: 'I was just as shocked as anyone at the news about my former promoter and my initial thought was that it was a wind-up.

'However, having taken some time to read Kellie's statements, I understand better what she, and others in similar situations, are going through. I think that all people should be allowed to live their lives in a way that brings them harmony and inner peace.

'I respect Kellie's decision and say that if this is what brings about true happiness in her life, than so be it.'
