Bayern Munich midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger is primed to make his first competitive appearance since helping Germany win the World Cup.

Bayern coach Pep Guardiola says Schweinsteiger is in the squad for Saturday's home game against Hoffenheim, though 'I don't know if he will play from the start.'

The Spaniard says 'he can help us a lot with his experience.'

Schweinsteiger had been labouring with a nagging patellar tendon problem in his left knee. He aggravated the injury in a pre-season friendly in August.

Despite his injury concerns, Schweinsteiger was named Germany captain following Bayern team-mate Philipp Lahm's international retirement.

Meanwhile, Lahm has been ruled out for up to three months after breaking his right ankle in training on Tuesday.
