Unidentified material that washed ashore in Australia and is being examined for any link to the lost Malaysian plane is unlikely to have come from the jet, an official revealed today.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau had been scrutinising photos of the object, which washed ashore six miles east of Augusta in Western Australia state.

But Martin Dolan, chief commissioner of the bureau, said an initial analysis of the material - which appeared to be sheet metal with rivets - suggested it was not from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

Mr Dolan said: ‘We do not consider 
this likely to be of use to our search for MH370. At this stage, we are 
not getting excited.’

He added that the analysis of the material would likely be completed overnight and a formal statement issued tomorrow.

Augusta is near Australia's south-western tip, about 190 miles from Perth, where the search has been headquartered.

Meanwhile,
 Australia's prime minister said today that failure to find any clue in 
the most likely crash site of the lost jet would not spell the end of 
the search.

This was because officials plan soon to bring in more powerful sonar equipment that can delve deeper beneath the Indian Ocean.

The
 search coordination centre said a robotic submarine, the U.S. Navy's 
Bluefin 21, had scanned more than 80 per cent of the 120-sq mile seabed 
search zone off the Australian west coast, creating a three-dimensional 
sonar map of the ocean floor. Nothing of interest had been found.

The
 2.8-mile deep search area is a circle 12 miles wide around an area 
where sonar equipment picked up a signal on April 8 consistent with a 
plane's black boxes. But the batteries powering those signals are now 
believed dead.

Defence 
minister David Johnston said Australia was consulting with Malaysia, 
China and the US on the next phase of the search for the plane, which 
disappeared on March 8. Details on the next phase are likely to be 
announced next week.

Mr 
Johnston said more powerful towed side-scan commercial sonar equipment 
would probably be deployed, similar to the remote-controlled subs that 
found RMS Titanic 12,500f under the Atlantic Ocean in 1985 and the 
Australian WWII wreck HMAS Sydney in the Indian Ocean off the Australian
 coast, north of the current search area, in 2008.

‘The
 next phase, I think, is that we step up with potentially a more 
powerful, more capable side-scan sonar to do deeper water,’ Mr Johnston 
said.

While the Bluefin had
 less than one-fifth of the seabed search area to complete, Mr Johnston 
estimated that task would take another two weeks.

Australian
 Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the airliner's probable impact zone was
 430 miles long and 50 miles wide. A new search strategy would be 
adopted if nothing is found in the current seabed search zone.

‘If
 at the end of that period we find nothing, we are not going to abandon 
the search, we may well rethink the search, but we will not rest until 
we have done everything we can to solve this mystery,’ Mr Abbott told 
reporters.

‘We owe it to 
the families of the 239 people on board, we owe it to the hundreds of 
millions - indeed billions - of people who travel by air to try to get 
to the bottom of this.

'We will not rest until we have done everything we can to solve this mystery'

Tony Abbott, Australian Prime Minister

‘The
 only way we can get to the bottom of this is to keep searching the 
probable impact zone until we find something or until we have searched 
it as thoroughly as human ingenuity allows at this time.’

The
 focus of the next search phase will be decided by continuing analysis 
of information including flight data and sound detections of the 
suspected beacons, Mr Johnston said.

‘A
 lot of this seabed has not even been hydrographically surveyed before -
 some of it has - but we're flying blind,’ he said, adding that the 
seabed in the vicinity of the search was up to four miles deep.

The
 search centre said an air search involving 10 planes was suspended for a
 second day because of heavy seas and poor visibility.

But 12 ships would join Wednesday's search of an expanse covering 14,500 sq miles, centred 1,000 miles north-west of Perth.

Radar
 and satellite data show the jet veered far off course on March 8 for 
unknown reasons during its flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to 
Beijing.

An analysis 
indicates it would have run out of fuel in the remote section of ocean 
where the search has been focused. Not one piece of confirmed debris has
 been found since the massive multinational hunt began.
