A California couple who bought the house where Walt Disney was born 112 years ago plan to turn it into a historical site and museum.

Brent Young and his wife Dina Benadon bought the home and hope it will serve as a 'community resource with a mission of enhancing and exploring childhood creativity.'

The couple, who run a Los Angeles animation studio, said restoration is scheduled to start next month, and hope the project can be completed by what would have been Disney's 113th birthday, on December 5, 2014.

Walt Disney birthplace: This house in Chicago's Hermosa neighborhood is the childhood home of the legendary animator

Walt's childhood bedroom? Disney lived in the home, which his father built and his mom designed, until he was 4 years old

Good deal? The new owners Brent Young and Dina Benadon bought the home for $173,000 after it sat on, and sometimes off, the market for 6 years

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel declared December 5, which is the late animator's birthday, Walt Disney Day in the city

The development so thrilled Chicago leaders that Mayor Rahm Emanuel actually marked it by declaring the day Walt Disney Day.

The couple announced on their website that they hope to raise $500,000 for the renovations, with donors receiving prizes, ranging from having their names listed in a book in the house to a one-night stay there.

The two-flat home is located in the Hermosa neighborhood on Chicago's northwest side. It's said to have been designed by Disney's mother, Flora, and built by his carpenter father, Elias.

Walt and his brother, Roy, were born there and lived there until Walt was 4 years old.

On
 Benadon and Young's website, Roy Patrick Disney, Roy Disney's grandson,
 said the family was pleased that the house was 'being restored to its 
humble origins.'

The circa 1890s house sold for $173,000 in June after six years of going on and off the market.

'That
 these two amazing men came out of that average neighborhood — anyone 
can do it,' Benadon told the Chicago Tribune. 'There seems to be a great
 symbol for the neighborhood and for Chicago and the American Dream.'

Historic home? The home has never been granted historic status, partially because of extensive renovations that removed the 1890s charms

Young and Benadon intend to turn the home into a 'historical site, museum and a community resource with the mission of enhancing and exploring childhood creativity'

'That these two amazing men came out of that average neighborhood ¿ anyone can do it,' Benadon said, referring to Disney's brother and business partner Roy

'There seems to be a great symbol for the neighborhood and for Chicago and the American Dream,' Benadon said of the home's rich history

Hopeful home: The couple and their renovation team have launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise $500,000 for renovations

When Disney's father built the home, Hermosa--now a predominantly working class, Hispanic area--was a new Chicago neighborhood.

Because of subsequent renovations and, according to Curbed, Disney's 'well-documented bigotry,' a mid-90s landmarks committee chose not to grant the home landmark status.

Young and Benadon hope to change that and win landmark status.

'We're hoping that there's something in there,' Young said. 'Walt's original cartoon drawings of the little mouse in the corner, maybe.'
