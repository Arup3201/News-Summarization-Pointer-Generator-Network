A cat named Elliot was found alive after being impaled with an arrow and now animal control is searching for the person who used him as target practice.

The mayor of Norwich, Connecticut found Elliot on a porch near the animal's home while campaigning on Monday.

'I was angry. I wanted to hit someone,' Mayor Peter Nystrom told The Bulletin.

Retribution: Mayor Nystrom says he was so angry after finding the cat, that he wanted to hit someone. He ended up helping Elliot's owner pay for veterinarian bills to remove the arrow

Mr Nystrom called police and Elliot was taken to All Friends Animal Hospital where veterinarian Kathleen Tangari performed surgery to remove the arrow lodged in the cat's upper torso.

She says Elliot survived because the tissue hardened around the entry and exit points which prevented him from bleeding to death. It also didn't puncture any vital organs.

'It completely missed the jugular, the lungs, the heart, and both bones on each side,' Dr Tangari told WTNH. 'It's unbelievable.'

'It's a miracle that arrow missed everything inside of him. That cat was meant to survive, as far as I'm concerned,' Mayor Nystrom said.

Dr Tangari estimates that Elliot was shot two days before being found and was sitting at the time of the attack.  The arrow's position within Elliot's body meant that the cat couldn't curl up at night to keep warm.

Luckily, Dr Tangari was able to completely remove the arrow and Elliot is recovering though he may have sustained some permanent nerve damage.

Despite being the target of a cruel human act, the cat is still friendly towards people.

'He didn't once try to bite or act vicious. And I wouldn't have blamed him. He's been in a lot of pain,' hospital co-owner Lona Harelle told WFSB.

Ms Harelle said that Elliot should be able to go home to his owner, Marian Mann, by the end of this week.

Ms Mann, who is elderly, wasn't able to afford Elliot's medical bills so Mayor Nystrom stepped in to pay for them.

Authorities believe that the cat was used as target practice judging by the type of arrow used.

'Somebody did this intentionally,' Animal Control Officer Michele Kellough told The Hartford Courant. 'It's not like a gun; an arrow does not go off by itself.'

Animal Control is currently investigating and hoping to catch the person or people responsible.

Residents in the area where the cat was found told The Bulletin that dozens of local cats have gone missing in the past two weeks to a month, but no others have been found with arrow wounds.
