Mike Tyson appears to have backed Manny Pacquiao to win his highly-anticipated bout against Floyd Mayweather by insisting his fellow countryman will struggle to deal with the Filipino's pace.

Mayweather is the bookmakers' favourite to win the Las Vegas showdown however Tyson believes the undefeated American will have to be at his best if he is to extend his unbeaten run.

Former undisputed heavyweight champion of the world Tyson said: 'When you think about the two fighters, the only people who gave Manny Pacquiao the most difficult time of his career are people who throw 100 punches a round - Timothy Bradley Jnr and Juan Manuel Marquez.

'Floyd doesn't throw anywhere near 100 punches a round. He is more of a scientific fighter, he really plots a lot, he poses whereas Pacquiao is feinting and moving around. That's just my opinion, Pacquiao has perpetual motion he's all over the god damn place.

'Floyd has to fight in the first couple of rounds, he's going to lose the rounds if he's laid back. He has to come out punching, keep the jab and spin with him.'

The two fighters will go toe-to-toe at the MGM Grand on May 2 in a fight which is worth $300m.
