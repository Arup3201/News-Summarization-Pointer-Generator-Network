Toronto's controversial Mayor Rob Ford, running
a tightly contested race for re-election in October, was
admitted to hospital Wednesday with what turned out to be a suspected tumor.

Ford, 45, who gained international notoriety after a
well-publicized battle with addiction to crack-cocaine and alcohol, went to a Toronto
hospital, complaining of abdominal pain that had lasted three
months and worsened over the past 24 hours, eventually becoming 'unbearable,' Humber River hospital
said in a statement.

'Examination and investigation has resulted in a working
diagnosis of a tumor,' said Dr. Rueben Devlin, the hospital's
president. 'The mayor has been admitted to allow for further
investigation to obtain a definitive diagnosis.'

Health scare: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford was hospitalized with a suspected abdominal tumor Wednesday 

Medical emergency: Ford was transported to Humber River Hospital complaining of abdominal pain that had lasted three months and worsened over the past 24 hours

Ford became famous globally after admitting in November that
he had smoked crack while in a 'drunken stupor.' He entered a
rehabilitation facility in May. 

Throughout the ensuing scandal, which became fodder for late-night TV hosts, he said he would stand for re-election and has
campaigned energetically.

Ford did not show up at City Hall Wednesday. but he appeared to be in good spirits during a debate on Tuesday night.

Dennis Morris, Ford's lawyer and a family friend, said he spoke to the mayor the other day and he didn't mention any abdominal pain.

During a press conference Wednesday night, Dr Reuben Devlin told the assembled reporters that at this time it remains unknown whether the growth in Ford's abdomen is benign or malignant. 

'First, we have to decide what the tumor is and then we can decide on the treatment that is required,' he was quoted as saying. 

Devlin said they need to determine what type of tumor it is by doing a biopsy. He said he could not say how long Ford will be in the hospital.

Devlin said the CT scan is ‘very definitive for the tumor’ but a ‘definitive diagnosis’ is still to come.

The 45-year-old politician is married with two children. 

The mayor, who came to power pledging to cut waste at city
hall and keep a lid on taxes, has a core base of suburban
support. An Aug. 28 poll showed Ford gaining ground over
challengers. 

Ford's recent medical history includes several hospitalizations.

All smiles: Ford completed a stint at a rehab center in July and proclaimed himself as 'healthy as a horse' 

As recently as July, he was treated for what was described as a toe injury, which will require surgery.

In 2012, Ford was hospitalized with a pain in his throat; the year before, he required medical attention due to kidney stones, CBC.ca reported. 

Prior to his mayoral victory in 2010, then-Councillor Ford underwent emergency surgery to remove a tumor on his appendix, which ultimately had to be cut out as well, along with a part of his colon.

Doug Ford Sr., the mayor's farther, died of colon cancer in 2006. 

After emerging from a rehab center in July, Ford proclaimed himself as 'healthy as a horse.' 

On Tuesday, a smiling Rob Ford met with former boxing champion Mike Tyson, who endorsed the mayor, calling him the finest leader in Toronto's history.

Councilor Doug Ford, the mayor's brother and campaign manager, said Rob is in good spirits.

Doug Ford sidestepped questions about the mayoral race, saying he would speak about the campaign on Thursday. Although campaigning has been underway for months, the official deadline for candidates to sign up is Friday.

That leaves time for Doug Ford, a city councilor, to step in for his brother, a possibility some have long speculated about.

Doug deflected a question about Rob's previous health issues, saying only that he complained of stomach pain while the two had breakfast.

‘He said his stomach was bothering him. He went to the doctor's and the doctor sent him over to Humber,’ Doug Ford said.

Olivia Chow, who is running to replace Ford, tweeted that her thoughts and hopes are with Ford and his family for good news in the days ahead. John Tory, considered the front runner in the race, wished Ford a speedy recovery.

‘My thoughts are with Mayor Ford, Renata, their children and the entire Ford family this evening,’ Tory said in a statement.
