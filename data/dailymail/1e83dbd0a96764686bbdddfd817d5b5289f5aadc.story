Hats off for the man who hatted the famous Cat!

Beloved children’s author Dr Seuss had a fabled collection of wacky and wonderful hats all his own that inspired the famous headwear of the Cat in the Hat, among many others.

The collection of hundreds of hats was secretly stored in a closet, hidden behind a bookshelf in his home in San Diego, but can now be seen by the public for the first time.

Oh, the hats you'll wear: Dr Seuss had a legendary hat collection that was hidden in a secret closet in his home; for the first time, a selection of the beloved authors many toppers are on display at the NYPL

The cat in the hat: Variations on Dr Seuss' hats were prominently featured in the author's children's books, including 'The Cat in the Hat,' left, and 'The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins,' right

The writer– real name Theodor Seuss Geisel – was known among his social circles for his collection of hundreds of hats, which he would often wear at dinner parties and when he was penning his latest books.

The prolific children’s author, cartoonist, and artist owned hundreds of hats in all shapes and sizes, and insisted that his guests wear some of the least conventional ones when at his home.

His wife, Audrey Geisel, said in a 1999 interview that these hats were the life of the party. ‘Believe me, when you get a dozen people seated at a fairly formal dinner party and they’ve all got on perfectly ridiculous chapeaus, the evening takes care of itself.’

The legendary collection is being displayed for the first time in an exhibit at the New York Public Library, at the Children’s Center on 42nd St in Manhattan in honor of the 75th anniversary of ‘The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins.’

Included in his collection are a Baroque
Czech helmet, a colonel’s hat from WWII, and a feathered red felt hat 
that no doubt inspired one of Bartholomew’s many hats.

He was also gifted a faux-fur marching band hat from San Diego State University in 1986.

The
author was born in 1904 in Springfield, Massachusetts and later 
attended Oxford University, where he met Helen Palmer, who would become 
his wife in 1927.

As the New York Times notes,
hats were much more common at the last turn of the century, but even 
so, Geisel favored hats with a flair, and would find the most 
ostentatious head wear he could find.

The exhibit is currently being displayed at the main branch of the New York Public Library at Bryant Park. The next exhibit stop is New York's Animazing Gallery from February 13-17.
