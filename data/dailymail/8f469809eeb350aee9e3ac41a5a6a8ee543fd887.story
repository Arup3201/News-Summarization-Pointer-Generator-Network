An elderly truck driver who killed a 43-year-old woman and injured her mother as they walked on a New York street will not face criminal charges.

Police said James McDonald, 86, veered across East Genesee St in Syracuse, hitting college professor Jennifer Cook and her mother, Barbara Cook, in March.

Jennifer Cook died in a nearby hospital, while her 72-year-old mother suffered critical injuries but was later released.

McDonald, however, has not been charged over the death. He was let off with a ticket for passing a red light and failing to keep right, Syracuse Police Sergeant Gary Bulinski told Syracuse.com.

Sgt Bulinksi said police actively investigated the crash and neither McDonald's age or the weather seemed to be factors.

He said McDonald, from Chittenago, held a valid driver's license and was not involved in recent accidents. The road was also clear.

McDonald refused to comment when contacted by Syracuse.com.

'I don't care to talk about it, sorry,' he said before hanging up.

The tragic incident unfolded on March 14 when Jennifer Cook and her mother were walking to a restaurant for lunch after a doctor's visit about 1.15pm.

Cook, a Rhode Island College English professor, was in Central New York to visit her dying 93-year-old father, Frank Cook.

Syracuse.com reported that McDonald plowed into the Cooks after swerving to avoid rear-ending a stationary vehicle ahead of him.

The women were rushed to Upstate University Hospital where Jennifer Cook, from Rhode Island, died from her injuries.

Her father Frank Cook died two weeks later.

Jennifer Cook's tragic death shocked and saddened students and staff at Rhode Island College, where she'd worked since 2004.

'Dr. Jennifer Cook was a well-liked and well-respected member of the English department and of the educational studies department,' college president Nancy Carriulo said in a statement, according to Providence Journal.Â 

'We all thought that Jen, who was tenured a few years ago, had a long career ahead of her at Rhode Island College.'

Cook, who received degrees from American University and the University of Massachusetts, was the executive director of the Rhode Island Writing Project which worked to train young teachers.

'She was a really extraordinary teacher. She had such an amazing impact on her students,' Ronald Pitt, vice president of academic affairs at RIC, told Providence Journal. 'It was an amazing thing to see her work.'

English department chair, Daniel Scott, said Cook 'inspired and trained hundreds of students who are now teachers in Rhode Island and around the country'.

Cook is survived by her spouse, Moira Collins, who is also a professor.
