Real Madrid are continuing to monitor David de Gea's impressive form at Manchester United.

There had been increasing clamour in Spain for 23-year-old De Gea to replace the under-fire Iker Casillas in the national side and Madrid are considering a similar move at club level.

United, though, are planning discussions over an improved contract with their goalkeeper and hope to ratify a new long-term deal soon.

De Gea dislodged Iker Casillas between the sticks for Spain during the recent win against Luxembourg 

The 23-year-old was largely untroubled during the comfortable 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win

De Gea, who was player of the year last season, signed for £17.8million in June 2011 and his deal runs out in 2016. 

Although initial conversations took place last year, talks had been put on hold as United strengthened their squad in other areas. 

Louis van Gaal still wants another goalkeeper to provide competition for De Gea with Anders Lindegaard looking for a new club.

However, Real see the former Atletico No 1 as the man to replace Casillas, just as he did for Spain in the 4-0 win over Luxembourg.  

Meanwhile, Ryan Giggs will be given the Legend of Football Award at the HMV Football Extravaganza on Tuesday at the London Hilton Hotel on Park Lane. 

Giggs follows last year's recipient Pele while other former winners include Sir Bobby Charlton, Sir Alex Ferguson and Eric Cantona.
