Siem Reap in Cambodia, Fort Lauderdale in Florida and the Greek island of Mykonos are being tipped as the new holiday destinations to watch, according to new research.

While their neighbours Thailand, Miami and Santorini have been more popular in the past with travellers, these far-flung destinations are rising in popularity, global travel search website Skyscanner reports.

Siem Reap in the north west of Cambodia tops the list with a 33 per cent increase in searches from the UK, followed closely by Fort Lauderdale, Florida (32 per cent) and Mykonos (31 per cent).

Travel experts say that with a wide choice of upmarket hotels springing up alongside backpacker hostels, Siem Reap is set to become the hot new destination for 2015 for both backpackers on a budget and luxury travellers.

Fort Lauderdale is now regenerating itself to attract a more sophisticated crowd thanks to investments in its infrastructure, including a £500 million expansion of its airport, a new high speed rail station and the creation of ultra-luxury accommodation including a Conrad Hotel.

Mykonos is also experiencing a revival in popularity after international celebrities including  Jennifer Lopez and Lindsay Lohan flocked to the Greek party town and its luxury hotels.

New direct flights from Heathrow and endorsements from Superstar DJs such as Afrojack, who has claimed that tourists will get a 'cheaper and more fun' experience in Mykonos than Ibiza, helped secure Mykonos a place in the top three.

The predictions are based on the analysis of millions of Skyscanner flight searches over the last three years, combined with research carried out by futurology companies, The Future Laboratory and Trendhunter providing additional insight on consumer trends and influences.

Mary Porter, of Skyscanner, said: 'It is really interesting to see how people's travel interests are changing.
