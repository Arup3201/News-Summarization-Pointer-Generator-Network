A mother fighting cancer cannot hug her three children because her treatment has made her radioactive.

Emma Day, 27, has taken  high doses of iodine as part of her treatment for thyroid cancer.

This meant she had to be placed in isolation at the hospital, with staff banned from going within three metres of her for five days.

For three weeks she had to stay at least two metres from the children meaning she had to watch from a distance while her husband, Jon, played with them

However, she says that life has been 
even more frustrating since she was allowed home. She must avoid her 
six-year-old daughter and one-year-old twins for three more weeks, as 
bodily contact could cause them lasting damage.

‘It is very hard because the twins are too young to understand,’ said Mrs Day.

‘My oldest daughter saw a cancer 
psychologist who explained to her that my treatment was necessary, and 
she understands why, because it’ll make me better.

Mrs Day had to take high doses of iodine as part of her treatment for thyroid cancer. This was the second time she had fought cancer as she suffered from leukaemia as a child

'I breast-fed my twins for about five 
months after they were born, and I’m not used to being away from them. 
It’s very hard. I’m missing them so much.

‘I thought it was hard in hospital, 
but it is so much harder now because I can see them but I know I cannot 
touch them or cuddle them or go near them.

‘I can’t cuddle anybody at the moment, and it’s heartbreaking.

‘I have to navigate around the house while keeping a safe distance from my children.

‘We are a very close family and three 
weeks seems like such a long time, but it will be worth it.’ It is Mrs 
Day’s second battle with cancer. She overcame leukaemia as a child.

She had now been given the all-clear and can cuddle her children again - she will have another scan in six months time to ensure that the cancer has not returned

Tough: Emma Day must stay at least a metre away from her three children for the next three weeks

She was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in January after seeing a doctor for a lump in her throat.

She initially thought she had a 
swollen gland, but doctors at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital soon 
realised the growth was cancerous after an operation to remove half of 
the lump.

For her particular type of cancer, patients receive radioactive iodine treatment – a form of internal radiotherapy.

The treatment involves a radioactive 
form of the element called iodine 131, administered as a drink or 
capsule, which circulates throughout the body in the bloodstream.

Thyroid cancer cells pick up the 
iodine wherever they are in the body, and the radiation kills them. 
Other cells are left unaffected, because only thyroid cells take up the 
iodine.

She says that being home with her family in Cheltenham - but unable to go near them - is in some ways worse than when she was on her own in hospital

While she was in an isolation unit in Cheltenham General Hospital, staff were not allowed to go within three metres of her for five days

Emma's husband John has now taken a month off work to care for their three children. She said: 'I can't cuddle anybody at the moment, and it's heartbreaking. I have to navigate around the house while keeping a safe distance from my children'

The treatment rendered Mrs Day so radioactive that anything she touched in hospital has been thrown away.

While the powerful treatment is also dangerous to the patient, the risk from the cancer itself is judged to be greater.

The mother of three, from Cheltenham, 
said the thought of holding her children in her arms again has given her
 the courage to go on.

She said that, during her time in 
hospital isolation, she received support from dozens of people who 
followed her online blog and kept in touch with her via phone.

‘I have had so much support – it’s 
amazing,’ she said. ‘Now I just can’t wait to get back to normal and hug
 and kiss my children again.’

Radioactive iodine treatment is a type 
of internal radiotherapy. The treatment uses a radioactive form of 
iodine called iodine 131 (I-131). The radioactive iodine circulates 
throughout the body in the bloodstream.

Radioactive iodine treatment is a type of internal radiotherapy, administered as a capsule or drink

Thyroid cancer cells pick up 
the iodine wherever they are in the body. The radiation in the iodine 
then kills the cancer cells.

Radioactive iodine is a targeted treatment. It doesn't affect other body cells, because only thyroid cells take up the iodine.

The treatment is usually administered as a drink or capsule.

Patients having radioactive iodine treatment in hospital are looked after in a single room until their radiation levels have fallen again.

The treatment causes the patient to be slightly 
radioactive for a few days, so time spent with staff and visitors
 is minimal.

Sweat and urine also become radioactive, so bedsheets are changed every day and patients have to flush the loo more than once.

Pregnant women and 
young children will not be allowed to visit.

Even 12 weeks after treatment, patients who have had radiactive idodine therapy may set off radiation alarms at airports.
