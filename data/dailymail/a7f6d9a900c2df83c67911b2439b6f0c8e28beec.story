Con: Faraque Ahmed used the name of his make-up artist sister Ruby Hammer to help con women out of £200,000

The brother of top make-up artist Ruby Hammer has been jailed for six years in his absence after swindling 'naive' women out of more than £200,000.

Faraque Ahmed, 47, persuaded two victims to plough their savings into bogus high-profit schemes, including a fake investment account with Goldman Sachs, before gambling away their fortunes.

Ahmed was granted bail after he surrendered his passport last year, but applied for a new one and is now thought to have fled to Zambia.

The conman had claimed he was as successful as his sister, who was awarded an MBE in 2007 for founding Ruby and Millie, and has appeared on TV shows including This Morning, GMTV, Britain's Next Top Model and 10 Years Younger.

He also lied about being friends with a host of celebrities and owning three luxury flats in Marble Arch, central London, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

Ahmed then convinced Shanaz Parveen that he was a fitness instructor for wealthy clients including Elton John's partner, David Furnish, tricking her out of £148,000 after promising her 33 per cent returns on a 'commodities' investment, leaving her saddled with debt.

Lynn Anderson was also persuaded to hand over £75,000 to a non-existent US-based clothing company.

A jury of seven men and five women took just 20 minutes to find Ahmed guilty of seven counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three counts of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception, and six counts of obtaining property by deception.

He was cleared of a single count of obtaining property by deception, relating to Gurpreet Singh, after allegedly conning him into paying £5,000 towards a 'minerals venture'.

Sentencing Judge Joanna Korner QC branded Ahmed a 'danger to women' and said: 'He persuaded two women to invest large sums of money in non-existent shares to benefit himself.

'When listed for trial before Christmas he indicated a plea of guilty - but he he falsely obtained a new passport and fled.

'The evidence in this case is so overwhelming, it is not surprising he indicated a guilty plea.

'This was disgraceful behaviour. He took advantage of two ladies who were naive and persuaded them through his charms and wealth to trust him.

'It was planned and well thought-out.

'Previous convictions show he is a professional trickster who not long before completed a sentence for identical offences.

'It's clear the only sentence is custodial and lengthy'.

Earlier prosecutor Lee Schama told the court: 'It's really very simple - Faraque Ahmed conned or talked people into giving him money.

'He used other people's bank accounts to store the money.

'Faraque Ahmed is a man who talked a great deal about his sister, Ruby Hammer.

'Faraque Ahmed used to tell people about that, persuading them he was also rich and successful.'

Lies: Ruby Hammer's brother used her name and that of other celebrities to manipulate victims and take their cash

Giving evidence, Ms Parveen told how Ahmed 'randomly' approached her shopping at Selfridges in Oxford Street, claiming to be a fitness instructor looking for new clients.

'He kept talking about his famous sister Ruby Hammer and how he was incredibly wealthy.

'He said he had no intention of running away with my money because he had plenty of his own.

'He claimed to know a lot of famous people and he claimed he was going to be training Elton John's partner.

'He always named famous people and said he went to an MTV awards party and mingled with a lot of famous people.

'It all stacked up from what he was showing me.'

After informing Ms Parveen about a 'great opportunity' and guaranteeing she would never lose her cash, Ahmed bombarded her with calls to persuade her to liquidise assets, stocks and shares and even sell her house.

She was told any profit would be 'reinvested' and that the schemes made 'financial sense', jurors heard.

Any request for documents would be fobbed off with excuses, Ms Parveen said.

Ahmed handed over £20,000 after she demanded her cash back in 2006, but she has yet to receive any further return.

Ms Parveen added: 'He manipulated me into taking out loans which I am still paying off.'

Ahmed, of Bayswater, west London, denied seven counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three counts of procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception, and seven counts of obtaining property by deception.

The scams took place between October 2003 and June 2006.
