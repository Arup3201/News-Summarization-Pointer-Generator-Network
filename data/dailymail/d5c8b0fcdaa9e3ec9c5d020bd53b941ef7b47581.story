Russian president Vladimir Putin has called comments made by Prince Charles comparing him to Adolf Hitler 'unacceptable' and 'wrong', adding remarks of this kind are 'not what monarchs do'.

Mr Putin's response came just days after the Prince was reported to have made the remark in a private conversation with a Jewish refugee during an official visit to Canada.

His comments have met with a furious response from the Kremlin, with Putin's spokesman accusing the Prince of 'historical ignorance', while state-funded television channel Russia Today broadcast a programme highlighting the Royal Family's links to the Nazis.

During an interview with the world's leading news agencies in St Petersburg today, Mr Putin said Prince Charles' remarks remind him of the proverb: 'You are angry. That means you are wrong'.

In a direct personal message to the 
Prince, he added: 'Give my words to Prince Charles. He has been to our 
country more than once. If he made such a comparison it is unacceptable
 and I am sure he understands that as a man of manners.'

Prince Charles's remark has sparked particular anger in Russia because of the country's pride in its contribution to the defeat of Nazism in the Second World War.

An estimated 26 million Soviet citizens died in the conflict, including almost eight million members of the military.

Mr Putin did not refer directly to 
Russia's wartime sacrifices in his response to the Prince's remark, but 
he pointedly mentioned them earlier when discussing the upcoming 70th 
anniversary commemorations of the D-Day landings in Normandy.

 men are due to attend the event.

The guns 
may have long grown silent but there is still likely to be an 
embarrassing tension in the air on June 6, even if the Prince and the 
president do not shake hands.

They
 will be joined by a host of world leaders from the US president Barrack
 Obama and the Queen, to France's president Francois Hollande, who will 
be hosting the event attended by 2,000 Allied veterans.

'During the Second World War, we were allies and we were fighting together against Nazism,' said Mr Putin.

'As
 you know very well, the peoples of the Soviet Union and the people of 
Russia sacrificed a lot to win the war and achieve our joint victory 
over Nazism.'

'That
 is why it is quite natural that we are going to have a meeting in 
Normandy and we are going to pay tribute to our coalition partners, to 
the British, the Americans and the French.'

Mr Putin's 90-minute televised interview
 at his official residence of Constantine Palace at Strelna came at the 
end of an international economic forum in nearby St Petersburg.

At the event he struck a conciliatory note on Ukraine, indicating that he will 
recognise the victor of tomorrow's presidential election in the former 
Soviet state.

Royal Nazis: A feature on Russia Today's In the Now programme, saw senior political correspondent Anissa Naouai telling viewers: 'If anyone knows real Nazis, it's the Royal Family'

The presenter showed a picture of the Duke of Windsor - Charles's great uncle - visiting Hitler shortly after abdicating as Edward VIII. She added that his wife Wallace Simpson also 'hung out' with the Nazi leader

Today, he repeated that promise, telling
 senior executives and correspondents from 12 news agencies: 'We will 
treat any choice of the Ukrainian people with due respect.'

He added: 'We are going to treat the choice of the Ukrainian people with due respect and we are going to work with the authorities that are going to be shaped based on the elections.'

However, he made clear that he continues to regard former president Viktor Yanukovych, ousted in February after months of protests, as Ukraine's legitimate leader.

Ukraine's constitution allowed presidents to be removed on grounds of incapacity, impeachment or resignation, he said, adding: 'Look at the Ukrainian constitution. Read the words. We are adults. We can read.'

Mr Putin said that he would have preferred to see a referendum staged on a new constitution before any presidential election, as envisaged in an agreement between the regime and opposition shortly before Yanukovych's removal in what he termed an 'anti-constitutional coup d'etat'.

Asked whether the Ukraine crisis was pushing the world towards a new Cold War, Mr Putin said: 'I wouldn't like to think that it is the beginning of a new Cold War, because no-one is interested in that and I think it will not happen.'
