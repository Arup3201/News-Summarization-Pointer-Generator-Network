Lorraine White has been given permission to run her 'photography and mild fetish play business'

A dominatrix who calls herself Princess Lucina has won planning permission to turn a warehouse into a sex fetish dungeon - because it'll help the local economy.

Stockport Council has given Lorraine White the go-ahead to run her 'photography and mild fetish play' business in a converted warehouse at the Vauxhall Industrial Estate in Reddish.

She was already using the premises without planning permission but was forced to submit a retrospective application in September after a complaint was made to the local authority. 

Planning officers have now approved the application, which asked for opening hours of 11am to 7pm, Tuesday to Saturday.

A council spokesman said: 'The proposal would improve the economic, social and environmental conditions of the area.

'It therefore comprises sustainable development and the local planning authority [Stockport Council] worked proactively and positively to issue the decision without delay.'

The fetish club was discovered in 2012 when firemen were unable to get into the building after it caught fire because of all the locked doors. 

Miss White, who refers to herself as a 'Manchester mistress' and 'sensual sadist, was fined £8,000 for breaching health and safety laws at the time.

Firemen finally gained access and found a trove of handcuffs, chains and other restraining devices in the basement. 

They also discovered several canisters of nitrous oxide and laughing gas - also know as 'hippie crack' - which White’s clients used.

At the hearing at Stockport Magistrates Court Miss White said men were generally restrained or gagged in the dungeon, but nothing was too severe. 

At the time she said: 'It involved a lot of humiliation, doing domestic work and dressing up in women’s clothes.' 

Despite that the reaction to the club has been largely positive and the council received five responses to its consultation - all in favour.

White has previously been fined for breaching health and safety laws after firefighters were unable to get in 

Nearby resident Jason Morris, 44, said: 'I personally don't care as long as everyone is consenting.'

While many of the online responses have been positive or tongue in cheek. One said: 'What's the problem? It's all legit and she pays her taxes just like anyone else.'

Another said: 'I see she asked for permission. A true dominatrix would have demanded it.'
