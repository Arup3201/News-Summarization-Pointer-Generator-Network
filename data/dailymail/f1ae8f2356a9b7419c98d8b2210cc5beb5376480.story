As far as close-shaves go, this one must be a shoe-in for some sort of award.

A 77-year-old Czech pensioner has been filmed being hit by a speeding train, which sends his trainer flying off his foot.

Amazingly, the man himself escapes with only minor injuries, but will be feeling like a complete heel after being slapped with a fine by Czech police.

A pensioner in the Czech republic has been filmed on camera being hit by a train. The impact is enough to send his shoe flying off (pictured) but he escapes with only minor injuries

The footage starts as the lights begin flashing on the level crossing and the barriers start to come down

While several cars stop and wait, the man has no such thought, and instead walks around them

The close-shave happened in the small town of Rájec-Jestřebí as the express train to the nearby city of Brno passed through.

As the CCTV footage starts, the man - whose face has been hidden - can be seen walking towards the level crossing as the lights start flashing.

When the barriers come down, he calmly walks around them, and then waits as if checking both ways before deciding to risk walking across.

Only too late he realises how fast the train is approaching, but instead of turning back he tries to run the final few feet, and his left foot is hit.

After hesitating for a few moments, the man begins walking across, oblivious to the train hurtling at him

At the last moment he runs for it, and nearly makes it, but the train hits his left foot, tearing his shoe off

The force of the impact rips the shoes clean off his foot, sending it flying across the road, and leaving him flat out on his back.

Luckily he falls away from the tracks and on to his back, where he lays stunned until the train has finished passing. The elderly man then gets to his feet and starts to hobble away.

The whole incident is watched by waiting car drivers, but instead of stopping to help, they simply drive away as soon as the barriers have raised.

Laying on his back, the elderly man edges himself to safety as the express train to Brno continues going past

After the train has passed, the man simply gets up and hobbles away although he was fined by police

According to Zrcaldo, police spokeswoman Iva Blanenská Šebková said: 'The man was very lucky, he suffered a leg injury, but there is no danger to life.

'The whole thing shows quite a negative image of our country. The drivers show no respect, nor are they willing to help.'
