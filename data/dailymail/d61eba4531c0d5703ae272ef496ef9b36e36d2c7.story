A bus station which was dubbed the 'mouth of hell' by Grand Designs presenter Kevin McCloud will be demolished tomorrow. 

Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, East Midlands, opened nearly 40 years ago but after a new terminal was opened in the town last year the 'infamously ugly' building has lain redundant.

It faced criticism soon after it opened in 1976 after mineral stalactites began forming inside and in 2005 it was voted third in a list of 12 buildings that should be demolished for a Channel 4 series.

The programme, titled Demolition, was fronted by broadcaster McCloud when he compared the building to the 'mouth of hell'. It was described in the Lonely Planet guide as 'infamously ugly'.

There were also concerns for the safety of the bus station after two people died when they were hit by buses inside the station in the 2000s.

The three-storey building, which includes a car park and offices which have not been used for years, will be reduced to rubble tomorrow by demolition specialist DSM, which will 'blow it down'. 

David Macintosh, leader of Northampton Borough Council, said: 'It's funny because in the last couple of months, people have said "We will miss it."

'It's not very well-liked, and is now redundant. "The mouth of hell' sums it up perfectly." 

Alan Carr, who spent some of his childhood in Northampton, wrote on Twitter: 'Is that smelly cafe still there in the basement in Greyfriars bus station? You'd see people dry heaving before they got on their buses.' 

The four-acre site takes up a large part of the town centre, and the council has set up an exclusion zone - and is evacuating 414 nearby homes as a precaution.

Northampton Borough Council is live-streaming the demolition of the building, and urged spectators to watch it online rather than in person. 

The council said the structure is costing taxpayers £500,000 in repairs every year, and it would take almost £30 million to renovate. 

Its demolition is part of Northampton's regeneration programme and plans for new retail and leisure schemes are being considered. 

The town's new bus station has also had its problems with police being called in to direct traffic after queues of buses formed.
