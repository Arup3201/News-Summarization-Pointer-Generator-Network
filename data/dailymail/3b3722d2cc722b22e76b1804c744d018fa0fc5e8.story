The mistress of the philandering French President has denied claims that she is four months pregnant.

Actress Julie Gayet, 41, was said to be expecting Francois Hollande’s baby in June, according to unconfirmed reports by a French blogger who claimed the source was a journalist at the respected M6 television news channel.

Mr Hollande, 59, has been sneaking off on his scooter for nights of passion with Miss Gayet in an apartment 150 yards from the Elysee Palace, where he lives with partner Valerie Trierweiler.

Pregnant? Actress Julie Gayet, 41, is said to have spent several nights with French President Francois Hollande

Rumours: A Twitter post apparently by the Le Reel website claims Julie Gayet is four months pregnant

A translation of the post reads: 'Julie Gayet is four months pregnant according to a source close of Francois Hollande at L'elysee, information confirmed by a journalist at M6.'

Miss Gayet has since denied being pregnant - but not before the claim spread across the Internet following a 
post on Twitter from a French blogger called Le Reel.

And
 it quickly began to gain momentum, with former Tory MP Louise Mensch writing: 
‘French blogger tweeting source says Gayet 4 months pregnant; Valerie 
evidently not First Lady any more.’

A spokesman for M6 denied ‘any knowledge’ of the rumour. An Elysee Palace spokesman said he had ‘no comment’ on ‘such a matter’.

Miss Trierweiler, 48, has been in hospital since Friday suffering from ‘extreme shock’ over the affair revelations.

But
 in a press conference yesterday, Mr Hollande made no mention of his 
partner of seven years, refusing to say whether she was still First Lady
 and furiously denouncing questions about his ‘painful’ love life.

Addressing the nation, he proclaimed himself ‘totally indignant’ that his affair had been exposed.

'Distraught' Miss Trierweiler, 48, was admitted for treatment following the publication of photographs of the French leader sneaking in and out of his love-nest on the back of a moped

Waving
 his hands in frustration, he said it was a private matter which of the 
women was now his partner at the Elysee Palace – a role that is 
estimated to cost French taxpayers £70,000 a month.

He contemptuously indicated he would make up his mind before a state visit to Washington just before Valentine’s Day.

At
 a scheduled twice-yearly press conference, the first question was: 
‘Valerie Trierweiler, is she still today the First Lady of France?’

Mr
 Hollande pointedly refused to back his long-term love, saying only: 
‘Each and every one of us, in their personal lives, can go through 
difficult periods. And that’s our case. They are painful moments.

‘But
 I have one principle, which is that private matters are dealt with 
privately, within a respectful intimacy. So therefore it is neither the 
time or the place to do so.’

He
 added he would answer ‘any questions on this particular subject’ ahead 
of his state visit to Barack and Michelle Obama on February 11.

French President Francois Hollande has refused to answer whether his long-term girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler is still France's First Lady

As he faced the world's media for the first time since the news broke, the 59-year-old remained tight-lipped during questioning from journalists

Intriguingly, an Elysee Palace spokesman would not say to today whether Mr Hollande had even visited his de fact first lady in hospital, where Ms Trierweiler has so far spent four nights

The Prime Minster made it clear at Elysee Palace press conference in Paris that he had not made up his mind who he wanted to be with.

He said: 'Everyone of us can go through difficult
 periods in our personal life  and that is our case. They are painful 
moments, but I have one principle and that is that private matters are 
dealt with privately within a respectful intimacy. Therefore it is 
nether the time nor the place to do so.'

Asked if he would tighten France's already very strict privacy laws, Mr Hollande said: 'No, I am against changing laws for personal convenience.

'But my outrage is total. We are a country of great freedoms in France, but we do have a respect for private life and for human dignity.'

In words which may be considered extremely cruel by both women, Mr Hollande even confirmed that the presidential partner had 'no official status' in France, and he was determined to keep costs down, whoever was confirmed as first lady.

When questioned if his security had ever been compromised as suggested by some reports about his affair, Mr Hollande answered: 'When I travel officially and when I travel on a private basis, I have protection that is less suffocating. But I am protected everywhere.'

When
 later in the two-hour press conference he was asked again who the 
French First Lady was, he lost his cool, telling 600 assembled 
journalists from around the world he deplored last week’s expose of his 
infidelity in French Closer magazine.

‘My
 outrage is total. I am totally indignant, and it is not only personally
 that I’m indignant – it is a violation that affects a fundamental 
freedom, and could involve all of you,’ he said, pointing.

‘We are a country of great freedoms in France, but we do have a respect for private life and for human dignity.’

French
 journalists failed to grill him on why he had chosen to have his trysts
 in an apartment which has links to the Corsican mafia.

And
 he was let off lightly about the fact that Miss Trierweiler, as First 
Lady, has five members of staff, her own chauffeur and the use of 
private jets and limousines.

In
 words which may be considered extremely cruel by some, unmarried Mr 
Hollande claimed the presidential partner had ‘no official status’ in 
France, and said he was determined to keep costs down, whoever was 
confirmed as First Lady. The role was just a ‘habit’, he suggested.

But he did acknowledge that  Miss Trierweiler was on the public payroll and said: ‘For me, what is essential is transparency.’

Despite
 Mr Hollande’s protestations of an ‘invasion’ of privacy, Miss 
Trierweiler has been supplying daily briefings on her condition in 
hospital to French newspaper Le Parisien.

She told the paper she was ready to forgive her partner, if only he would make his intentions clear quickly.

Yesterday
 the newspaper claimed Mr Hollande wanted to announce his separation 
from Miss Trierweiler – for whom he left the mother of his four children
 – but is scared to do so while she is in hospital.

Today in answer to a question from a journalist about the Closer magazine photos Mr Hollande said he is outraged by the violation of his privacy, but says he will not sue

Mr Hollande added that 'my indignation is total' and the report is a 'violation that touches a personal liberty'

‘Some
 have advised him to make an announcement of a split, but the 
hospitalisation of Valerie Trierweiler convinced him to give it time,’ 
one friend told the publication.

An Elysee Palace spokesman would not say whether Mr Hollande had visited Miss Trierweiler in hospital.

There
 is nothing physically wrong with her, but she said Mr Hollande’s 
confession of cheating was like ‘being hit by a high-speed train’, and 
she is desperate to win public sympathy.

Bizarrely, though, it is Mr Hollande whose public ratings have risen as a result of the scandal – among women at least.

An
 opinion poll for Le Nouvel Observateur magazine showed his approval 
among women had jumped from 23 per cent in December to 26 per cent now.

It has been claimed the pair met at a £2.5million Paris love nest, registered to writer and actor Michel Ferracci

Meanwhile,
 despite being highly recognisable as one of France’s  most famous film 
stars, divorced Miss Gayet has gone into hiding. The actress, who has 
starred in several erotic movies in the past, has two teenage sons.

Her
 ex-husband, Argentine screenwriter Santiago Amigorena, 51, yesterday 
described her as ‘very calm and confident’ as she hid away from the 
media storm.

He said 
she was a ‘sublime actress, who works a lot, a mother who cares for her 
children,’ insisting there was ‘no fault, no deception’ on her part.

She has indicated that she is prepared to forgive President Francois Hollande for his affair with an actress, even though she felt she had been 'hit by a high speed train' when first told about it. But Elysee Palace sources in turn said Ms Trierweiler solely wanted to hold on to a position which ensured her wealth, fame and huge public influence

Since
 early last year, Mr Hollande has been making visits to his love nest on
 the back of a moped, using a crash helmet as a disguise.

An
 armed bodyguard working for one of France’s elite police units was 
tasked with bringing morning croissants to the lovers following their 
trysts.

But Sébastien 
Valiela, the photographer who caught Mr Hollande sneaking in and out of 
the apartment, claimed yesterday the President’s 63-man security team 
would leave him alone overnight.
