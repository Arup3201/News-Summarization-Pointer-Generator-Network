A teenager downed a potentially lethal cocktail of wine and gin before diving into a freezing harbour in the latest example of a horrific drinking game.

Sean Bisset, 18, was challenged by a friend to take part in the drinking craze ‘Neknominate' - which involves consuming an entire alcoholic drink in one go while simultaneously taking part in a physical act, then nominating someone else to do the same.

A video of the incident posted online showed the student, from Dunbar in Scotland, consuming the alcohol in one go before diving into freezing waters at the town’s harbour on Sunday afternoon.

Mr Bisset was branded a ‘lunatic’ by 
councillors in Dunbar, with one, Paul McLennan, describing his actions 
as 'incredibly stupid'.

Meanwhile, in a separate incident in Scotland, a horrified mother went public with a shocking picture of her unconscious son in an attempt to 
end the Neknominate craze.

Nikki Hunter found her 19-year-old son Keiren passed out on the sofa after drinking three bottles of spirits as part of the internet dare.

The 40-year-old at first feared he might be dead or dying and placed the teenager in the recovery position to assist his breathing.

Terrified that her son could easily have killed himself, Mrs Hunter, 40, posted the picture online and asked everyone to share it.

She wrote: 'I don’t want another parent to walk into this scene or, God forbid, something worse.'

Keiren had accepted a dare to film himself downing a deadly mixture of vodka, whisky, rum, sherry and Irn-Bru.

Hours after his mother posted the picture of him comatose and covered in vomit, the pictures had been shared 15,000 times.

Speaking from the family home in Prestonpans, East Lothian, Mrs Hunter said: ‘I wanted other parents to know what their kids are doing... I walked through the door and thought, oh my God, it was horrendous – he could have died.'

'I gave him a talking-to when he woke up this morning, and told him I’d put the picture on Facebook to embarrass him so he wouldn’t do it again,' she added.

Mrs Hunter added: 'Other parents and kids need to know how dangerous this is and what the actual effects are.'

In the message she posted on Facebook, Mrs Hunter wrote: 'Keiren, you drank nearly three bottles of spirits – you could have killed yourself, especially when your body’s not used to it.'

'That’s why you’re getting abuse and paying for a professional cleaner to clean my settee.'

In response the 19-year-old said: 'When I woke up this morning I got a good telling-off and sent back to bed. I had a major hangover and a load of abuse on Facebook.

'I drank the drink three times because the first two attempts didn’t film so I drank way more than I should have... I was really stupid, if I’d have known people had died from doing it then I wouldn’t have done it.’ 

Dr Evelyn Gillan, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said: ‘This young man could have choked on his own vomit... This reinforces the urgent need to stop this dangerous craze.'

‘Nominating friends to down large quantities of alcohol leads to dangerous situations as can be seen in this photograph. 

‘The viral craze of Neknominate sweeping social media is of serious concern and is costing young people their lives.’

Jonny Byrne, 19, from and Ross Cummings, 22, both from Ireland, have died after taking part in the drinking craze.
