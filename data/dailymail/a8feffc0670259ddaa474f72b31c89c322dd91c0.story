A woman has opened up about her shock when a picture of her went viral for the wrong reasons - and how she won back her dignity.

Ohio native Caitlin Seida, 24, wrote on Salon.com that she was initially 'kind of amused' when a friend informed her that her picture had been used on a website that mocked people's appearances.

But once she began scrolling through the hateful comments that referred to her as a 'heifer' and suggested she should 'just kill herself', Ms Seida says she felt like 'the world imploded - and took my heart with it.'

Caught off-guard: Caitlin Seida, 24, was shocked after reading the comments on this photo of her that went viral on a site mocking people's appearances, writing: 'The world imploded - and took my heart with it'

In the photo, which was taken on Halloween, Ms Seida is dressed up as her favorite video game heroin Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. But the caption on the website read 'Fridge Raider' instead.

'That picture was taken late in the evening,' she explains. 'I was red-faced from the heat, my makeup was sweating off and I was lacking proper boob support.'

While to her, the photo showed how much fun she was having at the time, commenters - most of them women - took a different view, cruelly remarking on her appearance.

Some of the critics wrote that she was a 'waste of space,' while others suggested she should die to 'spare everyone's eyes.'

Despite her sadness and shock at the comments, Ms Seida admits she understood why these internet users sunk so low.

'No one thought about the possibility that I might read those words. Far less that I would talk'

'Of course, they hadn't really thought
of me as a person. Why should they? These images are throwaways, little
bursts of amusement to get through a long workday.

'No one thought about the possibility that I might read those words,' she writes. 'Far less, that I would talk.'

And
talk she did. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, Ms Seida decided to 
take action by retaliating against her hateful critics, and taking back 
her dignity.

Her own terms: Ms Seida said the new photo shoot helped her see herself as she wanted to be seen

She started by 
finding out who had written the comments and sent them messages that 
read: 'You're being an a******. 'Why don't you just do the right thing 
and delete the post and stop sharing it?'

'I got a number of them taken down, but once something like this spreads it's out there forever'

Next,
she used her training as a paralegal to send out hundreds of copyright 
violation notices to each of the websites that had hosted her image.

'I
got a fair number of them taken down, but once something like this 
spreads, it's out there forever,' she writes, adding that she still gets
concerned friends asking her if she knows her image is being used on 
the internet.

Teaching them a lesson: Using her training as a paralegal, she found out who the commenters were and issued copyright violation notices to the websites

Since the incident, she has taken to sticking up for people on similar websites, and she's also learned to keep a close watch on her privacy settings online.

She also enlisted a photographer friend to do a retro pinup photo shoot with her, which helped her regain self-confidence and see herself as she really wanted to be seen.

But her 
biggest and most satisfying form of retaliation is in continuing to share 
the photo, on her own terms. 'To own it again, without shame this time,' 
she explains.
