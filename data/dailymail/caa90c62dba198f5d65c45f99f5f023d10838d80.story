Sick: Jimmy Savile made the shocking claims in his 1974 Barrie & Jenkins book As It Happens

Jimmy Savile once spent the night in a tent on a hillside with six girls wearing matching mini-skirts and white boots as ‘payment’ for taking part in a charity event, he wrote in an out-of-print memoir.

The shamed TV star and the girls ‘fell about and over each other, making enough noise to wake the dead’ at a location in Yorkshire, he said in his 1974 Barrie & Jenkins book As It Happens.

Savile, who died last year in Leeds aged 84, also recalled being recognised on a beach by a girl, who began to take off her swimsuit inside her caravan for him, leaving him ‘wringing wet with heat and temptation’, until her parents entered.

He claimed a council chairman called him as he wanted the annual mayoral ball to become a youth dance, because the event had previously only attracted a few hundred locals in the past.

The presenter told the chairman: ‘I will come if you will arrange for me to sleep in a tent up the local hillside with another tent alongside with six girls to sleep there as my bodyguards.

He added: ‘My demands really put the dance on the map and 2,000 tickets went like hot cakes.

'My ultimatum of “no tents, no girls, no me” meant the council had to go through with it.’

A newspaper advert was placed for young girls to spend the night with him, and he claimed that hundreds applied, reported the Sunday Mirror.

Savile even said the unknown council called a 
meeting to decide which six girls to use, and half of the 
members left in disbelief at the discussion.

Jimmy Savile was today astonishingly linked to the Yorkshire Ripper's killings, after it was revealed the third victim Irene Richardson was murdered yards from his home in Leeds.

Savile was a regular visitor to Broadmoor psychiatric hospital and befriended Peter Sutcliffe, now 66, after he was moved there.

Britain’s top expert on serial killers said police should probe whether the pair developed a friendship before Sutcliffe was caught – and the family of the Ripper's first victim have joined calls for officers to question Savile.

Former prison officer Professor David Wilson of Birmingham City University told the Sun: ‘At first sight the suggestion that Savile might be connected with the crimes committed by Sutcliffe will seem farfetched.

‘Yet predatory paedophiles and serial killers are the awful products of common forces which, in their case, were allowed to develop unchecked.'

Richard McCann, 42, son of the Ripper’s first victim Wilma McCann, added that if an expert has called for a probe into Sutcliffe’s relationship with Savile, then it should happen.

Savile described the girls as ‘good enough to eat’ and he had an ‘incredible evening’. But the father of one girl realised what was happening before the event started and dragged his daughter home.

Later on that evening Savile claimed the ‘girls’ tent fell over and we all had to finish up together’.

He also wrote in the book about being recognised on a beach by a girl, who invited into him into her family’s caravan while his two minders stayed with her parents, reported the Sunday Mirror.

Savile said the girl began to undress. He wrote: ‘I have sunk into a chair, wringing wet with the heat and temptation. A rustling and snapping from the dark end tells me that the swimsuit is off.'

He said her parents suddenly entered the caravan - but the situation was ‘saved’ as the girl quickly slid into a dress and pretended to make tea.

Meanwhile, Savile was said to be so close to Prince Charles that he advised him on the appointment of Sir Christopher Airy as his private secretary in 1990, it was claimed today by the Sunday Times.

Savile and Charles met former major-general Airy before he was offered the post, portraying an extraordinary close friendship between the heir to the throne and the disgraced TV star.

'Savile was in and out of the palace at that time pretty frequently,' a source said. 'His bling and his tracksuits made him rather unconventional and I think that was appealing to Prince Charles.’

Ex-royal press secretary Dickie Arbiter said Savile was a ‘brought in by an aide as a sort of “Jim’ll Fix It” to fix the state of the marriage’ of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, ‘but of course it didn’t work’.

St James’s Palace said it had no record of Savile being at Airy’s interview. Airy refused to comment.

Plastic bag: Savile was said to have left toys meant for sick children for years at his flat in the grounds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire. Proof of the hoard was captured in a picture taken in 1999

Savile's reputation was hit again after claims he hoarded toys left by the public in memory of Princess Diana - which were meant for sick children - in his hospital flat in green bin bags.

The toys had been placed among thousands of floral tributes outside the gates of Kensington Palace in west London. Royal aides decided the toys should be given to sick children in Diana’s memory.

But Savile was said to have left them for years at his flat in the grounds of Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

Instead of passing them around, the toys languished in his flat for at least two years. Proof of the hoard was captured in a picture taken in 1999, two years after Diana’s death.

A Stoke Mandeville Hospital source said: ‘I am sure that the public will be shocked to hear that Savile could not be bothered to give the donated toys to the sick child patients.’

The Savile scandal first arose when ITV broadcast new sex abuse allegations in a documentary about the late presenter on October 3, which sparked a mammoth police inquiry.

Intense scrutiny over the BBC followed, after the Corporation dropped a Newsnight report into the presenter’s actions last year after his death.

Savile is believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims. Scotland Yard is leading a probe into his activities, with detectives following 400 lines of inquiry.

Comedian Freddie Starr and former pop star Gary Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, have both been questioned by officers investigating the abuse scandal.

A number of alleged victims claim they were abused by Savile while pupils at Duncroft Approved School in Surrey during the 1970s.

Savile's estate, reportedly worth £4.3million, has been frozen in response to the allegations.

NatWest Bank, which is acting as his executor and trustee, said the distribution of his assets had been put on hold in anticipation of legal action from his alleged victims.

Institution: University of Leeds chiefs awarded the honorary doctorate of law to Savile in 1986

A university which awarded Jimmy Savile an honorary doctorate of law in the 1980s could become the latest institution to distance itself from the disgraced DJ.

Chiefs at the University of Leeds proudly awarded the accolade to the Leeds-born TV presenter and charity fundraiser in 1986. 

But in view of more than a month of shocking allegations which have left the former star's reputation in tatters, the award is due to be discussed by a university committee.

A university spokesman said: ‘At the time of (Savile's) nomination and when the award was conferred, no concerns had been raised with the university about his behaviour and we were not aware of any allegations against him. 

‘In the light of this new information, the matter will be discussed when the honorary degree committee next meets (later this month).’
