The 300-million-year-old remains of two prehistoric amphibians that have been preserved as one choked on the other are to be sold at auction for £150,000.

The fossilised creatures, that resemble modern crocodiles, were discovered in Rhineland-Palatinate, near Frankfurt in Germany, and are thought to be extremely rare.

The ancient skeletons are in such good condition they show that the larger, 2ft creature died of suffocation just after it bit the smaller one in half.

The fossils of the two amphibians in their final moments were discovered in Rhineland-Palatinate, near Frankfurt in Germany, and are thought to be extremely rare

Even minute details such as skin impressions and the sharp teeth of the killer animal have been perfectly preserved.

Sclerocephalus haeuseri lived around 300 million years ago, between the Upper Carboniferous and the Lower Permian periods.

The creature looked like a cross between a crocodile and a salamander.

Adults could reach a length of up to five feet.

Experts believe the creature's young were similar to modern frogs - breathing with external gills when young like tadpoles but eventually developing air breathing lungs.

Experts are delighted with the discovery because is it one of few fossil examples of this species, Sclerocephalus haeuseri.

The animal looked similar to a crocodile and a salamander today and are thought to be aquatic creatures.

Historians and scientists also believe this is thought to be the first fossil discovered that shows a creature of this species dying of suffocation.

James Walker, 64, director of nature and science at Heritage Auctions in Texas, where the auction ill be held, said: 'The fossil was found in the Saar-Ruhe Basin in the Rheinland-Pfalz area of what used to be West Germany.

'The fossil dates back to somewhere around the boundary between the Upper Carboniferous and the Lower Permian, between 301 and 297 million years old.

'This was the lower boundary of the Permian and it was a time of great transition in climates and ecology.

'The larger one bit off more than it could swallow, in this case, and it was killed by choking on dinner. The smaller one died because it was bitten in half.

'The larger one is a Sclerocephalus haeuseri and the smaller is most likely to be of the same species. They were similar to the crocodiles and alligators of today.

'It is rare to find fossils to begin with, and well-preserved ones are even rarer.

'Examples where both died as a consequence of what could be termed stupid behaviour are quite rare.

'The 'stupid' individuals remove themselves from the gene-pool, and therefore tend to not pass one their 'stupid' genes or behavior.

'Only that the owners are private collectors of long standing with an eye for the rare and unusual.'

The auction will be held on Oct 19th and 20th.
