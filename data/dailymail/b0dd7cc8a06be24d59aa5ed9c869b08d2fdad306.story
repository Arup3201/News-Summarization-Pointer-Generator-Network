Brittany Killgore, 22, was tortured and murdered for refusing to participate in bondage sex games

Prosecutors in California won't seek the death penalty for the three people facing trial for the brutal slaying of a Marine wife two years ago. 

The suspects in the rape, torture and murder of 22-year-old Brittany Killgore will instead face life in prison if they're convicted on first-degree murder charges, U-T San Diego reported. The San Diego District Attorney's Office didn't reveal why it wouldn't try to put them to death.

The trio — Louis Perez, 48, Dorothy Maraglino, 39 and Jessica Lopez, 27 — are expected to face trial on June 1 over the 2012 disappearance of Killgore, whose Marine husband was in Afghanistan at the time of the slaying. They are also charged with conspiracy, kidnapping and torture.

Prosecutors charge Killgore, met the trio when she and a friend went to a home in Fallbrook, north of San Diego, to buy an item being sold online.

Killgore, whose husband was a Camp Pendleton Marine, turned down Perez's offer.

But later in the day, sent him a text message asking if she knew anyone who could help her move.

Prosecutors say 48-year-old Louis Perez, a former Camp Pendleton Marine sergeant, was the 'sex master' in the trio whose 'unusual sexual fetishes' led them to kidnap, rape and murder Killgore in 2012

'Party with me tonight & you’ll have five guys there in the morning,' replied Perez, a Camp Pendleton Marine sergeant.

It is unclear if Killgore took him up on the offer, but prosecutors Perez and his accomplices kidnapped Killgore and made her an unwilling participant in bondage and torture.

She was then strangled and her nude body left in a ditch near Lake Skinner in Riverside County.

Witness testimony later revealed that Perez, Maraglino and Lopez  lived together in the house where Killgore was killed, where they participated in an alternative lifestyle that included bondage and sadomasochism.

A detective said the trio may have targeted Killgore for 'unusual sexual fetishes.'

Police seized from the house whips, sex toys, rope and pulleys, a document titled 'Slave Rules,' duct tape, a stun baton and other bondage instruments from the house. 

Killgore's last communication was a desperate text message to a friend the night of her murder: 'Help'

Investigators found Killgore's blood and hair on several of the items

Investigators said they believe all three were with Killgore at the home shortly after she apparently sent a desperate text message to a friend that simply said: 'Help.'

Perez was arrested in April 2012 on suspicion of possessing a stolen assault rifle and was later charged with murder.

That same month, Lopez was arrested at a San Diego hotel where she was discovered with self-inflicted cuts.

They also found a letter in which Lopez allegedly claimed that she killed Killgore out of fear that the woman would steal away Perez, whom she described as her 'master.'

Lopez said she tried to chop up Killgore's body with power tools before dumping it near the lake, but the body was found hours later.

The letter also contended that Perez and Maraglino weren't responsible for the killing. However, prosecutors said both were involved.

Killgore was last seen April 13, 2012, in a borrowed purple evening gown, three days after she filed for divorce from Lance Cpl Cory Killgore.

Cory Killgore, who returned from Afghanistan after hearing of his wife's disappearance, was cleared of any involvement in her death.
