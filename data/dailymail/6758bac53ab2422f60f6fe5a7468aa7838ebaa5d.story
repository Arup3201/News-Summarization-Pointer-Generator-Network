It is one of the most important weeks of the political calendar - a time when the Prime Minister must convince his party that he is taking Britain in the right direction.

But David Cameron hardly seemed raring to go today as the Conservative party conference got under way.

Rubbing his eyes and stifling a yawn, the Tory leader looked as though he might fall asleep as Foreign Secretary William Hague addressed delegates in Birmingham.

Mr Cameron, who was sat next to Mr Hague's wife Ffion, is under pressure to reassure his grassroots activists without appearing to abandon the political centre ground.

He is to present himself as the heir to Margaret Thatcher, vowing he is ‘not for turning’ on the need to tackle Britain’s debt.

And the Prime Minister will go further, claiming to have done more to reform schools, pensions and the EU than the Iron Lady.

Making clear his determination to 
stick his economic plan, Mr Cameron said today: 'I want us to be the 
party that actually levels with the British public and talks very 
plainly and straightly about what needs to be done.

'The
 fact is we have to find those spending reductions, and if we want to 
avoid cuts in things like hospitals and school and the services that we 
all rely on, we have to look at things like the welfare budget, where 
we’re still spending, as a country, £80bn on working-age welfare.

'That’s not the pensions, not the disability benefits, but working age welfare,' he told BBC One's Marr Show.

But Mr Cameron risks a row with his 
Liberal Democrat coalition partners, after publicly ruling out their 
idea of a mansion tax as an attack on people who work hard to buy their 
own own.

The Lib Dems want an levy on all homes worth more than £2million.

But Mr Cameron today said: 'I don't 
actually believe we should be a country where if you work hard, you 
save, you buy yourself a house, you try and pay down the mortgage, you 
save and invest into that house - I don't want to be a country that 
comes after you every year with a massive great tax.

'So that is not going to happen. But we have put extra taxes where people buy expensive properties.

'We will always be fair and seen to be fair,' he told the BBC.

In
 a series of interviews today, the PM has admitted he must ‘raise his 
game’ in order to avoid a repeat of the bungling u-turns which have seen
 his personal ratings, and those of his party, nosedive.

An
 Opinium/Observer poll today put Labour on 41 per cent, up to points, 
with Tories on 30 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on nine.

But
 Mr Cameron will us the conference to insist he will not be diverted 
from his austerity plans, demanding billions of pounds of public 
spending cuts, in an echo of Mrs Thatcher’s famous ‘the lady’s not for 
turning’ promise at the Tory conference in 1980.

David Cameron and his ministers will use the Tory conference to unveil a raft of policies in an attempt to boost the party's opinion poll ratings. They include:

Ministers are buoyed by improving economic figures, but are anxious about being seen to publicly predict 'green shoots' of recovery.

George Osborne, the chancellor, said he thought the economy was 'healing'.

Today, Mr Cameron said he could not predict the next set of economic figures, but was confident that the economy was being rebalanced.

But others are more publicly optimistic. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond claimed that the public would see real economic improvement by 2014, provided the Euro remained stable.

'You won't find anybody, hardly anybody in the business community or in the financial community, who thinks that the economy is doing right now what the data tell us it is doing,' Mr Hammond told The Observer.

Both the Conservatives and Liberal 
Democrats have made clear that their election prospects in 2015 will 
depend on the state of the economy.

He admits he must do more to ‘explain’ what the government is doing.

‘You spend a lot of time governing and deciding, and you don’t spend enough time explaining.

‘And I think conference week is a real opportunity to get out there and explain.’

But he makes clear there will be no deviation from the need for tough decisions on the economy.

Mr Cameron said: ‘I think the British public are extremely fair minded.

‘I
 think they know that Britain faces difficult circumstances, they know 
the hole that we’re in is quite a deep one, they know it takes time to 
get out,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph.

‘Of course, there are things that 
we’ve done that they don’t like, of course there are things they wish we
 had done differently. That’s in the nature of things But, the public 
know this is difficult and tough, and it’s a five year parliament, and 
my sense is that they’ll judge us at the end of it rather than half way 
through it.

‘We’ve got a lot to prove and there’s no doubt that the mountain in front of us has got steeper and more difficult to climb.’

David Cameron used interviews today to insist he will not be diverted from his 'austerity' economic plan but promised help for homeowners and commuters

The sun shone on the first day of the Tory conference, as senior ministers struck a more upbeat tone on the state of the economy

The conference theme ‘Britain can deliver’ will focus on the economy and try to present a more upbeat vision of the future.

As
 delegates gather in Birmingham, the PM brushed aside claims he had 
failed to take tough decisions and boasted that he had been bolder than 
Mrs Thatcher.

'So have we dithered over educational reform? Mrs Thatcher never reformed public sector pensions. We have done that.

‘Mrs Thatcher never vetoed a European treaty. I have done that.

‘Capping welfare payments — no government has ever done that,’ he told The Sun.

'If we just wanted to be popular, we would not have targeted the deficit.'

Strategists
 hope that taking a tough line with Brussels will recreate the opinion 
poll boost enjoyed by the Conservatives after Mr Cameron vetoed a new 
treaty in December last year.

The
 PM today said he would block 'outrageous' attempts to increase the 
overall EU budget in looming talks on spending for 2014 to 2020.

'If it comes to saying 'no' to a deal that isn't right for Britain, I'll say 'no',' he told The Sunday Telegraph.

David Cameron claimed today that he had been bolder than Margaret Thatcher as he promised to block 'outrageous' EU demands for an even bigger budget

And he set out a 'bold thinking' idea which would split the EU budgets into one for the 17 eurozone nations and another for the 10 - including Britain - outside the single currency.

In one of the most eye-catching announcements, Mr Cameron said the government would cap rises in rail fares.

Train companies were going to be 
allowed to raise the average price of regulated fares - which include 
season tickets - by RPI inflation plus three per cent in January 2013 
and then again in January 2014.

But
 Mr Cameron said that the rise for the next two years will be limited to
 RPI plus one per cent, or 4.2 per cent instead of the planned 6.2 per 
cent.

Some commuters will be over £200 better off over the two years.

The PM insisted it was proof that he was not abandoning the political centre ground.

'Are the Conservatives deserting the common ground of British politics? Absolutely not.

David Cameron announced that from January, season tickets will rise by 4.2 per cent, and not the planned 6.2 per cent

'I think the common ground of British politics, right now, ought to be [doing] everything you can to fire up the engines of enterprise and aspiration to get the economy moving, while holding onto the things that people care about passionately, like the NHS. I think that is absolutely where we are.'

But Mr Cameron ruled out cuts to benefits for wealthy pensioners.

'Let me be absolutely clear, 
the promise that I made at the last election to Britain's pensioners 
when I said we are not going to take away your winter fuel allowance, 
your free TV licences, your free bus passes - that promise stands.'

The Prime Minister also defended the decision to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p - seized on by Labour as a 'tax cut for millionaires'.

'The richest 10 per cent in our country are not only paying more in income tax, they are paying a greater percentage of the total income tax take than they ever did under Labour,' Mr Cameron said.

But Labour's Michael Dugher renewed the attack on the Tories.

'David Cameron can't be a One Nation Prime Minister. He says one thing, but time and again does another,' Mr Dugher said.

'He says those at the top will need to pay more, but he is the man whose top priority is to cut taxes for millionaires, giving 8,000 people earning over £1 million a tax break of £40,000 this April.'
