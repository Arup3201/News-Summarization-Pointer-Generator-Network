Hundreds of Shutterfly customers were left bemused after the photo publishing service sent them e-mails congratulating them on being a 'new parent' - even though many were not expecting.

The message, which was intended for shoppers who had recently purchased birth announcements on the site, read: 'As a new 
parent you're going to find more to love, more to give and more to share - we're here to help you every step of the way.'

Recipients who weren't expecting took to Twitter to voice their hilarious reactions to the 'baby news', with one person writing: 'Shutterfly just sent me a "congratulations on your new arrival" email. They know something I don't??'

What to expect when you're not expecting: Hundreds of Shutterfly customers were left bemused after receiving e-mails congratulating them on being a 'new parent' - even though many were not expecting

Another person who got the e-mail tweeted: 'Shutterfly sends email congratulating me on new baby. I have no recollection of this event. I hope I didn't leave a baby at the hospital.'

And yet another joker wrote: 'Congrats to all of those impregnated by @Shutterfly this morning.'

Clearly embarrassed by the error, Shutterfly issued an apology shortly thereafter.

'Earlier this morning, we unintentionally sent an e-mail to some of our customers,' it read. 'We deeply apologize for this intrusion and any offense this may have caused.

'Our intention was to email customers who have recently purchased birth announcements with us, and it was sent to a larger distribution in error.'

Luckily it seems most customers found humor in the mistake, with only a few - including one who wrote: 'Guess they're trying to tell me my biological clock is ticking' - expressing their annoyance.

A similar mistake made by a fertility clinic on Sunday had somewhat more dire consequences.

Surprise! Recipients who do not have children took to Twitter to voice their hilarious reactions to the 'news'

Lighthearted: It seems most found humor in the mistake, with only a few expressing their annoyance

Shady Grove Fertility, which has locations in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., was forced to apologize after sending out a Mother's Day e-mail to a group of patients who were still trying to get pregnant.

Unsurprisingly, the women who received the message were none too happy to be reminded that they were not yet mothers.

One woman expressed her frustration on Facebook, writing that she was 'very upset' about the error.

'It was bad enough that it was Mother's Day,' she wrote. 'And then I recently had a D&C for a miscarriage on 4-26. Talk about kicking you while you're down.'

Reactions: Hundreds of customers were confused and entertained by the accidental e-mail

The clinic sent out an apology explaining that the e-mail was 'intended for patients who have already conceived and graduated from the practice,' and expressing deep regret for any offense caused.

'As you can understand, within this context, the message was very insensitive and hurtful to many,' read the letter.

'We want to personally extend our deepest apologies and assure you that we would never intentionally send a note like this to our patients struggling to conceive.'
