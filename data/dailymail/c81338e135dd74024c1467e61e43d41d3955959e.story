A 10-month-old girl in Louisiana is in a hospital after being trapped underneath her father's decomposing body for several days.

Sabine Parish Deputy Coroner Ron Rivers says that the infant, Betty Jean Fields, was dehydrated and had blistering skin, the Shreveport Times reported. 

'It was able to breath, expand its chest up and down,' Rivers say of the girl. 'We're very blessed that the baby didn't succumb.'

Betty had a seizure when she first arrived at LSU Medical Center in Shreveport, but she was already playing with stuffed animals later, KSLA reported. 

She was listed in good condition on Sunday is expected to make a full recovery.

The mother was in jail on misdemeanor charges at the time but was released on Saturday to care for the baby girl and her 5-year-old brother, who had alerted neighbors on Friday night.

Rivers said he found Jason Fields, 43,  dead on a bed alongside a laptop computer at the home in the small town of Pleasant Hill, south of Shreveport.

He appeared to be sitting on the side of his bed when he fell backward and died.

'The fact that he fell on her and made no attempt to get up tells me he died instantly when he fell on top of her,' Rivers told The Times. 

The house had no air conditioning and Rivers said the ambient temperature was more than 100 degrees when he entered.

Deputies were called to the Fields' home Friday after the girl's 5-year-old brother went next door to tell neighbors he thought his father was dead.

The boy didn't suffer any injuries — but it is still unclear how survived for three days, the Times reported. 

No autopsy will be performed on Fields, who had a history of cardiac problems, because of the condition of the body.
