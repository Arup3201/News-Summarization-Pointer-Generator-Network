The previously unknown story of a compassionate WWI nurse who cared for wounded Germans despite her own brother dying on the battlefields has emerged for the first time.

Little was known about nurse Margaret Maule until a battered suitcase containing her mementos was discovered at the back of a cupboard at the University of Abertay, in Dundee.

Researchers have been able to piece together bits and pieces of her life from photographs, her diary, letters, nursing certificates and an article she had written for a newspaper.

But academics at the university are at a loss to explain why the suitcase was hidden away in a cupboard at the university, especially since there is no record of her ever having been there.

Researchers are now trying to find the missing links to piece together the full story.

Inside the old case, there was an article Nurse Maule had written for a newspaper called The People's Journal and an autograph book filled with sketches and thank you notes from German patients.

According to the diary she had reservations about treating enemy soldiers as her brother had been killed in action in the spring 1917.

Yet despite her misgivings the kind-hearted nurse is known to have tended to injured German prisoners of war during her time at the Dartford War Hospital, in Kent, as well as British soldiers at a hospital in Glasgow.

Robin Ion, head of Abertay's Nursing and Counselling Division, is keen to hear from anyone who can shed more light on Nurse Maule.

He said: 'The contents of this suitcase are absolutely fascinating, but we know very little about the person who owned it. There's no record of her ever having been to Abertay, so how it came to be in our possession is a complete mystery.

'All we know about her is what we've been able to piece together from the things we found in her suitcase.

'It contains documents dating back to 1914, including her diary and an article she wrote for a newspaper called The People's Journal.

'There's also an autograph book filled with detailed sketches drawn for her by her patients by way of thanks for the care she gave them, and a number of faded photographs of her and her fellow nurses dressed in their pristine white uniforms.'

This is an important discovery as very little is known about nursing during World War I, at the time a relatively new profession, Mr Ion said.

'She was desperate to do her bit for the war effort. So it came as a shock when she learnt she was to be sent to Dartford to care for prisoners of war.

'The fact that she managed to carry out her duties in spite of her misgivings, and that she did so in such a way that her patients went to the trouble of crafting gifts for her to show their appreciation, indicates that she was one of the best,' he said.

'Nursing has always been about showing compassion without prejudice and Nurse Maule showed an enormous depth of feeling to her patients under very difficult circumstances.'

Nurse Maule was part of the Queen Alexandra's Imperial Nursing Service (QAIMNS) was formed in 1902, which replaced the Army Nursing Service, formed in the 1850s to provide care to soldiers injured during the Crimean War.

The nurse was born in Paisley in 1887, she went to East Public School and trained as a nurse at Merryflatts Hospital - now the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow - from 1914 to 1917.

After the war she worked in the Shakespeare Hospital in Glasgow, before doing further training at the Greenock District Nursing Association in 1919.

She was sent a letter of appreciation for her service from the Ministry of Defence when she finally retired after 52 years of service in 1969 aged 82.

The university is now appealing for anyone with information on the heroic nurse to come forward.

Mr Ion said: 'If anyone knew Nurse Maule, or has any information about where the suitcase might have come from, I'd be very keen to hear from them

'She's a fantastic example of what nursing is all about and it would be wonderful if any of her relations alive today could tell us more about her.'

If anyone has any information they would like to share with Abertay about Nurse Maule, please send an email to communications@abertay.ac.uk.
