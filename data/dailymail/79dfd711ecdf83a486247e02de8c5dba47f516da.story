Chef Neil Iron allegedly spiked a chocolate mousse with ecstasy which was later eaten by two toddlers, who were both hospitalised

Two toddlers were taken to hospital after eating a chocolate pudding spiked with Ecstasy by a chef who once served the Queen, a court was told.

Neil Iron, 32, is accused of lacing desserts with the party drug to ‘liven up’ a birthday celebration at a trendy gastropub.

The youngsters were taken ill after their parents took them to the Red Lion in Hoxton, East London, the following day for Sunday lunch.

One of the children suffered a ‘pretty severe’ allergic reaction after they shared a chocolate mousse pot, and both were left ‘injured and seriously affected’.

Another customer, Charlie Webster, had an ‘out-of-body experience’ after eating two chocolate truffles left over from the party.

Iron, a former head chef at the Royal Marsden hospital in Chelsea, once served the Queen and Prince Edward afternoon tea when they opened a rehabilitation centre for cancer patients. He also reached the semi-finals of the National Chef Of The Year awards.

Snaresbrook Crown Court was told he began working at the Red Lion, which is popular with families, last September. The three victims were allegedly poisoned after visiting on October 9. The jury was told the two children fell ill after eating a chocolate pot at the end of a roast lunch with their parents. After they were taken to hospital tests on them found traces of cocaine and Ecstasy.

Police were called, and they traced the youngsters’ movements back to the pub. Officers informed Iron the next day that the children had been taken ill, and he was arrested later that month.

Giving evidence in his defence, Iron claimed that the desserts could have been tampered with at the chaotic party on Saturday night.

The chef, who was cautioned last April for cocaine possession, said: ‘It must have been a person from the party because that’s where the food was. I wasn’t in the room, I was in the kitchen.’

He added that leftovers were brought 
to the kitchen by guests at about 1.45am when the party ended. ‘At that 
point, there were about six people milling around in the kitchen,’ he 
said. ‘Other people were putting food in the fridge as well as me.’

The court heard a chocolate cake made for the party was tested and did not have any traces of drugs.

Under cross-examination by prosecutor 
Jack Talbot, the chef denied telling the children’s father or Mr Webster
that there were drugs in the truffles.

‘I’m not going to say to someone, 
“would you like some drug-laced food products?” when you are about to 
sit in my restaurant and consume a lunch,’ he said.

Mr Talbot claimed that Iron was lying,
and that guests at the party may have asked him to lace the desserts 
with drugs to ‘liven it up’. He said: ‘You made it clear, even if it was
by alluding to it, that they were drug truffles. You told at least Mr 
Webster that there were drugs in there.’

Describing how Mr Webster came to eat 
the truffles, Iron said: ‘He came into the kitchen and asked where his 
dinner was. While he was in the kitchen I took out the tray of truffles 
and asked him if he wanted one. He took one, ate it and said “that’s 
nice”.

‘Two minutes later his dinner was on 
the table. He came in half-way through and asked if he could have 
another truffle. I said “help yourself”.’

Iron, from Hoxton, denies three counts of administering poison or a noxious substance with intent.

The jury will consider their verdicts today.
