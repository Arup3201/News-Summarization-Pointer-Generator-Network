Two of King John's teeth are due to go on display alongside surviving copies of the original Magna Carta at the British Library.

The molars were extracted as souvenirs from King John's tomb at Worcester Cathedral in 1979 by William Wood, a stationer's apprentice.

The teeth will now go on show alongside two of the original Magna Carta documents, as part of a new exhibition to celebrate parliamentary democracy.

King John signed the Magna Carta - which established the principle of the rule of law - at Runnymede, near Windsor, in June 1215. The moment is hailed as one of the most significant in English history.

A thumb bone, also reportedly belonging to the medieval monarch, will also be on display.

Curator Julian Harrison said: 'John's tomb at Worcester Cathedral was opened for a brief period in 1797, and certain of his body parts removed as souvenirs.

'On display in Magna Carta: Law, Liberty, Legacy will be two of King John's molars, taken from the tomb by William Wood, a stationer's apprentice, and kindly being loaned to our exhibition by Worcester City Art Gallery and Museum.

'On show with them will be a thumb bone, reputedly that of King John, which was returned to the cathedral in 1957.

'We're thrilled that we are going to have these items in our Magna Carta exhibition, and we're extremely grateful to the two institutions concerned for so kindly agreeing to lend them to us. '

The first Magna Carta was drafted by the Archbishop of Canterbury and agreed by King John on 15 June 1215 to make peace with a group of rebel barons.

It was reissued and reaffirmed on many occasions in subsequent years. 

The four surviving copies of the original Magna Carta briefly went on show at the library as part of their 800th anniversary. More than 40,000 people entered a public ballot for the chance to see them, with 1,215 being selected to visit the display.

The documents were at the library for three days before being taken to the House of Lords for another day.

Two copies were then returned to the library, while the others went back to their homes at Lincoln and Salisbury cathedrals.

The four original surviving copies were brought together earlier this month for the first time to celebrate the 800th anniversary of its signing. They were displayed at the British Library (pictured)

Speaking of the exhibition, the Lord Speaker, Baroness D'Souza, said: 'Magna Carta established the principle of the rule of law and equality before the law; for 800 years we have been influenced by its contents and it remains one of the most important political documents in the world, with countries such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada tracing constitutional influences back to Magna Carta.'

The Speaker, Rt Hon John Bercow MP, said: 'Over the past eight centuries the public and their Parliament have shaped society and changed the way we live our lives.

'The sealing of the Magna Carta in 1215 and the Montfort parliament of 1265 marked the start of the journey towards modern rights and representation, paving the way for the House of Commons and democracy as we know it today.' 

Earlier this month, a forgotten Magna Carta manuscript which experts said could be worth up to £10million was discovered in a Victorian scrapbook in a Kentish town's archive. 

There are only 24 editions of the Magna Carta in known existence around the world. Pictured: A copy of one of the surviving copies at the British Library 

The parchment, discovered in Sandwich's archive, was ripped and a third had been lost, but experts were able to establish it was issued by Edward I in 1300.  

Archivist Dr Mark Bateson discovered the historical document at the Kent County Council history and library centre in Maidstone.

It is one of only 24 editions of the Magna Carta in known existence around the world. 

The new exhibition at the British Library will also include some items of clothing and part of a leather shoe found in the tomb and King John's will.

Also on show are Thomas Jefferson's handwritten copy of the Declaration of Independence and one of the original copies of the US Bill of Rights.

The exhibition is open from March 13 to September 1. 

Eight centuries after King John sent copies of the first Magna Carta across his kingdom, just four remain.

Two of the survivors are kept at the British Library, were they lay alongside the other two copies which are usually found at Lincoln and Salisbury Cathedrals. 

The two British Library copies came from the private library of the MP and and antique collector Sir Robert Cotton, whose collection of preserved documents laid the foundation for the library back in 1753.

One of these manuscripts was almost destroyed in a fire in 1731, suffering some damage but remaining largely intact. Staff at the British Museum Library in the early 19th century also made it harder to read by using outdated techniques to flatten and mount the historic document. 

The Salisbury Magna Carta has been at the Cathedral since the 13th century. It may have been deposited there by William Longespée, Earl of Salisbury and one of King John’s chief advisers, or it may have come from Elias of Dereham, who supervised the building of the Cathedral from the 1220s.

The manuscript has rarely left the Cathedral in its 800 year history.

The Lincoln Magna Carta has belonged to the Cathedral for 800 years. It is arriving at the British Library directly from the United States after going on display in Massachusetts and Washington, DC, where over 200,000 people viewed it. 

On its return to Lincoln, the manuscript will move from the Cathedral into a new permanent home at the ‘Magna Carta Vault’ in nearby Lincoln Castle.
