Kate Bush fans have ignored the singer's requests to not film her performances during her 22-date tour by uploading photographs and videos from the opening night to social media.

The pop idol had told fans it would 'mean a great deal' to her if those attending her shows at London's Hammersmith Apollo refrained from using iPhones, iPads or cameras.

However, footage emerged on Twitter and YouTube this morning of last night's performance - the opening night of the tour which was attended by a host of celebrities including Lily Allen, Gemma Arterton and Frank Skinner. 

Kate Bush had asked fans not to film or take photos at her show, claiming it would 'mean a great deal' to her. However, several videos and photos emerged on Twitter and YouTube this morning of the star in action (above)

Some fans had criticised the Wuthering Heights singer for making the 'no filming' request ahead of her tour

One video shows the 56-year-old singer swaying from side-to-side on stage as she performs Cloudbusting – the final song of the night – while another, taken from near the back of the venue, is of Among Angels.

Popstar and mother-of-two Lily Allen also posted a photograph of the stage before Bush made her grand entrance.

Captioning the picture simply with 'K8', Allen's image shows the stage lit up ahead of the Wuthering Heights singer's first stage performance in 35 years. 

Several fans have hit out at those who uploaded the content, blasting them for not respecting the singer's wishes.

Writing on her website earlier this month, Bush said: 'I have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. We have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium.

'It would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows. I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.

'I know it's a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together.'

Today, one fan wrote under the video of last night's performance: 'Poor video, poor audio, why did you bother? And isn't this typical of the selfish world we find ourselves in; no respect for others' wishes at all.'

However, while some fans blasted those who uploaded footage to social media, others condemned the star for making the request in the first place.

One user, MagratheaLegend, wrote: 'Banning all photography/filming in this day and age, I thought she had mellowed from all that egocentric nonsense. '

Meanwhile, Julia Greenwood said: 'I respectfully disagree with Kate's request, much as I love her, because even now, I'm not sure she truly understands how much people love her and would do anything to see her live.

'I tried like the dickens to get tickets but was unable. So should I be condemned forever after to never, ever see her perform? Seems unduly harsh and most un-Kate-like to me.'

Another fan added : 'Thank you so so much for sharing this video.

'Not like most of you, I knew about Kate only four years ago and obviously became one of her fans. 

'I'm only 17 and I feel so lucky, lucky enough to see her on stage like this for the first time because I couldn't afford the tickets.'

Last night's show kicked-off the 22-date tour at the Hammersmith Apollo, which was chosen because it was the venue of her last gig on May 14, 1979 - when it was known as the Hammersmith Odeon.

Around 80,000 tickets for the Before The Dawn residency sold out within 15 minutes when put on sale earlier this year.

The singer is not the first musician to criticise gig-goers who spend their time using their mobile devices rather than watching the show.

Roger Daltrey, The Who frontman, recently said it was 'weird' that people seemed to spend more time on their phones than watching a show.

He said: 'I feel sorry for them, I really feel sorry for them. Looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally - if you're doing that, you're 50 per cent there, right? It's weird. I find it weird.'

Performance artist Marina Abramovic also recently barred visitors to her exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London from bringing in their devices, so they could focus more on the art she was creating.

Critics described the opening show as 'spellbinding' as Bush took to the stage for the first time in 35 years

Bush's return to the stage after 35 years went down a storm with critics and fans alike, who hailed her performance as 'spellbinding'.

The first night saw the singer, accompanied by backing singers and a seven-strong band, open with Lily, followed by songs including Hounds Of Love and Running Up That Hill.

Comeback queen Kate Bush has taken the charts by storm with no fewer than 11 of her albums featuring in today's midweek Top 100.

Three of her classic singles have also re-entered the charts.

It comes after the enigmatic singer made a triumphant return to the stage after 35 years in front of a star-studded crowd at the Hammersmith Apollo last night. 

Critics hailed her show a stunning success and her performance made headlines around the world. 

Now her hits collection, The Whole Story, is hovering inside the Top 10 of the album charts at Number 6, while five more - Hounds Of Love (13), The Sensual World (25), 50 Words For Snow (31), The Kick Inside (35) and The Dreaming (37) are also potentially heading for a Top 40 slot when the Official Albums Chart is published on Sunday night.

Also in the Top 100 are Kate's 2011 collection, Director's Cut (58), The Red Shoes (60) Never For Ever (61), Lionheart (64) and Aerial (77).

Kate's chart domination continues on the Official Singles Chart where three of her singles have re-entered midweek - Running Up That Hill (62), Wuthering Heights (77) and This Woman's Work (82).

However, there was nothing from her early albums - not even Wuthering Heights - although her fans didn't seem to mind.

Kyla Fox, 41, who had travelled from Newcastle, said: 'We've just heard musical history. I dreamt of this but never thought I'd see it. This was on my bucket list.'

Michael Anmuth, 46, had come all the way from San Francisco, said: 'It was worth travelling this far because I've waited forever to see her. It has cost me a lot but it's definitely worth it.'

Bush soared to fame in 1979 with her single Wuthering Heights, which she wrote when she was just 18.

The song based on Emily Brontë's dark love story of the same name was followed by hits including Babooshka and Running Up That Hill.

Shy of publicity, she became respected for her uncompromising individualism and refusal to make pop music in anything other than her own style.

She was just 20 when she completed The Tour Of Life with three dates at what was then called the Hammersmith Odeon, after topping the charts with Wuthering Heights the previous year, becoming the first woman to go to number one singing one of her own songs.

Over the years, theories about her absence from the stage have included her perfectionism, a fear of flying and the death of one of the tour crew, lighting director Bill Duffield, during a show.

But in a rare interview with Mojo magazine in 2011 to mark a comeback from one of her lengthy recording silences, she explained that her years of absence from the touring circuit were simply down to the sheer exertion of a show.

She said: 'It was enormously enjoyable. But physically it was absolutely exhausting.' 

MailOnline has contacted representatives of Kate Bush for comment.
