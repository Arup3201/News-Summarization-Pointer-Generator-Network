A second ride has been shut down at the Royal Adelaide Show, where an eight-year-old girl was tragically flung to her death on Friday.

The Royal Adelaide Show has closed the Traffic Jam ride in the Kids Carnival area after a height restriction breach was identified.

The safety breach was discovered on Friday, the same day an eight-year-old girl on holiday from Malaysia was thrown from the Airmaxx 360 ride.

She was rushed to hospital with critical injuries but died a short time later.

SafeWork SA officers increased the number of inspections and compliance checks at the show following the accident.

The agency said an investigation of the death was expected to take some time, given the nature of the incident, the number of witnesses involved and the technical expertise required.

Witness Malinda Dunwoodie, 17, said the girl's safety harness was still on, but it looked as if she slipped out of her seat.

'She was hanging by her legs off the ride, trying to block herself. She went flying through the air about 10-15 metres up in the air and I started sprinting towards her,' she told reporters on Friday.

'I was shaking so much, she looked like a doll flying through the air.

'It was so shocking. It was like a horror movie.'

There were numerous witnesses to the incident that happened at the Royal Adelaide Show on Friday

The Airmaxx 360 was a new ride for the Royal Adelaide show this year, but operated at earlier shows in Sydney and Brisbane without incident.

The eight-year-old girl who died after falling around 10 metres from a spinning ride at the Royal Adelaide Show was holidaying from Malaysia with her family.

The Malaysian consulate in South Australia has confirmed the girl was in Australia on holiday and said the grieving family will have access to support.

Daily Mail Australia has sought comment from the consulate.

Ambulance crews treated the girl at the scene before rushing her to the Women's and Children's Hospital, but she died a short time later.

The child was in a critical condition after the terrifying fall

Police were seen gathered around a brightly coloured ride called 'Air Maxx 360' at the show, after the accident at around 12.30 on Friday.

The girl reportedly came out of her seat high in the air and 'landed extremely far away'.

The girl's mother witnessed the accident, according to Seven News.

Oakden girl Emily Furno, 13, saw the injured girl being taken from the scene.

'She was bleeding everywhere,' she told AAP.

'She didn't look too good. Everyone who saw the accident was in shock.'

Witness Malinda Dunwoodie, 17, told the Adelaide Advertiser the girl's safety harness was still down but it looked as if she slipped out of her seat.

'She was hanging by her legs off the ride, trying to block herself. She went flying through the air about 10-15 metres up in the air and I started sprinting towards her,' she said.

'I was shaking so much, she looked like a doll flying through the air.

'It was so shocking. It was like a horror movie.'

Safework SA confirmed an eight-year-old girl flung from a Royal Adelaide Show ride had died

An unnamed witness said: 'I was looking back and I could see someone lying on the ground and people with towels. It happened so quickly. One second it was fine and the next it was not.'

SA police said they are at the scene and are working with SafeWork SA to investigate the cause of the incident.

They are preparing a report for the Coroner following the tragic death.

Chief Inspector Dennis Lock from Sturt Police said: 'Are thoughts are with the child's family following this tragic and sad incident. I would like to thank all the emergency services people, Royal Show assistants and the numerous members of the public that quickly came to the aid of the girl.'

Police remain at the scene and are working with SafeWork SA to investigate the cause of this incident.

The girl was taken by ambulance to the Woman's and Children's Hospital

Eyewitness said the 8-year-old landed a long way from the ride

A spokesperson for the Royal Agricultural & Horticultural Society said: 'The ride, Air Maxx 360, was a new ride for the Royal Adelaide Show this year.

'However, it operated at both the Sydney Royal Easter Show, and the Brisbane show only a few weeks ago without incident.

'All rides at the show must pass a national compliance audit prior to the show opening and undergo daily checks by operators.

'This will be the subject of a thorough investigation and our heartfelt condolences are with the family.'

In 2000, 37 people were injured when the Spin Dragon ride collapsed in sideshow alley at the annual show.
