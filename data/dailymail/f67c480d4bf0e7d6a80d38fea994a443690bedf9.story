People in Panama feel happiest about their lives, according to a new global well-being poll in which the U.S. finished 12th and the United Kingdom 26th.

There were six Latin American countries in the top 10 in the poll, which asked people to measure their well-being across five key areas.

Panamanians were well above the world average for feeling positive about their lives - 61 per cent were found to be 'thriving' in at least three of the five facets - compared with just 17 per cent internationally.

Latin America is the place to feel happy: Seven of the top 10 countries in the well-being poll hailed from the Americas, with Canada rounding out the top 10. Six of the 10 worst were from Africa

The five elements of the poll were: purpose - liking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve your goals; social - having supportive relationships and love in your life; financial - managing your economic life to reduce stress and increase security; community - liking where you live, feeling safe, and having pride in your community; and physical - having good health and enough energy to get things done daily.

Interviewees were then put into three categories for each element - 'thriving' (well-being that is strong and consistent), 'struggling' (well-being that is moderate or inconsistent), or 'suffering' (well-being that is low and inconsistent). 

Adults in Latin America were found most likely to be thriving, with six of the world's top 10 coming from the region, which was in keeping with a previous Gallup-Healthways poll which found them to have the most positive outlook on life.

Panama came top in four of the five categories, while Sweden was the world leader for financial well-being, with 72 per cent saying they were thriving. 

Costa Rica finished second in the overall rankings, with 44 per cent thriving in three or more categories, while Brazil, Uruguay, El Salvador and Guatemala also made the top 10.

People in sub-Saharan Africa were found to be least satisfied with their lives - just nine per cent of those asked said they were thriving in at least three of the elements.

The data was collected in 2013 for the Gallup-Healthways Global Well-Being Index - which they describe as 'a global barometer of individuals' perceptions of their well-being'. More than 133,000 interviews were carried out in person and over the phone to compile the report.

Those living in poverty-stricken war-zones unsurprisingly had the lowest levels of well-being. In Syria and Afghanistan, just one per cent said they were thriving in three or more elements.

Panama is a country with the best well-being in the world, according to a new Gallup-Healthways poll

People in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Chad, Madagascar, Uganda, and Benin also showed very low levels of happiness with their lives.

More surprisingly, Croatia and Italy were also very low down the list.

The results of the poll also showed how people's perceptions could sometimes differ from reality - for instance, Mexico and Saudi Arabia both came in the top 10 for physical well-being, despite being two of the world's most obese nations. This comes largely down to a lack of education about health.

12. USA - 33 per cent

14. Netherlands - 33 per cent

17. Mexico - 31 per cent

21. Saudi Arabia - 29 per cent

23. Australia - 28 per cent

26. United Kingdom - 28 per cent 

29. Germany - 27 per cent

51. France - 19 per cent

71. India - 15 per cent

90. China - 12 per cent 

118. Italy - 8 per cent

128. Croatia - 7 per cent 

All-in-all, countries in the Americas and Europe came out best for well-being, while worldwide, people felt they were thriving most in the community aspect of life - 26 per cent.

Just 18 per cent of people internationally considered themselves to be thriving in terms of their sense of purpose, while in Asia and the Middle East and Africa, it was just 13 per cent.

Only five countries outside of the Americas and Europe made it into the top 10 for any of the five elements of the poll: Bahrain in financial well-being (48 per cent), Saudi Arabia in community well-being (43 per cent) and physical well-being (39 per cent), Malta in social well-being (47 per cent), and Sri Lanka (50 per cent) and the United Arab Emirates (49 per cent) in community well-being. 

The USA ranked 15th for social well-being, 18th for sense of purpose, 21st for financial well-being and 25th for both physical well-being and community. 

Gallup-Healthways research has shown that those have a higher well-being rating are happier, healthier, work better and are more able to recover from problems than those with a low ranking.

The results do not necessarily correlate with a country's wealth - China has a GDP of nearly $10trillion, but is 90th in the well-being rankings, with just 12 per cent of people thriving in at least three categories.
