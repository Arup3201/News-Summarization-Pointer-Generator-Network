Behind the wheel: Prionda Hill told police God wanted to drive her car when she let go of the wheel and rammed Anthony Oliveri

An Indiana woman was arrested last week after she ran over a motorcyclist, fled the scene and told cops that God told her to let him take the wheel.

Prionda Hill, 25, of Fort Wayne, mowed down Anthony Oliveri, 47, and his motorcycle July 11 just before 10.00 p.m., police said.

‘She was driving and out of nowhere God told her that he would take it from here and she let go of the wheel and let him take it,’ police claim she told them.

Oliveri said he was riding his Harley Davidson motorcycle down a busy street when the bizarre incident occurred.

He said Hill ran over both him and his bike with her 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix.

‘I remember it happened and I didn’t quite know what was going on for a split second,’ he recalled to WANE.

Hill told police she rammed the bike shortly after letting go of the wheel.

The impact threw Oliveri from the bike.

‘As I grabbed the handle bars as the bike was losing control and I looked back around my left shoulder, all I see is her tire and the left bumper getting ready to run my face over.

‘I was inches from that bumper and I just said to myself today is the day I die,’ he continued. ‘I just shut my eyes and said if this is the way that God wants to do it then I guess that this is the way we’re going to do it,’

Instead of crushing Oliveri's head, which would have meant sure death, it motored over his torso and left him with relatively minor injuries.

Oliveri fortunately only suffered a few broken ribs and other minor injuries including road rash.

He has already been discharged from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.

Hill also rammed into a pickup truck before she wound up at a nearby fast food restaurant where police arrested her.

The woman was not drunk at the time, police said, but did claim to have a prescription for Vicodin - a strong painkiller.

She even volunteered there was nothing mechanically wrong with her car.

Hill was charged Thursday with failing to stop an accident, criminal recklessness and two counts of criminal mischief.
