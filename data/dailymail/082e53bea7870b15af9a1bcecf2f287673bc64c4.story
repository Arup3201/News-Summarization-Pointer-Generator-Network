The Rangers Fans Fighting Fund will back The Rangers Supporters Trust with hard cash if need be in their bid to keep Ibrox Stadium out of the clutches of Mike Ashley.

The RST welcomed the 'substantial legal fund available, should it be required,' to fight any attempt to give the Newcastle owner and Gers shareholder security over the cash-strapped club's two biggest assets.

Gers fans protested outside Ibrox before the Championship clash with Hearts on Friday night after it emerged Ashley had filed documents notifying land register bosses that he planned to take out security on the stadium and Murray Park training ground, in return for a reported £10million loan offer.

The future of the Scottish giants remains uncertain following continuing financial problems

Chairman David Somers previously stated that Ibrox would never be used as security against a loan.

A spokesman for the Rangers Fans Fighting Fund said: 'The Rangers Fans Fighting Fund was launched by Ibrox legends Walter Smith and Sandy Jardine in 2012 to help safeguard and protect the club's future and assets.

'In recent days it has become crystal clear that the club's current board is considering the use of Ibrox Stadium and Murray Park in order to secure a further loan from Mike Ashley.

'Mr Ashley already has security over Edmiston House and the Albion Car Park and the RFFF, like almost all Rangers supporters, feels securitising our historic stadium and training ground is a step too far.

'Ibrox, in our view, is sacrosanct. It is a memorial to the sixty six who lost their lives (in the Ibrox Disaster).

'Some of the greatest names in Scottish football history have graced the hallowed turf down the years and it should never be used as collateral in order to secure a loan that is not in the best interests of the club.

'For that reason, the RFFF confirms it is willing to provide support and assistance to any fan group determined to protect the club's assets.

'We enjoyed a positive meeting with representatives from the Rangers Supporters Trust yesterday and we have agreed to back their initiative to prevent the securitisation of Ibrox and Murray Park.

'Rangers fans donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Fighting Fund during the administration process when their club was at risk and it appears our major assets are at risk once again.

'Now, more than ever, we need the Rangers fan base to unite with the collective goal of protecting our assets and taking the club forward.

'FCA rules prevent the direct investment of the RFFF funds in shares.

'Fan ownership initiatives introduced by the Trust and Rangers First can make a positive and immediate difference and the RFFF will do everything possible to provide support to such organisations.

'The fans, after all, are the lifeblood of this great institution and always will be.'

Caretaker manager Kenny McDowall has added to the turmoil by resigning for 'personal reasons'

A statement on the RST website expressed its delight and gratitude to the RFFF's backing and vowed 'to fight any attempt by this board to pass security over Ibrox to Mike Ashley'.

'We will work closely with the RFFF going forward to ensure every avenue is explored,' read the statement.

'The RST is not taking this action for the benefit of only its own members but for every Rangers fan and fan group.

'The RFFF represents a time when all Rangers fans were 100 per cent united in one cause and the board should be under no illusions that we are again.

'We are delighted to provide the necessary legal standing, through our shareholder status, to enable Rangers fans to fight for our spiritual home.

'Derek Llambias, Barry Leach, David Somers and James Easdale should be under no illusions that we will examine every available legal remedy to stop them passing our club's assets to Mr Ashley.

'They are, in our opinion, neglecting their duties to the club, the fans, the PLC and its shareholders in order to do Mr Ashley's bidding.

'There will be a forensic examination of the directors' actions and also the actions of Paul Shackleton and Adrian Hadden at the Nomad, WH Ireland.

'It is our understanding that they would have to agree to, and sign off, the granting of a security over Ibrox and we maintain that proper levels of corporate governance are not being adhered to.

'Should they sign off such a move we will also examine all remedies against them. We thank all Rangers fans for their continuing support in this fight.'
