Newcastle star Darius Boyd has checked out of a Sydney mental health facility following treatment for depression but will not play again this NRL season.

The Knights confirmed on Thursday the Queensland State of Origin winger was released from the facility after being admitted three weeks ago.

'Darius Boyd has completed his rehabilitation program for depression in a Sydney mental health facility,' a statement on the Newcastle Knights website said.

The Newcastle Knights star admitted himself into a Sydney facility on July 23 after problems with his mental health continued to escalate

The 27-year-old noted that football had become his only focus in life, revealing that he neglected his family and friends: an attitude which may have led to his wife Kayla (pictured) temporarily leaving him

'Boyd won't return to playing this season as he continues to focus on his recovery.

'Boyd wishes to thank the club, his teammates and the fans for their support at this time.'

Boyd is off contract at the Knights and, with his long-term mentor Wayne Bennett to return to coach Brisbane next season, speculation is rife the 204-game two-time premiership winner will move back north with him.

The Knights said in the statement Boyd was yet to make a decision on where he would play next year.

Boyd sought treatment at a mental health clinic three weeks ago for depression after he trashed a hotel room on July 17, causing $1,500 worth of damage.

The Knights player and a female companion, believed to be his wife Kayla, reportedly left behind a smashed television, broken glass and a hole in one of the walls when they checked out of the Chateau Elan in the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, last Thursday.

The Daily Telegraph reported the manager of the Hunter Valley resort, Joe Spagnolo, said the incident had not been reported to authorities after the Newcastle Knights player called to apologise and offered to pay for the damage.

It's believed Boyd was given a few days off following the State of Origin with Queensland and had booked one night at the resort.

The revelation came just two days after it was announced Boyd's coach and career mentor Wayne Bennett was leaving the club to return to the Brisbane Broncos - where they first worked together in 2006.

'I donâ€™t know what the two of them were doing and I don't want to know,' Mr Spagnolo said.

'As long as he came good with the money to repair it. The bill came to $1,500 and he's paid it so that's where it's been left,

He said the pair had spa treatments on Wednesday and believed the damage could have happened later that night.

'It's disappointing but I've seen a lot worse. We've had the CEOs of banks driving cars on to the golf course and doing doughnuts and causing all sorts of damage,' Mr Spagnolo said.

'We get a lot of footballers come in and nine times out of 10, there are no problems.'

His admission came less than a week after reports that he'd trashed a hotel room in the Hunter Valley, causing $1,500 worth of damage

The resort's general manager Joe Spagnolo said the incident had not been reported to authorities because Boyd rang to apologise and offered to pay for the damage

At the time of Boyd entering the clinic, Newcastle Knights chief executive Matt Gidley the club's main focus was on the player's health.

'Depression is a serious illness in our society and we are pleased Darius has taken the first step in his recovery by acknowledging he needs help,' Gidley said.

'Football is secondary at this point, it is important Darius' focus is entirely on his treatment.'

Speculation about Boyd's future has been rampant since it was announced Bennett would return to the Brisbane side after he quit as Knights coach last month.

The fullback was immediately linked to Bennett's movement because he has played under the coach his entire career - following him from Brisbane to St George Illawarra, then to Newcastle.

Boyd is tipped to follow his coach yet again back to the Broncos next season.
