A heavily pregnant woman has died in a car crash - but her baby son has survived thanks to two quick-thinking troopers and a passing nurse.

Rebecca Hodge Williams, 24, was driving south along County Line Road in Gastonia, North Carolina at 7.50am on Tuesday shortly after finishing up a night shift when her Suberu Impreza went off the right side of the road and she over-corrected, according to the Highway Patrol.

She careened across the road and a Chevrolet Equinox SUV traveling north slammed into her passenger door.

The young mother-to-be, who was due to give birth in just two weeks, died at the scene. 

Saved: Riley Andrew Williams was delivered by c-section on Tuesday morning after his mother was killed when she collided with another vehicle. He was saved after troopers performed CPR on his mother's body

A passerby alerted a trooper who was working a small wreck less than a mile from the scene and the officer went to the Williams' car, pulled her out and started performing CPR.

Another trooper shortly arrived on the scene, before a  nurse from Cleveland Regional Hospital, who happened to be passing in her car, pulled over to help them with CPR.

They continued to perform CPR on the mother, who was already dead, for 20 minutes so that her baby could get oxygen, Trooper Brian Huffstickler told DailyMail.com. Without it, the young boy would surely have died, he said.

'God put me in the right place at the right time,' the unnamed trooper who was first called to the scene told WSOC. 

Williams was taken to Gaston Regional Hospital and her baby son was delivered by cesarean section before being taken to Levine Children's Hospital in Charlotte.

The newborn was named Riley Andrew Williams and weighs 7lbs 5oz.

Tragic: Rebecca Hodge Williams, 24, was pronounced dead at the scene on Tuesday morning. Troopers believe she had veered off the road and then overcorrected, sending her into the path of oncoming traffic

Excitement: Over the past several months, Williams had shared ultrasounds of her baby, pictured, as she looked forward to his birth. She was due on January 19, just two weeks away

He has a strong heartbeat, but is still suffering from lack of oxygen, officials said.

Last year, Williams had shared her pregnancy joy on Facebook, uploading ultrasounds of the baby's progress throughout July and October.

In November, she shared another ultrasound with a message reading: 'It's a boy!'

Troopers said the female driver of the SUV was not hurt in the wreck. Everyone involved in the crash was wearing their seatbelt, they said.

Troopers believe Williams had headed home after her night shift but had left again shortly afterwards when she got into the crash. She lived just a mile and a half from the crash scene.
