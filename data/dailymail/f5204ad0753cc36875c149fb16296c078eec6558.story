Bipolar: Mr Oddie, who shot to fame in comedy series The Goodies in the 1970s, fears it has become 'fashionable' to speak out about conditions like his

A number of celebrities have spoken of their battles with mental illness, many in an effort to try and remove the stigma associated with their conditions.

Now one of their number has decided to step back from his charity work because he feels some stars are using their condition to further their careers - and may actually be skewing the way conditions are understood by the public.

Broadcaster Bill Oddie, 72, suffers from bipolar disorder and has spoken of being hospitalised with the condition after he was sacked from the BBC series Springwatch.

The Bipolar UK patron, who shot to fame in comedy series The Goodies in the 1970s, fears it has become 'fashionable' to speak out about conditions like his.

He said: 'I rather think that too much can be made of these things by celebrities, and I often don’t feel it does an awful lot of good.

'Stephen Fry brought a lot of attention to it, and Ruby Wax, but I don’t think that the life of a celebrity can be compared to, or relatable to, a normal, everyday life, so I don’t know how much good it really does,' he told the Sunday Telegraph.

'I’m not knocking it. I am just saying that I don’t think celebrities are necessarily the people to bring true understanding of the condition.'

Both Fry and Wax are bipolar sufferers and speak openly about the condition. Wax toured mental institutions for two years and created Black Dog Tribe, a  website for people affected by depression and other mental health issues.

She has also published a book, Sane 
New World, which looks at stress and depression in the modern era and 
has a masters from Oxford in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy.

Ruby Wax and Stephen Fry have undertaken charity and awareness work for mental health issues. Wax also has a degree in Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy

The
 comedian has penned a response to Mr Oddie on her blog. She said: 
'Obviously Bill did not read the book and yet claims it’s about 
depression. I don’t work in TV and haven’t for many years.

'I
 am now touring my show to bring awareness to small audiences.  I wonder
 what he’s doing besides criticising someone who is trying to help.

Children from wealthy families with pushy parents are more at risk of developing mental health problems, researchers have discovered.

Youngsters from affluent homes are seeing a major rise in levels of neuroses that lead to drug abuse, crime and eating disorders.

Depression and anxiety – the major factors behind such behaviour – is almost twice the normal rate in children whose parents earn more than £100,000 a year, according to the study.

Many were simply unable to cope with the constant demands for ‘high-octane achievement’ from aspirational parents, said US psychologist Suniya Luthar.

'Unfortunately,
 we live in a society that listens to celebrities. I don’t feel great 
about that but it is the reason Comic Relief makes millions each year.

'I
 think we should thank Stephen Fry for being the first to speak out, 
it’s a very brave thing to do and he didn’t have to to improve his 
career.'

Mr Oddie has previously claimed that
 the BBC ‘put him in hospital’ with crippling depression when it dropped
 him from Springwatch four years ago.

The
 presenter said his pre-existing illness reached a crisis point when the
 broadcaster unexpectedly sacked him from the popular wildlife series.

Oddie, 72, says he was forced out following an investigation into his behaviour during filming. At the time, the BBC put his dismissal down to his health problems.

He suspects that his mood swings upset colleagues and members of the public during filming on location at Brownsea Island in Dorset.

But he says he can’t understand the decision to fire him just before Christmas 2008, and that it plunged him into a despair which culminated in admission to London’s Capio Nightingale psychiatric hospital in March 2009.

Bipolar disorder, known in the past as manic depression, is a condition that affects moods, which can swing from one extreme to another - depression and mania.

Unlike simple mood swings, each extreme episode of bipolar disorder can last for several weeks or longer, and some people may not experience a 'normal' mood very often.

During an episode of depression, sufferers may have overwhelming feelings of worthlessness, which can potentially lead to thoughts of suicide.

During a manic phase of bipolar disorder, people with the condition may feel very happy and have lots of ambitious plans and ideas. They may spend large amounts of money on things they cannot afford and would not normally want.

Not feeling like eating or sleeping, talking quickly and becoming annoyed easily are also common characteristics of the manic phase of bipolar disorder.
