A petition calling on the network A&E to reinstate Phil Robertson on the hit reality show Duck Dynasty has now met - and surpassed - its target of 250,000 signatures.

As of Friday morning, more than 253,000 supporters of the controversial reality star have electronically signed to have him back on the show after he had been suspended indefinitely for making homophobic and racially charged remarks during an interview with GQ magazine.  

The petition is being spearheaded by the Christian conservative group Faith Driven Consumer, which is also behind the site IStandWithPhil.com.

Executives at A&E have admitted that they could have done more to dampen the hysteria surrounding Phil Robertson's anti-gay remarks by immediately taking the hit reality show off the air for two weeks

Cause celebre: A petition calling on the network A&E to reinstate Phil Robertson on the hit show Duck Dynasty has surpassed - its target of 250,000 signatures

Bowing to pressure? A&E is set to rake in mountains of ad revenue as the network decides to air 11-hour Duck Dynasty marathon in spite of star Phil Robertson's anti-gay tirade

An open letter accompanying the 
petition accuses A&E of 'intolerant, discriminatory, and punitive 
treatment' of the 67-year-old Robertson patriarch.

The
 author goes on to say that Robertson's comments equating homosexuality 
with terrorism and bestiality 'are simply reflective of a biblical view 
of sexuality, marriage and faith - a view that has stood the test of 
time for thousands of years and continues to be held by the majority of 
Americans and today’s world as a whole.'

The
 right-wing organization has condemned A&E for discriminating 
against Robertson for expressing a perspective conflicting with the 
LGBT agenda, calling it ‘patently un-American.'

The
 goal of the petition is to have Robertson back on the show and force 
A&E to formally apologize to him, his family and their supporters.

The
 letter concludes with a stern warning that if the group's demands are 
not met, tens of millions of ‘Faith Driven Consumers’ in the U.S. will 
stop watching A&E programming altogether.

Duck Dynasty, the most popular reality show of all times following the foibles of the Robertson family in Monroe, Louisiana - the site of their successful duck call business - has been embroiled in controversy since homophobic quotes made by Robertson in the January 2014 issue of GQ Magazine became public last Wednesday.

In
 the immediate aftermath of the scandal, A&E sought to distance 
itself from Robertson by suspending him indefinitely, and saying 'his 
personal views in no way reflect those of A&E'.

Robertson's fans, from average viewers to political leaders, have been hard at work lobbying for his return.

A Facebook page called 'Boycott A&E Until Phil Robertson Is Put Back on Duck Dynasty' has sprung up, drawing more than 1.7 million 'likes.'

A second petition on Change.org titled 'A&E Network: Bring Phil Robertson back!' has more than 118,600 signers.

Robertson, the patriarch of the Louisiana clan on the reality show about hunting, fishing and domestic squabbles, was put on indefinite hiatus by A&E last week for his remarks to GQ magazine characterizing homosexuality as sinful behavior.

The network has previously said it was disappointed after reading Robertson's remarks, which it added were his personal views and did not reflect those of the network.

Civil rights groups GLAAD strongly  criticized the comments, but the 67-year-old Robertson also found supporters among Republican politicians such as former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas.

However, in a Monday interview with Fox News anchor Great Van Susteren, the former Alaska governor admitted that she came to Robertson's defense without ever reading his interview in GQ. 

'I haven’t read the article,' Palin said. 'I don’t know exactly how he said it.'

The future of the popular series, 
which is scheduled to begin its previously taped fifth season on Jan. 
15, is up in the air following Robertson's indefinite suspension and his
 family hinted that they would not participate without him.

‘We
 have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a 
family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch 
at the helm,' the family said in a statement last Thursday.

The
 standoff between the Robertson family and A&E has put big money in 
the balance as the impasse also threatens a vast array of 'Duck Dynasty'
 licensed merchandise that has brought in some $400 million, according 
to Forbes magazine.

The show's fourth season debuted in August to 11.8 million viewers, a record for a cable nonfiction series, A&E said.

It
 averages about eight million viewers per episode and its Christmas 
special was most-watched non-sports cable program on U.S. television 
last week.

The fifth season of the show, which includes episodes featuring Robertson, begins airing January 15.
