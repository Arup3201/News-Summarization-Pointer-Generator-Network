A man with a distinctive 'cutthroat' tattoo on his neck has been charged today with brutally slashing a teenagers throat from ear-to-ear as he robbed him of $350.

Norristown, Pennsylvania, resident, Shakeem Carter, 20, is accused of stabbing 17-year-old Kevin Allen 20 times in the head, back, and neck with such violent force that the knife he used in the attack became bent.

After slitting Allen's throat, Carter is then said to have covered the body with cooking oil, setting him on fire in his home after breaking in to rob of him the money on February 12th.

Shakeem Carter, 20, has been charged with the brutal murder of Kevin Allen, a 17-year-old who was robbed of $350 and stabbed and then set on fire

Carter is currently being held at Chester County prison without bail and the crude tattoo visible on his neck in the police mug shot - the word Cutthroat surrounded by flames licking upward toward his chin -  is what identified him as the suspect, police said

'This was a robbery,' said Chester County District Attorney Tom Hogan at a press conference to announce the arrest.

'$350 for a young man's life.' 

At the news conference held yesterday announcing the arrest, Hogan displayed the three knives allegedly used to kill Allen. And he described the crime in detail. -

Describing the gruesome scene on entering apartment 127 of the Hanover Garden Apartments in North Coventry, Pennsylvania, Chester County District Attorney said it felt like they had opened 'a doorway to hell'.

Allen's body was found in the blood soaked apartment after a neighbor called 911 on hearing his desperate struggle to stay alive as Carter attacked him.

'When we opened that door into apartment 127, that was a doorway into hell,' said Hogan reported The Patch.Com

'There was blood covering the stairs, there was blood covering the door...and on the walls on either side.'

The teen's body was found lying face down between the living room and the kitchen.

'He had been stabbed in the back far enough through to hit vital organs,' said Hogan.

'He had been stabbed in the head, and one of those stab wounds actually penetrated his skull. His throat was cut from the midline all the way across.'

Kevin Allen was stabbed over 20 times, had his throat slit and then was set on fire as he was robbed of $350

Police found evidence of defensive wounds on Allen's hands, showing that he tried to fight his way out of the situation.

'He was fighting for his life,' said Hogan. 'He did not want to go down this way.'

Police recovered evidence from the scene including several kitchen knives and several empty bottles of cooking oil, all with blood on them. According to Hogan, the oil had been used to burn the body.

The subsequent police investigation led them to Carter, who was known to Allen and who had traveled with him on a bus on the evening of the attack.

Police have theorized that Allen may have been speaking to a friend on his cell-phone and divulged that he was going to his house to pick up money his dad had left for clothes.

Surveillance video reportedly shows Carter with Allen on the bus and then a while later on his own counting a stack of money.

'What's the value of a young man's life today?' Hogan asked reporters at the Wednesday morning press conference. '$350, sadly is the value of a young man's life today. And that is a tragedy.'
