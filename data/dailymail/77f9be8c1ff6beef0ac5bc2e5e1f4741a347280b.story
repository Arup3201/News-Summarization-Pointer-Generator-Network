An adopted teenager was charged with two counts of murder today after police found the bodies of his parents stashed under a blanket inside the family car.

Moses Kamin, 15, appeared in court and was charged as an adult over the deaths of his parents, two highly-educated civil servants, last week. Â 

Police went to the house twice on Friday to check on Robert Kamin, 55, and Susan Poff, 50, after their employers reported that they didn't show up for work.

After discovering the couple dead, police questioned their son who  later confessed to strangling his parents in Oakland, California.

Police have not revealed why Moses allegedly murdered his parents but there have been suggestions the boy was suffering from depression and having problems at a new school.

Colleagues of the couple also told the 
San Francisco Chronicle that the couple had been having problems with 
their son, who they believed was spending too much time in the Occupy 
Oakland camp.

The San Francisco Chronicle reported he was adopted within the last ten years.

Mr
Kamin was a clinical psychologist in the San Francisco County jail 
system. Mrs Poff worked as a physician assistant at the Housing and 
Urban Health Clinic for the city's health department. She had mentored 
hundreds of medical students and nurses.

Remembered: Friends and relatives at the home in Oakland California, where the family had recently moved

Police said the couple's son killed them 
on Thursday and then hit their bodies beneath blankets in the family's 
PT Cruiser outside. The teen allegedly had tried to set the car on fire.

Officers arrived at the house on Friday afternoon when the couple's co-workers reported they hadn't shown up for work.

A police source familiar with the case told the Chronicle a co-worker first called the son, who said his parents were out for a walk.

The newspaper reports that police arrived to the home near Lake Meritt in Oakland on Friday and spoke with the boy, but found nothing suspicious.

Grisly discovery: Police found the bodies of the couple outside the new house they were renovating

When a second call from the co-worker 
called the house came in, the boy reportedly said he was in the bathroom
and could not pass the phone, prompting the co-worker to phone police 
again.

Authorities returned to the home and 
noticed charring on the car parked outside, which appeared as if someone had tried to set it alight.

Looking inside, they saw a 
limb sticking out beneath a blanket. When officer opened the car doors,
they discovered Mr Kamin and Mrs Poff dead.

Initially the boy was said to have denied any involvement but later confessed to authorities, according to the Chronicle.

The
boy was arrested on suspicion of murder on Saturday. He is being held 
at the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center in San Leandro.

Protests: Colleagues of the couple said they had argued with their teenage son about how much time he was spending at the Occupy Oakland camp

Co-workers mourned the well-known couple 
after news of their murders became public. Mrs Poff's boss called her 
death 'a terrible loss'.

Joshua Bamberger told the Oakland Tribune: 'I've never met anyone who lived with as little ambivalence about making the world a better place.

'She was one of the most loving, heartfelt, solid and wise persons who ever cared for people living in poverty.'

Poff, who attended UC Berkley, and Kamin, a graduate of Stanford University, met through friends. The couple adopted because they were unable to have their own children, Robert Kamin's brother Bruce told the Chronicle. They had recently moved to the area and were in the middle of renovating their house.
