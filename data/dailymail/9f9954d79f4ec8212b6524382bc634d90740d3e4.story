Walk-out: Charge d'affaires Khaled al-Ayoubi told the British authorities that he was 'no longer willing' to represent the Syrian government at the embassy in London

Syria's most senior diplomat to Britain yesterday defected in ‘revulsion’ at the violence.

He deserted his post as a refugee crisis erupted in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city.

Khaled al-Ayoubi, the charge d’affaires in London, told the Foreign Office he could no longer represent President Bashar al-Assad’s brutal regime.

More than 200,000 have fled Aleppo after Assad unleashed helicopter gunships and fighter jets on rebels who had seized swathes of the city.

An unknown number are still trapped and a serious food shortage is developing.

Mr Ayoubi’s unexpected defection represents another crack in Assad’s government, whose suppression of the 18-month uprising has claimed 19,000 lives.

The Foreign Office said: ‘Mr Ayoubi has told us that he is no longer willing to represent a regime that has committed such violent and oppressive acts against its own people.

‘We urge others around Bashar al-Assad to follow Mr Ayoubi’s example, to disassociate themselves from the crimes being committed against the Syrian people and to support a peaceful and free future for Syria.’

A spokesman said it was not known if Mr Ayoubi would transfer his support to the rebels.

He was staying in a safe location in the UK and was in contact with British officials, he said.

Mr Ayoubi’s departure leaves five staff at the Syrian embassy after his predecessor and two others were expelled at the end of May, and Syria’s ambassador to the UK Sami Khiyami quit, citing ‘ill health’.

Britain withdrew its ambassador to Damascus earlier this year.

Yesterday’s announcement came after the United Nations reported that 200,000 Syrians had fled Aleppo, where government forces have been bombarding rebels for 10 days.

Those fleeing the violence have described incessant shelling, constant gunfire, food shortages and power cuts.

Many are heading to Jordan after reports that the country has opened its first refugee camp for those caught up in the fighting.

Civilians unable to flee have been forced to crowd together in buildings and basements to escape the heavy shelling.

Baroness Amos, the top UN official for humanitarian affairs, said: ‘I am extremely concerned. Many people have sought temporary shelter in schools and other public buildings in safer areas.

‘They urgently need food, mattresses and blankets, hygiene supplies and drinking water.’

US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said the use of heavy weapons, particularly helicopters, was ‘another nail in President Bashar Assad’s coffin’.

On Sunday, the opposition Syrian National Council 
(SNC) accused the government of preparing to carry out 
'massacres' in Aleppo and pleaded for heavy weapons to enable
rebels to meet the regime onslaught.

Colonel Abdel Jabbar al-Oqaidi, a Free
Syrian Army commander in Aleppo, said the rebels had inflicted heavy 
losses on the army in Salaheddin but that there had been many civilian 
deaths.

'Aleppo will be the 
graveyard of the tanks of the Syrian army,' Oqaidi told AFP in an 
interview at an isolated farmhouse near the 
city.

'We ask the West for a no-fly zone' in order to prevent aerial operations by Assad's forces, he said.

The colonel said his men were 
positioned across Aleppo and would not withdraw as they had when they 
came under intense fire from regime troops in Damascus earlier this 
month.

'There is no 
strategic withdrawal of the Free Syrian Army. We await the attack,' he 
said, while refusing to reveal how many rebels were fighting in Aleppo.

'We
expect [the army] to commit a very great slaughter, and we urge the 
international community to intervene to prevent these crimes,' he said.

The British-based Observatory reported that 67 people were killed across the country on Sunday.

Peace envoy Kofi Annan has urged both sides 
to hold back, saying only a political solution can end a conflict that
rights activists say has killed more than 20,000 people since the 
uprising erupted in March 2011.
