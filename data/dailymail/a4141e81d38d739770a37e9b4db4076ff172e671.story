A team of Finnish fashion designers have created a new range of swimwear for women with one breast. 

A series of women who have had a mastectomy after breast cancer modelled the costumes for these stunning pictures, which are being exhibited in Finland, Sweden and Norway.

The project, titled Monokini 2.0, aims to re-examine the public’s view of what women, beauty and physical appearance.

Body beautiful: The Monokini 2.0 project was inspired by Elina Halttunen, pictured here, a breast cancer sufferer who had a mastectomy

Gorgeous: Virve models a Monokini swimming costume. 'It was an amazing experience to be part of a project as great as this,' she says. 'I hope my participation gives strength and courage to my sisters in same situation. Living with one breast can be amazing!'

The project is run by artistic duo 
Katriina Haikala and Vilma Metteri, who call themselves, Tärähtäneet 
ämmät, aka, Nutty Tarts.

It was inspired by Elina Halttunen, a breast cancer sufferer who had a mastectomy.

Whilst
 a large number of women chose to opt for reconstructive surgery after a
 mastectomy, many, like Elina, chose to have just one breast and embrace
 their new body.

Elina went shopping, but could not find suitable 
swimwear for her shape.

Inspiring: 'Cancer has drilled holes to my bones and taken away my breast,' says Marjaana, posing here in a velvet dress. 'I don't let it in my mind to steal all the precious things in me'

Proud: 'This is absolutely the most remarkable project that I've ever seen, heard, or been part of,' says Reetta, left. Milsse, right, calls the project, 'empowering'

‘We
 strive to expand what is accepted and considered beautiful by designing
 a swimwear collection for women who have gone through breast cancer and
 mastectomy,’ Katriina Haikala, 
tells Mail Online.

‘Elina 
Halttunen contacted us two years ago. As artists we had been dealing 
with the questions of gender, sexuality and norms and Elina knew about 
it.

‘Elina has had her other breast removed 10 years ago and she did not want to have a reconstruction operation.

‘We are amazed by courage of the women modelling for us and by
 the amount of positive feedback we are receiving!’

Elina is one of the 10 models in the exhibition. She shows off her amazing body in a striking orange piece from the range.

Stunning: Kritstiina, left, wears a metallic costume dress made up of black, bronze and silver sequins. Camilla, right, wears a black one-piece featuring a bright pink and green flower design. 'This was my moment of glory,' she says

'We love it!' Sirpa, left, and Solja, right, models elaborate costumes designed by Monokini 2.0

She designed the costume herself, and says: 'I do not want to hide, I do not want to stop swimming, I do not want to undergo extensive plastic surgery operations and I do not want to be forced to use the uncomfortable prosthesis on the beach.

'I want to feel as free and active as I did before my cancer, and Monokini 2.0 gives me a chance to do exactly that.'

Each
 costume is different. One, modelled by ‘Kritstiina,’ is a cross between
 a swimming costume and a metallic dress. It’s made up of black, bronze 
and silver sequins.

‘Camilla’
 wears a black one-piece featuring a bright pink and green flower 
design. She wears it with black gloves, pink heels and a black head 
piece.

As well as the unique
 costumes, the women wear heels and either statement head pieces or have
 their hair styled dramatically for the works out art.

The name Monokini 2.0 was inspired by Rudi Gernreich, who designed a swimsuit that exposed both breasts in the sixties.

‘His Monokini was meant as a cultural statement,’ explains Vilma Metteri.

‘It was about a changing culture throughout all society, about freedom and emancipation.

'This
 is what we want to achieve with our Monokini 2.0. And we hope that if 
Rudi’s Monokini made it easier for women to go topless on the beach if 
they wanted to, our Monokini 2.0 will make it easier for women to go 
breastless on the beach if they want to.’
