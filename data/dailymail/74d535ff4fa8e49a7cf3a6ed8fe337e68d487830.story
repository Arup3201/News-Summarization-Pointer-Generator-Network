Eddie Jordan, the former team owner and BBC pundit, has called on Bernie Ecclestone to stand down as Formula One’s ruler.

Jordan is a long-time admirer of Ecclestone, but he feels the 84-year-old’s increasingly erratic statements mean he should retire and hand the sport on to the next generation.

‘Bernie says one thing to your paper, another thing to a different paper, and another thing to me,’ Jordan told Sportsmail. ‘It is out of control. Nobody knows whether he means what he says or even knows what he is saying.

‘One moment he said he wanted to help the smaller teams out of their financial trouble; then the next moment that he didn’t care about them.

‘He said they had come to him with begging bowls.

‘And last week he said he did not want to get the younger generation interested in F1. Perhaps if he doesn’t want them and doesn’t understand social media, he should hand over to someone who does.

‘We are only custodians of the sport. We have a responsibility to the next generation to hand it over in a fit, healthy and competitive state.

‘Retirement comes to everybody and I believe it is time for Bernie to consider whether he should retire.’

Jordan’s criticism was partly a reaction to Ecclestone’s interview in Campaign Asia-Pacific magazine last week in which he said: ‘I don’t know why people want to get to the so-called young generation. 

'Why do they want to do that? Is it to sell them something? Most of these kids haven’t got any money. I’d rather get to the 70-year-old guy who’s got plenty of cash.’
