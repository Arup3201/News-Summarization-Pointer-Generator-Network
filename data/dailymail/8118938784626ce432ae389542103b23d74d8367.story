It has boosted loved lives across the world - but new research suggests men who take Viagra may significantly increase their risk of skin cancer.

American researchers found those who took sildenafil, more commonly known as Viagra, were 84 per cent more likely to get melanoma, the most deadly form of the disease.

It is thought the impotence drug may affect the same genetic mechanism that enables skin cancer to become more invasive.

Risk? Men who used Viagra had were 84 per cent more likely to be diagnosed with melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, a study found

However the researchers add that because the study is preliminary, it is too early to advise men to stop taking the little blue pill.

'Because it’s just one early study, no one is suggesting that men stop taking Viagra to treat erectile dysfunction,' study co-author Dr Abrar Qureshi, professor of dermatology at Brown University, told NBC News.

But he advised those taking Viagra who have a high risk of melanoma should think about speaking with their doctor.

He added that the risk of less dangerous - and more common skin cancers, such as basal cell or squamous cell cancers - was no higher in men who took the drug.

The study, of 26,000 men in the U.S and 
China, analysed information from the Health Professionals’ Follow-up 
Study, which collects data about male healthcare workers (including 
doctors).

Doctors say the Viagra effect held even after factors such as a man's sun exposure and family history were taken into account

Of those included in the study, the average age was 65 and six per cent had taken the erectile dysfunction drug.

The research, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine this week, showed that men who took Viagra even once had double the risk of developing melanoma.

Dr Qureshi added that risk factors for skin cancer - such as the amount of sunlight exposure a man had and family history of the disease - had been taken into account.

Other well-known side-effects of Viagra include heartburn, nausea and headaches.

The drug is also unsuitable for men with angina or very high blood pressure.
