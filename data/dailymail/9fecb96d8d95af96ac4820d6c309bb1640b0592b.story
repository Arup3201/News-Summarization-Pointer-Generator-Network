When it emerged Tesco had been selling beef burgers contaminated with horse meat, the last people you would expect to see the funny side were its customer care team.

But the supermarket giant has found itself at the centre of an internet storm after a tweet posted on its Twitter feed informed shoppers yesterday that its staff were off to 'hit the hay'.

The ill-judged quip triggered a bombardment of angry responses from followers who didn't find the damaging revelations quite so amusing.

Supermarket bosses were quick to backtrack, desperately apologising to offended clients, saying that the tweet had been 'scheduled' before the scandal broke - two days earlier.

But that only stoked the anger further, triggering questions as to why the tweet was not pulled before being sent.

Bad taste? The controversy began at 11pm last night when the supermarket chain's customer care team tweeted this

It began at 11pm last night when the 
team tweeted: 'It's sleepy time so we're off to hit the hay! See you at 
8am for more #TescoTweets'.

Immediately, hundreds of the company's followers replied, condemning the pun for its inappropriate timing and bad taste.

Jake Mulley wrote: 'How can you joke about the horse meat scandal abnd tell us you're hitting the hay? Because it was funny?'

joke is ON you. Wonder if you'll be laughing when getting sued.'

Trouble: The supermarket giant has found itself at the centre of an internet storm after a tweet posted in its Twitter account informed shoppers yesterday its staff were off to 'hit the hay'

The team was quick to apologise, copying and pasting the same apology to every customer who complained.

'I'm terribly sorry,' it tweeted. 
'That tweet was scheduled before we knew of the current situation. We'd 
never intend to make light of it.'

However, claiming the tweet had been scheduled before the scandal broke, only stoked customers' fury further.

A spokesperson for Tesco said today: 'Our customer services team have apologised directly to any customers who were upset by our pre-programmed tweet.'

Backlash: The 'inappropriate' quip triggered a flurry of angry responses from followers who didn't find the damaging revelations quite so amusing

It is not the first Twitter gaffe the department has made since the horse meat scandal exploded, spawning a flurry of horse-related puns on the social networking site.

One user asked: 'Is it true you have started stocking RED RUM? And is it like your regular rum?'

Tesco Customer Care was happy to help, responding: 'I can't seem to find anything under red rum. Are you able to let me know which store you shop in so i can double check?'

Apology: The team was quick to apologise, copying and pasting the same apology to every customer who complained

The alert was first raised by Irish 
food watchdogs earlier this week after horse DNA was found in burgers 
sold through Tesco, Iceland, Aldi, Lidl and Dunnes in Ireland.

It subsequently emerged that burgers 
from the same batches were sold in the British outlets of both Tesco and
Iceland. Incredibly, the beef content in one Everyday Value burger sold
by Tesco was actually 29 per cent horse meat.

Withdrawn: Ten million beefburgers have been recalled by British supermarkets after it emerged many may have been contaminated with horse meat

More
than ten million burgers have now been removed from sale, including more 
than 100,000 made at the Yorkshire factory of Dalepak.

Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and the Co-op
immediately decided to remove thousands of packs of frozen burgers as a
precautionary measure.

David Cameron reacted angrily, condemning Tesco yesterday, saying: 'People in our country will have been very 
concerned to read this morning that when they thought they were buying 
beef burgers they were buying something that had horse meat in it.'

Oh dear: It is not the first Twitter gaffe the department has made since the horse meat scandal exploded, spawning a flurry of horse-related puns on the social networking site

'This
is a completely unacceptable state of affairs,' he added, calling for 
an urgent investigation by Britain's Food Standards Agency.

Labour
says comprehensive food tests are needed to let families know how far 
horse meat contamination has spread into the food supply.

Also today, it was revealed there is no evidence of contamination of horse DNA in Burger King products, a major food group has insisted.

Scandal: How the Daily Mail covered the story on Wednesday

The ABP Food Group, one of Europe's 
biggest suppliers and processors, suspended all production at one of its
plants in Co Monaghan, Ireland, after tests found contamination in 
frozen burgers.

The alert was first raised by Irish food watchdogs earlier this week after horse DNA was found in burgers sold through Tesco, Iceland, Aldi, Lidl and Dunnes in Ireland.

It subsequently emerged that burgers from the same batches were sold in the British outlets of both Tesco and Iceland. Incredibly, the beef content in one Everyday Value burger sold by Tesco was actually 29 per cent horse meat.

More than ten million burgers have now been removed from sale, including more than 100,000 made at the Yorkshire factory of Dalepak.

Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and the Co-op immediately decided to remove thousands of packs of frozen burgers as a precautionary measure.

But it has since insisted that meat for fast-food giant Burger King was produced and stored separately at the plant.

It
said: 'We would like to reiterate that all Burger King products 
produced by us are stored separately and manufactured on an independent 
line.

'There is no evidence of any contamination of raw material used for the manufacture of any Burger King products.'

The group revealed last night it had stopped work at its Silvercrest Foods plant in Co Monaghan until further notice.

The firm said that, following new 
results from the Irish Department of Agriculture, it believes the source
of the contaminated material is one supplier.

Ten
million burgers suspected of containing some levels of horse meat were 
cleared from several supermarkets' freezers across Ireland and the UK 
this week and are expected to be destroyed.

The
scandal comes just a week after Chief Executive Philip Clarke said 
Tesco was "back on form" in Britain after beating analysts' forecasts 
for Christmas sales.

Tesco had hailed a successful relaunch of its meat 
ranges as a contributing factor to its strongest sales growth in three 
years.

Empty shelves: Tesco had taken its frozen burgers off the shelves as some contained 29% horse meat - but it appears that they could have been on the shelves for years because of inadequate testing

Not for sale: Tesco in Bristol had removed all its own brand burgers from sale

Shares in Britain's biggest retailer fell as much as 1.7 percent on Wednesday, knocking 480 million pounds off its market value, reacting to news late Tuesday that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) had found horse DNA in beef burger products sold by Tesco in the UK and Ireland.

The FSAI said beef burgers sold at Dunnes Stores, Lidl, Aldi and Iceland were also discovered to contain horse DNA.

Old ways are the best: A still from an old Tesco television advert

Tesco bosses have been forced to scrap part of their latest television advert - because it was due to include images of a horse.

The new ad had been planned weeks in advance of the horse meat scandal and was due to be unveiled later this month, complete with two separate shots of a cute-looking equine.

Tesco have confirmed that the scenes have been hastily edited out, following the revelation that traces of horse DNA have been found in beef burgers sold by the supermarket giant.

A spokesman for Tesco said: 'We have re-edited a new advert which had included a horse in the original version. It will be broadcast next week.'

The exact details of what the horse was doing in the advert are being kept hush-hush but it is thought that the original plan was to use it in a humorous context.

An industry source commented: 'Just when you think things couldn't get any worse, imagine the reaction it would of caused if Tesco had trotted out an advert with a horse after apologizing for unwittingly selling horsemeat in beef-burgers.

'There was understandably a lot of sensitivity about the issue at Tesco and so the offending scenes were very quickly binned.'

The ad is understood to have been in the final stages of editing at a top London production house when the DNA scandal broke.
