 England Under 17s will take on Italy, Portugal and the Czech Republic in the FA International Tournament later this month.

The European champions will prepare for another round of qualifying by playing three times in the space of five days in the annual competition, to be staged across the Midlands.

John Peacock's Young Lions will start against the Czech Republic at Kidderminster's Aggborough ground on Wednesday August 27.

They will then take on Portugal at Chesterfield's Proact Stadium on Friday August 29, before rounding off against Italy at Burton Albion's Pirelli Stadium two days later.

The matches in the round-robin format not involving England will be played at Alfreton Town and Tamworth.

Peacock said: 'It's always a good opportunity to test ourselves against some of the top nations at this age group level and we're looking forward to it as always.

'This will be the first season in a competitive UEFA tournament for the players and getting used to playing a four-group schedule like this is important in preparing us for the tests ahead.'

England have been drawn with France, Cyprus and Macedonia in Group Four of the qualifying round for the next European Championships, to be held next summer in Bulgaria.

The Under 17s have just returned from the annual Nordic Tournament, where they beat Iceland, drew with Finland and lost to Sweden in the group stage before losing 1-0 to hosts Denmark in the third-place play-off.

Tickets cost £3 for adults and £1.50 for U16s per game and can be purchased through each of the relevant host clubs.
