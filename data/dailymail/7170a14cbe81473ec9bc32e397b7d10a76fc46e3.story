Smiling Connor Levy is a happy, healthy newborn. But there’s something special about him – because he gives hope to thousands of women desperate to become mothers.

His parents are the first in the world to benefit from a fertility test which promises to revolutionise IVF – and could be cheap enough for widespread use on the NHS.  

The Oxford University DNA test helps fertility doctors select only the best embryos. Doing this could almost guarantee some women a baby.

Bundle of joy: Connor was conceived using the new fertility test developed at Oxford University

His mother and father, Marybeth Scheidts, 36, and David Levy, 41, had been trying to start a family for five years and feared they would never have a baby.

Then Connor was born seven weeks ago weighing 7lb 15oz.

Miss Scheidts told the Mail: ‘The first time I saw Connor, I was smashed with emotion. David and I are crazy, insanely in love with this kid.’ 

The couple, who live in Philadelphia, took part in a small-scale trial of the test which aims to increase the success rates of IVF. Currently as few as a quarter of IVF attempts lead to a birth.

The test uses cutting-edge technology
 called next generation sequencing to find out whether embryos have just
 the right number of chromosomes.  

The
 European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology’s annual 
conference heard that many eggs contain too many or too few chromosomes.

This stops any pregnancy from taking place or leads to a miscarriage. Having too many chromosomes can lead to conditions such as Down’s syndrome.

Therefore the test should also boost 
the odds of babies born by IVF being healthy. It would also cut the 
financial costs of IVF. 

Several
 tests are already available but Oxford University’s Dr Dagan Wells 
believes that his will be half the cost of its rivals. Couples face 
paying up to £15,000 per course of IVF, plus £2,000 to £3,000 for 
chromosomal testing.

The
 test can also look for genes behind rare diseases and assess the health
 of the mitochondria – the ‘batteries’ inside cells that turn the food 
we eat into energy. 

Defects in these cause around 50 genetic diseases, many of which kill in infancy or lead to miscarriages.

When all three features are taken into account, it is hoped the test will boost the odds of pregnancy by around a third. Used on relatively young women in the best clinics, it could take the odds of pregnancy to almost 80 per cent per attempt.  

It is thought that the main beneficiaries of the test will be women in their 30s. The embryos of those aged 40-plus carry more defects, so too few could be produced for the test to be used.

A large-scale trial is planned for the UK later this year which, if successful, could mean the test will be available through private clinics in as little as 18 months.  

However, some raised fears that the test could be exploited to give couples ‘designer’ babies with a certain eye or hair colour.

Roy Farquharson, of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, warned that the law would have to be amended to limit the genes that could be hunted out by the test.
