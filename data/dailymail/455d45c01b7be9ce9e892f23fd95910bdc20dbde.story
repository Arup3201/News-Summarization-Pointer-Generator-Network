A schoolboy burglar used his angelic looks to 'dupe' generous elderly people as he terrorised wealthy neighbourhoods.

The prolific criminal was just 12 years old when he joined a gang targeting vulnerable residents in some of the UK's most affluent areas.

He was used as a 'frontman', knocking on doors claiming to have lost a toy or that he needed to borrow a pencil and paper.

As he distracted kind-spirited victims, an accomplice would break in and steal as much cash and jewellery as they could carry.

This boy, 12, was used as a 'frontman' for a burglary gang targeting pensioners in London, Kent and Surrey

Police suspect they escaped with a 
haul worth tens of thousands of pounds as they targeted dozens of 
households across London, Surrey and Kent.

In
 many cases their victims were elderly or disabled, including a widow 
whose irreplaceable engagement ring – worn for more than 50 years – was 
snatched.

They were left 
terrified with some telling police they are now too scared to sleep 
without the light on. Others said they were humiliated after being taken
 in by such a young child.

At
 court, the boy – now aged 13 – was initially barred from the room by 
officials who said he was too young to be allowed inside.

Once
 they realised he was the defendant, the 5ft-tall thief, who was dressed
 in a shirt and tie, was allowed to sit at the back with a chaperone.

The boy was brought to justice after being caught on CCTV close to the scene of one burglary in Kingston, South West London, last July.

Detectives eventually linked him to 48 similar burglaries spanning the South East of England between June and September 2013.

They suspect the gang are behind many more raids as they effectively worked 'full time', racking up hundreds of miles as they searched for victims.

Accomplice Michael Doran was jailed for nine years and six months for his role in the burglary spree

In each case the boy was used to 
distract anyone who answered the door while Michael Doran, 39, ransacked
 their homes. A third burglar was used as a getaway driver.

Raids
 took place in Carlshalton and Kingston, in Surrey, Dartford in Kent, 
and across London, including Kensington, West Dulwich, Lambeth and 
Bromley.

In one case in 
Greenwich, a huge haul of precious jewellery was stolen from an 
82-year-old widow when she answered her door to the boy.

It included her blue sapphire and 
diamond engagement ring as well as gold rings and necklaces given to her
 by her husband during their life together.

Prosecutor
 Simon Sandford said: 'She was very upset. The jewellery was bought by 
her late husband and held many memories which she can never get back.'

In
 another case, a 62-year-old disabled man lost a valuable watch and £400
 cash when the boy knocked on the door of his Dartford home claiming to 
have lost his ball.

Geraldine Ward, 36, was jailed for three years after admitting acting as a driver

When he went back inside he found a man rifling through his belongings in his bedroom. He shouted at him and the pair ran off.

Ordering him to undertake a one year rehabilitation order, Judge Ruth Downing said only his youth was saving him from prison.

She said: 'The burglary of someone by knocking on their door and distracting them is a very unpleasant offence.

'It preys on people's good faith and belief that someone needs help, that they really want a glass of water, or pencil and paper or that a ball really is in their back garden.

'Then their trust is abused and their home invaded and items of real value, both emotional, sentimental and monetary, were taken.

'These were very serious offences which I regard as vile, in many ways because of the way it preyed on the people in question.

'If you had participated in them as a grown up, or even aged 17 or 18, you would be losing your liberty in this court.'

The burglar was sentenced at high-security Woolwich Crown Court after admitting conspiracy to commit burglary in relation to 10 raids.

The boy, who has spikey, jelled hair, was accompanied by two social workers, a youth offending expert, two police officers and several relatives.

He spent the one-hour hearing playing with his tie and staring at the clock, speaking only to say 'yes miss' when they judge asked if he understood.

Addressing him directly, Judge Downing said she feared the 'complicated and complex' proceedings would 'go over the top of your head.'

The sentence, which will be enforced by a local offending team, includes reparation work, counselling and weekly classes aimed at illustrating the impact of his crimes.

Earlier this month his accomplice Michael Doran was jailed for nine years and six months for his role in the burglary spree.

Doran's partner Geraldine Ward, 36, was jailed for three years after admitting acting as a driver. She also pawned the stolen jewellery for cash and withdrew cash using stolen bank cards.

Mr Sandford said vulnerable victims of the burglaries have been left reeling and upset.

He said: 'They are not comfortable in their homes and feel embarrassed that they have been taken in as a dupe by this boy. Many of them fear sleeping alone and leave the lights on at night.'

Speaking after the case, DC Kevin Seed, of the Met, said: 'These burglaries were pre-planned and this pair targeted mainly elderly residents, many with serious health and mobility issues.

'Doran and Ward ruthlessly selected their victims and the use of a young boy to commit these offences shows how they took advantage of their victim's kindness and good nature.

'The lengthy sentences they have received reflects the seriousness of the offences they carried out and shows the police nor will the courts tolerate these types of crimes.'

His colleague DC Kerry Townley added: 'We very much hope that the 13-year-old boy is rehabilitated and does not come to our notice again. We hope that he does change his life for the better.'
