Three separate bomb blasts in the Nigerian city of Maiduguri have killed at least 10 people and injured several more.

One of the explosions was caused by a suicide bomber who detonated a tricycle-taxi, according to witnesses.

A military source has said the first two explosions were from bombs - one inside a busy marketplace and the other nearby.

The wave of violent attacks which happened within half-an-hour of each other left dead bodies strewn across the ground.

Another witness heard all the three explosions from about mid-day in the city which houses over two million people.

Maiduguri is the state capital of Borno State - the heartland of militant group Boko Haram which has adopted the city as its self-declared capital. 

A member of a civilian emergency response team said: 'I have counted five ambulances that have evacuated victims
from the scene. 

'Soldiers are shooting in the air and warding off
people at the market.'

Fish-seller Idi Idrisa who was in the vicinity of the blast says several people were badly wounded.

An officer who wishes to stay anonymous says he counted 10 corpses on the ground but the death toll is mounting, with unconfirmed reports of up to 19 deaths.

The attack bears the hallmarks of terrorist group Boko Haram which has intensified suicide bombings and village attacks as soldiers from neighbouring countries try to expel the militants from towns along the Nigeria-Cameroon border.

Around 12,000 people have died since the group's deadly uprising in north-eastern Nigeria six years ago.

The extremists are reportedly amassing forces at their headquarters in the town of Gwoza to prepare for a bloody showdown with the multinational force, an intelligence officer has said.

Now the militants are warning civilians to leave the town to avoid being killed in the crossfire, a woman who has been trapped there since July has told her daughter. 

Hajiya Adama claims her mother left last week and escaped to the town of Yola in neighboring Adamawa state.

'She told me that Boko Haram terrorists asked them to leave suddenly, that they were preparing grounds for a major battle,' she said.

'While being helped by other women to leave through Madagali, they saw many Boko Haram terrorists in trucks and some on bikes moving toward Gwoza.'

An intelligence officer has said security forces are being careful for fear of harming civilians - and because Boko Haram has surrounded Gwoza with land mines.
