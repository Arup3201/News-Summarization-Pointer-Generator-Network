She's the world's most successful Duchess of Cambridge lookalike - and now she has the baby to match.

For Heidi Agan, 33, who has astounded people across the world with her similarity to the Duchess of Cambridge, has been sent a limited edition 'Polo playing' Prince George doll.

Only three have been crafted by Zapf Creations - the makers of the popular Baby Annabell doll - with one sent special delivery to the royal couple themselves.

It's unclear where the third doll has gone.

Duchess of Cambridge lookalike Heidi Agan, 33, has been sent a Prince George lookalike doll - complete with a polo pony - by the toy firm behind Baby Annabell dolls

The doll is one of only three in the world - and one of the remaining two was sent to the real Duchess of Cambridge and husband William as a baby gift

'I feel really privileged to have 
been sent a Prince George,' said Heidi who is a professional Kate 
lookalike, from Cheslyn Hay, South Staffordshire.

'It's a beautiful doll but I won't be
using it on jobs,' she laughed. 'It's way too valuable for that. I'll 
be keeping it safe instead as I think it's a real collector's item.

'I don't want it to get ruined.'

The Prince George doll looks a little older than the third in line to the throne, who was born on July 22, weighing 8lb 6oz.

Instead the replica looks just like he's following in the footsteps of his royal father.

He is seated on a fluffy horse wearing a Polo outfit, complete with a T-shirt emblazoned with a royal crest, helmet and mallet.

'It's incredible that they thought of
me. It's my four-year-old daughter, Abigail, who has been giving up her
dolls to use so it's lovely that she also has her own Prince George, 
too.

'I think it's a real blessing - 
especially knowing that Kate has one, too. I have something she owns 
and, in a letter which accompanied the doll, Zapf explain that they 
wanted Kate and I to share that bond.

'It's so special that they even 
thought to send me one. There are three in the world and I would never 
have thought to have got one. I'm a very lucky girl.'

And of the newest addition to the 
Royal Family, Heidi said: 'He's lovely. When I found out Kate was in 
labour, I sat in front of the news all day.

Only three of the dolls were crafted by Zapf Creations, and one was sent special delivery to the Royal couple themselves

She looked fantastic when she came 
out and showing off her bump has demonstrated to people you don't have 
to be scared of your post-pregnancy body. Everyone is used to seeing 
slimmed down celebrities, but what she did was great.

'I was also impressed with the way 
they handled the world's press. The last thing I wanted to do after 
having my two children was talk to anyone.'

Heidi added that she'll be interested to see what effect Prince George has on the fashion world, too.
'I would like to see if he follows in the footsteps of his mum,' she said.

'I wonder if anything he's seen wearing will be an instant sell-out just like the effect Kate has on clothing.'

Heidi, who also has an 11-year-old son, Blake, has already been out and about on jobs, with real and replica babies.

People really believe that you're Kate having a stroll around the park with Prince George. It's quite funny,' she laughed.

'I
won't be using it on jobs,' Heidi said. 'It is way too valuable for 
that. I'll be keeping it safe instead as I think it's a real collector's
item'
