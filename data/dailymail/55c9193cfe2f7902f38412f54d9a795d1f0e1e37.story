Injured: Alleged bomb-maker Martin Middleton has lost fingers in an incident at home on Sunday

A bungling bomb maker blew off part of his hand when a home-made explosive went off at his house. 

Martin Middleton is in hospital being treated for his injuries while under police arrest.

It is thought the 26-year-old, who is in a ‘stable’ condition, has lost several fingers following the incident on Sunday.

Mr Middleton had apparently been making a pipebomb, although police, who are waiting to interview to him, are unsure why.

Up to 40 homes had to be evacuated following the explosion in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

Neighbours were today shocked to hear about the explosion, which could have had lethal consequences.

Mr Middleton is soon to become a father after his girlfriend Kay Emerson fell pregnant.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'I couldn’t believe when I heard, it’s like something out of a movie.

'His girlfriend is pregnant, I thought he was getting his life back on track.'

Another, who also wanted to remain anonymous, added: 'I see him now an again, he looks like a nice enough lad, he always says hello.

'Shocking to hear that.'

Police searched two other properties in the Tonge Moor area of Bolton as part of the investigation but no explosive items were found.

Officers went to a house a few doors away, which is thought to be where Mr Middleton’s mother lives. He had recently moved to the same street with his girlfriend.

Mr Middleton’s injury is described as a ‘serious hand injury’ but it is not life threatening, although it is believed he has lost some of his fingers.

Detective Chief Inspector Sarah Jackson, said: 'I appreciate that given the nature of this incident and the impact it had, that there will be some concern among residents, but I want to reiterate that this was an isolated incident and there was not and is not any threat to the wider community.

'We are continuing to investigate the circumstances leading up to this incident and if anyone has any information that can assist I would urge them to get in touch.'

Mudasir Dean, ward councillor for Bradshaw, said: 'I am sure the police will get to the bottom of this.

'We must find out why this bomb was built. The consequences could have been devastating if a more sizable device would have detonated in this residential area.'

Mr Middleton has been arrested on suspicion of causing an explosion likely to endanger life or property.
