Dylan Hartley says Northampton's England contingent will depart for international duty content that Saints are still chasing silverware on three fronts.

A 34-6 demolition of previously unbeaten Guinness PRO12 leaders the Ospreys at Franklin's Gardens on Saturday has kept alive hopes of progressing to the knockout stage of the Champions Cup.

On the domestic front, the defence of their Aviva Premiership title has begun by claiming first place after six rounds ahead of the break for LV= Cup action.

Northampton supply seven of England's 33-man squad named for the QBE Series against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia, and Hartley reckons they can reflect on a satisfying start to the season.

'We're sitting at the top of the Premiership - which is nice - and our European campaign is still alive. We're in a good place,' Hartley said.

'We've got two weeks of the LV now and we've got some boys champing at the bit, some young players ready for a game.'

One of those certain to start against New Zealand at Twickenham in a fortnight is Tom Wood, the blindside flanker who demonstrated his commitment to Saints by opting to play against the Ospreys over attending the birth of his third child.

'Tom Wood's nose looks pretty b*****ed after that match!' Hartley said.

'His wife was in hospital expecting a child while the game was on, but he insisted on playing.

'His nose was spread across his face and he then ran to the hospital!

'Other than that, all the boys are in good nick and we're excited - it's a big series coming up and a huge game against the All Blacks to start it with.'

Wales wing George North plundered four tries, the last of which was a stunning solo effort, to fire Northampton to an important bonus-point victory a week after they had left Racing Metro empty-handed.

A draw and then bonus point slipped from their grasp in Paris and Hartley admits the last of North's four-try salvo was vital.

'I was a bit worried towards the end there because, after not picking up something last week, five points was crucial for us against the Ospreys,' Hartley said.

'We had so many chances and the game was fully in our hands for 80 minutes. I was worried, but we got there in the end. George North saved the day.'
