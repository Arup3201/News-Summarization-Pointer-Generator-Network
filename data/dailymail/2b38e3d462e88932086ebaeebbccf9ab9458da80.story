Celebrated architect Cesar Pelli, known for designing some of the world's tallest buildings, has unveiled his latest designs for the 1.5-million-square-foot Transbay Transit Center in San Francisco, California.

A new video rendering shows the massive shimmering structure with a 5.4-acre rooftop park, shopping outlets and multiple cyclist and pedestrian passageways lined with greenery.

The developers have compared the $4.2 billion project to Grand Central Station in New York City and Victoria Station in London.

Their transit hub will have a few extra amenities, such as the rooftop park designed by Berkeley-based PWP Landscape Architecture, which will be lined with playgrounds and cafes as well as an amphitheater.

The above-ground park will be built around three large skylights, which will descend several floors to bring natural light to the underground level of the hub, where BART trains will begin making stops in 2017.

The completed hub will replace the current Transbay Terminal at First and Mission streets in San Francisco with a transit center connecting eight Bay Area counties and other parts of California through 11 transit systems, including AC Transit, BART and three city blocks of bus depots.

The transit hub will also house a 1,000-foot office tower, which will become the city’s tallest building when construction is completed in 2017.

Construction on the Transbay project began in August 2010. Since then assessments for risk and vulnerability using federal guidelines have created a few setbacks for the developers, Transbay Joint Powers Authority, and Pelli’s architecture firm, Pelli Clarke Pelli, according to the San Francisco Examiner.

A late 2011 assessment found that any glass used on the outside of the structure would have to be significantly strengthened to meet the guidelines, including blast safety in explosions.

Authority officials have asked the project’s board of directors to approve studying the use of a perforated metal material instead of glass.

If approved, that could end up saving about $17.5 million on material and construction costs, according to the Examiner.

As it can be seen now, the design for the new transit center ‘drips with sex appeal, featuring gorgeous architecture with sinuous curves, enriched paving, lush landscaping, and seductive water displays,’ urban designer and writer Darrin Nordahl  wrote when an early set of renderings were shown last year.
