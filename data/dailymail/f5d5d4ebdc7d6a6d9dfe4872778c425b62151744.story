Justin Bieber's people have said that despite their superstar client agreeing to take a paternity test to prove whether he is the father of Mariah Yeater's baby, her people have failed to contact them and that she is 'avoiding' comparing the DNA samples.

Not so, her camp says. Lawyers for Miss Yeater say that they have repeatedly contacted Bieber's lawyers and that she can't wait to match Bieber's DNA with her baby Tristyn's.

Speaking to TMZ, Yeater's attorney Jefferey Leving says he was in touch with Bieber's lawyer Howard Weitzman twice last week.

No
contact: Mariah Yeater, who gave an interview to TV show The Insider in
which she claimed Justin Bieber is the father of her baby Tristyn

He also expressed concern that he was not present when Bieber provided his DNA sample.

Leving argues that they are not convinced that the proper controls were used during the test in New Jersey last week.

Last night Bieber once again protested 
his innocence, telling Letterman: 'I mean I could smell a weasel. People
make up false accusations.'

The singer went on: 'I am 17, but it is going to happen….Being in the spotlight.  I took it. They just swab your mouth.'

Yesterday he looked pretty relaxed and confident about the test as he stepped out with girlfriend Selena Gomez.

The young couple went out for a bite to eat at IHOP in Los Angeles.

Justin showed off his unique dress sense, wearing a hooded top, denim waistcoat, beanie hat, yellow jeans and floral pattered grey-blue trainers.

TMZ reported that Bieber took the DNA test on Friday  under 'very controlled circumstances.'

This means it will be hard for Yeater and her legal team to challenge the results.

It is now up to her to provide DNA results from her son.

Yeater has dropped her lawsuit against the teen star although her lawyer has claimed they plan to pursue the matter privately.

However
Bieber has no intention of giving her any form of settlement, and has 
previously said he was willing to take the test to end the speculation.

He said: 'All this stuff is dealt with by my legal team. But if they want me to (take a paternity test) then I will.'
