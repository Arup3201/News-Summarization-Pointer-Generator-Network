Talent: Vanessa Mae has sold more than 10million records and was the youngest soloist ever to record the demanding Beethoven and Tchaikovsky violin concertos when she was 13

As if being an internationally renowned violinist wasn’t enough, Vanessa Mae has added another string to her bow.

The 35-year-old British star has been selected to ski in the Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia next month.

Miss Mae is putting her musical career on ice for a year to compete for Thailand, where her father was born.

Her place is expected to be confirmed today after she took part in a series of trials in Slovenia.

Mae, an avid skier since childhood, has been competing as Vanessa Vanakorn, adopting her father's surname.

And over the weekend, the child music prodigy completed four grueling races in a last-ditch bid to qualify for the event.

Mae, who has sold more than 10 million records worldwide, said: 'I'm British but realistically there 
is no way I could represent my own country, but because my natural 
father is Thai, they have accepted me.'

Manager
 Giles Holland, speaking on behalf of Mae, told the BBC: 'It would 
appear that she's done it. She's done it by a whisker, but she's done 
it.'

'Vanessa Mae has 
unofficially qualified for the Olympic Games, that I could say to you,' 
added Marko Rudolf, a Slovenian master skier with links to the 
committee that organised the races.

Under
 current Olympic qualification rules, countries with no skier ranked in 
the world's top 500 may send one man and one woman to the Games - to 
compete in slalom and giant slalom - if those athletes meet a second set
 of criteria.

Thailand has no skiers ranked in the 
world's top 500 for any Alpine discipline. To meet the second criteria, 
Mae had to produce an average of 140 points or fewer over five 
recognised races.

Under skiing's system of ranking, the fewer points an athlete has, the better they are.

Qualified: She raced four times in Slovenia at the weekend in a last-ditch bid to meet the qualifying standard

Mae scraped through over the weekend, dipping under the 140-mark average thanks to strong results in a series of four back-to-back giant slalom races in Slovenia.

The 5ft 3in 35-year-old was even forced to race in a national junior championships, in which she was more than 14 years older than any other entrant, as time ran out.

The world governing body must still confirm Mae's place at the Games when the final points lists are published on Monday.

Mae has spoken previously of her ambition to compete at the Winter Games.

She announced her bid to qualify for Sochi 2014 as early as mid-2010, telling the Daily Telegraph: 'It has been my dream and I am hoping people will accept I just want to give it my best.

'To even get to the Olympics, I have to qualify for the 2013 World Championships and the standard is high.

'I am taking a plunge. I am British, but realistically there is no way I could represent my own country.

'But because my natural father is Thai, they have accepted me.'

Love of the slope: Mae has been skiing since she was a child

In the latest rankings, Mae is 3,166 in the world in giant slalom. 

Vanessa Mae started playing the piano at three and the violin at five. Aged just ten, she made her solo debut with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London at the Royal Festival Hall.

She was the youngest soloist ever to record the demanding Beethoven and Tchaikovsky violin concertos when she was 13.

She was the girl who bridged the classical/popular music divide and became an overnight sensation when pictures of her rising provocatively out of the sea, her diaphanous dress clinging to her wet body, were used on the cover of her first single.

Her record sales have reached ten million copies worldwide.

And in 2006, the Sunday Times rich list ranked her as the wealthiest entertainer aged under 30, with an estimated fortune of £32 million. Today her wealth is nearer £40 million.
