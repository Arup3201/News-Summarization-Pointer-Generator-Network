After decades of male dominance, women are finally making in-roads as racing car drivers.

This July, Susie Wolff will be the first woman to take part in a Formula 1 Grand Prix for 22 years as she will test drive cars in her role as a development driver for Williams Martini Racing.

And now another female driver is making history as it has been announced that British born Katherine Legge has been selected as a driver for Amlin's Formula E motor racing team.

Driving force: Katherine Legge has been selected as a driver for Amlin's Formula E motor racing team

Fast female: The 33-year-old said she's looking forward to speeding through the streets

Katherine, 33, from Surrey, is the first female driver in the Formula E Championship, a new initiative from the FIA which was established in 2012. 

She said: 'For me this is a really exciting opportunity. The car is fantastic, it looks amazing and it will be very quick.

'Racing through the streets of the world's leading cities will be an incredible experience and I think it's a great chance to bring racing to the people. We will be driving in their cities on their streets.'

The Formula E cars look similar to their Formula 1 cousins but the engine, power train and power supply are unique. 

Driven: Katherine is an experienced IndyCar racer

New series: The Formula E cars look similar to their Formula 1 cousins but are electric

Formula E cars accelerate from 0-100km/h in under three seconds and will reach speeds of up to 225km/h. The fundamental difference is that these cars are powered by a battery and represent the cutting edge of electric vehicle technology.

The research and development supporting the Championship has the potential to radically change transport systems around the world, particularly in urban areas, where air pollution caused by fossil fuels is a serious concern.    

Serious about winning: Katherine has raced in several developmental open-wheel series in Britain, including Formula Three, Formula Renault and Formula Ford

Cutting edge technology: Formula E cars accelerate from 0-100km/h in under three seconds and will reach speeds of up to 225km/h

Amlin's team, based in Donnington, are led by team principal Mark Preston and are currently preparing for their first race in this new Championship, which will begin in Beijing on 13th September.

'Formula E will be a very exciting and demanding Championship and I think it brings an interesting new dimension to the sport. This is as much about strategy as it is about driving fast - it's playing Chess at 220 km/h, said Mark.

CEO of Amlin, Charles Philipps, said he was 'very excited' about the championship and said Katherine has been selected to drive as a a serious podium contender.

He said: 'We are serious about racing and serious about winning.'

Katherine has been race car driving for years and is a seasoned competitor in the IndyCar series in the U.S.

She has raced in several developmental open-wheel series in Britain, including Formula Three, Formula Renault and Formula Ford.

In
 2005 she was given RACER Magazine's 'Most Promising Road Racer of The 
Year' award - previous winners include Kimi Räikkönen, Jenson Button and
 Cristiano da Matta.

So could Katharine's career in Formula E lead to become a champion of Formula 1?

She has already been behind the wheel of an F1 car having test driven for the Minardi team at Vallelunga near Rome in 2005.

Another Brit making history: Susie Wolff is a development driver for the Williams F1 team and will take part in July's Silverstone Grand Prix

One of the team: Susie with her teammates Valtteri Bottas, Felipe Massa and Felipe Nasr

But as Susie Wolff has discovered, breaking into F1 driving isn't easy.

Many doubt whether women are physically capable of dealing with the G-forces encountered when F1 driving while former British racing driver Sir Stirling Moss told the BBC in April that he doesn't think women have the 'mental aptitude to race hard, wheel-to-wheel.'

Women like Susie and Katherine inevitably have to deal with sexism in the male dominated sport.

'I've lost count of the amount of times I've been asked, "Do you have a lipstick holder in your car?",' Susie told the Daily Express last week.

She added: 'It's got easier to deal with over time. There will always be comments no matter what you do. You'll always have those that are for you and those that are against you... It's hard for their (men's) egos to cope with a girl beating them.'

But with more women taking to the track, men might have to start getting used to it.
