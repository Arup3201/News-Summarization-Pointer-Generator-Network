A Florida man accused of having sex with a miniature donkey in his care claims that state laws forbidding him from doing so are are a violation of his constitutional rights.

Carlos R. Romero, 32, of Ocala, was arrested on September 14 
and charged with engaging in sexual activity involving an animal and 
animal cruelty after police said he had sex with Doodle, a two-year-old miniature donkey in his care.

But before his trial, Romero's lawyers have filed a measure in court urging a judge to declare the state laws forbidding sex with animals unconstitutional.

Busted: Attorneys for farmhand Carlos Romero are arguing that Florida's laws prohibiting sex with animals are a violation of his constitutional rights

The motion argues that the law encroaches on Romero's due process rights, according to the Ocala Star-Banner.

The paper reported that the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which was the basis for the landmark Brown v. Board of Education case, has been violated in Romero's case.

The motion was filed on December 6.

Romero was taken into custody at the Ocala farm where he was employed after reportedly admitting to police that he becomes aroused when seeing animals in heat and mating.

When interviewed by police, Romero described in graphic detail his sexual encounter with Doodle, saying that he likes how the critter's fur feels against his privates, according to the police report obtained by The Smoking Gun.

He went on to say that he 'may have come in contact with the donkey' by accident and left his DNA - also 'by accident.'

Romero also admitted that he masturbated with Doodle five or six times, but said he did not have sex with the critter because 'she's blooming into maturity,'Â the Star-Banner reported.

He added, according to the arrest report, that Florida is a 'backwards' state and 'people frown on zoophilia here.'

The alleged incident that landed Romero behind bars took place on August 15, when Gerald James, who rents the farm in the 9100 block of NW 60th Avenue arrived at around 9:30pm to deliver a horse.

James told police that all the farm buildings were shrouded in darkness, but there was light in the tac room.

Through the window, James said he saw Romero 'up against the rear of the donkey' with his shirt off and his pants down and was apparently having sex with the animal.

He said Romero pulled away from the 21-month-old animal after he saw James looking at him. He then pushed Doodle out the room and closed the door behind her.

Romero was booked into the Marion County Jail on $2,000 bond. The miniature donkey was taken away by animal control officials.

Since his arrest, Romero has spoken out about the incident, demanding that Doodle - which he claims he paid $500 for - be returned to him.

A custody hearing for Doodle has been delayed twice, and is now slated for December 21, according to the Star-Banner.
