A baby was born on the bathroom floor of his parents’ home just two hours after midwives sent them home from hospital.

William Jones had to be delivered by his father after his mother Vanessa was told by maternity unit staff she was 'only in the early stages' of labour.

The birth occurred shortly after she and husband Billy were turned away from the delivery suite at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Lancashire - despite Mr Jones making a video of her having her contractions and in obvious pain inside the maternity unit.

Mr Jones, 41, a joiner, from Warton, near Preston, said: 'It is amazing and an honour to deliver my baby boy - not every husband gets to do that - but the fact is we do feel let down by the hospital.

Healthy: 8lb William was born with the umbilical cord around his neck, which his father had to untangle

'William should have been born the safe environment of a maternity unit - not on my bathroom floor where they were obvious dangers.

When he came out he was born with the umbilical cord around his neck and I had to untangle it and obviously I was very worried in case he couldn’t breathe. It was only when he cried that I could breathe a massive sigh of relief.

'I am so annoyed and concerned for other expecting parents visiting that hospital - could you imagine what that experience could do to first-time parents - it would destroy them and could put them off having other children.

'We were in shock a few days after it happened because it all could have gone horribly wrong.'

Mrs Jones's waters broke on Wednesday April 2 and when she began suffering contractions, the couple headed to hospital.

Mrs Jones, 33, a telesales worker, has two older sons.

Mr Jones added: 'Vanessa knew she was going into labour and I thought it was pretty obvious she was too - we’re experienced with pregnancies, especially since she’s already given birth to her two sons and I’ve also got four children from a previous relationship.

'But they sent us away saying the baby wasn’t imminent and told us to go home and get some sleep.

'We were very surprised at the time, but you put your faith in the professionals and we followed their advice from the hospital and they went back home to bed to try and get some sleep.

'I drifted off to sleep but Vanessa was still suffering pain so must have got up. She said she was sat in the bathroom for around an hour and ran herself a bath. But the baby was coming - she yelled and screamed at me, "the heads here".

'I woke up and was thrown into the surreal situation. In a panic I phoned the hospital and it took around eight attempts to get hold of the midwife.

She advised Vanessa not to go into the bath, so Vanessa got down on her knees on the bathroom floor.

'I screamed ‘Help us the baby is coming’ - she finally realised William was coming then and there.'

Billy
said Vanessa’s sons, Jack, 8, and Kyle, 9, along with his 18-year-old 
daughter Katie, who lived with them, woke up to the most awful scene.

William was born weighing eight pounds.

The unexpected birth occurred jut two hours after Mr and Mrs Jones were turned away from the delivery suite at Blackpool Victoria Hospital

He said: 'They woke up to her screaming "the head’s here", and I didn’t know what to do.

'We were on the phone to the delivery suite, which sent for an ambulance, but I had the baby in my hands by the time the paramedics got here.

'It was just so surreal how it all happened - Vanessa made me watch One Born Every Minute a few times, but it made me so squeamish.

'had no idea how to deliver a baby so to be put in that position was terrifying.

'We are just so relieved William was 
breathing because otherwise, he could have died. It took paramedics 
around 25 minutes to arrive after he was born, so anything could have 
happened.'

Mrs Jones said: 
'I knew I was in labour, but they said I wasn’t. They didn’t give me any
pain relief and told me to go home and get some sleep.

Mr Jones said: 'It is amazing and an honour to deliver my baby boy - not every husband gets to do that - but the fact is, we do feel let down by the hospital'

It took paramedics around 25 minutes to arrive after William was born. Staff at Blackpool Royal Infirmary (pictured) said it was not always possible to predict the speed of established labour

'I could hardly move in the car coming home, and an hour and a half later I was in full blown labour. Luckily William was fine, but it could have been totally different if he came out not breathing. That upsets me more than anything.'

Head of midwifery at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Nicola Parry, said: 'We are sorry to hear that Mrs Jones was unhappy with the quality of care she received at Blackpool Victoria Hospital. 

'It is normal practice for midwives to encourage patients who are in the early stages of labour to go home, but to keep in touch with the hospital, letting us know if there has been any changes in what they are experiencing, such as their contractions becoming stronger, their waters breaking or if they have any blood loss or concerns.

'They can come back in to the hospital at any time, even if they have just returned home, if they start experiencing the symptoms of active labour.

'We cannot comment on Mrs Jones case because of patient confidentiality, but will meet with her to discuss in full any concerns she and her family have, taking forward any lessons learned from that meeting.'
