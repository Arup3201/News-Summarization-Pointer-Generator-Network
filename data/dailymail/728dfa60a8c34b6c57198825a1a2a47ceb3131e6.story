Taxing: David Cameron is struggling to win over British territories and Crown dependencies to his plan to crackdown n tax havens

David Cameron’s global crackdown on tax avoidance could be jettisoned by Bermuda.

The Prime Minister had hoped to secure a major agreement with tax havens suspected of allowing the mega-rich to hide their wealth from the UK taxman.

But Bermuda is so far refusing to sign up to the transparency deal ahead of next week’s G8 summit.

Mr Cameron hoped to use a meeting with 10 British overseas territories and crown dependencies as proof he is cracking down on the ‘scourge of tax evasion’ which costs Britain billions.

Senior ministers from Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man are expected to attend the summit in London on Saturday.

But Bermuda's Premier Craig Cannonier has signalled he will not sign up to the deal, raising the prospect of other territories refusing to take part.

Mr Cameron has made the tax avoidance and evasion a priority of the G8 summit which he is hosting in Northern Ireland on June 17 and 18.

He has warned overseas territories of the need to ‘get our own houses in order’. Some of the islands and outposts are widely regarded as offshore tax havens, though they dispute this description and regard their low-tax regimes as vital to their economies.

Mr Cameron wants them all to sign up to the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, which includes keeping a list owners of companies which can then be checked by tax authorities from around the world.

However, Bermuda claims it already meets many of the provisions and is not ready to commit to signing the convention.

Premier Mr Cannonier told Reuters: ‘There's some clauses in there that we need to look at, that may need to be adjusted, and ... our finance ministry is going over it with a fine-tooth comb.’

He also questioned whether Mr Cameron will be able to achieve broad agreement from all the territories this week.

However, a spokesman for the Cayman Islands government said it has already agreed to commit to the Convention.

Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man have also signalled that they are ready to sign the OECD convention.

Mr Cameron yesterday insisted he could secure ‘further progress’ with overseas territories at this weekend’s meeting.

He added: ‘People rightly get angry when they work hard, they pay their taxes and then see others not paying their fair share.

‘But in a globalised world, no one country can on their own effectively stamp out either tax evasion or aggressive tax avoidance and this is exactly the sort of issue that the leaders of the eight major economies should address. We should be galvanising international action.’

Clash: Mr Cameron hopes to persuade the leaders of the world's biggest economies to sign up to new tax rules but ahead of the G8 summit there have been protests in London

Pressure is mounting on Mr Cameron to secure a landmark agreement on tax at the G8 summit with the leaders of the world's largest economies in Co Fermagh at the Lough Erne golf resort.

There have already been angry anti-capitalist protests in London, and campaigners have warned the Prime Minister risks failing to live up to his rhetoric.

Last month he wrote to the British overseas territories warning them that he had made ‘fighting the scourge of tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance’ a priority for the G8 summit.

He added: ‘I am looking to all the overseas territories and crown dependencies to continue to work in partnership with the UK in taking the lead on two critical issues: tax information exchange and beneficial ownership.

‘I respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions. I believe passionately in lower taxes as a vital driver of growth and prosperity for all.

‘But lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid - and if the rules to achieve this are set and enforced fairly to create a level playing field right across the world.

‘There is no point in dealing with tax evasion in one country if the problem is simply displaced to another.''

He has hailed a breakthrough in talks to secure an Europe-wide deal on sharing information to stop multi-national firms avoiding paying tax.

The Prime Minister said European Union agreement had been reached on tackling tax evasion and avoidance, after warning countries face 'staggering' losses.
