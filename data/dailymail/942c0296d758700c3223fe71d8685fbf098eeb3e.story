To many of us, broken household items are just junk, but to one designer this trash can be transformed into delicate robotic sculptures.

Inspired by images from science fiction films, California photographer Larry Wong has designed a range of futuristic miniature droids called Mechanoids.

From insects to drones, his electronic figures are all compiled from a collection of broken, everyday items.

Inspired by images from science fiction films, California photographer Larry Wong has designed a range of robotic sculptures called Mechanoids. Each of his electronic figures is made up of old household, everyday electrical items. This humanoid features a motor for a head, and parts of a hard drive for arms

Many of Wong's designs were based on the work of Swiss artist and set designer H.R. Giger.

Giger was part of the special effects team that won an award for the design of the 1979 science fiction film Alien.

He is famous for artwork that represents the human body and machines in a 'cold interconnected relatonship'.

Giger calls this relationship 'biomechanical'.

These include parts taken from broken VCRs, DVD drives, hard drives, power supplies and plugs and vacuum tubes.

Each Mechanoid is then fitted together using copper, steel and aluminum wires.

Wong also uses everyday tools, such as pliers and screwdrivers, to build his creatures.

The 38-year-old graphic designer and photographer from Pomona, California said his designs developed out of a fascination for electronics.

'I take junk that would otherwise go into a landfill
 and turn it into art,' explained Wong.

â€˜Looking at [the electronic] parts, I could see that some could possibly be an arm, leg or head for a robot.

As well as humanoids, photographer Larry Wong, 38, also makes robotic sculptures designed to look like insects, like the one pictured. He said the intricate parts of many electronic items resemble the delicate arms and legs of spiders and other creatures

This robotic sculpture was designed to look like a drone. It's base is made from a disc drive, while the arms are attached with fuses and copper wire

Wong said his designs developed out of a fascination for electronics. Each sculpture takes up to six hours to complete, and the designer said the most time-consuming job is finding the right part for each leg, head or body from this tool kit, pictured

'After making my first robot, I was pleased with the way it turned out, so I continued making more.'

Wong's Mechanoids range from between four and six inches in size, and because of this minature design, Wong admitted the construction can be fiddly and time-consuming.

Complicated humanoids, or more detailed creatures, can take up to six hours to complete, for example.

Yet the most time-consuming job is finding the right part for each leg, head or body.

The wings of the robotic insect, left, were made from wire bent into shape. The body is made using part of a laser drive, taken from a broken DVD or hard drive. Wong gets other parts from broken VCRs, power supplies and plugs, and vacuum tubes. The simple octopus design, right, is made from a light casing and motor

'I reject parts if I don't like their shape, colour, material or how it would look on the robot.

'Proportion is very important to me; every part needs to be just the right shape and size.

'Some people don't understand what they're looking at while others wonder about its functionality, whether it does anything.

'Techies particularly enjoy this, I ask them to see how many parts they recognise and figure out where the parts came from.'

Each Mechanoid, including this sculpture that looks like an anglerfish, is between four and six inches in size, and because of this miniature design, Wong said the construction can be fiddly and time-consuming

Wong said that proportion is key when designing Mechanoids, especially the more complex humanoid designs pictured. He added that he will regularly reject parts if they're the wrong shape, colour or size

Many of Wong's designs, including these fly-shaped sculptures pictured, were based on the work of Swiss artist and set designer H.R. Giger. Giger was part of the special effects team that won an award for the design of the 1979 science fiction film Alien

Wong has so far created 20 of his own unique sculptures.
