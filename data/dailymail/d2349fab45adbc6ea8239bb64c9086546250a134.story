Support for independence has dramatically stalled in a major boost for the union just seven days before next week's historic referendum - as women, pensioners and students unite against separation.

First Minister Alex Salmond showed signs of pressure getting to him today, as Lloyds Bank and even Royal Bank of Scotland threatened to quit an independent Scotland while John Lewis warned it would push up prices for customers.

The latest opinion poll puts the No camp six points ahead, but revealed major regional splits over independence - with support for the Union holding up in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lothian and Fife but falling away in formerly strong Labour areas in central and west Scotland.

Scots under 24 and over 65 are also forging an unlikely alliance against independence, while middle-aged men are most likely to be in favour of breakaway.

Most parts of Scotland are planning to vote against independence - but the central belt between Edinburgh and Glasgow is strongly pro-independence

Middle aged Scots are most likely to back independence, while pensioners and the young are in favour of the union

Scottish women are also much less likely to vote for independence than men, according to last night's Survation poll 

Support for independence was trailing way behind in the polls last month but dramatically surged in September. The 'Yes' campaign took the lead in the polls on Sunday, but has since fallen back and is now six points adrift of the 'No' campaign

The new poll, for the Daily Record newspaper, is a major blow to the SNP leader Mr Salmond who claimed that Scottish voters were turning their backs on the Union.

Putting a brave face on the result, Mr Salmond told a briefing for international journalists that 'Scotland is on the cusp of making history'. 

He added: 'The eyes of the world are upon Scotland. And what the world is seeing is an articulate, peaceful, energised debate.

'Scotland will vote Yes next Thursday and they will vote Yes because last minute, cobbled up promises from the No campaign which unravel at the slightest scrutiny will not fool anyone in this country and neither will the blatant bullying and intimidation of the Westminster Government.

'The No campaign is in terminal decline. In contrast a Yes vote is the opportunity of a lifetime. An opportunity to build a fairer more prosperous country.' 

But according to the Survation survey – conducted over the past week – momentum has  swung back in favour of the 'No' campaign – with just 47 per cent of Scots now planning to vote for separation.

Including voters who have yet to have make up their mind, some 47.6 per cent of Scots said they would vote 'No' if the referendum was held today. Just 42.4 per cent said they would opt for separation. But one in 10 Scots remain undecided.

The revelation will add fuel to claims that  Mr Salmond suffered a 'Black Wednesday' in his campaign for independence yesterday.

Nearly 4.3million people have registered to vote in next week's Scottish independence referendum - 97 per cent of those eligible.

The referendum is set to be the biggest poll in Scotland's history, with more people registered to vote than ever before.

Registration figures were released today as a new opinion poll gave the 'No' campaign a slim lead, following a barrage of bad news for First Minister Alex Salmond. 

The latest poll suggested that 53 per cent of Scots opposed independence with 47 per cent in favour, excluding those who have yet to make up their minds.

The total number of people who have registered for next Thursday's referendum is 4,285,323, more than for any previous election or referendum in Scotland, according to the vote's 'chief counting officer'.

Nearly 800,000 of those applied for a postal ballot - meaning they are likely to have already cast their vote.

Official statistics released this year indicated that the total population of Scotland is around 5.33million, with 4.42million of those aged at least 16 - the minimum age to vote in the referendum.

That means that just over 97 per cent of eligible voters have signed up to cast a ballot next week. 

Mr Salmond had already been hit by the news that two major businesses had publicly warned against  separation. 

And last night Lloyds bank and RBS both revealed they would move parts of their business to England in the event of a Yes vote.

Edinburgh-based financial giant Standard Life – which employs 5,000 people in Scotland - revealed it was putting in place plans to move parts of its business to England to protect itself against independence.

It came as Britain's biggest fuel company BP warned against voting 'Yes' next week. It released a statement saying the prospects for North Sea oil were best served by the UK.

Today the John Lewis Partnership has issued a warning that shoppers in Scotland are likely to face higher prices if the country goes it alone.

Chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said it had no plans to reduce its commercial presence north of the border, where it has nine shops, a contact centre and employs more than 3,000 people. 

And supermarket giant Asda warned independence would have 'cost implications' for its customers. 

Meanwhile, Gordon Brown has threatened to stand for election to the Scottish Parliament over Alex Salmond’s ‘lies’ about the NHS.

The former Prime Minister said he would make a dramatic return to frontline politics north of the border to tackle the SNP head on.

The former Prime Minister, who is still an MP in Westminster, said: ‘I say this to Mr Salmond himself. If he continues to pedal this deception then I will want to join Johann Lamont in fighting him and securing the return of a Labour Government as quickly as possible.’

Mr Brown’s surprise threat came as he launched a bid to shore up support for the Union among Scottish pensioners.

Mr Brown said Labour would not devolve Scottish pensions to Edinburgh – because they were safer under the protection of the UK Government.

But he said Mr Salmond’s claim that the NHS was in danger from London were bogus because the health service was already controlled by Holyrood.

Mr Brown also vowed to hand further tax raising powers for the Scottish Government to increase funding for the health service.

He added that if Mr Salmond continued to claim that Labour was a threat to the NHS he would stand for office in Scotland.

The revelation that Mr Brown was prepared to move his political career to Edinburgh overshadowed his pitch to pensioners to vote against independence.

Campaigners from both sides have stepped up their presence on the streets of Scotland with just a week until polling day

Better Together leader Alistair Darling highlighted the warnings from businesses as tempers flared during a fiery Mumsnet debate yesterday afternoon.

During the online question and answer session the former Chancellor accused Mr Salmond of being 'despicable', 'mad' and focused on 'throwing stones' at the English.

He also accused the SNP of trying to frighten the sick and the elderly into voting for independence by raising bogus fears over the future of the NHS. He said this was 'despicable'.

And he claimed Scotland got a 'very good deal' from being in the UK. He said the partnership between England and Scotland 'works well for both sides', adding: 'We should work with our neighbours not throw stones at them'.

Mr Darling's inflammatory comments risk fuelling accusations that the 'No' campaign was panicking amid a surge in support for independence.

Mr Salmond said the visit to Scotland of the Prime Minister, leader of the opposition and Deputy Prime Minister proved 'team Westminster' was 'coming apart at the seams'.

But Mr Cameron urged Scots not to use the referendum to give the 'effing Tories' a kicking, as Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg flew into Scotland to join the fight to preserve the Union.

David Cameron yesterday pleaded with Scottish voters not to use the independence referendum to give the 'effing Tories' a kicking.

In an extraordinary intervention, the Prime Minister appeared close to tears during a speech in Edinburgh in which he acknowledged the unpopularity of the Conservatives in Scotland but warned the result of next week's vote will stand for 100 years.

Mr Cameron cleared his diary to travel to Scotland, after polls showed the Yes and No camps are neck-and neck with barely a week until the historic referendum on Thursday September 18.

In a highly-charged speech, Mr Cameron urged voters not to use the referendum to punish unpopular Westminster parties.

The PM said: 'Because it is an election people think it's like a general election. If you are fed up with the effing Tories, you can give them a kick and then maybe we'll think again. This is totally different.

'This is not a decision about the next five years, but the next century.'

Mr Cameron went on: 'This vote is not about whether Scotland is a nation or not, Scotland is a nation, it's a strong, proud nation with an extraordinary history and incredibly talented people.

'But it is a nation that has chosen over the last 300 years to be part of a family of nations. A family of nations that enables this great country to punch way above its weight in the world.

'This vote is not about Scotland versus Britain it's about two competing visions for Scotland.

'I hope you choose the vision of Scotland that is about Scottish pride, Scottish patriotism, Scottish nationhood, but is also about being part of the family of nations we have created.'
