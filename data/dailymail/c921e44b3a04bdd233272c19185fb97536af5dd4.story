Two Thai Badminton players have been disqualified at the Canada Open after bad blood between former doubles partners ended in a punch up on the court in front of horrified spectators.

Video from the tournament shows Bodin Issara chasing his compatriot Maneepong Jongjit onto a neighboring court during a change of ends in the men's doubles finals.

The pair were facing each other during the tournament in Canada, though they had previously been teammates and played together during the London 2012 Olympics.

Farce! Thailand's Bodin Issara chases after his former doubles partner Maneepong Jongjit

Maneepong Jongjit (in the yellow) jumped over a barrier onto another court in an attempt to escape furious former partner Bodin Issara

Sprint: The pair both run in front of the stunned audience

Chase: The pursuit continues with the pair ducking under the net

Issara can be seen knocking Jongit over and punching him repeatedly on a video taken from the stands and posted on YouTube.

Issara then stands and appears to kick Jongit while he writhes on the ground.

Officials can be seen quickly rushing over and hold Issara to the ground. Jongit manages to wriggle free from the scrum - losing his jersey in the process.

He does not appear to be badly injured and walks away.

Issara, meanwhile, is pinned to the ground by a badminton official.Â 

The pair had been warned by the referee following a verbal exchange earlier in the match.

Issara and his partner Vilailak Pakkawat were promptly disqualified, with Jongjit and Nipitphon Puangpuapech awarded victory.

A
statement from the world governing body read: 'The Badminton World 
Federation is aware of an incident which occurred during the finals of 
the Yonex Canada Grand Prix tournament on Sunday.

'The
men's doubles final ended in unusual circumstances, with a black card 
being issued to Thailand pair, Bodin Issara and Pakkawat Vilailak, who 
were disqualified.

'Their opponents were another Thai duo, Maneepong Jongjit and Nipitphon Puangpuapech.

'The events surrounding the conclusion of this match will be thoroughly investigated by the BWF.

'The world governing body has procedures in place to deal with such situations and this matter will be referred to the disciplinary committee.

'Until this process is concluded there will be no further comment by the BWF.'

Jongjit and Issara reached the quarter-finals at London 2012 but split up in January when the latter announced his retirement, citing injury and a need to care for his mother.

But the 22-year-old resumed competition with a new partner soon after.

This latest incident brings the BWF further unwanted negative publicity just a fortnight before their showpiece World Championships in China.

A year ago the Olympic badminton tournament was marred by a match-fixing scandal involving four women's doubles pairs.
