A Houston mother has been charged with neglect after her nine-year-old daughter's body was discovered stuffed inside a refrigerator six months ago.

Amber Keyes is being held Wednesday on a charge of injury to a child-serious bodily injury. 

The 35-year-old Keyes hasn't been charged with killing her daughter, Ayahna Comb, but Houston police say the neglect charge is linked to her death.

Ayahna weighed 14 pounds when some children looking for food found her body in Keyes' refrigerator in June.

Tragic: The body of Ayahna (center) was found wrapped in a blanket inside the fridge of mother Amber Keyes' (right) apartment. Ayahna, who has a younger sister (left), had been there almost five months, it's believed

A neighbor called police to the Happy Home apartments in the 10100 block of Club Creek.

At the time paramedics determined the little girl had been dead at least a month. 

An autopsy determined Ayahna, who had cerebral palsy, died of malnutrition and dehydration.

Keyes says she found Ayahna unresponsive on January 29 but couldn't revive her, so she wrapped the girl in a blanket and stashed her in the fridge.

If the account is accurate, the child would have been in the fridge for over four months. 

Ayahna could not talk, was confined to a wheelchair and had to be bottle-fed.

An attorney for Keyes didn't immediately comment. 

Bond was set at $50,000.

Scene: The dead girl was found in the refrigerator of a home at The Happy Home Apartments (pictured) in Houston, Texas in June. Investigators believe that she had been there for five months

Keyes also has a criminal record.

She was arrested for possession of a controlled substance in 1998 and spent over 12 months in prison as a result.

She then spent 30 days in jail for a criminal trespass charge in 2000.

Keyes previously lost custody of another child more than a decade ago.

USA Today reported that Child Protective Services removed an 18-month-old that suffered physical abuse in 2002.

The child was placed in foster care.

Keyes went on to have another two other children, both daughters, one of which was Ayahna.

The father of the two older girls, Armand Comb, broke down in tears after learning of Ayahna's death earlier this year.

Comb said he last saw his daughter about two months before her body was discovered and that she appeared to be in good health.

Tears: The girl's father Armand Comb said that he had no idea his daughter was dead and claimed to have seen her two months before her body was found in June

'Last time I saw her, she was looking good. It looked like she was gaining weight. Her cheeks were kind of fat. I would never, never suspect that,' he told KHOU in June.

Comb said he spoke to his ex-girlfriend on  the day his daughter was discovered and that Keyes 'was talking like she was there with them'.

'I just want to know what happened man, why? I was right here I would've helped. I would've done anything.'
