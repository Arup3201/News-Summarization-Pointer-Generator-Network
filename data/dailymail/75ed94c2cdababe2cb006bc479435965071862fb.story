Stephen Lawrence, from Eltham, south-east London, was murdered in a racially motivated attack while waiting for a bus on the evening of April 22, 1993

Internationally acclaimed architect David Adjaye will speak about his work at an event in memory of Stephen Lawrence.

Stephen had dreamed of becoming an architect before he was stabbed to death aged 18 in an unprovoked racist attack in 1993.

In a fitting tribute to the teenager, Mr Adjaye will deliver the annual Stephen Lawrence Memorial Lecture on September 16 at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London.

Mr Adjaye will talk about his career, highlights of which include designing the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC and the educational Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford, south-east London.

Awarded the OBE for services to architecture in 2007, he is also a favourite to design the Barack Obama Presidential Library. If chosen, he would be the first non-American to design a presidential library.

The event is in aid of The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, which helps disadvantaged students to pursue a career in architecture.

Tickets for the lecture cost £20 full price or £5 for students at http://stephenlawrencetrust.eventbrite.co.uk.

The trust’s website is at www.stephenlawrence.org.uk.
