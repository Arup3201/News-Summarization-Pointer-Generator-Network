A newborn baby girl was listed in extremely critical condition Tuesday after her 24-year-old mother left her in a neighbor's trash can in Utah just three days after delivery.

A woman heard what she thought was a kitten meowing in the trash bin in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns at around 7am Tuesday and discovered the newborn, Unified Police Detective Jared Richardson said.

The child was airlifted to a hospital in Salt Lake City, where she is now on a ventilator and fighting for her life.

Neighbors heard the little girl's cries coming from this trash bin but at first mistook them for a kitten meowing 

Her mother, who was being questioned by police, later returned and told officers she had left the baby about an hour before the child was found.

Salt Lake County Sheriff Jim Winder, who oversees the Unified Police Department, said authorities believe the baby girl was born Sunday.

Winder said at a news conference that investigators did not have any information about where the mother gave birth or why she may have left the baby in the trash can.

'We had a young lady make a very, very terrible decision,' he said.

On Tuesday evening, a woman who identified herself to Good4Utah as the young mother's sister came forward claiming that the 24-year-old did not know she was pregnant.

'She doesn't think like a 24-year-old,' the woman explained, adding that her sister has learning disabilities.  

Police would decide whether to arrest the mother after interviewing her, Winder said. The 24-year-old mother of one was taken to a hospital earlier today to receive medical attention and undergo a mental evaluation.

Generally, anyone who abandons a child can face felony charges, in addition to any abuse or neglect charges, he said.

There were no visible injuries to the child, who appears to have been suffering from a general lack of medical care. There is also no information about the newborn's father, Winder said.

The mother's sister said the woman has learning disabilities and did not even know she was pregnant 

At the news conference, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams and health officials listed resources available for expectant and new mothers, including a crisis hotline and the state's safe haven law, which allows mothers to leave newborns at hospitals, no questions asked.

A handful of infants are dropped off at Utah hospitals under the safe haven law every year, said Al Romeo with the Utah Department of Health.

It's not common for a mother to abandon a child in a trash can or other unsafe place, but there have been a few cases over the past 10 years, he said.

Romeo cited the discovery in April of seven dead newborn babies in the garage of a home in Pleasant Grove, Utah. Police believe the mother killed six of the infants after giving birth to them over a decade. A seventh baby is believed to have been stillborn.
