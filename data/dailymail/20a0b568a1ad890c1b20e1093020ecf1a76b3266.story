A UKIP politician took his young female researcher to a strip bar and watched as a topless dancer cavorted in front of them, it was claimed last night.

Roger Helmer, a married MEP who is standing in next month’s Newark by-election, took Alexandra Swann, then 24, to the Manhattan bar in Brussels, she claims.

Miss Swann says she was made to feel ‘deeply uncomfortable’ by the 70-year-old’s behaviour, but felt unable to speak out for fear of losing her job.

Miss Swann, a former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party youth wing who defected to UKIP in 2012, worked for Mr Helmer for five months that year while he was attending the European Parliament.

She claims she was later pressured by Mr Helmer to resign, and threatened by another UKIP member that her reputation would be ‘trashed’ if she ever spoke publicly about the strip bar.

Mr Helmer, who has been married twice and has children with his first wife, strongly denies the allegations and described Miss Swann as ‘a serial fantasist’.

Miss Swann began working for Mr 
Helmer in April 2012, said they visited the bar in September that year.

She added: ‘The bar was called Manhattan. I had never heard of it but 
now I know it is where a lot of MEPs go. There were scantily-clad women 
and they were dancing.

‘It was deeply uncomfortable, but what could I do? I loved my job.’

Miss Swann, now 26, said that straight after the UKIP conference in Basingstoke that year, Mr Helmer sacked her.

Last night Mr Helmer said: ‘I have a vague recollection of what she might be referring to.

‘After
 a meal with my staff, she wanted to have another drink and I took her 
to a bar. It became clear it was a bit of a dodgy bar, so we finished 
our beers and left. The detail is frankly a load of nonsense.’
