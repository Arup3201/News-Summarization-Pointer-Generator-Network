A woman who stole more than £100,000 from her employers has been ordered to repay just £1 after blowing it all on a lavish lifestyle.

Accounts assistant Lauren Cherry treated herself to expensive holidays, designer clothes and jewellery on the looted cash over a period of six months. As a result of her crime, the small firm where she worked was forced to close and four people lost their jobs.

Cherry, 32, said she was suffering from depression and low self-esteem and went on the spending sprees to give herself ‘a lift’.

Accounts assistant Lauren Cherry, who stole more than £100,000 from her firm in just six months, has been ordered to pay back just £1 after she blew the lot on holidays, designer clothes and jewellery

She admitted stealing £104,320 and was jailed for 25 months by a judge who condemned her ‘concerted, calculated and consistent’ conduct.

But because she has no assets, Judge David Griffith-Jones QC made a nominal confiscation order for £1, to be paid within 28 days. Maidstone Crown Court heard how Cherry joined F P Mailing (Premier) in Dartford, Kent, in April 2012 and started stealing within two months.

Prosecutor John Turner said she earned about £1,400 gross a month and had access to the online banking system and made transfers to six personal accounts. She disguised it by saying they were transfers within the company, which supplied franking machines.

By August there were concerns about her bookkeeping and absence because of illness. When challenged about the transfers, she claimed they were made by mistake, but she was sacked.

‘It is fair to describe her lifestyle as extravagant,’ Mr Turner said. ‘There were designer clothes and jewellery. There were a number of holidays.’ She even bought presents for her work colleagues, he said.

Cherry started taking the money just two months after she started work at franking machine suppliers FP Mailing (Premier) in Dartford, Kent

Simon Wickens, for Cherry, of Gravesend, Kent, said she had suffered from depression and low self-worth over the years. Her world ‘fell apart’ when her long-term partner cheated on her and left her.

He said: ‘She was left with debts. She was in a property she couldn’t afford. Most significantly, she was emotionally destroyed. This offence appears to be borne out of that.

‘Things spiralled. The missing money went unnoticed. She bought things to make her feel better. Her family thought she was doing amazingly well. She was treating others to build up an image of a happy life.’

The court heard that the company had to be wound up because of Cherry’s crime and 15 people lost their jobs, although 11 were re-employed by a new franchise of the firm.

The judge told Cherry: ‘It is very troubling to see someone like you standing in the dock awaiting sentence for what is in any view a serious offence. You were motivated by greed. It is fair to say you took a long time to accept your responsibility in the face of compelling evidence.’

After the case, a director of the company, who asked not to be named, said: ‘She would take people out, buying everyone Christmas presents.

‘But it was our money she was doing it with.’
