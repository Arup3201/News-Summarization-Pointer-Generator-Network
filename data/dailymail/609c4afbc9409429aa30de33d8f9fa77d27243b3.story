A woman arrested on suspicion of murdering her three-year-old granddaughter was previously investigated for child abuse, according to police records.

Carida ‘Charity’ Cobb, 41, from Tampa, Florida, was arrested on Friday on charges of first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse following the death of Yanelli Vasquez on December 13.

Cobb was previously investigated and subsequently cleared of assaulting Yanelli’s two-year-old brother, according to a report from the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office.

Released on Monday, it states that in April 2012, Cobb allegedly ‘beat the c*** out of’ Yanelli’s brother simply because he burst into tears.

But detectives closed the investigation because Mrs Cobb denied the allegation and no suspicious injuries were found on the child, The Tampa Bay Times reports.

Meanwhile, Cobb claims that Yanelli was killed after she fell on top of her at bath time.

However, highly suspicious bruises were found on Yanelli's back and forehead and she'd suffered internal bleeding, so Cobb was arrested.

Paramedics had arrived at the house they lived in to find Cobb straddling Yanelli and shaking her, apparently in a bid to revive her.

Yanelli was put in her grandmother's care after the mother, Maria Vasquez, 27, was found to have a drug habit – she’d tested positive for cocaine, marijuana, ecstasy, oxycodone and methamphetamine - and because of reports of violence in the family.
