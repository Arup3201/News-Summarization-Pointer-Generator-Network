Lukas Podolski was mobbed by fans as he arrived in Milan to tie up a loan move to Inter. 

The 29-year-old wore a scarf with the club's famous black and blue colours as he signed autographs and posed for pictures at Milan's Linate Airport.

Podolski is expected to sign on loan for Roberto Mancini's side until the end of the season in a deal which will cost the Italians £1.5million.

Podolski's Arsenal days look like they could be numbered as he is set to sign a loan deal to Inter

Speaking to Sky Italia, he said: 'I spoke to Mancini and think he’s a great coach. He wanted me and I’m happy to be here. I know Serie A, it’s a very competitive League.

'I want to help the team get into the Champions League. Do I have a message for the fans? I am happy, Forza Inter and we hope to have a great season.'

The unsettled Germany forward has one year on his Arsenal contract at the end of this season and may not return if his loan is successful. 

Podolski missed Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to Southampton on New Year's Day due to injury, and Arsene Wenger revealed that the club had received an improved bid from the Italian giants - he called Inter's previous offer 'farcical'. 

He has featured in thirteen of the Gunners' games this season but only managed to find the net three times, all of which came in the Champions League.

Podolski has flourished in Europe this season but has been given limited opportunities in the Premier League.  

Podolski would be joining up with a struggling Inter side who currently sit eleventh in Serie A and have only managed one win in the league since the beginning of November.

The 29-year-old has spent much of the season on the bench, making just 13 appearances for Arsenal 

Inter manager Roberto Mancini will be hoping Podoloski can help his side climb up the Serie A table
