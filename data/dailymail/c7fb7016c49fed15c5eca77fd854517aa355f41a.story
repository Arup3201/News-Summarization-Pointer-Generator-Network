A set of murals whose removal prompted one of Britain's most noble fathers to boycott his son's wedding is returning to the family's magnificent stately home.

Lord Bath, 81, was incensed when the Heaven and Hell murals he painted were removed from Longleat, Wiltshire, after his son Ceawlin took over the running of the ancestral pile - which includes 900 acres of grounds and a safari park.

Now the flamboyant artworks will be reinstated - in a corridor one storey above their former home.

Feud: The Marquess of Bath, 81, with one of the Heaven and Hell murals removed from his ancestral stately home of Longleat, Wiltshire. The row prompted him to boycott his son's wedding, the told the Mail on Sunday

Anger: Lord Bath and his son, whose title is Viscount Weymouth, in happier times at Longleat Safari Park

Mural: One example from what became known as the 'Heaven and Hell corridor' in the stately home

Ceawlin, whose title is Viscount Weymouth, sparked an apparent family feud earlier this year when his father's hand-painted murals disappeared from Longleat.

The painter did not attend his son's wedding at the Elizabethan stately home, telling the Mail on Sunday: ‘I only found out once the removal had
started. It’s my life’s work and he’s quietly binned it.

Lord Bath's daughter-in-law Emma McQuiston, pictured, insisted the whole row was caused by a mix-up

'It’s killed my relationship with him and I don’t feel inclined to pay 
any interest in his wedding.’

Instead of attending his son's wedding, Lord Bath and his wife pointedly went to the wedding of a
family friend in Hampshire.

But his son's new wife was devastated, saying it was a misunderstanding and the murals were simply in storage.

Emma McQuiston, a TV chef who became the first black viscountess when she married Ceawlin this summer, said: 'I can assure you that none of the murals that were previously in place in our apartment have been “binned”.

'The ones Ceawlin has moved have been very carefully preserved.'

Longleat is one of the finest examples of Tudor architecture in England and has been in Lord Bath's family for 473 years.

Bought by Sir John Thynne for £53 in 1540, the original house burned down a few years later but had been mostly rebuilt by 1580 and is now open to the public.

It is home to one of the largest private book collections in Europe and the Great Hall contains the bloodied silk-sleeved waistcoat which was worn by Charles I at his execution in 1649.

A planning application lodged with Wiltshire Council confirmed the murals will be re-hung in the south corridor on the second floor.

The new home for the artwork is one storey higher than its original home, which became known as 'Heaven & Hell passage'.

A spokesman for Benjamin & Beauchamp, a Somerset architect firm, said: 'The Heaven and Hell murals are currently held in store.

'Following careful checking of room sizes, it was confirmed the artwork would fit largely unaltered, within the second floor south passage.

Magnificent: Longleat was built in the mid-1500s and is one of the best examples of Elizabethan architecture

Artist: Lord Bath, whose full name is Alexander George Thynn, painted several murals in the house himself

'The height of the ceiling means the central inscription, a simple text on a plain board, will need to be smaller.

'The artwork has been aligned to fit along the length of the existing passage without interfering with fire doors.

'However,
the current door positions in the murals will need to be closed off, 
and new openings formed, corresponding to the existing passageway door 
locations, serving the rooms beyond.

'The proposed works are entirely reversible, thereby following good conservation practice.'
