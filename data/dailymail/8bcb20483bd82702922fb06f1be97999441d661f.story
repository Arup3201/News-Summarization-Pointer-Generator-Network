Adrian Smith has been labelled 'Britain's dumbest motorist' after he alerted police to his cannabis farm by trying to burn down a roadside speed camera

When Adrian Smith was caught speeding a second time, he mistakenly thought he would be banned from driving for good.

So in a bid to escape punishment, he decided to set fire to the speed camera that caught him and destroy all evidence of his crime.

But Mr Smith, 46, who has now been described as ‘Britain’s dumbest motorist’, was caught in the act by another camera nearby which led police directly to his door.

And that was not the end of the nightclub doorman’s plight.

When police arrived at his home, they found he was guilty of a second, equally serious crime.

To their amazement they discovered Mr Smith was also keeping a secret cannabis farm in his basement.

The bungling motorist had inadvertently alerted police to two crimes in his unsuccessful attempt to destroy evidence of another.

And to make matters worse, it later emerged that he in fact would likely not have received any points on his license and therefore wouldn’t have faced a driving ban as he thought.

He has now been sentenced to two years in prison at Lincoln Crown Court after admitting arson and producing cannabis and possessing the drug with intent to supply.

Mr Smith, from Shireoaks in Nottinghamshire, believed he already had six penalty points on his licence, was caught speeding on the A57 near Dunham Bridge, in Lincolnshire, on 21 February, as he made his way to work.

That evening he convinced himself he would receive another six points on his licence and would therefore no longer be able to drive.

Around 36 hours after he was caught - 8mph over the 60mph limit - he placed several tyres underneath the camera with an accelerant, set them alight and destroyed the camera.

The heat from the burning tyres caused £12,000 worth of damage to the infrastructure of the camera and police spent a further £12,000 on installing a replacement.

Smith set fire to the camera because he wrongly feared he would be banned from driving if he took the points

Jonathon Dee, prosecuting, said that Mr Smith only realised the futility of the arson attack during a police interview following his arrest.

Mr Dee said: ‘He made full admissions describing it as something he had done in panic. When he was told he would not have lost his licence you can almost audibly hear the sense of self-reproach and the realisation that he had done something stupid.’

Martin Keys, defending, admitted: ‘He has not really got an excuse for damaging the camera other than that he was stupid and acted on the spur of the moment.

'He was always going to get caught. He has always been very remorseful. From the start he has always apologised. 

'He did something very serious and now he is paying the price.’

Mr Smith’s commercial drug operation was capable of producing 3.5kgs of cannabis worth around £35,000 when sold on the streets.

Judge Sean Morris told him: ‘You are not the first person to stand before me for setting fire to a speed camera. People need to know that anyone who does that will go to prison.

‘These speed cameras save lives. They moderate people’s driving. This county has the worst roads in England for death and serious injury. That is why we have so many speed cameras.

'People who set fire to speed cameras must realise the consequences are a hundred times worse than taking the fine. A custodial sentence is inevitable.’

John Siddle of the Lincolnshire Road Safety Partnership said: ‘These things are always done in a moment of madness and people think they will not get caught.

'The reality is that when a camera is attacked we will always pursue those responsible and we will catch them.’
