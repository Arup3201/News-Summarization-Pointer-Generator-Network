Exposure to a rare metal found in mobile phones could double an individual’s risk of stroke, scientists warned.

High levels of tungsten significantly raises the risk of the disease, particularly for those under the age of 50, a new study has found.

Although our current exposure to the precious metal is low, it is being increasingly used in everyday items such mobile phones, computers and light bulbs.

In the past decade, production has almost doubled, as advances in technology continue to drive demand. Experts now fear its increased prevalence could pose a health risk to future generations.

During its production, small amounts of the metal escape into the environment, eventually making their way into rivers and farmland.

Exposure to tiny amounts present in the air, drinking water and in the food chain is common, but it remains unclear why certain individuals have higher levels.

Researchers said there is no clear evidence linking use of technology such as smartphones and laptops to increased amounts of the metal in the blood.

‘Whilst currently very low, human exposure to tungsten is set to increase,’ said lead researcher Dr Jessica Tyrrell, from the University of Exeter.

‘We’re not yet sure why some members of the population have higher levels of the metal in their make-up, and an important step in understanding and preventing the risks it may pose to health will be to get to the bottom of how it’s ending up in our bodies.’

The study, published in the journal Public Library of Science ONE, looked at 8,614 US adults aged between 18 and 74 over a 12-year period.

Individuals with high concentrations of tungsten in their system were found to be twice as likely to suffer a stroke, independent of typical risk factors.

More than 150,000 people have a stroke each year, and it is the fourth largest cause of death in Britain after cancer, heart disease and respiratory disease.

Stroke is also the leading cause of adult disability, with more than half of all survivors left dependent on carers for everyday assistance.

Co-author Dr Nicholas Osborne said: ‘The relationship we’re seeing between tungsten and stroke may only be the tip of the iceberg.

'As numerous new substances make their way into the environment, we’re accumulating a complex ‘chemical cocktail’ in our bodies.

‘Currently we have incredibly limited information on the health effects of individual chemicals and no research has explored how these compounds might interact together to impact human health.’

Dr Madina Kara, Neuroscientist at the Stroke Association, said: ‘We know that environmental factors, like air pollution, can play a part in stroke risk but this is the first time we’ve seen research linking tungsten to an increase risk of stroke.

'Whilst this research reveals increased tungsten levels in those having stroke, follow-on studies are required to assess the direct effects of tungsten on our health and its link to stroke.

‘Lifestyle factors such as smoking, lack of exercise and poor diet increase your risk of stroke. High blood pressure remains the single biggest risk factor for stroke. We know that half of all strokes could be prevented if people took steps to monitor and control their blood pressure.’
