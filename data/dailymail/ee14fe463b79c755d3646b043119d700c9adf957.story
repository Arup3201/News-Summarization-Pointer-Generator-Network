These are the heart-rending postcards sent by a solider fighting on the front line during the Great War to his sweetheart back home.

Brave Fred Eason penned the cheery missives to his loyal wife, Annie, as he fought in the trenches in north-western France during the First World War.

The Royal Engineer was wounded, but survived the conflict to be reunited with his family in Cardiff, Wales.  

Love letter: Fred Eason sent this postcard from a WWI training base in north-western France  to his wife, Annie

Touching message: Mr Eason told his wife 'not to get downhearted' while he was so far away from home training to go into battle in north-western France

The touching postcards have been kept by the Eason family as a reminder of what their grandparents went through.

'When my nan died in 1973 my father inherited the house and they were in a box in the room,' said Mr Eason's granddaughter Heather Eason, 44.

'From time to time we would get them out but as a child you don't fully understand their significance.

'Reading them now, my grandfather must have known what he was going into but never showed it through his postcards to my nan. 

'We're reading them with hindsight but when they arrived at the house my nan must have been worried especially getting the letter that he was wounded.'

The couple married in 1913 and in early 1915 their first child was born.

The young father  joined the Royal Engineers aged 24 and was sent to a training base in France.

Mr Eason's first postcard to his wife, who he called Nance, is of a picture of the beach at Étretat - on the back he wrote: 'Dear Nance, Just a P.C. to say that I am leaving here for the base, so you can see that my chance of coming home is all up, but there dear, do not get downhearted for, dear, one cannot have all their own way in the army.

'Darling, do not write again until you hear from me. So, darling, I must wish you goodbye for the present. 

'I remain your loving husband Fred. Dear, I do hope that you and the baby are all right. xxxxxxxxxxx.'

He was then sent to the base near the Belgian border at Bac-Saint-Maur.

Another is a picture of the village of Bac-Saint-Maur on which he has written: 'Darling, what do you think of this place? I will tell you all about it when I come home again. xxxxxxxxxxxx.'

A further postcard, which has a picture of the Tissage Gille mill building in Bac-Saint-Maur,  reads: 'Darling what do you think of this place? xxxxxxx.'

In September 1915  Fred was wounded and his commanding officer sent a letter home to Mrs Eason. 

Dated September 16, 1915, it reads: 'I am very sorry that your husband received a bullet wound this morning whilst at work. 

'He has been taken into hospital and the doctor says he should go on all right.

'He was working behind an old parapet repairing and strengthening it, and a bullet passed through the top sandbag and passed downwards, hitting your husband in the chest, well to the left side and obviously clear of any vital part. 

'The bullet is lodged in his side, and has of course made a Big Bruise, but our doctors are now so good at wounds of all sorts and rifle bullets have been proved to be so clean in the wounds they inflict, that I hope he will be fit and well in a month or two. 

 

'When he does get well and is ready for work, I hope you will spare him to come out to us again as he is a really good worker and I should be very sorry not to get him back. 

'He will be taken back to some base hospital and very likely back to England; I cannot tell you where - but he is sure to write to you at first opportunity.

'I hope you will let me know when you manage to see him; and tell me how he is getting on. 

'Believe me, yours very truly, R H Shillimore, (Major R.E.)'

Dear Nance, 

Just a P.C. to say that I am leaving here for the base, so you can see that my chance of coming home is all up, but there dear, do not get down hearted for, dear, one cannot have all their own way in the army.

Darling, do not write again until you hear from me. 

So, darling, I must wish you goodbye for the present. 

I remain your loving husband Fred.

Dear, I do hope that you and the baby are all right. xxxxxxxxxxx.'

After a period of convalescence, Mr Eason did go back to the trenches but came safely home at the war's end. 

He went on to work  as an industrial blacksmith in Cardiff Docks and the couple had five children, before his death in 1954.

His granddaughter said: 'My aunts and uncles spoke of Fred as 'lovely, quiet man - calm and gentle' and although he died before I was born, his stories and memories have come down to me through these interesting documents and photos.'

Annie Eason received this letter from her husband's commanding officers informing her he had been shot in the chest while working in the trenches

Mr Eason's commanding officer said that he would be 'very sorry not to get him back' in a letter from the front to Annie Eason
