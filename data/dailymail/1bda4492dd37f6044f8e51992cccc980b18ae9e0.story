You can no longer buy toasters that imprint burnt images of Jesus on toast on Amazon.com.

The company Vermont Novelty Toaster Corporation's Jesus toaster was the no. 32 best-selling toaster on Amazon this Christmas season but despite the company's popularity, the Burnt Impressions branded toasters have pulled themselves off of Amazon Today.

'Pretty good for a product created by a slacker pothead,' reads the toaster company's Twitter on being named no.32.

Turn the other wheat: Burnt Impressions isn't selling their famed toaster on Amazon anymore but they are selling it on their own website

But according to the toaster company, they are a small business that doesn't appreciate the fact Amazon withholds half of their company's sales while Amazon 'reviews their account.'

According to the Vermont toaster company, Amazon also takes $8.00 for every toaster they sell and they take 15 per cent of sale proceeds including the shipping charges.

In addition to taking the crust off toaster sales, the company's withholding money while they 'review' the account makes it difficult for the toaster to operate efficiently.

Vermont Novelty Toaster corporation didn't only pull Jesus toasters. They also pulled machines that create images of The Virgin Mary, Sarah Palin, Obama.butterflies, peace signs, marijuana leaves, and paw prints reports PRnewswire.com

'We are a small business and this really hurts our cash flow. I have to wait weeks to recoup my shipping costs because of this,' said Galen Dively, the CEO of the company that creates the famed Jesus toasters.

Dively explained that pulling the toasters from Amazon may affect them financially right now, but that by saving the money the website once took from their sales, the toaster company will be able to invest in branding and in developing their website.

'It will be felt for sure; they are a huge resource of millions of customers, but at this point I am feeling confident we can use the thousands of dollars Amazon makes off our toasters each year to successfully promote sales on our website. We control our branding better this way also,' said Dively.

Dively also explains that buying the toasters directly off their own personal website is the cheapest way to purchase the item.

Dively says that some toasters have never been offered on amazon, one of which is a personalized toaster that will imprint whatever picture the customer chooses.

Burnt Impressions toasters prides itself on bringing a personalized twist to everyday food items like toast. They can be purchased at Jesustoasters.com.

The Mail Online tried contacting a representative from Amazon.com, but no one was available for comment.

Not too crumby: The specialty toasters can still be purchased on the company's website which sells many styles and models
