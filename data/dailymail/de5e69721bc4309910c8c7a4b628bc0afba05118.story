An unlucky couple both ended up in hospital with broken hips after the wife’s walking stick got stuck between the cracks of a new multi-million pound footpath.

Cath Henry, 81, and her husband Lindon, 80, were walking arm-in-arm while on their way to a Gala Bingo hall in Stoke-on-Trent, Stafforshire when her stick became jammed in grooves designed to help the visually impaired.

Mr Henry went crashing to the ground as he tried to save her and both pensioners suffered fractures to their hips in the fall.

Members of the public rushed to the couple’s aid before an ambulance arrived and they were taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

They have since been moved to Haywood Hospital where they will spend the next few weeks at opposite ends of the same ward.

Mr Henry - who has already had a hip replacement - said: ‘As we started to walk to Gala Bingo, Cath linked our arms and we started to cross the road.

‘My wife suddenly got her stick caught fast in the grooves on the pavement and started to fall over.

‘As our arms were still linked she tried to shove me away. I tried to save her but we just went over.

‘Cath was flat out on the ground and we were both quite shaken up. I was just in shock when it happened and I panicked. I was so worried about her.’

Mrs Henry, who has had pins and screws in her leg, added: ‘I thought we were going for a nice night out at the bingo and then next thing I'm in hospital.

‘It was horrible breaking my right hip.’

Stoke-on-Trent City Council spend millions of pounds on renovating the pavements and seating in the area

The great-grandparents fell in Stafford Street in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, on October 10, where council leaders have spent millions of pounds on new paving and seating.

The area where Mrs Henry’s walking stick got stuck was between pavement grooves which are there to help visually impaired pedestrians realise they are crossing between the road and pavement.

The couple is now calling for the council to rip up the paving slabs, which were laid down as part of a multi-million pound transformation of the city centre.

Mr Henry, a retired pottery artist, said: ‘The pavement there is very bumpy and it is bad for disabled people trying to walk over it. The council wants to repave it.

‘I know we're not getting any younger, but when you walk on those grooves you're over.

‘I understand they need to be there, but it is terribly unstable for older people and those with walking sticks.’

Their daughter, Sam Henry, 51, said: ‘I was completely shocked.

‘They had gone out for a game of bingo and then they end up in hospital needing operations on broken hips.

‘The pavements can be quite dodgy there.’

Daughter-in-law Jayne Henry, 53, said the couple - who have been married for 60 years - were hoping to return to their home as soon as possible. 

She added: ‘They are a bit distraught not being able to look after each other. ‘At first the nurses were wheeling Cath's bed down to Lindon and then she was in a wheelchair. 

‘They were close to each other but it was a bit too far to walk after their injuries.

‘They have been moved to the Haywood Hospital now and we are hoping they will be home soon. 

‘Lindon is walking a bit better now but Cath is still having trouble.’ 

Mr Henry and his wife, a retired seamstress, have three children - Laraine Hudson, 59, Lindon Henry, 54, and Sam, 51. 

The couple - who still live together independently - also have eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

Disability campaigners have also raised concerns about the new-look streets and said the kerb and roads should be painted different colours.

Pam Bryan, secretary of the Stoke-on-Trent Area Network for Disability group, said: ‘The council is aware there are issues.

‘The kerb and the road are the same colour and people not aware they are approaching it are tripping over it.

‘It predominantly affects the elderly. The council has tried to alleviate the problem by putting metal studs in the kerb edge to try to make it more apparent, but it has not improved things.

‘In light of this accident, we would like them to look at the problems again.’

Stoke-on-Trent City Council has used millions of pounds of European cash to install new paving across a number of streets in Hanley.

The grooved slabs were a legal requirement and comply with Disability Discrimination Act and Department for Transport guidelines.

Councillor Ruth Rosenau, cabinet member for transportation, said: ‘This is a most unfortunate accident and our very best wishes go to Mr and Mrs Henry.

‘The public realm improvements have been designed to reduce traffic into the city centre.

‘In this area, only buses and taxis are able to access the road, and the pavement and the road are on the same level to improve the look and feel of the environment for visitors.

‘We worked closely with the RNIB, Guide Dogs UK and Action for Blind People in developing the improvement works, and the raised surface along the edge of the paving area is necessary to distinguish between pedestrian and vehicle routes.’
