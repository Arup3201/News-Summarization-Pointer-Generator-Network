An Oklahoma jury today convicted a 17-year-old of first-degree murder in the shooting death of an Australian college baseball player who was killed while out for a jog.

The Stephens County jury found Chancey Allen Luna guilty in the August 16, 2013, death of Christopher Lane, who was shot in the back while running along a city street in Duncan. The jury recommended that Luna be sentenced to life in prison without parole.

Defense attorneys acknowledged that Luna fired the fatal shot from a passing car that he was riding in, but contended that he meant only to scare Lane.

Belated apology: As he was being led out of the courtroom, Luna told reporters he was 'sorry' 

Reckless: Luna's defense lawyer contended that the teen meant only to scare Lane when he shot at him from a moving car 

'There was no motive, no plan to kill anyone,' defense attorney Jim Berry said during opening statements. 'This is a reckless action by a 16-year-old child.'

The defense had asked that the jury be allowed to consider a second-degree murder conviction, a request that the judge denied earlier Friday. Second-degree murder would have carried a sentence of 10 years to life in prison.

Luna did not testify and the defense called just one witness, Luna's mother, Jennifer Luna. In her brief testimony, Jennifer Luna said her son lived with her parents after he was born and that his father is in jail.

'I wasn't there half the time,' she said.

She also insisted from the witness stand that her boy would never hurt anyone intentionally.  

'If my son did it, it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't meant to be. My son would never intentionally try to hurt somebody at all.'

Dressed in a blue button-down shirt and a striped tie, Chancey Luna was stoned-faced when the jurors announced the guilty verdict. 

Satisfied: Donna Lane, left, the victim's mother, was pleased with the verdict, saying in reference to Luna that the 'naughty boy' will never hurt another family again

Jennifer Luna, Chancey's mother picture din court Friday, testified that her son would never hurt someone intentionally 

However, as he was being led in handcuffs and shackles out of the courtroom, the teenager told a swarm of reporters he was 'sorry.'

Lane's parents and sister, who had read heartbreaking victim impact statements before the verdict was announced, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the trial. 

'This naughty boy is never going to do this to any other family,' Donna Lane told the media, according to Sydney Morning News. 

A co-defendant in the case, James 'Bug' Edwards Jr., now 17, testified that he was a passenger in the car when it swerved toward Lane, and Luna fired the shot. 

Edwards testified as part of a plea agreement in which a first-degree murder charge against him was reduced to being an accessory after the fact.

Parents: Donna Lane, pictured left in court Thursday wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Jennifer Luna (right) said her son lived with her parents and she was not there 'half the time' 

The car's driver, Michael Jones, now 19, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder as part of a plea bargain, but refused to testify for the prosecution. He is serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole.

The doctor who performed the autopsy on Lane testified that even immediate medical attention would not have saved his life.

'Apart from a miracle, no,' said Dr. Inas Yacoub, a forensic pathologist with the state medical examiner's office.

Yacoub testified that a .22-caliber bullet was recovered from Lane's body.

Torn apart: Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was visiting his girlfriend, Sarah Harper, and her family in Duncan when he was killed 

'Despite being small, it damaged vital structures and caused significant bleeding,' Yacoub told jurors, striking two major blood vessels, puncturing both lungs and breaking two ribs.

The victim's mother, Donna Lane, wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Lane and family members also wept during testimony by witnesses who tried to comfort Lane as he lay dying.

Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was in Oklahoma on a college baseball scholarship. He was a catcher and preparing for his senior year at East Central University in Ada and was visiting his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot.
