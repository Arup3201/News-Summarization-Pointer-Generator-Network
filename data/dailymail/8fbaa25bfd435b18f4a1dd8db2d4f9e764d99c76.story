The most worrying thing about Andy Murray’s exit is the fact it suggested a regression in the mental side of his game to the pre-Ivan Lendl days. He lost meekly and there was no fighting spirit.

It was a 1/10 performance from a mental point of view — the sort of display that you would never conceive of from a great player like he is. Andy had the demeanour of a first-round loser rather than a defending champion and he deserves to be criticised for his poor attitude.

He was grumbling right from the start of the match and giving all the wrong signals to his opponent Grigor Dimitrov, who himself was nervous and there for the taking at times.

Anger: Andy Murray was out of sorts against Grigor Dimitrov and seemed to lose his head

Fallout: Murray's quarter-final exit at Wimbledon has led to him having to re-assess his team

I don’t know why Andy was shouting ‘f****** five minutes before the match,’ up at his box but that is the sort of negative thing he cut out under Lendl and it’s creeping back in again.

I don’t think he’ll end his partnership with Amelie Mauresmo immediately and she deserves some time but it hasn’t been an immediate success.

There were concerning signs from the start. Andy said he’d appointed her because she was a ‘good listener’. Well I’ve got news for him – it’s you who should be doing the listening, not the other way round.

Amelie is a Grand Slam winner and was tactically very good throughout her career but Andy needs someone who will set standards and enforce rules, not simply someone to lend an ear.

After the match he said he was going to go away and work on certain aspects of his game but I think he was playing the best tennis of his life in the opening three rounds - there didn’t seem to be any problems with his form.

It is 90 per cent mental with Andy and that’s the area he needs to address because if he doesn’t get back to how he was in the Lendl days he won’t win another Slam.

Pushing himself? Or maybe, the disastrous performance was all down to Murray himself?

Lendl cut out his main weakness, which was the mental side, and him not being in his corner this time round was a big negative.

I don’t think dropping down to 10 in the world is a big crisis for Andy but he does need to get back on the right track quickly.

If Amelie doesn’t stay around I think he still needs a Grand Slam winner as his coach, someone who has been as good, if not better, than he is. He might look towards someone like Mats Wilander, Jimmy Connors or even John McEnroe, if they would do the job and commit to the travelling.

His assistant coach and hitting partner Dani Vallverdu has been a big part of his success over the years. They first met at a Barcelona tennis academy and he has been by Murray’s side almost constantly for the last four years.

But in football the assistant manager usually wants to move up and be the boss eventually. Dani might be getting frustrated about being told ‘you’re doing a good job but I need someone extra, a big name to be the main coach’. That’s possibly a source of friction.

Experience: Murray could look to a former Grand Slam champion like Mats Wilander (pictured) as a coach

Kyle Edmund is our top young prospect in the men’s game and we’ve got a lot riding on him.

He’s 320 in the world but is still only 19. The question is whether his coach Greg Rusedski has the credentials to take him to the next level. 

I’m not sure how many days Greg is contracted to work with Kyle but at this stage in his career he needs someone there all the time and I’m not sure having a part-time coach is the best idea.

Greg plays a lot of seniors matches, does TV work and makes a lot of corporate appearances so I’m not sure he’s in the position where Kyle is his priority week in, week out.

Kyle has the potential to be a top player but what you don’t want to see is him regressing because he doesn’t have the right team around him.

Potential: Kyle Edmund is the top British prospect and Greg Rusedski could be great for him

Roger Federer is a great story - to be one game away from being an eight-time Wimbledon champion is absolutely mind-boggling.

He loves the game more than anyone and that has been clear this fortnight.

The fact that he is still at the top of his game as a father of four is credit to the team he has around him, particularly his wife Mirka. Everything is very regimented with Roger as I understand - every part of his life, from training to eating to spending time with his kids, is mapped out with military precision

Often parents on tour feel torn because their family stay at home while they travel but Roger’s family go everywhere with him so he doesn’t have that dilemma. I heard that he and his wife have never spent a night apart since they married and she is definitely his rock.

The crowd are likely to be heavily behind Roger but I think Novak Djokovic will be holding the winner’s trophy - he might just get too many balls back into play to counteract Roger’s serve.

Incredible: Roger Federer is one win away from a record eighth Wimbledon title
