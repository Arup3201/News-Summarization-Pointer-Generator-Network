Aston Villa dished out the rough stuff to Mario Balotelli and Liverpool, but can claim the tactic was justified as Paul Lambert’s men climbed to second in the Premier League following captain Gabby Agbonlahor’s shock winner.

Balotelli, making his Anfield debut after a £16million move from AC Milan, appeared to be targeted by Villa to try and make him lose his temper, particularly when Philippe Senderos kicked him off the ball. Substitute Raheem Sterling was also the victim of a bad, late tackle from Alan Hutton.

But any collateral damage in public relations terms will hardly dampen Villa’s spirits after Agbonlahor celebrated his new four-year contract with a goal poacher’s effort after nine minutes.

Manager Lambert will point out that only one Villa player, Hutton, was booked and on Saturday only Chelsea sit above them in the Premier League table.

Even though £25m England midfielder Adam Lallana and Manchester United reject Tom Cleverley were making club debuts, one-man publicity machine Balotelli was predictably the centre of attention.

Super Mario’s name was cheered louder than anyone else’s and a Liverpool lap-dancing club hired a plane to fly overhead and advertise their wares. Being photographed outside such an establishment was one of Balotelli’s many misdemeanours during his eventful spell at Manchester City.

Even with golden boy Sterling left on the bench following his England exertions and Daniel Sturridge out with a thigh injury picked up on international duty, Liverpool made a bright start with Lazar Markovic attempting an ambitious volley from Alberto Moreno’s cross that flew just too high.

But Villa were surprisingly adventurous to and there had already been a couple of panicky moments in the home defence when they struck.

Ashley Westwood’s corner was met by the head of Senderos. Javier Manquillo blocked unconvincingly and before he could have a second go at clearing, Agbonlahor nipped in to scoop the ball in from a prostrate position. It was the striker’s second goal in consecutive games.

Lallana, who had signed from Southampton early in the summer but sidelined by a knee injury until now, showed his frustration by going in late on Cleverley and collecting a booking.

The Kop then vented their displeasure when lax Liverpool marking allowed Senderos a free header from Westwood’s free-kick which he missed.

As for Balotelli, he was quiet but certainly not anonymous, certainly not to the Villa antagonists.

Andy Weimann claimed, unconvincingly, that Balotelli had dived after the Villa man had clipped him from behind.

More seriously, the Italian hit the turf again when Senderos kicked him in the calf while referee Lee Mason was looking elsewhere. The Swiss defender was trying to stop Balotelli running into the area and was lucky it went unseen. 

If Villa assistant Roy Keane – never popular at Anfield – had dared to appear in the technical area before he finally appeared to galvanise the troops in injury-time, you would imagine he’d have been pleased with his centre-half.

Then, Hutton caught Balotellli by the touchline, high on the thigh. It was to Balotelli’s credit he kept his cool and even applauded The Kop as he was substituted after a frustrating day.

The only piece of real link-up play between him and Lallana in the No 10 role came when Balotelli laid off and Lallana hit a rising half-volley wide with Brad Guzan well beaten.

Balotelli’s only other moment was a spectacular solo strike that was deflected for a corner after he’d been brilliantly picked out by Gerrard.

Following an insipid start to the second-half, Rodgers succumbed to the temptation of throwing on Sterling after an hour even though he ideally wanted him rested for Tuesday’s Champions League opener against Ludogorets.

Within seconds he turned on the turbo’s to reach Philippe Coutinho’s pass and was flattened by a late tackle by Hutton, who was booked.

It says a lot for 19-year-old Sterling’s ability how quickly Liverpool now regard him as the go-to man following Luis Suarez’s departure.

He was joined by fellow subs Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini for the last 20 minutes, a remarkable turnaround for Borini who rejected moves to Sunderland and QPR on transfer deadline day.

It was Coutinho who came closest to proving an equaliser though. He twisted his way to the edge of the Villa penalty area before hitting a strike against the post with Guzan rooted to the spot.

Ultimately though, on a day of great expectation on Merseyide, it was the underdogs who were able to celebrate as they maintained their unbeaten league start to the season, achieved without star defender Ron Vlaar.
