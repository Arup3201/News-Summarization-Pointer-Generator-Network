A parting school of fish allow an exploring snorkeller to swim amongst them.

The amazing scene, which was taken in the clear blue waters off the Philippines coastline, shows how fish work in unison.

Diver Whitney De Neef delved into the colony while her husband Steve photographed her adventures from above.

The couple, who live in the Philippines but are originally from Antwerp, Belgium, were there on holiday while Steve worked on a story about sea cows - or Dugongs.

However, he took a day off to spend with Whitney on a small island called Dimakya, which they spent exploring the fish in the clear water.

Photojournalist Steve, 33, said: 'We were there partly for a holiday and partly for work.

'I was there to do a story on Dugongs that still frequent the area and my wife joined me just to enjoy the island.

'My favourite picture is the one where my wife, the snorkeler, is right in the centre of the school of jacks.

'I love it because the school of fish just opened right up every time she would dive down. It's amazing to see all these fish move together.'

Steve, who met Whitney in the Philippines in 2010 while she worked as a volunteer in an orphanage, was formerly a diving instructor.

He added: 'Whitney was amazed by this school of jacks and how close they were to the beach.

'She wants to go back. I think she was more excited swimming with these fish then I was photographing them.

Steve estimates that there were over a thousand fish in the school and were so close, you could touch them

'They were very close, you could basically touch them. The fish just all hung around the whole time we were in the water.

'It's very hard to tell but there must have been over a thousand.

'The underwater world always amazes me and big schools of fish like this are incredible to watch.

'The sun was also out this day and the sun's rays piercing though this school of fish just added to the beauty of it all.'
