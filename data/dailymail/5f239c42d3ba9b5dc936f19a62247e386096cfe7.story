Costly: Ammanford Police Station in South Wales, which will cost taxpayers £700,000-a-year for 30 years - even though it is closed to the public

A state-of-the-art police station is to cost taxpayers a total of £21million over the next 30 years, even though it is closed to the public.

The front desk at the station, which opened 11 years ago in a 30-year private finance deal, is shut to save costs, and has been replaced by a mobile police van in the car park for eight-hours-a-week.

But police are still committed to handing over £700,000-a-year for the station at Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, South Wales, in the finance deal until 2031.

The total cost for the building, which provides a home for the force's Hi-tech Crime Unit and the Neighbourhood Policing Team for the Amman Towry area, will be £21m - almost 10 times the cost of building the station.

Acting Chief Constable Jackie Roberts admitted the Ammanford station is 'too costly' and 'does not provide the public with value for money'.

And Christopher Salmon, Police and Crime Commissioner in Dyfed Powys, said: 'What we've ended up with somehow is a state-of-the-art police station in the wrong place for the wrong price

'I've inherited it and I know it's very expensive and it takes up a lot of my estates budget.

'It's deeply disappointing and particularly frustrating when obviously the police service is facing tough financial times as many public services are.

'We have this contract that we appear to be tied into that does cost us a lot of money.'

The police station was built in a private finance initiative deal between the former Dyfed-Powys Police Authority and local building firm T Richard Jones, whose own offices are next door to the police station.

Under the terms of the agreement, approved by the Home Office, TRJ used a bank loan to build the station for around £2.7m.

The force then agreed to pay an annual fee to use the building and to pay for its maintenance after it opened in 2001.

According to Home Office figures Dyfed-Powys Police agreed to hand over £700,000-a-year for the building for 30 years.

The police station is costing 18 per cent of the force's entire estates budget.

Acting Chief Constable Miss Roberts said: 'In recent years my predecessor met with the contractors in an effort to renegotiate the terms of the contract.

'However, this proved unsuccessful and currently there is no basis upon which we can seek to vary the terms of the contract in the absence of the agreement of the contractors.'

A spokesman for builders TRJ said: 'The police set the terms of the contract. There is bank funding and it is not easy to renegotiate the deal.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'The funding for this PFI was agreed under a previous administration following an application by Dyfed-Powys Police Authority.'

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Badly negotiated PFI deals from the early 2000s have already cost taxpayers billions and this is yet another example of a contract for which we will bear the cost for decades to come.

'There is nothing wrong with the principle of PFI, which brings in private sector expertise and transfers some of the risks; but too many PFI deals have left a scandalous legacy and been used to shift debts off the public sector balance sheet and conceal growing debts that taxpayers will be paying for decades to come.

'It is crucial that politicians secure a better deal for taxpayers in future.'
