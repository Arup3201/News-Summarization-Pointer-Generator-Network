Fashion friends: Mulberry's ex-creative director Emma Hill with Kate Moss

The fashion world tripped over its platform shoes this week at the news that Mulberry's creative director Emma Hill had abandoned ship.

Apparently, the one-woman whirlwind from Surrey had major 'disagreements' with the company's new CEO, Frenchman Bruno Guillon. Mulberry's share price dipped 8 per cent at the terse announcement.

Given that Hill is the transformative designer who turned Mulberry into a fashion player and a magnet for celebrities from Emma Watson to the Duchess of Cambridge, it was rather like watching the leading lady storm off in the first act. Indeed, Mulberry has had more blood on its floor than a Jacobean drama.

Only last week Hill picked up a Glamour Award for Best Accessories Designer. Vogue's May issue profiled her as 'one of the most successful names in British fashion,' and called her a 'visionary'. Last summer she became a CBE.

Even Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen, who designed the royal wedding dress, was only made an MBE.

Hill was Mulberry, Mulberry was Hill. Together, they had become a British institution. Who would have thought that they could have ever been parted?

But it seems selling lots of handbags in Britain isn't enough any more.

Mulberry has had some hits and seen an underlying rise in its rollercoaster share price, but is altogether a much patchier story than that of its home-grown rival Burberry, which has spread its trademark check over the lucrative Chinese market, and everywhere else.

Much to the chagrin of Mulberry's elusive Singaporean owner, Christina Ong, who wrestled the company from founder Roger Saul in a nasty boardroom coup ten years ago, it doesn't seem to have the global clout she desired.

There was a time, of course, when it seemed Mulberry could do no wrong.

Take the strappy Alexa bag, named after Alexa Chung and based on a man's satchel. Emma Hill called the Alexa 'the anti-It bag that became an It bag', so popular that it once had a waiting list that ran into thousands and accounted for a staggering third of Mulberry's sales.

Combined with the classic Bayswater, by 2011 Mulberry was the fastest growing luxury brand on the planet; sales in its 86 stores soared. Then came the schism.

Last year, Christina Ong hired a French luxury goods executive to take Mulberry from fashionable British bag maker to high-end international brand.

And so Mulberry poached Bruno Guillon from Hermes, the snootiest of all the French luxury brands. To Hermes, Vuitton are mere parvenus, Dior attention-seekers.

As you might imagine, French luxury goods executives are not noted for their sense of humour. So heaven knows what Monsieur Guillon made of Mulberry using giant gnomes as show props and poodles on the catwalk - or, more to the point, what he thought of the exuberant Ms Hill.

UK success: Hill with her CBE

Cue 'a culture clash of titanic proportions', as one British magazine editor described it to me.

Hill, who joined Mulberry in 2008 and had worked at Marc Jacobs and Gap, grew the brand by courting cool young things and promoting the brand at festivals.

As well as Alexa Chung, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Kristen Stewart, Kate Hudson, Florence Welch and Kirsten Dunst were all photographed at the brand's parties, pouting and sporting their Mulberry bags.

Hill saw Mulberry as 'iconic and irreverent, warm and fuzzy'. The label was known for parties: its London Fashion Week show at Claridge's had edgy young things spinning the decks.

But occasionally their exuberance misfired. As Vogue later recounted, the company's 40th birthday party in New York was such mayhem that the fashion press couldn't get in and the police shut it down. It was youthful, jolly and a little wild.

When Guillon arrived, he was confronted with Hill and her 'Mulbs', as her colleagues were known. 'Luxury with a laugh' did not appeal to the man from Hermes.

He didn't appear to be in on the joke - or the business model Hill had created.

For Guillon didn't want Mulberry to be thought of as the bag that middle-income Brits would buy as a present to themselves.

He wanted a new, expensive tier to attract a new, more expensive customer. And he didn't want a celebrity-studded front row at their shows at all, fearing that the presence of Chung - let alone a Geldof girl - might alienate as many customers as it brought in.

He has a point. Celebrities can kill brands as quickly as they boost them. Just ask Burberry, which took years to recover from exposure by its low-rent celeb fans.

Guillon told Vogue that 60 per cent of Mulberry's business was in Britain. As 'the UK is only 4 per cent of the luxury market worldwide', he believed that this left the brand vulnerable.

'Sometimes in your own market you can do things you can't do internationally. Here they love you, you are iconic, but in Paris you are  just one of many brands.'

An Italian fashion editor told me that while the British all know Mulberry, it has barely any profile in France or Italy. 'Italian women don't crave Mulberry bags.'

Intense, quirky Britishness could make the label seem provincial abroad. And coming from extremely expensive, deliberately exclusive Hermes, where the product - not the designer, let alone the customer - is the star, Guillon was unlikely to embrace Mulberry's ambassadors pottering round Glastonbury.

Guillon wanted Mulberry to compete with Dior, Prada and Vuitton. Put simply, he and Ong wanted to make more money.

So the prices went up. But bags that were a hit at under £700 - silly money, of course, but a price many British women would save up for - stopped selling when they went over £1,000.

A series of profit warnings followed. As one fashion editor said: 'Funnily enough, women who buy Mulberry don't want to be thought of as women who spend crazy amounts on bags. So even those who could afford them were put off by the snootier pricing.'

The City has taken a dim view of Hill's departure. The response of Luca Solca, managing director of luxury at investment company Exane BNP Paribas, is typical: 'Mulberry is trying to reposition itself to the high end . . . Mulberry in my view should be cheaper than Burberry and Gucci.

'There is little choice for handbags between £250 and £600. Market results indicate that Mulberry's upmarket ambitions are facing hurdles.'

In other words, Mulberry's price inflation is greed rather than good sense. No one thinks of it in the Prada or Hermes league - its appeal is something else altogether - and many think it unlikely that it ever will.

Mulberry's results today are forecast to see it report a 28 per cent drop in profits. And the share price that once reached £25 now stands at £9.40.

'Warm and fuzzy' are no longer the buzzwords at Mulberry. Let's hope a Parisian snob hasn't killed off the bags of fun.
