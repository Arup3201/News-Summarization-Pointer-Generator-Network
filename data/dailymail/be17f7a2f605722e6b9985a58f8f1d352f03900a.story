The always opinionated Rosie O'Donnell has come under fire for defending a statement made by another opinionated woman - Chrissy Teigen.

As the shooting in Canada's Parliament was underway Wednesday morning Teigen wrote on Twitter, 'Active shooting in Canada, or as we call it in America, Wednesday.' 

O'Donnell defended Teigen's statement as an astute observation on American gun culture, and when she did experienced some major backlash.

Good observation: Teigen wrote a tweet (above) meant to comment on the wide number of shootings that happen every day in the United States

Don't got her back: Even O'Donnell's co-hosts on The View (above) would not agree with her thoughts

'I thought it was brilliant and on-point, but some people thought it was insensitive,' O'Donnell said of Teigen's tweet Thursday morning on The View.

She also brought up the fact that many shootings are the result of mentally ill individuals getting their hands on guns, and not terrorism, something her co-host Nicole Wallace took her to task for.

'I know it's important to you that mental health is always raised as a possible, unaddressed cause. It's also possible that he was an evil terrorist, OK?' said the former adviser to failed vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin. 

'So I don't want that to get lost.' 

O'Donnell responded by bringing up the fact that 86 people a day are killed in America because of guns.

'I think she's saying: I'm an American, I live here. I see two people shot this week in Canada and the entire country of Canada is in mourning,' she explained. 

'However, in America this happens on a daily day basis and we don't even pay attention anymore.'

Backing up her thoughts: Teigen refused to back down after coming under fire on Twitter (above)

Sorting things out: A short while later she composed a tweet trying to explain her thoughts (above)

That's when the tweets started rolling in attacking the 52-year-old, who has never been shy about sharing her thoughts and beliefs.

'What Rosie said on the view today about Canada was not okay. Terrorists are terrorists and it's not just a typical shooting,' wrote Kylie Briggs on Twitter.

Angela Woodward said, 'I don't think someone attacks your president everyday Rosie O'Donnell. I've changed the channel today.' 

Even Teigen, 28, tried to explain what she was saying, writing after her first tweet, 'Sorry you don't understand that is a knock at america and our issues with gun control. No one is minimizing the Ottawa shooting.'

She also said of her statement, 'That's not a joke. It is a fact.'

Nice hubby: Teigen and her husband John Legend (above) recently celebrated their first anniversary

Horrific behavior: Earlier today Teigen signed off from Twitter (above) after receiving numerous death threats

The model and television host, who is married to singer John Legend, got it even worse than O'Donnell however, as the popular fixture on social media announced she was leaving Twitter following a barrage of death threats over her statement.

One person went so far as to write on Twitter, 'I hope someone murders someone you love, like your fa**ot husband.'

That seems to have been the final straw. 

'I feel sick. Bye Twitter. Taking my talents to Instagram,' wrote Teigen Thursday afternoon.
