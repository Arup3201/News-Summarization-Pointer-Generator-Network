Photography was the furthest thing from Holly Spring's mind when daughter Violet was struck down with a debilitating bowel condition that almost cost her her life.

Born with just one hand, her right, the new born 'went blue in the face' following surgical complications to correct a bowel condition known as Hirschprung's disease.

Clinging to life in an Auckland Hospital, it was at that this point her New Zealand mother realised just how incredibly important her daughter's fragile life was to her, so she began documenting it using digital photography.

Holly Spring wanted to show that her daughter could live a normal childhood through her work

Violet Spring, at just four, has had to endure a difficult upbringing due to her poor health

'Ive always been an artist, I'm in a rock band, but digital photography didn't come until after that close call,' the 38-year-old award winning photographer said.

Mrs Spring, whose daughter still lives with the debilitating condition despite surgery to remove a third of her bowel, does not know when Violet could relapse again and takes every day in her stride.

'At any time she might need more surgery or she could get a blockage...you just never know.'

Combined with an inability to use her left arm, Mrs Spring wanted to show through her work that the person she describes as her 'muse' and her 'heart’ was capable of living a normal, everyday childhood.

She said Violet was the reason she decided to dedicate a life to her new career, which she is now an award winner after claiming the 2014 New Zealand Portrait Creative Photographer of the Year.

'I realised I would have had no decent quality memories of her after that (possible death).

'So my husband bought me a camera, a  DSLR, and from that point on I started shooting her growing, and going from strength to strength.'

Many of Holly Spring's images show her daughter's left arm with the focal point centred on her right hand

Holly and Violet 'role play' certain scenes to capture the best image that brings out the four-year-old's exuberant personality

Holly was awarded the NZ Portrait Creative Photographer of the Year for 10 images she submitted of her daughter

Experimenting with different digital layers, colours and other new found skills she began role playing different scenarios with her four-year-old.

'I get her to look at things around her, the wondrous things that she sees and how she interacts with them.'

One of her favourite images - a shot of her daughter looking up at a Giraffe - was part of a compilation of 10 images that earned her her national photography award.

Using three individual photographs, Mrs Spring layered each of the images on top of another to create the stunning affect of her daughter playing with the long-necked animal.

On holiday, she shot an image of a stunning beach landscape, one of her daughter playing in the street and another of a giraffe at a zoo.

She said the most important subject matter in each of her images is her daughter.
