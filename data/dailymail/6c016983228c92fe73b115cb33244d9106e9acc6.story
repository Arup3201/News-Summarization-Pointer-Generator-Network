A mother-of-three who was fatally injured in a horse-riding accident, had been thrown from her trap after the pony was spooked by a herd of cows, an inquest heard.

Genevieve 'Gen' Palecek from Rushden, Northamptonshire suffered a fractured neck and 'unsurvivable' head injuries when she was hurled into a stone wall as the trap hit a tree. 

Before her tragic death, the 56-year-old had posted dozens of photos of herself riding her pony Martha on her Facebook page.

One picture shows Martha harnessed up to the trap which has an 'L' plate on it and the caption 'My clever girlie'.

Under another, Ms Palecek, a care home nurse, has commented: 'She actually prefers driving to being ridden. Martha is going so well, I just love taking her out.'

Friend Rebecca Storr told the inquest at Ampthill, Bedfordshire, how she had gone out with her friend for a ride round Podington, near Wellingborough, Northants, on July 14 last year.

As they trotted at walking speed towards a herd of cows mooing at them over a hedge, Ms Palecek joked: 'I don't know whether she is all right with cows.. But we'll find out in a minute.'

Rebecca said Ms Palecek then asked her to dismount from the trap just in case of problems because Martha, who was wearing blinkers, had 'stiffened up'.

The mother-of-two was a keen horsewoman and posted several pictured of herself in the saddle online

But as she stepped on to the road, the horse suddenly began kicking against the cart as if the cows had 'spooked' her.

Rebecca added: 'Then she reared up on her back legs and started galloping forwards. I started to run after the trap but couldn't keep up.

'As they neared a bend in the road, I could hear Gen shouting "Martha, Martha", but the horse reared right and Gen was thrown to the left. Then the trap was being dragged along on its side.

'By the time I reached Gen, who was still wearing a riding hat, she was lying unconscious on the ground and breathing shallowly.'

Ms Palecek was airlifted to University Hospital, Coventry, where doctors found she had 'unsurvivable injuries'.

As  there were no transplant teams free to remove her organs, relatives agreed that she should be kept alive until the next day.

Doctors kept Ms Palecek alive for another 24 hours so her liver and kidneys could be donated to other people.

Assistant coroner Ian Pears thanked her family for their thoughtfulness when he offered them his condolences at the inquest, recording a verdict of accidental death.
