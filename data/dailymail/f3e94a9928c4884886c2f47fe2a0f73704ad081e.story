It may be the most expensive water bottle in history.

A Chinese ceramic treasure whose design was modelled on ancient water flasks has sold today for £1.5 million - after staying hidden for a century in a Welsh mansion.

The stunning Imperial dragon moonflask was one of fewer than five commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor, who reigned from 1736 to 1795.

But the magnificent piece vanished about 100 years ago when, unknown to the wider world, it was bought in China by the wealthy shipping captain Charles Oswald Liddell.

This Imperial dragon moonflask, made for the Qianlong Emperor, has sold at auction for £1.5m after lying hidden in a Welsh mansion. Experts said it was one of the finest examples of Chinese ceramics in existence

He installed the flask at his 13-bedroom stately home, the Grade II listed Shirenewton Hall near Chepstow, Monmouthshire, where it remained a family treasure for a century.

Its whereabouts were only revealed when descendants of Capt Liddell, who was an avid collector of Oriental art and died in 1941, listed the flask for auction earlier this year.

The flask's sale was announced at about the same time Capt Liddell's former home also went on the market, with a guide price of nearly £4 million. It is no longer listed for sale.

Shirenewton Hall was heavily influenced by Capt Liddell's love of the Far East, with a Japanese garden and a pagoda roof which included a one-and-a-half-tonne bell.

The 12-inch artwork depicts a traditional 14th Century design of a flaming red Imperial dragon encircling a burning pearl, a sign of power in Chinese folklore.

It is among the most valuable of several pieces bought by Western collectors who seized upon the end of 2,000 years of Chinese Imperial power in the early 1900s.

This name 'moonflask' - 'baoyueping' or 'bianhu' in Chinese - refers to the ceramic work's large, round shape.

The flasks are also traditionally known as 'pilgrim's flasks' in the West, since they take their shape from a Middle Eastern prototype for water flasks which were carried by travellers.

It was sold today for £1,482,500, more than double its estimate of £500,000 to £800,000, to a collector from Hong Kong at auction house Bonhams.

Colin
Sheaf, head of the Chinese art department, said: 'The moonflask is
a superb example of porcelain created at the highest level of the 
potter's art for a sophisticated and demanding Imperial Court in Beijing.

'The appearance of this flask, unknown to collectors for nearly a century, is a very exciting event in the world of Chinese art.'

A distinguished connoisseur of ceramics in his own right, the Qianlong Emperor presided over one of the greatest collections of Chinese art.

Items from his collection are now among the most sought-after Chinese antiques in the world.

Asaph Hyman, Bonhams' director of Chinese art, said: 'This moonflask is extremely rare because of its intricate decoration which features several enamels and underglazes.

'With this technique it is very hard to get good results during the firing process and often one of the colours is not as strong as the other.

'But with this flask the colours are perfect and it is a piece fit for an emperor.

'Without doubt this flask would have been on display in one of the Imperial palaces.

'We know that Captain Liddell bought other vases from Li Hung Chang, a diplomat from the late Qing dynasty, so it is clear he was able to buy fine Imperial treasures.

'This moonflask is certainly one of the rarest vases of its type to come on the market.'

Emperor Qianlong loved all Chinese art

Emperor Qianlong was the sixth Emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty.

He reigned from October 1735 until February 1796 making him one of the country's longest serving emperors.

Qianlong, whose name means 'lasting eminence', was also considered one of the most enlightened of the emperors.

He was an enthusiastic patron of all forms of Chinese art and published catalogues of Royal collections which he expanded greatly.

The Emperor wrote thousands of poems in beautiful calligraphy, was a talented painter and commissioned many magnificent temples and palaces.

During his reign, Qianlong was determined to expand his empire and Tibet became a protectorate, Ili and Turkestan were conquered and Burma and the Nepalese Gurkas acknowledged Chinese suzerainty.

In the last decade of his reign, delegating decisions to others led to an increase in corruption and inefficiency in government.

He officially abdicated in favour of his son in 1796 so as not to rule longer than his grandfather, but ultimately reigned until his death two years later.
