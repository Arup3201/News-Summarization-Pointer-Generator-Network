Hull City boss Steve Bruce has confirmed his side are close to completing a club-record deal to sign Abel Hernandez from Palermo.

The Uruguay international flew in for talks ahead of his proposed £9.5million move to the KC Stadium on Wednesday after Bruce turned his attention to Hernandez after failing to convince Blackburn Rovers to sell Jordan Rhodes.

And it now appears Bruce has finally added a striker to his ranks after confirming the club have received a work permit for the 24-year-old.

Move in doubt: Hull could lose out in the race to sign Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley

'We expect the Hernandez deal to be completed before Monday's deadline,' said Bruce.

'We are just awaiting his signature. The work permit is already in.'

Bruce also revealed he is hoping to add 'one or two players' to his ranks - but admitted he is struggling to sign Manchester United's Tom Cleverley.

When asked if Hernandez was going to be the only signing on deadline day, Bruce replied: 'Never say never as we are still trying to do one or two bits. I can’t see us signing Cleverley. I don’t think it’s going to happen.'

Bruce has given George Boyd permission to hold talks with Premier League new boys Burnley and expects the forward to sign a long-term deal at Turf Moor.

'It looks like Boydy will go to Burnley. We allowed George to speak to Burnley and personally I wish him well.

'He got an offer of a three or four year contract at Burnley and the chance to play.

'But I've been in the game a long time and if all professional footballers were like George Boyd my job would be easy.'

Bruce also confirmed the signing of Cork City defender Brian Lenihan, although the 20-year-old is likely to go straight into the club's development squad rather than challenging for a first-team place. 

The 53-year-old was disappointed with his side's performance against Aston Villa on Sunday - labelling Hull's first-half display as the worst he has seen the Tigers play since he joined the club. 

'We gave ourselves such a mountain to climb, the first-half performance was arguably the worst I’ve seen us perform in my two years here. 

'Thankfully there was a response to that and we took the game to Villa in the second half. On another day we could’ve nicked something. I still can’t get over how bad we were in the first half because that was nowhere near our normal standard.

'I wont accept a performance where we were so lifeless - it was incredible. We were much better in the second half. It would’ve been a cricket score if we hadn’t woken up. We were that poor.

'I wish we could get them in on Monday but we can’t because 11 of our players are away on international duty. Mind you, they won’t be internationals if they keep playing like that.'
