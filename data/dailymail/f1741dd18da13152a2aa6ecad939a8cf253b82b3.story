Victory: Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin boss, has won control of the web address richardbranson.xxx, after wrestling it from an Australian man who registered it as a 'souvenir'

Sir Richard Branson, the Virgin boss, has won control of the web address richardbranson.xxx, after wrestling it from an Australian man who registered it as a 'souvenir.'

The multi-millionaire took Sean Truman to the National Arbitration Forum, a body based in the United States that rules on web address disputes.

It found that Mr Truman 'should have recognized that his registration and control of 'richardbranson.xxx' would serve to vex or embarrass' Sir Richard.

'Registering and holding a .xxx domain name identical to [Sir Richard’s] mark without having any rights or interests therein is evidence of bad faith registration and use,' it said in its ruling, reported The Telegraph.

The dispute began when brand owners were invited to block 
addresses based on their trademarks for a one-off fee, before .xxx 
opened for general registrations last year.

Decision: The .xxx designed as a internet home for porn sites, but the NAF found that because Mr Truman had no connection to the pornography industry that he 'impliedly admits in his papers that he has no rights in the domain name'

On December 10, just four days after the .xxx domains were released, Sean Truman picked up and registered 'richardbranson.xxx' for a few dollars.

He argued that he should be allowed to keep the address because the name Richard 
Branson was 'neither unique nor unusual' and that Sir Richard had had 'ample opportunity' to register the address himself.

The .xxx designed as a home for porn sites, but the NAF found that because Mr 
Truman had no connection to the pornography industry that he 'impliedly admits in his papers that he has no rights in the domain 
name.'

The address served up 'parking page 
with links to adult entertainment related websites', which Mr Truman 
made no money from, reported The Telegraph.

He protested that he had registered it simply as a 'souvenir.'

The NAF said Sir Richard had provided evidence he had common law,
although not registered, rights to the trademark 'Richard Branson.'

Under the rules of xxx, anyone 
registering an address and actually using it rather than just protecting
their trademark must be involved in the pornography industry.

But because Virgin is not a porn 
company, and therefore does not qualify to register .xxx domains, 
richardbranson.xxx will likely be set as a 'non-resolver' - it will not work when you type it in your browser address bars.

It is the second case to have been 
decided since .xxx first started selling domains last year - the first 
saw the domain heb.xxx transferred to a Texas-based grocery chain.

According
to records, other disputed addresses include foxstudios.xxx and 
kayjewelers.xxx and there have been 13 cases filed since 29 December.

Last March the.xxx domain 
was introduced after nearly a decade of debates by The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the 
organisation in charge of the web’s address system.

Pornography is often used to lure Web surfers to dangerous or fraudulent sites and through regulating .xxx, ICANN hoped to make things better.

Anyone who wants to register a .xxx domain has to go through an application process that's approved by the International Foundation for Online Responsibility.

The move gives consumers 'reassurance they are more protected from the risk of viruses, identity theft, credit card fraud and inadvertent exposure to child abuse images' ICANN said when announcing their decision last year.

Critics said established porn sites are unlikely to give up their .com domains just because there's a .xxx option and porn site operators are not forced to get .xxx domain names and go through the vetting process.

Nick Fox, a spokesman for Sir Richard, told The Telegraph: 'Virgin Group treats the use of its and Sir Richard’s name on the web very seriously and we ensure that there are no unauthorised sites operating that will confuse customers.

'ICANN has ordered the transfer of the richardbranson.xxx domain name to Virgin. We are pleased with the outcome of this dispute.'
