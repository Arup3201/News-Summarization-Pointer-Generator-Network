James Milner has taken part in the most deadpan Ice Bucket Challenge yet before nominating his Twitter parody account - Boring Milner.

With more than a hint of irony, the 28-year-old sat through the ordeal completely straight-faced, and followed his drenching with a thumbs-up.

The Manchester City midfielder nominated assistant coach Brian Kidd, Lucas Radebe and parody Twitter account @BoringMilner. 

Challenge: James Milner took part in the Ice Bucket Challenge with Scott Sinclair and Micah Richards

The online parody of the former Aston Villa midfielder has been around for a considerable stretch of time but came to the media's attention over the summer.

The identity of the person who runs the account is still unknown, though. Were they to accept the challenge, Milner may finally get some clues as to who the culprit is.

The England international speculated that it was somebody from inside Manchester City as some of the activities mentioned were accurate to the star's actual life.  

Deadpan: Milner remained calm throughout and only allowed himself a small smirk at the beginning

Nominated: Milner nominated Boring Milner, Lucas Radebe and Manchester City assistant coach Brian Kidd

Drenched: The 28-year-old midfielder gives the thumbs up after being soaked by Richards and Sinclair
