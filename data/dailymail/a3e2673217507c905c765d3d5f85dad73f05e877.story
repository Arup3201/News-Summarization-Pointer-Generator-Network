Team news:

England:

Roy Hodgson has a fully-fit squad to choose from, following a routine win against San Marino on Thursday. 

Adam Lallana and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain impressed during second-half cameos at Wembley, and will be pushing for starts on Sunday.

Fabian Delph was an unused substitute against San Marino as the midfielder missed training in the week, but he may feature against Estonia.

Hodgson, in his press conference, claimed it was simply 'just a case of minor knocks and tiredness, which is obviously going to come from playing 90 minutes and having the ball all of the time.' 

Squad: Forster, Foster, Hart, Baines, Cahill, Clyne, Gibbs, Chambers, Jagielka, Delph, Henderson, Lallana, Milner, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Shelvey, Sterling, Townsend, Wilshere, Lambert, Rooney, Welbeck

Estonia:

The home side will be without defender Ken Kallaste, who got sent off in Estonia's previous match, a defeat to Lithuania.  

Squad: Pareiko, Londak, Aksalu, Artjunin, Kallaste, Morozov, Barengrub, Kams, Kruglov, Klavan, Teniste, Jaager, Antonov, Mets, Lindpere, Vunk, Purje, Dmitrijev, Hunt, Ojamaa, Anier, Zenjov, Saag
