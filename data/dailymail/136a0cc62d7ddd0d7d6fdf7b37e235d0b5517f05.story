Our schools are simply not set up to accommodate very high proportions of children who start without fluent English.

The highly standardised curriculum continues to present a one-size-fits-all roadblock, preventing teachers from addressing pupils’ actual needs.

Having been a child who doesn’t speak the local language twice – in both a Greek and an Albanian school – as well being as a teacher in an East London primary school where many pupils did not speak English, I have seen both sides of the coin.

A former teacher and deputy director of the Civitas Think-Tank says schools cannot accommodate large numbers of non-English speakers 

In my Greek and Albanian schools, the focus was on learning the language before everything else. 

But when I was teaching a decade ago, children were not given the same level of support, and were often left to muddle along.

Some progress has been made since then, but trying to ‘press on’ and not address poor English is a lose-lose situation for everyone, including native English speakers.

The pupils who don’t receive opportunities to develop their language skills risk going through the education system with a major disadvantage. 

In turn, those who speak English can end up being neglected in classrooms where teachers are struggling to cope with weak language skills.

Whether you’re happy or unhappy with immigration levels, it’s a straightforward reality that many children in this country begin primary school speaking a different mother tongue.

Policymakers’ failure to properly address this is an extraordinary oversight. Ignoring English in schools simply makes no sense. 

For those championing the opportunities of immigrants, a strong command of English is imperative to making a successful life in this country. 

For those less embracing of multi-culturalism, a common language is crucial to help maintain a sense of unity. 

This country has never been very good at languages. But perhaps we could at least improve the command of our own.
