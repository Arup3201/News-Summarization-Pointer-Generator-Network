With Christmas barely out of the way, it might seem a bit soon to be thinking of a trip abroad.

But experts say this is the ideal time to plan a foreign holiday after travel agents began slashing the price of package trips yesterday and it emerged that a strong pound is giving tourists up to 28 per  cent more for their money than a year ago.

Operators are cutting the prices of deals to popular resorts in Turkey, Greece and Spain as competition begins during the peak selling season for holidays after Christmas.

Bargain breaks: Thomson is offering 14 nights in Florida for £1,119 per person - a saving of £670 per couple

When package prices, meal costs and 
exchange rates were assessed together for ten winter destinations in 
January, Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt came out top for value.

A week in the Red Sea resort costs just £399 – less than half of mid-haul competitor Jumeirah Beach, Dubai.

The strong pound also buys tourists around £55 per £500, or 12.5 per cent more in Sharm than during the same period last year.

The
 best value long-haul destinations include Orlando in Florida, Negril in
 Jamaica, and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, according to a 
survey for the Post Office.

Bali,
 in Indonesia, is the place to  go to get the most from the pound, with 
sterling up 28 per cent on  the weak rupiah – buying the equivalent of 
£108 more spending money for each £500 exchanged compared to 12 months 
ago. Cape Town  in South Africa is also great value, with tourists 
getting the equivalent of £91 more per £500 because of  the 20 per cent 
slump in the value of the rand.

A
 seven-night break, departing January 1 from London to Orlando in 
Florida costs £719, researchers said, while a holiday in Playa  del 
Carmen, in Mexico, was £899  and a seven-night stay in Dubai  was £983.

Most expensive of the resorts surveyed was Penang in Malaysia where the package costs as much £1,314.

Paul
 Havenhand, the head of travel at the Post Office, said: ‘Egypt’s  Red 
Sea resorts have always been a good value option but it’s not  just 
Sharm el-Sheikh where sun-seekers will find their pounds  stretch 
further.

‘Sterling buys 
more holiday cash in all ten of our January hotspots, with the biggest 
benefits to be found in Cape Town and Bali.’

January is prime selling season for holiday firms, with some cutting as much as £360 per person off short and long-haul breaks.

Thomas
 Cook has slashed seven nights in May at a four-star resort in Gran 
Canaria by £200 per person to £419. Thomson First Choice has 14 nights 
in Mauritius in May from £1,599 a head, saving £740 per couple.

The travel agency is also offering a seven night stay at a five-star resort in Belek, Turkey, for £1,769 which saves £320.

A seven night stay in Barbados has been cut by £442 to £1,159 per person.

However,
 British holidaymakers are expected to spend more on their annual 
getaway in 2014 rising to an average of £1,035 per person, a new study 
has found.

That will include £617 on the hotel and flights, and £459 in spending money.

A typical break will last 9.6 nights, staying in a Spanish beach resort, and self-catered accommodation.

Next year will also see a 14 per cent fall in the number of Brits opting for a staycation - a break within Britain.

Holidaymakers are more likely to jet off on long-haul flights, research by online comparison service Travel Supermarket shows.

Popular destinations will include the likes of U.S (7 per cent), and Turkey (3 per cent).

Spain continues to be the nation's favourite country in which to take a foreign holiday.

But the number of us who expect to be visiting will fall from 14 per cent this year to 12 per cent next.

Over a third of British holidaymakers (37 per cent) expect to spend more on their holiday in 2014.

In 2013 the total sum spent was 1,035 pounds, or 41 pounds less than 2014.

A
 quarter of those who plan to spend more (25 per cent) saved up for a 
nicer break, while 23 per cent cut back on last year's travels to afford
 it.

Almost four in ten Brits (39 per cent) took a beach holiday in 2013 but only 29 per cent plan to do the same for in 2014.

Instead, Brits are craving culture, history, shopping or entertainment.

Research shows city breaks were five per cent more popular in 2013 than they were in 2012 (35 per cent, 30 per cent).

Excluding those who have yet to decide, five per cent more holidaymakers plan on taking two or more breaks in 2014 compared to 2013 (70 per cent, 65 per cent).

A quarter are set to take exactly two holidays in 2014, which is the national average.

The summer months of June, July and August are by far the most popular months to travel in 2014.

Trips in June are potentially inspired by the FIFA World Cup, which kicks off on June 12 in Brazil.

A total of four per cent of Brits surveyed revealed they are going to a destination with a good atmosphere to watch the tournament.

While a further four per cent claim the World Cup might inspire them to go to Brazil one day.

The trend of people booking all-inclusive breaks in 2014 is set to rise by two per cent.

Nearly two in five single young professionals (39 per cent) want to have an adventure.

Those most tempted by a relaxing holiday are couples who do not plan to have children (73 per cent) and couples with grown up children (71 per cent).

Almost one in five families with young children go on holiday to experience new cultures (19 per cent), but the majority (67 per cent) claim that spending time with the family is their main motivation for traveling.

Bob Atkinson, travel expert from TravelSupermarket said: 'Spain has long been a favourite beach destination for Brits looking to unwind.

'It continues to offer great value in terms of affordable holidays and a reliable experience for holidaymakers.

'However it's great to see people having the confidence to try new, less traditional, holidays as they look to make the most of their time and money overseas.

'With economic signals indicating a slow but steady upturn in many countries, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria and Cyprus are emerging as popular holiday alternatives to the nation's favourite, Spain.

'Meanwhile, destinations such as Sri Lanka, Dubai, Florida, Cancun and Egypt are ideal for those looking at experiencing more long haul locations for their beach breaks.

'The fact that so many of us are keen to enjoy a city break demonstrates how keen we are to make use of the UK's proximity to exciting, and increasingly accessible cities across Europe.

Cities offering low cost of living such as Budapest, Tallinn, Vilnius and Riga, will continue to soar in popularity, but for those looking to splash more cash, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Las Vegas are all increasing in popularity as people travel for special occasions or for a treat.

'Regardless of where you choose to go, January will always be a key booking time for holidaymakers, so my advice will always be to think about what you want from your break and research your options via a price comparison website to help decide on the best holiday options for you.

'This way, you can book with confidence knowing you're getting the best value break possible.'
