Pastor Rick Warren has announced a new diet book that he has written combining nutritional tips and biblical lessons to help heavy congregants lose weight.

The pastor lost 65 pounds by sticking with a tailored diet plan in 2011 but then gained just over half of that back after his 27-year-old son killed himself earlier this year.

Warren, who heads a group of California megachurches, became a best-selling author with his book 1995 The Purpose Driven Life, but now he teamed up with a group of doctors to turn his focus towards congregants' physical health and created 'The Daniel Plan'.

Leading by example: Rick Warren said he had been gaining weight steadily for years (pictured at left in 2008 and right this October) but started actively dieting in 2011

'You think that God is only interested in your soul? No, he is interested in your body, mind and soul. Jesus went into each village teaching, preaching and healing. The Daniel Plan has to do with healing,' he told USA Today.

Helping hand: TV personality Dr Mehmet Oz is one of three doctors that helped Warren develop his diet

'The Bible says, "God made my body; Jesus died for my body; the spirit lives in my body." So I had better take care of it.'

Warren's book, which comes out tomorrow, suggests a five-pronged approach that tells followers to seek help with their diet through food, fitness, focus, faith and friends.

As with so much of his life, the diet's name is based off scripture: a chapter in the Bible tells how a Jewish noble named Daniel was tasked with eating healthy food as opposed to the rich diet of the king.

'We just took the title from that concept. It doesn't try to follow what Daniel ate, because the Bible doesn't tell us exactly what he ate,' Warren told USA Today.

'The line we use is: "If it grows on a plant, it's healthy. If it's made in a plant, don't eat it." My rule is no snacks, no sweets, no seconds.'

He first tried losing weight in conjunction with his congregants in 2010 after realizing that so many of them- himself included- were overweight. At the time, the 6-foot 3-inch preacher weighed 295 pounds.

He teamed up with Dr Mehmet Oz, Dr Daniel Amen and Dr Mark Hymen to develop the regime that helped him lose nearly a third of his body weight.

While the initial development of the 
diet started two years ago, he 'relapsed' this spring after his son 
Matthew killed himself.

Warren and his wife Kay spoke to CNN's Piers Morgan in a tell-all interview months later, opening up about his son's mental illness.

‘The
 day that I had feared might happen one day since he'd been born and the
 day that I had prayed would never happen, happened,’ he said in 
September.

Ailing: Warren lost 65 pounds in 2011 but this summer he gained half of that back following the suicide of his son Matthew, which he detailed in an interview alongside his wife Kay in September (pictured)

The grief that came after his son's death brought back at least 25 pounds.

'My back went out, and I wasn't able to exercise for an extended period. I didn't feel like doing anything, and our members who are so loving were bringing us meals every night. They weren't necessarily healthy meals. They were rich in creams and enormous portions, far more than we could possibly eat. It was comfort eating. I wasn't making some good choices in terms of what I ate,' he told USA Today.

'I didn't sleep well for months, and when you don't sleep well, your hunger level goes up. I fell off the wagon. All those pounds I had lost kept finding me.'
