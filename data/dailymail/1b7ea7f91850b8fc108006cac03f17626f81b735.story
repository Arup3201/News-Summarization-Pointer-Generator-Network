People who buy herbal supplements over the internet could be putting themselves at risk because many do not contain ingredients listed on the labels and may include unknown herbs and even metal, a researcher has warned.

Graham Lord, Director of NIHR Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, said people who order herbal supplements online could end up taking contaminated products as well as toxic combinations of herbs which could lead to health problems and even kidney and liver failure.

He said supplements produced in the EU - despite being subject to much tougher regulations than the rest of the world  - can still contain hundreds of unknown plant compounds which could be harmful.

Experts are warning people about the dangers of buying herbals supplements over the internet, which could be contaminated with other harmful herbal combinations or in some cases even extracts of metal 

The warning follows an investigation in America which found four out of five herbal supplements such as echinacea and ginseng for sale in some stores were contaminated or had been completely substituted by other herbs.

Experts said it was possible the same could happen in the UK - particularly with products ordered online - and are calling for the test to be repeated here. 

'The real risk is that products ordered over the internet are potentially dangerous because they are not regulated,' said Prof Lord. 

'The assumption that if something is natural it is healthy is wrong, you don't really know what you are taking sometimes.'

Tighter regulations were introduced in the EU in 2004 governing the production of herbal supplements, making these products some of the safest in the world.

But Prof Lord said even more stringent controls do not go far enough and unknown compounds contained in plants could still be present in these products. He said the only way to make them completely safe was to subject herbal remedies to the same type of testing as medicines, but this would involve major changes. 

He added: 'It all stems from the fact that herbal products are not regulated in the same way as medicines. If you are given a prescription drug this will have been very precisely regulated and gone through clinical trials. With herbal remedies, they don't go through that kind of control. 

'There can be hundreds of different compounds in there and it is very hard to tell.'

However, he said the greatest risk was with taking items ordered over the internet which if they are not produced in the EU can be subject to very little controls. 

He added: 'Particular herbs might get in during production and there have been cases of metal that can get in as a contaminant during the production process. 

'There can be quite serious implications of taking the wrong herbs. The most obvious dangers are kidney disease and kidney cancer. 

Researchers are calling for a study in America, which found some herbal supplements contain little or no of the products they should, to be copied in the UK

'There are some, rare, but very serious health outcomes.' 

Michael Heimlich, a professor at Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy at the University College London, agreed there was a risk unregulated herbal products in the UK could be contaminated with other substances.

During his research he has found examples where chemicals have been used to replace certain plant extracts or plants from different species have been substituted. 

Prof Heinrich said in a current study of roseroot or Rhodiola rosea they found that at least 20 per cent of the samples do not contain it, but other Rhodiola species or a synthetic compound commonly used in food supplements. Some compounds have also been found to contain amino acids commonly used by body builders.

He said: 'There are examples of chemicals replacing the plant extracts, low dose products, adulteration with related, but chemically different species.

'Consumers should only use products which are of good quality and especially products registered under the traditional herbal remedies scheme which must demonstrate that they are safe and of acceptable quality, including adherence to good agricultural and collection practices and good manufacturing practice (GMP). And, if in doubt, they should consult their pharmacist.'

The traditional herbal remedies scheme was introduced in 2011 and means herbal products such as St John's Wort and echniacea must be registered with the MHRA. Registration does not mean herbal remedies have been tested and proven to work, but that it has been produced to good quality standards. 

An investigation in America used DNA barcoding technology to test six herbal supplements sold in New York. It found that only 21 per cent of the products tested contained the DNA of the plants listed on their labels.  

A study into roseroot, or Rhodiola rosea, available on the internet found that 20 per cent of samples do not contain it and some had even been contaminated with extracts from chemicals used by bodybuilders 

A spokesman for the MHRA said:'These products are sold in the US as botanical food supplements and are not regulated as herbal medicinal products. The situation in the UK is different.

Where herbals products are considered to be herbal medicinal products they will either hold a full product licence or a traditional herbal registration. 

'The products are regulated by MHRA and the products are manufactured in accordance with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice). Companies have to submit documentation to support the quality of their products and this is assessed before products can be placed on the market.'
