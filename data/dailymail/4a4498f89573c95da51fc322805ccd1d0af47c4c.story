Making the menu: Brits are more likely to order snails on their travels as attitudes to foods change

Brits abroad have bucked the trend of turning their noses up at local food - with snails, frogs legs and even snake on their holiday menu.

Not so many years ago Brits had a reputation for running a mile at the thought of 'foreign muck' - many even taking their own tea bags and favourite foods away with them.

But researchers have found Brits are far more likely to try new types of food when abroad than when they are at home.

Respondents also identified food markets 
as a 'must visit' on their trips away, many stating that they have taken inspiration 
from celebrity chefs such as Rick Stein and The Hairy Bikers to pick up 
foodie ideas and ingredients to take home.

The study also discovered that many Brits are now looking towards foreign shores to inspire their own dinner parties and fuel the ‘Come Dine With Me’ culture.

The poll of more than 960 people by Viking River Cruises found the majority of Brits (97 per cent) are likely to be more adventurous with their food when on holiday than when they are back home.

And three out of four Brits (77 per cent) try to recreate their favourite foreign dishes when they return to UK shores.

The most popular dishes Brits tried for the first time when overseas include snails (six per cent) and frogs (five per cent). 

The survey also unearthed the more 
unusual items eaten by Brits abroad included sheep’s brain, cherry soup 
and one person admitted eating bees while on holiday.

While ostrich, birds nest soup and even guinea pig aren’t unlikely to make the menu, we’re trying to impress friends with our culinary creations more than ever before, taking inspiration from our travels.

Wendy Atkin-Smith, managing director of Viking River Cruises UK, said: 'When we arrive on holiday we automatically feel a sense of adventure and this seems to be transferred onto our palette.

'The traditional dinner party is back in fashion and we are now looking to impress with international dishes rather than the traditional meat and two veg. '
