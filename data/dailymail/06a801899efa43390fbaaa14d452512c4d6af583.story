Team news

Manchester City

Manchester City midfielder James Milner will miss Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash against Newcastle with a knee injury.

The England international has taken a kick on a ligament and will be assessed prior to Tuesday's Champions League encounter with Barcelona.

New signing Wilfried Bony, the £25million striker, could make his debut while midfielder Yaya Toure is also available after the African Nations Cup. Top scorer Sergio Aguero is fit after a slight back issue at Stoke last week.

Newcastle

Newcastle head for Manchester City on Saturday with their defensive resources stretched to the limit by injury.

Left-back Paul Dummett (knee) is facing up to 12 weeks on the sidelines alongside long-term casualty Steven Taylor (Achilles), leaving head coach John Carver with just four fit senior defenders, Daryl Janmaat, Mike Williamson, Fabricio Coloccini and Massadio Haidara.
