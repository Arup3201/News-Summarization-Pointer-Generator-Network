Dr Alex Moulton CBE, the ledgendary British engineer who pioneered the small wheel bicycle and built the suspension system in the Mini has died aged 92.

Dr Moulton specialised in suspension design and his bicycle is 
recognised as a 'design classic' by industrial designer Sir James Dyson.

His pioneering work also revolutionised the suspension system of 
British cars, and was one of the key reasons the Mini is so small.

Dr. Moulton's revolutionary small-wheeled, full-suspension Moulton bicycle was unique.

It proved popular among commuters as it has suspension, which uses rubber and can be easily taken apart for transport.

The design uses a 'F' design, and can be seperated easily so commuters can stow it in a boot.The bicycle is still built by hand in Bradford on Avon by a loyal team of engineers, technicians and craftsmen overseen by general manager and Alex's nephew Shaun Moulton.

His death was announced on the website of the Mouton Bicycle Company, which still handmakes and sells bikes based on his iconic design.

'It is with great sorrow that Shaun Moulton and The Moulton Bicycle Company announce the news that Dr. Alexander Eric Moulton CBE, distinguished engineer and inventor, passed away peacefully in the company of his family and staff on Sunday evening, 9th December 2012, at the age of 92.

'Dr. Moulton was an inspiration for generations of engineers, designers and inventors,' it says.

'Educated at Marlborough and Cambridge, Alex Moulton worked at Bristol Aeroplanes as assistant to Sir Roy Fedden during WW2.

'He joined Bradford on Avon rubber manufacturers Spencer Moulton in 1945, leading a new research team.

'His collaboration with Sir Alec Issigonis resulted in Moulton suspension, including ‘Hydrolastic’ and ‘Hydragas’ systems, being employed in over twelve million British cars from the original Mini to the MGF.'

The Moulton led to a cycling revolution in the 60s. Here, Fashion models June Fry, Jill Wright and Jenny Wilson, wearing tweed trouser suits and posing in a pedestrian street with a Moulton deluxe city bicycle on 8th September 1964

The great-grandson of rubber pioneer Stephen Moulton, Dr Moulton was educated at Marlborough and later at King's College, Cambridge where he graduated in engineering.

In the late 1950s, he worked with Sir Alec Issigonis - the man who designed the Mini - to create a suspension system which allowed the car's overall small size.

Sir James Dyson, inventor and entrepreneur.

'The most extraordinary thing about Alex Moulton was that he was a designer and an engineer who invented two of the most iconic products of our age: the wheels and suspension for the mini, and the Moulton bicycle.

'I first met Alex as a student in the sixties.

'What immediately struck me was that he was someone who put engineering first and yet still considered the whole product.

'That perspective has helped guide me throughout my career.

'Over the years, we regularly met for dinner to discuss our products and engineering difficulties -  He was an inspiration to me.

'Without having met Alex, I would not have had the courage to be both a designer and an engineer.

'The interesting thing about Alex was that he stuck to suspension and bicycles, two finite fields in which he became a world expert.

'Through iterative development, he created the most extraordinary, unusual products culminating in the beautifully thin stainless steel space frame bicycle.

'I think it is an important lesson to learn that sticking to one thing and reinventing yourself leads to a place that no one else can ever get to.'

It was a huge success, and was used in later cars, including the MGF.

However, he was best known for his bicycle, which was unveiled at the 1962 Earls Court Cycle Show.

Dr
Moulton said the unique design, was 'born out of my resolve to 
challenge and improve upon the classic bicycle, with its diamond frame 
and large wheels, which has locked bicycle design into that form since 
the pioneering work in England of Starley and others at the end of the 
19th Century.'

At events 
held to marks the 50th anniversary of the design last month, Lord Norman
Foster hailed it as an icon "synonymous with the Mini, the mini-skirt -
the mini bike.

The Moulton family were originally law stationers in London, and Stephen Moulton became involved in the rubber business more by accident than design.

He acquired a licence to manufacture vulcanised rubber from the American Charles Goodyear, with a view to selling it on and making a profit on the transaction.

When he hawked round his licence, however, the British rubber industry was unmoved, so eventually he went into the business himself.

Sir James Dyson paid tribute to Dr Moulton for setting a 'good example to our [Dyson] engineers'.

The design also sparked a revolution in cycling in London in the 60s, and according to the firm 'all of today's small wheeled cycles owe a debt of gratitude to the original Moulton 'F' frame design which not only introduced and proved the concept of full-size bicycles with small wheels, but also, right from launch in 1962, have utilised front and rear suspension systems for improved comfort and performance.'

The firm is still hugely popular, and several cycle clubs who ride only its designs exist.
