Most people probably would like to assume that if they were awoken at 6:30 in the morning by a drunk, naked stranger in their bedroom - who'd just smeared his own feces throughout their house and tried to flood their kitchen - that the intoxicated intruder would be arrested when police ultimately show up.

That, however, was not the case for a couple in Kuma, Idaho, who say that exact scenario played out in their home earlier this month - in their case, they say responding officers didn't arrest the drunken poop-smearer, they only cited him for a misdemeanor and let him go home. 

As if that wasn't enough, homeowners Tricia and Jake Gillaspy had just moved into the home a week prior to the alleged fecal-artist's predawn intrusion.

Shocked: Tricia and Jake Gillaspy were stunned to find Matthew Coomes naked in their bedroom at 6:30 am

Crappy situation: After chasing Coomes out of the house at gunpoint, the couple found feces ground into their carpet

The incident occurred in the early hours of June 15 - Father's Day - when the Gillaspys awoke to find the drunken man standing in their bedroom at 6:30 a.m.

'My husband's like, "What the heck is going on?" And, I'm screaming in utter panic,' Tricia Gillaspy tells KTVB.

The intruder, later identified as 25-year-old Matthew Coomes, had clearly been drinking.

The couple says that after a naked Coomes had woken them up, he tried to run into another room and put some clothes on.

'My husband grabs the gun because we have no idea who this guy is,' said
 Tricia. 'He's like, "Get out of my house, now!" But the guy wouldn't 
leave. So, he puts the gun to his head, and says, "I said, get out!'

'[Jake Gillaspy called 9-1-1 and] He's like, "There's a guy in my house. I'm going to shoot him, you better get a cop here now,'" she said.

Coomes eventually left the house, but remained on the couple's property until police arrived. That's when the couple discovered what Coomes allegedly had been doing prior to his waking them up.

'He took this sink sprayer out and this drawer was in there. He put it 
in the drawer, turned it on full blast hot water, it filled that entire 
drawer full. It flooded my entire kitchen,' said Tricia. 'He craps on my
 floor, and he must have been playing in it because he streaked it down 
the side of my walls. The stain is gone finally, thank goodness.'

When police arrived, rather than arrest the drunk, naked man who had just terrified an innocent couple, the responding officers cited Coomes for the misdemeanors and took him back to his house.

'I go running out the door, and am like, "What are you doing!?" I'm like, 'This guy deserves to go to jail!'" Gillaspy said.

Tricia says she later learned that the damage allegedly caused by Coomes cost more than $5,000 to repair.

In the following days, Tricia received a call from a Kuna Police sergeant who told her the officers should have arrested Coomes on the spot.

The Kuna Police Department says it is conducting an internal investigation into why Coomes was not arrested the morning of the incident. Additionally, prosecutors have since filed felony charges against Coomes for malicious injury to property for the extensive - and expensive - damage he did to the home. 

Investigators say it appears Coones entered the home through an unlocked backdoor. He later told police that he didn't remember going into the home or using the sprayer in the kitchen. Additionally, he says he also doesn't recall how his feces ended up on the Gillaspys carpet and how his underwear ended up on their floor.
