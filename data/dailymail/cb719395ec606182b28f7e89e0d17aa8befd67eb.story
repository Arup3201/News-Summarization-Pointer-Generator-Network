MPs are packing their bags for a 20-day break because Parliament has run out things to debate.

The Commons and the Lords will not sit again until the Queen’s Speech on June 4, sparking claims of a ‘zombie Parliament’.

There are also concerns that because Parliament does not really exist during prorogation it cannot be recalled in the event of a national emergency, or an escalation of tensions in Ukraine.

MPs gathered for Prime Minister's Questions today, the last session until the Queen's Speech in June 4

It had been thought that Parliament would break next week, but at the weekend it emerged ministers were preparing to prorogue on Thursday night.

However, with no new laws to debate the constitutional procedure of proroguing Parliament - involving tricorn hats and Norman French – will take place tonight.

Labour MP Chris Bryant said: ‘It is daft to prorogue today. Parliament will not be able to be summoned, in any event at all, until 4 June.’

Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle told the BBC: ‘It does feel a bit like it’s the undead running around at the moment.

‘What they ought to be doing is they should have had a proper legislative programme for five years.

‘They’ve had five years to know that that’s where they were going to be and instead we’ve seen a government running out of steam, running out of ideas, keeping Parliament ticking over because they can’t think of things to do. It’s not showing the right level of respect to Parliament.’

However the government has rejected the idea that it has run out of policies.

Tory minister Andrew Lansley said: ‘It's always the case every year that once we've completed the business that has been set down for a particular session, so that once the government bills and other bills have complete their passage, then Parliament rises and there is what is called 'prorogation', which is the gap before the start of the new session.

At around 7pm, Leader of the Lords Lord Hill will read a message from the Queen to begin proroguing Parliament.

Recalling MPs in the event of an emergency is very difficult and would require a Royal Warrant.

Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday warned MPs it would be ‘unprecedented’ and could only happen in "extreme circumstances if there is a threat to the United Kingdom".

Embarrassingly MPs have only been back in Westminster for eight days since they returned from a 17-day Easter recess.

They also had nine days off in mid-February for a half term break, which came only four and a half weeks after their Christmas break which last from December 19 to January 6.
