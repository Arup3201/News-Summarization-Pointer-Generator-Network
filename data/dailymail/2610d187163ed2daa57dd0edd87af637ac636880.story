Expelled: Pupil Leonarda Dibrani was detained on a schoolbus and told to leave France along with the rest of her family

A 15-year-old girl who was detained on a schoolbus and expelled from France has turned down an offer to return to the country - unless the rest of her family can come with her.

Earlier this week Leonarda Dibrani was detained by police as she got off a bus 
from a school trip.

The schoolgirl was then expelled from France along with the rest of her family, who entered the country illegally in 2009.

Today president Francois Hollande spoke on national television to say the girl could return to France to study - but her family must remain in Kosovo where they are being persecuted for being Roma.

Leonarda refused the offer - and accused Hollande of having 'no heart'.

The unusual case has caused outrage across the country - with some left-wing and green politicians comparing the incident to the roundups of Jews under Nazi occupation.

The story has since become more 
complicated, with the girl's father admitting he lied in his asylum 
application when he said the entire family fled Kosovo, where they were 
persecuted for being Roma, or gypsies.

Leonarda, and most of her 
siblings, were born in Italy, though they do not have Italian 
citizenship.

A government 
report found that the police followed the law, although 
the report said they didn't seem to realise the sensitivity of what they
were doing.

Hollande went today tried to walk the line between maintaining a tough stance on illegal immigrants and showing compassion for the girl caught up in the storm.

He said Leonarda, considering the circumstances of her detention, could come back to France to go to school, if she wishes. But only she can come back.

He said: 'She will be welcomed back, and her alone.'

In Mitrovica, Kosovo, where the family is now living, Leonarda told reporters she would not come back without her family. Her father threatened to return to France, even if it was illegal.

She said: 'Mr Hollande has no heart for my family? He has no pity?'

She had earlier said that she was deeply ashamed when the police took her away in front of her classmates.

Her words come as police in Kosovo say the girls parents, Resat and Dzemila Dibrani, were accosted Sunday by another Roma couple.

Dzemila, who was briefly hospitalized before being discharged, sustained unspecified injuries when the Roma man inquired about the fate of a child from their past romance, a Kosovo official said on condition of anonymity. Both couples are being questioned by police.

In his broadcast Hollande also said local authorities would be told that, from now on, no such detentions can happen while children are in the care of their schools, whether inside the building, at the exit, on a bus or in after-school activities.

Although polls show that the majority of French people don't think the family should be allowed to return to France, some say the case has threatened to destabilise the Hollande government.

Thousands of teenagers rallied in central Paris on Friday after shutting down their high schools the day before to protest against expulsions like Leonarda's.
