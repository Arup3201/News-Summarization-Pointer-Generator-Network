British women enjoy fewer years in retirement than those in most other Western nations, a study has revealed.

Shorter lifespans and longer working lives mean a British woman can expect 22.1 years in retirement – five fewer than the 27.4 enjoyed by French women.

Experts say the gap is only going to increase due to the Government’s determination to raise the state pension age.

Widening gap: Retirement is shorter for British women - and men - than those who live in many other developed countries

The study, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, shows that men in the UK fare slightly better when compared with other rich nations.

But they can still expect a retirement lasting just 19.1 years – three and a half years shorter than their French counterparts.

The retirement span of British men is slightly above the average for the OECD, which represents the top 34 industrialised countries.

British women are in 22nd position, under the OECD average and below five countries which used to be behind the Iron Curtain.

The study, Society at a Glance 2014, found that while life expectancy has surged in Britain over the past four decades, the rate is slower than it is for many of our competitors.

Life expectancy has risen by 9.2 years since 1970 in the UK but in France it has gone up by 10 years and in Germany, 10.2.

The study warns that the taxpayer will come under increasing pressure to support its older generation. In Britain, there are 3.5 working-age people per pensioner but by 2050 that will be just 2.2.

Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser, said: ‘British women are poor relations on pensions both here and in Europe – and it is only going to get worse.

‘With the retirement age rising significantly, the differential in retirement span between British women and European women here is only going to widen.

‘On top of this, state pensions for women are much lower in Britain than elsewhere.’

The OECD report shows that British women tend to retire at the age of 63.2, by which time their life expectancy is 85.3. This gives them a retirement span of 22.1 years.

Across the OECD, the average retirement span is 22.5 years.

But French women tend to retire at 60, by which time their life expectancy is 87.4, giving them a retirement span of 27.4 years.

Even former Soviet bloc states such as Slovenia, Czech Republic and Slovakia fare better than us, as does Ireland.

British men tend to retire at the age of 63.7, by which time they have a life expectancy of 82.8, giving them a retirement span of 19.1 years – three fewer than women.

France, again, does much better, with a retirement span of 22.6 years. Top of the male league is Luxembourg with a span of 23.4 years.

But British men have longer retirements than the OECD average of 18.1 years.

Across the OECD, women tend to have 7.5 extra years in retirement than they did in 1970, while men have eight more years.

Mrs Altmann said: ‘Women in Britain are now working later because of the increase in state pension age and also, it is important to point out, because some like to earn the extra money.

‘This is not happening in some European countries but it is likely the state pension system and retirement ages there will turn out to be unsustainable.’
