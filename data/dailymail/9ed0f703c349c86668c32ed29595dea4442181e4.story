Former Vice President Walter Mondale, 87, is 'doing well' and is home after he was hospitalized with the flu on Friday. 

Mondale was supposed to introduce former President Jimmy Carter Friday at the annual Nobel Peace Prize Forum, but he had to cancel.  

During Carter's speech in Minneapolis, he said that he had talked with Mondale, who was being treated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

'He went there just for a regular physical examination but had a fever, and they finally said that he has influenza,' Carter said, according to NBC. 'He's in bed at the moment, but looking forward to come back home.' 

Mayo Clinic spokeswoman Kelley Luckstein told NBC that Mondale was 'doing well'. She said he was 'treated for flu and cold symptoms and is headed home.' 

Mondale's wife died on February 4, aged 83, after a long illness. The couple was married for 58 years.

The former Vice President served under Carter from 1977 to 1981.

Mondale has also served as a U.S. senator representing Minnesota and as an ambassador for Japan.
