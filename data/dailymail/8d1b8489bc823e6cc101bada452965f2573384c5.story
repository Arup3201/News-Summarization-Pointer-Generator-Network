Accused: Ben Blakeley is on trial for allegedly murdering his ex-girlfriend Jayden Parkinson

A man accused of murdering his ex-girlfriend told a prison nurse that he was 'a celebrity' after the killing and wanted to watch himself on TV news, a court heard today.

Ben Blakeley, 22, was 'laughing and jovial' when he allegedly made the comment about the death of 17-year-old Jayden Parkinson while being held at HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire.

Blakeley also wrote a letter confessing to killing Jayden and said he 'deserved 30 years' for what he had done, the trial at Oxford Crown Court was told.

The former binman, from Reading, Berkshire, is accused of murdering Jayden a day after she told him she was pregnant with his child.

She was last seen alive with Blakeley on the afternoon of December 3 last year in Didcot, Oxfordshire after meeting him to discuss her pregnancy.

Blakeley, who denies murder but admits manslaughter, dumped Jayden's body in the grave of his uncle at All Saints' graveyard in Didcot a week after killing her.

Cally Brinsley, a senior nurse in HMP Bullingdon's health unit, said Blakeley had repeatedly asked for a television in his cell.

'He wanted to see what was going on with the case and seeing himself on the television,' she told jurors.

'He was very jovial in his behaviour. He would answer a question from me and, if he provided the correct answer, he would say "Can I have a television now please?" He did shout down the corridor at me "I'm a celebrity now, miss".'

At this point in the nurse's evidence, Blakeley jumped up from his seat in the dock, swore and shouted: 'How can you say stuff like this?'. He then asked to leave the court and the trial continued in his absence.

Ms Brinsley was asked about Blakeley's demeanour when he made the 'celebrity' comment and she replied: 'Jovial... he was laughing.'

She told jurors that staff were not allowed to discuss legal matters with prisoners but, during a review of his health, he told her about Jayden's death.

She said: 'He did say to me "I told them where the shovels were. I got really drunk. I didn't want it to happen. If I could take it back I would".

'I told Ben to stop because I didn't want to hear what had happened and I was there as a nurse and I was there for his welfare.

'Ben said "Can I have a television now?" as if he had given me some information and he wanted to have a reward. I told him that he couldn't.''

Ms Brinsley said on another occasion Blakeley asked her whether police had found Jayden's body.

'He was in quite an excitable state, as if he was expecting exciting news and then asked about the television once again, which was his main priority,' she told the court.

She also said that Blakeley had been issued with a Bible while on remand and inside the back cover, prison officers later discovered, was written: 'RIP baby. I will miss you always. I am sorry xxx. I am sorry, sorry.'

There was also a heart drawn on the page with the letters 'J' and 'B' inside it, the jury was told. Also found in the Bible were two newspaper cuttings, with one headlined: 'Jayden mother's nightmare.'

The other article was about the police searching for Jayden's body and included photographs of a tent erected over a grave at All Saints' graveyard.

The court also heard a statement from prison governor Carol Gaskin who said she had been handed a letter from Blakeley on December 19 last year.

She said: 'He said "I want to give you this and it needs to go to the police". I asked what that was and Ben replied: "That's my confession". Ben said he had done everything he could to try and save her.'

In another statement read out in court, prison officer Carly Roffey said she was on duty on December 20 when 'Ben said he deserved to get 30 years for what he had done but that was not worth her life'.

She added: 'He said he had now come to terms with what he had done and would accept any punishment he got. He also told me that he had written a confession.'

Health care assistant Tracey Howarth told jurors of a meeting she and other staff members had with Blakeley two days before Christmas last year.

She told the court: 'He just said that he wanted us to know that he hadn't just dropped her in a hole he had dug.

'He told me "I didn't mean to kill her" and he hadn't meant it to happen. He was grinning like he thought it was funny, (he) didn't appear to take it seriously.'

Blakeley denies murdering Jayden but admits her manslaughter and attempting to pervert the course of justice over the disposal of her body.

The prosecution has refused to accept his manslaughter plea and he has gone on trial alongside a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.

The youth has also pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice but denies a charge of preventing a lawful burial because he says he did not know he was helping bury Jayden's body.
