If you want a real fright this Halloween, take a look at these glowing zombies crawling out of the ground in front of trembling passers-by.

The creepy undead figures have been carved out of giant pumpkins at New York's Botanical Gardens.

An upright zombie pulls his decaying friend out of the ground in this terrifying display at the Haunted Pumpkin Garden.

The scary sculptures are part of a month of haunted horrors at the gardens, with families jumping out of their skin at chilling sights including the biggest bat in the world and the Gigantic Flying Fox of Malaysia.

Visitors will also be able to take a masterclass and learn to craft their own ghoulish gourds.

Each petrifying pumpkin was hand-carved by master carver
Ray Villafane, of Food Network fame, and his team - Andy Bergholtz (a 
current contestant on Food Network's Halloween Wars), Trevor Grove, 
Alfred Paredes and Chris Vierra.

Members of the Great Pumpkin Commonwealth will also be on hand to talk about their passion for growing the gargantuan gourds.

Brave souls will be able to follow up their lesson in the ways of the undead with a spooky forest walk.

This year has seen a bumper pumpkin harvest, despite an early drought, with some already smashing weight records.

The latest champion to visit the garden is a 2009-pound behemoth, which took the title for grower Ron Wallace on September 28 in Massachusetts.

There are at least two weeks left on the weigh-in schedule, which means another pumpkin might sneak up on us to produce a surprise win.
