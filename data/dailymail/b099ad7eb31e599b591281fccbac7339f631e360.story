Saturday is the day when love of math and a hankering for pastry come full circle.  

The date is 3-14-15, the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi: 3.141592653.

The best times to celebrate are at 9:26 and 53 seconds, morning and evening, and the occurence won't happen again until March 2115. 

On Saturday the date is 3-14-15, the first five digits of the mathematical constant pi: 3.141592653.

Pi Day is celebrated on March 14th (3/14) around the world. Pi (Greek letter “π”) is the symbol used in mathematics to represent a constant — the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter — which is approximately 3.14159. 

'It's a portal into this magical mysterious world of mathematics,' said University of California Berkeley mathematician and author Edward Frenkel. 'Pi is special.'

Pi is the constant used to calculate the area of a circle, as in pi times the radius squared, but it appears all over other parts of mathematics. It 'is kind of a basic atomic building block' for math, said Temple University mathematician and author John Paulos, who was interviewed at precisely 3:14:15 p.m.

In some places, Pi Day is celebrated with the edible type of pie.

'It's a real exciting moment for math enthusiasm,' said Nathan Kaplan, a Yale University math professor, who called it a time for people to 'remember how much fun they found some of the stuff in school.'

Kaplan acknowledged that most people don't really recall math as fun, blaming that on how it's taught: 'There's fun stuff out there in the quantitative world.'

One interesting aspect of pi is that it is irrational, which means the decimals after 3 go on to infinity with no repeating patterns. Yet in 1897, a bill before the Indiana legislature tried to round it up to 3.2. It fell flat.

'We cannot change it. It's not subject to opinion or taste or time,' Frenkel said. 

'How many things like this in the universe mean the same thing to everyone through time and space?'

This pi story goes full circle, with exactly 314 words.

In honor of mathematical constant's designated day, MIT will be announcing its 'Regular Action' admissions on March 14, 2015 at 9:26 a.m. ET. Celebrating Pi Day isn't new for the prestigious college, but this year is extra special, as the date aligns perfectly with Pi's first eight numbers: 3.1415926. 

Pi has been calculated to over one trillion digits beyond its decimal point.

As an irrational and transcendental number, it will continue infinitely without repetition or pattern.

While only a handful of digits are needed for typical calculations, Pi’s infinite nature makes it a fun challenge to memorize, and to computationally calculate more and more digits.
