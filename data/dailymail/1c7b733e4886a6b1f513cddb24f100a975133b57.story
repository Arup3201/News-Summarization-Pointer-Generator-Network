Nothing says Australian like green and gold and Streets are hoping that patriotic Aussies will lap up its new 'Green & Golden' varieties of the Golden Gaytime and Paddle Pop ice creams.

The move is a celebration of 80 years of Aussie Summers under Streets Ice Cream, which began when Edwin Street began selling ice cream from his shop in Corrimal, NSW, in the early 1920s.

It's not the first time that Streets has mixed up its ice cream offer. Over the years, there have been over 20 different flavours of the Gaytime ice cream, including Strawberry Shortcake, Raspberry Rough, and Turkish Delight.

Paddle Pop is among the most recognised Australian brands and is sold in over 20 different countries.

Streets Marketing Director, Anthony Toovey said the Aussie themed ice creams were designed to remind people that Streets Ice Creams are about the Aussie summer time and having fun.

'We couldn't think of a better way to celebrate our 80th summer than with ice creams that say we are proudly Australian - green and gold through and through' said Mr Toovey. 

Limited edition Green & Golden Gaytime and Paddle Pop Aussie Rainbow are available now.

SInce its launch there have been 20 different versions of the Golden Gaytime ice cream.
