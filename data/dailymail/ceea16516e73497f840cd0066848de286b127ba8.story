Lengthy applause is seen as the ultimate mark of approval on a performance.

But rather than showing we like what we see, researchers believe the length of time we clap is closely linked to peer pressure.

Once one person starts clapping it spreads like an ‘infection’ spreading from one person to another - with the crowd ‘instinctively’ responding to the noise.

Crowds continue to clap following a performance until someone is brave, tired or bored enough to stop and the volume of applause starts dropping, according to researchers.

Lead researcher Dr Richard Mann, from Uppsala University in Sweden, said: ‘Once someone has started clapping, it only takes a couple of seconds for the rest of the crowd to follow. Most people aren’t making a conscious decision about whether they should applaud.

‘As individuals, we don’t want to be the only ones clapping, nor do we want to clap alone. It is a very instinctive form of peer pressure, it is incredibly powerful.’

But once the first one or two people stop clapping, the rest of the audience shortly follows. However, until this occurs, the group will keep on applauding.

‘You can get very different lengths of applause from identical talks, with rounds of applause that were two to three times longer,’ said Dr Mann.

‘We found boredom or tiredness is the main trigger for an individual to stop clapping, and once this happens, the rest of the crowd soon follow.’

He said the findings suggest the length of applause is not a safe way to gauge the quality of a performance.

‘You should be wary of encores - often 
people just keep on clapping as long as everyone else is,’ said Dr Mann.
 ‘On the plus side, performers can take comfort from this if they get a 
short round of applause.’

The research, which is published in the 
Journal of the Royal Society Interface, involved 107 students. They were
 split into six different groups and asked to listen to two 
presentations each.

Although the length of applause varied from group to group, the average time it took for the whole group to start clapping after the first individual had begun was under three seconds.

It also took the crowd less than three seconds to cease clapping after the first person stopped.

Dr Mann said that once 5 to 15 per cent of the group ended their applause, the rest were likely to follow.

The study concluded: ‘Variation in the length of applause can arise even for talks which are equally appreciated by the audience.

‘Randomness in the audience interactions can sometimes result in unusually strong or weak levels of appreciation, independent of the quality of the presentation.

‘Groups must coordinate the cessation of clapping and on different occasions this can take longer or shorter periods of time to achieve.

'The social problem an audience must solve after an academic presentation is not how and when to start a round of applause, but it is rather how to coordinate its end.’
