A kind-hearted woman who was handing out candy to little children on Halloween was devastated when she realized that she'd lost her wedding ring that night.

Brooklin Yazzie, from Mesa, Arizona is desperate to find her wedding ring after she accidentally gave it away with the Halloween candy on Friday night. 

She told ABC 15: ‘When I first realized what had happened, I just lost my speech, I froze,’

But the mom-of-two has revealed that the ring didn’t slip off her finger because she had placed it in a candy jar while helping her daughters carve pumpkins.

And when the night became hectic she absentmindedly dumped the contents of the jar into the candy bag.

‘I actually had plastic rings in there too, so it wouldn’t have felt much different,’ she said.

Yazzie said the ring is not necessarily expensive but has sentimental value.

She was only 20 years old when she married her husband 10 years ago, and says she couldn’t afford a fancy ring at the time.

Wanted: Yazzie has created posters to try and alert people to the lost wedding ring

‘If you were to try and pawn it or sell it you could probably get $50 for it. It's not an expensive ring,’ she said.

‘It’s my wedding ring, you know? I mean you could replace it but it’s not the same.’

Yazzie has created posters to try and alert people to the lost wedding ring. She has plastered them all around the area where she lives in the hope that someone has it.

She is hoping that someone has the ring and doesn’t know who it belongs to or how to return it.

She is asking anyone who finds it to return it to her at her address in the area of Broadway and Dobson roads in Mesa.
