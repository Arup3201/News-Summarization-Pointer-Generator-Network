A leading evolutionary researcher has claimed that sleeping around may have been the secret to the success of modern humans.

Experts have long debated exactly how Homo sapiens became the 'last human species standing' among several human ancestors.

Now it is claimed that interbreeding gave humans the advantage.

Humans (Homo sapiens) are primates of the family Hominidae, and the only species of the genus Hom that still exist.

Humans are characterised by having a large brain relative to body size, with a particularly well developed neocortex, prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes, making them capable of abstract reasoning, language, introspection, problem solving and culture through social learning.

Experts believe Homo sapiens originated in Africa, and fossils show it resembled modern humans about 200,000 years ago, and began to behave like them around 50,000 years ago.

'As recently as 40,000 years ago, Homo sapiens lived alongside several kindred forms, including the Neanderthals and tiny Homo floresiensism,' said Professor Robert Hammer of the Univeristy of Arizona, writing in Scientific American.

'For decades scientists have debated exactly how Homo sapiens originated and came to be the last human species standing,' he said.

One of the key theories emerged from genetic studies in the 1980s, when it was claimed anatomically modern humans arose in Africa and spread out across the rest of the Old World, completely replacing the existing archaic groups.

'Exactly how this novel form became the last human species on the earth is mysterious,' said Professor Hammer.

A 2011 study came to the same conclusion, and researchers claim that the first modern humans protected themselves against unfamiliar illnesses by interbreeding with Neanderthals.

Although it was known that homo sapiens had bred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa, a study has concluded that in doing so they picked up genes which protected them and eventually helped them to populate the planet.

'Given the complexity of the African fossil record, which indicates 
that a variety of transitional human groups, with a mosaic of archaic 
and modern features, lived over an extensive geographic area from 
Morocco to South Africa between roughly 200,000 and 35,000 years ago, I 
favor a model that involves interspecies mating during the 
archaic-to-modern transition,' Professor Hammer wrote.

'Sometimes called African Multiregional Evolution, this scenario 
allows for the possibility that some of the traits that make us 
anatomically modern were inherited from transitional forms before they 
went extinct.

'To my mind, African Multiregional Evolution, in combination with 
Bräuer's Hybridization model, best explains genetic and fossil data to 
date.'

However, Professor Hammer admits more research is needed to prove the theory.

The researcher hit the headlines earlier this year when  a DNA test on an American hoping to trace his family tree came up with a stunning result - the roots of the human tree date back much further than previously thought.

Researchers were shocked when they analysed the DNA of Albert Perry, a recently deceased African-American from South Carolina.

'This lineage diverged from previously known Y chromosomes about 338,000 years ago, a time when anatomically modern humans had not yet evolved,' said Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona.'This pushes back the time the last common Y chromosome ancestor lived by almost 70 percent.'

This time predates the age of the oldest known anatomically modern human fossils.

The fossil record dates back about 200,000 years, said Hammer.

Either interbreeding with Neanderthals or other populations led to the unusual genetic makeup, he said, or humans evolved far earlier than the extant fossil record suggests.

The new divergent lineage - which was found when Mr Perry contacted Family Tree DNA, a company specializing in DNA analysis to trace family roots - branched from the Y chromosome tree before the first appearance of anatomically modern humans in the fossil record.

Unlike the other human chromosomes, the majority of the Y chromosome does not exchange genetic material with other chromosomes, which makes it simpler to trace ancestral relationships among contemporary lineages.

If two Y chromosomes carry the same mutation, it is because they share a common paternal ancestor at some point in the past.

The more mutations that differ between two Y chromosomes the farther back in time the common ancestor lived.

The results are published in the American Journal of Human Genetics.

Originally, Mr Perry's DNA sample was submitted to the National Geographic Genographic Project.
