With just a week to go before The Great Gatsby hits the big screen, Prada have released a set of original sketches showing how Carey Mulligan and Isla Fisher's glamorous 1920s gowns took shape.

The sketches include a spectacular mint green frock laden with jewels, a neat navy and purple sequined number and a wonderful fur-collared cocktail dress embellished with supersized golden sequins.

In total, Prada creative director, Miuccia Prada, produced 40 bespoke dresses for the film, many of which were inspired by selected Prada and Miu Miu runway looks from the last 20 years.

Spectacular: A sparkling striped, sequinned pinafore frock and a shimmering dove grey flapper dress

The main wardrobe for the film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan and Isla Fisher, was created by legendary costume designer, Catherine Martin, who also worked with Prada on an earlier Baz Lurhman film, Romeo + Juliet.

'Baz and Miuccia have always connected on
their shared fascination with finding modern ways of releasing classic 
and historical references from the shackles of the past,' explains 
Martin.

'This connection is central to our relationship with Miuccia 
Prada on The Great Gatsby, and has connected our vision with hers.

'In 
the same way Nick Carraway reflects on a world that he is within and 
without, we have tried to create an environment that the audience will 
be subconsciously familiar with, yet separated from.'

Costumes takes a leading role, with a shimmering succession of silk gowns embroidered with crystal and sequins; velvets, furs and dancing fringing; flickering shades of emerald, jade, topaz and gold.

Particularly fashionable are the pivotal ball segments, set in Gatsbyâ€™s lavish fairytale mansion, during which the Prada and Miu Miu designs look set to steal the scene - in particular Mulligan's golden Prada party gown laden with crystals.

'Our collaboration with Prada recalls the European flair that was emerging amongst the aristocratic East Coast crowds in the 1920s,' adds Martin.

'The fashions of the time saw the development of a dichotomy between those who aspired to the privileged, Ivy League look of wealthy Long Island and those who were aspiring to European glamour, sophistication and decadence.

'Our collaborations with Prada reflect the collision of these two aesthetics.'

Some of the dresses in the collection have already gone on display at the Prada New York Epicenter in an exhibition which will run until 12th May.

The launch party saw Great Gatsby stars Carey Mulligan and Isla Fisher join Miuccia Prada and Catherine Martin at the Prada New York Epicenter for some 1920s-style cocktails ahead of the film's New York premiere the following day.

The fashionable film is to make its debut in UK cinemas next week.
