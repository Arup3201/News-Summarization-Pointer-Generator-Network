A mother who killed herself in Asda was bereft after the death of her daughter from a heart defect and told family 'my life is not worth living' before she died, it emerged today.

Sobia Yousef, 36, stabbed herself in the neck in the supermarket's kitchenware aisle in Shipley, West Yorkshire, on Tuesday morning in front of shoppers and staff.

The death of her child Mehwash, nine, who had struggled with a hole in the heart from birth, had 'triggered a collapse in her mother's mental state'.

Tragedy: Sobia Yousef, 36, left, stabbed herself in the neck in Asda this week after failing to cope with the death of daughter Mehwash, nine, right, who died last October from a rare heart condition

Mehwesh, who had a sister, Aqsa, 14, and brother Shaweeb, 12, had a number of heart operations in her short life but experts said she would never make it to ten.

Ms Yousef's brother Intiaz Ali said: 'When doctors told my sister there was nothing they could do to save her daughter she changed. Sobia would not eat or drink for days and would not leave her bedside for two months'.

Mr Ali also accused social services of 'abandoning' his sister and ignoring the family's pleas to have her sectioned.

'She had tried to harm herself and said that life was not worth living after Mehwash died', he said.

'We don't want any other family to go through what we have. Everybody has let us down'.

Tragic: Sobia Yousef, 36, died in front of horrified staff and shoppers in the kitchenware aisle of Asda in Shipley, West Yorkshire, on Tuesday morning

Shock: The victim was found lying in an aisle after injuring herself in the neck. She could not be saved

Four days of official mourning have started at Ms Yousef's mosque in Frizinghall, Bradford.

Bradford Councillor Imdad Hussain said she had undergone treatment at Lynfield Mount psychiatric hospital after her child passed away last year.

'It is a great tragedy which has left the whole local community and far beyond  in shock,' he said.

'It is such a terribly sad way for anyone to end their life.

'Sadly it seems that she lost her nine-year-old daughter some five months ago and it was that which triggered the collapse of her mental state.

'Her daughter had been born with an illness and the doctors only gave the baby a year to live.

'However she managed to stay alive until she was nine and there was a very special and close bond between the mother and daughter.'

Investigation: Police shut off the supermarket after the incident, said to be driven by the woman's 'collapse in mental state'

He said the care and treatment she received from mental health professionals needed to be examined.

He said: 'Questions have to be asked of the authorities and organisations involved over what support was being given.'

One eye-witness said: 'One of the shop's first aiders was trying to give CPR.

'One of the young men who works there actually saw the woman stabbing herself in the throat. He's in terrible shock'.

The store was cordoned off for the majority of Tuesday as police forensic teams worked inside.

West Yorkshire Police were alerted at around 8.37am to the store, along with paramedics.

A spokesman for the police force said the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.
