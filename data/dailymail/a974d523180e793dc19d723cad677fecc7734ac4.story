Victim: Timothy 'Asti' Davison was shot dead in a highway altercation that investigators now believe was a random act of road rage

Police have concluded that a 28-year-old Maine man was killed in a seemingly random act of road rage on Sunday.

Timothy 'Asti' Davison was driving up the East Coast from Florida to Maine when he called 911 in Northern Maryland as he was being shot at by a trailing vehicle.

Davison called from Interstate 81 near Maryland early Saturday to say someone in a pickup truck was firing on him.

The call was dropped and he called again, this time having crossed over the border into Pennsylvania.

According to police, Davison was forced into a median, disabling his vehicle, before the assailant approached and fired several rounds at him.

'I think we can call it a road rage incident,' Pennsylvania state trooper Rob Hicks told The Portland Press Herald.

'At this point we haven’t found anything that would connect the two men.'

Police
 are not releasing the recordings of the calls, but Mr Hicks said that 
Davison indicated that a driving issue- like one person cutting another 
off or braking suddenly- may have sparked the problem.

The only clues that the investigators- who have been joined by FBI teams- are basing their investigation off of are the grainy surveillance footage and bullet remnants.

Road rage: Timothy Davison called from Interstate 81 near Maryland early Saturday to say someone in a pickup truck was firing on him just moments before he was forced off the road (pictured) and shot dead

State police are searching for a Ford 
Ranger-style pickup. They say the vehicle may be blue and may have 
damage to the driver's side.

They say Davison, who was from Poland, Maine, died at a York hospital following the 2.10am attack.

Police say the attack occurred on northbound I-81 in Antrim Township, about 10 miles north of Hagerstown, Maryland.

According to police reports, Davison 
called 911 in Maryland shortly before 2am to report that he was being 
pursued by another motorist, but his call was dropped when he crossed 
into Pennsylvania. 

Davison,
 by then under fire, reached emergency dispatchers in Franklin County on
 the phone, but moments later was forced off the road and shot.

The circumstances of the fatal altercation are strikingly similar to those of a shooting that took place just three days earlier in Monaghan Township, Pennsylvania that is just 30 miles away from the scene of Davison's death.

'I just hope this doesn’t happen to 
anyone else. This wasn’t just road rage. This person is obviously 
crazy,' the victim's mother Theresa Alloca told The Kennebec Journal.

According to Bangor Daily News,
 Davison had worked for five years as a pipefitter and foreman at a 
Maine-based company co-owned by his father, also name Timothy Davison.

The elder Mr Davison told Portland Press Herald that
 his son was returning home Saturday after traveling to Florida to visit
 relatives for the holidays. He apparently chose Interstate 81 to avoid 
traffic. 

'He was a great kid,' Mr Davison said of his slain son.

The 28-year-old attended a technical school in Arizona to learn how to fix motorcycles before taking a job with his father's company in Raymond, Maine.

Police investigating the incident are not sure what prompted the attack, or if Davison had a prior history with his assailant.
