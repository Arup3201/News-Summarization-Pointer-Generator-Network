This is the terrifying moment a teenage gunman aimed his weapon at armed police officers, sparking a major firearms incident on a Scottish island.

Samuel Barlow was moments away from being shot by specially-trained firearms officers as he roamed around Shetland Mainland, brandishing his rifle in front of frightened residents.

Armed police almost opened fire at the 16-year-old as he repeatedly pointed his rifle at officers during the stand-off in September.

After strolling around Shetland Mainland with his rifle, Samuel Barlow (pictured) repeatedly pointed his weapon at armed police 

The 16-year-old was moments away from being shot by specially-trained firearms officers during the stand-off in September 

But a court heard how it was only the professionalism and courage of officers - who initially had no idea what type of gun Barlow was wielding - which prevented the stand-off ending in Barlow's death. 

Procurator fiscal Duncan Mackenzie told the Lerwick Sheriff Court: ‘I am not sure if the accused appreciates how close he became to being shot by police.’

The court heard how the incident - which lasted for several hours - had a ‘major impact on the community’.

At the height of the incident, every available officer in Shetland was called out and specially-trained officers from Inverness were flown in to provide back-up.

Residents were also urged to stay indoors as police dealt with the 'extremely serious' situation.

The shocking scenes emerged after Barlow, who was dressed in camouflage trousers and a beige top, was first seen walking with a rifle near Scord quarry, at the outskirts of Scalloway, shortly after midday.

Two police officers, alerted by concerned islanders, were unable to approach Barlow and had to take refuge behind a fire station building as he took aim at them.

After taking to the hills, Barlow appeared in the Westerloch area of Lerwick, the main town, later the same afternoon.

He walked through several people’s gardens, threatened locals and aimed his rifle at police officers who were trying to negotiate a peaceful solution to the stand-off.

Mr Mackenzie added: ‘999 calls were now coming in thick and fast, and a major police incident was declared. It is difficult to convey the concern that there was.’

At that stage, police did not know who they were dealing with and with what type of weapon Barlow was carrying, the court heard.

Mr Mackenzie said there had been a number of occasions where officers had to decide whether to fire, he added.

Unhappy with the police negotiators, Barlow then moved out of view again. Officers decided to ‘move beyond containment’ and make ‘an aggressive approach towards him’.

Mr Mackenzie said: ‘This was a very dangerous situation police officers were in. At the very end, only as the accused was restrained, it was confirmed he had only an air rifle.

‘The accused owes the officers a debt of gratitude for their professionalism and indeed their courage. It was very close to a fatal outcome.’

At the hearing Barlow – who was described as an inmate of Polmont Young Offenders’ Institution, near Falkirk, Stirlingshire – admitted four charges of assault and one of abusive and threatening behaviour. 

Barlow's sentencing was deferred until January 7 for psychological and psychiatric reports.

Defence solicitor Tommy Allan said he would wait for the psychological report before addressing the court in mitigation. His application for his client to be released on bail was refused.

Sheriff Philip Mann said he had no other option than to keep Barlow in custody and warned him that a custodial sentence was very much a possibility.
