An Australian photographer has captured incredible close-up images of penguins leaping out of the freezing ocean.

The colony of penguins was jumping for joy on leaving the water to warm up on the ice after hunting for food.

Photographer and marine scientist Frederique Olivier got his camera within a few feet of the flightless birds as they appeared to soar out of the ocean.

Mr Olivier, a marine scientist, got his camera within a few feet of the flightless birds as they appeared to soar out of the ocean

'The penguins didn't pay much attention to me' and were sometimes friendly towards humans, says Frederique Olivier

Frederique photographed the graceful animals at the Casey research station in Antarctica’s Windmill Islands.

After jumping out of the water, the wide-eyed Adelie penguins throw their wings behind them and kick their feet to get a good landing.

They pull excited faces and flick their tails behind them as they make it onto dry but cold land.

Frederique Olivier said he felt humble while photographing the penguins because they 'are incredibly adapted' to the frigid environment

Frederique, 38, said: ‘You have to be incredibly patient to get the images of the right behaviour in the right light.

‘And you also have to cope with the temperature and winds as I gets down to minus-30 in the Antarctic winter.' 

He was able to get close to the penguins as they weren't bothered by his presence. 

The adult penguins 'are all about breeding and raising chicks in the colony', so Mr Olivier had to be very careful not to disturb them

Frederique Olivier, 38, said he had to be 'incredibly patient' to capture the stunning images of the 'flying' penguins in the right light

He added: ‘The penguins didn't pay much attention to me - their mood varies and sometimes they are friendly but it is all about breeding and raising chicks in the colony.

‘They make you feel humble because they are incredibly adapted to the environment that they are in, whereas it is a challenge for us to survive.

‘It's sometimes hard for them too so we have to be very careful not to disturb them.’
