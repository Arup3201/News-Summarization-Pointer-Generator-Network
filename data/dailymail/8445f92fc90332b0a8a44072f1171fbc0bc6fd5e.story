New York Senator Chuck Schumer is the first prominent Democrat to publicly endorse Hillary Clinton as the next president of the United States.

The party seems to be staging a unified stance behind Clinton as it was revealed earlier this week that all 16 female Democratic senators sent Clinton a letter earlier this year, urging her to run in 2016.

'2016 is Hillary's time,' Senator Schumer said at a Democratic party dinner in Iowa yesterday. 'And our nation will be all the better for it.'

An aide for Mr Schumer said the endorsement was not made at Clinton's request.

'Run, Hillary, run,' Mr Schumer said. 'If you run, you'll win and we'll all win. With a strong platform and with Hillary leading the charge, we will vanquish the Ted Cruz Tea Party Republicans in 2016.'

Others are showing their early support for a Clinton ticket in a more private way.

The potential candidate: Clinton spend Friday speaking at a women's conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Senator Kay Hagan, the Democratic senator from North Carolina, slipped up at an event in New York City last week when she revealed the existence of a secret letter she and all the other female Democratic senators signed earlier this year in support of Clinton.

While the content of the letter has not been released, it appears to have been organized by Senator Barbara Boxer.

Senator Boxer would not comment directly on the letter but told ABC News: 'I have repeatedly said - publicly, privately and in writing - that Hillary Clinton should run for president in 2016. I can only speak for myself. I'll leave it to my colleagues to describe their views.'

Surprisingly, three of the women who signed the letter are rumored candidates themselves - Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

Friends or foes? One of the signers of the female senator's letter was Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (right) who many are considering as a more liberal option for the 2016 ticket

After stepping down from her position as Secretary of State last January, Clinton at the time said she was 'not inclined' towards another presidential run.

But lately she seems to be dropping more hints in favor of running and seems to be the most likely contender for the party ticket.

While receiving an honorary degree at St Andrew's University in Scotland on September 13, Clinton said she hadn't made up her mind yet but was 'minded' to run.
