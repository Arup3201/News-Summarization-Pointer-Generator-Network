Fall: Trevyn Hope Joslin died after injuring herself in a PE lesson

A 12-year-old schoolgirl died after she caught her foot on a pommel horse and fell during a PE lesson.

Paramedics were called to the gym at Taverham High School, Norfolk, on March 12 after Trevyn Hope Joslin, from Thorpe Marriott in Norfolk, injured herself in the fall.

Teachers and pupils tried to help her but she died in hospital a week later, an inquest heard.

Norfolk Coroner’s Court heard she had a pre-existing neck condition which could have limited her ability to take part in some sports, including gymnastics.

The school knew about the condition but because of an administrative oversight had failed to flag it up to all staff, the inquest heard.

However, pathologist Nat Cary found the injuries suffered in the fall could have killed somebody with an 'anatomically normal' neck.

Norfolk Police and the Health and Safety Executive found no evidence of any failings.

A jury concluded she died as a result of accidental death.

Assistant coroner David Osborne said: 'A young life when lost is extremely difficult and I would offer my condolences to the family.'

Assistant head and PE teacher Shirley Naisby described how she had organised the 'basic flight' gym class.

She said Trevyn was 'confident, enthusiastic and one of the better gymnasts in the class'.

'In the last 10 or 15 minutes, the students could select which piece of equipment they wanted to go on and Trevyn selected the horse.

Tragic: Trevyn Joslin, pictured with friends in a playground, was described as 'one of the better gymnasts' in her class

Accident: Trevyn caught her foot in a pommel horse, similar to that pictured being used by Olympic gymnast Louis Smith at last summer's Olympic Games

'She had a few successful jumps then went to make another. She ran up perfectly well but as she jumped her right foot caught the front-end of the horse and she tumbled forward and landed face down on the matt almost in the recovery position.

'Some of her friends were close to her and gathered around where she had fallen. One of them said "Miss she’s winded".

'She was trying to mouth words but it was very difficult to hear what she was saying.'

An ambulance was called and staff tried to administer first aid. Lynne Hammond, the school’s pastoral care supervisor, administered CPR.

Ms Hammond said: 'I was struggling to accept the reality of the situation - you just want to believe a child is still breathing.'

Pupil: Trevyn attended Taverham High School in Norfolk

The post-mortem examination found she died from a hyper-extension injury to the neck.

Headteacher Peter Whear said a memorial garden had been created and a cherry tree planted in the school’s grounds in tribute to Trevyn.

He added: 'She always had a smile on her face and will be remembered with great fondness by staff and students who continue to talk about her with warmth and affection.

'We also wish to pay tribute to Trevyn’s parents for the dignity and poise they have shown all along and as they now seek to rebuild their lives.

Emergency treatment: Trevyn was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, but died of her injuries

'This was a tragic accident which nobody could have foreseen happening.

'We take the safety of our students extremely seriously and the school has since carried out a full and comprehensive review of all its health and safety procedures. We will never forget Trevyn.'

Trevyn’s parents Derrick and Hannah did not comment as they left the inquest.
