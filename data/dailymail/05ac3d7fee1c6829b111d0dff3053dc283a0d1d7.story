England were terrific against Wales but if I was at their team meeting at Pennyhill Park on Monday morning the first thing I would do is stick the RBS 6 Nations league table on the whiteboard.

It will show England third behind Ireland and France. England have turned an important corner but they have achieved nothing yet. They are always the team everyone wants to beat and that will go up another level after the win in Cardiff.

England have won only one Six Nations Championship since 2003 so now is the time to step up another level. It’s time to be hyper-critical and reset their goals. In any sport what seems like the best win of your life at the time is often only a stepping stone to something much better and more significant.

I would also remind those who did so well against Wales that England now have a growing number of very talented players who have either been dropped or injured and will be busting a gut to get back into the team: the likes of Alex Corbisiero, Danny Care, Brad Barritt, Tom Wood, Owen Farrell, Geoff Parling, Kyle Eastmond and Christian Wade to name but a few.

And that’s before you consider long-term injury victims Manu Tuilagi, Ben Morgan and Joe Launchbury. These guys will not be celebrating Friday’s win and will be redoubling their efforts to get back into the team.

Against Italy you go with the squad that did so well against Wales although I would bring Courtney Lawes back if fit. That’s no slight on George Kruis, who did well, but Lawes is a big player for England and needs to be involved whenever possible.

The great thing about Friday night in Cardiff was the hard-edged mental attitude and ruthless approach England displayed starting from the stand-off in the tunnel and ending with George Ford banging over a long kick to close out the game. Brilliant, it was a quantum leap for the future and with that approach England can achieve great things.

Everybody expects them to beat Italy on Saturday and this could easily be a week in which the intensity in training and playing drops off 10 per cent.

Wrong! This must be the week when everybody ups their intensity 10 per cent. I’d even take it further than that. I would challenge England to hit some easily measurable world-class standards against Italy.

SET-PIECES MUST BE SLICKER

One hundred per cent scrum-possession from your put-in is a must. England achieved this against Wales and must replicate that against a strong Italy pack.

In the lineout, 95 per cent possession on your own throw is the standard required. In Cardiff England were 81.8 per cent, which is good but not good enough. Italy have a strong lineout so this will be a genuine challenge.

England's lineout possession percentage must improve, while there were too many soft penalties given away

Luther Burrell did well in most departments, but England's kicking strategy needs to change 

TOO MANY SOFT PENALTIES 

England conceded nine in Cardiff which is on the limit of what is acceptable. Three in the first half were needless and normally Leigh Halfpenny would have landed all three, not just two. Against Italy the world-class standard would be six and I would bring a professional referee into every session to make sure every player understands the law.

CUT DOWN ON CHARGEDOWNS

Three chargedowns is at least two too many. England have no real kicking option at 12 — though Luther Burrell did very well in other departments — so Mike Brown and Anthony Watson, who are great kickers, should be made part of the kicking strategy to give Ben Youngs and Ford more options.

DON'T FORGET DROP GOALS

Whatever happened to the drop goal? In 35 Tests under Stuart Lancaster England have kicked just three, an amazing figure.

I can guarantee you somewhere along the line this year England will have to kick a couple of drop goals at crucial times.

So let’s start working on that now. I would want to see three drop goals against Italy, doubling the total of the last three years. And let’s try to kick one in the first five minutes of each half.

DON'T GET DISTRACTED

I would ban all talk of any other nation and indeed the Six Nations Championship generally, let alone the World Cup.

The focus should be totally on producing a world-class performance against Italy. For this week nothing else in the rugby world matters.

For those who stray consequences should be clearly spelt out to them. This team must continue to toughen up.

IT'S AN 80 MINUTE GAME

I worked out many years ago that 90 per cent of all Tests between the top six nations in the world have a points difference of less than seven going into the last 20 minutes.

So you want your top players on the park during the last quarter. How often do you ever see Richie McCaw substituted for any reason other than injury?

I want England to start the game on Saturday with the mindset that everybody, barring injuries, will play the entire 80 minutes. They have the fitness and conditioning to do that.

If England are leading by a big margin after 70 minutes I would accept you empty the entire bench to guard against injury. But not before then.

England have turned a corner but they haven't achieved anything yet

@highlight

They are third in the Six Nations table and must now reset their goals

@highlight

England's set pieces must be slicker, and they can't afford to give away sloppy penalties as they did against Wales

@highlight

Stuart Lancaster's side have only kicked three drop goals in 35 Tests - they should try and kick that many in one game against Italy
