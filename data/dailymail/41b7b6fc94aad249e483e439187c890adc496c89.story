Chris Hughton has emerged as favourite to take over at Fulham.

The former Norwich and Newcastle manager features on a three-man shortlist drawn up by Fulham’s committee as the Championship club seek to replace Felix Magath, who was sacked last month.

Fulham owner, Shahid Khan, appointed a five-man panel, consisting of Danny Murphy, Brian McBride, Niall Quinn, Huw Jennings and David Daly, to advise on potential candidates for the role.
