A woman was forced to leave a plane because passengers were being disrupted by her travelling companion - a pot-bellied pig.

The unidentified individual boarded the US Airways flight to Connecticut with the animal on Wednesday.

She took the creature, said to weigh up to 70 pounds, to her seat and then attached it to her armrest - but when it became disruptive flight attendants asked her to leave the plane.

The unidentified passenger was asked to leave the US Airways flight after the pot-bellied pig she carried on became disruptive 

Jonathan Skolnik, a professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst told ABC News today he thought the woman was carrying a duffel bag and headed straight for the empty seat next to him.

However he then realized he could smell the animal and noticed it was on a leash. 

'The pig was walking back and forth,' he told the station. 'I was terrified, because I was thinking I'm gonna be on the plane with the pig

In 2012 it was revealed that the Department of Transportation had certain guidelines allowing animals, including pot-bellied pigs, could be taken on flights.

Along with monkeys and miniature horses, they could be designated as 'Emotional Support'. 

Transportation officers would have to determine whether the animal is permitted on the plane by running through a list of guidelines. 

Pigs are favored service animals for people allergic to dogs. Guidelines suggest they are intelligent companions and attuned to dangerous situations. 

American Airlines, the parent company of US Airways, said the woman had the pig as an emotional support animal and was asked to leave the plane after it became disruptive.
