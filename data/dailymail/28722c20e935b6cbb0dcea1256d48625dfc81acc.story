Jailed: Keith Sivills siphoned off £168,000 to fund his lavish lifestyle

A businessman who stole tens of thousands of pounds to fund his extravagant lifestyle has been jailed for 20 months.

Keith Sivills, 55, admitted to creating false documents for CB Construction (Cleveland) Ltd in a £168,000 tax dodge which took place over three years up to 2010.

Teesside Crown Court heard how he siphoned off £100,000 plus from the business for his own purposes.

The 55-year-old, who is also a racehorse owner and football club president, was branded ‘greedy’ by a judge as he was jailed.

Judge Simon Bourne-Arton, QC, told 
Sivills: ‘You acted out of greed and have lost your good name and 
standing in the community, and let everyone down.’

Sivill’s barrister, Richard Fisher, told the court that the 55-year-old was a successful director and was not trying to keep an ailing company afloat.

He described the crimes, which saw him providing false trading accounts and VAT returns, as ‘a serious error of judgement on his part'.

He also admitted they were carried out through greed because Sivills ‘had a certain lifestyle’.

Mr Fisher described the tax evasion as ‘madness’
and said the businessman, from Easington, near Saltburn, east 
Cleveland, had behaved in a selfless way in other aspects of his life.

He said Sivills had worked with local charities and sports clubs, and had helped people - including those who had been in prison to find employment.

Sivills is the president of Evo-Stik 
Northern Premier League football club, Whitby Town, and has owned a 
number of national hunt racehorses in the past.

He admitted making false statements on accounts between 2007 and 2010, and on VAT returns between 2008 and 2009, when he appeared in court in November last year.

The court heard that he created false invoices to pocket money for himself, and wrote out company cheques for cash, as well as submitting false tax returns.

The swindle resulted in a loss to HM Revenue and Customs of £168,000 but at an earlier hearing, it was revealed that Sivills has repaid more than that amount which he cheated from public funds.
