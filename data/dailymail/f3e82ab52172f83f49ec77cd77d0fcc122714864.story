Six children aged from seven to 12 and three adults were rescued by lifeguards after getting trapped in a gully on a popular family beach.

The group became stranded in Treyarnon, North Cornwall, when the gully they were in quickly filled with water as the tide came in - with a solid 5ft swell washing through.

They huddled together on a rocky platform near a deep cave on the beach but were at risk of being swept off - and as it was too dangerous for them to try to leave the gully, lifeguards were called.Scroll down for video of the rescue

Got you: RNLI crew rescue one of the nine people trapped on a gully on a beach in North Cornwall yesterday

The conditions meant neither lifeboats nor paddleboards could be used, so lifeguards had to swim each member of the group to safety.

Senior RNLI lifeguard Martin White spotted the stricken group with RNLI lifeguard Andy Houlder, who called for back-up from RNLI lifeguards Zahli Lowe and Dan Lee.

Mr White said: ‘Because of the shape of the gully and the size of the swell, it was impossible to get the inshore rescue boat (IRB) or even the rescue board in close enough to pick up the casualties so the only way was to swim in.

‘Myself and Andy swam in with rescue tubes, and communicated with Zahli and Dan who were standing off in the IRB. They could see when a set of waves was coming through so we could time our exit in the lull between sets. 

On board: The three adults and six youngsters aged between seven and 12 were at Treyarnon in Cornwall

Help: The conditions meant neither lifeboats nor paddleboards could be used, so lifeguards had to swim each member of the group to safety

‘We swam two children out first, with a
dad who was helping another child.

'It was a very difficult and long process, made even worse by the time pressures of the incoming tide and a building swell'

‘We dropped them off at the beach 15 metres (50ft) away and returned for the second group.

'We
repeated the process with the other three children and one of the 
adults who was a stronger swimmer helping one of the children.

‘Andy returned to help the final adult, dropping them off at the IRB. It was a very difficult and long process, made even worse by the time pressures of the incoming tide and a building swell.

Packed: The RNLI said yesterday was an 'extremely busy day' for lifeguards on the beach (file picture), with 200 people in the water at Treyarnon

'Thankfully we all know this beach and 
stretch of coastline very well and were able to read the waves and get 
them all out safely.’

Mr White said lifeguards had just rescued two people in a kayak who had been washed into a nearby cove when they were alerted to the stranded group huddled together on the rocky platform above the gully, which was quickly filling with the incoming tide.

He said the gully has a deep cave at the back, so the only way out was the way the group had gone in. The RNLI said yesterday was an ‘extremely busy day’ for lifeguards on the beach, with 200 people in the water at Treyarnon.
