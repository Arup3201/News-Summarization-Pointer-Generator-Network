Ryan Guntrip, 21, told his girlfriend he wished he had never got her pregnant before punching her in the stomach

A man who told his girlfriend he wished he had never got her pregnant before punching her in the stomach has been jailed after she lost the baby.

A medical examination carried out the day after Carina MacKay miscarried revealed that the baby had died, but prosecutors could not prove Ryan Guntrip, 21, was responsible.

Colchester Magistrates’ Court heard yesterday that he and Ms MacKay had been arguing at her home in Clacton, Essex, where he was staying on June 18 this year.

He flew into a rage, told her he wished he’d never got her pregnant and punched her in the stomach.

He also put his arms on her shoulders to move her out of the way, the court heard.

The next morning Ms MacKay noticed she was bleeding and went for tests, which revealed the baby was dead.

The court heard she was in the early stages of pregnancy and medics could not be certain what caused the baby’s death.

Guntrip, who has a history of violence, admitted assault by beating.

He was out on licence at the time of the incident for a previous domestic assault, the court heard.

District Judge John Woollard jailed Guntrip for 16 weeks.

He said: 'You have an appalling record of violence. I’m not sentencing you for the tragic consequences.

'The crown has decided it can’t prove what caused it, but you did punch a woman in the stomach when she was expecting a child.'

Speaking after the hearing, Ms MacKay, a restaurant supervisor said: 'I was so angry when I heard he had only been sentenced to 16 weeks. 

'In my eyes, he deserved a lot longer.'

She said the couple had been on the verge of breaking up when Guntrip attacked her.  She said: 'He was really drunk and was throwing things around the room in our flat. 

'I had told him that I did not want to be with him anymore and it was then that he punched me in the stomach.

'It was a single punch - his arm was against his waist and then he threw it forward and I felt a sharp, shooting pain and then it subsided.

'He was saying he regretted getting me pregnant - I did not know what was going through his mind but I was so scared.'

The following morning she said she noticed she was bleeding and a hospital scan revealed her baby had died.

It was eight weeks and five days old.

Ms MacKay added: 'It was horrible - I had lost a baby before so for this to have happened was just so upsetting. 

'Seeing
the picture of the baby made it hard to take but Ryan did not care. He 
just said 'there's no reason for us to have contact anymore now'.'

Medics told Miss MacKay that they could not prove the punch killed the child.

According to her, when the couple first met in December 2012, Guntrip was the perfect gentleman. 

But Guntrip was out on licence following a prison sentence for an attack on his ex-girlfriend, she said.

She
said: 'When we got together I did not know he had been in prison - it 
was only three months into the relationship that I found out.' 'I asked him what it was for and he admitted it was for beating up his ex girlfriend.

'But
I was not too worried at the time because at the beginning, he was the 
perfect gentleman. He looked after me and cared for me and was always 
there for me.

'If I needed him, he would be there and he was also very protective of me.'

She said things deteriorated when their relationship started to break down, and he began to drink heavily.

She added: 'I just hope that by speaking out, it will mean that other girls won't end up in the same situation that I was in. 

'I
have moved on with my life now, but I know there are other people who 
are in abusive relationships and they should get help as soon as they 
can, ' she said.

The court also made a restraining order, banning Guntrip from contacting Ms MacKay, going to the street where she lives or to her grandmother’s house.

Roger Brice, mitigating, said Guntrip wants closure and said there is no link between this incident and the tragic consequences.

He said Guntrip has been using his time in custody productively.
