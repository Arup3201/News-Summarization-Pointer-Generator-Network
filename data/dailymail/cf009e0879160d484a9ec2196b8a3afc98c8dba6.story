Social workers have offered the teenage victim of paedophile teacher Jeremy Forrest the chance to meet with him to explain the impact of his grooming

The schoolgirl who was groomed and abducted by paedophile teacher Jeremy Forrest has been offered the chance to meet him by social workers.

Forrest was jailed after he had sex with the girl, then 15, and fled to France with her - finally being arrested after a week on the run.

In the case that followed - during which the child at first pledged to stand by the maths teacher and professed her love for him - it emerged Forrest had begun grooming her when she was just 14. 

The girl's mother told BBC Radio 5 Live Daily that social workers had approached her daughter, who is almost 18, and offered her the chance to meet Forrest.

They said the meeting could take place as part of the restorative justice scheme, where victims are given the chance to meet criminals so they can explain the impact of their actions.

It is also thought to help to rehabilitate offenders by allowing them to see the personal impact their crime has had, and take responsibility. All meetings are supervised and in a controlled environment. 

Davina Williams, who has changed her name to protect her daughter's identity, said her daughter had not yet decided whether to take up the offer. 

But she added that the choice would be her teenage daughter's only.  

She said: 'I know she's in control of whatever happens next and rightly so. As a parent, you protect as much as you can as children and you teach the best you possibly can to give them the best start in life. 

'When they are adults, you have to allow them to lead their own life. You don't have any control. I will always be here. I will always be her mum whatever happens.

'When a child has been groomed, it can take months, it can take years for them to accept that this has happened to them. You can't force them, you can't make them, they have to do it their own time. While they go through that process they have to find a way to cope with it.'

Forrest previously worked at Bishop Bell School in East Sussex.

He began his relationship with the girl on a school trip to Los Angeles when she was 14 and was seen holding her hand on the plane – something she claims he was doing to comfort her as she was struggling with bulimia.

She opened up to him about the break-up of her parents' marriage before he kissed her in a classroom.

She said they would have sex in his Ford Fiesta or hotels, which they would check into as Mr and Mrs Forrest.

They first had sex when she was 15 and it later emerged that Forrest had been grooming the pupil since she was 13.  

Restorative justice is a government scheme aimed at giving victims a voice. 

It allows victims to meet perpetrators of crime to explain the personal impact of their actions upon them. 

Meetings are held in a controlled environment and offenders must have admitted the crime. 

All meetings are supervised.  

The scheme allows offenders to take responsibility for their actions and try to make amends with their victims.

For offenders, meeting their victims can be a challenging experience because they are forced to confront the personal impact of their crimes. 

Restorative justice is used in a bid to rehabilitate people who have committed a number of crimes include violent offences and sexual assaults. 

According to the restorative justice council it accounts for a 14 per cent reduction in reoffending.  

In 2012 police were alerted to their relationship and the pair fled to France, using false names. 

They had planned to set up a new life together and Forrest left behind his marriage and career. 

The pair were found when they were spotted in Bordeaux after eight days on the run.

Forrest, who was married at the time, was convicted for sex offences and abduction and was jailed for five-and-a-half-years. 

He was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life. 

After the case the teenager said: 'I love Jeremy so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once he's out, we can marry and have children.'

Forrest had previously insisted he was not a paedophile but had simply fallen in love with the teenager. 

Last year the girl, then 16, was said to have started a new relationship with a 20-year-old part time teacher and security guard. 

Forrest, 32, is due to be released in the summer.
