High school is a tough time for any teenager, but the students at Miami Sunset Senior High School seem to have it a little harder.

Photos from inside the school have surfaced on social media showing horrifying conditions, from a moldy carton of fruit punch, to brown tap water and cockroaches on the walls and the food.

'When I’m in school I expect to be taken care of,' former student Angie Garcia, who said she left because of the state of the school, told NBC MIami.

'I expect to be protected by the staff and by the faculty and they did none of that. 

'I’m not sure what their interests are, but it’s certainly not us.'

'It was just deplorable.'

Horrifying: Photos showing the terrible conditions inside Miami Sunset Senior High School have gone viral. A shot of a moldy carton of fruit punch (pictured) is the most disturbing

Thirsty?: Students claim the water from the drinking fountain comes out brown, yellow, grey or cloudy, but the school district says it has passed safety tests

Yummy: A cockroach is seen here on the side of a milk carton

Mold: Of particular concern is the state of the bathrooms, which appear moldy and damp

The disturbing photos quickly went viral and have outraged many, especially parents.

Darlene Pratt told WSVN she is worried about her child's health and safety.

 'I'm disgusted,' she told the network.

'Health hazards, safety hazards, it's a huge concern and seeing the pictures with the mold, and knowing that that is what my child is being served for lunch.

'It's very, very, very disturbing.'

The photos have forced the local school district to answer questions about cleanliness.

Barbara Mendizabal, Sunset's regional superintendent at Miami-Dade County Schools, said it was a back-to-school issue and that the facility is normally not in such a state.

'What we can say also is that prior to winter break, the building was not cleaned properly,' she said.

Okay: A worrying sign was posted above the drinking fountain, despite the water apparently passing safety tests

Ick: Another carton of fruit punch is seen covered in mold

Mendizabal said the moldy juice - which is the most horrifying of the photos to emerge - was thrown away and not consumed.

'A student, during lunch time brought it up to the assistant principal's attention, that the juice tasted funny,' she told WSVN.

'He brought it up with the cafeteria manager and the assistant manager, and they quickly picked up all the juices and discarded the juices.'

The school district has maintained the water has passed all the necessary safety tests. 

A lot to answer for: Barbara Mendizabal, Sunset's regional superintendent at Miami-Dade County Schools, said the district is looking into the problems and trying to organize repairs

The buildings at Miami Sunset Senior High School are nearly 40 years old.

The school is in the running for a grant that would award them $6 million, which would be spent on repairs. 

'Some of the upgrades will include the upgrading of the plumbing system, will include also renovation of the restrooms, painting throughout the building,' Mendizabal said.

She also admitted the situation 'is not acceptable'.
