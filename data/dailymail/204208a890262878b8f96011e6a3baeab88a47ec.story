Desperate women are putting their lives at risk by buying potentially deadly fertility drugs sold illegally through the online auction site eBay.

The prescription-only medications can cause blood clots, deep vein thrombosis and strokes.

Women may also develop ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome, that can cause fatal organ failure, and life-threatening cysts, as Lorraine Davy did in a case study.

Women unable to afford private treatment are buying the egg production-boosting drugs online after being refused NHS funding, doctors say.

An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has revealed that IVF medication is being sold for a third of the normal market price on eBay. The fertility drugs include brand names Suprecur, Cetrotide and Menopur. They are hormone treatments used to stimulate the ovary to produce more eggs to increase fertility and as part of IVF procedures.

Last night doctors called for women to be warned of the dangers of buying such drugs over the internet.

Leading fertility expert Professor Lord Winston cautioned: ‘You don’t know if they are what they say on the packet. The drugs may not be pure and there’s always a risk when drugs are taken without medical supervision.’

Dr Geetha Venkat, a consultant at the private Harley Street Fertility Clinic, added: ‘Women need to be warned against buying these medications online. These are hormone injections and unless they are medically supervised they can be dangerous to life.’

But Dr Venkat said despite the dangers women were tempted to buy IVF drugs online because they are rejected for NHS funding and cannot afford the high costs of paying privately.

But Dr Venkat said despite the dangers women were tempted to buy IVF drugs online because they are rejected for NHS funding and cannot afford the high costs of paying privately.

She said: ‘Fertility treatment is quite expensive and it’s not available in many areas, even though NICE guidelines say that couples should be eligible for three cycles of IVF. It’s like a postcode lottery.

‘So the women buying the drugs on eBay are probably trying to cut the cost of paying privately.’

The MoS found that 1mg of Suprecur, which normally costs £35 at a private clinic, can be bought for as little as £15 on eBay. Meanwhile, a packet containing ten vials of Menopur to inject, costing £300 when purchased privately, is on sale for £100. It is suspected the sellers could be either unscrupulous pharmacists, criminals selling counterfeit goods or couples who have gone through IVF and have left over medication.

The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) confirmed yesterday that it is illegal for IVF drugs to be sold anywhere other than at a registered pharmacy or under the supervision of a pharmacist.

An MHRA spokesman said: ‘This is unacceptable and we’ve asked eBay to remove these medicines from sale as a matter of priority.’

An eBay spokesman said: ‘Our policies prohibit the listing of prescription drugs. Ebay works closely with the MHRA and other regulators who have a direct line to eBay to enable us to remove any listings of concern as soon as they are reported.’

Lorraine Davy was desperate to become a mother after suffering three miscarriages in six years.

Ms Davy said doctors refused her NHS-funded IVF treatment because of her bipolar disorder.

Unable to afford to go private, she bought the drug Clomid – which boosts egg production – on the internet. Lorraine, 26, recalled: ‘I really wanted a child and I was at my wits’ end. The price was just under £30 – so it was quite cheap. The next thing was that I got a month’s worth of tablets through the post.’

Lorraine, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, said: ‘I started taking them and within a week I began getting pains in my stomach.

‘I got rushed into A&E and they did an ultrasound and the doctor said I had a massive cyst on my ovaries as big as a newborn baby’s head.’ The cyst almost cost Lorraine her life.

‘The doctor said it was touch and go because of the size of it. I told him I’d taken Clomid and he said that was the cause of the cyst.’
