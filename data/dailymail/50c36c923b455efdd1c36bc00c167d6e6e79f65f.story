The stars are naked, but it’s not as sexy as it sounds.

The Discovery Channel is getting ready to unveil two new survival reality shows featuring nude participants who will have to use their instincts and the elements around them, including mud, sticks and grass, to endure.

‘Naked Castaway’, which debuts April 14, features survivalist Ed Stafford who lands naked and alone on a deserted island southeast of Fiji with one only item: a camera.

Stafford, who brings no food, water, clothes, weapons or tools, will have to find and make his own using his bare hands in order to survive during his 60 days on the island.

‘Naked and Afraid,’ which debuts this summer, features two naked strangers who meet for the first time in Tanzania on the Serengeti plains surrounded by the wilderness and plenty of wild animals.

‘I’m an ultimate survivalist,’ one of the show’s female stars, Kellie Nightlinger, 38, told the Daily News.

Nightlinger said she had been starving after spending two weeks in the wild when she devised an innovative way to catch fish using her private parts as bait and then trapping her meal between her legs.

‘We needed something with protein and because the water was so muddy, traditional fishing methods wouldn’t work, so I had to improvise, adapt and overcome,’ said Nightlinger.

During the night time, the female survivalist and her partner on the show, E.J. Snyder, a retired Army veteran, used a fire that they lit by rubbing sticks together to keep hyenas away.

‘They were frightening, but at least they seemed to be afraid of fire,’ she told the Daily News.

Other episodes of ‘Naked and Afraid’, featuring different nude paired up strangers, have been filmed in Panama, Costa Rica, the Maldives and Borneo, according to Discovery.

‘I think the challenge brings out the very best and very worst,’ the show’s executive producer Steve Rankin told the Daily News yesterday from a hospital bed in Costa Rica where he was recovering after being bitten hours earlier by a venomous snake while working on the show.

‘The idea here is to push the ball down the field,’ Discovery channel executive, Craig Coffman told the Daily News. ‘Survival shows are so common now that it’s gotten more and more difficult to convince the audience that what they’re watching is something extreme.

‘Having no clothes just takes it to the next level. It’s the ultimate test and makes survival exponentially more difficult.’
