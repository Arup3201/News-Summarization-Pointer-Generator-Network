An artist has created stunning designs using spiderwebs he finds on his travels.

Emil Fiore, 60, turns the intricate webs into beautiful pieces of art by carefully mounting them on coloured glass which can be displayed on the wall.

Each of the New Jersey artist's works are unique and show the differences between spider species and their webs, which can vary between triangular, circular, and hexagonal shapes.

When he finds a delicate web he begins by spraying it with a coloured paint and then places a varnished piece of glass behind it.

Once it has stuck firmly in place he coats the back of the glass in a dark colour and waits for it to dry, before selling the works to customers all over the world.

The pieces measure between one inch and 30 inches in diameter and sell for up to Â£180.

Emil said: 'I discovered that a local park that I was fond of visiting as a child held a variety of spiders in abundance.

'Spider webs are beautiful and I thought if I could master the catching process, it would be worthwhile.

'I find a nice web, evict the spider, spray the web with paint, spray the glass with varnish, bring the glass to the web and allow the web to bond with the varnish.

'I then wait for it to dry and paint over the varnish with a color that contrasts with the spray paint used on the web.

'At first, I only managed one good catch in 10, now I get about nine out of 10, it is something that I am still learning.'

Talented Emil has become so used to 
working with spiders he can tell what specific breed has created a web 
simply by looking at it, and has worked with more than 30 types.

These range from the Hyptiotes 
Cavatus - which produces a triangular shaped web - to the Micrathena Gracilis, which sits in a tightly coiled web.

'Webs are quite recognisable to a trained eye and I have caught over two dozen different species,' he said.

'All spiders weave a web that is unique to the species, some of course are very similar and could be confused with another.

'What I like most is the amazing architecture, beautiful design, perfect irregularity, resilience and strength, and the spiders themselves are awesome looking animals.

'Some, like the triangular web of Hyptiotes Cavatus, are so distinct they would never be confused with another, but I recognise all my webs.'
