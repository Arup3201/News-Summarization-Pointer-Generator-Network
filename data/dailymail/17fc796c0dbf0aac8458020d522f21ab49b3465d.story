It is a common problem for airlines, ferries and cruise ships - how do you make passengers pay attention to the safety briefing?

Condor Ferries believes it has found the solution, producing a video complete with a rapping captain and dancing staff that certainly attracts attention.

Doing away with the monotone yet informative messages usually portrayed in safety briefings, the Portsmouth-based company said it wanted to inject some 'fun' into this year's offering. 

But not everybody is a fan, with some commentators saying they would prefer to jump overboard than listen to the song.

The captain introduces the rap for a very different safety demonstration

Condor Ferries have produced the safety rap as part of their 'Good Times' branding

Slightly out of sync and with some incredibly cringeworthy dance moves, the video seems to have done the trick and has already been viewed nearly 20,000 times since it was posted on YouTube several days ago.

The video begins with a captain sporting blue sunglasses and some questionable moves as he announces: 'To ensure you have good times on board, please listen up to the following safety message from Condor Ferries.'

It's soon time for the crew to get involved as they raise their hands in the air singing, 'life jackets, life jackets, they're right beneath your seat.' 

The pair then instruct those watching how to operate the life jacket.

'It clips together so easily just listen for the click,' sings the female.

'That means you've done it properly and you look so very hip.' 

That may be a matter of opinion.

The steward raps how to fix the life jacket on and blow the whistle, all out of sync

All you have to do is just 'listen for the click' says the stewardess, and that means you've done it right

The male then takes the lead when notifying of where the emergency exits are, complete with some cringeworthy dance moves that involve bouncing on the spot and hilarious hand signals.

But it only gets worse.

It's back to the captain, as he comes into shot singing 'now ladies, hey ladies,' while making what can only be described as an 'uncomfortable' facial expression.

However, rather than flirting, he is simply advising that 'sharp objects can't go on our slides, so leave those heels behind.'

The steward then bounces on the spot and uses amusing hand gestures to warn of the emergency exits

The emergency slide is then shown, at least in graphic form, as the stewardess demonstrates how, well, to slide down it.

The video then uses graphics to show how the staff can help passengers from wheeling their luggage, to using a resuscitator and defibrillator, as 'you name it, we have it.'

The star of the show then comes back, the captain, as he sings: 'So who would have thought that the Condor could bust out such good rhymes?'

The video is being broadcast  on all sailings between Poole and the Channel Islands.

He's back! The captain then makes a somewhat unnerving re-appearance as he warns ladies not use heels down the emergency slides

The idea was conceived and produced by Bournemouth-based Walker Agency, working closely with the Condor Ferries safety, marine operations and marketing teams.

Alicia Andrews, executive director – commercial at Condor Ferries, said: 'We're really proud of the new safety video, it's been a very fun project to work on, and we're delighted with the results. 

'Our brief was simple, we wanted something a little bit different, something that our passengers would sit up and take notice of, and which would appeal to all members of the family. We think that the rap, with the Good Times messaging does just that.

The stewardess demonstrates how passengers would use the emergency slide... not too difficult

'Ferry travel is very family-friendly, there are no restrictions on the amount of luggage you can bring – you can pack everything in to your car, and off you go. 

'We hope that our passengers, whether they are frequent travellers or joining us for the first time this summer will enjoy the video and their Good Times experience onboard Condor Liberation as we set sail to Jersey and Guernsey.'

However the video has been met with less-than positive comments by users on YouTube, where it has been hosted.

The staff are there to help with passengers' every need, according to the safety video

Liam Gilheany wrote: 'I want to pour lava into my ears,' while James Lund added: 'I'd want to jump into the harbour if this is for real.' 

Nathan Thomas is somewhat dubious as to the authenticity of the captain writing: 'I hope they keep a look out for fishing boats better - now they seem to have employed a stripper as a captain.'

Condor are believed to be the first ferry operator to produce an onboard safety video to feature a rap.

The release has coincided with the launch of its brand new state-of-the-art Condor Liberation with a new mission statement of 'Good Times.'

The video has been met with pleasure by senior executives at Condor Ferries
