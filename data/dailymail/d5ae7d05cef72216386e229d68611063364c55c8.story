A schoolboy plotting to carry out a ‘new Columbine’ school massacre asked his teacher which gun he would prefer to be shot with, a court heard yesterday.

The 16-year-old neo-Nazi fanatic is said to have made the chilling threat as he plotted to bomb two schools, a university, mosque, cinema and council buildings in his hometown of Loughborough.

The boy questioned his teachers about guns and researched firearms on the internet while at school, the Old Bailey heard.

Now 17, he was arrested in February 
for carrying a machete. When officers searched his home they discovered 
an arsenal including home-made bombs, as well as knives and guns.

The teenager, whose identity is hidden in this artistic drawing, idolised Hitler and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson, a court has been told

Yesterday, pupils and teachers from his secondary school told how the 
pupil, who cannot be named because of his age, was openly discussing 
mass killings.

A science teacher recalled him asking about guns and 
added: ‘He asked me which gun I would prefer to be shot with. He is 
aware I am a chemistry teacher, and he was also keen to ask questions 
about explosives and chemicals.’

Prosecutor Max Hill said the 
accused, who has Asperger’s syndrome, had a book called Spree Killers 
about massacres at schools and colleges in the UK and U.S.

Mrs Hill said in the months before his arrest the boy became increasingly anti-social and racist.

Jurors were also told the teenager boasted of attending an EDL rally in Leicester in February 2012.

Prosecutor Max Hill QC said the defendant used Facebook’s private messaging service to discuss his targets with a friend.

In the week before his arrest in February, the boy wrote on Facebook Chat: 'I think I want to do it next April,' the court heard.

The jury have already been shown amateur videos showing the teenager and his two friends, also unnamed, testing petrol bombs made out of wine bottles, white spirit and lighter spirit, and socks or rags as the fuse.

Among 11,000 Facebook Chat messages, the teenager also discussed creating 'smoke-nades' with ping- pong balls and making 'acid-filled condoms' with a friend, the jury was told.

Mr Hill said: 'We suggest this material, from the mouths or keyboards of these young men themselves, gives the defendant away.

'Young he may be, sometimes less than entirely coherent he may be, but there are aspects of these Facebook chats which cannot be explained away as schoolyard banter.'

Mr Hill showed jurors a selection of newspaper clipping found, including a report of a 16-year-old boy who planned a killing spree.

He added: 'You can see the level of interest in atrocities, both domestic and foreign’, he said.

‘There is gunman kills 17 in church outrage, gunman kills dad, lad, 16, in massacre of kids plot - the list goes on.

‘You might find that quite chilling in the context of this case.’

The teenager and two other 17-year-old boys have already pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing petrol bombs and component parts of pipe bombs for the use of explosive devices.

A former classmate of the defendant, who cannot be identified, said his behaviour became 'uncontrollable at school' and began racially 
abusing other pupils.

In a police interview played to the 
jury at the Old Bailey, the teenager said he first met the alleged 
terror plotter in September 2011 when he seemed 'a nice, decent guy'.

'Through the year he started acting up,' he said.

Targets were alleged to include Loughborough University and five other sites in the area

'He said he supported types of terrorist groups like the IRA, EDL (English Defence League), and was quite racist as well.

'I
 didn’t think he was the right person to be hanging around with and I 
stopped talking to him.'

The boy, who is a prosecution witness in the 
trial, said he reported the defendant after he started using racist 
language towards his Asian friends in May last year.

'He was saying I wasn’t British because my family wasn’t born here,' he told police.

'I heard him under his breath call me a P*ki a few times.

'I was told he was quite a big racist and said offensive things to teachers. He was uncontrollable.

'Once I heard that I thought he’s not
 the type of person I need.'

In one incident the defendant became 'wound
 up' when he was accidentally tripped by a pupil, the witness said.

'He started getting really mad, raging at this person,' the boy said.

'He started calling him names and taunting him. People started getting really sick of him.'

Distanced himself: A former friend of the defendant told the jury he started to racially abuse pupils

The teacher said he had to issue regular reprimands to the teenager over his behaviour in class because of his bullying, and regular stream of racist remarks.

He said Columbine was one of the attacks the teen pointed out, adding: ‘He was encouraging me to look at the firearms, making a judgement whether it was a good gun.

‘He mentioned people that had carried out the attacks and referred to those people as not bad people.’

The teacher said the teenager was constantly disruptive in class, pushing other pupils around and abusing those who refused to do what he wanted.

‘He took pleasure in disruption and failed to get the point that qualification was a necessary part of growing up throughout the year’, he said.

‘I was not able to make him truly appreciate the value of education.

‘There were many incidents of defiance, and incidents of racial abuse, it has to be said.

‘With the incidents of racism, they were tirades of long drawn-out and frankly painful to listen to episodes of him going on about different people different religions and different orientations.’

He said the race hate began in October 2011, when the boy was just 15, ranting against Jewish people, Germans, and Muslims.

‘He seemed to believe people of the Muslim religion did not have a place in this country because of their religion’, he said.

‘With Jews, there didn’t seems to be a particular individual or someone singled out, this was just a blanket hatred of people who took that religion.’

He also said the defendant bullied one pupil because of German heritage.

The boy, now 17, is accused of stockpiling weapons, explosives, and a crossbow in preparation for a planned a killing spree in April next year.

He had a large Nazi Swastika flag hung on the wall in his bedroom, alongside a poster of Heath Ledger as the Joker, and also had a custom-made knife with a Swastika on the handle.

The defendant, who has Asperger’s syndrome, denies a charge of possessing items for the purpose, preparation and instigation of an act of terrorism.

The boy also denies one count of possessing a document or record containing information likely to be useful for a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, and a further count of possessing explosives in the form of component parts of IEDs.

The trial continues.
