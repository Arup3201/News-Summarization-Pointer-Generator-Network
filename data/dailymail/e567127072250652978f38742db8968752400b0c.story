Leicester have announced that lock Graham Kitchener has agreed a new contract with the Aviva Premiership club.

Kitchener, 25, is in his fourth season at the Tigers after joining them from Worcester in 2011.

His new deal comes just 24 hours after Leicester confirmed fresh terms at Welford Road for their Welsh fly-half Owen Williams.

Kitchener has also played for England Saxons and previously been part of England's senior squad, although he remains uncapped.

'"Kitch" has established himself as a key part of a very good group of second-row forwards in his four seasons here,' Leicester rugby director Richard Cockerill said.

'As well as developing his individual skills, he has taken on more responsibility within the squad, and we want to see him continue to grow as part of a group of young leaders here.

'He has been a very consistent performer for us in big matches in the Aviva Premiership and in Europe, and we believe he can get better and better here.'
