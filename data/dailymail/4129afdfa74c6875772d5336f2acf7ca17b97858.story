Man's best friend: Researchers found having a dog made people feel less isolated (file picture)

They are known as man’s best friend – but having a dog can help you socialise more with people too, says a study.

Researchers at the University of Chicago found having a dog made people feel less isolated, while other pets including cats, lizards and hamsters, had no effect.

Professor John Cacioppo told the American
 Association for the Advancement of Science’s conference: ‘We find that 
dogs are associated with less loneliness.

‘Unfortunately for cat owners, cats, reptiles and rodents aren’t associated with a difference.’

He added: ‘We didn’t determine what it was about a dog – but one of the things that dogs require that other pets don’t is that you have to walk them.

‘When you take them out and walk them you get exercise and you meet your neighbours. I don’t know about you, but I’ve met neighbours over the years through my children and my pets.’

He added: ‘I think my dog also likes me and that may be part of it. But it may not. I think this getting out, walking, talking to people could be sufficient for a dog’s health benefits relative to other pets.’

Chris Laurence, former veterinary director of Dogs Trust, said that when one dog stops to ‘talk’ to another dog, the owners stop to chat too.

He added: ‘If you are out with your dog, most people who are walking a dog will say “hello” at least, but other people without dogs just walk past.

‘In terms of reducing loneliness, dogs are more of a spur to people. You don’t take your cat to a training class.

‘Animals like rats are very intelligent and interact, but they don’t induce interactions with others.’

Mr Laurence, who is also a former director of the Feline Advisory Bureau, also echoed the professor’s comments about dogs being more loving than cats.

He said: ‘There is the old adage that you don’t own your cat – it owns you. Cats tend to interact when they want to, whereas dogs tend to interact when you want them to.’

There are other health reasons why dogs are man’s best friend.

For instance, a review of research by the American Heart Association suggested that pet owners have healthier hearts than other people – and dog owners particularly benefit.

This may be because of the necessity to go for walks, whatever the weather.

Studies show that dog owners walk more than other people, making them more likely to meet government guidelines on physical activity.

For instance, an Australian study found that dog owners walked for an average of five hours a week - compared with less than three hours for others.
