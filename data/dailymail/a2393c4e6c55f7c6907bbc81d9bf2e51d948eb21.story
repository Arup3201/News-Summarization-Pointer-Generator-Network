Is it a bird? Is it a plan? No, it's 867 people dressed as Superman.

Fans came together to smash the world record for the most people dressed as the comic book hero in one place.

Around 1,200 people wore Superman costume's to the Kendal Calling festival in the Lake District, but only 867 were present for the Guinness World Record official count.

However, the result soundly beat the previous record of 556 people.

as Superman.'

Bhupendra Maisuria, director of Escapade, added: 'We were stunned by the 
incredible reaction of festival goers who really took up the mantle and
