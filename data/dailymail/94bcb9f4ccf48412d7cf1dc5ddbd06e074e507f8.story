Leicester are keen on signing Tottenham defender Kyle Naughton this month.

The former Sheffield United full back is on the periphery of Mauricio Pochettino's first-team plans.

And Foxes boss Nigel Pearson has identified Naughton as one of the men he wants to bolster his relegation-threatened squad.

Persuading Pochettino to part with Naughton will not be a problem.

The defender is one of a number of players the Spurs boss is prepared to sell this month as he looks to stamp his authority on the squad in the transfer window.

The 26-year-old has been sent off twice in 10 appearances for Tottenham this season.
