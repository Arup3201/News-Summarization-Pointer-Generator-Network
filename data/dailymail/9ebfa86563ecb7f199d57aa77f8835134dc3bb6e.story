With polished silverware still in the kitchen drawers and outdated toiletries sitting on a dusty dressing table, these incredible photographs show a perfectly preserved home that was abandoned by its owners decades ago.

From the retro patterned wallpaper to the well out-of-date food in the pantry, the dilapidated home in Ontario, Canada, is a remarkable time capsule.

An urban explorer called Dave made the stunning discovery while he was looking at abandoned properties in his home province - and documented his findings on his website Freaktography. 

'The sight upon entering this house was eerie, breath-taking and weird,' he said. 'There is the usual smell of decay and years of abandonment that one comes to expect in this hobby.'

Dave found musical instruments, including a gramophone and a stereo system that would have been state-of-the-art at the time, books and family photographs - offering a tantalizing glimpse into the lives of the former occupants.  

'This family loved music': Dave found it 'unsettling' to see so many personal possessions left behind in the living room. An acoustic guitar remains in its case on the coffee table, several record players sit atop an old lift top record player as well as a stack of vinyl records

The worst decayed room, pictured, in the abandoned house in Ontario, Canada, featured a red couch and two plush chairs. Dave says he keeps the locations of his finds secret so they can remain preserved

Dave found an acoustic guitar in the living room as well as a multitude of other music paraphernalia. 'Between the guitar, piano, recorder, harmonicas and the record players and eight-tracks that I found, I could see music was obviously a huge part of this family’s life,' he said

A tiny television sits in the corner of one of the rooms, as well as a wooden bureau and display cabinet full of objects. Dave said: 'Very few of the abandoned houses you will encounter have all of the previous occupant’s belongings'

A clock sits atop the desk, permanently stopped at 3.43 and other trinkets include mugs and candles. A china cabinet, left, is stocked with the essentials for entertaining guests with shelves full of plates, bowls, glasses and decorative teacups

Inside the drawers of the desk are two sets of still polished silver, but some drawers on the cabinets would not open after years of remaining closed. 'The sight upon entering this house was eerie, breath-taking and weird,' said Dave

Glasses and floral teacups (one complete with a knitted tea cosy) remain stacked on their shelves ready to be used. Dave discovered the perfectly preserved home while he was surveying abandoned homes in his home state

A shaving kit, once used by the man of the house, remains intact on a dirty dressing table, as well as shoe shine polish and jewelry cleaner

A fully stocked pantry, left, gives a glimpse into the eating habits of the family, with several packets of Jell-O on the top shelf as well as cooking ingredients, including spices and baking powder and right, a china cat sits on a shelf in the kitchen

The main room in the house is dominated by the dining table, still with its table cloth and chairs in place and near it is a hutch with the cabinet and desk stocked with crockery and cutlery

Another living room, with paint and wallpaper starting to peel away, features a piano and a small table and chair set near the windows 

In a bedroom, Dave found a dresser, inside which were lots of family albums. On top there with a photo of a small child in an old frame, a comb and a hairbrush. He said: 'It was an interesting scene that I really wanted to capture'

He also found a box stuffed with hats, jewelry, pictured, and photo albums. He said: 'I opened some but others I left – over time when things stay in one place, they become a part of that place so moving a photo album meant ruining that photo album'

An open drawer shows illustrates tins and a pile of newspapers. Dave said: 'It was as though every single newspaper ever delivered to the house had been kept and placed into a box'

Dave said he found the bedroom almost impossible to shoot as it was so full of possessions. The family who lived in the house were clearly well-read as shelves were piled high and in every nook of the house  

Dave said: 'Each room upstairs is full of books, books on addiction, books about Jesus,  books about war, books about peace and magazines, and then even more newspapers.' Pictured, a woman's handbook on gynecology and one called 'Pornographics'

The study is packed wall to wall with books, papers and trinkets. 'In and around this desk were stacks of magazines and files and binders stacked to the ceiling,' Dave said. 'Underneath and on either side were filing cabinets packed full of paperwork and bills and medical files'

A book about coping with death, left, sits on the bed, and right, the gramophone was concealed in a wooden box with a doily draped on it

Dave was amazed to discover an early-20th century gramophone, complete with a turn crank on the side, replacement needles and wipes to clean the records. He said: 'I was so taken aback  that I didn’t even think to drop the needle, turn the crank and let the music play from her speakers one more time – this is my biggest regret'

A view from the top of the staircase leading into a bedroom, which contains a small TV, and leads into another bedroom. In one of the bedrooms, Dave said he opened a dresser drawer to find it packed with neatly organized fur scarves and cuffs for coats
