It has been illegal to drink alcohol on the Tube in London for seven years, but there is now a new way to enjoy cocktails on your commute.

A new bar opens today in an old abandoned air raid shelter from World War Two and it has been designed to resemble a vintage Underground station.

Based in Carnaby Street, Cahoots, will transport guests back to the 1940s, in a bid to bring Soho’s illicit and nocturnal escapades from the era back to life.

Enjoy being able to drink on the tube! Cahoot is a 1940s themed bar opening in Soho, and transports guests back to the period, with an old tube carriage for seating, sandbags and classic cocktails

Club owners Charlie Gilkes and Duncan Stirling tried to keep the bar as authentic to how the underground would have been in the 1940s, complete with the a wooden staircase entrance in homage to the old wooden escalators

From quirky cocktails served in clocks, to the authentic vintage signs, the centrally-located bar is the brainchild of Charlie Gilkes, 30, and Duncan Stirling, 33. 

The pair are owners of the Bunga Bunga bar and Maggie’s nightclub, which is inspired by Margaret Thatcher and thought that as the Soho venue was used in the war as an air raid shelter, it would prove to be a poignant spot to host the bar.

Charlie Gilkes of Inception Group said: 'We decided to open Cahoots, after having been inspired by true events that occurred in post-war Britain, and the venue's own extraordinary heritage. 

'The site was formerly Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers.

'It was also used as a bomb shelter during World War II and the wartime membership book contains names such as Burgess, Maclean, Anthony Blunt and Buster Crabbe. With Cahoots we loved the idea of bringing the history of the place back to our visitors.'

First timers are greeted by the station master, in character, at the entry kiosk and issued a ‘day ticket’ to enter the underground station

During the war a number of disused underground stations were used for shelter and inhabitants would bring their own nick-nicks and furnishings to feel at home during the raids.

To bring Cahoots to life, the pair recreated the vintage tube carriage using real London Underground fabrics, and leather from the period. 

They also aimed to make the entrance as authentic as possible to the wooden escalators that would have been used in the stations.   

If the decor is not enough to inspire a visit, the extensive cocktail menu is an impressive eight pages long and vast amount on offer are priced £7-£9. 

Chose to indulge in Dig for Victory-style cocktails, drinks served in Thermos flasks, milk bottles, as well as new variations of old favourites.

Alternatively the impressive Cahoots signature cocktail is the Tanqueray No.TEN Station Clock, which has a working face, and serves eight for £150. 

Bottoms up! You are spoilt for choice at Cahoots with eight pages of cocktails including the Give Peas a Chance (£10).  Inspired by gimlets, it is made from  Goose Original vodka, garden peas, lime juice, basil, agave syrup, and a Moët & Chandon Brut Impérial NV champagne foam

When you arrive at the Soho location, you are greeted by staff who issue you with a ticket to board the underground tube carriage 

Even the staff are dressed in character, with 1946 outfits, accents, nicknames with back stories as to how they came to work in the bar.  

Another interesting feature about the bar is the dimly-lit cosy air raid bunker seating booth, which is perfect for dates due to the snug proximity. 

The surroundings will be brought to life by 1940s- style singer and musicians, with possible cabaret events being put on in the near future. 

Cahoots is opening today in Kingly Court, W1, opens on Thursday 5 March, with free entry, and opportunities to reserve tables via the website.

As well as serving classic cocktails, black market liquor and post-war favourites are also available, in particular rum and gin based drinks are furtively knocked back from old mugs, hip flasks, vintage milk bottles and tins

Those in groups are able to pass time with the Cahoots signature sharer cocktail, ‘The Tanqueray No. TEN Station Clock’, served in an actual clock with a working clock face

The cocktail list features Dig-for-victory drinks, which fit perfectly in with 1940s theme of the bar, which includes bunting, sandbags and fabric used for old underground tubes

Cahoots is located on the former site of Tatty Bogle, an out-of-hours drinking club, first opened in 1917 by a group of Scottish officers. It was used as a bomb shelter during World War II

During the war, several disused underground stations were turned into air raid shelters and Londoners would transform the spaces into a ‘home away from home’, with their own nick-nacks and furnishings

The 1940s-style drinks are served in Thermos flasks, milk bottles, and to do a modern twist on classic favourites
