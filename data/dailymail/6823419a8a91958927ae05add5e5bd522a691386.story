A schoolgirl has caused controversy online by getting a police officer to jokingly arrest her boyfriend just so she could ask him to prom.

The girl named Stephanie last week had a sheriff's deputy come into the cafeteria at Knight High School in Palmdale, California and handcuff Davyeon in front of his friends.

He was then led outside into the parking lot where his girlfriend was holding a sign which read: 'Dayveon, can I cuff you at prom?' 

Shock: Davyeon shows his shock as a sheriff walks into the cafeteria at Knight School in Plamdale, California, and handcuffs him in front of his friends 

Paraded around: He is then escorted through the quad in front of classmates to the parking lot, where a patrol car is waiting 

Despite the initial shock, he said yes. 

He later tweeted: 'Lol it was crazy because I was eating lunch then the sheriff came in there and got me.' 

When another social media user asked him whether he had actually been arrested, Davyeon said: 'Nah lol it was just a promposal as soon as I opened the door the poster was there.'

The stunt was regarded as romantic by some, but other slammed her actions, with one person calling her the 'worst girlfriend in history.' 

One person wrote on Twitter: 'This is not ok at alll.' 

Another added: 'Is this real? If so did you consider the possible legal, emotional and social consequences of something so reckless.'

Others said it was the 'cutest thing they had ever since' and felt sorry for those who had also asked their dates out the same day.  

The Daily Mail Online have contacted the school for comment.  

Bold move: As he approached the vehicle, he saw a poster which read: 'Davyeon, can I cuff you at prom?'' Surprisingly he said yes

Reveal: Stephanie then posted the collage of pictures on Twitter. The images were created with a mixture of praise and abuse 

Reassurance: Davyeon shared his surprise with some confused followers who asked him what happened 

Criticism: One person said the act by the girl was 'reckless' and accused her of not considering the potential consequences 

'Worst girlfriend ever': One Twitter user was very damning of the stunt 

Could not be topped: One classmate said they felt bad for anyone else who had asked their date out as the pair 'stole their moment'
