Police have released footage from a patrol car's dashcam showing an allegedly drunk driver sobbing and apologizing after she plowed down a young family as they crossed the street.

Cassandra Grammel, 24, allegedly ran a red light at an intersection in Delray Beach, Florida on October 6 and knocked over Daniel and Kelley Heneghan, their four-year-old daughter and one-year-old son - before driving away from the scene moments later.

'I'm sorry!' Grammel says repeatedly on 
the dash-cam video as officers ask her how much she had been drinking 
before handcuffing her and leading her away.

Apologies: Cassandra Grammel cries and apologizes in footage caught on a patrol car dash cam after she plowed down a family and then sped away from the scene. Police found her in her crashed car nearby

Grammel was apprehended by police after she fled the scene and crashed her Honda Accord into traffic signs less than a mile away, according to a police report, the Sun Sentinel reported.

Officers found her sitting in her car and crying with the windshield smashed. Her blood alcohol level was nearly three times the legal limit and the report noted that she smelled of alcohol.

During a road sobriety test, she 'almost fell over at times' and 'often looked at me with a blank stare 
while I was speaking with her', according to a report from the officer at the scene.

Breath tests found her blood alcohol content was .263 and .265, according to the report. Florida's legal limit is .08.

Remorse: She initially told officers she had one drink before admitting she'd had a few with vodka in them

In the footage, she can be heard claiming that she just had one drink before changing her story, admitting that she'd had a few drinks with vodka in them.

She admitted to hitting the family and driving away, the report said.

Mr Heneghan, who was on holiday from New Jersey with his family, suffered a broken leg and needed surgery. His wife suffered a concussion and scrapes and was also treated at hospital.

The children were in a stroller that rolled into a bush after their parents were hit. They were not hurt.

Arrested: 24-year-old Grammel, left in her mug shot and right, was charged with DUI causing serious injury and hit and run and spent nearly a month and a half in prison before posting bail

'It's a miracle that the kids are OK,' Jenny Nelson, who was having ice cream nearby, told the Palm Beach Post. 'I don’t know how the car missed the stroller. They didn’t have a scratch on them.'

Grammel was arrested and charged with DUI causing serious injury and hit and run.

County records show she spent nearly a month and-a-half in jail before being released on $10,000 bail.
