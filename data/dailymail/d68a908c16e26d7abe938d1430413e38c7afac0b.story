Harry Potter author JK Rowling is set to release her second crime novel under the pen name of Robert Galbraith.

The book, called Silkworm, will be released on June 19th, according to publishers, and will be a sequel of the number one bestseller The Cuckoo's Calling.

Her latest work will again feature private detective Cormoran Strike, a war veteran who is hired to investigate a supermodel's supposed suicide.

Crime novel: The book will be the second the 48-year-old author has written under the name Robert Galbraith

It will see Strike and his assistant, Robin Ellacott, unravelling the death of writer Owen Quine after they are asked to investigate his disappearance.

The pair then uncover a damning manuscript with the details of a number of Quine's associates, who are described in a negative way.

The publisher describes it as 'a compulsively readable crime novel with twists at every turn'.

Popular: The Cuckoo's Calling became an international best seller last year after the author's true identity was revealed

The new description reads: 'At first, Mrs Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few days – as he has done before – and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.

'But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realises.

'The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows.

'If the novel were to be published, it would ruin lives – meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced.

'When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer.'

The 48-year-old had aimed to keep her crime writing venture a secret, but the pseudonym was made public by a solicitor.

The lawyer has since been fined and the author was paid damages, which she gave to charity.

At the time, she said: 'I had hoped to keep this secret a little longer. It has been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation, and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name.'

It is Rowling's third novel for adults, the first being Casual Vacancy, which was released in 2012.
