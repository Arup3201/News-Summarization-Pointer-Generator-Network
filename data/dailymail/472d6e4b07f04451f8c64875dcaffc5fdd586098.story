Contents of a getaway car driven by the man suspected of kidnapping college student Hannah Graham have been revealed as police faced criticism this week over their handling of the case.

Jesse Matthew has been charged with abduction with intent to defile following Miss Graham's disappearance on September 13 from the Downtown Mall in Charlottesville, Virginia. 

Matthew fled to Texas while he was a 'person of interest' last month but was later found by police camping on a Galveston beach and arrested. 

The contents of the fugitive's Nissan Sentra were revealed by police on Tuesday and included an ashtray overflowing with cigarette butts, a Charlottesville detective's business card, a cassette tape with Jesus written on the front and an envelope containing a cross.

Jesse Mattew's car revealed details about his journey from Virginia to Texas and included a cassette tape with the word Jesus on the front and a Charlottesville detective's card

The yellow envelope had the words: 'Open this envelope first before you read my letter. Enclosed: 3 Powerful Faith tools to release God's power.'

No evidence of Miss Graham was found in the vehicle, police said. Matthew is now in custody in Virginia. 

Matthew was scheduled to appear in court this Thursday on the abduction charge and reckless driving charges. The cases were postponed until December.

Matthew took the car from his sister and fled Virginia on September 21 after walking into the Charlottesville police station with family members and asking to speak to a detective.

Police were still trying to fill in gaps in the timeline from the night that Jesse Matthew was last seen on surveillance footage with University of Virginia student Hannah Graham at 1.40am in the downtown area.

At a briefing earlier on Monday, investigators asked people who knew Matthew, a former college football lineman and sometime cab driver, to come forward with information so that they can develop a better profile of him. 

This week, dozens of people continued to scour hundreds of square miles in Albemarle County, through woodland and heavy brush, for the missing 18-year-old sophomore.

For the first time ever in Virginia, an aerial drone was being used to search for the missing teen.

Charlottesville's police chief said on Monday that it's important not to rush the case against Matthew, despite coming under fire for some of his decisions.

Chief Timothy Longo said on Monday that new information meant investigators believe Graham is in Virginia which has stopped them widening their search beyond state lines.  

Asked whether he expects to find Miss Graham alive, Chief Longo said: 'Every day that passes is not a good sign. Every day that passes translates more to recovery than rescue. But at the end of the day, we still have to find Hannah Graham.'

He added that he thinks about the case constantly.

'I lay in bed at night going over what have we done differently, what could we do differently?' he said.

Matthew was arrested last month after fleeing the state of Virginia. He was found camping on a beach in Galveston, Texas. Pictured above on September 26, being escorted by FBI off a plane back in Virginia

The Charlottesville police department has come under fire for allowing Matthew to flee the station after he arrived last month to talk to detectives and asked for a lawyer. 

Matthew's apartment had just been searched and while not a suspect at the time, he was considered a 'person of interest.'

He left the police without being charged and sped away, prompting police to issue an arrest warrant for reckless driving, authorities said. 

While Matthew was a fugitive, Virginia police added a charge of abduction with intent to defile in Miss Graham's disappearance, and he was arrested several days later on a Texas beach.

'We caught some criticism when Mr. Matthew walked out that door on that Saturday afternoon. People couldn't understand: "How do you just let the guy walk out the door?''' Chief  Longo said on Monday.

'We made a commitment to honor certain constitutional protections that people have in our criminal justice system, and as frustrating as it is, we want to be very careful to get it right, not to rush to judgment.'

Chief Longo said the goal of asking for more information about Matthew was to try to figure out areas he may have been familiar with as they assess where to focus their search.

'What are the places where he's most comfortable? ... If you were to take someone against their will, you're going to take them to someplace likely where you're comfortable. You're not going to go out in the dark and hope for the best,' the chief said. 

Authorities said that forensic evidence connects Matthew to the 2009 slaying of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old Virginia Tech student. 

Chief Longo declined to discuss the evidence against Matthew or whether he might be charged in the Harrington case.
