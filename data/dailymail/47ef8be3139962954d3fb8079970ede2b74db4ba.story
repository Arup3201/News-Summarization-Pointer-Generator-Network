A proud father live tweeted the birth of his daughter to keep family and friends up to date with developments.

Paul Lorente updated his Twitter followers for almost 24 hours after his wife, Alana, 29, went into labour and gave birth at the Burnley Birthing Unit in Lancashire.

Mr Lorente posted his tweets with the hashtag #PrincessBatman – the couple’s nickname for Mrs Lorente’s bump.

Mr Lorente says family and friends were 'glued' to their screens waiting for updates

And, he spared his followers no details in the hours before Eva Grace, who has Down’s syndrome, arrived.

Tweets he posted included: ‘Just been told we are 4-5 cm dilated. We are being moved to birth suite’ and ‘Pushing’.

He eventually announced his daughter’s birth, on May 12, by tweeting: ‘#PrincessBatman born in the pool at 14:27’.

Mr Lorente, who lives with his family in Accrington, Lancashire, said: ‘Both me and my wife have big families. We both have lots of friends and we both have an extended church family.

‘We'd told them all that Alana was being induced and everyone said they wanted updates.

‘I just thought that setting up a Twitter account would be the easiest way to do it so that way people could just click the link and see where we were up to without inundating us with phone calls and text messages.’

Mr Lorente admits that there were times during the labour when his wife was not pleased to see him on Twitter

The Princess Batman hashtag has now been
 viewed more than 1,500 times and the couple's friends and family say 
they were 'glued' to their screens.

Mr Lorente, who works as an insurance claims handler, said: ‘We called her Princess Batman because we wanted her real name to be a surprise and because we knew that she had Down’s syndrome, I didn't want people thinking of her as the “Down’s syndrome baby”. I thought she'd prefer a cool alter ego.

‘I had thought that it would be a good idea but I didn't think it would be quite that popular.’

Mr Lorente decided to tweet during the labour and birth as a way of keeping friends and family updated on his wife and daughter's progress

Mr Lorente says they named the bump Princess Batman as they didn't want their unborn baby being known as 'the Down's syndrome baby'

But Mrs Lorente, who works as a buyer at a shop in Blackburn, admitted there were times during the labour when seeing her husband tweeting was less than welcome.

The couple said part of the decision to Tweet was because there can be complications after the birth of a child with Down’s syndrome.

Mrs Lorente said: ‘When we were first told she had Down’s syndrome, I did panic and think: “How can I look after a child with special needs?”

‘But then I realised, all children have “special needs” that need to be met by their parents and so she would be no different at all.’

And she said social media helped her through her pregnancy as she found a Facebook group called 'Future of Downs' where parents share stories.

Mr Lorente sent all his tweets with the hashtag #PrincessBatman
