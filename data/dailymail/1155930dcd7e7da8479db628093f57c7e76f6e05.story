Sheryl Crow accompanied Lance Armstrong on a trip to receive an illicit blood transfusion and later told federal investigators all about it, it has been claimed.

A new book, entitled 'Wheelmen: Lance Armstrong, the Tour de France and the Greatest Sports Conspiracy Ever' claims the musician traveled in a private jet to Belgium with Armstrong for the 2004 procedure.

'Rather than try to hide the transfusion from her, Armstrong was completely open about it,' authors Reed Albergotti and Vanessa O'Connell write.

Albergotti and O'Connell, who are both Wall Street Journal reporters, claim that Armstrong wasn't fussed if Crow saw what was going on, explaining it was something all cyclists did, according to The New York Daily News, which published an excerpt of the book today.

'He trusted that Crow would have no desire to tell the press or anyone else about the team's doping program.'

The couple, who were briefly engaged, were just dating at the time.

But Crow didn't spill the beans about the overseas trip until five years after their relationship ended in 2006.

That's when federal investigators launched the criminal probe into the apparent Tour de France superstar.

The latest account claims Crow informed on Armstrong after Food and Drug Administration criminal investigator Jeff Novitzky gave her a proffer agreement, protecting her from criminal prosecution if she told the truth.

A representative for Crow did not offer a comment to the Daily News.

Blood transfusions boost athletes' endurance by increasing the number of oxygen-carrying red blood cells in their bodies.

These were just one of the many tools Armstrong used as well as banned substances to propell him to the top of his sport.

'Wheelmen,' due out next Tuesday, also discusses what Armstrong's other friends and supporters knew of his drug taking.
