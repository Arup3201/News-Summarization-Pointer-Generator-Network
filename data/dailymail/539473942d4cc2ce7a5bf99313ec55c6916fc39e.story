Gabriel Zakuani's three-year-old son, Trendy, was named partly because of his dad’s love of Twitter trending. One of the Peterborough centre-half’s daughters is named after Crewe Alexandra, despite him never having played for them. And he once appeared in a video for a Dizzee Rascal single, having met the rapper when they were teenagers taking part in a version of Ready, Steady, Cook. Conventional, he isn’t.

On footballing duty for his international side, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Zakuani, 28, feared for his safety as the team bus was rocked by rival fans, then pelted with rocks in Malawi. And he has been bewildered in Libya by gunfire during training and military helicopters buzzing around during a competitive match.

And while the defender, who was born in Kinshasa in 1986 and then raised in London from six, routinely plays in front of crowds of about 6,500 in League One, at London Road, he is about to experience an Africa Cup of Nations (ACN) where the crowds and fervour will verge on the hysterical.

‘People associate Zaire with wars, extreme poverty and two sporting events — the Rumble in the Jungle and Zaire being the first [sub-Saharan] African team at the World Cup,’ he said. ‘The national team is something the whole country follows and it dictates the mood. Win and there’s a party until the next game. Lose and it’s the opposite. Football is the [barometer of] happiness.’

Zakuani is one of three English-based players in DRC’s squad for the ACN, which runs from next Saturday until February 8 and is being staged in Equatorial Guinea after original hosts Morocco withdrew through fears from Ebola. West Bromwich Albion midfielder Youssouf Mulumbu, 27, and Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie, 25, are the others.

‘On a football night, the build-up alone [in DRC] is crazy,’ said Zakuani. ‘Training sessions are packed, 40,000 will come, singing, dancing, getting excited by good skills. After the session they’ll try to rush the pitch. They want pictures for their Facebook. We need a military escort to get anywhere!’

Zakuani joined Fulham from Leyton Orient for £1m in 2006 but made only two appearances for the club

DRC are in Group B in the ACN, up against Zambia, Tunisia and Cape Verde. Zakuani is optimistic DRC can shock a few people, not least because they emerged from a tough qualifying group behind Cameroon and Ivory Coast. The latter are ANC favourites and Cameroon are among the contenders.

The DRC squad found out they had qualified in unusual circumstances in November, while crossing Africa in a jumbo jet en route from Congo to Belgium. ‘We had beaten Sierra Leone in our final qualifier but were waiting for other results to see if we had got the place available for best third-place team,’ said Zakuani.

‘Mulumbu asks a stewardess if we can get the pilot to call to the ground and get someone to look on the internet for results. She says fine and off he goes and later comes back down the aisle with all the scores written down. We were through! Everyone on the plane screamed and cheered. We cracked open the champagne. It was a nine-hour flight and the same length celebration.’

Zakuani was born in Kinshasa, Zaire and moved to London as a young child

Zakuani came to Europe in 1994 when his dad, a translator, moved the family to London. ‘Gabi’ and his brother Steve both became attached to clubs, Gabi at Leyton Orient, Steve with Arsenal before moving to the MLS.

Zakuani got to know Dizzee Rascal when they both lived in east London, upcoming teenaged stars in their fields. ‘I started at Orient and he was from Bow and big in the area. Me and Dizzee would be making the headlines each week for the Hackney Gazette. I was the footballer coming through [around 2003] and Dizzee was getting nominated for the Mercury Prize.

‘There was a local version of Ready, Steady, Cook and we were invited to take part and became close, inseparable for a time.’ 

Zakuani moved from Orient to Fulham, then on loan to Stoke, where he was playing in 2007 when a late-night call from Dizzee ended in him starring in the video for the single, Flex.

Defender Zakuani has been with Peterborough for most of the past seven years

It was around this time Zakuani was living near Crewe, following the fortunes of the club — and becoming attached to the moniker. He and his partner, Shanice, named their fourth child, now seven months old, Croux-Alexis.

‘She’s sort of named after Crewe Alexandra because I lived near there and my wife loves the sound of it, also I’m a big fan of Alexis Sanchez so it fits,’ said Zakuani.

Croux-Alexis has two older sisters, Destiny and Heaven, as well as brother Trendy, now three. ‘We were looking at names and it was at a time when I was very active on Twitter and my missus was into fashion,’ said Zakuani. ‘Trending and trendy made sense.’

Zakuani has been with Peterborough for most of the past seven years aside from a six-month hiatus with Greek side Kalloni from last January. He was going to go there on an 18-month contract but ‘something felt not right’ and he signed for six. ‘That was a good decision,’ he said.

He returned to Posh in June on a two-year deal and it was there that he met Bolasie, who was playing for Plymouth. ‘We were opponents, defender and attacker,’ said Zakuani. ‘Then early in the game he says to me he used to come to my house when I was a kid and I was thinking, “What’s this wind-up?”

‘During the game, he carried on talking about the house where I grew up, then started name-checking my brothers and sisters! I asked my mum and dad about it afterwards and it turned out the Bolasies did come to our house back then. The families know each from back in Congo! Me and Yannick have been close ever since.’

The pair have shared some memorable trips, including to Libya, which Zakuani says ‘stands at No1 for craziness’.

He adds: ‘Training was like being in a war zone with gunshots around you. The sign at the hotel said “No guns allowed”. There were metal detectors to get through the door.

‘A helicopter hovered over the pitch during the game — low! We drew and at the end were told to wait in the centre circle for our own safety until the stadium emptied. Malawi was another interesting one. Stones pelted at the bus, opposition fans rocking it. We lost 2-1.’

As for ACN 2015, Zakuani, having been part of a team who beat Ivory Coast away in qualifying, says DRC can believe in progress: ‘Why not? Ivory Coast are favourites, but we’ve beaten them. We got the last ticket to the party. Stranger things have happened.’
