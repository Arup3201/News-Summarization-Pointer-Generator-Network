Jose Mourinho has insisted that Tottenham's European exit on Thursday night will not hurt them in Sunday's Capital One Cup final.

Spurs lost 2-0 to Fiorentina as the Serie A side progressed to the last 16 of the Europa League but Mourinho does not believe that will affect the outcome at Wembley.

'The physical side I don't think so because I don't they will play with the team that played yesterday (Thursday),' said Mourinho.

'They can change all those players so I don't think the physical side is a point.

'To play yesterday (Thursday) was good for them because they play with players who aren't playing in the final.' 

Nemanja Matic will miss Sunday's game because of suspension after being given a two-game ban for the red card he picked up for pushing Burnley's Ashley Barnes to the ground last weekend.

The midfielder's ban was reduced by one match by the FA but Mourinho and Chelsea had hoped it would be completely overturned after Matic reacted to poor challenge from the former Brighton man.

Asked about the situation, Mourinho said: 'If I give you my views, it's bad for me. I can't give you my views because it's bad for me.

'If I speak again about the Matic situation, I promise I will be in big trouble. I can't talk (about Ashley Barnes).'

Diego Costa has also come under the spotlight for his physical style this season and was banned for three games after stamping on Liverpool's Emre Can in the semi-final second leg.

Mourinho admits that his star striker needs to be wary on Sunday and in each game he plays from now on. 

'He has to be careful, but not with his behaviour,' said Mourinho. 

'He has to be careful because of other players and, as a consequence, the way referees look at him. Not because of how he has played since arriving in England. He has done very well.'

Chelsea won the League Cup 10 years ago in Mourinho's first season in charge, a victory which began a spell of success for the west London club.

This time the Portuguese insists he is simply focused on winning his first trophy since returning to Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2013.

Diego Costa must be careful because of the way referees view him, according to his manager Mourinho

'At this moment I'm not thinking. It's the only moment since I arrived in July 2013, the first time I don't think about the future of this club. 

'I just think about the moment, not the future. I don't think about the consequences. I just think about this game. We have a final to win on Sunday and nothing else matters.

'I have affinities with every competition. I respect every competition. It would be easy now because we lost against Bradford to say we didn't take the FA Cup seriously, but we did. 

'Probably lots of teams follow us since 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 when we took the League Cup as a real competition, a real challenge, and we were trying to reach finals and to win. 

'For sure, lots of clubs are chasing us. In the semi-final against Liverpool a couple of months ago, we and Liverpool played at the maximum of our potential. We respect every competition.

'Chelsea cannot win everything every season. If you want to do that, you have to change countries to one where the competition is not so hard and to win titles is an obligation.

'Chelsea in the last 10 years won just the League Cup twice. Many times they were at Wembley, winning FA Cups, and won Premier League and European competitions. Chelsea have done very well. 

'Now, with a new team and people who were not with dozens of finals at Wembley, will try and bring this new generation of players and this new team to make Wembley something normal for us, normal in the sense that we will try and get there year after year.

'I don't think about consequences. I don't think that, if you win the Cup final, you win the league or vice versa. I don't feel connections. 

'I feel this is the way I want to do it, and the players the same, it's a game we have to play, a final. After that, the Capital One Cup is over. 

'If you go home with the cup and a medal, perfect. Monday is another day. Tuesday we have to train. Wednesday we have to play. No time to think about consequences. 

'It's a final we have to play and a final we have to win. We stay in a hotel near Wembley. It would be more than an hour from our hotel. 

'It's for sure less than 45 minutes from where we will be staying, so it's just to have the players on the bus for less time.”'
