The distraught brother of Reeva Steenkamp told how her death had left a 'space missing inside all of the people that she knew', as over a hundred friends and family gathered for a private funeral.

The ceremony, held in MIss Steenkamp's home town of Port Elizabeth's, took place at the same time as her boyfriend Oscar Pistorius appeared in court in the South African capital Pretoria charged with her murder.

Police officers stood guard at the entrance to the building as mourners started to stream in to the crematorium two hours before the ceremony started.

‘Describing the service, he said: 
‘Everyone is sad, understandably.

'But at certain points we were smiling 
while remembering Reeva because we only have good memories of her.

'I think that was what we were all thinking.’

There was anger among the mourners 
with some calling for a harshest of sentences to be handed to Pistorius,
who has been charged with her murder.

'Without a doubt. He's a danger to the public. He'll be a danger to witnesses. He must stay in jail.

'He's
already shown how dangerous he can be for what he did to Reeva,' said 
Gavin Venter, an ex-jockey who worked for Reeva's father.

After the hour long ceremony Reeva 
Steenkamp's uncle Mike, brother Adam and sister Sharon made few brief 
comments to the press.  All three were red-eyed from crying.

Mike
Steenkamp tried to see a lighter side to the family tragedy, saying:

happen.  Now we are together but there's only one thing missing.'

Then the distraught uncle burst into tears.

'Reeva
stood against abuse against women and that stand is more powerful now',
he added, 'Reeva represented a world of strength and people coming out 
of the church are stronger.'

Trial: The memorial service took place as Miss Steenkamp's boyfriend Oscar Pistorius appeared in court in Pretoria charged with her murder

While
most of the crowd of black-clad mourners declined to talk to reporters,
the Steenkamp's old family friend Tara Laing told of how she 'watched 
Reeva growing up'.

Mrs Laing
was asked whether, in her opinion, Reeva would have mentioned any 
relationship problems to the family.  She replied 'no.'

'Reeva was never that type of person to complain', Mrs Laing said.

'I
watched her growing up.  She would never complain or make her problems 
anyone else's. She would just get on with it and sort things out 
herself.'

Mrs Laing went on: 'Reeva never travelled down [to Port Elizabeth] with Oscar.  The family never met him.'

None of the Steenkamp family were willing to comment on Oscar Pistorius.

Also in attendance was 
rugby player Francois Hougaard, the South African international rugby 
player whose friendship with Miss Steenkamp may have caused tension 
between her and Pistorius.

He refused to comment.

There
were also a number of local political figures and South African 
celebrities who knew the model from her television work.

A van full of 
nuns from Miss Steenkamp's Catholic private school also turned up.

Addressing media before the 11am service, Miss Steenkamp's family insisted they would not answer questions about Pistorius.

However, some among the mourners were not so reticent.

Nancy
Sishlwayi, Port Elizabeth's deputy mayor and local secretary of the 
African National Congress' Woman's League said: "This cannot continue to
happen....to kill angels.  Reeva was an angel. She can't be killed.

'[Oscar] cannot stay with us.  He must be in court.  He must die in jail.  I am sorry to his family, but he is sick.

'A school friend of Miss Steenkamp's from
her time at the local, private, St. Dominic's Priory High School paid 
tribute to the model's friendliness - and her willingness to learn the 
local African language of Xhosa.

Khanyiswa Kawa said: "Everything about her - the reception she gave everyone was amazing.

'She was so vibrant. I remember she tried to be a part of us.  She made the time to learn my language which meant the world.'

Miss Steenkamp was shot three times through the bathroom door of the home she shared with Paralympic sprinter Pistorius.

It is alleged she locked herself 
inside the room because she was terrified following an argument while 
Pistorius strapped  on his prosthetic legs and walked seven metres 
before opening fire. He denys murder.
