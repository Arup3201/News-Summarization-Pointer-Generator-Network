They were a hardworking couple from the wartime generation  that never dreamt of claiming anything from the state.

But, despite paying taxes all their lives, when William Bullock's wife Barbara, 82, suffered a severe stroke that left her needing round-the-clock care, no help was forthcoming.

In a sickening example of authorities' reluctance to pay care home bills – even when legally obliged to do so – health officials ruled that the former church organist's nursing fees had to come out of the couple's savings.

Denied funding: Barbara Bullock suffered a severe stroke aged 82

It was only once they had paid more than £80,000 for Mrs Bullock's care – including selling their house – that it emerged she was entitled to state support for the £1,500-a-month fees.

After a five-year legal battle, her family have won back £80,000 made up of repaid fees and interest payments, but tragically Mr and Mrs Bullock both died before the claim was resolved.

Lawyers specialising in reclaiming nursing fees warned that a huge backlog of cases means other elderly people will die before justice is done and the NHS could face a bill for hundreds of millions of pounds.

Under English law, elderly people with assets worth more than £23,000 must pay for their residential care unless it is health-related.

But the Daily Mail's Dignity For The Elderly campaign has highlighted the unfairness for those who are wrongly told they are ineligible despite suffering Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease or a stroke.

Primary care trusts – which were responsible for funding 'continuing care' on the NHS until the role was given to clinical commissioning groups – interpreted national guidelines differently, resulting in a postcode lottery.

Mrs Bullock met her husband during the Second World War when he was serving with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and she worked in a post office.

After serving in Egypt and reaching the rank of lieutenant, Mr Bullock became an inspector of nuclear plants. The couple married in 1946 and settled in Cheshire.

Mrs Bullock remained fit and active into her 80s, swimming and playing bowls. But she suffered a huge stroke in 2004.

Paralysed on one side and unable to speak or feed herself, she moved into a nursing home. Social services told her daughter that as home-owners with reasonable savings the couple would have to fund the place themselves. Unaware that her health needs meant she was entitled to free care, they agreed to pay privately.

Two years later the couple's £200,000 semi-detached home had to be sold as Mr Bullock was struggling to manage on his own and Mr Bullock moved in with his daughter Margaret Sturt.

'It was an incredibly stressful time,' Mrs Sturt said. 'I was trying to look after my dad while running a business during the day and trying to get to see my mother as often as I could … my health suffered and we were left with no savings at all.'

In 2008 Mrs Sturt began a legal bid to reclaim the fees, but her mother died the next year aged 86 and her 90-year-old father died 15 months later.

'My father fought for his country, he and my mother paid all their taxes and never claimed anything from the State, and yet … they were totally let down,' Mrs Sturt said.

There are an estimated 60,000 outstanding claims from middle-class families who say relatives were wrongly denied free care.

Mrs Sturt's solicitor, Nick Turner, said: 'The system is in a state of disarray … The Government needs to step in – these cases have already caused much grief to families … and someone needs to have the decency to realise these delays just aren't good enough.'
