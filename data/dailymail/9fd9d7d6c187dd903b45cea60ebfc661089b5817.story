Locals described Mrs Yager as a philanthropist who donated money to several charities. 

LAPD Lieutenant John Radtke told reporters at the crime scene: 'We're still at the beginning of this. So, what we're doing is a very slow, methodical investigation ... we're looking for fingerprints, we're looking for footprints, we're looking for blood. 

'We're looking for anything that might help us identify the person who may have been involved in this crime.'

Officers of LA County Coroner's office removed Mrs Yager's body from the home where she was murdered

He added: 'People in this neighborhood care about this community. They pay attention to people coming and going, so of course we are interested in anyone who might have seen anything out of the ordinary yesterday or perhaps even the day before.' 

Lt Radtke said that Windsor Square was one of the most desirable places to live in Los Angeles with almost no violent crime.  

Carolyn Layport, a long-term friend of Mrs Yager, told the LA Times: 'I am shaking. She is going to be missed.'

Locals described Mrs Yager as a cat lover who would often help strays she would find on the street.

The LAPD confirmed that the 86-year-old widow died from multiple stab wounds.
