Maybe something slipped out of Disneyland's Haunted Mansion?

That's one explanation for a video of happy 'ghost' playing around after-hours in the park's surveillance footage.

As the footage suggests, the ghost is able to walk across grass and sidewalks without tourists in the way.

Though the surveillance footage was originally posted to YouTube in 2009, it's drawing fresh speculation in a new Reddit thread

As the Huffington Post notes, the spook even walks on the water. 

The video originally went up on YouTube in 2009, but is drawling speculation again in a new Reddit thread from user _littlehelll.

'Maybe they were still re-using vhs tapes and the static image came through from previous recordings. Like a lone janitor or something. It is compelling in any case,' speculated Reddit user Macaface.

'If I become a ghost when I die I'd probably cruise Disney for a couple years too,' offered RicDan.

Still others think it's the specter of Walt Disney.  

Some believe it could be the ghost of Walt Disney
