AC Milan are eyeing up a move for Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado as the Serie A side prepare for life without Mario Balotelli.

Balotelli's £16million move to Liverpool would leave Milan in the market for a new striker and may cause a domino effect that could see Tottenham misfit Soldado head for the San Siro.

Soldado has not been a success since his £26m move from Valencia last summer, Thursday night’s goal against Limassol notwithstanding.

Wanted: Balotelli (pictured) is on the verge of a £16million move to Liverpool

He is set to continue under new manager Mauricio Pochettino as understudy to Emmanuel Adebayor in a system with only one central striker. 

Vlad Chiriches is another who is available and Roma are interested if they sell centre-half Mehdi Benatia, who is closing in on a move to Bayern Munich after rejecting Manchester United.

Roma officials have been in England this week. They like Chiriches and have a familiar route of negotiation through Tottenham’s technical director Franco Baldini, but are also looking at Manchester City’s Matija Nastasic.

Pochettino has been chasing Villarreal defender Mateo Musacchio but have hit a snag unravelling the Argentine’s complicated ownership history, and are also considering Sevilla’s Federico Fazio, another Argentine.
