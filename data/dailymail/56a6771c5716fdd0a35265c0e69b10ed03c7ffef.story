A rare variety of butter favored by famed chef Thomas Keller can now be yours - for a whopping $49 per pound.

Animal Farm butter, which is produced by Diane St Clair in Orwell, Vermont, is made using the cream from her ten Jersey cows, which contains over 87per cent butterfat.

It's cultured for 24 hours with buttermilk from the farm, churned by hand into a deep yellow, and then kneaded by hand to work the fats.

While the majority of the butter is delivered to Mr Keller's restaurants, The French Laundry in California and New York's Per Se, a surplus is now being sent to Saxelby Cheesemongers in Manhattan, where non-chefs can purchase it in quarter-pound nubs. 

Saxelby is being provided with a limited supply of Animal Farm butter for just a few weeks in December, while French Laundry takes a seasonal break from business.

According to GrubStreet, the creamy butter sold at Saxelby comes sealed and unsalted in a 'completely unglamorous Ziploc bag'.

Ms St Clair, who started making butter on Animal Farm over ten years ago, produces just 100lbs of butter a week, ten months of the year, making the product extremely rare and precious.

Other than the shipments to Chef Keller's eateries, some of it is also sent to Chef Barbara Lynch's Boston restaurants, Menton and No 9 Park, well as to The Inn at Little Washington, in Virginia, owned by Chef Patrick O'Connell.

In a 2013 interview with the Napa Valley Register, Ms St Clair revealed that her butter caught the attention of Chef Thomas Keller after she sent him a sample and asked for his opinion.

The chef reportedly responded with: 'Who are you? It's the most amazing butter I ever tasted.'

What's more, he was so taken with the butter that he bought her entire inventory at the time, without even asking the cost.

Ever since then,  he has continued to server Animal Farm butter at both of his Michelin-starred restaurants.

Ms St Clair recently published a recipe book about how to use the butter and buttermilk from her dairy farm, and Chef Barbara Lynch offered a rave review.

'The first time I tasted Diane's butter, I was blown away,' she wrote in an endorsement of the book. 

'And when I later sampled her buttermilk, it was a revelation - gorgeous globs of that golden butter suspended in creamy, tangy buttermilk. Of course, I wanted to put it in everything'.
