At trial: Former newspaper tycoon Eddie Shah was cleared of rape charges last month

Former newspaper tycoon Eddy Shah was condemned last night for saying some young girls who were sexually assaulted by celebrities were ‘to blame’.

Mr Shah, cleared last month of raping an underage girl, said abuse of youngsters in the 1960s, 70s and 80s was a ‘technical thing’ because they ‘threw themselves’ at stars.

The 69-year-old said there was a  difference between ‘girls who just go out and have a good time’ and those ‘who actually get “raped” raped’.

He claimed Scotland Yard’s Operation Yewtree, set up following allegations of sex abuse by BBC DJ Jimmy Savile, is turning into a ‘witch hunt’.

Last night a woman abused by Savile at age 13 said Mr Shah’s comments ‘beggar belief’. And a mother-of-one assaulted by TV star Stuart Hall in the 1960s said the victims ‘were not liars’.

Mr Shah, who founded the now defunct newspaper Today in 1986, said: ‘Rape was a technical thing, below a certain age, but these girls were going out with the pop groups and becoming groupies and all the rest of it, and throwing themselves at them.

‘Young girls and young men have always wanted a bit of excitement. They want to appear adult and do adult things.’

Asked if he was implying underage victims were at fault, he said: ‘If we’re talking about girls who go out and just have a good time, then they are to blame.

'If we talk about people who happen to be out and actually get “raped” raped, then everything should be done against that.’

In the interview with BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Shah was asked if he thought Operation Yewtree was in danger of becoming a witch hunt. He said: ‘I think it’s developing into that.

‘It’s easy policing and it’s easy 
prosecutions. In a civilised society there’s got to be more checks and 
balances before these sort of accusations are used.’

Angered: Susan Harrison, who was a victim of Stuart Hall as a teenager, slammed Shah for describing Operation Yewtree as a 'witch hunt'

Mr Shah said he was helping a ‘very well-known person’, who is being investigated by Operation Yewtree, deal with the ‘horrible, horrible feeling’ of ‘emptiness about everything’.

He said he had felt similarly when he was wrongly accused of rape, adding: ‘Every night I worked out different ways of committing suicide to help me go to sleep.’

Mr Shah, who lives in Chippenham, Wiltshire, with his wife Jennifer, was found not guilty at the Old Bailey last month of raping a girl aged between 12 and 15.

Caroline Moore, 53, was abused by Jimmy Savile aged 13 at Stoke Mandeville hospital in 1971.
She said of Mr Shah’s claims: ‘It beggars belief that someone would say 
that . . . I would like to give him a good smack and tell him to think 
before speaking next time. These comments can cause a lot of pain and 
distress.’

Susan Harrison was 16 when TV 
presenter Stuart Hall lured her to BBC premises on the pretext of 
helping her record a song, before attacking her in his car.

The 61-year-old said: ‘It does anger 
me that it is described as a witch hunt when the police are just 
responding to genuine complaints.

‘Every case is dealt with on its own merits. In our case we were not liars, contrary to what was said about us.

‘The police are not targeting these men because they are famous but because complaints have been made against them.’

Pete Saunders, of the National 
Association of People Abused in Childhood, added: ‘I’d like to meet with
Eddy, and to have him explain to me, and maybe explain to some rape 
victims, what he means by “raped raped”, because my understanding is 
there is rape, or there is not rape, and rape is always a crime.’
