She's married to a footballer and is preparing to slip into a wedding dress this year, so a healthy fitness regime is, perhaps unsurprisingly, high on Christine Bleakley's priority list.

And now, the TV presenter has revealed how she stays in shape and has shared her top fitness tips for busy women who want to keep active.

The svelte 35-year-old, who is the perfect advert for a healthy lifestyle, said: 'Fitness and keeping fit is very important to me and it’s very much a part of my life but with family life I know that finding the time in the week to exercise can be difficult. But there are lots of ways that you can combine the two and get you and your family active and healthy.'

Now we can all look like her! Christine Bleakley, who turned PE teacher for the day to help children prepare for the Sainsbury's anniversary games this Sunday, shared her favourite ways of getting fit

Christine, who is the ambassador for Sainsbury’s Anniversary Games, suggests raiding your children's sports bag and seeing what 'goodies' are in there.

'You may not have picked up a skipping rope since you were 10 years old but just a few minutes a day is great cardio exercise and doesn’t require a gym membership. Get your kids involved and see who can do the most skips in a minute,' she advises.

Christine also revealed that one of her favourite ways to stay in shape is by hula hooping. 'I was playing with them (Frank's daughters) recently and it was amazing how out of breath I got,' she added.

Christine, who acts as a stepmother to Frank Lampard's young daughters with Elen Rivas, said: 'Sometimes you feel like you have to make a choice between spending time with the family and working out but this doesn’t always have to be the case.

Football fans: Speaking about her favourite sports, Christine, who is set to tie the knot with Chelsea and England star Frank Lampard this year, said that obviously they love watching football but she's a fan of all sports

'Why not combine the two and head down to your local park with the family. It’s a great place to be for a run around in the fresh air, get a group together and have a game of rounders – fun for kids and adults alike. Watch out, in my experience the adults always get competitive!'

She believes that just five minutes a day can help to whip you into shape revealing that her 'intensive workout' is a mini circuit challenge, which consists of one minute plank, one minute of squats, one minute of sit-ups, one minute of press ups and one minute of burpees.

'It doesn’t sound a lot but I can guarantee you’ll feel like you’ve had a work out once you’ve finished and if you do it every day you’ll see real differences.

'The beauty of these exercises is that they all rely on body weight alone and don’t require any equipment, and even better, you can easily do them in your living room or back garden,' she said.

Speaking about her favourite sports, Christine, who is set to tie the knot with Chelsea and England star Frank Lampard this year, said: 'Obviously in our household we love watching football but I’m a fan of all sports and sporting events are a great way to get the family together and inspire kids to enjoy sport and be active from an early age.

'I always find exercise so much easier when I have a friend to do it with me. Team up with some of the other mums you know and enter a local sporting challenge like a 5k run, cycle ride or swimathon. Having a goal to train for keeps you so much more motivated and on track.

'Plus committing to regular training sessions with friends will ensure you don’t let your training slip. If you have older kids - get them involved in your training too.'

Fitness fan: Christine may find it hard to fit an exercise regime into her working day soon as she prepares to fill in for Holly Willoughby on some of her shows whilst she's on maternity leave

And it isn't just her fitness regime that Christine takes seriously, adding: 'Let’s not forget healthy eating, which will really complement your fitness drive. I find that doing a weekly shop means that I plan ahead and there is always healthy food in the house.

'I love cooking and always try to make nutritious meals that the whole family will enjoy. Simple things like replacing the middle layer of pasta in a lasagne with courgettes make the family favourite that bit more nutritious.'

Christine may find it hard to fit an exercise regime into her working day soon as she prepares to fill in for Holly Willoughby on some of her shows while she's on maternity leave.

While Amanda Holden was announced as the official replacement for Holly, Christine will also present some of the shows missed by Holly while she is on leave.
