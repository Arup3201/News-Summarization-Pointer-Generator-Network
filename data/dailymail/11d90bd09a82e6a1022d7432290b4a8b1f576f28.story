Dick Clark, the legendary TV host who brought American Bandstand and his trademark New Year’s countdown to living rooms for decades, has died.

The career entertainer was 82 years old.

Spokesman Paul Shefrin said Clark suffered a massive heart attack this morning at Saint John's hospital in Santa Monica, a day after he was admitted for an outpatient procedure.

Clark had continued performing even after he suffered a stroke in 2004 that affected his ability to speak and walk.

He thrived as the founder of Dick Clark Productions, supplying movies, game and music shows, beauty contests and more to TV.

As news of his death spread, a number of TV, screen and stage stars took to Twitter to express their sorrow.

Among them was Ryan Seacrest, who has named Clark as a huge influence on his own career.

Seacrest said: 'I am deeply saddened by the loss of my dear friend Dick Clark. He has truly been one of the greatest influences in my life'.

Not everyone was so reverential. Comedian and actor Dennis Leary referred to Clark as one of the last 'leather faced syrup voiced lizard people.'

Among his credits: The $25,000 Pyramid,TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes and the American Music Awards.

For a time in the 1980s, he had shows on all three networks and was listed among the Forbes 400 of wealthiest Americans.

Clark also was part of radio as partner in the United Stations Radio Network, which provided programs - including Clark's - to thousands of stations.

'There's hardly any segment of the population that doesn't see what I do,' Clark told The Associated Press in a 1985 interview.

'It can be embarrassing. People come up to me and say, `I love your show,' and I have no idea which one they're talking about'.

He was dubbed ‘America’s oldest teenager’ because of his fresh-faced appearance that was seemingly unchanged for years.

But the stroke in December 2004 changed that, severely damaging Clark's mobility and leaving him unable to appear on the New Year’s Eve telecast that year.

When he returned to Dick Clark's New Year’s Rockin' Eve in 2005, he appeared noticeably gaunt and frail.

He was born Richard Wagstaff Clark in Mount Vernon, N.Y., in 1929.

His father, Richard Augustus Clark, was a sales manager who worked in radio.

Clark idolized his athletic older brother, Bradley, who was killed in World War II.

He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 1994 and served as spokesman for the American Association of Diabetes Educators.

Clark, twice divorced, had a son, 
Richard Augustus II, with first wife Barbara Mallery and two children, 
Duane and Cindy, with second wife Loretta Martin. He married Kari Wigton
in 1977.

TV and radio host Ryan Seacrest: 'I am deeply saddened by the loss of my dear friend Dick Clark. He has truly been one of the greatest influences in my life.'

CNN newsman Anderson Cooper: 'What a career Dick Clark had! What a life! My thoughts are with his family and friends.'

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg: 'Dick Clark's spirit will always live on in Times Square & the hearts of millions of New Yorkers'

Late night host Jimmy Kimmel: 'I had the pleasure of working with Dick Clark many times - great guy. Some trivia: did you know he HATED music?'

Comedienne Joan Rivers: 'Very sad to hear about Dick Clark. What a great life. What a great career. Relevant until the end. He will be missed!'

Singer Fergie: 'Dick Clark will be truly missed. We will carry on his legacy every New Year's Eve'

Dancing With the Stars host Tom Bergeron: 'RIP Dick Clark. A consummate broadcaster.'

How I Met Your Mother star Neil Patrick Harris: 'For ever, Dick Clark... So long.'

Larry King: 'Dick Clark was a great friend, true legend, & a master journalist. Nobody did what he did better. It was a pleasure to be in his company.'

Will and Grace star Sean Hayes: 'R.I.P. Dick Clark. Thanks for bringing music into our homes via TV and #AmericanBandstand.'

Jermaine Jackson: 'Dick Clark always came to our dressing pre-show to make sure we were okay and catered for. Big hearted. One-of-a-kind. Will be missed...'

Rapper and actor ICE T: 'I'm old enough to remember watching James Brown on American Bandstand.. Dick Clark was the man! RestInPeace'

In his 1976 autobiography, Rock, Roll 
& Remember, Clark recalled how radio helped ease his loneliness and 
turned him into a fan of Steve Allen, Arthur Godfrey and other popular 
hosts.

From Godfrey, he said, he learned that 
'a radio announcer does not talk to "those of you out there in radio 
land"; a radio announcer talks to me as an individual'.

Clark began his career in the mailroom of a Utica, N.Y., radio station in 1945.

By
age 26, he was a broadcasting veteran, with nine years' experience on 
radio and TV stations in Syracuse and Utica, N.Y., and Philadelphia.

He held a bachelor's degree from Syracuse University.

While in Philadelphia, Clark befriended 
McMahon, who later credited Clark for introducing him to his future 
Tonight Show boss, Johnny Carson.

The original American Bandstand was one of network TV's longest-running series as part of ABC's daytime line-up from 1957 to 1987.

Clark joined 'Bandstand' in 1956 after Bob Horn, who'd been the host since its 1952 debut, was fired. Under Clark's guidance, it went from a local Philadelphia show to a national phenomenon.

'I played records, the kids danced, and America watched,' was how Clark once described the series' simplicity. In his 1958 hit 'Sweet Little Sixteen,' Chuck Berry sang that 'they'll be rocking on Bandstand, Philadelphia, P-A'.

As a host, he had the smooth delivery of a seasoned radio announcer. As a producer, he had an ear for a hit record.

He also knew how to make wary adults welcome this odd new breed of music in their homes.

Clark
endured accusations that he was in with the squares, with critic Lester
Bangs defining Bandstand as 'a leggily acceptable euphemism of the 
teenage experience'.

In a 
1985 interview, Clark acknowledged the complaints. 'But I knew at the 
time that if we didn't make the presentation to the older generation 
palatable, it could kill it'.

'So
along with Little Richard and Chuck Berry and the Platters and the 
Crows and the Jayhawks ... the boys wore coats and ties and the girls 
combed their hair and they all looked like sweet little kids into a high
school dance,' he said.

But Clark defended pop artists and 
artistic freedom, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said in an online 
biography of the 1993 inductee.

He helped give black artists their due by playing original R&B recordings instead of cover versions by white performers, and he condemned censorship.

Over the years, it introduced stars ranging from Buddy Holly to Michael Jackson to Bon Jovi to Madonna.

In 2004, Clark announced plans for a 
revamped version of American Bandstand. The show, produced with American
Idol creator Simon Fuller, was to feature a host other than Clark.
