A 71-year-old man is in custody after a suspicious package was discovered in the U.S. departures area at Montreal's Trudeau airport.

The U.S. screening area was closed and a number of American bound flights delayed after the package was found inside a suitcase at the airport's terminal early Sunday morning.

Authorities surrounded five blocks in the nearby residential suburb of LaSalle and evacuated dozens of homes as they searched for the suspect.

One residence was searched and a bomb disposal robot was brought in while the suspect's vehicle was also searched, according to CTV News.

At least a dozen emergency vehicles were on the scene.

Police spokesman Jean-Pierre Brabant said about 20 people were ordered from their homes in the neighborhood as a precaution.

Airport screening officers reported a suspicious item in a passenger's carry-on bag at around 5:40 a.m. and called Montreal Police who took over the investigation.

Police insist the bag did not contain an explosive, but Brabant said the suitcase was taken away to be analyzed.

The incident delayed 16 flights and shut down the security screening area at the U.S. departure zone for three hours. The package was discovered at a security checkpoint and the passenger was booked on a U.S.-bound flight.

An airport spokeswoman said flight operations had since resumed.

Police are looking at surveillance tapes from the airport as part of their investigation.

The suspect hasn't been named and it's not clear if they have been arrested.
