One of the great mysteries shrouding the origins of life on Earth is how complex organisms began to take shape.

Theory should hold that ‘short’ fragments of genetic material would have reproduced in abundance, leaving longer strands - and thus complex life - behind.

But new research has revealed that longer strands may have thrived in volcanic 'pores' on the young Earth - ultimately allowing life to evolve to the complexity we see today.

Researchers from Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich have attempted to solve one of the paradoxes of the origins of life. They say that complex life could have gained a foothold in hydrothermal vents (stock image shown) in the early Earth, billions of years ago

The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature.

They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began.

In October 2014 researchers from UC Santa Barbara found an unusual glimpse of the beginning of Earth deep in a Samoan volcano.

Known as hotspots, volcanic island chains such as Samoa can have ancient primordial signatures from the early solar system that have somehow survived billions of years.

Researchers now say they have found unique chemical signatures that show them what conditions were like.

The geochemists said they found evidence of Earth's early formation still trapped inside the volcanic hotspots.

One crucial precondition for the origin of life is that comparatively simple biomolecules must have had opportunities to form more complex structures.

These, in turn, had to be capable of reproducing themselves, storing genetic information in a chemically stable form.

Creating longer strands of RNA to store this genetic information would have been essential - but it simply wouldn’t have been possible in most conditions on Earth.

But LMU physicists led by Dr Dieter Braun now describe a setting which provides the necessary conditions.

They showed experimentally that pore systems on the seafloor that were heated by volcanic activity, namely hydrothermal vents, could have served as reaction chambers for this RNA.

The research was carried out by a team from the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet (LMU) in Munich and published in the journal Nature. They found that water-filled micropores in hot rocks - from volcanic activity (stock image shown) - may have acted as the nurseries in which life on Earth began 

No one is quite sure how complex genetic material came to be. In theory, 'short' strands of RNA (illustrated) should have thrived in the early Earth - at the expense of longer strands. This new theory, though, provides a possible explanation for how we ultimately evolved on the planet

To do this they used tiny glass capillary tubes to simulate the pores found in rocks. Heating the tubes showed that longer strands of RNA became trapped in the pore.

‘The key requirement is that the heat source be localised on one side of the elongated pore, so that the water on that side is significantly warmer than that on the other,’ said Dr Braun.

Biomolecules that were washed into the pore could then be trapped, and concentrated, by the high temperature - forming longer polymers.

This was important for the evolution of RNA and DNA, as it enabled more genetic information to be stored in longer molecules.

Thus, the LMU group has succeeded in constructing a system which permits autonomous and continuous Darwinian evolution of ever more complex biomolecules - defining realistic conditions under which life could in principle have evolved.

'Life is fundamentally a thermodynamic non-equilibrium phenomenon. That is why the emergence of the first life-forms requires a local imbalance driven by an external energy source - for example, by a temperature difference imposed from outside the system,' Dr Braun explained.

'That this can be achieved in such a simple and elegant way was surprising even to us. The success of the project is a tribute to the close cooperation between all members of the team.'
