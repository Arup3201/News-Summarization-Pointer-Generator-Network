A 16-month-old boy died after swallowing iron tablets he thought were his 'mummy’s sweets', an inquest heard.

Corbin Littlewood, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, took a fatal dose after being given the pills by his toddler sister, who had climbed onto a bathroom sink to reach them from a shelf.

When Corbin was taken to hospital after he swallowed the tablets on March 21 doctors also found he was suffering from swine flu.

Loss: Corbin Littlewood died after swallowing iron tablets he thought were sweets

He died from a combination of the overdose and swine flu three days later.

The inquest in Huddersfield on Wednesday heard how Corbin’s mother, Claire Hockham, had stored the tablets - which she had been given just days earlier to treat her anaemia - on a bathroom shelf out of reach of her three children.

But Corbin’s older sister climbed onto the bathroom sink and opened the child-proof bottle before giving him what she called 'mummy's sweets'. They then each took several pills.

Doctors discovered that Corbin had extremely dangerous levels of iron in his blood, an overdose of which often causes fatal damage to vital organs

The youngsters were taken to Calderdale Royal Hospital after Miss Hockham found Corbin vomiting and called an ambulance.

Doctors discovered that Corbin had extremely dangerous levels of iron in his blood, an overdose of which often causes fatal damage to vital organs, the inquest heard.

He was also found to be suffering from the deadly H1N1 variant of influenza known as swine flu and was transferred to the intensive paediatric care unit at Leeds General Infirmary, where he was given anti-viral drug Tamiflu.

He was put on drugs which increase the heart’s muscular power to stabilise his soaring blood pressure and help his breathing.

But doctors told Miss Hockham and the boy's father Gary Littlewood, who were expecting their fourth child, to prepare for the worst and Corbin died on March 24.

Corbin’s sister did not have enough of the iron in her system to cause damage and made a full recovery.

The inquest concluded that Corbin had died from bronchopneumonia and lung damage caused by iron poisoning and H1N1 flu.

Detective Sergeant Stephen Barnes, of 
West Yorkshire Police, told the coroner that the iron tablets could 
easily be mistaken for sweets, especially by children.

He
 said: 'Medication for children is normally in syrup form, so although 
they wouldn’t understand what a tablet could do they have plenty of 
experience of sweets.

'Iron tablets in particular look exactly like sweets.'

Coroner Mary Burke said it was impossible to tell whether Corbin had died from the overdose, swine flu or both.

Iron tablets are dietary supplements containing iron and are primarily used to treat anaemia or other iron deficiencies.

Anaemia is a decrease in the number of red blood cells or less than the normal quantity of haemoglobin in the blood.

A 2012 study found taking supplements for 12 weeks reduced fatigue by almost a half in women who had low iron levels.

American doctors say iron overdose has been one of the leading causes of death caused by toxicological agents in children younger than six because they look like sweets.

Side effects can include diarrhea or constipation and abdominal discomfort.

Recording a narrative verdict, she said: 'The daughter was not of an age to comprehend what her actions could have resulted in. Corbin himself was too young to understand what these tablets were.

'Both regarded their mother’s medication as sweets... and tragically it resulted in Corbin’s untimely death.

'This is a tragic, tragic set of circumstances. I am fully satisfied that Corbin’s parents acted responsibly with regards to Ms Hockham’s medication and took all reasonable measures to ensure the safe placing of it.'

She added: 'The combination of the iron poisoning and the swine flu resulted in Corbin’s death.

'He consumed a large number of tablets, tests revealed he had very high iron levels. He had also contracted swine flu.

'I wish his parents the very deepest condolences. The loss of such a young child is undoubtedly very tragic indeed.'

Corbin’s parents did not attend the inquest, but Miss Hockham, 24, said afterwards: 'He was the happiest, bubbliest and cheekiest little boy.

'To lose a child is unimaginable.'
