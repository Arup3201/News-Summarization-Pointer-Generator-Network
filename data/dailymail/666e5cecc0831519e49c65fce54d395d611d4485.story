Proving a point: The former Westlife singer, pictured here with wife Vogue, cancelled his Ryanair flight after the airline requested a fee for printing off a boarding pass

Former Westlife star Brian McFadden has called the chief executive of Ryanair a 'scumbag' in an angry Twitter rant after the airline tried to charge him an extra £150 to fly when he arrived at Liverpool Airport.

The Irish pop singer was told by check-in staff that he would need to fork out an extra £70 to
print his boarding pass and £80 for going four kilograms
over the carrier's baggage weight limit.

Outraged McFadden quickly shared his disgust over the charges with his Twitter followers - calling chief executive of the airline, Michael O'Leary, a 'scumbag who exploits hard working people'.

He tweeted: 'had so much i wanted to say about my ryanair experience 
today but ill keep it simple. MICHAEL O LEARY (sic) you're a scumbag who
exploits....hard working people and tricks them out of their money with your ridiculous loop holes.'

McFadden
then berated the Irish airline, which was running at a loss until it brought in Michael O'Leary - one of Ireland's richest businessmen - to change its fortunes in 1991, for 'stealing from your own people!'

The musician, who'd been performing a DJ set in Liverpool, then turned on his 
heel when told he would have to pay the charges if he wanted to board the flight.

He instead chose to take a train to London where he could catch another flight to Spain to play golf.

He admitted changing his 
plans 'cost more in the end but its (sic) the principle of it'.

Low-cost airline Ryanair has issued a sarcastic riposte to the singer's comments.

After reading McFadden's angry four-tweet rant, airline spokesman Robin Kiely told MailOnline: 'We’re
surprised that Mr McFadden, having agreed to print his boarding card, couldn’t
manage this super-complex task, which is accomplished daily by over 80million
passengers annually.'

The company's notoriously outspoken chief executive Michael O'Leary has previously branded those who object to paying a penalty for failing to print their own boarding cards as ‘idiots’ who should ‘b***** off’.

The outspoken chief executive of the budget airline said passengers who arrive for flights without a pass are ‘stupid’ and it is right they are charged £60 a time to have one printed at the check-in desk because it is their ‘**** up’.

'Loopholes': Former Westlife star Brian McFadden was told by Ryanair he would have to pay a total of £150 on top of the cost of his flight to print a boarding pass and for extra luggage allowance

His 
remarks were made in September last year after passenger Suzy McLeod was
forced to pay £236 to print boarding passes for herself, her parents, 
and her two children so they could fly home to Britain from Alicante, 
Spain.

McFadden's followers soon shared their similar experiences of having to pay extra charges.

One, Helen Lord, said: 'we 
fly with them next week, cost more for my 5 month old daughter who has 
no seat, than an adult fare #gofigure".'

Another, Rebecca Jones, waded in
with: 'I've just come back from alicante on Ryanair...nightmare!!!!
I won't be flying with them again anytime soon!!!'
