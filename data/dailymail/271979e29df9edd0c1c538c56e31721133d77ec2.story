Court victory: Philip Marshall and his family spent four days trying to make it home from Madrid

When volcanic ash closed Europe’s skies two years ago, Philip Marshall and his family were stranded halfway home from a holiday of a lifetime in South America.

But unlike thousands facing similar nightmares, Mr Marshall just happens to be one of Britain’s top barristers specialising in commercial litigation.

The QC has since won £10,000 from the airline forced to cancel his family’s flight.

He and his wife and three children had enjoyed a fortnight in Ecuador and a visit to the Galapagos Islands.

They
had flown back to Madrid, where they were due to board a flight home to
London, when all flights were cancelled as volcano Eyjafjallajökull 
erupted in Iceland.

At the airport, Mr Marshall, 46, and his
wife Barbara, 47, were told by an Iberia Airlines worker that they were
best off arranging their own way back to London.

Holiday nightmares: The Marshall family were stranded in Madrid when ash from Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano grounded planes and closed airports across Europe in April 2010

In fact, a flight became available the next day. But by then the unwitting Marshalls had begun their own exhausting four-day trip home.

They hired a car and drove to Bordeaux, where they spent a night, before driving to Paris.

The next day they caught a train to Brussels, where they also overnighted, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

Bad advice: The Marshalls (not pictured) were trapped like so many travellers across Europe, but were wrongly told by their airline to make their own way home. A judge said Iberia failed to re-route them as soon as possible

The EU ‘Denied Boarding and Cancellation Regulations’ entitle passengers caught up in the ash chaos in April 2010 to refunds or alternative flights.

Iberia Airlines refunded in full the £1,075 cost of the Marshalls’ cancelled flights to London, but refused to refund them the costs of their alternative journey home.

                     Judge William Birtles

Mr Marshall represented himself as  he fought the Spanish airline through the courts to win back the cash  spent on his family’s overland odyssey across Europe.

At the City of London County Court  a district judge dismissed his claim  on the grounds that, under the  EU rules, airlines do not have to  compensate passengers in ‘extraordinary circumstances’.

But Mr Marshall appealed and the judgment was overturned at the same court by Judge William Birtles, who said the airline had breached its  contract and air industry regulations  in failing to re-route the family as soon as possible.

Iberia Airlines was ordered to pay about
£8,000 for the Marshalls’ cost of getting home, plus £2,000 damages for
inconvenience. The airline then tried to challenge this at the Court of
Appeal, without success.

This week Lord Justice Aikens said of 
the amount awarded: ‘That may be a significant sum for Mr and Mrs 
Marshall, I do not know. I am certain it is absolutely insignificant to 
Iberia Airlines.’

Out of pocket: Passengers face disruption at Manchester airport. More than 150,000 Britons were stranded overseas, but most did not get compensation because the eruption was deemed 'extraordinary circumstances'

Yesterday Mr Marshall said: ‘It was 
quite clear to me these airlines want to intimidate people into not 
making a claim.

There have been conflicting decisions in the county 
courts in previous cases as to whether or not you can claim 
compensation.

I hope my case will assist others in showing you do have a
right to seek compensation.’ He estimated the airline had spent ‘easily
£50,000’ contesting the case, which he described as ‘crazy’.
