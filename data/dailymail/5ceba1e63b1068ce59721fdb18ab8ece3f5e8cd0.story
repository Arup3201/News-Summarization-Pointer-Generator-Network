There are certain traditions over Christmas and New Year that are inevitable - and the trip to the pantomime often tops the list.

But for some of us who have been to our fair share of festive plays 'she's behind you' can start to sound like a broken record.

So rather than suffer another year of bad jokes and questionable celebrity guests FEMAIL has done the legwork and found the best alternative shows.

From those  after a naughtier serving of  entertainment to parents looking for a show suitable for all the family, we have got an option for everyone.

Sleeping Booty sees the traditional fairy tale take on a very adult, double entendre-packed persona

FOR THE GROWN-UP PANTO-GOER: SLEEPING BOOTY

Rating:

Verdict: Completely offensive but an absolute hoot

Vulgar, smutty and crude are just some of the words that could describe Sleeping Booty, an adult take on the classic fairy tale but, honestly, that's the appeal.

The UK's number one adult pantomime production responsible for DICK! returns this year with its somewhat obscene version of Sleeping Beauty. 

The somewhat obscene production stars one of Soho's most infamous drag queens Miss Dusty O

The demure sleeping beauty that you are familiar with takes on a gangster persona in this story. 

The ladette and stripper Booty, desperate to rid herself of her purity enlists the help of Fairy Muff in the quest to find the perfect man to...do the job.

But despite her best efforts the determined fairy can only conjure up the sexually ambiguous Prince Willie Wontie complete with silver knee high boots. 

Booty soon realises she will have to look elsewhere, so the story follows one princess's quest to pop her cherry while dodging the threats from the infamous drag queen Miss Dusty O who is at her best as the foul mouthed Mangelina wreaking havoc across the perverted panto land.

The production follows the story of a young stripper on a quest to lose her innocence with hilarious results

The storyline may not be the strongest to have graced the West End but you are sure not to notice as the side-splitting humour that comes with it is enough of a distraction.

The small venue creates  a cosy atmosphere so makes the perfect arena for audience participation - of which there is plenty -  for those of us who are still kids at heart.

The themes may be tawdry but the performers are all talent and will honestly leave you in the best of moods. Who knew that a bad taste joke was the key to that  festive feeling?

Sleeping Booty! runs at the Leicester Square theatre until 17 January. Ticket price £22.

WARNING: Sleeping Booty is strictly an over-18s show  

Matthew Bourne recreates Tim Burton's classic tale of Edward Scissorhands in a charming new ballet 

FOR AN ENCHANTING EVENING: EDWARD SCISSORHANDS THE BALLET

Rating:

Verdict: Tentative and thoughtful 

The ballet is one our most genteel Christmas traditions filled with Sugar Plum fairies and mouse kings.

But the dance production of the Tim Burton classic Edward Scissorhands is a far cry from the Nutcracker.

Matthew Bourne first wowed audiences with his production of Swan Lake 20 years ago when he ruffled feathers with his troupe of all male bare-chested swans.

Fans of the film will notice the few changes to the storyline, particularly the ending in the ballet adaptation

It has since seen him reinvent classic ballets including Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella and Nutcracker.

But for his latest work Bourne has chosen the ultimate Gothic fairy tale and the film that cemented director Tim Burton’s career in 1990, as well as those of its young stars Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.

The Scissorhands character, the clunky sharp-fingered Edward's awkward movements and clumsy manner are incorporated into a glorious and inventive sequence.

The tender nature of Edward Scissorhand's character complements the style of dance exquisitely 

Those who are familiar with the film will know that Edward isn't much of a talker and this marries perfectly with speechless ballet capturing his tender and curious characteristics perfectly.

There is no shortage of stage magic with Edward's knack for hairdressing and topiary recreated entirely seamlessly and convincingly. 

Fans of the Tim Burton classic will notice some changes to the story with much of the brutal final scene altered and made more ballet-friendly.

The quirky Burton sensibility remains, however, and the set and costumes are perhaps some of the most familiar aspects of  the production with the candy-coloured houses and all-American costumes instantly recognisable.

Despite its sombre themes, the production is charming and is sure to leave you feeling surprisingly Christmassy.

Edward Scissorhands is showing at Sadler's Wells Theatre in London until 11 January. Ticket price from £27. 

Slava's Snowshow follows the story of a clown caught in a snowstorm in a mesmerising production

FOR THE KID IN YOU: SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW

Rating:

Verdict: Breathtaking and endless fun

If there is one aspect of a panto that is always unavoidable, it is the grumpy dad. 

Uncooperative, refusing to engage in any sort of audience participation and murmuring 'oh no you didn't' as quietly as possible, it is well known that most dads do not share a passion for panto.

So it really must be a testament to Slava's Snowshow that not only is there a sea of smiling men in the audience but a flurry of fathers who are actually WILLING to join in.

The show relies mainly on mime  while the fantastical set and effects provides the main point of interest

The audience unravels giant spider webs (pictured) and gets caught in a spectacular snow storm

Celebrating the 20th anniversary of its UK debut in 1994, the multi award-winning production follows the tale of Assissiai the clown as he gets caught up in a spectacular snow storm that engulfs the whole stage.

The style of the show is similar to that of Cirque du Soleil in its theatrical quality with the colours, set and music taking on an inventive and wacky charm.

The storyline is loose and sometimes hard to follow with the cast of clowns relying mainly on mime to communicate the tale, however this is neither here nor there as the conjuring of a paper snow storm on stage is what you really come to see.

The show which is celebrating the 20th anniversary of its UK debut is designed to appeal to your inner child 

The performance is in no way confined to the stage and the audience becomes blasted by a blizzard and giant balloons pass through the crowd.

The producers behind the show wanted to create an immersive experience that transports their viewers back to their childhood and the show does exactly that.

The textures and colours of the inventive mise-en-scene are so tempting to both older and younger viewers that even the grumpiest of dads are transported back to a younger and more innocent time that is all about having fun and being silly.

Slava's Snowshow is showing at  London's Southbank Centre until 5 January. Ticket price £20-£65. Premium tickets are also available.

Recommended for children five years and over and strictly no children under three will be permitted.
