A substance-abuse counselor who struck a pedestrian with her car and drove through a Los Angeles suburb with the dying man on her windshield has been sentenced to 55 years to life in prison.

Sherri Lynn Wilkins, 53, wept as she was sentenced on Thursday after being convicted of second-degree murder, drunken driving and hit-and-run.

Wilkins' blood-alcohol level was nearly twice the legal limit when she struck 31-year-old Phillip Moreno in 2012.

Sherri Lynn Wilkins became emotional in court during sentencing today in Los Angeles. Wilkins, a substance abuse counselor, who struck a pedestrian with her car and drove through a LA suburb with the dying man on her windshield was sentenced to 55 years to life in prison

She drove two miles before other motorists were able to swarm her car at a traffic light and keep her there until police arrived.

Wilkins, who was an addict before she became a drug and alcohol counselor, said she had been drinking that night but wasn't drunk.

She was leaving a counseling center when she hit Moreno.

Wilkins, 52, who was an addict before she became a drug and alcohol counselor, said she had been drinking that night but wasn't drunk.

She said she had been 'self-medicating' while waiting for knee-replacement surgery and had consumed three airplane-size bottles of vodka and a can of Budweiser beer and Clamato before starting to drive.

Deputy District Attorney John Harlan told jurors that after Wilkins hit Moreno, she 'drove him closer to his death'.

Harlan said the force of the crash punched a hole in the passenger side of Wilkins' window and Moreno lost his shoes and pants, but still she didn't stop to render aid or call 911.

Full force: Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield in 2012

Wilkins will serve 55 years to life in prison after she struck and killed 31-year-old Phillip Moreno in 2012

It wasn't until passing motorists 
noticed the bizarre scene that they were able to swarm Wilkins' car at a
 traffic light and keep her there until police arrived.

31-year-old Phillip Moreno was pronounced dead at the hospital in 2012

Police said Moreno was still able to speak to them when he was pulled from the car windshield but later died in hospital.

Wilkins testified during the trial, telling jurors the story of her addiction, 
which began when she was in a car accident at the age of 15 and suffered
 a broken back and shattered bones in her ankles and legs.

Wilkins said 
she started using heroin when it became 'cheaper than going to the 
doctor'.

Wilkins, who 
acknowledged having served time for residential burglaries over the 
years, said she kicked the heroin habit with the help of methadone and 
more recently had been using medical marijuana. She told of obtaining a 
degree in addiction counselling and going to work at a treatment center.

Wilkins was leaving the center on the night of the crash.

She
 told the court Mr Moreno seemed to fly onto her car in the 2012 
incident in Torrance, but the events remained a surreal blur. Prosecutors say Mr Moreno was struck so hard that he flipped onto Wilkins' car and punched a hole in the windshield.

‘It was a flash, ‘Wilkins said. ‘I pretty much felt him landing on my window. To me, it felt like he came from the sky.’

Asked
 by her attorney, Nan Whitfield, how she felt in that moment, she said, ‘Very confused, 
like it wasn't real. It took me a while to figure out there was a body 
on the windshield.’

‘I didn't feel like I had hit him with my car,’ she said. ‘I felt like he fell into my windshield from up high.’

Wilkins
 said she panicked and kept driving until other motorists told her to 
pull over. ‘I was very scared,’ she said. ‘I kind of froze.'

Wilkins was sentenced to 55 years to life after she failed to stop after hitting a pedestrian and drove with him stuck into her windshield for two miles

‘Were you happy in November of 2012?’ asked Whitfield. ‘For the first time I was,’ she whispered and began to cry.

Superior
 Court Judge Henry Hall cut off further exploration of her personal 
history. Wilkins is being brought to the courtroom in a wheelchair.

On cross-examination, Deputy District 
Attorney John Harlan asked if Wilkins thought that night she should call
 her husband to pick her up since she had been drinking.

‘No,’ she said. ‘I wasn't drunk.’

Asked what she was thinking, Wilkins said, ‘I was thinking I'd better hurry up and get home before the effects hit me.’

Asked
 about her lack of response afterward, she said, ‘I was freaking out. It
 was not like I knew what  was happening ... I still can't believe what 
happened.’
