When they step into the Miami heat, England’s players will want to rip off those training tops. Here in Florida, it was 29 degrees by midday on Sunday. And the humidity, which was 73 per cent, will make a 90-minute training session exhausting.

Sit in the sun for more than five minutes in Miami and sweat marks begin to appear all over your T-shirt.

On Monday, when England begin preparations for Wednesday’s friendly with Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium, they will train in slow-motion. There is no alternative.

All aboard: The England squad have flown to Miami to continue their World Cup preparations

Hot, hot, hot: Temperatures in Miami have been reaching 29 degrees by midday this week

England are here to replicate the conditions in Manaus, Brazil, where Roy Hodgson’s side will play their opening group game against Italy on June 14.

No-one in their right mind will come out all guns blazing in these conditions. A patient, technical approach is the only viable tactic.

When England trained for a week in Portugal, players wore bobble hats, gloves and winter tights to help them prepare for the challenge.

Say cheese: England players posed in their suits for the World Cup team photo before flying out to Miami
