England have a simple decision to make on Saturday: run out in Rome with the grand ambition of winning the championship, or tediously settle for winning the game and seeing what happens.

The Six Nations is about three things: winning the Grand Slam, winning the championship and - most importantly - World Cup preparation.

England are in the toughest World Cup pool in history with Australia and Wales next year, and although England will back themselves at Twickenham, there is a real possibility that these three teams will beat one another and winning the pool - or even coming second - could boil down to points difference.

Go for it: England have a tough decision to make on Saturday, settle for winning or try and hammer Italy

That means this is the perfect dress rehearsal for the scenario in which England need to dramatically boost their points difference. It could be the difference between facing South Africa in the quarter-finals or Samoa - or not making the knockout stages at all.

As well as Wales and Australia at the World Cup, England are likely to face Fiji and a team such as Georgia. England should manage a cricket score against Georgia, but Fiji at full strength are every bit as good as Italy - and that is the fixture which England should have in the back of their minds today.

This season, both Manchester City and Arsenal came second in their Champions League groups on goal difference and consequently found themselves facing - and going out to - Bayern Munich and Barcelona. 

There is no silver lining in losing on points difference and the England team should view coming second as failure. We’re surely setting our sights too low if we are celebrating beating Scotland, Ireland and Wales.

You cannot replicate the intensity of the Wales week in the build-up to facing Italy because there is no chance of defeat so you have to create that edge by demanding your players belt Italy.

Big game? England won't be able to replicate the intensity of the victory over Wales last week

TWO LINES OF ATTACK

England now have the confidence and the personnel to attack with two running lines at once, which forces defenders to hesitate before committing to a tackle.

Owen Farrell can read a defence and either pass a flat ball to a direct runner such as Luther Burrell (option 1) or throw the ball deep behind to Billy Twelvetrees (option 2), who can himself read the open field and choose to attack himself, pass inside or release Mike Brown out wide.

The flexibility and versatility of attacking like this makes England’s dynamic back three even more dangerous. Brown has made the most metres (410), most clean breaks (7) and beaten most defenders (20). England must get him the ball in space.

NEW BALL GAME

Attention to detail is key to being clinical and I’m pleased that England ensured the adidas match ball was sent over from Italy for training. Its panelling is different to the Gilbert ball that the players are used to handling, so it can feel different to the fingers and fly differently off the boot.

With the need to rack up a huge score, it is very important Farrell has been using it for kicking practice this week.

The new challenge, and the way to get the players pumped up, is to put the competition’s minnows to the sword. This is not demanding the undoable - England score on average 39 points and 4.6 tries per game against Italy - but it is time to smash them again.

Last year England failed to score a try against Italy at Twickenham, while on our last three visits to Rome, England failed to win by more than five points. That is unacceptable.

The mindset must be to score as many points as you possibly can because imagine the nervousness in the Irish dressing room if they know they suddenly have to beat France by more than 15 points.

My ambition would be to score eight tries.

I would make it clear to the team that unless England have scored four tries by half-time, I’m taking you off and I am changing the back line. Danny Care, Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell would all come off and I would start the second half with Lee Dickson and George Ford as my half-backs, and Farrell shifting to inside centre alongside Manu Tuilagi. What a fantastic back division to bring on and a totally different midfield axis.

Impact: I would bring on Lee Dickson (left) and George Ford at half-time, depending on the score

Star sub: And Tuilagi could change the game if he replaces Luther Burrell

I would have called a team meeting on Monday morning to set the agenda for the week. You warn the players that as soon as you feel the performance is slipping, you are bringing your substitutes on.

In fact, I would even consider making the target three tries by the half-hour mark and warn my players that they will not even see out the first half unless they deliver.

Would I share this with the media? Why not. This is a week to play with people’s minds and really put them under pressure and see how they respond. You generate intensity by raising expectation, not talking down England’s chances. Do not accept this is another game.

You need possession to score points so a key requirement is to keep the ball in play as much as possible. The ambition must be never to kick the ball away.

Ireland had possession against Italy for 26min 45sec so I want to see England smash that record by 20 per cent (England’s best so far is 22min 56sec in their opening match in Paris)

Rallying call: I would have called a team meeting, to let them know if standards slip, subs will come on

Big boot: Farrell must try to keep the ball in play, and not allow stoppages

Second of all, you need to ensure the referee allows the game to be played to your tempo. You make sure captain Chris Robshaw is in his ear all game, making sure he stops the clock immediately if someone is injured so no seconds are wasted.

If you win a penalty, kick to the corner quickly and Courtney Lawes should pre-call the line-out while the pack are running to take it. Drop goals are worth taking if the ball is slow and the defence is set, but make the decision quickly and start again.

Saturday is the day to really show off England’s new all-court game. England have developed a pack of forwards who love to handle the ball so they would relish this challenge.

Quality delivery at the breakdown is key, so players must commit in number to sort the mess out and give the backs slick, quick ball.

Game changers: It's time for England's forwards to show off their new quick game, especially Courtney Lawes

Crunch clash: Can Chris Robshaw lead this team to glory? The Six Nations is here for the taking

The key thing to stress is that you do not need to force the tries or score off every phase. If England are clinical in execution then the points will come.

I would paste up on the wall of the changing room a poster of numbers - the lowest error count in a Six Nations match, the highest number of turnovers, the highest number of tries, and demand the team beat those figures.

No team have ever managed three or fewer handling errors or turnovers in a match. If you commit no errors you keep the intensity of the game up and the ball in play for longer.

This Six Nations is still there for the taking. I just hope England realise that.
