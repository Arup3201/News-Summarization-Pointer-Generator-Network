A federal jury in New York on Thursday handed a legal victory to U.S. billionaire William Koch and awarded him damages in his dispute over the alleged misrepresentation of 24 bottles of wine he bought at auction, one of the attorneys said.

Koch, 72, the founder of Oxbow Group energy company and worth an estimated $4 billion, 
bought the vintage wine as an investment in a 2005 Zachys
Wine Auctions but claims tech entrepreneur Eric Greenberg knowingly sold him counterfeit bottles of wine.

Koch filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in 2007, accusing Greenberg, the San Francisco-based founder of several Internet companies, of fraud and misrepresentation and seeking $320,000, the amount he paid for the 24 bottles.

'There was a code of silence in this bloody wine business, and now it's been broken,' Koch said after he won his lawsuit.

'I can't stand being cheated. But the worst thing of all is that counterfeiting degrades the love of the vintner for his wine,' he added, according to the Wine Spectator.

The federal jury started deliberations on Thursday afternoon and returned early evening, after just two hours, with its verdict that Koch should be compensated for the amount he spent on the wine, Greenberg's attorney Arthur Shartsis said.

Koch had spent $3.7 million at a Zachys auction for 17,000 bottles from Greenberg's cellar in an October 2005 sale.

He alleged that 24 of the bottles he purchased were not real and accused Greenberg of fraud.

Experts for both sides agreed that the wine in one of the 24 bottles is fake. The authenticity of the other 23 bottles was unclear, although expert witnesses testified that some of the labels were copies of the originals.

Greenberg denied the charges, saying any forgeries from his wine cellar got to the auction house by mistake.

None of the bottles has been opened nor the wine tasted.

In closing arguments on Thursday, Shartsis told the jury his client did not knowingly sell fakes.

He argued that the New York-based Zachys auction house sold the bottles 'as is,' meaning the buyer accepted the product in whatever condition it was at the time.

Greenberg's contract with the auction house did not require him to prove the wine was real, the attorney said.

Bottle of Chateau Latour (1928) - $2,873

Bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1811) - $29,172

Magnum of Chateau Petrus (1921) - $29,500

Magnum of Chateau Lafleur (1921) - $18,564

Bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1870) - $18,564

Three magnums of Chateau Lafleur (1945) - $57,000 total

Bottle of Chateau Petrus (1928) - $17,238

Magnum Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1870) - $33,150

Bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1805) - $22,542

Two bottles of Chareau Mouton Rothschild (1900) - $10,114 total

Bottle of Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1900) - $11,977

Chateau Lafite Rothschild (1805) - $22,542

'Eric didn't know if the bottles were fake,' the attorney said afterward.

Koch's
lawyer John Hueston said in court that Greenberg withheld information 
about the provenance and authenticity of his wine collection.

Koch,
whose brother David Koch is a major supporter of conservative political
causes, settled a separate lawsuit with the auction house in 2011, 
details of which were kept private.

Bill Koch has become a crusader against counterfeit wines being slipped into wine auctions.

'Collectors and individual sellers don't want anyone to know they have fake wine,' he told Wine Spectator earlier this year.

'They want to dump it on others. I'm the only guy who's blowing the whistle on it.'

Sources close to the billionaire estimate he has spent $10 million on legal fees for the lawsuit but Mr Koch insists the money is well spent in the prevention of fraud.

The case shines new light on the astronomical prices paid by wealthy collectors at auction for wine.

Mr
Koch, from Florida, first brought the lawsuit against his Californian 
rival in 2007, accusing him of auctioning off more than three dozen 
'fake' bottles, which he bought for $460,000.

But
the claim now involves 24 of the bottles, and wine expert William 
Edgerton is expected to testify that he raised suspicions about two of 
them when inspecting Mr Greenberg's cellar in 2002.

The expert had been called in when Sotheby's decided against auctioning them because of doubts over their authenticity.

Papers
filed at the court house claim Mr Greenberg told Christie's officials, 
after selling the wine to Mr Koch, that there was 'no garbage' left in 
his cellar because it had been sold.

Mr Koch has reportedly pursued litigation against four auction houses and various wine sellers since 2005 when he discovered
four bottles of French wine, which he had bought and were said to have 
been owned by former U.S. president Thomas Jefferson, were bogus.

Mr Greenberg has a wine collection of more than 70,000 bottles, and his spokesman Bill Cunningham said that no one denies that in such a large number there will be some fakes.

He said: 'But to go from that and say, 'because you have them you are guilty of fraud', is a big jump.'

Mr Cunningham claimed Mr Koch has spent $10 million in legal fees so far, but would not say how much Mr Greenberg has spent.

Wine expert Jim Hammond said the hefty price tags attached to vintage wines are down to exclusivity, such as age and where they are from, and not taste.

Los Angeles School of Wine founder, Martin Weiner, said it is extremely difficult to prove authenticity of vintage wine, which has led to more fake bottles on the market.

Mr Greenberg made his billions after founding dot-com companies, Viant and Scient, while Mr Koch, a sailor who won the 1992 America Cup, has a wide portfolio of oil and other investments.
