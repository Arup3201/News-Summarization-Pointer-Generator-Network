The parents of a 12-year-old girl who was brutally stabbed 19 times by  classmates hoping to impress the fictional character Slender Man have come forward for the first time.

Appearing on camera in an interview with ABC's 20/20, which will air in full on Friday, the unidentified parents described the heart-wrenching moment they saw their daughter in hospital after she was stabbed and left for dead in a park in Waukesha, Wisconsin in late May.

'She was as pale as a ghost,' the girl's mother told ABC News' David Muir. 'She was terrified, she was crying, she couldn't breathe.'

Heartbroken: The girl's mother described her shock at seeing her daughter in hospital for the first time

She went on: 'She saw me and she put her hand out and I hugged her and I told her, "you're going to be OK, it's going to be fine". But I could see that she was covered in stab wounds.' 

Looking over the wounds to her daughter's body, she counted five on her arm and seven on her leg. 

'I heard one nurse say, "I count 19",' the mother said. 

Despite the wounds, their daughter battled through, telling her parents: 'I wanted to live.'

'She's an amazing child,' her mother said, while her father added: 'She's definitely our hero.'

The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009.

The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit.

The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia.

It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport.

It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009.

It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'.

The little girl will also appear in the interview on 20/20 on Friday at 10pm.

She has not been identified or previously pictured, apart from an image showing her being carried away on a stretcher. 

Her attackers, Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, have since been charged as adults for first-degree intentional homicide but questions remain over whether they will be competent to stand trial. 

Weier and Geyser told investigators they stabbed the girl to impress Slender Man, a tall, fictional bogeyman popular on the Internet that they insisted was real, according to a criminal complaint.

In an official police report Weier said Slender Man is the 'leader' of Creepypasta, and she needed to kill to show their loyalty.

She explained Geyser told her they needed to slaughter their friend  to become 'proxies' of Slender Man and gain access to his mansion, which they believed was located inside northern Wisconsin's Nicolet National Forest.

They planned to kill the victim and then walk to the mansion. 

Geyser was allowed to have two friends over for her birthday, and she and Weier planned the murder for that Friday night.

Arrests: Anissa Weir, left, and Morgan Geyser, right, allegedly stabbed the girl after inviting her over for a sleepover. They had wanted to impress a fictional horror character, Slender Man, with the killing

In court: Weier is pictured in court in June, but doctors have deemed she is not competent to stand trial

Charged: Weier, also charged as an adult, is undergoing competency tests to determine if she can stand trial

But they changed their plans and they decided to kill her in a bathroom at a nearby park the next morning. Weier told police she knew there was a drain in the floor for the blood to go down.

When they left for the park the next morning, Geyser hid the knife tucked away in her waistband.  

They planned to play hide and seek with the victim and then kill her when they were out of sight, in the trees. 

It was in the seclusion of the woods that one of the girls held down the victim while the other frantically stabbed their friend 19 times.

Weier said that the victim was so badly injured she couldn't breathe, see or walk and that they left her lying on the ground in a pool of blood.

Despite her numerous wounds, she was able to crawl out of the woods and to safety where a bicyclist found her and called 911. The victim spent six days in the hospital. 

The two young suspects were arrested several hours later at a furniture store where police found Weier had a five-inch blade in her backpack.

Geyser and Weier face up to 60 years in prison if convicted as adults of attempted homicide. They could be incarcerated to age 25 if they are convicted as juveniles under state law. 

Two doctors concluded that Geyser was mentally incompetent to stand trial and Weier is currently undergoing competency tests, which must be completed by mid-October.
