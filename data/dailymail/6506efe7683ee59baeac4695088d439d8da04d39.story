The family of a Rochester real estate mogul and his wife whose private plane crashed near Jamaica in September says the plane’s wreckage has been recovered from the ocean depths.

Larry and Jane Glazer, both 68-year-old experienced pilots, were flying from Rochester to Naples, Florida, on September 5 when air traffic controllers lost contact with their single-engine turboprop. 

The 'ghost plane' flew on its own for 1,700 miles before running out of fuel and slamming into the sea. 

In a statement released Wednesday, the Glazer family said they hired the Eclipse Group of Maryland to search for the plane and their parents’ remains.

Finally retrieved: Larry and Jane Glazer were killed in September when their private plane went down off the coast of Jamaica. Their bodies were not recovered until this week

'Due to the circumstances surrounding the crash, (including a water depth in excess of 3,000 meters), this goal proved extremely challenging,' wrote the family.

They said the search was successful as of Wednesday and the remains would be brought home.

'It is with great relief that we will be bringing our parents home. We also recovered significant portions of the aircraft itself and we are hopeful that, in time, this will provide us with answers as to exactly what happened that day,' the said in the statement signed by the couple's children Mindy MacLaren, Rick Glazer and Ken Glazer.

The husband and wife both had their pilot's license. Authorities believe they likely fell unconscious after a dangerous loss of cabin pressure mid-flight

On September 5, 2014, the aircraft carrying our parents crashed in the ocean north of Jamaica. Since that day, we have been resolute in our goal of bringing our mother and father home to Rochester. Due to the circumstances surrounding the crash, (including a water depth in excess of 3,000 meters), this goal proved extremely challenging. After the tireless efforts of many, we were able to commence a search earlier this month. We employed the services of the Eclipse Group, Inc. out of Maryland to plan and conduct a search for our parents and any remains of their plane.

That search was a success, and so it is with great relief that we will be bringing our parents home. We also recovered significant portions of the aircraft itself and we are hopeful that, in time, this will provide us with answers as to exactly what happened that day. We are grateful for the expertise available to us, as well as the care brought to this situation by all parties. Our family would like express our heartfelt gratitude to Steve Saint Amour and his team at the Eclipse Group for making this possible. Without their expertise and tireless efforts, we would not have been able to bring our parents home. We also want to send a special thanks to the Government of Jamaica, particularly the Maritime Authority of Jamaica and the Civil Aviation Authority of Jamaica, for going above and beyond the call of duty in order to help our mission succeed.

Knowing we did all that could be done to bring our parents home provides us with the possibility for closure and eventual healing. We appreciate all of the support we have received from the Rochester Community throughout this time.

Thank you. 

Mindy MacLaren, Rick Glazer, and Ken Glazer

Ghost plane: The plane flew some 1,700 miles on its own before finally crashing into waters north of Jamaica

Their father, Larry Glazer, was seen slumped over the controls by a fighter jet sent to escort the plane. He and his entrepreneur wife Jane, both died in the crash.

Their plane, which took off from New York on the morning of September 5, sparked panic when the pilot stopped responding to radio calls about an hour after take-off and passed its destination of Naples, Florida.

It continued flying south for several hours at an altitude of 25,000 feet before entering Cuban airspace and heading towards the Caribbean, eventually crashing 14 miles North East of Port Antonio.

A pilot who intercepted the Glazers said he believed Mr. Glazer was still alive, but unconscious. 

'I can see his chest rising and falling,' he said in a recording of his dispatch. 'Right before I left...we could see that he was actually breathing.'

The plane also had 'frosted windows', an indication of a sudden loss of cabin pressure and officials said they suspected hypoxia - a deprivation of oxygen - could have caused them to pass out. 

Search party: Jamaican Marine Police return to the Port Antonio Marina after a fruitless search for the plane that wouldn't be recovered for months

The pilot of an F-15 fighter would report that Mr. Glazer appeared to be unconscious but still breathing in the aircraft as it cruised toward the Caribbean on its own

According to ABC, the pilot requested to fly lower during two calls to air traffic control. However, when they asked if he wanted to declare himself in a state of emergency, he said no.

The plane was flying at 28,000 feet at 10 am when Glazer asked to descend to 18,000 feet because of an issue with the plane, ABC reported.

He was cleared to drop to 25,000 feet but then asked to go lower.

Air traffic control denied the second request because of the traffic traveling below Glazer.

They said if he made a left turn he could bypass the traffic and descend.

He made the turn, but then stopped responding.

The plane went down 14 miles north of Jamaica went it ran out of fuel.  Investigators will now use wreckage to try and determine what caused the tragedy
