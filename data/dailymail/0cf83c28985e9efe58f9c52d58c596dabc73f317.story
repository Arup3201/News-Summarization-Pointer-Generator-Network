Latest arrest: This is George Zimmerman's mugshot from the Seminole Sheriff's Office in Florida after his arrest on Friday night for assault and domestic violence with a weapon

Following his recent arrest for allegedly throwing a wine bottle at his girlfriend, George Zimmerman's lawyer has admitted his client 'has not been lucky with the ladies.'

Zimmerman, whose acquittal of murdering an unarmed black teen sparked a national debate on race and self-defense laws, was arrested for aggravated assault in Lake Mary about 10 p.m. Friday and is being held at the John E. Polk Correctional Facility.

His attorney, Don West, said the incident involved the 31-year-old allegedly tossing a wine bottle at his girlfriend earlier this week at his Lake Mary home.

West said he did not want to 'speculate' about the situation that led to the alleged assault, reports NBC.

During a court appearance Saturday morning, Zimmerman's bond was set at $5,000 and he was ordered to avoid contact with the woman who was not identified.

Judge John Galluzzo gave few details of the incident, but said a wine bottle was involved and that the alleged assault happened at Zimmerman's home.

Prosecutors questioned whether substance abuse treatment was needed, but the judge said that didn't seem to be a factor. 

It is not known at this time who the girlfriend is but Zimmerman was known to be living with Samantha Scheibe earlier this year.

Police arrested Zimmerman after his girlfriend told them about the row when they pulled her over for a routine traffic stop. 

Zimmerman was also told by the judge to stay out of Volusia County, where the alleged woman lives.

The judge ordered Zimmerman to pack up any personal belongings his girlfriend may have left at Zimmerman's home and give them to his lawyer.

Zimmerman, who wore blue scrubs and handcuffs, appeared calm during the brief hearing. At one point, he laughed and joked with an officer as he signed paperwork.

Although the incident didn't involve a firearm, the judge ordered Zimmerman to surrender any weapons out of an abundance of caution.

Zimmerman is scheduled to appear back in court on Feb. 17.

Zimmerman was infamously acquitted in 2013 of a second-degree murder charge for the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager, Trayvon Martin.

Indeed, since his acquittal for Martin's murder, Zimmerman has been arrested three times by Lake Mary police.

Zimmerman was infamously acquitted in 2013 of a second-degree murder charge for the fatal shooting of unarmed teenager, Trayvon Martin.

The first time was in September 2013, when his estranged wife, Shellie Zimmerman, called 911 and claimed he had attacked her father and threatened he with a gun.

She decided to not press any charges.

The second time was in November, 2013, when Zimmerman was arrested for domestic violence against girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe.

However, she also later dropped charges.

The third time was in September, 2014, when Zimmerman was arrested for a road rage incident.

After crossed words with a truck driver, Zimmerman allegedly asked the driver, 'Do you know who I am?', before allegedly saying, 'I'll (expletive) kill you.'

-NOVEMBER 2013: He was arrested on charges of aggravated assault, battery and criminal mischief after his then-girlfriend said he pointed a gun at her face during an argument, smashed her coffee table and pushed her out of the house they shared. Samantha Scheibe decided not to cooperate with detectives and prosecutors didn't pursue the case.

- SEPTEMBER 2012: Zimmerman was accused by his estranged wife of smashing an iPad during an argument at the home they had shared. Shellie Zimmerman initially told a dispatcher her husband had a gun, though she later said he was unarmed. No charges were ever filed because of a lack of evidence. The dispute occurred days after Shellie Zimmerman filed divorce papers.

- Zimmerman has also been pulled over three times for traffic violations since his acquittal
