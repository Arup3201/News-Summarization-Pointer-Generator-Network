These spectacular pictures show a row of 300-year-old thatched cottages going up in flames as 102 firefighters battle to keep the blaze under control.

The fire destroyed three historic homes that have stood in the well-heeled Hampshire village of East Meon since the 18th century as crews from across the country rushed to the scene last night.

Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said yesterday was a 'very busy' Bank Holiday Friday as crews were called out to other two blazes at properties with thatched roofs.

A row of thatched cottage going up in flames in Hampshire as firefighters battle to keep the blaze under control

At 11.19am nine pumps and 54 
firefighters tackled a blaze in Dibden which left the roof and first 
floor of a property with 100 per cent damage and the ground floor 50 per
cent damaged.

At 4.29pm, the service was called out
to a second thatched property fire in Wherwell, Andover. This time 10 
pumps were called out to the cottage and 72 firefighters attended.

The roof was left 90 per cent damaged before the blaze was brought under control. The three fires are not believed to be linked and the circumstances are not suspicious.

A spokesman for Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service said last night: 'Hampshire Fire and Rescue are currently attending a thatched roof fire 
covering three properties.

'The latest informative timed at 23.08 hours 
confirms that the fire involves a thatch of three premises, salvage work
is in progress and protection of the surrounding properties.

'Five jets 
have been in use, two hosereels, eight breathing apparatus and an Aerial
Ladder Platform monitor.

'Approximately one hundred and two firefighters
attended this incident although it is now scaling down.'

Elsewhere, the owners of a piggery will assess the damage today after a fire ripped through the building, killing up to 900 animals.

Up to 50 firefighters tackled the blaze for three hours yesterday at Seaborough Manor near Beaminster, Dorset.

The fire swept through the roof of the 330ft-long piggery at 6.30am yesterday, destroying it.

Investigators are now looking into the cause of the blaze, and fire crews remained at the scene on the farm throughout the night.

A spokeswoman for Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said yesterday: 'There was 100 per cent severe damage to the piggery and sadly approximately 900 pigs lost their lives in the fire.

'There was an asbestos roof involved in the fire with no affect to any other properties. Crews were at work protecting adjacent piggeries and property.'

The blaze is the second in less than a year to hit a Dorset farm piggery and kill large numbers of livestock.

A total of 180 piglets and 18 sows died at Corton Farm in Friar Waddon, Weymouth, when fire engulfed a farming unit in May last year.

The large farrowing unit suffered severe fire damage and none of the pigs survived.
