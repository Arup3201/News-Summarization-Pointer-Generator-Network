An Engadget source recently revealed that HTC's upcoming M8 Ace smartphone will feature a plastic body instead of one made from aluminum

HTC may have turned its nose up at its competitors' plastic handsets, but the Taiwanese company could soon be offering its own cut-price version.

An Engadget source recently revealed that HTC's upcoming M8 Ace smartphone will feature a plastic body instead of one made from aluminum. 

This would place it in direct competition with the recently-launched Samsung Galaxy S5 which also features a plastic shell.

The M8 is expected to have almost identical features to its competitor, including a 5-inch 1080 pixel display and a 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor.

Speculation still surrounds whether the M8 Ace will also have the Duo Camera feature, which, along with the cheaper price, could set it apart from the Galaxy S5.

Up until now, the only information on the plastic HTC handset has been a blurred out picture courtesy of @evleaks.

But a source recently told Richard Lai at Engadget that the phone could launch next month for around £285 ($480).

This is significantly cheaper than its competitor with prices for a SIM-free Galaxy S5 starting at £570 in the UK and $649 in the U.S.

The news is another blow to Samsung who earlier this week admitted a bug in its Galaxy S5 phone is causing the handset's camera to die.

The Korean giant said the number of its flagship Galaxy S5 smartphones shipped with non-working cameras was 'very limited' and that it has taken measures to ensure the issue does not recur in new shipments.

Samsung has admitted a bug in its newly launched Galaxy S5 phone is causing the handset's camera to die.

The Korean giant said the number of its flagship Galaxy S5 smartphones shipped with non-working cameras was 'very limited'.

However, operator Verizon was forced to take to Twitter to make customers aware of the flaw, which renders the camera useless.

'[The problem] was caused by complications in the ROM (Read Only Memory) component which stores the information necessary to operate the camera,' Samsung said in an e-mailed statement.

A company spokeswoman on Monday declined to specify the number of phones that were affected but said the problem had been reported in the United States and a number of other countries.

Reports of the problem surfaced last week and come less than a month after the phone's global launch, with Samsung banking on the S5 to outdo its predecessor and rebuild momentum for the brand in an increasingly competitive market.

Adding to its woes, the South Korean company today reported a four per cent fall in sales at its mobile phone unit.

The group said that revenues in the sector fell to 33.4 trillion won ($32.3bn; £23.3bn) between January and March of this year.

However, operating profit for its mobile phone unit increased by 18 per cent from the previous three months.

The electronics giant also reported a net profit of 7.57 trillion won (£4.4bn; $7.5bn) for the first quarter – an increase of 7.3 trillion won (£4.2bn; $7bn) in the previous three months.

The group is thought to be preparing a metal-bodied version of its Galaxy S5, called the Galaxy S5 Prime, that could rival the metal-bodied HTC.
