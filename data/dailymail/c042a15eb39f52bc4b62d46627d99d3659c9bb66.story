An advert featuring a man speaking in a heavy Birmingham accent has provoked a furious response from the city's residents.

It shows a brightly-dressed couple trying to plan a romantic holiday, with the Hawaiian-shirted man repeatedly responding to the woman's requests with the phrase: 'Anything for you, cupcake'.

But the light-hearted commercial for travel site Hotels4u has riled Brummies, who claim it is 'offensive' and more annoying than the Go Compare advert, which sees a mustachioed opera singer bellowing out the company's name.

'Offensive' advert: The Hotels4u TV campaign features a couple planning a holiday, with the man repeatedly replying 'Anything for you cupcake' in a heavy Brummie accent. However, viewers have responded by saying it is unrealistic

They have taken to social media sites to attack the TV campaign, describing it as 'appalling' and criticising the actor's Brummie accent as unrealistic.

'I’m from Birmingham and have never heard any fellow Brummies speak like that!' Angela Dubberley said on Facebook.

'Go Compare sales went down thanks to that annoying Welsh bloke, I’ve a feeling Hotels4u is going to suffer the same fate!'

Helen Wolfe wrote: 'Most annoying advert in the world, even worse than Go Compare! And Gavin from Autoglass!'

Annoyingly familiar?: The company behind the Go Compare advert (pictured) are also responsible for the Hotels4u campaign. They used a Welsh opera singer for the comparison website's commercial and have decided to opt for a regional accent again

'Warm and friendly': Mike Hoban, marketing director for Hotels4u, said they wanted to create 'a popular duo that people would warm to'. Unfortunately for the campaign a number of people have responded to the TV campaign by saying they would never use the website

It is no coincidence that the adverts are being compared to each other as they were both created by the company headed by marketing couple Chris and Sian Wilkins.

They opted to repeat the use of the strong regional accent in the Go Compare ad, which features a Welsh opera singer.

Vianney Lawlor stated: 'Not a Brummie accent. That’s a Black Country accent.'

And Cactusrogeruk blasted: 'Bloody appalling! I can’t believe this is actually a serious attempt to speak like people anywhere!'

However, last night the holiday firm revealed actor Craig Painting who stars in the advert was born and bred in Northfield, Birmingham.

Mike Hoban, marketing director for Hotels4u, said: 'We wanted to create a popular duo that people would warm to. That’s why we cast a Birmingham born and bred actor as our lead character.

Having a laugh: The actors in the Hotels4u advert seem in good spirits but viewers are not so amused. Helen Wolfe wrote: 'Most annoying advert in the world, even worse than Go Compare!'

'We wanted to use a friendly accent from one of the great UK regions to help create a distinctive character so that people remember how easy it is to save money on hotel bookings.'

Hotels4u, part of Thomas Cook, said it wanted to come up with a 'truly memorable tagline' and characters who would become household names for the new TV campaign.

Born and bred Brummie: Critics of the advert have attacked the heavy accent, saying it sounds more like someone from the Black Country. But actor Craig Painting who stars in the advert was born and bred in Northfield, Birmingham

'Anything for you cupcake': The Brummie actor says the phrase repeatedly in response to his partner's holiday demands

Judging by the response on the social media sites, the advert could become memorable for all the wrong reasons.

'Your advertising campaign is a huge fail, I can imagine the majority of Brummies are offended and the rest of the country are confused,' said Rich Elwell.

'I’d never use your company in a million years.'
