An ambulance crew took nearly half an hour to get to a woman in cardiac arrest after their satnav system tried to send them the wrong way. 

Jodie Fields, 20, from Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex, died at her home on May 20, 2012, from sudden adult death syndrome. 

The university student, who was training to be a nursery nurse, had visited four different doctors in the three months before her death complaining of leg pain, a racing heart and breathing problems.

However, she was told she was suffering from stress and anxiety. 

Jodie's sister Kirsty called 999 after finding her unconscious at the flat which they shared. 

An inquest in Chelmsford heard a lone paramedic arrived minutes later but it took 24 minutes for an ambulance crew to arrive.

There were no crews available in near towns so the ambulance had to travel from Basildon which was about 10 miles away. 

Chris Smith, a paramedic on board, said he and his colleague used the satnav system because they were unfamiliar with the area. 

He said: 'The satnav tried to send us the wrong way down a one-way road. 

'We would not normally respond to calls in that area from Basildon. Ideally there would be more local crews.'

However, he said the satnav error may have set them back no more than a minute.

Miss Fields was declared dead half an hour after the ambulance crew arrived. 

Chelmsford Coroner's court also heard how Miss Fields had seen a doctor in the run-up to her death who had been placed under the supervision by the General Medical Council over his record keeping.

It took five visits to a doctor before she was referred to a cardiologist. 

Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said Miss Fields died from adult death syndrome and recorded a verdict of death by natural causes. 

But her family believe a 'catalogue of errors' contributed to the death of Miss Fields. 

Her sister Kirsty, 24, told The Sunday Mirror: 'It's disgusting we had to wait so long for an ambulance.

'I believe it cost Jodie her life.'

Her mother Karen added: 'It's just a catalogue of errors. All we want is to make sure this never happens to anyone else. We owe that to Jodie.'
