A devoted father lost six stone in less than a year because he feared his teenage son would be left orphaned.

Gerald Charles, 53, had never been worried about his weight - he soared to 18.5st enjoying chips, cakes and takeaways.

But when his wife, Carol, tragically died of cancer at just 45, Mr Charles realised he had to change his ways.

Gerald Charles, 53, lost six stone to drop from 18.5st (left) to 12st 6lbs (right) after his wife, Carol, died. He feared that his bad habits could result in his son, Edward, 14, being left an orphan

He suddenly realised his son Edward, 14, could be left alone in the world and decided he needed to lose some weight.

Mr Charles, who also has a 21-year-old son called Chris, who has left home, said: ‘I didn’t like the idea of Edward being an orphan and that was my inspiration.

‘I’d look in the mirror and grumble like everyone but it was only when it occurred to me I was damaging my body that I stopped.

‘I wanted to be around a lot longer for my family so I decided to do something about my size.’

Mr Charles says it was his wife's death that really inspired him to change.

Mrs Charles, who did not smoke, was diagnosed with cancer of the tongue in 2002.

She had radiotherapy and went into remission but the cancer returned in 2011.

It spread to her throat, mouth, shoulder and neck and despite chemotherapy she died in early 2012.

Following
 her death, the father-of-two joined Weight Watchers and bought a 
mountain bike to ride around the lanes near his home in Hereford.

The crematorium technician said: ‘After my wake-up call I have changed my lifestyle completely.

‘I have followed the diet to the letter and I cut back on bread, cake and all the things I really loved.

‘I bought myself an exercise bike and do about 25 kilometres a week on that.

Mr Charles (pictured with his wife) says that since his weight loss he feels much better and has more energy

‘Since losing weight I have far more energy and don’t seem to flag at the end of the day.

‘I have a lot more confidence and generally feel so much better.’

Mr Charles, now a healthy 12st 8lbs, still has a pair of XXXL jeans from when he was morbidly obese.

He said: ‘They swamp me now but I have kept them to remind me how big I was not to get that way again.

‘The biggest help to me was being so positive in what I wanted to achieve, which is being around a little longer for my family.

‘I am very happy about my weight loss but I’m still aware of the hard work which I have to do to keep the weight off.’

Janet Lawrence, who runs the Hereford Weight Watchers group, said Mr Charles was one of her star slimmers.

She said: ‘He has been such an inspiration to myself and the other members.

‘He is proof that you can lose weight and keep it off and still enjoy life.’
