Popstar Rihanna was asked to leave an Abu Dhabi mosque because she did not have permission for a photoshoot, it emerged today.

Staff at Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque say they asked the singer to leave the compound after her actions were considered to be at odds with the 'sanctity' of the site.

Photos posted on her Instagram account at the weekend show the 25-year-old posing on white marble wearing a head-to-toe hooded black jumpsuit.

She is known for her raunchy outfits so the photoshoot was deemed conservative for the Bajan singer, although she made sure she had bright red lipstick and large gold accessories. 

But today it emerged that Rhianna and her team was not given permission to take photos at the mosque, the main place of worship for Friday gathering and Eid prayers.

The
 mosque, which is the largest in the UAE and can hold more than 40,000 people, released a statement, and although it does not name Rhianna,
 it refers to a 'recent incident, involving a singer.'

'In the event of behaviour that violates 
the moral codes of access to the mosque, or other visit regulations – 
such as taking inappropriate pictures, posing in ways that are improper 
in the context of sacred place, talking loudly, or eating – the 
violators are directed in a polite manner that reflects the 
civilisational and tolerant attributes of Islam,' the statement read.

Still glamorous: The singer wore crimson lips and dark red fingernails, and added a statement gold necklace as she posed with a hoodie covering her head

Fitting in: The singer paid heed to the dress requirements in the Middle Eastern city, where local women tend to cover up their bodies

'Here,
 the Centre refers to a recent incident, involving a singer who came for
 a private visit to the mosque, at a gate that is not reserved for 
visitors, without prior coordination with the Centre’s management and 
without identifying herself,' it said reported The National.

It
 said the singer 'left without entering the mosque, after being asked to do so, due to the fact that she had taken some pictures that do not conform with the conditions and regulations put in place by the Centre’s management to regulate visits in a way that takes the status and sanctity of the mosque into consideration.'

Many of her fans attacked the singer for the photos which have since appeared on websites across the world.

'Rihanna may look gorgeous and all but she’s covering her head out of fashion not out of respect for the mosque,' wrote one user.

Sultry: Rihanna sat on the marbled floor outside the mosque at one point and pouted while looking into the distance

Is that entirely respectful? The singer takes a break on the floor

Another tweeter, @Ahmedcarter, wrote: 'Rihanna pics at Sheikh Zayed mosque are disrespectful to the place of worship.'

@BinttAlthee tweeted: 'Rihanna modelling in the Sheikh Zayed mosque is just plain wrong. Who let her in?'

On Instagram user msloca89 wrote under a photo of the singer: 'This is very disrespectful even if she is covered she is not suppose to take photos in the mosque. I don't think you would like to see a naked person taking photos in a church as well.'

While EmilyNovember wrote: 'Are these photos serious? I can't believe she is this wrapped up into her own 'looks' that she poses at a place like this. A place which represents the opposite of what she represents.'

Cultural expert Ali Al Saloom, 
the founder of AskAli.com, added: 'I feel disappointed that she shared 
photos on Instagram that are inappropriate to the values of our religion
 and our Arab tradition, which values modesty and respect to the most 
important venue that has our father of the nation HH Sheikh Zayed’s 
graveyard. A mosque is not to be seen as a fun place, nor is it a place 
for filming fashion,' reported 7DaysinDubai.

Nasif Kayed from the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Understanding said: 'In all of the pics she is dressed from head to toe.

'What is offensive about them? I’m sure that she was given the permission to be photographed in the manner in which she was. While each and all has their own opinion, in my opinion nothing in the photos is offensive.'

@mila_iggy responded to the images
 writing: 'I don’t see how Rihanna posing adjacent to a mosque in Abu 
Dhabi is disrespectful. If anything she’s showing respect by supporting the hijab.'

Not
 going so well: Fans were allegedly upset by her performance in 
Johannesburg on Sunday, claiming she lip-synched, pictured Thursday in 
concert in Cape Town

Rihanna
 hasn't publicly responded to the actions by staff at the Sheikh Zayed 
Grand Mosque which is a major tourist site in the United Arab Emirates' 
capital.

Earlier this year 
Madonna, was criticised for adopting Muslim clothing after being 
pictured wearing a chainmail mask resembling a niqab.

Rihanna is currently on her Diamonds world tour, having just arrived in the country after playing shows in South Africa.

Her fans in Johannesburg were 
reportedly outraged at her performance on Sunday night.

They complained that her alleged lip-synching and lacklustre performance 
wasn't worth the high price of the concert ticket, according to 
RadarOnline.

Johannesburg's main newspaper The Star ran Ri-Ri Rip-Off on its front page on Monday, calling her performance 'below-par'.

'It
 was obvious,' the paper's staff photographer Sharon Seretlo said of 
RiRi’s purported lip-synching. 'You know when someone is lip-synching. I
 was in the Golden Circle [close to the stage]. I could see it.'

'I don’t feel the ticket prices were fair considering the level of performance,' fan Nicole Contini added.
