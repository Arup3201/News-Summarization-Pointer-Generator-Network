Nani believes he could still have a future at Manchester United despite being allowed to spend the entire season on loan at Sporting Lisbon.

The Portugal winger was sacrificed by Louis van Gaal as part of the deal that saw Marcos Rojo join United last summer.

But Nani, 28, has more than three years still remaining on his Old Trafford contract, and insists it was his choice to head back to his homeland.

'The club know my value and I know they want me to stay,' he told the Manchester Evening News. 'It was me who made the choice to leave the club and it was a good decision by me because I knew if I stayed one more season at Old Trafford, it would be very hard for me.

'I just need someone to believe in me, trust me and my qualities, and give me an opportunity to show them on the pitch.'

The Portugal international added: 'It's an experience I wanted a lot and needed as well because the last two seasons at Manchester United I had so many injuries and I was very upset with a lot of things that happened to me.

'I was missing my family and friends and I wanted something new. The only opportunity I had to be happy, and Manchester United to be happy as well, was this one.'

The Portugal international has so far scored seven times in 19 appearances back at Sporting Lisbon
