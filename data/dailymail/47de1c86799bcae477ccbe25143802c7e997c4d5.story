Wolverhampton Wanderers are among the clubs interested in taking Anthony Knockaert on loan from Leicester ahead of this week’s deadline.

Leicester are understood to be prepared to loan out the 23-year-old French midfielder who signed two years ago from Guingamp.

Knockaert made 48 appearances for the club in their promotion season but has not started in the Barclays Premier League since the opening day draw with Everton.

He came on as a late substitute in the 0-0 draw against Sunderland on Saturday.

Blackburn meanwhile are interested in Wolves’ 23-year-old Dutch winger Rajiv van la Parra as they seek more pace in wide areas.

Football League clubs have until Thursday to complete any loan deals. After that, they must wait until the transfer market reopens on January 1.
