It was picnic time at Henley-on-Thames today despite the sun failing again to make an appearance.

Champagne was flowing as rowing fans descended on the river bank for the second day of the Royal Regatta.

Colourful blankets were draped across the water's edge as racegoers feasted on gourmet picnics at the historic event, which has been staged in the picturesque Oxfordshire town since 1839.

Seeing stripes: Men along the river were kitted out in matching mustard striped blazers on the second day of Henley Royal Regatta at Henley-on-Thames

Glossy-looking young women mingled with chaps in chinos and the brightly coloured jackets worn by rowing club members.

Ladies favoured a fashionable combination of maxi dresses teamed with oversized sunglasses, - and flat sandals seemed to be preferred to perilously high heels.

In the Regatta Enclosure visitors 
clutched plastic pint pots filled with Pimms as they cheered on 
competitors on the river and waved at pleasure cruisers passing by.

There
was plenty of red, white and blue on the river bank as the American 
teams marked Independence day, despite being a long way from home.

Holly
Hatton, the rowing coach of Bromfield Acton-Boxborough School in the 
USA, looked suitable festive with a sequined bow tie and stars and strip
socks.

The American had brought a team of girls, aged 16 to 18 years, over to compete in the Regatta.

'Henley is such a unique experience,' said the coach.

Bright and bold: 88-year-old regatta fan George Roberts donned an emerald green blazer whilst another attendee went for a more statement look with his Union Jack design

Getting into the spirit: High spirited regatta goers wore bright blue striped blazer as they enjoyed the sun on the riverbanks today

All white! Some men went for more classic looks in white, cream and navy blazers

Sticking to the rules: The guidelines for the Steward's Enclosure stipulated that men must wear lounge suits, jackets or blazers with flannels and a tie or cravat

Quintessentially British: The Henley Regatta has been described as the last bastion of class in the British summer season

'It is the dressing up and pageantry of it, we just don't have anything like this in the UK.

'It is just so unique and allows our girls to really compete on the world stage.'

The Henley Regatta has been described as the last bastion of class in the British summer season.

While Ascot was renamed 'chavscot' and the stands at Wimbledon have become more rowdy, the Royal Regatta has stuck to its quintessential English traditions.

The guidelines for the Steward's Enclosure stipulated that men must wear lounge suits, jackets or blazers with flannels and a tie or cravat.

Women were told that they should wear dresses or suits and would not be admitted if their skirts did not have a hemline below the knee or if they were wearing divided skirts, culottes or trousers of any kind.

The officials who patrol the 
entrance of the private members club are known to refuse 'unsuitably 
dressed ladies' who do not meet their strict rules.

Pensioner Charles Eugster, aged 93 years, first came to the Henley regatta as a competitor with St Paul's School in 1938.

He now voisits every year - flying in each year from his home in Switzerland.

Today he explained how some things had definitely changed in the last 75 years.

'There have been some enormous changes,' said the pensioner who still likes to row despite his advancing years.

'The rowing equipment is completely different. Back then we had wooden oars and the boats were wooden.

'The athletic performance is also far higher than it was in my day.'

Special occasion: 'Its the atmosphere, it is the colour, the athletic performance and of course the ladies' hats which make Henley', say attendees

Mr Eugster explained that the river bank, with all it's bars and restaurants has also developed.

'There was a fairground and the Stewards' Enclosure was much smaller.

'It is absolutely wonderful taking part in the regatta and it is absolutely wonderful to be here.'

The last time Mr Eugster competed in the regatta was in 1948 when he rowed for Thames Rowing Club.

'It's the atmosphere, it is the colour, the athletic performance and of course the ladies' hats which make Henley.

'I would love to be one of those big strong handsome guys rowing.'

The prestigious rowing event costs a massive £2 million pounds to stage each year.

Over
the course of the five day event racegoers will drink there way through
4,500 bottles of Champagne and one ton of strawberries.

What ho! Stripey blazers, red trousers, Rayban Wayfarers, quiffs and ruddy good blokes... must be Henley regatta

One spectator said: 'It's the atmosphere, it is the colour, the athletic performance and of course the ladies' hats which make Henley'... (though he was of course forgetting the gentlemen's hats)
