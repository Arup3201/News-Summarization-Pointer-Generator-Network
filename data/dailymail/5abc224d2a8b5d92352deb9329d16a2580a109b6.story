Karl Lagerfeld last night joined in with the countdown to the Games as he launched a new collection at Selfridges with a glittering bash.

The Chanel creative head unveiled three collections under the Karl Lagerfeld brand: Karl and the premium line Karl Lagerfeld Paris, and a pop-up store selling unique designs created especially for Selfridges customers in honour of the Olympics under the moniker Team Karl.

But despite opening a store in time for the Games, Lagerfeld said he would not be one of the billions from around the world tuning in to the event when it kicks off this week.

Karl is in the house: Lagerfeld made an appearance at Selfridges last night to launch three lines into the store - including an Olympic-inspired collection called Team Karl

'I like the idea, I like the people, but the performances, 
they are something of a little unhuman now,' he said last night. 'I like the image and the 
idea better than to watch it.'

The logo for the Team Karl range shows
the designer 
standing in the traditional discus pose -- an arm swung back about to 
throw the disc - but still wearing his trademark suit and powdered hair.

Highlights of the collection include gold, silver and bronze logos on T-shirts with 
Lagerfeld's name on them, sunglasses in medal hues, and metallic trims int he form of glittering gold collars.

'It's a collection of today, he said. 'So it's the mood the way I see things, with a touch of humour and lightness in it.'

Actress Rosario Dawson turned up to 
pay tribute to the design legend, as did The Kills' Alison Mosshart, who
took to the decks at the event, Otis Ferry and socialite Lady Victoria 
Hervey.

A charming Karl 
posed for photos with fellow fashionista Daphne Guinness before 
disappearing in to the night - possibly to attend to his ultra demanding
kitten, Choupette - who he complained has been rather stealing his 
limelight of late.

The designer told journalists at the 
bash that he was in danger of being 'upstaged' by the white Siamese cat 
after it was revealed he had named a Chanel bag after his pet.

Lagerfeld said that Choupette is 'the most famous cat in the world' right now.

But despite being overshadowed by a kitten, Lagerfeld is still smitten.

'She's divine. She's the most 
beautiful cat I've ever seen, he said. 'I'm like parents who think their
children are the most beautiful. In fact, I 
have never seen another cat so beautiful as Choupette.
