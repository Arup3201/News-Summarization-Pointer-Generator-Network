North Korea has used a huge parade marking the 64th anniversary of the start of the Korean War to call for a 'final victory' against U.S. 'imperialists'.

Thousands gathered to watch and take part in the pro-government rally in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square, as party officials called upon civilians and military to assemble into a single force to take on the U.S. in what was described as a 'final confrontation'.

The parade came just hours after North Korean officials called the release of a new Hollywood movie starring Seth Rogan an 'act of war' because it features a comedy storyline about a plot to assassinate leader Kim Jong-un.

Troops: North Korean soldiers take part in the parade, pledging their support for leader Kim Jong-un. It came just hours after officials called the release of a new Hollywood movie starring Seth Rogan and James Franco an 'act of war' because it features a comedy storyline about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un

The state run Korean Central News Agency later reported an official statement describing the Korean War as 'aggression ignited by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet forces.'

'U.S. imperialists instigated traitor Syngman Rhee to launch a surprise 
invasion against the DPRK and killed Koreans by the most cruel means and
 methods and reduced this land to debris,' the National Peace Committee of Korea's statement added.

'Human history records the cruelest and the most shuddering crimes committed by the Hitler fascist junta during the Second World War but the atrocities perpetrated by the Yankee imperialists during the Korean war put the Hitler fascists into the shade in brutality, cruelty and barbarity,' it went on to say.

Officials also called for Koreans on both sides of the border to unite into a single army to destroy the U.S.

'All Koreans in the north and the south should courageously turn out in a
 sacred battle to deal sledge hammer blows at those enemies keen to 
bring the dark clouds of a nuclear war to the land,' they said.

'The U.S. and the puppet forces should not run amuck, clearly mindful of 
the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the second Korean war,' the statement went on to say.

The statement condemning the U.S. and South Korea was released just hours after a North Korean official condemned a new Hollywood film about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un as 'an act of war'.

The U.S. faces 'stern' and 'merciless' retaliation if it fails to block the release of the film, an unidentified spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry said.

He didn't mention the movie by name but was clearly referring to 'The Interview', which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco and will open in U.S. cinemas in October.

The film tells the farcical story of a talk-show host and his producer who land an exclusive interview with Kim Jong-un, and are then asked by the CIA to assassinate him. Kim Jong-un is played in the film by Randall Park - an U.S.-born actor whose parents moved to the country from South Korea.

Banner: Yesterday marked the 64th anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War in which more than 1.2million soldiers died on all sides. Memories of that war are particularly painful in the North, where several cities, including Pyongyang, were all but destroyed by U.S. forces

Anger: North Korea, which has no independent press, often holds foreign governments responsible for the content of their media. Pyongyang regularly warns Seoul to prevent independently owned newspapers from mocking or criticising its leadership, something banned within authoritarian North Korea, where the Kim family is revered
