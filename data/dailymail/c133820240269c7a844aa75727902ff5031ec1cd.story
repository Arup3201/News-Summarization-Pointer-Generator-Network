Tony Blair this afternoon issued a dramatic public apology to the victims of the IRA Hyde Park bombing for mistakes in a government scheme  which allowed suspected perpetrators to escape justice.

The former Prime Minister told victims that he 'took full responsibility' for a programme which saw around 200  'comfort letters' sent to fugitive terror suspects assuring them they would not face prosecution.

The letters came to light last year following the collapse of the trial of former IRA paramilitary John Downey - the main suspect for the 1982 London bombing which killed British 11 soldiers.

Mr Blair told MPs investigating the scheme that it was 'absolutely critical to the peace process' and without it the IRA may have returned to violence.

He said: 'If I had been saying we are not dealing with this in any way at all, you can never be certain of these things but I think it is likely that the process would have collapsed.

'The purpose on everything we have done was to create peace in Northern Ireland so that there were not more victims of terrorism and more families distressed and losing loved ones as a result of that terrorism.'

The former PM began the peace process scheme in 2000 which eventually saw 95 of the letters  issued by the Government to suspects linked by intelligence to almost 300 murders.

They told people they were not wanted at that time but did not rule out future prosecutions if new evidence became available.

The scheme was drawn up following pressure from Sinn Fein to allow the fugitives, who had they been in prison before 1998 would have been released under the Good Friday Agreement, to return to Northern Ireland.

Mr Blair said he was sorry for mistakes in the scheme which saw letters sent to terror suspects who the police were still perusing. But said he would not apologise to those who should have received the letters - those who were no longer wanted on terror offences.

He said: 'I accept full responsibility, because I was prime minster, for not having put in place the structure for this procedure that might have meant in the Downey case... that the letter would not have been sent and therefore the trial would have proceeded.

Mr Blair added: 'I am sorry for those people and I apologise to those people who have suffered as a result of that. But I am not going to apologise for sending those letters to those who should have received those letters, because without having done that, we would not have a Northern Ireland peace process. These people have suffered enormously from what has happened.'

He later said: ‘Something obviously went wrong because there were large numbers of people who said this person was still wanted and the letter was still send. Everybody has admitted that, as the judge said, a catastrophic error was made.’

The former PM had earlier been accused of being 'extremely disrespectful' to Parliament by repeatedly ducking requests to appear in front of the  committee.

In a letter sent last month, he wrote that he had 'nothing to say which will be new to you, the members of your committee or the people of Northern Ireland.' 

The committee has spent more than six months attempting to question Mr Blair over the secret deals that he made with Sinn Fein.

After failing to get Mr Blair's agreement, the committee  summoned him to appear.

In a letter to Mr Blair committee chair Laurence Robertson said: 'You have been in the UK regularly over the past few weeks, but you have not been able to find an hour or so to meet us.'

North Antrim MP Ian Paisley had accused the former PM of 'being on the run' from giving evidence. 

The review was commissioned by David Cameron following the collapse of the trial of John Downey - accused of being responsible for 1982 bombing.

During the case, it emerged that Mr Downey had been given a letter assuring him that he would not face prosecution.

A three-month inquiry into the 'comfort letters', led by Lady Justice Hallett, concluded that the scheme was not unlawful.

Instead, she said that there had been cases where 'not wanted' notices were issued to the wrong parties.

Mr Downey was released last year when a judge halted his prosecution for the Hyde Park bombing.

Household Cavalry Lieutenant Anthony 'Denis' Daly, 23, died in the explosion in Hyde Park on July 20 1982 alongside Trooper Simon Tipper, 19, Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, 19, and 36-year-old Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright.

Former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson has said the issue of on-the-runs started the day he was appointed in 1999 and mainly concerned Sinn Fein's Rita O'Hare.

Ms O'Hare, the party's representative to the United States, is one of the most high-profile fugitive republicans, having skipped bail to the Irish Republic in 1972 after her arrest in connection with the attempted murder of a soldier.

Sinn Fein has argued that those covered by the letters scheme supported the peace process.

Last year the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee complained that Mr Blair in effect had 'refused' to appear before the inquiry in person to answer questions about his government's role.
