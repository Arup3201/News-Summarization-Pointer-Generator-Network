The Metropolitan Police will pay more than £400,000 in compensation to a woman who had a child by an undercover officer, it was claimed today.

The woman, known only as Jacqui, has a son with Bob Lambert, who was revealed in 2012 as a member of the now-defunct Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) which placed officers in deep-cover roles between 1968 and 2008.

She was one of several women taking High Court action against the Met over the actions of officers like Lambert, whom she knew as ‘Bob Robinson’ when a young activist in the 1980s.

Jacqui is reportedly to receive £425,000 and in an interview with the Guardian and the BBC, she said she had been receiving psychiatric care after learning of his real identity as a police officer who was married with children.

She said: ‘The legal case is finished but there is no closure for me. There is the money, but there is no admission by the police that what they did was wrong, there is no meaningful apology and most importantly there are no answers.’

‘I don't know why I was singled out by the police to be duped into an intimate sexual relationship with Bob Lambert.

‘I don't know if he was paid overtime to be with me during the 14 hours of labour I went through giving birth to our son. I feel violated.’

In August four former SDS officers were told they faced no criminal charges for their actions. 

The Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to charge four officers with sexual misconduct offences.

The Met was previously forced to name two officers who allegedly had relationships with women activists in groups they infiltrated after High Court judge Mr Justice Bean ruled the force could not use its policy of ‘neither confirm nor deny’ (NCND) in response to the damages claims.

As a result, the force confirmed Jim Boyling and Bob Lambert were undercover police officers.

Request: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (pictured), the Met commissioner, has been told by the woman's lawyer that he should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships

Jules Carey, Jacqui's lawyer, told the Guardian and BBC that Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met commissioner, should publicly condemn the practice of undercover officers having sexual relationships.

Mr Carey told them: ‘The Metropolitan Police are prepared to criticise the conduct of an individual officer, Bob Lambert. They are even prepared to be critical of the unit he was from - but they refuse to condemn the practice itself.

‘It is time for the commissioner of Metropolitan Police to publicly commit to seeing the end of this shameful and abusive practice’.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said the force ‘unreservedly apologises for any pain and suffering that the relationship with Bob Lambert, an undercover officer, has had on this woman’ but said that it had ‘never had a policy that officers can use sexual relations for the purposes of policing’.

He said: ‘We recognise the impact that the revelation that he was an undercover police officer must have had both on her and her son.

From the outset we have dealt with this lengthy case with professionalism and sensitivity, completely understanding the gravity of the circumstances. We regret if this necessarily complex process has added to her distress.

‘We want to be, and have tried hard to be, as open as we possibly can. Arguing the need to maintain the policy of neither confirm nor deny in relation to undercover operations has never been a refusal to accept wrongdoing, but has been done solely to protect a vital policing tactic.'

Fathering a child while working undercover proved no barrier to Bob Lambert’s successful 30-year career with the Met Police.

In fact, after five years spent infiltrating Left-wing groups in the 1980s he was promoted to oversee more junior members of the notorious Special Demonstration Squad.

Over the next two decades he became an expert in combating Islamic and Right-wing extremism.

He was even awarded an MBE in 2008 for ‘services to police work’ after retiring into academia.

When Jacqui, the mother of Lambert’s child, recognised him in a report on the undercover policing scandal, she managed to track him down to St Andrews University.

He was reunited with his son, now in his 20s, and Jacqui learned Lambert’s other two children had died from a genetic heart defect – which thankfully, their son does not share.

Fighting back tears yesterday, Jacqui said she has become friends with Lambert and his second wife.

Describing their first conversation on the phone, she said: ‘I had not spoken to him since he walked out on me but I instantly knew it was him.’

Lambert now works as a lecturer in terrorism studies at St Andrews and is a part-time senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University.

He was also co-director of the European Muslim Research Centre at Exeter University for several years.

He is soon to publish a book on Anders Breivik, who killed more than 70 people in Norway in 2011.
