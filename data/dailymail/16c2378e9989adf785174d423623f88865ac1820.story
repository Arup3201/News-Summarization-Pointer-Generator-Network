A casino mogul once in favor of internet gaming has had a change of heart on grounds the sites can easily funnel money to terrorists.

Billionaire Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands, is backing a ferocious onslaught against online poker initiatives even as more states legalize the activity only a few years after the FBI shutdown sites across the nation.

Adelson, 80, has taken a stance different than most of the gambling industry, which sees online poker as yet another source of revenue in the face of growing regional competition taking tourists away from both Las Vegas and Atlantic City.

Internet jihad: Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of Las Vegas Sands Corp., speaks at a 2012 news conference - he has become a ferociously opposed to online gamlbing in recent years after initially supporting it a decade ago

The tycoon’s opposition has been so fierce that a Politico article earlier this year called it his ‘internet jihad.’

The latest salvo in this ongoing war against online poker is a commercial showing two people shaking hands in a dark alley. This cuts quickly to a mother and young child in a poorly-lit bedroom distraught as police sirens blare in the background.

‘An established al-Qaeda poker network could extract enough untraceable money from the United States in just a few days to fund several 9/11-sized attacks,’ an intimidating voice says.

‘Say no to internet gambling.’

It is a strong departure from a 2001 Washington Post interview in which he said online poker was ‘a promising opportunity,’ according to The Verge.

Two years later, Las Vegas Sands spent more than $1million to explore the idea of running an offshore gaming operation in the U.K.. according to the New York Times.

Also in opposition: Steve Wynn, chairman and chief executive officer of Wynn Resorts Ltd., speaks during a 2011 interview in Macau, China - he has also taken up Adelson's cause

He was expected as recently as 2011 to support a bill to legalize online card tables but shockingly came out against a Justice Department ruling granting states the right to allow the operations at their own discretion.

‘It’s a threat to our society,’ Adleson wrote in a Las Vegas Sun editorial, ‘a toxin which all good people ought to resist.’

Online gaming technology is not advanced enough to keep underage players away and prevent money laundering, he argued. 

Addiction will be harder to curb, land-based casinos will take further hits to business and Facebook will ‘squash’ the whole industry, the titan insisted.

He further told Forbes in 2013 that he is ‘willing to spend whatever it takes’ to stop his biggest enemy from proliferating across the country.

The baccarat baron has so far spent millions and also amassed an army of lawyers and lobbyists to defeat online poker measures from being passed.

Fellow casino billionaire Steve Wynn has also taken Adelson’s side while Boyd Gaming, Caesars Entertainment and MGM have backed poker bills.

Critics have claimed both men are out of touch, and that they are against the technology only because they don’t understand it.

‘Sheldon’s old, and Steve is virtually blind,’ a Las Vegas industry insider told The Verge. ‘I’ll guarantee you neither of them have ever been on the internet. I don’t think they understand the world that is there at all.’

Both men have been vocal about their disdain for texting and email, and Wynn ridiculed an online gaming demonstration he recently saw.

‘I’m sure it was impressive if you were a cyber guy,’ Wynn told Politico. ‘But it was bulls**t.’

Almost two-thirds of the country, 63 per cent, opposes online gambling, according to a recent Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind poll. But 65 per cent say they don’t even follow the issue.

Nearly 10 states considered legalizing online gambling last year as Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey went all-in. California and Pennsylvania are reportedly on the verge of making it legal.

Adelson appears to be fighting an uphill battle.
