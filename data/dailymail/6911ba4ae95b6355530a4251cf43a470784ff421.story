A doctor with terminal cancer plans to tweet from her deathbed so people can understand what the experience is like.

Dr Kate Granger, 31, went through five rounds of chemotherapy after her diagnosis in July 2011 and was told she was unlikely to live longer than five years.

But the sessions left her so ill she decided to stop receiving treatment and concentrate on enjoying a good quality of life with her family and friends.

Last week, the elderly care specialist asked her 3,200 Twitter followers: 'Any suggestions for an appropriate # for me to use when eventually I am actively popping my clogs & live tweeting the experience?'

Since her diagnosis, Dr Granger, from Wakefield, found that dark humour helped her and husband Chris Pointon to cope with their situation.

Suggestions from her followers included: '#deathbedlive, #finalcountdown, #exfactor, #onedieseveryminute, #goinggoinggone' and '#toinfinityandbeyond'.

Some asked her if she was serious about her tweeting plans, to which she said she was 'deadly' so.

'I thought it would be quite interesting for everyone to understand more about what the experience is like for me,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

'If my tweets about my death and what I’m going through make one person talk to their loved one about what they would do that’s a good thing.

'Positivity and humour help me get through the day and deal with what I’m going through.'

After her tweets, she published a blogpost entitled 'Dying - can it ever be a laughing matter?'

She
 wrote: 'Don’t get me wrong, I definitely wasn’t making jokes on day one
 but soon after I started to use humour to help me get through the day.

'Some
 people around me were shocked by this attitude and language at first, 
but it’s amazing how infectious it is and how it normalises this huge 
life event that is approaching for me.'

Dr
 Granger, who returned to work at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield 
after treatment, has written a book about her illness, which was 
serialised in the Daily Mail last year.

She was diagnosed in August 2011 after she began suffering pains on the right side of her back while on holiday in the U.S.

When
 she returned, her husband took her to A&E where tests revealed a 
huge mass in her abdomen and pelvis, some of which encased her ureters —
 the tubes connecting the kidneys and bladder.

She was diagnosed with a desmoplastic
 small round cell tumour - an aggressive and rare tumor that primarily 
occurs as masses in the abdomen.

In one extract from The Other Side, the proceeds of which go to the Yorkshire Cancer Centre, she said her illness had made her a better doctor.

She wrote: 'It’s made 
me realise how important the little things are — holding a patient’s 
hand, sitting down with them and not standing over them, communicating 
news in a compassionate way and explaining the impact on them to their 
families.'

In January, she wrote again in the Mail how she had decided not to have any more treatment. She described the misery of spending New Year's Eve in hospital with an infection and decided the 'burdens' of treatment outweighed the benefits. 

She wrote: 'Although upset, I feel quite peaceful. I’ve got much further with the treatment than I ever expected to. Chris accepts my decision. A few friends and family have said they think I’m giving up too soon — but I’m choosing to take control of how I live. I just want my old life back, even for a couple of months.'

She also described how, 'as a control freak', she had planned every detail of her funeral such as the music, poems, prayers and dress code.

'I’ve written letters and cards to Chris up to his 70th birthday. I am now writing letters to other close family.'

She also returned to work, saying: 'I am in pain but so pleased to be at work. If patients ask, I tell them I have cancer, otherwise I never mention it.

'Having cancer has changed me. It’s made me realise how important the little things are — holding a patient’s hand, sitting down with them and not standing over them, communicating news in a compassionate way and explaining the impact on them to their families.

'I wrote this diary in the dark hours of my hospital stays. I want it to be in every medical school and hope my colleagues read it and think about how they practise medicine.

'Meanwhile, Chris and I are working through my bucket list — experiences I want to have while there’s still time. We renewed our wedding vows in April, had tea at The Savoy, have been to Paris and we’re going to Barcelona.

'I am blessed with my life — I have a job, husband and close family who I love very much, and I hope I’ve made a difference. Yes, I’m going to die but I’ve had time to prepare for this — I’m luckier than most.'
