A mother-of-one who became so overweight that she got wedged in a park swing has lost a staggering 14 stone in just under two years.  

Louise Lister,  weighed 27 stone and was wearing a size 36 this time 18 months ago, but after finding herself in the embarrassing predicament while taking her daughter to the park she vowed to change her ways.

The 41-year-old, from Workington, Cumbria, said that she knew something had to be done when just getting around became a daily struggle.

'Being the weight I was I always worried about breaking things and when I sat on the swing I could feel I was stuck - the chains were painfully digging into my sides and I was panicking that it would break.

'It was so embarrassing. I knew I had to do something about my weight. I didn't like being in pain from all the weight I was carrying around - I used to suffer terribly with my joints and back.

'The simplest of tasks made me out of breath and I wanted to be an active mum for my daughter Megan.'

Louise says that the simplest tasks would become a struggle and prevented her from becoming an active mother to her daughter Megan 

At a size 36 Louise would often struggle to find clothes that fit and had to settle with whatever she could find

Louise is now a svelte size 12-14 and is even hoping to inspire others as a Slimming World consultant 

Louise embarked on a radical diet overhaul, swapping her usual fish and chip dinner for home cooked Slimming World meals such as chilli con carne and chicken salads.

Louise says that she began to notice a difference almost immediately making her determined to continue with her weight loss.  

'As soon as the weight started coming off I immediately felt better. I had so much more energy and was determined to keep going with it.'

Louise managed to shed just under half her body weight, dropping 14st and is now a svelte size 12-14 frame. 

Louise and her husband Peter (pictured) used to live off a diet of greasy takeaways 

The pair have since swapped their high calorie dinners for home cooked meals and Peter has lost 10st too

The mother-of-one says that she enjoys shopping for outfits that show off her new figure.

'I am so pleased to finally be able to wear the clothes I want to- not just clothes from specialist plus sized shops.

'It was so hard for me to find anything that fitted at a size 36.

'I brushed it off and tried to pretend that my weight wasn't an issue but looking back now I am so glad I decided to lose the weight and become the healthy active mum my daughter deserves.'

Louise has continued her healthy lifestyle and now works out five days a week and loves Kettlercise and circuits.

BREAKFAST: Nothing

LUNCH: Crisps, chocolate, pie and chips 

DINNER: Takeaway - fish and chips, Mc Donald's or Chinese

BREAKFAST: Porridge, weetabix, yoghurt and fruit

LUNCH: Chicken salad, jacket potato or salad

DINNER: Chilli or steak and diet chips

The mother-of-one now uses her story to help inspire other women in her job as a Slimming World consultant. 

'I love exercise now and I can't believe how much fun I find working out. A year ago I couldn't get off the sofa without getting out of breath but now I'm doing circuits.

'I want everyone who wants to lose weight to realise how much Slimming World can change your life. It is such a healthy and effective way of losing weight.'

Louise has even manage to help her partner achieve a dramatic weight loss with her new approach to cooking.  

'My husband has even lost 10st as well, just by eating my healthy home cooked meals. It's been fantastic.'
