Futuristic plans have been unveiled to build Britain's first 'floating village' in the heart of London.

The scheme would turn the Royal Victoria Dock, which was an industrial powerhouse for more than a century, into an array of brightly-coloured houses, paths and restaurants on giant concrete 'stilts'.

But its unveiling today has sparked a furious row between London mayor Boris Johnson and local politicians, who say it will hasten London's slide into a millionaires' playground.

Dramatic: Plans have been unveiled for Britain's first 'floating village' in the old industrial heart of east London

Who would live in a house like this? Each home would be custom-built and perched on top of concrete piles driven into the base of the 160-year-old industrial dock - but there are fears over their high price

The entire 'village' - similar to many in the Netherlands - was described by Mr Johnson as floating but is set to be propped up on concrete piles driven underwater and through the floor of the dock.

It's claimed the 15-acre site next to the Emirates Air Line, Boris Johnson's prized cable car which was blasted by his critics as a white elephant, would become a 'thriving community' with 50 homes, restaurants, cafes and bars.

Each building would be connected by bridges and there would be a large events venue in the shadow of the nearby 69,000-capacity hall at the ExCeL Centre, which hosted events for the 2012 Olympics.

The luxury development would also feature offices, water sports, a floating Lido and even an ice rink.

Lead architect Professor Alex de 
Rijke, of London's Royal College of Art, designed the scheme after 
giving high-profile talks on floating villages in Venice.

Old and new: But the scheme has sparked a row with local politicians who say it is only for the super-rich

It would be similar to a 'floating village' in Ijburg, Netherlands, with each luxury house built off-site and shipped into place.

But the scheme has been blasted today as a 'yuppie ghetto' by the mayor of the borough of Newham - which will decide whether to grant planning permission next spring.

Sir Robin Wales said: 'We have always been clear that any new 
development must provide affordable housing and an acceptable mix of 
uses along with much needed long-term jobs for local people.

Mayor Boris Johnson said the scheme would host some of London's most sought-after homes

'The
 current plans for the Floating Village do not meet our vision or the 
Greater London Authority's own London Plan.

'Newham Council cannot, and 
will not, accept a development consisting purely of luxury apartments 
which will be out of reach of the majority of our residents.'

London mayor Boris Johnson's office was unable to say exactly what percentage of the scheme will be affordable at this stage.

But each house will be custom-built to its buyer's demands, raising the price, and the development will be surrounded by 'a blue water square, framed by a market square and a floating corniche.'

A spokesman for Mr Johnson insisted: 'The Mayor wants to ensure a significant proportion of low cost homes within this exciting new development, with social housing provider Genesis on board, and a commitment from City Hall to recycle all financial receipts from the scheme back into it for affordable homes and commercial space.'

Dug out in the heart of east London near what is now the financial hub Canary Wharf, the Royal Victoria Dock opened in 1855 and was a key part of Victorian Britain's powerful shipping trade.

The first of the 'royal docks', it was followed by the Albert Dock and King George V Dock. Together they became the largest enclosed docks in the world and reached their peak in the 1950s.

But as Britain's economy radically 
changed after the Second World War the docks declined, and by 1978 they 
were losing £9million a year.

Cargo
 gradually stopped being shipped up the Thames and went instead to sites
 further downriver including Tilbury in Essex, which is now home to a 
gigantic container terminal.

As it is now: Opened 1855, the Royal Victoria Dock is now part of the largest enclosed docks in the world. Pictured centre is the vast ExCeL venue, which opened in 2000 and hosted sports for the 2012 Olympics

Chris Brown, the director of Carillion Igloo Genesis, said: 'Living in a floating home you've helped to design is a dream lots of us have.

'By combining the floating home experience of our Dutch collaborators with our custom built business we hope to make these dreams come true in Royal Victoria Dock for a few lucky Londoners.

'East London's place on the tourist trail is growing fast. It's about to be joined by Europe’s largest floating village, with floating markets, creative workspace, events and watersports.'

The London mayor added: 'This site has the potential to become one of the most sought after 
addresses in the capital while breathing new life back into London’s 
waterways.'
