Mark Noble admits he did not enjoy most of last season at West Ham with manager Sam Allardyce’s future a constant source of speculation.

‘I probably only enjoyed about two months of last season,’ he said.

‘We were in the bottom three but then managed to put a few results together and jumped to 10th. But from 10th downwards last year everyone was in a relegation scrap and that’s not where we want to be this season. Hopefully (Allardyce staying) is done and dusted now.’

Pre-season has proved turbulent for the Hammers. They returned from Germany having failed to score against Schalke and Malaga. Loan signing Carl Jenkinson also suffered a hamstring injury.

This was after the trip to New Zealand where Andy Carroll damaged ankle ligaments, ruling him out until December, and the side suffered two defeats.

Noble said: ‘I’ve been through pre-seasons where we’ve battered everyone and then lost the first three. But you need a good start.

‘We’ve got two weeks to knuckle down and do what we need to do to become a proper team. Hopefully we can get another couple of signings in and enjoy this season.’

Allardyce came in for heavy criticism last season when West Ham fielded a weakened team in the FA Cup and lost 5-0 to Nottingham Forest.

But Noble says the Premier League remains the priority this time. ‘A cup run would be a bonus,’ he conceded. ‘For the club, what with the new stadium coming, the main concentration will be the league. We want to improve on 13th spot.’
