Orthopaedic surgeons in Scotland have said they will not be able to deliver the same standard of care in an independent Scotland and have attacked Alex Salmond’s ‘erroneous’ claims about the NHS.

The NHS has been at the centre of the independence debate, as Mr Salmond has repeatedly claimed the only way to stop it being privatised is for Scotland to break away from the UK.

But in an open letter sent to MailOnline, Scotland’s orthopaedic surgeons strongly dispute that claim and have criticised Mr Salmond for his misleading statements.

Alex Salmond has been accused of lying to voters about the threat of the NHS being privatised

85% of orthopedic surgeons have stated patient care would decline in an independent Scotland

Alarmingly, the vast majority also fear they would not be able to provide patients with the same level of care if Scotland breaks away from the rest of the UK.

The orthopaedic surgeons say in the letter: ‘We are concerned about the statements about privatisation of the NHS being used as an argument for voting ‘yes’.

‘We gather that there are still a number of people who may vote ‘yes’ because they feel they have to do so to save the Scottish NHS. 

‘As health is a completely devolved issue, this has allowed our health service to develop completely differently without interference from south of the border.’

In a poll of orthopedic surgeons from across the whole of Scotland, 95 per cent did not consider there was any risk of an increase in privatisation with a ‘no’ vote.

Yet, worryingly, 90 per cent considered they would struggle to recruit and retain the same quality of clinical staff if Scotland was independent.

Even more concerning was that more than 85 per cent felt they would not be able to deliver the same standard of care to their patients.

The letter, which is signed by a third of Scotland's 180 orthopedic surgeons, added: ‘The overwhelming majority of Scottish orthopedic surgeons therefore are seriously worried that they will not be able to provide their patients with the same standard of care with independence.

‘People must decide how to vote in the next 48 hours, but the reason for voting yes should not be to save the NHS and indeed there is grave concern in our community that this would be to the detriment of patient care.’

Hamish Simpson,  a Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery in Edinburgh, said: ‘The SNP say that you have got to vote ‘yes’ to save the NHS, but that seems to be entirely erroneous as health is a devolved issue.

‘What’s so frustrating is that anything is being said to try and win the referendum, as if this was a standard election, yet this is far more than the selection of a political party for four or five years.’

It was leaked by senior NHS staff furious with claims from Yes campaigners that the NHS is under threat if Scotland votes No.

Earlier this month, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown threatened to stand for election to the Scottish Parliament over Alex Salmond’s ‘lies’ about the NHS.

The former Prime Minister said he would make a dramatic return to frontline politics north of the border to tackle the SNP head on.

Mr Brown said: ‘The nationalists want you to believe that if an English Prime Minister sought to privatise the NHS in Scotland or cut its budget, Scots would be powerless to prevent this from happening.

Scotland's health service will be at more risk of cuts in spending if Scots vote to leave the union, an independent report found.

Figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed Scotland has been cutting health spending while there has been increases in funding in England.

Edinburgh plans to cut NHS funding by 1.2 per cent next year compared to five years ago, the report found, while England is due to increase health spending by 4.4 per cent.

As health spending is already devolved, the reports suggest the Scottish government has placed 'less priority' on funding the NHS than Westminster.

It added: 'The Scottish government has chosen to protect the NHS in Scotland slightly less than it has been protected in England.'

Paul Johnson, IFS director, said it was hard to see how an independent Scotland could spend more on the NHS than it could in a union where it will have significant tax raising powers.

In the longer term, the fall in oil revenues and an ageing population could make for a tougher fiscal outlook for Scotland than the rest of the UK.

‘They want you to believe that the Scottish Parliament is powerless to act to safeguard our NHS.

‘They want you to conclude that separation is the only answer if you care about the NHS. This is a nationalist deception – a claim that does not stand up to the evidence and that is not supported by the facts.

‘What the nationalists don’t tell you is that the Scottish health service cannot be privatised by Westminster because all decisions about our NHS are made here in Scotland. The Scottish Parliament, created by Labour in 1998, has full control over our health service.

Elsewhere last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband claimed that an independent Scotland would have to cut the NHS by the equivalent of 36,000 nurses due to the necessity of swingeing austerity.

He urged Scottish voters not to risk the future of the health service by taking a leap into the unknown - saying that thousands depend on English hospitals for 'life-saving treatment'.

His pitch came after 200 NHS workers, including respected doctors, wrote an open letter arguing that the service can 'ill afford the cuts' which would result in the event of a Yes vote on Thursday.

In the letter, employees of NHS Scotland - including academics, GPs, consultants, porters, dentists, staff nurses, medical secretaries, pharmacists and trainees - spoke out against independence.

They wrote: ‘We love our NHS and believe that working for it, as we all do or have done, is both a privilege and an act of service to our fellow citizens.

'We are living through tough financial times and can ill afford the additional cuts that would surely come should Scotland choose the risk of independence ahead of the broad shoulders of the UK.

'Patients from Scotland can access the care they need anywhere in the UK. Independence would, at best, put them at the back of the queue and specialties would need to be replicated here in Scotland at huge additional cost.'

Thumbs up: But a group of surgeons has denounced Salmond's plans for the NHS

Control over the NHS in Scotland is currently devolved to the Scottish government, led by Mr Salmond, and Westminster politicians are powerless to meddle with the service.

But the SNP points out that the UK government retains overall control of the public finances, and could therefore reduce the amount of money available to fund Scotland's public services.

They have said the ‘key gain’ a ‘yes’ vote will give them is ‘cast-iron protection’ against knock-on effects from ‘future Westminster cuts’.

Alex Neil, the health secretary in the Holyrood parliament, recently told MSPs: ‘The consequences of a no vote would be reduced budgets as a result of privatisation, patient charges, fragmented pay arrangements for health staff, with further pay restrictions and austerity as a matter of ideology south of the border.’

We are concerned about the statements about privatisation of the NHS being used as an argument for voting ‘yes’. I gather that there are still a number of people who may vote ‘yes’ because they feel they have to do so to save the Scottish NHS.

As health is a completely devolved issue, this has allowed our health service to develop completely differently without interference from south of the border.

Despite orthopaedic surgery often being the first component of health to be privatised, 95% of a poll of orthopaedic surgeons from across the whole of Scotland did not consider there was any risk of an increase in privatisation with a ‘no’ vote. However worryingly 90% considered that we would have difficulty recruiting and retaining the same quality of clinical staff if Scotland was independent and of even greater anxiety was that over 85% were concerned that they would not be able to deliver the same level of care to their patients.

The overwhelming majority of Scottish orthopaedic surgeons therefore are seriously worried that they will not be able to provide their patients with the same standard of care with independence.

People must decide how to vote in the next 48 hours, but the reason for voting yes should not be to save the NHS and indeed there is grave concern in our community that this would be to the detriment of patient care.
