'My custom World Championship red Timberlands! Thank you @tre_chic_living for this great gift!' Hamilton wrote.

Hamilton won the championship by 67 points after earning a double-points victory in Abu Dhabi, the race dubbed the 'Duel in the Desert'.

The 29-year-old beat team-mate Nico Rosberg to motor racing's top prize at the season's climax with The German still in with a chance of claiming the title himself.

The Mercedes duo endured a frosty relationship for much of the season as they battled on their own in the race for the title, culminating in a collision at the Belgian GP.
