Luis Suarez will play for Barcelona on Thursday afternoon in a training match specifically arranged to boost the striker's fitness.

The Uruguayan has been serving a four-month ban for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup and is not eligible to make his debut until the first El Clasico of the season on October 26.

But having paid £75million to sign the 27-year-old from Liverpool, new manager Luis Enrique is keen for his marquee signing to hit the ground running and has arranged a fixture against Barcelona B.

According to reports in Spain, Suarez will play alongside his team-mates who have not been called up for international duty.

Suarez made a brief appearance against Leon in last month's Joan Gamper Trophy, but the international break will provide Enrique with another opportunity to monitor the fitness of his controversial striker.

Earlier this week, Barcelona reaffirmed their stance that they paid £65m - not £75m - for the frontman.

The club's Sporting director, Andoni Zubizarreta, gave a statement on how much they’d spent this summer in a bid to show ‘transparency’.

The La Liga giants revealed their overall net spend this summer in an act of transparency they hope will alleviate any ongoing financial problems with UEFA.

Zubizarreta said on Tuesday: ‘We are speaking to you in order to communicate transparency. We know we are the only club in the world that is like this, but we want to observe the clarity that makes us so unique.’
