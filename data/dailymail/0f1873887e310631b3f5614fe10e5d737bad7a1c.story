Anger: Alison Huggan, 49, took Middlesbrough Council to a tribunal after they asked her to pay the spare room subsidy for her twin sons

A mother of two British soldiers has overturned a decision by her council who said she would have to pay 'bedroom tax' while her sons lived in barracks.

Alison Huggan, 49, from Coulby Newham in Middlesbrough, was told she 
was liable to pay a spare room subsidy, because the local authority said her twin sons' home was on their base.

Anas is a member of the Yorkshire Regiment First Battalion while Aaron is in the 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

The row broke out after the council said 
that Ms Huggan would be liable to pay £25 a week for her sons' rooms, 
despite the Government announcing last March that families with children in the armed forces would be exempt.

But Ms Huggan disagreed and, threatened by the prospect of losing £1,000 a year, took the council to tribunal.

She won her case along with a refund of around £700, a decision which could open the floodgates to other military families affected by the reforms.

Ms Huggan said: 'It was overwhelming seeing the decision in writing although I was very confident going in.'

Miss Huggan, who started fighting against the scheme in November 2012, said: 'We challenged the Government and we were overwhelmed in April when they said the armed forces were exempt.

'But then I hit another brick wall.

'In my head it was morally wrong. I couldn't believe that the Government would announce that the armed forces would be exempt when in effect they were not.

'When I read the amendment myself it was as plain as the nose on my face that we should be exempt.'

Despite winning her case, Ms Huggan has now chosen to move into a smaller home as Anas has just got married.

Victory: The mother of the two soldiers took her case to a tribunal and won. She was also handed a £700 refund

The Teesside University criminology graduate said: 'I'm happy I've won. I am moving to a smaller property but I wanted to carry this through.

'It was not just about me but other families too.'

Mrs Huggan is one of the tens of thousands of tenants wrongly hit by the reforms.

She confronted the Prime Minister with her plight in February last year and Labour leader Ed Miliband said the first decision was 'unfair'.

Tragic case: The parents of Becky Bell (pictured) were told they would have to pay more than £600 a year to keep her room untouched after she died of cancer in January 2012

In April 2013 the so-called 'bedroom tax' was introduced, reducing the amount of housing benefits people can receive if they have a spare room.

It saw social housing tenants with an extra room docked an average of £14 a week in benefits.

Around 660,000 lost some of their housing benefit from the change, which the Government said would save £465million a year.

Under the guidelines two children under 16 of same gender are expected to share while two children under 10 expected to share regardless of their gender.

Foster carers are allowed an additional room so long as they have fostered a child.

The rules also state the adult children in the Armed Forces should be treated as continuing to live at home when deployed on operations.

The charge was aimed at reducing over-crowding in social housing and directing benefits towards those who are most in need.

It impacted separated parents who shared the care of their children and parents whose children visit but are not part of the household.

The reforms have tipped nearly one in three affected council tenants into rent arrears and many have faced eviction because they cannot afford to pay.

Since the reform was introduced in, 50,000 households in 114 local council areas can no longer afford to pay for their accommodation.

Government rules decree a child aged under 16 in a home receiving housing benefit has to share a room with a sibling of the same gender.

Last year, the parents of a young cancer victim were told they would have to pay more than £650 a year to keep her untouched bedroom when charges for under-occupied homes came into force.

The ashes of seven-year-old Becky Bell were been kept in her bedroom at the family home in Hartlepool, which was left exactly as it was 
when she lost her battle with brain cancer in January 2012.
