Students were offered ‘bribes’ of up to £1,000 for their university society if they attended a rally against the Coalition’s spending cuts.

Groups such as archaeologists and ballroom dancers were told they needed to send members to tomorrow’s march in London to be eligible for extra funding.

The demand – circulated by the Manchester University’s Students’ Union – was branded an unacceptable misuse of public money.

It provoked a storm of protest across the campus before being withdrawn with a grovelling apology.

But the move is likely to call into 
question the motivation of some of the 10,000 marchers who the National 
Union of Students claims will take part in tomorrow’s rally.

It will be the first time students have marched in London against funding cuts since a series of rallies in 2010.

Email: Tommy Fish, activities officer at Manchester University (pictured) Students' Union, emailed all the societies it funds informing them that if they wanted extra cash they needed to support the march

During one, the building housing the 
Conservative Party’s headquarters was stormed, while later a car 
carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall was jostled and 
struck with missiles.

Last week Tommy Fish, a Spanish 
graduate serving as activities officer at Manchester University 
Students’ Union, emailed all the societies it funds informing them that 
if they wanted extra cash they needed to support the march.

‘In order to be sure of silver or gold
award, societies will need to send ten members to buy tickets and thus 
show support for the national student movement,’ he wrote.

Currently, the students’ union – 
itself largely funded by a £1.4million annual grant from the university –
gives societies a basic ‘bronze’ award worth £300 a year.

The figure rises to £600 for those 
that fulfil the criteria to attain a ‘silver’ award and up to £1,000 for
those that receive a ‘gold’ award.

Societies also include clubs for hikers, pole-dancing, knitting, and model aircraft enthusiasts.

One student, Andrew Williams, 
attracted 500 signatures to a petition accusing the students’ union of 
‘holding societies to ransom by using funding as a coercive tool to 
force societies to adopt particular political agendas that their members
may or may not agree with’.

The following day Mr Fish sent another
email offering a ‘sincere and unreserved apology’ and claiming the 
policy had been ‘merely a written error’.

But the students’ union’s general 
secretary, Nick Pringle, said it would continue to favour societies 
which backed ‘core union activities’ such as the rally.

John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, said: ‘It’s unacceptable for student unions to dictate what 
position a particular university society should take on spending cuts, 
and especially so on the threat of withdrawing funds.

‘Student leaders are stewards of taxpayers’ money and to be so overtly political in distributing it is deeply worrying.’
