They may have been searching in a galaxy far far away, but more pressing concerns here on Earth saw America's search for life on other planets grind to a halt earlier this week.

Wildfires raging in Northern California briefly halted the search for extraterrestrial life on Tuesday.

The Eiler Fire, burning some 200 miles north of Sacramento, forced employees at the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array to evacuate and temporarily shut down all of their computers, Internet and power.

Life, but not as we know it: A wildfire that has consumed more than 31,000 acres in northern California forced the temporary evacuation of a telescope facility used to monitor the skies for extraterrestrial life

The fire came within a mile of the SETI Institute's Allen Telescope Array in Hat Creek on Tuesday, forcing staffers 'to evacuate and temporarily shut down all of their computers, Internet, and power' for several hours.

'We can't listen when all that is down,' said Seth Shostak, senior astronomer and director of SETI Research to CNN.

At SETI -- which stands for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence -- scientists search the heavens for signs of extraterrestrial life by 'listening' with an array of small satellite dishes.

The blaze came within a mile of the facility, located near Hat Creek, California, on both the east and west sides.

'The fire on the west had jumped the road, burnt down our favorite lunch place, got within a mile of the telescopes,' he said.

Pat Heitkam and his wife, Laura, survey the damage Wednesday, Aug. 6, 2014, at their home in Hat Creek, California., off Highway 89. 'This place was really beautiful, and meant a lot to a whole lot of people,' Pat Heitkam said

Firefighters try to stop the spreading of the Eiler Fire from moving closer to Burney. Thunderstorms that brought light rain and increased humidity to Northern California helped crews make progress

The Allen Telescope Array, funded by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, includes 42 antennas designed to listen for extraterrestrial activity 'at centimeter wavelengths.'

Despite the shutdown, Shostak downplayed the possibility that researchers had missed an E.T. discovery.

'We just lost some search hours,' he said. 'To expect that E.T. will somehow reach out at this moment, that would be very bizarre.'

As the flames got closer, the staff fled to safer ground and shut down the satellites.

We're listening: On a good day, this is how the telescope array normally appears

Tracy Porter, of Paradise, Calif., uses an axe to fragment a burning tree damaged by the Eiler Fire. Firefighters were focusing on two wildfires near each other in Northern California that have burned through more than 100 square miles of terrain

The Eiler Fire has burned more than 31,000 acres and threatened over 700 homes.

Officials say the fire is 35% contained and is expected to be fully contained by August 20th.

Fire officials are hopeful that wet weather and increased humidity in the region will help to control the blaze.

The scientists were eventually given the all clear to return to the facility and the search for life is once again continuing.
