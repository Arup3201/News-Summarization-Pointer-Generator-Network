Contrary to reports earlier this season that Barcelona players - and particularly Lionel Messi - were unhappy with head coach Luis Enrique, midfielder Ivan Rakitic has thrown his backing behind his boss, and says the rest of the Barca squad rate him, too.

A tough start to the season in La Liga that saw Barca fall away from league leaders Real Madrid had Enrique under pressure within weeks of taking the job, but a brilliant turnaround in form seems to have swung things in his favour.

Enrique's charges are now just two points behind Real after clawing back the lead with a run that has seen them drop just eight points from their last 15 league games, and look well set for the Champions League quarter-finals after their 2-1 first leg win away at Manchester City. 

Ivan Rakitic says Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique has the backing of his players, who see him as the boss

Enrique was under pressure earlier this season and was said to have a difficult relationship with some players

And that transformation looks to have been helped by the attitude of his players who, according to summer signing Rakitic, are all behind their boss.

'(Luis Enrique) is the boss and he knows what is best,' the Croatian told Sportske Novosti. 'We all believe in him.

'Our success is in the collective act of all for one and one for all.'

The victory helped to close the gap on Real Madrid and Barca are now in with a shout of silverware

Enrique knows what's best, according to Rakitic, who spoke of the collective Barca group in an interview

Rakitic scored Barca's opener in their 3-1 win over Granada on Saturday to close the gap on Real, who could only draw with Villarreal, but the midfielder says he is making no time to think about the fortunes of the current leaders.

'Today, Real are ahead but the road is a long one,' Rakitic said. 'We just think about ourselves, as there is no need to think about Real.

'We believe that everything is possible.'

Lionel Messi later scored in the 3-1 win over Granada to bring Barcelona to 59 points, just two behind Real
