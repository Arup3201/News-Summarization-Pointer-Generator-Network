He was known for his charitable work throughout his life.

And now it has emerged that Sir Jimmy Savile has left most of his £4.3million fortune to charity.

Details of his will have emerged, showing that Sir Jimmy, who  died aged 84 in October, left more than £3.6million for a trust to continue his work.

He did, however, leave some of his precious belongings to members of his family.

Sir Jimmy’s nephew Roger Foster, 67, 
has been given the gold rings the star inherited from his parents. A 
black and white photo of him with the Beatles was left to niece Mandy 
McKenna.

They and six others will also benefit
from a share of £600,000. Sir Jimmy, who never married, left another 18
people £1,000 each.

The star died aged 84 last October at his home in Roundhay, Leeds.

During his lifetime, the star – who 
rose to fame presenting Top Of The Pops in the 1960s – raised more than 
£40million for charity.

In particular, he did a lot of fundraising for Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire and Leeds General Infirmary.

He also sponsored medical  students at Leeds University, giving £100,000 a year by the time of his death.

In addition, Sir Jimmy was known for supporting charities by running marathons – he completed the London race aged 79.

His devotion to charitable works earned him a knighthood in 1990.

The Jim’ll Fix It host died after suffering pneumonia.

Following his death, Sir Jimmy’s family said they expected very little would be left to
them. They said his motto was: ‘You get what you work for’ – and he 
preferred to give his wealth to good causes than dish it out to family.

Sir Jimmy was buried in Scarborough in
November following three days of remembrance when his coffin was on 
display in the Leeds hotel; 5,000 people paid their respects.

He was laid to rest wearing one of his
trademark tracksuits and with three large cigars, and the coffin was 
angled at 45 degrees because he wanted to ‘see the sea’.

Giving a eulogy at the veteran DJ’s 
funeral in November, Professor Alistair Hall, a cardiologist, revealed a
hospital unit devoted to helping heart patients is to be created in 
Leeds using a bequest from Sir Jimmy Savile’s will.

The Savile Institute will help people with cardiovascular disease and pioneer research into heart disease.

Sir Jimmy was a hugely generous supporter and benefactor of charities at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals from the 1960s onwards.

The TV legend reportedly amassed a 
string of properties included a penthouse flat overlooking Roundhay Park
in Leeds, a picturesque cottage in Glencoe, Scotland, a flat in central
London, and a home in Bournemouth.

Sir Jimmy claimed to have set up the 
world's first disco in Leeds in 1948 before he moved into radio and 
rapidly acquired national fame, first with Radio Luxembourg and then 
with BBC Radio 1.

He later took part in the 1951 Tour of
Britain cycle race and became a professional wrestler. During his 
lifetime he ran a reported 212 marathonsSir Jimmy presented the very first
edition of Top Of The Pops in 1964 and appeared on the BBC show for 40 
years, presenting the last episode in 2006.

In the 1970s he started a 20-year run as host of BBC show Jim'll Fix It, making dreams come true for more than 1,500 children.

Sir Jimmy became famous for his 
tracksuits and shell suits and his catchphrases including 'How's about 
that, then?', 'Now then, now then, now then', 'Goodness gracious', and 
'Guys and gals'.

In December last year a divorcee emerged sensationally claiming to be the secret love child of Sir Jimmy Savile.

Georgina Ray, 40, says her mother had a
brief fling with the TV star – who never married - while working as a 
waitress in the 1970s. However she is understood to have told lawyers 
she was not ‘after any money’.
