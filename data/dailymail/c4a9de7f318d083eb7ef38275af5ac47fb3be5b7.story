England have lifted the Ashes but were today denied the chance to make history when the umpires chose to stop play due to bad light.

In a decision that followed procedure to the letter but baffled players and fans, England's fearless attempt to catch up with Australia was cut short with the game minutes away from a thrilling climax.

With England needing just 21 more runs 
in four overs to seal their first-ever 4-0
Ashes victory, umpires Aleem Dar and Kumar Dharmasena were booed by a 
capacity Oval crowd when they took the players off as the light closed 
in at 7.36pm.

Victory: England may not have won the battle, but the home side won the war in this controversial series

Euphoric: Player Kevin Pieterson thrusts the urn as he celebrates England's win with fans at the Oval

Thrilling: Cricketer Graeme Swann lifts his son Wilfred as he celebrates England's win after a frustrating end to the day's paly

Leader: Captain Alastair cook reaches out to fans who booed the umpires decision to cut play short

Fading: As the sky darkened and the floodlights were switched on at the Oval, the umpires began to assess how long play could last

Stand back: Umpire Aleem Dar pushes Australian captain Michael away as the officials check their light meters and make the controversial call

It didn't stop them! A game of cricket between Bamburgh and Manderston in Northumberland showed no signs of stoppng despite dense fog and fading light

Outraged fans booed the abrupt decision, which made for an ill-fitting end to a triumphant series win for Alastair Cook's side.

Commentators have criticised the decision to end proceedings, saying it sums up how the sport's pedantic laws hamper the game.

Had
things been allowed to play out to the end, England were strong 
favourites to claim a 4-0 home Ashes win for the first time ever and 
give Clarke the dubious honour of being only the third captain - after 
Sir Garfield Sobers (1968) and Graeme Smith (2006) - to lose a Test 
having declared twice.

Amid
the frustration, it should not be overlooked that a draw leaves 
Australia without a win in an Ashes series for the first time since 
1977.

England captain Alastair Cook said winning the Ashes series as the 'proudest moment of my life'.

Record breaker: Brad Haddin salutes the crowd after his 29th dismissal of the series - the highest ever in a series by a wicket keeper

Useful: Matt Prior hits out after a useful 47 gave England a chance at winning the match

Just short: Ian Bell's 45 meant he was five runs short of recording at least a half century in every test in this series

'It
would have been nice to finish with a win but the rules and regulations
are there for a reason,' Cook said at the presentation ceremony after 
lifting the famous urn while red and white fireworks erupted around the 
ground to celebrate England's third Ashes win in a row.

'The umpires have strict guidelines and, if it was day three, we would have gone off.

'This
morning our job was to try and make it as difficult as possible to stop
Australia from pushing on for a win and to make our chances of victory 
easier.

'The crowds have 
been fantastic for all five tests and I'm privileged to captain this 
group of guys. Winning this series is the proudest moment of my life.'

For the whole of 
this match England had crawled along towards the most pragmatic of draws
but they rose to the challenge in the most spectacular 
way to thrillingly march towards that unprecedented English 4-0 Ashes 
success.

Fired up: Broad celebrates taking the wicket of Ryan Harris

Having a go: England needed 224 from the final sessions to win the match

Jovial: England fans enjoying the final days play before light begins to fade and the tone of the event changes drastically

The consolation 
for the frustrated crowd was that they could not have possibly imagined 
that they would see anything other than a low-key finale to this Ashes 
series when they made their way through soggy London yesterday.

The run chase which saw England move towards their target of 227 in 44 overs would not have been 
possible had Clarke not thrown down the gauntlet with a declaration that gave his 
side little chance of victory.

Australia
have spent the whole of this Test trying to rewrite history, goading 
England over their perceived timidity and ignoring the fact they were 
3-0 down in an attempt to gain the morale high ground ahead of 
Novemberâ€™s return.

Highest total: England's 377 in the first innings was the highest score they've set during this Ashes series

Dejection: Australia captain Michael Clarke looks on as England rack up their total

Skittled: Broad scattered Ryan Harris' stumps

Token: Clarke was the only one to offer any resistance to Broad's brilliance, the captain scoring 28 not out

Jubilant: England fans can't believe what they are seeing as Australia's batsmen fell apart
