The triple-breasted woman who first hit headlines last September after claiming to have paid $20,000 to surgically add a third boob has been spotted walking four half-naked men down a street.

Jasmine Tridevil - whose real name is Alisha Hessler - has been filmed walking down a busy road in what has become her trademark three-cup bikini.

A passer-by was parked in a petrol station when they noticed the 21-year-old strolling past with four humans wearing gimp masks on dog leads.

Jasmine Tridevil - a.k.a Alisha Hessler - revealed her third boob in September. The 21-year-old from Florida then laid low after it was revealed the breast was a fake. But she has now been spotted walking four half-naked men down a street on leads

The half-naked men are crawling along the pavement on all-fours, with their identities concealed by black fetish hoods.

Alisha has yet to confirm that the video is of her, but she passes more than a striking resemblance to the woman in the clip, which was recently uploaded to YouTube. 

The man filming says: 'It's a girl, looks like a girl with long hair. She has three t**s!'

When he asks the woman if her dogs bite, she replies: 'They're my Shih Tzus.'

Alisha has yet to confirm that the video is of her, but she passes more than a striking resemblance to the woman in the clip 

She then shouts directions to her 'dogs' on where to crawl that include: 'To the right boys.'

Alisha, who comes from Tampa, Florida, first revealed her third breast to the world in September with the aim of becoming a reality television star. 

She claimed that she was was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure. 

In the US, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity' under ethical codes outlined by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. 

But Alisha insisted that she was able to enlist the help of a surgeon surgeon to carry out the unusual operation on the grounds that she kept their name a secret.

She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements.

The massage therapist,then shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom-made bikinis on her Facebook fan page. 

But just a couple of weeks later, a Florida news station alleged that the third breast was sham after a luggage theft report lodged at Tampa International Airport mentioned a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis'.

The name on the missing luggage report was Alisha Hessler - the same name that Jasmine Tridevil's website was registered to.

Alisha later called in to a local radio station to deny the allegations of a fake boob and insisted that she had undergone surgery. 

Alisha has a history of S&M with young men - in September, an 18-year-old called Micheal Squier told The Sun that the massage therapist had kept him as a caged sex slave after meeting her on Facebook.

He alleged that he was tied up, tortured, forced to sleep in a dog's cage and made to wear a dog's collar at her home in Tampa. 

He told the paper: 'She is completely psychotic. She turned me into a slave, beat me and humiliated me. 

'I am physically scarred for life and live with the shame of what she did to me.

'On the night we met she tied me up and flogged me against a post. She then got me really drunk and said she wanted to cut me.'
