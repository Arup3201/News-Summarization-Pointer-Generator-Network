One family came up with a pretty novel method of finding their way out of a corn maze, but they're unlikely to be trying it again anytime soon.

The couple with a three-week-old baby who entered the maze in Danvers, Massachusetts, ended up calling 911 for a rescue after they got lost.

A policeman and dog unit were dispatched to help the family, who became worried when it began to get dark in the seven-acre Connors Farm maze.

‘We came in during the day time and we got completely lost and we have no idea where we are,’ the woman told a 911 operator on Monday evening.

‘We thought this would be fun. Instead, it’s a nightmare.’

Authorities found the couple by the end of a seven-minute call - by which time it was reportedly around an hour after closing time.

The family were only 25ft from the exit of the maze - which has been open to visitors for around five years - when they were located, reported ABC.

‘They were in the heart of the maze,’ farm owner Bob Connor told ABC. ‘Hanging out by bridge, right in the centre of the horse.’

Lost woman

Mr Connor said they were the first family to get stuck in the maze this year - and the farm will put a mark at the point where they got lost.

‘We designed the maze for people to get lost but it’s all about family fun and it’s unfortunate that the family got stuck,’ Mr Connor told ABC.

Farm staff don’t leave the site until every visitor has found their way out, he said. The couple paid around $15 to walk through the maze.

Challenging: Utah-based company the Maize designed the Connors Farm maze and a spokesman said it takes the average person 45 minutes to get out

Utah-based company the Maize designed the Connors Farm maze and a spokesman said it takes the average person 45 minutes to get out.

But marketing director Kamille Combs told the Los Angeles Times she had never heard of police rescuing someone from a corn maze.

The family unsurprisingly declined an offer from farm management of free tickets to have another go at getting through the maze, reported ABC.
