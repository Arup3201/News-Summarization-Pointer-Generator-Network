Accused: Vladimir Antonov, former chairman of Portsmouth FC and former director of Snoras Bankis accused of being the main mover in an 'asset-stripping' fraud that crippled the bank

Ex Pompey chairman Vladimir Antonov was the 'prime mover and shaker' behind a 'colossal' €500million fraud which forced the bank he controlled to be nationalised, a court has heard.

Antonov, 37, and business partner Raimondas Baranauskas, 55, are fighting attempts to extradite them to Lithuania where they are accused of asset stripping at Snoras Bank.

London-based Antonov and Lithuanian Baranauskas, both major shareholders in the bank, are accused of 
stealing €470million (£396million) in assets and $10million (£6million) cash and squirrelling it away in a network of 
foreign bank accounts.

They tried to cover their tracks by 
forging documents which they gave to the country’s central bank to give 
the impression Snoras 'had its head above water,' the court heard.

But
the company was left a shell of its former self and had to be 
nationalised after the audacious fraud, which spanned three years from 
August 2008 to June 2011.

If the pair, both former directors of the bank, are found guilty of the fraud in they face a substantial prison sentence.

John
Hardy QC, appearing for the Lithuanian government, told Westminster 
Magistrates' Court: 'The case itself is very simple. These two gentleman 
were shareholders in, and held senior managerial positions in Snoras 
Bank.

'The long and short of the case is that between 2008 and 2011 they asset stripped the bank.

'Mr
Antonov was, we will see, the primary mover, Mr Baranauskas profited to
a lesser extent, but both these gentleman had bank accounts in a Swiss 
bank which has branches in Germany and Zurich.

'Over
the course of the period, securities and cash funds were transferred 
from Snoras’ accounts, either owned or at least controlled and managed 
by both these gentleman, in vast quantities.

'The core of this case are those unlawful transfers which are known here simply as theft.'

He
added: 'There are 33 transfers of either cash funds or securities from 
accounts in the name of Snoras bank to accounts owned, managed or 
controlled by Mr Antonov or Mr Baranauskas.

'They
stole a colossal amount of money and forged documents purporting to 
show that the money had not left Snoras accounts, and gave those 
documents to the central bank to give the impression that Snoras had its
head above the water.

'But in fact as a result of the actions of these gentleman it was below the water.'

Both men deny the allegations, which they claim are part of a political 'conspiracy on the part of the Lithuanian authorities and central bank'.

But this was dismissed by Mr Hardy who said it is in fact a 'straight forward and massive case of alleged fraud of a major bank'.

He said: 'On or about 22 June 2011 Mr Antonov became de facto chairman of Portsmouth Football Club. He resigned from that position on 29 November.

'You may remember, and this is not to be held against Mr Antonov in any way, but Portsmouth Football Club is a basket case economy.

'But when Mr Antonov resigned he cited from the government in Lithuania. We say that in reality this is a legitimate form of interference if ever there was one.'

Snoras
bank employed more than 2,300 people across 250 branches with more than
one million customers before it was nationalised in 2011, the court was
told.

The bank owned a 34 
per cent stake in the Lithuania Morning newspaper, the country's best-seller which was part of a media group which also owned a television channel and news website.

Antonov and Baranauskas, who are both 
fighting extradition, are each accused of five offences of fraud and 
theft and are on conditional bail.

Their full extradition hearing before District Judge John Zani is expected to last nearly two weeks.

James
Lewis QC, defending Antonov, told the court his client would not 
receive a fair trial in Lithuania and the European arrest warrants had 
been issued for 'political reasons'.

'The pressure is on the Lithuanian authorities to secure a conviction,' he said.

'That
pressure is so great it will not be resisted. The current government of
Lithuania want to remove Mr Antonov for political reasons.'

Mr
Lewis said there was an 'anti-Russian sentiment' in Lithuania which had
not been dispelled by the country’s current Conservative government.

The Lithuania Morning had run a story from WikiLeaks cables 
revealing the Lithuanian government's concerns about Russian influence 
in the former Soviet state's mass media, Mr Lewis said.

Mr Lewis told the court that politicians in Lithuania 'consistently exploited' a feeling of hostility towards Russian influence.

'One certainly sees the will there to replace political opponents in the media,' he said.

An investigation commission in Lithuania - which has similar powers to a British parliamentary select committee - looked into the nationalisation of Snoras bank and found 'no evidence of a decrease in assets,' Mr Lewis said.

'The allegation against Mr Antonov and Mr Baranauskas is they stole securities,' he said.

'You will hear, and it is the case, that they were transferred from an Austrian bank to a Swiss bank and these securities were still in control of Snoras bank. No one said they are gone or they have disappeared.'

Both men sat at the back of court in smart suits as the case against them was outlined. They both deny any dishonesty.

The extradition hearing, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.
