A 20-year-old who was kicked out by his religious parents after he came out as gay has received almost $50,000 in donations to help him start a new life.

Daniel Ashley Pierce, from Kennesaw, Georgia, secretly filmed the moment he was disowned by his family and the YouTube video has attracted almost two million views in two days.

The five-minute clip titled 'How not to react when your child tells you that he's gay' has prompted hundreds of supportive responses on YouTube and donations have been pouring in.

In the video a woman, believed to be his mother, is heard saying: 'I have known that you were gay since you were a tiny boy.

'You have made a choice from what you've told your daddy. You can deny all you want to but I believe in the word of God and he does not create anybody that way.'

Mr Pierce responds saying that he was born this way and has not made a choice, but his family does not back down.

He tells his family he believes that 'scientific proof trumps the word of God'.

But his mother responds saying: 'You will need to move out and find whenever you can to live. Because I will not let anyone believe that I condone what you want to do.

'You told me on the phone that you made that choice. You know you wasn't born that way. You know good and well you made that choice.

'You know that your father has done everything he can to raise you. He didn't need to blame himself.'

Mr Pierce then asks his mother if he can stay in the house, but she refuses and the argument becomes more heated.

His boyfriend set up a GoFundMe page to help Mr Pierce with living expenses after he was kicked out.

It raised $48,808 in one day from 1,819 people donating.

He said: 'I didn't realise that this was even set up for me. I don't even know how to thank y'all. 

'I wish I could give each and everyone of you a huge hug. I was trying to respond to everyone but I couldn't keep up. Thank you.'

Roberta Randazzo commented on the page saying: 'Be proud of yourself, it takes a lot of courage to do a thing like that.

'I lived in a hell like that for five years and I can completely understand you, go on with you own life and don't let them break your dreams.'

Rebecca Hall said: 'I'm sorry for how your parents treated you. You are not a disgrace. Your family are the disgrace. 

'I would never treat my child the way you have been treated. My mother is Christian and when my brother 'came out' she accepted it with love and told him that his actions and sexuality are between him and God. 

'It is both sad and inspiring that strangers have shown more love and support than your own family.'
