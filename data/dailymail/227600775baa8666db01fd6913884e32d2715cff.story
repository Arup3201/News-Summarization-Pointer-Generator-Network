He thought he had done it, last kick of the game. Gareth Bale saw the opening on the right and let fly, Beto, in Sevilla’s goal flung himself acrobatically to save. Bale scrambled to secure the loose ball in vain, referee Mark Clattenburg blew the final whistle.

What a homecoming it might have been, what a finale. Instead, in his native Wales on Tuesday night, Bale had to settle for a win, the first trophy of Real Madrid’s season and not the crowning glory he and the locals surely craved.

Still, he will no doubt have reflected as

team-mates beneath a triumphant arch declaring them UEFA Super Cup 
winners, it could be worse.

Not every wish can come true for a Galactico; just most of them.

So it was that Cristiano Ronaldo stole the show in Cardiff. Bale’s show, James Rodriguez’s show, Toni Kroos’s show. The new wave had to bow down to the master. But those who turned out to see the World Footballer of the Year, as much as the local hero, will not have gone home disappointed.

Ronaldo cut a forlorn figure in Brazil this summer. Injured, shorn of his more talented club-mates, his Portugal team failed to make it out of their group and the talisman appeared pitiably morose.

This occasion could not have been more different. His two goals were well taken, the second a peach, and he looked fit, re-energised, every inch the planet’s finest footballer.

However impressive his companions, it 
is Ronaldo who encapsulates the brilliance of the European champions, 
his daring, his audacity, his vision. Cardiff was privileged to have him
 for the night; as any city would be.

Although
 maybe not Seville. His two goals here took his total against Sevilla to
 18 in four years. It is a typical Ronaldo trait that some of his 
numbers induce gasps. The majority of forwards would be happy with that 
return in one season; he has achieved it against one club.

Yet Ronaldo’s magnificence should not 
detract from Bale’s  contribution. He certainly did not have a poor game
 and his cross for Ronaldo’s opener was arguably the pass of the night. 
With all eyes on the new boys, it was last season’s partnership that 
combined to break the stalemate with a stunning counter-attack fully 
showcasing the incredible threat posed by Madrid on the break.

Sevilla
 lost the ball 70 yards from their own net but, in the blink of an eye, 
that is where it had been relocated, a quite superb left-wing cross by 
Bale finding Ronaldo at the far post for a simple, if impressively 
clinical, finish.

Switching ably between flanks and through the middle, Bale’s supply line was inch-perfect.

Less
 grand than the Bernabeu, this was nonetheless a fitting stage for his 
talents. Born and raised in this city — Southampton spotted him as a 
nine-year-old playing for Cardiff Civil Service and, at 16, he was still
 helping his school win trophies locally — what a player he has grown up
 to be.

He looks entirely at home in this company, no matter the continued raising of the stakes.

Will it work, this team of all the talents? It presents no easy challenge for coach Carlo Ancelotti.

Madrid’s
 squad is like a big family now, with all the kids constantly fighting 
for attention. So James Rodriguez had a fine second-half shot saved by 
Beto and Karim Benzema had a couple go close. Angel Di Maria — who may 
just have been Madrid’s most consistent player over the course of last 
season — couldn’t even get in the starting line-up.

As
 for Bale, he had a couple of first-half shots deflect wide and forced 
an 18th-minute save from Beto: close but no cigar. Perhaps he was just 
trying too hard.

He took a free-kick which did not make
 it over the wall and could not get on the end of any crosses, despite a
 number of a good penalty area runs. Nor was he greatly helped by his 
re-acquaintance with Clattenburg.

When
 Bale was fouled quite blatantly early in the game, Clattenburg waved 
play on, perhaps leaning too heavily on memory and accusations of 
diving. They tend to take Bale only on face value in Spain and he fits 
right in.

Ronaldo is another
 who is more sinned against than sinning.  Preparing for one of his 
lightning stepovers in the first half, he was taken out quite brutally 
by Sevilla’s Vitolo, whose response was almost comical in its crudeness.

The second goal, which effectively ended the contest, was a perfect riposte four minutes after half time.

If at first you don't succeed: Bale kept trying but his performance did not match Ronaldo's

Ronaldo
 started the move on the halfway line and finished it, seizing a square 
pass from Benzema to strike a left-foot shot that eluded Beto. Maybe the
 Sevilla goalkeeper should have done better, but  Ronaldo’s effect on 
the ball has a way of bamboozling even the safest of hands.

There
 are a number of useful teams around now, but few possess a forward line
 capable of the  wonder of Madrid. When Ancelotti named a front six of 
Ronaldo, Bale, James, Kroos, Luka Modric and Benzema, it was a statement
 of intent, a bold return to the days of the Galacticos when the club 
attempted to dominate Europe with an XI that read like a spectacularly 
overambitious fantasy team.

On
 the computer screen the group does not have to gel, blend or strike 
that delicate balance between attacking genius and defensive resilience.
 Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard were always a wonderful pairing, if 
matched by keyboard or console.

Kroos control: The German midfielder was at his controlling best in his competitive Madrid debut

Real
 football isn’t like that, except Real’s football is. There is no 
equivalent of Claude Makelele in this team, no deep midfield destroyer.

Ancelotti’s
 forwards have to run hard and Modric and Kroos have to put in their 
tackles. It shouldn’t work, it may not work long term — but last night 
it did, just about.

This 
was one of those occasions when Madrid gave their opponents so much to 
deal with that the odd defensive lapse could be overlooked.

Beating
 the very best teams,  certainly in the late stages of the Champions 
League, may require a plan B. Yet in Cardiff, Madrid just kept coming at
 Sevilla until the defences broke. It was nevertheless a bold first-half
 performance by the Europa League champions and Iker Casillas made more 
first-half saves than his counterpart Beto.

But it always seemed a matter of when, not if, Madrid would score and that moment arrived bang on the half-hour.

This is a team that cannot, as yet, find room for Sami Khedira, Di Maria or Xabi Alonso.

Maybe
 one day they will abandon all semblance of logic and just send out the 
11 best players in the world. If they bought Manuel Neuer they could 
even take a swing at rush goalie. Don’t put it past them.

It is fair to say they do things differently over there, even if Ronaldo’s influence remains as reliable as Iberian sunrise.
