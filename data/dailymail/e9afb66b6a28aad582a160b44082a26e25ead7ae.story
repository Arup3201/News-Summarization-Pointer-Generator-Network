A professional skydiver has redefined 'extreme sports' after becoming the first person to complete five of the blood-pumping activities in just one day.

Chuck Berry, from Queenstown in New Zealand, managed to skydive, snowboard, mountain bike, bungee jump and take a ride in a jet boat in no more than an hour in July this year.

The 47-year-old told Daily Mail Australia that the whole experience left him feeling 'like James Bond'.

Chuck Berry, from Queenstown in New Zealand, skydived, snowboarded, mountain biked, bungee jumped and took a ride in a jet boat in one day 

It took the 47-year-old only one hour to complete all five activities 

'It was just wonderful. I'm an adventurer by trade so being able to combine all these sports is something I've always dreamt of doing,' he said.

'As far as I know, no one else has ever done it…I couldn't take the smile off my face for days afterwards.'

Mr Berry's extreme day was designed and planned right down to a tee.

It began with a helicopter ride to Mount Hyde in Queenstown near the Skippers Canyon where he skydived down onto the mountain peak in his snow boots from 10,000 feet in the air.

He landed just nearby his snowboard which he then rode down the mountain side

The professional extreme sportsman landed right beside his snowboard which he rode down the mountain, where he was again picked up in the same chopper.

He was then dropped off at Vanguard Peak where he mounted a bike that was attached to the side of the helicopter, and proceeded to mountain bike mostly downhill to the historic Skippers Bridge.

From here, Mr Berry bungee jumped off the edge of the 75 metre high bridge before being lowered down to a jet boat which took him on a thrilling ride down the river.

After a quick footwear change, he Mr Berry mounted a mountain bike attached to the side of the chopper and rode mostly downhill along an old mining trail 

'Skydiving is something I'm extra passionate about it and it's not every day that you get to land a parachute on top of a mountain, but the snowboarding was just delicious,' Mr Berry recounted.

'It was buttery, creamy snowboard conditions and that was just wonderful.

'But it was the jet boat ride at the end of it all, when I had the camera helicopter behind me, that was close to being the best part - that was really when I felt like Bond.'

Although he may have been the first person to conquer all five sports in one day, Mr Berry will certainly not be the last.

Tourism New Zealand and STA Travel are using the event to promote their first-of-its-kind new package, the 5X1NZ.

The deal allows adrenalin seekers to also accomplish all five of the sports in one day - all of which are located within a 50km radius of each other in Queenstown.

The package is being targeted towards mostly young travellers, 500,000 of whom explore New Zealand each year according to Andrew Fraser from Tourism New Zealand.
