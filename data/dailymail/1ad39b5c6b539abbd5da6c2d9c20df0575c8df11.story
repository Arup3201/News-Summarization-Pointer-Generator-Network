Jobless Benefits Street 'star' White Dee admitted she rakes in £200 a week in handouts and knows workers left with half as much money to live.

The 42-year-old single mother attacked the government for creating a claimant culture - and said it is not her fault how much she is given.

White Dee - real name Deirdre Kelly - also accused Channel 4 of manipulating the residents of James Turner Street, in Birmingham.

Anger: White Dee, from Channel 4's Benefits Street, appears on a live debate on Monday evening

The Benefits Street matriarch has been living off handouts after being sacked from her job as a council administrator seven years ago. She narrowly avoided prison after being caught stealing £13,000.

She claims she is unable to work because she is 'depressed' - but has faced accusations that she appears to be living it up on handouts.

After starring on television, she has been tipped to appear on Celebrity Big Brother and would be in line to receive a £60,000 appearance fee - which would mean the end of benefits.

White Dee said that she receives around £200 per week in handouts.

As a mother-of two she is entitled to £33.70 child benefit per week, a maximum of £106.50 in Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) payments because she is 'depressed', plus £115 per week child tax credits.

In order to get her ESA benefits for depression, White Dee will have been assessed by Atos workers who would have signed her off as unfit to work. During the process, she may have provided a GP's note confirming that she is sick.

During a live debate, hosted by Richard Bacon on Channel 4, she said the broadcaster had painted a distorted picture of life living on handouts.

'You (Channel 4) spent up to 18 months, up 
to two years, to film people that were working, you filmed old age 
pensioners, you came to parties, you filmed open days, community spirit 
and boom (you showed)... five of us.'

The single mother - who chewed gum during the live show - added that on-screen life on handouts was made to look like fun.

White Dee admitted that she receives 'about £200 per week' in state handouts to live off.

The money she receives consists of child tax credits, child benefit and Employment Support Allowance (ESA).

As a mother-of-two, she receives £20.30 per week for her first child 16-year-old Caitlin plus £13.40 for her second child Gerrard, aged seven.

She is also eligible to receive £5,995 per year in child tax credits - which works out as £115 per week.

Finally she receives ESA, which is paid to people who are sick. White Dee could receive up to £100.15 per week. However, this can be reduced if the individual does not attend support group sessions or interviews.

White Dee has insisted that depression means she cannot work - because she would be forced to take regular days off sick.

During a recent television interview on Channel 5, she said: 'I haven't been on benefits my whole life. At the moment I am not in a place where (I can work). I suffer with depression and I am being assessed for bipolar disorder.

'I have a good day, I have three bad days and then I have two good days. What sort of employer would I ring up and say "sorry I can't come in for three days - I'm low".

'I would prefer to be working.'

'It looks great, it looks like a right barrel of laughs. It looks like you are having a great crack,' she said.

'Obviously it is just a programme that they put together into 40 minutes that they had spent 18 months filming.'

Accusing the government of creating a claimant culture, she added: 
'I don't create the benefit system it's the government. They say how 
much I should get, how much you should get, how much child benefit.

'Not me - I don't go down to my local MP and say this is what I should get.

'The actual government is the one that sets the precedence for how much money I should get so it's not my fault.'

Benefits
 Street has been a massive rating success and White Dee said up to 150 
people per day have been knocking on her front door asking for 
autographs, photos and cups of tea.

The
 world's media has descended on James Turner Street, with journalists 
arriving from Germany, France, Russia, North Africa and Australia.

Channel 4 has been criticised for demonising those living 
on the breadline, while some of the residents claim they were misled 
into appearing.

White Dee 
added: 'I couldn't actually believe how big it had become and how much 
it had opened up a big can of worms, basically.'

Asked by Mr Bacon what reaction people had to her, the show's most recognisable face said it was '90 per cent positive'.

In
 a new documentary shown before the debate, White Dee told filmmakers 
that she receives ‘about £200’ a week in benefit payments.

White Dee took issue with the programme's portrayal of life for those on benefits, claiming it made it look like a 'right barrel of laughs'

She
 has admitted stealing £13,000 from her former employer, Birmingham City Council, in 2007 - and claimed in an article in The Spectator last week
 that she plans to run for Parliament.

She
 said: 'I am a single parent, I get child benefit, I get child tax 
credit and I get ESA (Employment and Support Allowance). I'm not raking 
in thousands.

'I probably 
get a weekly income of about £200. I know people that work there a****s 
off who haven't got half of that a week to live on. It is what p***** 
people off but it's not my fault unless I become an MP.'

Labour
 MP Chris Bryant, Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform, accused Channel 4 
of presenting a partial picture of life on the street.

'There are 99 houses in that street and you would expect 50 of them would be pensioners,' he said.

'We
 didn't see them in the programme we just saw the people who were 
shoplifting. My experience of people on benefits is they are not 
shoplifting they want to work.'

In Benefits Street: The Last Word, a new documentary shown before the debate, Fungi told film makers that politicians are unaware of the reality of his lifestyle. 'They wouldn't understand what it's like to go "There's a tenner, make that last three days"'

Conservative minister Mike Penning also accused the broadcaster of being unrealistic in their portrayal of life on benefits.

'You were very selective in your cuts. You were very very selective about what you did there,' he said.

'You
 picked on a certain group of people and you didn't really tell them the
 full truth about what you were going to do, I don't think.'

Benefits
 Street explored day-to-day life in James Turner Street, Winson Green, 
where, it is claimed, as many as 90 per cent of people claim benefits.

Many of the residents have become national celebrities as a result of the media coverage.

But the series proved controversial and Channel 4 received more than 200 complaints after the first episode.

It has attracted criticism for being ‘poverty porn’ and sensationalising the thorny issue of benefits, unemployment and housing.

A
 Sunday newspaper recently claimed Kelly is now so prized by Channel 4 
that they offered her ‘thousands of pounds’ as an inducement not to take
 part in Big Brother, a rival Channel 5 show, and secure her services 
exclusively.

‘No comment,’ she replied when asked about it.

Channel
 4 said the series, filmed over more than a year, was a ‘fair reflection
 of the reality of life on a street where the majority of households 
receive benefits’.

Another resident, former drug addict 
Fungi, whose real name is James Clarke, told film makers that 
politicians are unaware of the reality of his lifestyle.

'They don't know what's going on,' the 44-year-old said.

'They don't understand our life. They

Around five million viewers watched each episode, making it the most popular show on Channel 4 in more than a year.

Viewers were concerned about how crime and benefits claimants were portrayed in the programme.

Channel
 4 said the series, filmed over more than a year, was a ‘fair reflection
 of the reality of life on a street where the majority of households 
receive benefits’.

The broadcaster has announced plans for a new series of the hit show but it will not be filmed in Birmingham.
