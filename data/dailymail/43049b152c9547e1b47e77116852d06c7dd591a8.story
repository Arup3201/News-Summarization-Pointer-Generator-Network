2011 has ended on the highest of notes for cyclist Mark Cavendish.

Just two months after announcing he is to become a father for the first time, the 26-year-old has been named BBC Sports Personality of the Year.

Accepting his award at the ceremony, the tearful sportsman dedicated it to his teammates and to his pregnant girlfriend, glamour model Peta Todd.

The couple announced in October that Peta, 25, was pregnant with the baby - her second - and due in April.

In an interview at the time of the 
announcement, she revealed: 'We planned it. I'm four months gone, which 
means it was conceived in July, during the Tour de France. It's a Tour 
baby.'

The ecstatic model tweeted as she 
proudly cheered on her man: 'Congratu-BLOODY-lations...!!! Thank you so 
SO much for everyones support. Proud doesn't come close.'

Cavendish, who was world race champion and winner of five stages at this year's Tour de France, saw off competition from distance runner Mo Farah and golfer Darren Clarke to land the top prize at the glitzy BBC ceremony in Salford.

He had long been the odds on favourite to scoop Sports Personality of the Year 2011 following an extraordinary 12 months.

Landmark: Mark Cavendish hailed the award as 'an honour' before paying tribute to the other nominees and his pregnant girlfriend

Personal triumph: Bookies' favourite Cavendish won this year after previously winning four stages of the Tour de France in 2008 but not even getting nominated

The Isle of Man rider achieved the 
two huge goals he set for himself in 2011, becoming the first Briton to 
win the green jersey in the Tour de France and then clinching gold in 
the road race at the World Championships.

In addition to dedicating the award to Miss Todd, Cavendish, who joins Tommy 
Simpson and Sir Chris Hoy as cycling's winners of the award, said: 'I'm 
absolutely speechless.

'A few of my team-mates here will say that's a rare thing. Without those guys this wouldn't even be close to possible.

'I had a group of guys in (the World Championships in) Copenhagen who rode incredible and that brought a rainbow jersey back to Britain after more than half a decade, and that's a massive thing.'

Cavendish has established himself as one of the best sprinters in the history of cycling and this year took his tally of Tour de France stage wins to 20.

The award will be a personal triumph for 
Cavendish, who despite winning four stages of the Tour de France in 2008
and six in 2009, has yet to land one of the most prestigious prizes in 
British sport.

Podium places: Golder Darren Clarke came in 
second at the glitzy BBC award ceremony in Salford, while distance 
runner Mo Farah, pictured with his wife Tania and daughter Rihanna, came
third

After winning four stages in 2008 he was not even nominated, and described the four seconds air time he got from host Sue Barker that year as 'four daggers through my heart'.

But the cycling star was not to be denied in 2011 and scooped the prize ahead of Darren Clarke in second and Mo Farah in third.

Veteran Clarke was an emotional and surprise winner of the Open Championship this summer, five years after his wife Heather died of breast cancer.

Still going strong: Former Personality of the Year, boxer Joe Calzaghe, and his dancer girlfriend Kristina Rihanoff turned up the glamour at the event

Farah starred at the athletics World Championships in Daegu, South Korea, becoming the first British athlete to win the 5,000 metres title and also taking silver in the 10,000m.

After receiving the award, Cavendish said: 'I would like to thanks everyone who 
supported me, my girlfriend Peta and her little bump, and obviously well
done to all the other people who were nominated.

'In an incredible year for British 
sport....where we can produce champions from such a small place, and to 
be yo against nine inspirational people - I'm lost for words.'

'It's a landmark in cycling.'

Elsewhere at the glitzy award 
ceremony hosted by Gary Lineker and Sue Barker, Coach of the Year award 
went to England cricket team director Andy Flower, who guided England to
a first Ashes win in Australia in more than 20 years.

The Zimbabwean, who beat Manchester 
United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and Wales rugby coach Warren Gatland to 
the award, said: 'This is a very proud moment for me to stand here, 
England has been very good to me and my family.

'I'm very proud to be part of the England cricket team. They have done some wonderful things over the last couple of years.

'I think everyone in this room realises it's the players that make the hard decisions, play under pressure and have to deliver. It's great to have a good bunch of players and a good bunch of people to work with.'

England's cricket achievements were also honoured with the Team of the Year award, which was collected by captain Andrew Strauss, also a nominee for the individual award.

He said: 'This is a very special award 
for a couple of reasons. First there's so many great teams who have won 
this in the past. 'But also if there's one thing we've all bought into 
it is the idea the team is more important that the individual. It's the 
real basis of why we've done well and makes it even more special to win 
this accolade.'

Meanwhile, tennis world number one Novak Djokovic won the Overseas Sports Personality of the Year gong following a year in which he went 41 matches unbeaten and won the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the US Open.

Steve Redgrave, the former rower and arguably Britain's greatest ever Olympian, was honoured with the lifetime achievement award.

Redgrave won his first gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, and unforgettably won his fifth in Sydney at the 2000 Olympics.

Golfer Lauren Taylor, 17, was named Young Sports Personality of the Year.
