Facebook has locked out Native Americans from using the social network after deeming their names to be fake.

Several users, including Dana Lone Hill, Shane and Jacqui Creepingbear and Parmelee Kills The Enemy have had their accounts suspended or even deleted.

Users from indigenous tribes have received messages asking them to change their legal names to ones that do not 'violate [the company's] standards'.

Facebook's 'real name' policy states: 'We require people to provide the name they use in real life; that way, you always know who you're connecting with.'

Dana Lone Hill, a Lakota whose mother's surname is Lone Hill, and father's is Lone Elk, sent three forms of identification to Facebook so the company could 'investigate' whether she was a real person.

'I had a little bit of paranoia at first regarding issues I had been posting about until I realized I wasn't the only Native American this happened to,' she wrote.

'One friend was forced to change his name from his Cherokee alphabet to English. 

'Another was forced to include her full name, and a few were forced to either smash the two word last names together or omit one of the two words in the last name. 

'Oglala Lakota Lance Brown Eyes was booted from Facebook and when he turned in his proof of identification they changed his name to Lance Brown,' she claims.

After writing about her issue, Dana had her account reinstated, with facebook claiming it was 'a mistake'. 

To reestablish a Facebook account after being accused of using a fake name, users must submit one government-issued ID such as a birth certificate, passport or voter identification card or two other forms of identification such as library card and a yearbook photo.  

The struggle with Native American names comes after the Facebook's chief product officer, Chris Cox, had to apologise after the company refused to recognise names of some LGBT members.

Their accounts were shut down after they had used stage names that they are known by in communities such as drag circles.

A Facebook spokesperson had said: 'Over the last several months, we've made some significant improvements in the implementation of this standard, including enhancing the overall experience and expanding the options available for verifying an authentic name.

'We have more work to do, and our teams will continue to prioritize these improvements so everyone can be their authentic self on Facebook.'

Shane Creepingbear has a similar problem with his wife, and told colorlines the couple's ordeal came to a swift end when he had some friends who work in the tech industry contact Facebook directly. 

Shane, who's part of the Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma, says that he and Jacqui have 'administrative shields' on their Facebook accounts and that their names will no longer be questioned.

'It's a problem when someone decides they are the arbiter of names,' says Shane. 

'It can come off a tad racist.

'While FB can set the Terms and Conditions for use of its products positioning itself as the arbiter of what names are real smacks of bigotry.'
