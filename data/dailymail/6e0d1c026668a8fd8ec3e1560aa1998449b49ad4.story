What's in a name? Two things if you’re Antony Fowler, England’s brilliant boxing prospect for Commonwealth Games gold who deliberately miss-spells his first name and is fighting to make a claim to his second.

For Fowler, it’s a hefty challenge – his cousin was a footballer of some renown for Liverpool. ‘They call Robbie “God” around Liverpool,’ says Fowler. ‘I’m my own man, though. Robbie is Robbie. He made his name being a brilliant footballer. I want to make mine even bigger by being a brilliant boxer.’

He’s made a solid start. He’s the Liverpool middleweight identified by Lee Pullen, one of Britain’s finest coaches, as ‘the complete package’, a workhorse in the gym with the kick of a donkey in his right hand.

Glove affair: Antony Fowler will represent England at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

God: Antony wants to step out of cousin and former Liverpool striker Robbie's shadow

‘Not many 
amateurs knock people out like Antony,’ Pullen says. Some 46 of his 130 
wins have come early, an excellent ratio in the world of big gloves and 
padded heads, and Carl Froch told him he has the makings of a future 
world champion.

Fowler
 has a technician’s touch, a quick mouth and a pragmatist’s mind, a man 
who spells his name as ‘Anthony’ on Twitter because ‘that’s how people 
will search for it on Google and in boxing you have to be noticed’. That
 time could come for the 23-year-old in the next fortnight when he laces
 up his gloves at the Glasgow Games.

‘As
 a kid I was always in Robbie’s shadow,’ Fowler says. ‘I’d love to one 
day be bigger than him. I’m not being disrespectful when I say that 
because he was such a big player and he’s my cousin. I see him every few
 months and I’m a Liverpool fan.

‘We’re
 all proud of him, and his dad, Robert, my uncle, was a huge influence 
on me as a young fighter. My uncle gave me the same attitude he gave 
Robbie – never think you’re good enough, always try harder.  That’s why I
 want to be bigger than Robbie. Never accept being second best.‘I was in his shadow as a kid.

'People
 said, “He’s Robbie Fowler’s cousin”, rather than seeing me as my own 
person. I used to have “Fowler” on the back of my Liverpool shirt as a 
kid, but that was because it’s my name.

‘Like
 I say, I have nothing but respect for him, but I’ve done everything 
myself. No-one has given me a penny and I’ve never asked for one. It’s 
the way I want to do it and my way is working pretty well right now.’

Fate: Antony Fowler started his boxing career after a chance visit to a gym, aged 11

True Brit: Fowler won bronze at last year¿s world championships and is a two-time, two-weight national champ

Fowler’s
 boxing story started 12 years ago when the shy 11-year-old wanted to 
understand the fuss stirred up by one of his classmates.

‘I liked athletics and football,’ he says. ‘I was a striker but had two left feet.

‘There
 was a lad in my class who was a boxer and he always used to talk about 
it. One day, when I was about 11, he said to come down the gym so I did,
 just for something to do.

‘I
 went down there and he would ask if I wanted a spar. I was quite scared
 so I’d just say, “No I’m happy hitting the bag”. Then one day I sparred
 him and as soon as I hit him I dropped him.

‘It was probably my third trip to the gym. The other lad had been there six years - he didn’t come back.

‘There
 was an old fella at the gym, dead now, God rest his soul, called Jim 
Harper. He always used to say, “You’re the best we’ve ever seen”. I 
didn’t believe him, but he’d say, “You’ll box for England one day”.’

Hard hitter: 46 of Antony Fowler's 130 career wins have come by way of knockout

High praise: Carl Froch has told Antony Fowler he has the makings of a champion

Fowler 
boxed for England within two years. He has since won a bronze medal at 
last year’s world championships and is a two-time, two-weight national 
champion.

His
 eyes are fixed on Glasgow and in the back of his mind is the Olympics 
in two years, where he hopes to make up for lost time. ‘I should have 
gone to 2012 and I would have won a medal,’ he says.

‘I broke my nose just before qualifying and didn’t end up going. Fred Evans went and won silver.

‘I
 know I can beat Fred. But that’s in the past. I can’t say what will 
happen in the future but I will work harder than anyone in this sport 
for my future.

‘When
 I sparred with Carl Froch, I took his shots and landed some too. I know
 what I can do. I want that gold at the Commonwealths, then I want one 
at the Olympics. Then I’ll go to the pros and knock people out. I want a
 world title.’

It’s a tall list and a big shadow. These Games will go some way to showing how far Fowler can go in tackling both.

YANNICK and JOAKIM NOAHFlamboyant Frenchman Yannick will always be remembered for winning the French Open at Roland Garros in 1983, but his son is a fine sportsman in his own right. Joakim was drafted by the Chicago Bulls in the NBA in 2007 and Yannick’s father Zacharie was a professional footballer who played for Cameroon. Not a bad sporting family.

BILLIE JEAN KING  and RANDY MOFFITTThe legendary tennis star won an incredible 39  Grand Slam titles across singles and doubles, but she was born Billie Jean Moffitt. Her younger brother Randy was a baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants.

MACK and JACKIE ROBINSONMack is the 1936 Olympian you haven’t heard of. He won silver in the 200m behind the legendary Jesse Owens while his younger brother Jackie broke the colour code in baseball, becoming the first black man to play in the MLB.
