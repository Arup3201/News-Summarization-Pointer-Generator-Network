Years after they first made their mark Steve McQueen, Frank Sinatra, Madonna and Blondie are all still hip enough to have earned a place in the top 100 coolest Americans.

The 'American Cool' exhibit is currently on show at the National Portrait Gallery, in Washington, D.C. America, until 7 September.

Included in the exhibit are the likes of jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and Billie Holiday, actors such as Johnny Depp, and singers such as Elvis Presley and Debbie Harry.

The 'King of Rock and Roll' Elvis Presley sings to his fans - years after his 1977 death he is still regarded as cool

The curators of the exhibition had four defining factors of cool, of which people chosen had to fit at least three categories:

• originality of artistic vision and especially of a signature style

• cultural rebellion, or transgression in a given historical moment

• iconicity, or a certain level of high-profile recognition

• recognised cultural legacy (lasting more than a decade)

The term 'cool' originated in the United States in the early 1940s when legendary jazz saxophonist Lester Young brought the central African American concept into the modern vernacular.

Given the large number of celebrities that this term has been used to describe, an alternative list was also created for those who did not make the Top 100.

This list included the likes of Samuel L Jackson, Gwen Stefani, and Tom Petty.

The portraits that feature in the 
gallery were contemporary images shot by famous photographers such as 
Richard Avedon and Annie Leibovitz.

Kurt Cobain, lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter of the grunge band Nirvana who died in 1994. Right, Frederick Douglass, born in 1818, who escaped from slavery and became a leader of the abolitionist movement

Jazz singer and songwriter Bilie Holiday who died aged 44 in 1959 made the cut - just under a quarter of the 100 are women

American former professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, nicknamed 'The Birdman' was also deemed cool enough to make the top 100

Miles Davis, left, the single most dominating figure in jazz for the second half of the 20th century and right, McKinley Morganfield, known as Muddy Waters, who was an American blues musician and  is considered the 'father of modern Chicago blues'

James Dean famously portrayed troubled young man Jim Stark in 1955 Rebel Without A Cause becoming a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment. He died in a car accident in 1955

Kim Sajet, director of the National 
Portrait Gallery, said: 'American Cool is about America's greatest 
cultural export-cool-and who embodies it.'

'What you might find surprising about this show is how far back this idea reaches.

'I especially like this how this exhibition shows photographs of icons by world-renowned photographers.

'And that the show offers an opportunity for a national conversation about who defines 'cool.'

Over 25 years after his untimely death in 1980, actor Steve McQueen is still considered hip and 'cool' across the world

Bessie Smith, left, was an American blues singer. Nicknamed The Empress of the Blues, Smith was the most popular female blues singer of the 1920s and 1930s. Right, Walt Whitman was an American poet whose work was considered controversial in the 20th century

Scottish-born musician permanently residing in the United States, David Byrne is a founding member of the American new wave band Talking Heads

Jean-Michel Basquiat was an American artist. By the time he died in 1988 he had risen from a graffiti artist in his hometown of New York to an international star

One of the most prominent cultural icons for over three decades, Madonna has achieved an unprecedented level of power and control for a woman in the entertainment world.
