Quizzed: Neil Wallis leaves Hammersmith police station in London, after his arrest over phone hacking allegations

Former executive editor of the News of the World Neil Wallis was hired by the Metropolitan Police as a consultant last year, it was claimed today.

The 60-year-old, who was Andy Coulson's deputy at the time of the scandal, was being questioned by detectives probing the phone hacking scandal. He is the ninth person to be arrested.

Wallis, who had been working in PR since leaving the paper in 2009, was arrested in a 6.30am swoop on his west London home. Sky News said he had been hired by the police last year.

Tonight he was photographed leaving Hammersmith Police Station shortly before 5pm.

His company Chamy Media was paid £24,000 by the force for 'communications advice' in 2009 and 2010 while the force's deputy director of public affairs was on sick leave.

As part of the contract, Wallis advised the commissioner's office, the directorate of public affairs and specialist operations.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson has made the chair of the police authority aware of the contract, which ceased before Operation Weeting started in January this year.

Today he insisted he has done nothing wrong as it also emerged he has had dinner with Wallis.

The Scotland Yard chief said developments in the News of the World inquiry in recent weeks were 'deeply disturbing' as he addressed members of the Metropolitan Police Authority.

When asked whether he regretted his decision in 2006 to have dinner with the then deputy editor, the commissioner said he had no reason to suspect any wrongdoing.

It has also emerged today that detectives have told a cousin of Jean Charles de Menezes his number was found on the phone hacking list of a News of the World private investigator.

Other people connected to the young Brazilian shot dead by police marksmen at Stockwell Tube station in 2005 fear they too may have been targeted.

In another development, the Hacked 
Off campaign is consulting its lawyers over whether some witnesses 
called before the inquiry should be granted immunity from prosecution to
speed up proceedings.

It will submit a recommendation to inquiry judge 
Lord Justice Leveson.

Former
Lib Dem MP Evan Harris, a member of the group, said: 'Some people feel 
that anyone who has been involved in wrongdoing should face a criminal 
trial and other people are very keen that the truth comes out as quickly
as possible, even if that means giving immunity to the people who admit
to wrongdoing.'

As Andy Coulson's 
former deputy Neil Wallis was arrested in the phone hacking inquiry 
today, neighbours claimed he had done nothing wrong.

The woman, who refused to be named, said: 'I just told her we are all very sympathetic because he has done nothing wrong.

'I am extremely sorry about Neil because he has been such a good neighbour to us all.'

The developments came as Rebekah 
Brooks confirmed she will appear before a Commons Culture Select 
Committee next Tuesday.

Rupert and James Murdoch both said they are 'too
busy' to attend and now will be issued with a formal summons.

Today Nick Clegg said they had to show they were accountable to the public.

The
deputy Prime Minister said on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'We need
to look at whether they have got the power and the ability to compel 
them.

'If someone cannot be compelled I don't know whether we can frogmarch them to the select committee.

'But
if they have any shred of sense of responsibility or accountability for
their position of power then they should come and explain themselves to
the select committee.'

The committee could issue a formal 
summons forcing Rebekah Brooks to attend as she is a British citizen. If
she failed to turn up she would be in contempt of court.

It was expected to emerge later whether they had accepted an invitation to appear before the panel.

Yesterday Mr Murdoch pulled the plug on a £10billion deal to buy the remaining 61 per 
cent of BSkyB he does not own in the face of massive pressure.

Andy Coulson's deputy Neil Wallis was nicknamed 'Wolfman' because he is short, used to have lots of facial hair and is aggressive.

The 60-year-old suspect has been described as a 'no-nonsense, larger-than-life character whose every utterance is peppered with expletives'.

He stood down as News of the World's executive editor in 2009 and had been working in PR.

He started working for News International in 1986 for 12 years where he held senior positions before taking the job of News Editor at The Sun.

In 1998 he became editor of the People, a job he held for five years before returning to become deputy editor of the News of the World in 2003 working under Andy Coulson.

According to mediaweek, Wallis led a redesign of the newspaper in 2002 and launched a sports supplement to help in a battle against the Daily Star.

Last week Andy Coulson was grilled by detectives for 10 hours over allegations of corruption and phone hacking.

Today detectives from Operation Weeting - the 
Scotland Yard investigation into mobile interceptions by News 
International - made a fresh arrest.

A spokesman for Scotland Yard confirmed they had carried out a raid.

'The man is currently in custody at a west London police station. It would be inappropriate to discuss any further details at this time,' a statement said.

The man was being held on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications.

As Andy Coulson was held last week police also arrested former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, 53, and an unnamed 63-year-old man in connection with allegations of corruption

All three men were released on bail until October.

Rupert Murdoch was forced to shelve his offer to buy satellite broadcaster BSkyB as it became clear that David Cameron, Nick 
Clegg and Ed Miliband were joining forces in a Commons vote urging him 
to back off.

It came as Mr Cameron relented in the 
face of intense pressure from Labour and the Liberal Democrats and 
agreed to a judicial inquiry into press standards, regulation and 
ownership, and allegations of illegal phone hacking by the News of the 
World and police corruption.

Media proprietors, including Mr 
Murdoch, as well as senior politicians, police chiefs and journalists 
accused of phone hacking, are all expected to be summoned under oath.

The probe will be headed by Lord Justice Leveson, who prosecuted Britain’s worst female serial killer, Rose West.

Yesterday the scandal spread to the U.S. as 
family members of victims of the 9/11 attacks called for an 
investigation of claims their phones were hacked.

There were claims that Murdoch was considering selling off his remaining British newspapers The Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times.

Mr Cameron also vowed that media executives responsible for the scandal would be barred from owning newspapers or broadcasters.

'The people involved – whether they 
were directly responsible for the wrongdoing, sanctioned it, or covered 
it up, however high or low they go – must not only be brought to 
justice, they must also have no future role in the running of a media 
company in our country,’ he said.

Labour leader Mr Miliband hailed the 
move, inconceivable only a few days ago, as 'a victory for people up and
down this country who have been appalled by the revelations of the 
phone hacking scandal and the failure of News International to take 
responsibility’.

The collapse of the takeover bid was 
announced by News Corp deputy chairman Chase Carey, who said it had 
'become clear that it is too difficult to progress in this climate’.

The
firm will have to pay BSkyB a 'break fee’ of £38.5million after walking
away from the deal.

The furore had already led to the 
closure of the News of the World, the UK’s biggest-selling Sunday 
newspaper.
