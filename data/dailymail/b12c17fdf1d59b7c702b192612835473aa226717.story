Baby ban: The 2012 organisers have said every child, including babes-in-arms, must have their own ticket

Babies who do not have tickets for the Olympics will be excluded from the Games - even if they had not been conceived when their parents bought seats.

Parents who bring their infants to the Games without a valid tickets for them will be refused entry, in a move which has sparked anger among new and expectant parents.

The 2012 organisers have said every child, including small babies carried in their parents’ arms, must have their own ticket or they will not be allowed in.

A press spokesman admitted the Olympics helpline had received calls from pregnant women and expectant fathers whose babies will just be a few weeks old when the Games commence.

They have been told they can try and buy an extra ticket for their chosen event, otherwise the infant will be prevented from entering the venue.

The issue has attracted fury on the Mumsnet website in the last few weeks, with parents saying they are being forced to pay full price for babies not yet born.

Some are doubting whether extra tickets will be available for the popular events they are attending.

One woman described it as the 'biggest rip-off in the history of London' while others wondered what to do with babies they will be breastfeeding.

Another said: 'The whole thing is ridiculous, there are people who bought tickets before their babies were even conceived - how are they supposed to know to buy a ticket for a child that doesn’t exist yet?

'There should be more complaining about this policy. It’s nuts.'

Another woman described the policy as 'bloody stupid'.

She added: 'The baby isn’t taking up a seat, and if they’re worried about fire regulations or whatever then it’s not as if the baby isn’t going to be with you at all times - essentially you should be counted as one person.

'The baby’s not using the facilities on its own.'

One 'fuming' pregnant woman wrote: 'I’m shocked by the conversation I just had with the London 2012 ticketing people.

'My husband and I were lucky enough to get tickets to the horse jumping in August. Our baby is due 2 June, so was inquiring about what I need to do about tickets for the new baby.

'They said everyone needs a ticket - fine. Children’s tickets are £1 - fine.

'I have to pay £95 to have a three-month-old in a sling'

'But there are no children’s tickets for the horse jumping so I have to pay £95 to have a three-month-old in a sling!

'They said the only alternative was to re-sell my ticket or give it to someone else.'

Another accused the organisers of discrimination, saying women could not have been expected to bid on extra tickets in case they got pregnant.

'It is generally accepted that a new baby is an adjunct of its mother, especially if breastfeeding.'

Another described the 'anti-baby policy' as 'completely unreasonable', adding it 'clearly shows that mums were not involved in devising this policy.

'I attended several hockey games and opening ceremonies at the Vancouver games with a three-month-old (their policy was you could bring a 0-2-year-old, no problem).

'It was NOT a problem. As a rule, there were diaper changing facilities in all restrooms. And I had bought the tickets before the baby was even a sparkle in his mum’s eyes.'

One woman on Mumsnet said she is likely to miss out on the Olympics as a result of the policy.

She said 'it does feel like discrimination', adding she has four tickets for sailing.

'We will apparently need another ticket for a baby not even born yet and certainly not conceived when we bid for tickets.'

She said she would bid for another ticket but did not hold out much hope.

'If I cannot get another ticket, then it looks as though the baby won't be able to go and so neither will I.

Outrage on Mumsnet: 'If I cannot get another ticket, then it looks as though the baby won't be able to go and so neither will I'

'I normally keep well clear from the 
breast v bottle discussions, but this does feel like discrimination 
against those people who are breastfeeding.

'And those unable/unwilling to leave a very small baby in the care of someone else.'

Another woman said she objected to the
fact that she needed 'to get another ticket that in all probability 
won't exist... Stopping me and potentially my family from going.

'It 
will be a while until I know if I can even get another ticket (April, 
provided the website is working by then), regardless of the cost, and 
probably too late by then to be able to re-sell any tickets we are 
subsequently unable to use.'

Anyone wishing to re-sell their tickets must submit their request to Olympic organisers by a February 3 deadline. A second wave of ticket re-sales will occur in April.

According
to 2012 organisers, it possible for people to give tickets away to 
friends and family as long as they are not sold on the open market.
