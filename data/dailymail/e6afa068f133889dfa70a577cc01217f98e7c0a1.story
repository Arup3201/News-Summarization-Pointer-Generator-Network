Now that the BCCI have been formally enshrined as the only administration that matters, and the ECB have been seduced into believing they matter too, the five-Test series starting in Nottingham on Wednesday has a lot to live up to.

After all, if the players don’t match the star billing currently afforded to the men in suits, things could get rather awkward. Giants off the field, pygmies on it – this is not a slogan that would sit comfortably alongside the omnipotence of N Srinivasan and Giles Clarke.

We exaggerate, of course. But not by much. India sit fourth in the Test rankings, England fifth. It’s like the 2009 Ashes, when two mid-table sides did flawed battle until England picked Jonathan Trott at the last minute and won at The Oval. Another left-field move could swing the result this time.

Feeling the heat: Alastair Cook could be under real pressure if England lose to India at Trent Bridge

Both sets of fans seem subdued. The English fear for Alastair Cook and the fitness of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. The Indians worry about their ability to claim 20 wickets, and their lack of experience. Either way, we have been spared too much gloating-in-advance.

The likelihood is that we will get a cagey series. Cook is lucky to be captain after the fiasco at Headingley, where his blinkered tactics condemned England to their first home series defeat by Sri Lanka. If India go 2-0 up, England will be looking for a new captain.

Yet Cook’s one saving grace is that he will be up against a man who has not led his side to a Test victory outside India for three years. Since beating West Indies in Jamaica in June 2011, India have played 14 matches overseas, drawing four and losing 10. And it is a sequence that, for MS Dhoni, includes several days akin to Cook at Headingley.

Almost as bad as India’s 4-0 defeats in England and Australia were their failures to win last winter in Johannesburg and Wellington.

In the first of those, it was  – mystifyingly – South Africa who stood accused of bottling it after closing on 450 for seven in pursuit of 458 on an up-and-down last-day pitch at the Wanderers. And at Wellington, with New Zealand beginning the fourth day effectively six for five, Dhoni was alarmingly quick to shed his slips. Brendon McCullum responded with a triple-century.

Despite his reputation as an aggressive limited-overs batsman, Dhoni is not a man for whom Test-match offence comes naturally.

The reason he is still in a job tells you plenty about the different priorities of English and Indian cricket. Under Dhoni, India have been the best limited-overs tournament team in the world, winning the 2011 World Cup, the 2013 Champions Trophy, and almost completing the hat-trick before losing to Sri Lanka in the final of the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh in April.

Even if England ever manage to reach another World Cup final, it’s unlikely that this success would spare the captain if he were to keep losing Test series – especially to Australia, especially 5-0. That doesn’t make the English way better; it’s just different.

Dhoni also inhabits a different world from Cook’s, straddling the sporting and celebrity nexuses with a calm assurance that may stem, in part, from his own sense of inviolability.

Whenever journalists attempt to ask him a politically sensitive question at a press conference, a BCCI minder steps in. Yesterday, the BCCI’s own website published an exclusive interview with him – the first that has appeared anywhere for some time. It goes without saying that his woeful record overseas didn’t get an airing. Yet this, it appears, is how things work: Dhoni speaks on his own terms, or not at all.

In one sense, Cook and Dhoni do have something in common. Both have the blessings of higher forces: Dhoni is protected by Srinivasan, while Cook is being cheered on by England MD Paul Downton, who has staked much of his reputation on backing him, while sacking Kevin Pietersen.

Limited appeal: MS Dhoni is a superb one-day captain but is less effective in Test matches

And yet you suspect something will have to give over the next seven weeks. Victory for India, and Cook won’t be able to blame a Mitchell Johnson or an Angelo Mathews. Victory for England, and even Srinivasan may reflect that Dhoni’s captaincy just isn’t working at Test level.

The whole thing could hinge on how well Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli handle the swinging ball – assuming it swings at all. Their partnerships could provide the sights and sounds of the summer.

Otherwise, don’t be surprised if we are not treated to a classic, for this series pits a team that has forgotten how to win against a team that wins only at home. And both captains are – or at least ought to be – concerned about what happens next. May the less fearful side prevail.

It’s easy to mock cricketers for being dull interviewees, so let’s hear it for Devon Malcolm, whose response to a question in All Out Cricket magazine prompted uncharitable thoughts of a wind-up.

Asked which living person he most admired and why, Dev said: ‘Margaret Beckett (Labour MP for Derby South), she is so honest and consistent. She is a role model of mine – in any decision I think, “What would Margaret Beckett do?”’

And to think we always imagined that the inspiration behind Malcolm’s you-guys-are-history seven for 57 against South Africa at The Oval in 1994 had been Fanie de Villiers…

Andrew Strauss writes in the Sunday Times that part of the reason Duncan Fletcher is held in ‘high regard’ by the players he has worked with is his ‘healthy disregard for the media’. Strauss uses his – presumably well-paid – column in the media to make this point.

Quite obviously cricketers are not going to enjoy every word that’s ever been spoken or written about them. But it seems strange to applaud as ‘healthy’ a disregard for the people who convey the sport to those not lucky enough to attend matches in person – especially when you’re now one of those people yourself.

Disregard: Andrew Strauss (left) enjoys taking a pop at the media despite now being part of it

How democratic is the new ICC now that most the power lies in the hands of India, with a little left over for England and Australia? Last week we were reminded of the venues for ICC events in the next cycle of media and sponsorship rights (2015-23) – and provided with an answer to the question.

After the forthcoming World Cup early next year in Australia and New Zealand will come the following: the 2016 World Twenty20 (in India); the 2017 Champions Trophy (England); the 2019 World Cup (England); the 2020 World Twenty20 (Australia); the 2021 Champions Trophy (India); and the 2023 World Cup (India).

In other words, it will be 10 years at the earliest before the global event takes place anywhere outside the confines of the Big Three. Let’s hope the rest of the world doesn’t lose interest in the meantime.

There was uproar last week when people took offence at the way other people had taken offence at the fact that Maria Sharapova had never heard of Sachin Tendulkar. But what did they expect? A sane and rational shrug of the shoulders from manic fans who regard Tendulkar as a deity? No, me neither.

Who are ya? Maria Sharapova said she had never head of Sachin Tendulkar (right)
