The Bush family today shared the first pictures of its newest member - Margaret Laura 'Mila' Hager.

Jenna Bush Hager gave birth to the healthy little girl in New York City at 8.43pm on Saturday, making former President George W Bush and wife Laura grandparents for the first time.

Intimate images released by the family today show the proud new grandfather cradling the tiny bundle alongside his beaming wife, while another shows Jenna and her mother cooing over the little girl.

There's also some early family bonding as George Bush and his son-in-law Henry Hager are seen holding Mila up to watch the Masters tournament on the hospital television.

And one family portrait shows Jenna holding her tiny daughter surrounded by her parents and husband Henry, with a drawing of a heart containing the word 'Mila' hanging behind them.

In a statement, President Bush said: 'Laura and I are thrilled to announce the birth of our grandchild. We met our beautiful granddaughter today. Jenna and Mila are healthy. And our family is elated.'

Mila was named after her grandmothers, like Jenna herself and her twin sister Barbara.

The
 Bush family has frequently named babies after their predecessors. Other
 examples include George, Prescott, Walker, Ellis, Pierce and Dorothy.

A heavily pregnant Jenna Bush Hager was seen around New York City last week running errands in a bright pink, 
figure-hugging long top that showed off her large baby bump.

Until then Bush had tried to conceal her bump with shapeless shift dresses,
 but last Wednesday the mother-to-be decided on the shape-defining top.

The previous week the Today show correspondent, who announced her pregnancy in December last year, held a baby shower with her NBC co-workers Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie.

According to People magazine, the gift table was piled with dozens of 
her co-worker's favorite childhood books - each inscribed with a piece 
of parenting advice.

Meredith Viera gave a copy of We're Going on a Bear Hunt, with the advice: 'Get a nap anytime you can.'

Meanwhile Savannah Guthrie gave 
Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, and Kathie 
Lee Gifford offered Party Animals.

Goodnight Moon, given by news anchor Natalie Morales, was also among the shower gifts.

'I have read this book so many times, I 
have it committed to memory and committed to song, because I have to 
jazz it up - not just for my kids,' explained Ms Morales.

Last month, Laura and George W. Bush, swept into the couple's lower Manhattan 
apartment to whip 
the nursery together and painted it green - as they did not know the gender of the baby.

Mr Bush, who has taken up painting since his eight-year stint in the White House, contributed the nursery's artwork.

'He’s 
become an artiste. There’s a whole new side of him and he’s so excited 
about the baby,' Mrs Bush Hager explained.

Before her NBC co-workers left for the afternoon, she made sure they knew how grateful she was.

'It
 made me feel really happy to work where we work,' said Mrs Bush Hager. 
'I already feel 100 percent supported, which is a really amazing 
feeling.

She also promised to
be back in the studio after a summer maternity leave.

'I’ll bring this baby to work — on the subway, I guess,' she said. 'I haven’t figured that part out yet.'

Mrs Bush Hager and her husband, 34, who got married in 2008 on former President Bush's Texas ranch, will be celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary in June.

The busy mother-to-be is an editor-at-large for Southern Living magazine as well as a contributing correspondent on the Today show.
