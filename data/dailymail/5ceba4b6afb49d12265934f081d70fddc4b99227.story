This map reveals the startling number of American homeowners drowning in debt after being left locked in negative equity in the wake of the economic crisis.

It shows the percentage of people who owe more on their mortgage than their property is worth - classed as 'underwater' homeowners - across the U.S. by county.

More than 14 million Americans were struggling in negative equity in the third quarter of the year, research has shown.

'Underwater': The map shows the percentage of homeowners in negative equity across the U.S. by county

The red counties on the map have more underwater homes than the national average of 28.2 per cent, while blue counties have fewer.

In the Miami-Fort Lauderdale area of Florida 41.4 per cent of homeowners are underwater, and 29.1 per cent of those owe more than double what their property is worth.

In all 25.5 per cent of the area's underwater owners are 'delinquent' - meaning they are more than 90 days late on their mortgage repayments.

Other major cities badly hit hit include Chicago, where 36.6 per cent of homeowners are in negative equity, and Seattle, where 34.2 per cent are classed as underwater.

Despite the levels of debt, real 
estate specialist Zillow said negative equity had in fact receded in the
third quarter, which saw the biggest quarterly rise in property values 
since 2006.

In the second quarter, an average of 30.9 per cent - 15.3 million homeowners - were underwater.

'National home values appreciated 1.3
percent from Q2 to Q3 2012, with much of that appreciation focused in 
hard-hit areas, like Arizona, Florida and California,' Zillow told
Businessinsider.com.

But the firm's chief economist Stan Humphries said house prices were still not immune to 'shocks' from the broader economy.

'While we're moving in the right 
direction, a substantial number of homes are still locked up in negative
equity, unable to enter the existing re-sale market despite the desires
of their owner,' he said.

'The housing market has found real 
momentum of its own, but is not immune from shocks to the broader 
economy. If negotiations centred on resolving the fiscal cliff don't 
inspire confidence in investors and consumers alike, recent home value 
gains - and, as a result, falling negative equity rates - could stall,' 
Mr Humphries added.

The collapse in the U.S. housing market is widely regarded as a root cause of the global economic crisis.

Property prices peaked in 2006 in the States before the housing bubble burst the following year. Between 2004 and 2006 the percentage of risky subprime mortgages - those extended to borrowers with poor credit histories - rose to a new high of around 20 per cent. The vast majority were adjustable-rate mortgages, meaning interest rates vary according to the cost to the lender of borrowing on the credit markets.

When U.S. house prices began to decline steeply in 2006, owners struggled to keep up with rising monthly payments as their adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher interest rates.

The numbers of people defaulting on their payments soared as did the number of foreclosures.

This, combined with simultaneous crashes in other asset bubbles, saw fears over the soundness of the U.S. credit and financial markets lead to credit tightening around the world.
