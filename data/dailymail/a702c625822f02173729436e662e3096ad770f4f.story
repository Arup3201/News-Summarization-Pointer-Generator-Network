A radio host’s integrity is being questioned on social media after he fell into the trap of pranksters impersonating guests over the phone twice in the past couple of months.

Talkback host Tom Elliott was led to believe he was talking to Australian rapper 360 on his 3AW radio show on Monday - while the legitimate artist was filming himself listening to the impersonator be interviewed and then posted the footage on his Facebook page.

It is the second time Elliott has been caught with egg on his face after a Kurdish man, living in Scandinavia, pretended to be ISIS commander Omar al-Shishani during a phone interview in August.

360 films himself listening to someone impersonate him in an interview with Tom Elliott on his 3AW radio show

Elliott admits on Twitter that he finally realised he was not speaking with the real 360

This is the second time Elliott has been caught with egg on his face after a Kurdish man, living in Scandinavia, pretended to be ISIS commander Omar al-Shishani during a phone interview in August

The Melbourne radio host thought he was talking to 360 about his controversial remarks on ABC TV show Q & A on October 20 where he said he identified the Australian flag with racism.

360, whose real name is Matt Colwell, took great delight in filming himself listening to the show where the impersonator told Elliott that he had joined the Illuminati – an historical secret society.

‘I was inducted because I am enlightened,’ the caller said when Elliott questioned that calling himself enlightened being was racist.

‘It has nothing to (do with) race it’s a mind frame,’ the fake 360 said.

The conversation then became even more bizarre when the prankster declared himself as a unicorn.

‘Who are you to say I’m not a unicorn?’ he said.

‘All I’m trying to do is open everyone’s minds up to these racist ideals and you are just trying to stomp them out.’

It wasn’t until the caller mentioned the previous prank that Elliott began to question his identity.

‘Last few weeks didn’t you interview an Isis fighter who turned out not to be an Isis fighter at all?’ he asked.

‘Yeah, we did and we acknowledged that, are you sure you’re Matt Colwell here?’ Elliot replied.

A Tweeter incredulous as to how the studio didn't check who the caller was before going to air

Although the impersonator never admitted to the hoax, he went on to ask about the show’s screening process.

‘How much research goes into who you actually interview? Or do they just ring up and say “Hi I’m 360” and I come on?’ he said.

After almost nine minutes, Elliott ended the interview and then conceded on Twitter that his guest was in fact an impersonator.

'Spoke to someone on-air and off-air who said that he was rapper 360. Turns out he wasn't. We shut the interview down immediately,' he posted.

The authentic 360 took to Twitter with several posts.

'1 thing I hope everyone takes tonight is DONT believe eveything the media tells you,' one said.

This prompted many fellow Tweeters to ridicule Elliott for falling for the stunt a second time.

It was suggested Elliott was also about to interview Elvis, Jesus, 2PAC and Martin Luther King.

Some posted saying they had lost all credibility for the talk back host.

'It lieterally took me 30 seconds to find 3ree6ixty's manger's contact info. Do you even know what research is? Clown.' RocknRollJoe. said.
