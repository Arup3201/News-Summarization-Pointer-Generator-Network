Army families and MPs last night condemned ‘disgraceful incompetence’ and Establishment meddling for holding up the Iraq war inquiry.

John Chilcot yesterday told David Cameron it will be ‘some further months’ before he can publish his report. 

Launched six years ago, Sir John’s inquiry is expected to criticise dozens of senior figures.

The delay means voters will go to the polls in May without knowing the official verdict on one of Britain’s most disastrous military ventures.

John Miller, whose 21-year-old son Simon died in a massacre near Basra in 2003, said the delay was disgraceful.

‘It is becoming the biggest cover-up of our generation,’ he said. ‘We simply can’t understand it.’

Tim Farron, a senior Lib Dem, said: ‘It’s about the Establishment protecting themselves.’

The country’s top civil servant, cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood, was also in the firing line for withholding key documents.

In a personal attack, former foreign secretary Lord Owen said: ‘I have never known a cabinet secretary to have such a veto.

‘It seems to me that he hasn’t had that independence of mind that is necessary. I can only say I am worried about it.’

As Sir John faced calls to appear before MPs to explain the delays:

The inquiry was set up by then prime minister Gordon Brown in 2009 and took public evidence from its last witness in 2011. 

But publication has been held up by wrangling over the release of confidential messages and the so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process by which people who are criticised in the report are given the chance to respond.

In an exchange of letters yesterday, Sir John explained to Mr Cameron that he would not be able to report before the May 7 general election. 

His admission came against a backdrop of increasing Westminster anger over the delays, which were due to be addressed in a Commons debate next week.

At Prime Minister’s Questions, the Father of the House, Conservative MP Sir Peter Tapsell, attacked the Chilcot inquiry’s ‘disgraceful incompetence’.

Sir Peter asked Mr Cameron: ‘Do you fully recognise the contrast in efficiency between the inquiries into the Crimean war and the Dardanelles campaign when compared to the disgraceful incompetence of the Chilcot inquiry into widely held suspicions that Mr Blair conspired with president George W Bush several months before March of 2003 and then systematically sought to falsify the evidence on which that action was taken?’

Mr Cameron said the hold-up was extremely frustrating and the report should have been published years ago.

Mr Blair insisted he was not responsible for the delay, telling Bloomberg: ‘Absolutely and emphatically, this is not to do with me, or as far as I’m aware any other witness.

‘I’ve as much interest as anybody in wanting to see the report published.’ He is understood to have received the final documents from the inquiry only a few days ago.

Sir Richard Ottaway, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, said there could be ‘no justification whatsoever’ for the process dragging on. He said Sir John had been summoned before his committee to explain.

Here is an edited account of the exchange of letters between Sir John Chilcot and David Cameron:

SIR JOHN WROTE:

Dear Prime Minister, 

I last wrote to you in November 2013, and to Sir Jeremy Heywood in May 2014, with an update on progress of the Iraq Inquiry. My colleagues and I have made very substantial progress since my last letter.

I can confirm that individuals are currently being given the opportunity to respond to provisional criticism of them in the Inquiry’s draft report. That is an essential and confidential process. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on it in detail.

We intend to finish our work as soon as it is possible to do so whilst being fair to all those involved. Until we have received and evaluated responses from all those who have been given the opportunity to respond, I cannot give an accurate estimate for how long it will then take to complete our work, but it is clear that will take some further months. I therefore see no realistic prospect of delivering our report to you before the General Election in May 2015.

Our report will be based on a thorough and comprehensive account of the relevant events from 2001-2009. We are determined to fulfil the responsibility placed on us to identify lessons to be learned from the UK’s involvement in Iraq.

In that context, I am pleased to record that since I last wrote the Inquiry has reached agreement with Sir Jeremy on the publication of 29 of Mr Blair’s Notes to President Bush, subject to a very small number of essential redaction, alongside the Inquiry’s final report.

Agreement has also been reached on the detail of what material the Inquiry will publish in relation to records of conversations between Mr Blair and President Bush, consistent with the principles agreed last era.

Yours sincerely, 

Sir John Chilcot

MR CAMERON REPLIED: 

Dear Sir John, 

Thank you for your letter of today. As you know, I would have liked to have seen your report published already and certainly well before the forthcoming Election. The Iraq War, the lead up to it and its aftermath were hugely important events in this country’s recent history.

It is very important that your Inquiry sets out comprehensively for the British people what happened, and why, so that all the lessons can be learnt.

However, it is important that the Inquiry remains fully independent of Government and therefore the timetable and processes for completing your work are entirely for you to decide – not for the Government. So I have to respect your decision. I hope very much that you will be able to [submit the report] shortly thereafter.

Had the previous Government established this Inquiry when I first called for it, we would not be in this position today. But that cannot now be undone. 

Yours, 

David
