Festival fever is well and truly upon us, and although I missed out on Glastonbury as I'm filming in the Big Apple, I'll definitely be digging out the Hunters on my return as there are some awesome smaller UK events coming up I simply can't miss.

Last year top celebrity makeup artist Daniel Sandler created a gorgeous boho-style floral festival look for me, which you can check out here.

This year I've enlisted Daniel's help once more, but this time we've gone for something altogether different – a Gwen Stefani-esque party look that blends Nineties grunge-glam and futuristic cool. Here's how we did it.

Binky was inspired by Gwen Stefani for this year's festival look

GET THE LOOK

Step 1 - Ace of Base

At a festival, you need make-up that will make your skin look fresh and radiant as well as last all day. Daniel recommended the Clarins BB Cream – the coverage is enough to conceal any pesky blemishes while still allowing your skin to breathe.

It's easy to apply too – simply blend into the face with your fingertips, making sure to take the product down the neck to avoid tidemarks.

Step 2 - Paint It Black

A black kohl pencil (waterproof, of course!) is a foolproof festival essential – whatever the look you're going for. So next, Daniel lined my eyes generously with his Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet.

'Festival make-up needs to have a little bit of edge,' he explained, 'so to give the eyes a bit more attitude I smudged the liner out slightly with my Lip Brush for a slept-in effect that screams rock'n'roll.'

Step 3 - Glitter Bug

Daniel then loaded some of the Too Faced Glamour Dust Glitter Pigment in Pink Fire onto a smudger brush and gently dabbed it over my eyelids. The contrast of the shimmering lilac hue and the black eyeliner provides the perfect blend of girly and edgy.

He also applied some to the tops of my cheekbones for a super-cool holographic effect and across my lips to create the illusion of a fuller pout. The mantra 'less is more' certainly doesn't apply to festival make-up – so feel free to go as wild as you like. A little does go a long way with this pigment, though!

Step 4 - Fuschia Flutter

Instead of using a boring black mascara, Daniel decided to mix things up a bit and go for a vivid fuschia shade - in the form of Dior's Addict-It Lash Mascara – to really make the lashes pop.

A statement look like this calls for suitably bold brows, so Daniel defined and darkened mine using his Brown Velvet waterproof eye pencil, sweeping the colour through my brows with a small brush for added volume.

Step 5 - After Glow

To give my skin a rosy-radiant glow, Daniel swept his Daniel Sandler Radiant Sheen Illuminating Face Powder across the apples of my cheeks.

This pretty palette offers the perfect blend of golden and peachy tones to instantly perk up even the most hungover of complexions - plus the dark shade doubles up as a great contour colour.

Finally, Daniel painted my pout with Guerlain Rouge G Lipstick in Gemma – a bold lilac shade providing a matte but moisturising wash of colour.

So there you have it; a rave-ready festival look that will certainly make sure you stand out from the crowd - thanks Daniel!

I also thought I'd share with you my top five festival essentials in case any of you are off to a festival soon and are a bit stuck on what to pack in the beauty department.
