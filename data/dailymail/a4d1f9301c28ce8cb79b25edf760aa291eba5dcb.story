It features everything from iconic images of some of the most famous figures in history to heartwarming private pictures of ordinary people and animals simply posing up for the camera.

Flickr Commons has celebrated its fifth anniversary by showing off a collection of its most viewed and commented on photographs, including a picture of Winston Churchill at a meeting of Allied leaders during WWII and a photograph of a black dog smoking a pipe in Wales.

The website's collection of 'public domain' photographs was first launched on January 16, 2008 with 1,500 pictures, and has expanded rapidly since, now featuring more than 250,000.

Among the eye-catching images in the Flickr Commons collection is this iconic photo of Winston Churchill with President Roosevelt and Stalin at the Yalta Conference during WWII

The images include personal photographs such as this one (left) of
a dog smoking a pipe in Wales during the 1940s and a picture of a 
ship's cats, on the Royal Navy vessel HMS Hawkins (right)

The collection was found initially through a partnership with the US Library 
of Congress, with the key goal showing the 'hidden treasures in the 
world's public photography archives.'

Flickr also allows the public to input any facts about the images they may have about each of the images.

The collection has come from 56 different libraries, archives, and museums around the world.

Among the highlights of the collection are an image of two cats posing for the camera at the end of a gun barrel on a Royal Navy cruiser, a photgraph of Elvis Presley meeting President Richard Nixon at the White House in 1970 and a picture of a soldier catching some sleep in the trenches during World War I.

This picture of a baby and a dog on a sailing ship taken was taken by Sydney photographer Samuel J Hood. He took hundreds of photographs of ships and their crew as souvenirs of their visit

Other startling pictures include a man riding a one wheeled motorcycle in Holland during the 1930s, a Swedish farmer sporting an huge beard and a blind man holding a skeleton.

Some of the best of the collection are images of every day life, from the locksmith going about his business in a London street during the 1870s, to an Allied soldier playing with his pet kangaroo in Australia during WWII.

The collection was a mixture of colour and black and white photographs taken throughout the 20th Century.

A
Flickr spokesperson said the collection aimed to celebrate 'the 
wonderful diversity and quality of Flickr Commons photos.;

They said Flickr had asked 
Commons member institutions to send it links 'to a few of their most 
viewed, commented, or favourite images' to create the gallery.
