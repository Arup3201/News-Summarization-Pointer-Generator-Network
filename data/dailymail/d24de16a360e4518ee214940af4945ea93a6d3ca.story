Firefighters have put out a blaze at the Macy's flagship store in New York City.

The New York Fire Department said in a Twitter post at about 9:30 
p.m. Friday that the two-alarm fire burning in the basement of the 
iconic department store on 34th Street in Manhattan was under control.

Fire officials did not respond to repeated calls for more details. A 
spokeswoman for Macy's said people in the building were moved out of 
harm's way.

Blaze: Authorities say the fire started in the basement of the midtown Macy's about 8:15 p.m. Friday

Debris: Fire officials cleared all the people out of the store. There are no reported injuries

More than a dozen fire trucks responded to the scene. A stretch of 
sidewalk on Seventh Avenue between 34th and 35th Streets was shut down 
on the west side of the store and crowds of onlookers had gathered to 
watch.

The well-known department store has over 1 million square-feet of retail space.

The store made headlines earlier Friday when actor Robert Brown, an African-American, alleged that he was the victim of an unlawful stop-and-search while shopping at the 34th Street store.

Brown was briefly detained at the store as police told him 'that his identification was false and that he could not afford to make such an expensive purchase.

Investigation: Fire officials will now try to determine what caused the blaze

Huge: the retail giant has more than a million square feet of retail space in its flagship Manhattan store

Under control: Officials say the blaze is under control and then there were no injuries

Brown believes his detention was racially motivated, and has filed a lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme court.

A cause of the blaze currently is under investigation.
