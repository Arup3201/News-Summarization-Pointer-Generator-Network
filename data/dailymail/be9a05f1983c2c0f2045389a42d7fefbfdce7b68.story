Fall: Bailey Sumner, 11, died after falling from a zipwire ride because a safety harness was incorrectly attached, an inquest has heard

An eleven-year-old boy who died when he fell from a newly-installed zipwire at a children's adventure attraction had not been secured into his safety harness properly, an inquest heard yesterday.

Bailey Sumner, of Blackpool, died when he plunged from the 475ft-long Swampflyer ride at the award-winning GreenWood Forest Park near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, in April 2011.

An inquest jury at Dolgellau heard a carabiner clip, normally used by climbers, was connected to a 'false loop' in the safety attachment.

Giving evidence, Stephen Bristow, managing director of the site, said it should have been spotted by staff during the pre-launch checks.

'The training required them to be absolutely rigorous about what they were doing,' he said.

Bailey died at Gwynedd Hospital, Bangor.

'What we want to know is how he came to die,' coroner Nicola Jones told the eight jurors. 'This isn't a court that deals with any issues of blame. Nobody is on trial here.'

The inquest is due to last three days.

Pathologist Dr Anthony Caslin said Bailey died after suffering a brain injury due to a fractured skull following a fall from a height.

Mr Bristow said it had been decided to install a zipwire in November 2010. He did some research and sought advice about the type of safety harness to provide.

The SwampFlyer ride had been open just a week before the fatal accident

The Swampflyer opened on April 17, 2011, a week before the accident. It was taken down immediately afterwards. 'I didn't want it to remain there,' he said.'It was a symbol of tragedy.'

He said he didn't foresee, nor had he been warned, about the risk of a false loop. He had taken professional guidance before opening the ride.

Mr Bristow said the park used a voluntary Heath and Safety Executive-approved scheme of safety inspections. An expert passed the zipwire to open.

Andrea Bristow, the co-owner of Green Wood Forest Park. Managing director Stephen Bristow said the mistake should have been spotted during safety checks

Mr Bristow said it wasn't a legal requirement to have an inspection. 'We get the best advice we can find,' he said.

He said there was 'top-quality equipment' and staff were trained to check it.

The coroner said the delay in holding an inquest was because of the investigation by the police and Crown Prosecution Service.

The hearing continues.
