A 20-year-old thief has paid the price for being friends with his mother on Facebook after she gave him an embarrassing dressing down for stealing a woman's jewellery.

Cleaner Charlie Cooper complained on the social networking site that his human rights had been breached when his photo was printed  in a local newspaper next to a report on his court appearance.

But he was left red-faced after his 
mother waded into the argument and told him off for stealing jewellery 
from an innocent woman.

Embarrassing: Charlie Cooper, 20, pictured left, paid the price for being friends with his mother Teresa, pictured with him right, on Facebook after she told him off for complaining about his photo being published in a local newspaper next to a report on his court case for theft

Complaint: Charlie Cooper left this message on the Facebook page of the Herne Bay Gazette after they printed his picture - accusing the newspaper of breaching his human rights

Cooper, from Kent, wrote on Facebook that the Herne Bay Gazette had not asked his permission to print the photo.

In a statement on the 
newspaper’s Facebook page, which contained several spelling errors, he wrote: 'Well done guys, im having to watch my back every time I go out now, 
thanks to the idiots at the gazzette im getting threats left right and 
center, I know what I did was wrong but you didnt ask me if you could 
take a picture and put it in the papers, I know the public have a right 
to know but.i have my human rights, and now they have been breached, 
thanks guys well done'. 

His mother Teresa responded to his remarks, telling him he didn’t have a right to complain as he had committed the crime.

Telling off: But the 20-year-old's mother Teresa told him off for complaining - pointing out he shouldn't have committed the crime in the first place

Determined: Despite his mother's advice, Cooper continued to defend his Facebook complaint, saying he didn't want his picture taken

She wrote: 'They don’t need your permission to take your picture if the courts have given them permission to be there to do so.'

He replied: 'They do, I dont want my picture taken. End of.'

But it was a case of mother-knows-best when she had the final say and told him: 'It done now. That lady didn’t want her jewellery taking but you did it anyway, end of.'

The row prompted Cooper to block his mother on the social networking website.

Argument: Mrs Cooper and her son continued to debate the newspaper's use of his picture until he tells his mother he is blocking her on Facebook

He angrily posted: 'This is why I didnt have you on facebook mum, you say things like that, im blocking you ok.!'.

Undeterred,
she replied: 'Its the truth charlie, you dont like the truth, until you
realise things like this you will never learn ok.'

Crime: Cooper stole jewellery worth £1,500 from Vandra Henderson while working with his father to clean her home

Canterbury Magistrates Court last 
week heard Cooper stole the jewellery worth £1,500 from Vandra 
Henderson, in Whitstable, last year, to fuel his drink 
and drugs habit.

Prosecutor Julie Farbrace said Mrs Henderson, who is in her late 50s, had her home cleaned every two weeks by Cooper’s father.

Cooper helped his father in October and November and at the time the jewellery went missing.

The home owner alerted police, who discovered that Cooper had sold the pieces to a jeweller in Margate. Magistrates told him he had let his family down.

Chairman of the bench Carole Kincaid said: 'This was a very serious offence in which there was a breach of trust.

'The jewellery you stole not only had a financial value, but also a sentimental value. You have also let your family down.'

Cooper drank up to two bottles of wine a day and took party drug MDMA, the court was told.

'This was not part of a long course of offending,' Nigel Numas, defending, said.

'At the time he was suffering from problems with drink and drugs. He was drinking two bottles of wine a day and taking MDMA.'

Magistrates gave Cooper a 12-month community order with 240 hours unpaid work. He must pay £1,519 in compensation to Mrs Henderson, plus £85 prosecution costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
