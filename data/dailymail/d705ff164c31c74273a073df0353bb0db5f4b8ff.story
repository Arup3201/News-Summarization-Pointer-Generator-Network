Tens of thousands of U.S. college students are flocking to the Mexican city of Cancun this years rather than travel to other popular tourist hotspots, which have been deemed too dangerous.

City officials said Friday that they expected thousands more visitors than the 25,000 who came to the Caribbean coast resort last year.

They said at least part of that boost in visitors could be attributed to people avoiding Pacific Coast resorts such as Acapulco, which have been hit by high-profile incidents of criminal violence in recent years.

Cancun tourism director Maximo Garcia Rocha said some major tourist agencies were expecting as many as 43,000 spring breakers, but the major influx was only beginning Friday.

The Cancun Hotel Association said occupancy was at 90 per cent citywide.

With vacationers arriving en masse in Cancun, local officials have stepped up patrols of marines, soldiers and special tourist police in zones packed with hotels and bars.

Brad Madani, a 24-year-old from Toronto, said he had come to Cancun for the second time and was drawn by the beaches, discos and bikini contests.

While many Canadians think Mexico is dangerous, Madani said, he felt safe in Cancun, particularly with the heavy presence of marines.

Speaking in halting Spanish, he added, ‘Hay muchas chiquitas bonita,’ or "There are many pretty girls."

Garcia said city authorities were distributing flyers at the 10 main spring break hotels giving numbers for the U.S. Consulate and advising spring breakers not to drink or urinate in the streets, use drugs, start disturbances or destroy property.

While some risk management companies have attempted to change the image of Mexico as a crime-ravaged country, it appears that the travelers’ fears are not unfounded.

Mexico is on the U.S. State Department ‘Current Travel Warnings’ list. Diamante, the popular tourist area where six Spanish women were tied up with their bikinis, raped and robbed last month, ‘has been less affected by violence,’ according to the State Department's website.

The Obama administration issued a travel warning in November 2012, noting that resort areas and tourist destinations generally do not see the levels of violence and crime reported in other areas of Mexico, but ‘crime and violence are serious problems throughout the country and can occur anywhere,’ NBC reported.

The website lists general and state-specific security information. Due to the number of kidnappings and disappearances in Mexico, it advises travelers to ‘lower your profile and avoid displaying any evidence of wealth that might draw attention.’

For the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located, avoiding non-essential travel in certain areas, and best times of day and routes to travel are addressed. Tourists in certain cities, including Acapulco ‘should exercise caution and stay with in tourist areas.’

This year, Cancun was found to be the number one destination for students looking to enjoy the typically wild week-long holiday, which got to an early start in February.

'Spring break is a week of rest and relaxation. You get away from tests, midterms, homework, work, anything,' Sean Wells, a Senior at Indiana State University told wthitv.com.

Students certainly seem a long way from homework if the images which typically emerge from the resort are anything to go by.

Hundreds of young revelers tend to be snapped in shorts and bikinis knocking back cocktails on the beach, in the hotel pools or worse for wear in the bars and on the dance-floor.  

And it doesn't look likely to calm down this year.

In January, student travel agency STA reported the city was the most popular in terms of student travelers followed by Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and Puerta Vallarta also in Mexico.

As student advice website Student 
City says, visitors shouldn't be expecting a quiet time: 'In Cancun, the
party never stops, so you may want to choose your spring 
break hotel based on the noise-level. Chances are that if you don't 
choose a quiet one, you'll just be up for 7 days straight. And that may 
not be a bad thing for some of you.'

Jesus
Almagauer, chief executive of the Cancun Convention and Visitors 
Bureau, said Cancun was not a city struggling to keep the peace.

'Last
year Cancun welcomed almost 4 million visitors, and while none of our 
tourists were victims of violent crimes, we understand that safety is 
always a concern when traveling to a foreign country,' he told the LA Times.

'In
response to that concern, and in an effort to dispel any misconceptions
about the destination, we always amplify our security protocol during 
peak travel times to ensure the safety of every person visiting us. 
[Cancun] has better safety records than most major U.S. cities.'  

Last
year the Department for Public Safety in Texas sparked a row with 
Mexican authorities for advising against travel to the resort - for the 
third year running.

They said violence between rival drug gangs as well as other crime posed safety issues for tourists.

'The Mexican government has made great strides 
battling the cartels, and we commend their continued commitment to 
making Mexico a safer place to live and visit,' Texas Department of 
Public Safety Director Steve McCraw said.

'However, drug cartel violence
and other criminal activity represent a significant safety threat, even
in some resort areas.'

'Many crimes against Americans in Mexico go unpunished,' he added.

Officials in Mexico described the state's stance as 'outrageous'.

Rodolfo Lopez Negrete, chief operating officer of the Mexico Tourism 
Board, said: 'This warning is exceptionally aggressive. To paint Mexico with such a massively broad brush stroke is 
simply outrageous.'

For most students the week off for Spring Break typically comes in March but some colleges offer the week in February.
