Childhood diabetes has spiraled out of control and experts fear it might be years until they catch up on just how rapidly the problem is spreading.

New figures show instances of Type-2 diabetes in children and teenagers spiked a drastic 30 per cent between 2000 and 2009, and there are fears the problem has gotten a lot worse in the untracked period in the five years since.

The complications arising from diabetes means those children affected face 'a lifetime burden', the study's author warned.

Obesity is typically associated with childhood diabetes - which carries associated health risks such as heart attacks and organ failure

Experts fear the problem may have gotten even worse in the five years since the latest figures were tracked

New figures released today show that 0.46 in every 1,000 kids is affected by Type-2 - with more than 20,000 sufferers across the U.S. - while the cases of Type-1 diabetes is up 21 per cent to 167,000 children.

The research was presented at a Pediatric Academic Societies conference in Vancouver by Dana Dabelea, from the Colorado School of Public Health in Aurora, who authored the study.

'These increases are serious,' she said, according to USA Today.

'Every new case means a lifetime burden of difficult and costly treatment and higher risk of early, serious complications.'

Nearly 10 per cent of the entire U.S. population - 25.8 million people - is affected by diabetes.

Obesity expert David Ludwig, from the Boston Children's Hospital, says the gap in tracked data since 2009 has caused the industry concern that things are getting worse.

'We don't know what happened in the last five years,' he said.

'Most likely, things have gotten worse.'

The spike in Type-2 diabetes among children is particularly concerning because it's traditionally referred to as 'adult-onset' diabetes and usually only affects people over the age of 40.

And most children who do suffer from it are already obese, experts say, meaning they are facing an array of health problems including heart attacks and organ failure.
