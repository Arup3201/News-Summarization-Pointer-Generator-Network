The brains behind the no-makeup selfie phenomenon which is sweeping social media and has raised £8 million - and counting - for a cancer charity has been revealed to be a teenage mother.

Fiona Cunningham, 18, encouraged people to donate cash along with their selfies after actress Kim Novak kicked off the craze when she appeared bare-faced at the Oscars.

The young mother-of-one set up a Facebook page from her bedroom in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, and encouraged people to post no-makeup selfies while donating cash to Cancer Research UK.

Where it all began: Fiona Cunningham, 18, is the creator of the Facebook #nomakeupselfie page with nearly 250,000 followers

Incredibly, just days after creating the page on March 18 she received a staggering 260,000 'likes' from supporters across the globe.

Fiona, who is studying for a degree in criminal psychology with the Open University, was flooded with selfies from around the world and she recruited 12 friends to sort through each picture and upload it to Facebook.

Just four days after launching her Facebook group, Cancer Research UK proudly announced they had received £2million in donations as a direct result of the no-makeup selfie campaign.

Fiona, who lives with her fiance Carl Cook, 26, and their one-year-old son Jenson, decided to raise awareness for the disease after losing close family members to cancer.

She said: 'I read an article about Kim Novak’s decision not to wear makeup at the Oscars.

'The no-makeup selfie craze really captured my imagination and I was amazed at the response from people around the world and just thought how great it would be if it could be done for charity.

'After seeing nothing similar on Facebook or Twitter, I thought there was something in it that it could raise awareness of cancer.

'Initially I was just going to try and raise awareness for breast cancer, but it just became all cancer and that is even better.

Overwhelming response: Fiona was flooded with selfies from around the world and she recruited 12 friends to sort through each picture

'A few of my family members have had breast cancer and unfortunately one of them didn’t make it.

'Carl’s grandma also passed away from it so therefore it is quite close to home for us. I set up the Facebook group and encouraged to send in their selfies with a hasthtag linking it to Cancer Research UK.

'I thought a few people would join in and donate money, mainly my friends, but I was shocked when the page went global.

'I had to get some of my friends in to help me administrate the page straight away, it was just unbelievable.

'I was working around the clock just trying to keep up with the pictures coming in from everywhere. I’m overwhelmed and still think I must be dreaming. I’m just very proud and it’s thanks to everyone that it’s been so successful.

Celebrity support: (L-R) Katherine Jenkins, Katy Perry, Jodie Marsh, Lady Gaga, Kate Lawler and Katie Piper have all jumped on board

'So many women wear makeup and none of us really need it. The women who have done it are all so brave in a world that expects us all to wear makeup constantly.'

Carl, a team manager at Vodafone, added: 'It’s absolutely crazy how it’s taken off. Fiona has put a lot of work to make it a success and I’m so proud of her.

'The money that has been raised is incredible and it’s had a fantastic response. We want to thank everyone who has got involved.'

A spokesman for Cancer Research UK said: 'It’s brilliant it’s raising so much money. It’s totally unexpected because it wasn’t something we planned.

'The fact that people have chosen to donate to us has been quite overwhelming. Just putting out a Facebook post that says text us, the fact that people actually did take that action, has been so overwhelming.

'It’s great to see people getting involved.'

And it's not just women getting involved - men are painting on the slap in support of Prostate Cancer UK.

A spokesperson for the charity said: 'This is what our campaign Men United is all about - men using their camaraderie and creativity to do something individually and together about a killer disease. 

'In this case, they’re using  humour to raise awareness and funds, but also to get the vital conversations going about prostate cancer.

'Phil Richman was inspired to start this slap-up idea because someone close to him put off going to the doctor until it was too late. It is fantastic that social networking is being used so positively and we are still seeing money roll in.

'Men United took its inspiration from the fantastic success of the breast cancer awareness campaign and it’s no surprise that women have inspired men again here. Making up is hard to do for a bloke - but it’s in a great cause.'

Getting in on the action: Celebrities such as Coleen Rooney and Rylan Clark - who posted a photo of himself in support of Prostate Cancer UK - have joined in

Two sisters have become the oldest Brits to Tweet a no makeup selfie for charity - with a combined age of 174.

Great-granmothers May Race, 93, and Brenda Page, 81, took a joint picture of their bare faces and each donated £5 to Cancer Research UK.

Brenda, a retired receptionist, said they had done it because they had lost loved ones including their sister Ann to cancer.

She said: 'We'd never heard of a selfie before but it was all a lot of fun. I have certainly never taken one before. We're not well up with those things, you see.

'I had to concentrate while I was pressing the button, so my sister has a bigger smile than me. It was a bit iffy but huge fun.

'I never wore makeup even when I was younger so that part didn't bother me. But May was always one for wearing it.

'It's a cause that's close to our hearts so we thought we'd have a laugh and go for it.'

May and Brenda, from Heacham, Norfolk, are from a family of nine siblings and between them have 11 children, 23 grandchildren, 29 great-grandchildren, and four great-great-grandchildren.

Jane Redman of Cancer Research UK said: 'We can't say for certain, but we're pretty sure May and Brenda are the oldest people to post a selfie as part of the #nomakeupselfie trend.

'Thanks to people choosing to donate to us we've been overwhelmed with donations and support in the past 48 hours. We've raised over £8m so far, and the £nomakeupselfie is still going strong.

'The trend isn't something Cancer Research UK started so it's been fantastic to see so many people getting involved and wanting to use their selfie to raise money for our life-saving research.'
