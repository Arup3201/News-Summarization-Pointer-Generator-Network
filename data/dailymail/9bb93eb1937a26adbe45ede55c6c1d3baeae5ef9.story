The financial crash saw average working families suffer a £1,700 real terms cut in their income, new figures reveal today.

But the same time retired households on middle incomes saw their income rise by more than £900, despite the turmoil on the stock markets triggered by the global banking crisis.

The Office for National Statistics said private pensions increased markedly from 2007 onwards, while those in work saw wage cuts or freezes.

Since the financial crash in 2007-08,m incomes of working households (green line) has fallen, while the incomes of retired households (purple line) has risen)

The Office for National Statistics said payouts from private pensions have risen markedly, driving up incomes (at 2011-12 prices)

New analysis shows how the so-called ‘median household income’ of average families rises and falls in line with the prospects of the wider economy.

Households saw incomes rise as the economy grew, but fell after the recessions of the early 1980s, early 1990s and late 2000s.

Between 2007-08 when before the financial crisis and latest figures for 2011-12, the median income for working households fell by 6.4 per cent from £27,053 to £25,671 at 2011-12 prices.

However the median income for retired households grew by 5.1 per cent over the same period, to £19,253 in 2011-12.

Average direct taxes paid by the middle fifth of non-retired households have fallen from £8,700 in
2007-08 to £6,800 in 2011-12

The ONS said: ‘The largest driver of this increase was income from private pensions, which grew by 22 per cent.

‘This was partly due to more recently retired people receiving higher incomes from private pensions, on average.

‘The other source of growth over this period was the State Pension which grew by 9 per cent for the middle fifth of retired households.’

All households have seen incomes rise in real terms in the last three decades.

In 1977 the average household income was the equivalent of £11,200 in today’s prices, compared to £23,200 in 2011-12.

The median household income grew by 2.2 per cent on average every year.

Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use his Autumn Statement on Thursday to ease the pressure on squeezed family finances.

He
is under pressure from some Tories including former Defence Secretary 
Liam Fox to offer tax cuts, to allow people to keep more of the money 
they earn.

But Mr Osborne 
has played down the prospect of significant tax cuts or extra spending 
commitments as he promised to deliver a 'responsible recovery'.

Labour's shadow treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: 'These figures show that disposable incomes for the average working-age household fell by over £1,500 a year in David Cameron’s first two years in Downing Street.

'And after three damaging years of flatlining the cost-of-living crisis under this Government continues as prices are still rising much faster than wages.

'That’s why we need action in the Autumn Statement to tackle the rising cost of living and ensure we can earn our way to higher living standards for all and not just a few at the top.

'But with energy bills still rising this winter after the Government’s announcements, David Cameron and George Osborne look set to fail the test.'
