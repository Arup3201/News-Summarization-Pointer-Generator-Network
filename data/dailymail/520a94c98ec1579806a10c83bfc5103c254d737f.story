Elche midfielder Carlos Sanchez is expected to jet into England on Tuesday to complete a £4.7million switch to Aston Villa.

The 28-year-old defensive midfielder - who is nicknamed The Rock - is due to arrive in the Midlands to sign a four-year deal.

The Colombia international has been identified by Villa boss Paul Lambert as the man he wants to add some bite to his midfield.

And barring a last minute hitch, the Villa boss looks to have secured Sanchez’s capture ahead of the Barclays Premier League opener against Stoke on Saturday.

Sanchez has spent the vast majority of his career playing in France, spending seven years with Valenciennes before moving to Spain in 2013.

He has made 30 La Liga appearances for Elche, but he is now poised to leave for England.

Villa hope the deal can be completed by Tuesday night or at the latest on Wednesday morning.

Sanchez will undergo his medical at Villa's Bodymoor Heath training complex in the coming days, with the club hopeful of completing the deal soon after.

No work permit issues are expected given his international experience, which extends to 48 caps for Colombia including all four games at the World Cup in Brazil.

But he is not expected to go straight into the squad for Saturday's match at Stoke because he has not yet trained with Lambert's group.

Elche want Swansea midfielder Jose Canas to fill the void left by Sanchez.
