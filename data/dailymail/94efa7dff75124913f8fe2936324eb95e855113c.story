A 15-year-old boy has been rushed to hospital after allegedly being stabbed at school by another student, police said.

Officers were called to Eggbuckland Community College - the school that Olympic diver Tom Daley left in 2009 because of constant bullying - in Plymouth, Devon, at 8.40am today to reports a student had been wounded.

The boy was taken to Derriford Hospital with a back injury and has since been discharged.

Police arrested a 14-year-old boy, also a student at the school, on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Daley left the technology college when he was 14-years-old after suffering constant bullying there, claiming he was called names such as ‘Speedo boy’. He also said he received threats from other students who said they would ‘break his legs’.

Superintendent Chris Singer, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said today that the suspect had been taken into police custody.

He said: 'We are investigating the circumstances of this incident and would like to reassure people that there is no danger to anyone else.

'The alleged weapon that was used has been seized and the suspect has been arrested.'

In a statement on their website, the school said: 'Before College today, there was a completely random, unprovoked and unprecedented incident involving two of our students which resulted in an injury.

'He was immediately taken to hospital and has since been discharged and is now currently at home with his family. Everyone at the college wishes him a speedy recovery.'

They said the principal has been in regular contact with the parents of both boys involved in the incident and messages have been posted to the school's social media feeds to reassure students.

'The parents of those students who witnessed the incident have been notified and appropriate professional support and care is being provided for the small number of students affected,' the statement said.

'The Devon and Cornwall Police are involved in this matter so we are unable to comment further on the nature of the incident.'

On their Facebook page they posted: 'Just to reassure students and parents that there was an incident here this morning which was dealt with very swiftly by staff.

'One boy was taken to hospital and is fine. A second boy is being interviewed by police. We have already contacted the parents of those who witnessed the incident.'

Daley told the Plymouth Herald in 2009 that the bullying at school started after the Beijing Olympics and got increasingly worse.

He said: 'I'd always ignored the "diver boy" or "Speedo boy" comments when I came back from Beijing last year, hoping they'd get fed up and stop.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
