Most women are put off dieting by pictures of celebrities such as Michelle Keegan and Elle Macpherson flaunting their perfect bikini bodies, according to new research.

Far from being inspired to get in shape too by beach pictures of their favourite celebrities, the images have the opposite effect - with 62 per cent of women saying they are actually less inclined to diet after seeing them.

More than half (54 per cent) say they are more likely to ‘give up’ rather than lose weight because they realise they will never be able to get the body they really desire.

And a further 57 per cent moaned that even when they do lose weight, they are disappointed with their pictures taken on holiday because they appear fatter than they had hoped.

The celebrity who does most to stop women dieting is ex-Coronation Street favourite Michelle Keegan, whose barmaid character Tina McIntyre was recently killed off in the soap.

The second biggest diet killer is Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden, followed by supermodel Elle Macpherson - still looking fabulous at 50 - Miranda Kerr and Gwyneth Paltrow.

The survey also revealed that a staggering 85 per cent of women admitted to looking at pictures of stars on the beach via the media.

We'll never compare! The survey found that over half of women say they are more likely to 'give up' rather than lose weight because they realise they will never be able to get the body they really desire, with Elle Macpherson being one such example

A further 72 per cent consciously compared the celebrities’ bodies with their own and 64 per cent of women said they ended up feeling ‘deflated’ when they compared stars’ bodies to their own.

This feeling of deflation rose to 84 per cent when the star was the same age or older than the real woman viewing the image.

The vast majority of women (71 per cent) reckon air-brushed pictures of celebrities looking perfect on the beach give real women unrealistic role models to aspire to.

Most women (82 per cent) would prefer the celebrities’ beach pictures to be seen unaltered - just like real women’s holiday snaps.

A spokesperson for Forza supplements, who commissioned the research, said: 'It’s no surprise that women find the "perfect" pictures of Michelle Keegan and other celebrities such as Elle Macpherson and Gwyenth Patrow a bit depressing.

'How can real women, without personal trainers and macrobiotic diets, hope to compete?

'The truth is they can’t and they shouldn’t. They have far more important things to do like getting on with their careers and running their families.'

Will we ever look like them? The vast majority of women reckon air-brushed pictures of celebrities looking perfect give real women unrealistic role models to aspire to
