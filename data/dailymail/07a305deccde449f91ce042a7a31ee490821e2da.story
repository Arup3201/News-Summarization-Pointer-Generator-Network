Christopher Columbus was from Ibiza, politicians on the Spanish party isle have claimed.

The bizarre theory, which they admit they cannot categorically prove, is based largely on the fact that the fabled 15th century explorer had the same handwriting as Ibizans of the time.

And now, politicians have vowed to re-brand the island - better known for booze-cruise Brits, all-night clubbing and hard-core house music - as the home of America's discoverer.

Ibiza calling: The bizarre theory apparently disproves the widespread belief that Christopher Columbus was either Italian, Portuguese, or from Galicia in the north-west of Spain

That is despite them acknowledging that they cannot prove the theory, espoused by self-styled investigative journalist Nito Verdera, is 100 per cent accurate.

They also admit they truly cannot verify whether Columbus was born on the island, or even if he lived there for any period of time whatsoever.

But councillors voted unanimously yesterday to formally advertise the hypothesis that Columbus was the son of merchants who had a house in Dalt Vila, the medieval area of Ibiza Town.

It came with one condition - that it did not cost taxpayers' on the White Isle a single Euro.

The claim has been met with widespread scepticism, with many taking to Twitter to say it is simply a publicity stunt to attract tourists to Ibiza's cash-strapped holiday resorts.

But Verdera, who claims to have worked as a merchant sailor and pilot, insisted that the seafarer had a 'geocultural origin' from the island.

And the self-styled journalist's alleged 50 years of work had apparently disproved the widespread belief that Columbus was either Italian, Portuguese, or from Galicia in the north-west of Spain.

Verdera's theory was backed by opposition political party Nova Alternativa, whose councillor Antonio Villalonga originally proposed the motion.

He told 20minutos.es that the theory 'was fundamentally sound, based on historic and linguistic studies.'

He pointed to the way Columbus has used coastal names from the Balearic islands in naming areas in the Carribean - for example Caragoler, Punta de la Mata and Punta de la Rama.

Another indication, he said, was Columbus' writing style could be traced back to Ibizan residents.

Villalonga added: 'Even though there could be an error, everything points to this being true. It's just to give someone who did something amazing the correct recognition.'

He said there were many ways in which the new found origin of Columbus could be exploited, but that it would not see the council spending much money.

He said: The council will not spend €50,000 in books, but if it could spend €500 on a walking trail through his family home then that could happen.'

Party isle to Caribbean isle: It is claimed that Columbus was in fact from Ibiza Town, in Ibiza, off the coast of Spain. Born in 1451, he sailed to the New World in search of the Orient in 1492, but landed in the Bahamas

Columbus heroically led his crew into the unknown as he set sail for the New World on a voyage of discovery in 1492.

He was in fact trying to find a westward sea passage to the Orient when he stumbled across the Americas.

Born between August and October 1451, Columbus was the son of a weaver and small-time 
merchant.

As a teenager, Christopher went to sea, and is believed to have travelled extensively before finally making Portugal his base.

It was here that he initially 
attempted to gain royal patronage for 
his 'enterprise of the Indies'.

Finally he persuaded King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella to sponsor the 
expedition and, on 3 August 1492, Columbus and his fleet of three ships,
the Santa Maria, the Pinta and the Niña, set sail across the Atlantic.

Ten days later they came ashore in the Bahamas.

He went on to land on a series of other islands in the Caribbean, including Cuba and
Hispaniola, and returned to Spain in triumph where he was made 'admiral of 
the Seven Seas' and viceroy of the Indies.

Despite his successes, he has been blamed by some historians for bringing syphilis back to Europe.
