Deborah Poulton was three times over the alcohol limit when she was caught at the wheel with her daughter sat beside her

A mother who was swigging vodka at the wheel of a car with her baby daughter sat next to her was three times over the drink-drive limit, a court has heard. 

Deborah Poulton was pulled over by police after being reported by another driver for dangerous driving.

Poulton’s car was spotted weaving across a road before mounting the kerb, narrowly missing a cyclist.

When police stopped the 38-year-old, they found her 13-month-old daughter strapped into a car seat of the Fiat Seicento, the court was told.

Poulton, from Poole, Dorset, was arrested after a roadside breath test revealed she had 103 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, three times the legal limit.

The baby was picked up by her father.

Poulton pleaded guilty to drink driving at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court and now faces a minimum 12-month driving ban, up to six months in prison and a fine of up to £5,000.

A separate charge of being drunk in charge of a child was dropped.

Heather Jackson, prosecuting, said that earlier the same day staff at a nearby Co-op store had reported Poulton for drunken behaviour.

She said: 'She went to visit a friend during the day, then left her daughter with her friend to drive to the Co-op to buy cigarette papers and wine.

'In her car was a Lucozade bottle containing vodka from which she was drinking. The police received a call about her demeanour from the store - she had slurred speech.

'She returned to her friend’s address in the car and consumed the bottle of Lucozade and vodka.

'Poulton then left with her daughter in the car, almost crashing several times.'

Mark Proctor, mitigating, said Poulton’s drinking had 'spiralled out of control' and that she hid alcohol in her car so her boyfriend did not know she had it.

He said: 'She turned to alcohol as a means to deal with other issues in her life.

'She hadn’t felt under the influence of alcohol when she got into the car.

'She was very forthcoming in her interview with the police and very apologetic for her actions.'

Poulton will be sentenced on June 10.
