She shot to fame when she was runner-up on the Apprentice - and has since become infamous for hitting the town in skin-tight dresses. But Luisa Zissman has admitted that she isn't as body confident as people might believe.

The insecure 26-year-old entrepreneur has admitted that she had a range of 
'body issues' after failing to shift what she dubs her 'mummy tummy' and 'unsightly love handles' since she gave birth to her daughter three years ago.

Being labelled 'fat' by online bullies after her Marbella holiday photos surfaced in August was the final straw, and the mother-of-one set about shifting the pounds.

New body: Apprentice runner-up Luisa Zissman has revealed how her body hang-ups led her to embark on a serious weight loss regime and she even turned to diet pills

She said: 'I thought I looked a bit
fat in the gold bikini pictures of me. I saw myself and thought, "I'm 
going to tone up".'

Luisa explained that in the past her weight had yoyo-ed from anywhere between 9st 3lb at her heaviest to 8st 2lb at her lightest.

She said: 'Like every woman, I have a 
lot of body issues. I'm really curvy, but I don't really like my hips or
love handles.

'I've got a really small waist - but there's a 10-12 inch 
difference between my waist and my hips, which is huge.'

Motherhood added
to those insecurities: Luisa put on three-and-a-half-stone when she was
pregnant with daughter, Dixie and struggled for years to get her figure back.

To regain 
confidence, she had a breast enhancement.

'When you are pregnant you can
lose sight of who you are and, for me, getting a boob job was part of 
being me again.

Fluctuating: Luisa explained that in the past her weight had yoyo-ed from anywhere between 9st 3lb at her heaviest to 8st 2lb at her lightest - she is finally happy with her current body

'My boobs had turned into empty sacks after my pregnancy,
so I had them boosted from 32C to a 32E,' she explained.

But she was still left with 
what she calls a 'jelly belly.'

She said: 'I was unhappy with how my 
stomach looked from having a baby – I had a bit of a jelly belly.

'I 
always keep a close eye on my weight and it can fluctuate quite a lot. I can go anywhere from just over 9st to 8st 2lb, which is my ideal 
weight.'

Luisa has now hit her target weight thanks to her new exercise and healthy eating regime.

She has been doing home workout sessions - quick 30 minute work-out sessions which combine squat thrusts, burpees, leg raises crunches and press ups.

Finally happy: Luisa put on three-and-a-half-stone when she was pregnant with daughter, Dixie - and struggled for years to get her figure back, but now, at 8st 2lbs, is happy with her body

She will switch body parts on 
alternate days, so legs and abs Monday, chest and arms Wednesday, Cardio
Friday and she takes the weekend off.

She
has been sticking to a high-protein, low-carb diet, with porridge or fresh 
fruit and Greek yoghurt in the mornings, soup for lunch and a fish or 
chicken with no skin and salad for an early evening meal.

She has also imposed a 'carb curfew' at around 6.30pm and will have very little to eat after that time.

She has cut out all fruit juices and tries to drink two litres of water a day, and has only green tea as a hot drink.

Her danger time, however, comes at around 4pm when she has cravings for snacks 
so her only option was to turn to diet pills to curb the cravings.

She said: 'I'm a snacker at heart so I'll usually 
pick at anything that's around me. But when I take a Forza Raspberry 
Ketone in the morning and afternoon, my snacking habits are curbed.

'They are like willpower in pill form. I feel more energised and
taking the capsules has not really affected my lifestyle at all. I 
have lost the weight despite still being partial to the odd cake.'

Fans of the diet pills include Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Roxanne Pallett and Spencer Matthews.

Madeleine Shaw, a nutritionist who works with Millie Mackintosh, said: 'I think eating a wholefood diet is the most important thing.

'Adding supplements is great but if you still stuffing your face with pizza then you won't be able to be the healthiest version of you.

Insecure: The 26-year-old entrepreneur has admitted that she had a range of 'body issues' after failing to shift what she describes as her 'mummy tummy' and 'unsightly love handles'

'The problem with supplements is our body doesn't recognise them as well, we absorb food best in its whole form.'

Cassandra
Barns, nutritional therapist at The Nutri Centre, added: 'Raspberry 
ketones are a popular ingredient for weight loss – they are thought to 
work by increasing breakdown of fat (lipolysis) and the burning of fats 
for energy (thermogenesis).

'One
ingredient that may be more controversial in this product is caffeine: 
while it can stimulate the metabolism and assist weight loss in some 
individuals, it can be too stimulating for some people, causing or 
exacerbating anxiety and insomnia.

'It is also thought that caffeine may exacerbate weight problems in some people, especially those who are "apple-shape".'

'I feel great. I lost my target weight of a stone and I am now at my idea weight of 8st 2lb,' added Luisa.
