Drivers in China will have to think twice before they break the speed limit in Shanghai, after a staggering 60 CCTV cameras were installed on just one stretch of road.

Government officials have been criticised after fitting the mointors to cover the two-lane Youyi Road, even though it is not deemed to be a dangerous area.

The excessive surveillance has led to allegations that public money has been squandered after images of the two beams covered in devices were posted on social media.

Excessive: The cameras were installed on two beams above Youyi Road in Shanghai

Surveillance: The devices are likely to act as a deterrent to motorists, despite the controversy

Criticised: Government officials, who did not coordinate when the cameras were being installed, have been accused of wasting public money and overkill

Local officials initially declined to comment on why there was so many cameras monitoring drivers.

But it later turned out that the cameras had all been put up by a range of departments, none of which had taken the time to find out whether there were already cameras in place.

The police, local traffic monitoring departments, the weather bureau, the tourism board and a dozen other bodies, including those responsible for testing the surveillance technology, had all installed their own devices.

Safe: The monitors cover each side of the road, despite the fact it has not been deemed as dangerous

Justification: An engineer from the company who operates the cameras claimed they were fitted for testing

The cameras, installed close to an intersection, had been fitted on two arms stretching across each side of the road.

A spokeswoman for the Shenzhen-based Launch Digital Technology, a surveillance equipment manufacturer who provides devices to the government, defended the move saying that it was quite common to have more than one camera fitted in order to cover blind spots and handle a large volume of traffic.

It was revealed that Baokang Electronic, a manufacturer of signals used by the police, owned the devices.

Company engineer Xue Xiaogang said: 'They are installed for testing. Only a few of them are cameras, many are various kinds of flashlights to allow cameras to operate in the dark.'

Concerns: People who saw the photos online said the cameras should be spread around the city and not isolated in one place
