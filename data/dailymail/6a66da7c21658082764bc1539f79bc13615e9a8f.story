Former Home Secretary Leon Brittan this morning said he asked officials to look carefully at a dossier handed to him in the 1980s allegedly containing claims of a Westminster paedophile network.

The Tory peer released a statement after he was challenged to make public what he knew about the file handed to him at the time by a fellow Conservative MP.

Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, told the Home Affairs Select Committee that Lord Brittan had been sent a dossier of allegations about paedophiles between 1983 and 1985 by Geoff Dickens MP.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk called for a Hillsborough style inquiry into historic child abuse sex allegations. He said Leon Brittan, who was Home Secretary in the 1980s should share his knowledge about a dossier sent to Whitehall detailing allegations of a Westminster paedophile ring

Lord Brittan this morning said he had received the dossier during his time as Home Secretary. He said he had asked officials to look into the claims, but did 'not recall being contacted further about these matters'. 

In a statement released through his lawyer, Lord Brittan said: 'During my time as Home Secretary (1983 to 1985), Geoff Dickens MP arranged to see me at the Home Office. I invariably agreed to see any MP who requested a meeting with me.

'As I recall, he came to my room at the Home Office with a substantial bundle of papers. As is normal practice, my Private Secretary would have been present at the meeting.

'I told Mr Dickens that I would ensure that the papers were looked at carefully by the Home Office and acted on as necessary.

'Following the meeting, I asked my officials to look carefully at the material contained in the papers provided and report back to me if they considered that any action needed to be taken by the Home Office.

'In addition I asked my officials to consider a referral to another Government Department, such as the Attorney General's Department, if that was appropriate.

'This was the normal procedure for handling material presented to the Home Secretary. I do not recall being contacted further about these matters by Home Office officials or by Mr Dickens or by anyone else.'

In a second statement released by Mr Brittan, he clariffied what happened to the dossier.

He said: 'In the last hour I have been alerted to a Home Office independent review conducted last year into what information it received about organised child sex abuse between 1979 and 1999.

'The review found information had been dealt with properly. It also disclosed that material received from Mr Dickens in November 1983 and January 1984 had not been retained.

'However, a letter was sent from myself to Mr Dickens on March 20, 1984 explaining what had been done in relation to the files.'

Lord Brittan's statements today came after Labour MP Mr Danczuk told a Parliamentary committee yesterday that he believed politics was the 'last refuge of child sex abuse deniers'.

He repeated his call for a Hillsborough-style inquiry into historical paedophile allegations.

 Affairs Select Committee after accusing the late Liberal MP Sir Cyril 
Smith for Rochdale (pictured) of being a paedophile

Lord Brittan said last night that he would be issuing a statement at lunchtime today 'about the handling of such papers in the Home Office'. Mr Danczuk helped expose the full extent of Liberal MP Cyril Smith's paedophile attacks in a book earlier this year, serialised in the Daily Mail.

The call for an inquiry into how Smith, the former Rochdale MP, and other high-profile paedophiles such as Jimmy Savile evaded justice for so long has now gained the support of 120 MPs.  

Mr Danczuk said a public inquiry would shed light on what was known about prominent paedophiles, and what the police and senior politicians did about it.

He told the Commons home affairs select committee that he believed a series of home secretaries had questions to answer over what they had heard about allegations of paedophilia in high places. 

He said the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens had written to Lord Brittan, Home Secretary from 1983 to 1985, about paedophiles 'operating and networking within and around Westminster'.  

'I do think it would be helpful for Sir Leon Brittan to share his knowledge of how he dealt with these allegations that were made at the time,' said Mr Danczuk.

'I think that politics is the last refuge of child sex abuse deniers. Other institutions, the police, have dealt with this and changed their culture.'

But politics suffered from 'a continual view that we should sweep it under the carpet, that we shouldn't speak about it, that we shouldn't name people, that there shouldn't be a discussion about what's gone on'.  

Lord Brittan (pictured at his London home) was elevated to the Lords in 
2000 after a fifteen years in the Commons and 10 years at the European 
Commission. He was also knighted in 1989

Mr Danczuk said he had faced pressure not to name those allegedly involved in sexual abuse and said only an inquiry could 'bring all the different strands together'.

'I don't have all the answers, but we have to understand why the authorities failed to investigate such high-profile cases,' he said.

Earlier this year, Mr Danczuk published a book into Smith's decades of abuse of young children, including at Knowl View school where he was a governor.

A number of suspects have been identified and the MP said he understood from police that arrests were 'imminent'.

In 1976 Smith wrote to the BBC criticising its investigations into the 'private lives of certain MPs'. The politician, who died in 2010, expressed 'deep concern' about a probe into an alleged campaign to discredit members of parliament.

At the time the media had been investigating claims that South African secret agents had been trying to smear British MPs.

In another letter, he urged the then Home Secretary, Merlyn Rees, to ensure the BBC was not using public money for 'muck-raking'.

Former children's minister Tim Loughton said Smith's letters were 'bully-boy tactics'.
