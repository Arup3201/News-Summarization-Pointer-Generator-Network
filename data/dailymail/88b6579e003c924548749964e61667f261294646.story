He's something of a celebrity in Philadelphia's iconic LOVE Park - the Pennsylvanian capital's answer to Times Square's Naked Cowboy, or so they say.

But the city's much-loved 'Philly Jesus' - a daily fixture famous for his attempts to walk on water in the park's fountains and even baptize people - was arrested on Friday for disorderly conduct and failure to disperse, sparking outrage among his many admirers.

The man behind the Holy robe is Michael Grant, a recovering drug addict and panhandler who has been clean for one year, crediting his sobriety to finding Jesus Christ.

However Grant claims the cop that arrested him recognized Grant from his 'drug days' and the long list of charges associated with them, including loitering, possession of marijuana, and theft of services, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.

But in this case Grant said he did nothing wrong, and intends to fight.

His arrest came after he went for a skate around the Dilworth Plaza skating rink.

He was approached by police and accused of solicitation, Grant later claimed on Twitter, saying he accepts tips but does not ask for money, according to NBC Philadelphia.

The cop told Grant to leave the park, but he refused.

Philly Jesus was then arrested.

Grant is said to have recited scripture as he was taken to the police station.

'Those are charges that, in my experience, the government uses when you don't do whatever the government wants you to do, or that the police officer wants you to do,' Grant's lawyer, Charles M. Gibbs, told The Inquirer.

'He's a very decent young man who is simply exercising his First Amendment right of speech,' Gibbs added.

Fans fans quickly took to Twitter and Instagram following Grant's arrest, setting up a 'Free Philly Jesus' hashtag.

On Friday night Grant Tweeted: 'Free dudes.'

He has since retweeted hundreds of messages of support from people on social media.

Gibbs said they are looking forward to Grant's day in court.
