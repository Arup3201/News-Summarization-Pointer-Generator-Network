The teenager left scarred for life after he was speared through the head with a metal pole at a party has savaged two teenage girls who boasted about their link to his attacker.

Liam Knight, 18, has branded two girls 'filth' and 'scum' after they boasted on social media that they invited the gatecrasher who impaled the rod in his head.

He suffered lifelong brain injuries after a young man threw the almost 3m metal rod at him like a javelin at an 18th backyard birthday party at Forestville in Sydney's north in January last year.

The gatecrasher, 17, was found guilty on Friday but the two Sydney girls who invited him have not shown any remorse for Liam, the mother of the party's host Lisa Staples told the Daily Telegraph.

Hours after the guilty verdict, the teenage girls posted a selfie on Instagram bragging that they were 'the girls that showed no remorse'.

The photo reaped more than 100 likes from their friends and followers.

'I'd just like to point out that the two girls who invited the gatecrashers to the 18th where I was injured are absolute filth and the scum of the earth,' Liam, who now suffers from epilepsy and loss of motor function, wrote on Facebook.

'They are basically the reason I am disabled for the rest of my life and they think it is an absolute joke.'

While Liam said he was angry at his attacker, he hated the two girls just as much.

'I hope you are happy with yourselves because you are the reason for the way I am today,' he said.

Liam removed his hatred-filled post from Facebook last night.

The girls, who cannot be named for legal reasons, apologised over the Instagram post after they were contacted by the Daily Telegraph yesterday.

'To the person who wrote the article and to everyone that read it, of course we are remorseful, what's occurred is a tragedy. There are many factors at play here. So please don't point the finger at us,'' one of the girls posted at online yesterday afternoon.

Liam was at Sydney's Downing Centre District Court last Friday with his family to hear the verdicts of the two men accused of critically injuring him.

Jimmy Angelo Tupou, 19, was cleared of any involvement.

But Judge Ronald Solomon found the 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, guilty. He will be sentenced in June.

The 17-year-old arrived at the 18th birthday party at about 11pm before being told to leave because he wasn't invited, the court was told.

He then climbed on the roof of a garden shed and began throwing building materials down into the crowd - among them was the metal rod that pierced Liam's skull.

Liam was sedated by paramedics and firefighters were called in to cut the steel rod, before he was rushed to Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital.

His mother Mary Knight told 60 Minutes last year that she couldn't believe Liam was still alive after seeing the CT scans of his head.

'When I saw the CT scan, I just couldn't believe it. Reality set in that it went right through his head â€” right through the brain,' she told the program.

'I'm thinking, how could he be alive?'
