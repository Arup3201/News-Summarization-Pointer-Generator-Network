Unthinkable tragedy: Among the dead was Dianne Chickaway, 37, whose husband, Dale, survived the horrific crash that, in all, killed six people

The driver of an SUV that careened off a road and into a rain-swollen creek has been charged with six counts of DUI manslaughter.

Driver Duane John's five children, all under the age of ten, and one adult died in Saturday's accident in Neshoba County.

Sheriff Tommy Waddell says bond has been set at $150,000 for 34-year-old John - who was arrested on Monday after his release from hospital.

He was treated for hypothermia and water inhalation.

The accident occurred shortly after midnight on Saturday when John, his five children and three other adults — all crammed into a five-passenger Dodge Durango SUV — left the road and plunged into creek.

Waddell says authorities they are awaiting the official toxicology report, which is expected today, but they are confident alcohol was involved.

The victims were Dasyanna John, nine, Duane John, eight, Bobby John, seven, Quinton John, four, and Kekaimeas John, 18 months.

Dianne Chickaway, 37, also died.

John and two others - including his wife - survived the accident.

None of the children were in child restraints and the adults were not wearing seat belts, according to the Clarion Ledger.

The victims were members of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.

The heartbroken mother of the five children will hold one single, tragic funeral for them today. Chickaway's funeral is scheduled for tomorrow.

'It has hit the community very hard,' Misty Dreifuss, a Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians spokeswoman Dreifuss said of the 10,000-member tribe, one of three federally-recognized groups of Choctaw Indians in the U.S.

A
funeral for Dianne Chickaway, a 37-year-old friend of the children's 
family, meanwhile, is scheduled for Thursday at Hopewell Baptist Church 
in Leake County, according to Dreifuss.

County Sheriff Tommy Waddell said the victims apparently drowned after 
their Dodge Durango swerved off County Rd. 107 shortly after midnight 
Saturday, plunged down an embankment and into a fast-moving, 
rain-swollen creek, located 20 miles southeast of the Mississippi city 
of Philadelphia.

Mother, Deanna Jim, and 
Chickaway's husband, Dale Chickaway, also survived.

Despite the recent rainfall 
and the winter storms sweeping the country, officials said they are confident inclement conditions did not cause the wreck.

'This accident is not weather-related at all,' Waddell said.

'It looked like he has just run off 
the road and went into the water,' Deputy County Coroner Marshall Prince
added to the AP. 'It was deep and swift. The vehicle was completely 
submerged.'

'It's always sad to hear of the death 
of a tribal member,' Tribal Chief Phyliss J. Anderson wrote in a 
statement. 'But today our tribe experienced ...the loss of six beautiful
Choctaw souls.

'I cannot begin to imagine what the 
friends, relatives and loved ones are feeling. There are no words that 
can express our sincere condolences to such a horrific accident.

'I join 
many of you in the outpouring display of love and support shown to the 
families during this difficult time,' Anderson added. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with 
them.'

The Mississippi Band of Choctaw 
Indians resides in the Pearl River community east of the Mississippi 
city of Philadelphia, where it operates a large casino complex.
