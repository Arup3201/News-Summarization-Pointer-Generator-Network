Donald Trump made the best case that his hair is real by taking the ALS ice-bucket challenge on Wednesday. 

The real-estate mogul was nominated by Homer Simpson, Vince McMahon and Mike Tyson  and decided to accept the challenge in style. 

From the top of Trump Tower, the Donald had the beautiful Miss USA and Miss Universe dump ice-cold bottled water over his head to raise awareness of ALS- also known as Lou Gherig's disease.

In the video he even made fun of the ambiguity surrounding his well-coiffed hair. 

'Everybody is going crazy over this thing,' he said. 'I guess they want to see whether or not it's my real hair - which it is.' 

The two beauty-pageant queens then dump the two buckets of water over his head, soaking his bespoke suit. 

'What a mess,' Trump says.

Lots of glue? The Donald's hair held up well to the challenge, despite a long-standing rumor that he wears a toupée

The ALS ice-bucket challenge has been sweeping the internet. Those who are challenged can either opt out by donating to the cause, or film themselves dumping ice-water over their heads.

Many have chosen to both donate and post a video. While Trump did not post about donating to the charity, the billionaire likely wrote out a check for the good cause.

Since July, the ice-bucket challenge has helped raise over $90million to go towards ALS research. 

Trump went on to nominate President Obama, as well as his sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr.
