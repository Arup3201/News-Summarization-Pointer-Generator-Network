Bigamist Simon Lack, 44, married his third wife, above, when he was still married to someone else

A wedding photographer is facing a prison sentence after admitting being a bigamist.

Simon Lack, 44, of Northampton, married wife Tanya in a ceremony in Canada 12 years ago before moving to the UK.

His unsuspecting wife later returned to their home country and Lack promised to follow once he had sold their possessions.

But instead he chose to remain in Northampton, and his wife was unable to afford to get back to the UK.

But while he pretended to his wife he was preparing to join her in Canada, Lack began seeing other women after joining internet dating websites.

He fell for another woman in 2006 and they married in 2008 while he was still wed to Tanya.

On Monday  Lack admitted one count of bigamy when he appeared at Northampton Magistrates’ Court.

Prosecutor Caroline Emmet said: 'The defendant went on dating websites and was seeing other people during his marriage. There is evidence of this on Facebook.'

In 2006 he met another woman via a dating website and embarked on an affair, failing to tell her he was already married to Tanya.

Lack, who also had an ex-wife called Catherine, used his divorce papers to dupe his third wife into believing his marriage to Tanya was over.

In 2008 the pair wed in another ceremony with his new bride none the wiser.

Lack was finally arrested after his wife, whom he left last October for another woman in Devon, became suspicious and called police.

After being arrested, Lack claimed he did not think his second marriage was 'real' and did not realise documents were required to marry and divorce.

Angela Hudson, defending, said it was a 'very unusual case' as her client believed his second wife had 'sorted' their divorce.

Cutting the cake: Lack's new wife married him in some style in 2008, not knowing he was still married to Tanya

Serial groom: Lack, from Northampton, admitted one count of bigamy and will be sentenced next month

Denial: After being arrested Lack, a window salesman, claimed he did not think his second marriage was 'real'

Ms Hudson said Lack was currently working as a double-glazing window salesman but also works part-time as a wedding photographer.

She said Lack had also worked for the police in the past.

Magistrates adjourned the case for three weeks to allow time for a pre-sentence report to be prepared.

The maximum sentence for bigamy is seven years in prison.

Happy occasion: But what no-one realised was that Lack was still married to his previous wife, Tanya
