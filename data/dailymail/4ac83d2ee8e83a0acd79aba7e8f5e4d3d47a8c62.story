Veteran actor Leslie Phillips has been told he can leave hospital – seven weeks after suffering a stroke on a London bus

Veteran actor Leslie Phillips has been told he can leave hospital – seven weeks after suffering a stroke on a London bus.

And the 90-year-old, best known for his line ‘I say, ding dong!’ in Carry On Nurse, joked that there was still time for him to be knighted – adding to his CBE and OBE. He said: ‘Yes, I want the hat-trick. I think I deserve it.

'I'm the longest-serving actor in Britain, having spent the last eight decades in films and on stage.

'That's not a bad feat, is it?' 

Phillips will have to wait another two weeks before he leaves hospital as his £4million home is adapted for the wheelchair he will initially have to use.

He paid tribute to his third wife Zara, 55, whom he married last year and who has rarely left his bedside at the National Hospital for Neurology in Central London.

He said: ‘I doubt I would have got to the point I’m at today without her.’

She has spent 10 hours every day at his bedside caring for him since doctors praised her for saving his life. She was responsible for stopping the bus and getting him the prompt treatment he needed - despite him begging her not to make a fuss.

Mrs Phllips, 55, is overjoyed that her prayers for his recovery have been answered and that they can spend more time together.

'He's a wonderful man,' she said. 'It's little wonder that myself and thousands of his fans love him the way we do.' 

Phillips spoke strongly and firmly yesterday - in marked contrast to the immediate aftermath of the stroke. Initially it badly affected his ability to talk.

He is still unable to eat solid food, his meals have to be liquidised and spoon-fed to him.

He admitted that while he was grateful for all the medical care and attention he had received in hospital, he couldn't wait to go home.

Piles of get-well cards have been sent from all over the world. He has received many phone calls and visits from both friends and family.

He said that while the last few weeks had been 'hell', his return to health had made him fully appreciate life and happiness.

'I need to work to keep the brain active,' he added. 'If only to try to inspire the elderly about how illnesses can be overcome.

'I'm so fortunate having Zara in my life. She's been at my side every day and I doubt I would have got to the point I'm at today without her.'

His health scare has not dimmed his sense of humour.

Yesterday, after a slight coughing fit, he joked: 'It's not the coughing that kills you, it's the coffin that takes you away.'
