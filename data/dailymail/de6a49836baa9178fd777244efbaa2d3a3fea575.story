A 77-year-old janitor is thanking a 'Christmas miracle' for saving him from a dramatic and potentially deadly freak accident.

Manuel Mendoza, who works at a medical clinic in Houston, Texas, was busy cleaning on Tuesday at around 10:45pm when a rogue tire flew off the freeway and straight through a front window he was stood by.

CCTV footage shows the large rubber wheel smashing through the glass at high-speed and throwing Mendoza across the room as it strikes him in the stomach.

Sparks and pieces of debris are seen flying everywhere.

After being hit to the ground, Mendoza struggles to get back on two feet.

Amazingly he escaped the collision with only minor cuts to his face, hands and stomach.

The Spanish-speaker told Local 2 News through an interpreter, that it felt like he was in an 'explosion.'

Apparently the tire came off a truck traveling inbound on the Gulf Freeway. 

An outdoor surveillance camera shows it wheeling across the clinic's parking lot and towards the premises.

Culprit: The tire that hit Mendoza - police are currently investigating the incident 

Mendoza was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital by ambulance for treatment, but he was found to have no major injuries. 

The clinic's owner, Dr. Joseph Sleiman, was passing by his business that night on his way to the airport when he noticed the commotion and stopped to investigate.

He says Mendoza is 'lucky to be alive' but believes more than luck was involved in his survival.

'The size of the tire . . . I believe, probably because [it's] Christmas, God was here. This is what I believe because this is a miracle,' he said.

Houston police are currently investigating the incident.
