These adorable bear cubs had been indulging in boisterous play in woods in Finland under the watchful eye of their mother.

But the second the adult bear warned of approaching danger, the obedient cubs scampered to the top of the nearest tree trunk for safety.

The photographer who captured the scene told how the cubs scurried up the trunk of a fir tree after their mother let out a noise to signal that approach of a large male bear.

Is it gone yet? The cute bear cubs, spotted playing in the woods in Finland, scrambled to hide when their mother warned them of a male bear approaching

After you: The cubs scurried up the trunk of the fir tree before nestling in its branches

Primary school teacher Marko Konig, who took the pictures in woods on the Martinselkonen nature reserve in north east Finland, explained that alpha bears have been known to kill bear cubs in order to mate with their mother.

'The cubs climbed very fast up the tree when a big male came near,' he said.

'Suddenly, the mother made a sound with her mouth and with this the cubs started to climb.

'Otherwise it was all quiet in the woods, except for the sound of birdsong,' the 38-year-old said.

Agile: The brown bear is the national animal of Finland, where the scene took place

Hiding: The cubs scampered up the tree trunk at the sound of their mother's warning

Wilderness: The photographer said birdsong was all that could be heard in the woods while the bear cubs nestled in the trees

Once they had reached a safe distance
from the ground, the bear cubs stopped in the limbs of the 
branches to wait until the threat had passed.

When
the coast was clear they began to gingerly scramble back down to earth,
Mr Konig said, occasionally pausing to glance around them as they clung
to the fir tree's thick trunk.

Despite appearing nervous at first as they began their descent, the cubs 
grew braver and began to shimmy down quickly in a circular movement, the
photographer said.

'When they were back on the floor the cubs relaxed again,' said Mr Konig, who lives near Frankfurt in Germany.

'One started to dig a hole, while the other scratched its back up and down against the bark.'
