A group of North Korean journalists could cancel a trip to Britain because officials in the secretive regime are paranoid about the spread of Ebola, it is claimed.

The group had been expected to travel to the UK to learn online journalism skills and gain an understanding of the British media in a course part-funded by the UK taxpayer.

But now North Korea's strict Ebola-control measures risk thwarting a project which had been criticised as simply teaching the regime's spin doctors how to more effectively peddle propaganda.

North Korea has been under effective lockdown for more than three months to keep the Ebola virus from crossing its borders, with all arrivals facing 21 days quarantine before they can enter the country.

Since the Ebola measures were announced in late October, visas for nonessential travel have been halted and North Korean media has launched a daily barraage of constant reports depicting the dangers of the disease.

North Korea's journalistic exchange trip appears to be the latest victim of the arguably over-enthusiastic health protection measures, according to a report in the the Sunday Express which cited 'Foreign Office sources'.

The paper had earlier broken news of the expected visit by 46 journalists, who work in North Korea's tightly controlled state media and, its report claims, face execution if they dare criticise their country's regime.

Lord Alton of Liverpool, chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on North Korea, told reporters Caroline Wheeler and Alex Stevenson a cancellation could help the ministers avoid embarrassment

'The Foreign Office might see it as a blessing in disguise if they can be given a reason for reconsidering giving a group of people whose speciality is propaganda rather than journalism the opportunity of coming to the UK,' he said.

'I think it has less to do with Ebola and more to do with the insecurity of the regime and their determination to try to prevent any influence by foreigners, aid workers or diplomats.'

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office last month it is funding the project, which will be delivered by the Thomson Foundation and is called 'Inside Out: Working in North Korea to connect its journalists to an internet world.'

It was claimed it could cost the UK taxpayer as much as £70,000, but the FCO said no figures for the course had been finalised, and said it was being run as part of the 'critical engagement' activities with the country.

In a written answer to the House of Lords Baroness Anelay of St Johns said 'The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) maintains extremely tight control over media and restricts access to foreign broadcasting.'

North Korea is one of the most controlled media environments in the world.

All news outlets are controlled by the state and information flowing into and out of the country is monitored.

There is just one news agency, the North Korean Central News Agency, that operates throughout the country.

Internet access is poor, with many north Koreans only able to access a form of an intranet.

Radios and televisions supplied to North Koreans come pre-tuned to Government-controlled stations such as Korean Central Television.

Since Kim Jong-un took over from his father in 2011 there have been attempts to improve media access and information flowing from the country.

This has included an interview Dennis Rodman gave to CNN after travelling to the country earlier this year, following a previous trip where he struck up an unlikely friendship with Kim Jong-un.

But a lot of the news coming from North Korea appears to be tightly stage-managed.

Information about the country's economic difficulties or famines are not generally reported to domestic audiences.

She added: 'The project aims to expose participants to the UK media, instructing them on international reporting practices and the development of technical skills to build websites using a variety of international sources.'

The students took part in a pilot workshop in Pyongyang in October and the study tour to the UK was expected take place in the coming weeks.

North Korea has one of the most restrictive attitudes to the media in the world, precisely controlling information coming into and out of the country.

Journalists have to be a member of the Workers' Party and prove that they come from families with reliable political backgrounds. There is just one agency service for the country.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'The UK has worked tirelessly to raise awareness of horrifying human rights violations in North Korea. Last month, the international community condemned these abuses with a strong resolution in the United Nations.

'This project is an example of the type of international exposure recommended by the UN Commission of Inquiry into human rights in the DPRK. It is just one part of our critical engagement to try to improve the lives of those who live in North Korea.'

A United Nations report earlier this year found that North Koreans are not able to express opinions that are critical of the regime or its official ideology.

It said: 'There is an almost complete denial of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, as well as of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information and association.'

The report said that propaganda is used by the State to create obedience to the leader and that no expression of criticism of the political system goes unpunished, with public executions and people being sent to prison camps known as the 'ultimate' punishments.

An example of the extent the state controls the press was seen when Kim Jong-il died in 2011, but it took two days for news of the death of the former leader to be released.
