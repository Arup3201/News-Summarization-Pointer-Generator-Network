Highway patrol officer Gordon Roberts does not take kindly to drivers who break the law... in fact, he rather looks down on them.

The Tennessee State Trooper has an ingenious way of spotting motorists who drink, text or don't wear seat belts at the wheel - by patrolling the motorways in a 40-tonne lorry.

The 18-wheel juggernaut gives him the perfect vantage point from which to peer into other cars and spot any un-driver-like behaviour.

The only trouble is that pulling over cars in an 80-foot articulated truck presents more than a few problems, not to mention the logistics of a high-speed chase.

So instead he just radios police headquarters with what he sees and the control room dispatches a team of troopers to chase the outlaws down in patrol cars and dish out tickets.

'We should be able to nab some people here', he told Timesfreepress.com on Thursday morning.

And sure enough, he snared no less than seven offenders from his cab that day, six feet in the air.

He is one of 97 officers in the state who carry a heavy goods licence so they too can trundle the roads peering into passing cars.

It is the brainchild of Lt. John Harmon who asked Roberts to drive the semi as part of 'Stay 
Alive on 75,' a police initiative to raise awareness about crashes on the 
highway.

'The Tennessee Highway Patrol will be utilizing every resource 
available in the Chattanooga district to make our highways safer,' 
Harmon said in a statement.

The initiative was launched this week as new research today revealed text messaging while behind the wheel
is as dangerous as being twice over the legal drink-drive limit,.

Scientists compared the effects of mobile phone use while driving with the effects of alcohol using a driving simulator.

Their
experiment demonstrated that sending a text message or even using a 
hands-free mobile phone kit is the same as being above the legal alcohol
limit for driving.

A high school student texts while 'driving' in this simulator which shows the consequences of texting while behind the wheel

A national telephone survey by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety 
conducted in 2010 found that 69 percent of drivers had used a cellphone 
while driving and 24 percent had texted while driving during the 
previous 30 days.

'To me this says we still have a huge distracted driving problem. 
It's a cultural problem, and we haven't convinced the country yet that 
this is a serious issue,' said Jonathan Adkins, deputy executive 
director of the Governors Highway Safety Association.
