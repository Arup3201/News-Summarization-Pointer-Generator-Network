Mega-basement: Christian Candy, pictured with wife Emily, wants to build a leisure centre underneath his Thames-side mansion

A property tycoon has submitted plans to build a bowling alley, cinema and private spa under a two century old mansion owned by the Royal Hospital Chelsea.

Property developer Christian Candy wants to build the extravagant complex under the Thames-side Gordon House, which was once nurses' quarters at the hospital, home to the Chelsea pensioners.

The 29-year-old businessman, who has an estimated £150 million fortune, bought a long lease on the property from The Royal Hospital for a reported £75 million last year - the first time the house was offered on the market since it was built in 1809.

He submitted plans submitted to Kensington and Chelsea council last week.

They detail a sprawling underground space, including a swimming pool, with a cold plunge pool and jacuzzi, sauna and steam room.

The plans also show a dance studio, treatment rooms, a cinema and an 18-metre two-lane bowling alley, the Evening Standard reports.

It is believed, if approved, the plans would make it one of London's largest home basements at 1,200 square metres.

The redevelopment plans for the property include three historic buildings - the house, an Orangery, and a smaller building, Creek Lodge - underneath which would be the basement and a new two storey modern annexe above it.

Kensington and Chelsea Council has said it will limit the size and depth of basements from the end of the year.

Proposal: Mr Candy wants to built the extravagant expansion under neath the two century old Gordon House in Chelsea

However, because Gordon House sits in 
two acre grounds, architects Paul Davis &Partners are able to design
a much larger subterranean living area than has previously been 
possible.

It is 
believed that because they are going under the garden rather than the 
building, or surrounding streets, they have been allowed freer rein. 

Savills agents handled the original sale.

Jonathan Hewlett, head of London residential at the agents, told the paper that this had 'given them scope to accommodate everything they could possibly want.'

'The best basements are not the ones that go down 25 floors they’re are the ones that offer fantastic space and total privacy.'

The plans were originally drawn up by the Royal Hospital.

Plans for the subterranean 'lifestyle' place have been submitted to Kensington and Chelsea council

They have been amended by Mr Candy, who has said that he wants to return Gordon House 'to its historic use as a single-family residence.'

Mr Candy was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline.

But a spokesman for his company CPC Group told the Evening Standard that the revised application was a 'minor amendment to The Royal Hospital’s existing approved planning application.'

Gordon House was designed by Thomas Leverton for Colonel James Willoughby Gordon. Upon his death in 1851, it became part of the Royal Hospital and was used as nurses quarters.

The orangery was most recently used by the red-coated Chelsea pensioners as a library.
