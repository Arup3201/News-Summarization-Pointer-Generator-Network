Lynn Jennifer Groesbeck died when she lost control of the car she was driving in Spanish Forks, Utah,  crashing into a river on Saturday.

Submerged: The temperature in the river was near freezing throughout the night after the car hit the river. Water flowed into the car through broken windows and rushed just below Lily's head 

Rescuers say they used all their strength to right the red Dodge sedan, when they heard desperate pleas coming from a woman inside.

Lily was then pulled from the wreckage with officers then discovering that her mother had been dead for hours.

Now Spanish Forks police have released a transcript of the 911 calls made by an angler who saw the car submerged in the water.

According to the Deseret News, the first call was made to a non-emergency line, with the caller saying: 'Are you guys aware there's a car in the river on the south end of Spanish Fork, Main Street, over the bridge?

'I didn't see anybody when I came in here and I can't see in the car.'

Then four minutes later, the same caller dials 911 directly saying: 'There's a car in the river. It's upside down off of Main Street and there is a person inside. I can see a hand.'

Car crash: Police believe that Lynn Groesbeck struck a cement barrier on a bridge before landing in the river upside down on Friday

Devastating: A fisherman found car the next day, partially submerged in the river. Groesbeck was found dead in driver's seat of vehicle, while her baby girl was alive in the back seat, above the frigid river waters

Since the dramatic rescue, police officers have spoke of how Miss Groesbeck, could not have possibly called out to rescuers because she was already dead.

Officer Tyler Beddoes said: 'For two nights I've laid awake trying to figure out exactly what it could be. All I know is it was there, we all heard it. was extra motivation.'

Mr Beddoes said that he and the other three people on scene responded to the voice calling for help when they approached the car.

Officers then formed a line in the river and handed the cold girl to one another until she was on the shoreline and in emergency workers' arms.

They rushed her to an ambulance and performed CPR. She is now in a stable condition in hospital and improving.

It is still unclear how she managed to survive hanging upside down in her car seat for 14 hours with no food or water.

Rescue mission: When Lily was retreived from the car, police officers handed the cold girl to one another until she reached the shore and emergency workers could rush her to the hospital

 Aspiring dreams: Jill Sanderson, Lynn's sister, said Groesbeck was enrolled at Provo College with a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life

Night drive: Police said that Lynn Groesbeck was driving home from her parents' house in Salem on Friday when the accident occurred

Unknown cause: Investigators are still unsure as to what caused the crash. There were no skid marks on the road and no signs of mechanical errors in the car

As she dangled, icy water rushed just below her head through broken car windows as the Dodge Caliber sat perched on the bank and rocks. The temperatures were near freezing throughout the night and through the morning.

Mr Beddoes added: 'It's heartbreaking. Was she crying most the night?'

'It's a miracle... She was needed for sure elsewhere.'

We can't explain the voice, but have no doubt we heard it.

'That's the part that really sends me for a whirl. I'm not really religious, but that's what you think of.'

Police believe the accident occurred when the Miss Groesbeck, struck a cement barrier on a bridge and careened into the river late Friday in Spanish Fork, about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City.

She was driving to her home in Springville after visiting her parents in Salem.

Mystery: A neighbor reported hearing a loud noise on Friday just after the car crash, but when they checked the area around Provo, no cause of sound could be located

Frigid: The waters of the river, just 50 miles outside Salt Lake City were near freezing. Multiple emergency responders were treated for hypothermia

Obstruction: Police said the car likely sat in the river for so long because the scene of the accident shielded by cement barriers on the side of the road

Investigators are still unsure of what caused the crash as there are no skid marks or signs of mechanical failures in the car.

Police don't suspect drugs or alcohol as a factor but are awaiting toxicology test results.

Paying tribute, Miss Grosebeck's sister Jill Sanderson said she had a goal of becoming a medical assistant, and had lived in the Provo area her entire life, according to KSL .

She said: 'She was very compassionate and a very loving person and always willing to bend over backwards for her loved ones.

'Her baby was the love of her life. She was an amazing mother.'

 Family: Groesbeck's sister Jill Sanderson said that Lily is doing remarkably well and she thanks all of the officers who saved the baby
