For caffeine addicts, it could be the jolt they need to kick their addiction.

A new app claims to be able to track the affect caffeine is having on your body.

It can tell you exactly how much another cup will impact your sleep, and when to lay off the coffee or soft drinks.

Jawbone's UP Coffee app can tell users when to lay off the caffeine

Developed by Jawbone Labs, a forum for Jawbone employees to explore and expand upon their ideas and prototypes, the standalone application helps you understand more about your caffeine choices by correlating caffeine intake and projected sleep time.

Simply log a coffee, tea, energy drink or other caffeinated beverage in the UP Coffee app to see a visual display of where you fall on a spectrum from 'Wired' to 'Sleep Ready' at any given time.

When linked with data from your UP or UP24 band, UP Coffee analyzes how your caffeine intake affects your sleep patterns.

After tracking both caffeine intake and sleep for 10 days, UP Coffee can tell you things like the amount of sleep you lose on average for every 100mg of caffeine you ingest.

The app can track caffeine intake over time and build personalised reports for users - telling them exactly how much another cup will affect their sleep

'With billions of people around the world enjoying coffee, tea and other caffeinated drinks each day, the UP Coffee app delivers daily insights with new information on caffeine that’s relevant to you,' the firm says.

It can tell you how much caffeine is in a cup of decaf coffee – nearly half as much as a can of caffeinated soda – and that drinking three to six cups of coffee per day may provide similar hydrating qualities as water.To coincide with National Sleep Week, Jawbone also revealed new data highlighting the links between UP wearers’ sleep and feelings of wellbeing.

Jawbone also analyzed the data of more than 1,600 UP wearers and more than 5,000 nights of sleep to verify the relationship between our sleep and how we feel the next day. 

On average, members of the UP community who got at least seven hours of sleep were 30% more likely to report feeling rested the next day.

Those UP wearers were also significantly more likely to report feeling optimistic, patient, focused, productive, and attractive the next day. In addition, the study found that Sound sleep – the moments of sleep when your body is particularly still – had a greater impact above and beyond total time spent sleeping.

The study also revealed fascinating insights into the causes of sleeplessness, with a quarter of UP wearers in the study reporting difficulty falling asleep.

Of those, nearly half attribute their sleep issues to stress, 20% to room temperature, and 18% to simply not feeling tired.

Only 3% of those who reported difficulty falling asleep attribute their sleep issues to noisiness or to children. 

The data from Jawbone also showed the affects of lifestyle habits and gadgetry on our sleep, in particular Sound sleep.

UP wearers who reported having a laptop in their bedroom logged 37 minutes less sound sleep per night on average, and UP wearers who slept with a mobile phone had 13 minutes less sound sleep on average.

'We're investing heavily in data, and as a result, we're learning a tremendous amount about behavior change and how to help people achieve their goals,' said Travis Bogard, vice president of product management and strategy at Jawbone.

'In a recent test with our Today I Will feature, we saw that those who were sent and opted into the commitment logged 23 more minutes of sleep than average and were 72% more likely to go to bed early enough to hit their sleep goal.

'By leveraging these insights within the UP system, we're beginning to help people achieve real change.

'Our latest data shows a strong connection between how much we sleep and how we feel the next day, and these are exactly the kinds of correlations that can be powerful motivators to people on a daily basis.'
