The posters show apparently terrified people running down flights of stairs, cowering in a darkened corner and anxiously talking on their mobile phones

Alarmist posters on what commuters should do in the event of a terror outrage were issued by police yesterday.

Instead of an appeal for calm, the advice is ‘run, hide and tell’ in a throwback to notices at the height of nuclear attack hysteria in the 1980s.

The campaign urges commuters to ‘stay safe’ during a firearms or weapons attack.

The posters show apparently terrified people running down flights of stairs, cowering in a darkened corner and anxiously talking on their mobile phones.

The flyers tell passengers what to do in the event of a Mumbai-style gun attack or bombing at one of the UK’s busy terminals.

They are being distributed by police after Home Secretary Theresa May warned this week that the threat to Britain from home-grown Muslim extremists or those returning from fighting with Islamic State in Syria or Iraq is ‘greater than ever’. 

The posters instruct: ‘If you hear gunfire or a weapons attack, leave the area safely if you can. If this puts you in greater danger, find a safe place to take cover.’

But critics have claimed the posters, handed out around the country as part of Counter Terrorism Awareness Week, are ‘scaremongering’ and have been compared the leaflets to the Cold War adverts telling people to ‘Duck and Cover’ if caught in a nuclear attack.

Chief Constable Paul Crowther, of the British Transport Police (BTP) said: ‘For commuters, who make the same journey over and over again, it can be easy to become oblivious to their surroundings.

‘But I would urge them to remain alert, use their instinct and have the confidence to report anything that strikes them as out-of-place or suspicious.

He added that earlier this month a man was sentenced for terrorism offences after being caught in possession of information about how to make bombs.

University student Andreas Pierides, 22, narrowly avoided jail after he admitted taking nine distress flares on to a passenger jet at Stansted Airport and possessing a terrorist manual.

Police arrested him as he was about to board a flight after a member of the public saw him reading an electronic publication on a train which appeared to include bomb-making instructions.

He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment suspended for two years after claiming he was going to set off the flares at a football match.‘This was as a direct result of a rail passenger reporting suspicions to train staff. We need others to follow suit and play their part in keeping the UK’s transport systems safe from terrorists,’ he said.

But transport users took to Twitter to complain about the leaflets, which some said were stoking fear.

Rob Thompson wrote: ‘These leaflets are more likely to cause panic than any apparent terrorism.

Chris Irvine, from Rochester, Kent, said: ‘I cannot believe that the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Metropolitan Police are putting this out.

‘It’s totally alarmist. I grew up in Northern Ireland but I have never seen anything like it. Obviously we have to take the threat seriously, but I don’t see how striking the fear of God into people helps.’

And Michael Earl added: ‘Unbelievable! They might as well just say “Run like hell and start a panic”.’

The leaflets were handed out after Mrs May used a keynote speech to reveal that 40 terrorist attacks had been foiled since the July 7 bombings in London in 2005, which killed 52 commuters.

Yesterday  the Home Office published a range of anti-terrorism measures aimed at tackling the threat, including stripping would-be jihadists of their passports and a legal requirement by schools, prisons and councils to put in place policies to stop would-be extremists being radicalised.

In her speech on Monday, Mrs May said: ‘We are in the middle of a generational struggle against a deadly terrorist ideology. These powers are essential to keep up with the very serious and rapidly changing threats we face.

‘In an open and free society, we can never entirely eliminate the threat from terrorism. But we must do everything possible in line with our shared values to reduce the risks posed by our enemies.’
