John Lewis sent ripples of surprise through the High Street when a model with a grown out beard presented their menswear collection this time last year.

Dishevelled former carpenter Johnny Harrington was hailed by the retail giant as representing 'a hard-working, everyday-hero kind of bloke who cares about his looks'.

And now, great British fashion store New Look have followed suit and enlisted their very own model with a mighty beard to front their latest AW14 menswear campaign - ex-roofer Billy Huxley.

Hot model of the moment Billy has shot with Adidas, Duffer of St George, Vagabond and now New Look

Hot model of the moment Billy, 24, stands tall at 6ft 2" and his voluminous auburn beard makes his bright green eyes stand out even more.

He's a huge male icon and has a cult fanbase on social media boasting more than 20,000 Twitter followers and a staggering 87,000 on Instagram.

The young model was even named a Fashion Influencer to know about in 2014 by Fashion Beans.

He's now the face of New Look menswear for AW15 but Billy's previously shot campaigns for adidas, Duffer of St George, Vagabond and many more.

His 
prolific tattoos include serpents snaking up his neck and roses down his
 hands, and make him the perfect choice for New Look's latest menswear 
offering.

The label's new collection has strong 
naval and military influences; stormy seas and dark skies inspire the 
colour palette, prints and heavy textures.

Deep blues and greens are 
accented with pops of neon and set off with khaki and muted tones. Cable
 knit jumpers, wool pea coats, Breton stripes and heavy military boots 
are key.

Urban influences are seen in sportswear separates - 
joggers, tees and baseball jackets are given a lux update with the use 
of zips, panelling and texture.

Tailoring is slim and tapered with an update of modern focus on checks, dogtooth and contrast panelling.

Long wool overcoats and PU details showcase a darker direction for formalwear.

Slogan sweats alongside pastel hues give a Parisian-chic edge that adds a touch of preppy to the collection.

Available at New Look stores and newlook.com from July with prices starting at £14.99
