Confrontation: Rashaad Ben, 23, was seen getting out of his car in Austin, Texas, earlier this month and approaching Julie Nowlin. He then spat on the window, stuck up his middle fingers and shouted 'Black Power' 

The 39-year-old mother recorded the confrontation on her cell phone and the video has since gone viral.

She claims that Ben pulled over and got out three times on the same stretch of road. He was angry because she was trying to take a picture of his licence plate. 

Ben has a lengthy rap sheet with more than 20 arrests, including criminal convictions for drunk driving, marijuana possession, theft, resisting arrest, and driving with a suspended license. 

If convicted of the reckless driving charge, Ben faces a maximum of 30 days in jail. 

Altercation: After the bizarre incident he got back in his car. Other motorists claimed to have been involved in similar confrontations with Ben and police revealed he spat at another woman last month 

Ben has since apologized, telling KVUE: 'I came here to apologize to my family and Mrs. Nowlin and to the community for acting the way I did and for my obscene language and obscene behavior.' 

The station reported that since the video spread, other motorists have come forward suggesting they have had similar encounters with Ben. 

Last month police reported that he spat in the face of another woman, Charlotte Cross, during an argument inside a store. 

She told KVUE: 'When I saw him apologizing and acting like you know that this was his first time and that it's not in his character, yes it is.

'He needs to be behind bars because it's going to turn into something worse and someone is going to end up getting hurt.'
