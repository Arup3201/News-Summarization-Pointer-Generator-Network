The fully-clothed body of amateur footballer Luke Griffin was found by a dog walker in Newquay on Saturday morning

Two people have been arrested on suspicion of assault after the body of a 'charming' 20-year-old was washed up on a Cornish beach.

The fully-clothed body of amateur footballer Luke Griffin, who had been on an end-of-season tour with his club, was found by a dog walker in Newquay on Saturday morning.

It is believed he may have plunged over a nearby cliff in the notorious party town.

Police said Luke, who was also known as Luke Harrisonn, was involved in an 'incident' earlier in the evening at a pay-and-display car park just above an access road for nearby Towan Beach.

They have arrested two 41-year-old men from Bedford on suspicion of assault and today both men were bailed until September.

Officers still don't know how Luke ended up in the sea and are appealing to anyone who may have seen him in the Crescent and Tram Tracks area of Newquay between 10.30pm and 11pm on Friday.

Luke’s aunt, Debbie Harrison, paid tribute to her nephew on the social networking website Facebook after hearing the shock news.

She said: 'We are all totally devastated. Why does it happen to the good guys? He is and always will be a legend.

'My handsome nephew. RIP hunny.'

Luke's body was found by dog walkers on Newquay’s Great Western Beach on Saturday morning.

Locals claimed Luke, from Stroud, Gloucestershire, who was on tour with Leonard Stanley AFC and 19 other club members, fell into the water from a cliff top.

One nearby hotel worker, who did not want to be named, said: 'One of our staff walked past the private ambulance as it arrived.

'Somebody said this morning that a lad had fallen over the cliff.'

A local restaurant worker, who also asked not to be named, added: 'The forensics were there for about 30 to 45 minutes then they took away the body. It’s such a tragedy.'

A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said today: 'Officers are keen to ascertain the male’s movements prior to him being found on the beach.

'He is described as a 20 year old white male with pale skin, of thin build with short black hair and was wearing a black polo shirt, blue denim jeans and white trainers.

'Officers are particularly interested if anyone saw this male around the Crescent and Tram Tracks area of Newquay between 10.30 and 11pm on Friday 1st June.'

Speaking before yesterday’s arrests, the spokesman said: 'The family of the man have since been informed of his death.

'Our thoughts are clearly with his friends and family at this time.

Great Western Beach in Newquay, Cornwall where Luke's body was found. Police said he had been earlier involved in an 'incident' in a car park in the resort

'We have established that he was involved in an incident in the town earlier in the evening and are speaking to two individuals with regard to this incident.

'There are also a number of other lines of inquiry at this time and we would urge anyone with any further information that they feel may assist us.'

Yesterday soccer club friend Ken Roberts said Luke was last seen talking to who girls in the Sailors Bar in the town.

He said the trip to Newquay had been planned for some time and the group went down in a mini bus on Friday and were staying in a surfing lodge.

Police said Luke was involved in an 'incident' earlier in the evening at a pay-and-display car park just above an access road for nearby Towan Beach (pictured)

He said: 'When we got there some of the boys 
went for a swim, but not Luke. We spent the day in Newquay and then got 
together around 7.45pm to go on a pub crawl. We started in the Sailors 
Bar and that’s where we left Luke.

'He was chatting up a couple of girls.
He was a charmer. We all went different ways because six lads drove 
down later on Friday. It was mostly the younger lads in our teams. We 
then met up again at 10pm and Luke was not there.

'The next morning Luke was still not 
back. One of our team is a teacher and got in touch with the police. We 
saw the helicopter over the beach and we wanted to see if Luke had been 
arrested overnight or something.

'They rang him back a couple of hours later after they put two and two together.

'We were spoken to by the police who 
told us that Luke did not have any marks on him. We don’t know what 
happened in the car park but it was nothing to do with our lot.

Friends said Luke Griffin was last seen talking to two girls in the popular Sailors Bar in Newquay. It is not known what exactly happened to him after he left

'I don’t think it had anything to do 
with the girls he had been chatting up. We arrived at the resort in our Leonard Stanley football shirts but changed in the evening. I think Luke
was wearing blue trousers but I don't know what else.

'He was a very popular member of our 
group. He drank no more than most young lads but he was 
certainly not in the top ten of drinkers in our club.'

Further tributes to builder and carpenter Luke on Facebook 
included one from friend Charlotte Jones who said: 'What a waste. Can’t 
believe this brilliant, charming, sweet kid was taken.'

Newquay has become a mecca for students who descend on the town for alcohol-fuelled weekends away to celebrate the end of their GCSEs and A Levels.

Officials have been battling to improve the town’s reputation following several deaths and near fatalities in recent years.

In the summer of 2009 Andrew Curwell, 19, and Paddy Higgins, 16, fell to their deaths from cliffs in separate incidents whilst celebrating the end of their exams.

The deaths led to the introduction of a security plan for the resort, including the confiscation of alcohol carried by under-age drinkers and police patrols on trains.

Since then dozens of teenagers have been sent home after arriving drunk and an alcohol-free zone has been set up in the town centre.

But in January this year the body of university graduate Oliver Doy, 26, was found on Newquay beach after he vanished during a night out in the town.

He was last seen leaving Sailors nightclub in the early hours of Saturday January 7 after previously boasting on Facebook that he was planning 'six days of mayhem'.
