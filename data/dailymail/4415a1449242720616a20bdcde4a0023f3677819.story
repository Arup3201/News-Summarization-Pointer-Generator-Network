A sleeping six-year-old Wisconsin girl was repeatedly stabbed by her mother with a 7-inch steak knife, police say.

‘Mommy tried to kill me,’ the terrified young victim, Adrianna - who is recovering from life-threatening stab wounds, told an officer after the harrowing attack.

Tasha D. Harmon (in a 2009 mugshot) allegedly stabbed her sleeping 6-year-old daughter several times

Police say the girl’s mother Tasha D. Harmon, 29, entered her daughter's bedroom while the girl slept, around 2:30am on Monday at Harmon’s apartment in Fitchburg, Wisconsin.

The crazed mom allegedly stabbed the girl several times in the chest and back, inflicting critical injuries including a punctured lung.

The mom then turned the knife on herself, stabbing herself on her chest and throat.

Covered in blood after the attack, Harmon walked next door to the apartment of a neighbour and said, ‘I just stabbed my daughter and myself,’ according to the search warrant obtained by the Wisconsin State Journal.

In a panic, the neighbour raced to Harmon’s home to find Adrianna covered in blood, laying on her bed with the steak knife at her feet.

The girl was hospitalized and listed in critical condition. She is expected to recover. 

The mom was also hospitalized for her injuries.

She was released on Thursday and moved to the Dane County Jail, where she is expected to be charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, according to Fitchburg police Lt. Todd Stetzer.

The motive for the attack remains unclear. Court documents reveal Harmon told police, ‘I went crazy.’

Court records show that the 29-year-old has a rap sheet -- with a previous felony conviction for second-degree reckless 
endangerment in 2007 and misdemeanor convictions for issuing bad checks, in addition to other charges.
