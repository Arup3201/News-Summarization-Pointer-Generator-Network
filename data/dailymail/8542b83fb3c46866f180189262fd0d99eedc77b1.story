Controversial: Incoming Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has already upset Israel with comments made in a television interview two days before his inauguration

Iran's president-elect has dashed hopes of a period of calm with Israel after he described the country as a 'wound' that needs to be removed from the Middle East.

Hassan Rouhani made the contentious comments in a state-run television interview about the occupation of Palestinian land just days ahead of his inauguration as Iran's new leader.

According to Iranian press reports, he said: 'The Zionist regime is a wound that has sat on the body of the Muslim world for years and needs to be removed.'

The comments, made on Quds Day, an annual event held in Iran to support Palestinians and denounce Israel, were described as 'hostile' by Israeli president Benjamin Netanyahu.

He said: ‘The true face of Rouhani has been 
revealed sooner than expected ... this is what the man thinks and this 
is the Iranian regime’s plan of action.

'A nation that threatens to destroy the state of Israel must not be allowed to have weapons of mass destruction,' he said in a statement.

The comments echo those made by outgoing president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who threatened Israel in his final speech as leader warning that a 'ferocious storm' would strike the nation.

But Rouhani has been quick to distance himself from the comments, with officials claiming that 'unidentified news agencies' had distorted his remarks.

The US and its allies suspect Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability.

Tehran says its nuclear programme is purely for peaceful purposes, but Israel regards it as a threat to its existence and refuses to rule out military action.

With the election of an apparently more pragmatic president, it had been hoped Western countries might see a better chance for diplomacy and strike a deal to curb Iran’s uranium enrichment programme and avoid any conflict.

Hitting out: Mr Rouhani allegedly described Israel as a 'wound' that needs to be removed from the Middle East

Rouhani's predecessor Ahmadinejad also addressed Israel on Qods Day in his last speech as president.

He said: 'You planted wind in our region and you will reap the storm. I swear to God that a ferocious storm is coming and it will uproot the Zionist entity.'

Earlier, the ‘Supreme Leader of Iran’, Ayatollah Ali Khameni issued a fatwa against the minority Baha’i community  - calling on Iranians to avoid Baha’is and labelling them a ‘deviant and misleading sect’.

The edict illustrates that despite Rouhani’s  promises to rule with moderation and ensure the rights of religious minorities, ultimate power in Iran rests with the Supreme Leader.
