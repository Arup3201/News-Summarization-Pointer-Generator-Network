It's not Dvorak! Jeremy Paxman corrected students this week on University Challenge, confusing the Czech music with a Gregorian plainsong

His withering put-downs have humiliated University Challenge contestants for years.

But Jeremy Paxman was finally forced to sample a taste his own medicine after the programme this week, when viewers pulled him up on a series of errors.

The presenter fell short of his own high standards on the BBC2 show on Monday.

His first gaffe came when a team from Clare College Cambridge  were asked to name the Czech composer of a piece of music as a bonus question.

After they wrongly guessed Smetana, Paxman quickly corrected them, saying: ‘No, it’s Dvorak’s Requiem in B flat minor.’

But it was not long before music experts pointed out the clip was actually a Gregorian plainchant and not the work of Dvorak.

One viewer, Helen Garrison – a senior producer for the BBC Singers and Radio 3 – tweeted: ‘Appalled at the ignorance of question on #universitychallenge.’

Another, Nick Edmonds, wrote: ‘Did #universitychallenge just play a requiem plainsong and ask which composer it was by?’

He added: ‘Some work to do on their musical knowledge.’

And a third, Damian Farrell tweeted: ‘Err … was there a mistake with the music question about Dvorak’s requiem on university challenge?’ Paxman’s second blunder came when Clare College were asked to identify the missing sister from Jane Austen’s novel Pride And Prejudice.

The Clare College team responded ‘Eliza Bennet’ but Paxman soon told them that they had got the answer wrong.

The question was then handed over to their rivals, Christ Church Oxford, whose answer ‘Elizabeth Bennet’ was accepted.

Wronged: The Clare College Cambridge team answer a question during University challenge but academics have pointed out that the answer given by Jeremy Paxman was wrong

Viewers took to the BBC’s online 
messageboard to point out that Austen herself repeatedly refers to 
Elizabeth Bennet as ‘Eliza’ throughout the book.

One viewer, Pat Shed, 
said: ‘I remain unsure how Christ Church got to answer the Austen 
bonuses. On the starter question, Clare identified “Eliza Bennet” as the
missing sister. And lo and behold, 22 times in P&P that sister is 
referred to as “Eliza”.

However the answer was deemed to be incorrect 
while “Elizabeth” was accepted.’ Another added: ‘I was a bit surprised 
that Paxo didn’t accept Eliza as correct.’

Despite the blunders, Clare College went on to beat their rivals and land a place in the quarter-finals of the TV quiz.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘The excerpt that we played was not composed by Dvorak himself.

‘We
apologise to both teams and viewers and are grateful to those who 
pointed this out. Fortunately this error has not changed the outcome of 
the programme.’

The blunder is not the first time the experienced host has been spotted getting things wrong.

Last
month, Paxman was accused of making another error when he scathingly 
corrected a contestant who said a recording of Fagin from the musical 
Oliver! featured Omid Djalili.

Some thought Paxman was wrong to deliver 
such a withering put-down, as the actor had played the role in another 
production.
