Charged: Ellen Wermeling, 32, faces a charge of improper relationship between educator and student. She is on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation

A Texas teenager who claims he had sex with his high school counselor has defended her and says the pair did nothing wrong.

Ellen Wermeling, 32, has been fired from her job by the Aldine Independent School District and appeared in court in Houston on Friday charged with having an improper relationship with a student.

In an off camera interview, the alleged victim told KHOU-TV: 'In the heat of the moment, nothing really was wrong. At the end of the day, I’m 18 and I'm an adult and I make my own decisions.'

The teen reportedly confessed to a football coach that he was having sex with the counselor.

He says the alleged relationship began after he messaged her on Instagram, telling her he was 'bored' and had nothing to do.

The coach proceeded to tell the MacArthur High School principal, who notified the school district police.

The 12th-grade student told investigators how he messaged Wermeling through Instagram on February 28 and she agreed to pick him up so they could 'hang out' at her residence.

He says the two watched a movie, then engaged in sexual intercourse.

The teen says he and Wermeling again had sex at her residence on March 6 and March 8.

The school started an investigation and court documents state Wermeling denied that the student had ever been to her residence and denied the two had sex.

Investigators say Wermeling told them she never spoke to the teen through Instagram, reports Click2Houston.

According to court documents, investigators say Wermeling's Instagram account was closed on March 25, the same day she was contacted about the allegations.

Wermeling was booked and released on $10,000 bond. She is on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. She had been working at the school since 2005.

'Aldine Independent School District has been made aware of a MacArthur High School staff member being charged with having an inappropriate relationship with a MacArthur student. The district takes this allegation seriously and is fully cooperating with authorities,' said a school statement Friday.

'The Aldine ISD Police Department launched an investigation and once it was completed turned over its findings to the Harris County District Attorney's Office. The staff member was removed from the campus once the district learned of the allegation and will not be returning.
