A Liberal Democrat minister called last night for cannabis to be  legalised for medical use.

Norman Baker said the drug could help relieve symptoms for sufferers of conditions such as multiple sclerosis and help those having chemotherapy.

But the Home Office minister's suggestion was dismissed by a Coalition spokesman who pointed to 'clear evidence  cannabis can damage people's mental and physical health'.

Drugs minister Norman Baker wants cancer sufferers to be allowed to use cannabis to alleviate pain

Mr Baker's comments are the latest in a series from Lib Dem ministers pressing for a softening of drugs laws.

Opponents
 of allowing  cannabis for medical purposes insist it could be used as a
 back door to decriminalising the drug more widely.

But Mr Baker said there was a 'growing body of research'  showing the 'medical properties' of cannabis.

He proposed the change in a letter to Health Secretary  Jeremy Hunt which was leaked to The Guardian newspaper.

'It
 is time to reconsider the medicinal properties of cannabis, given what 
I've learned in my role as a minister,' wrote Mr Baker.

'I've seen more and more  evidence that cannabis can  provide genuine medical benefits to treat a number of conditions.

The US state of Colorado made history on New Year's day this year - becoming the first to allow cannabis to be sold over the counter.

Colorado, along with Washington state, voted to legalise the use and possession of cannabis for people over the age of 21 in November 2012.

Washington allowed licensed shops in the state to sell the drug in July.

Colorado and Washington are among 20 states to have approved marijuana use for medical purposes. The drug is still illegal under federal law.

'There is a growing body of research that shows the medical properties of chemical components of cannabis.

'I
 am uncomfortable that there are credible people I have met who tell me 
that cannabis is the only substance that helps relieve their condition. 
But not only are they stopped from accessing it officially but have to 
break the law to help their health.

'Other
 countries recognise that cannabis does have medicinal benefit and we 
need to look again at this to help people who are ill. This is a quite 
separate matter from recreational use which is not at issue here.'

He suggested cannabis could be used to help conditions such as MS and glaucoma.

In addition, it could be used to combat the side-effects of  treatment for cancer, Aids and Crohn's disease.

Campaigners for wholesale changes to drugs legalisation welcomed his intervention.

Last
 week, Mr Baker's party leader Nick Clegg pledged to abolish prison 
terms for users caught with any drugs, including class A substances such
 as cocaine and heroin.

It was 'utterly senseless' to lock up the 1,000 people a year convicted of possession, he said.

Cannabis can bring relief to patients suffering from the side effects of cancer and Aids treatment

The
 law currently allows drugs firms to develop medicines based on cannabis
 under a licence granted by the Home Office.  One such medicine, 
Sativex, is already authorised for use in the UK for the treatment of 
MS.

However, a Home Office 
spokesman said: 'This Government has no plans to legalise cannabis or to
 soften our approach to its use as a medicine.

'There
 is clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful 
drug which can  damage people's mental and physical health. Our 
cross-government strategy remains clear.

'We
 must prevent drug use in our communities, support users through 
treatment and recovery, and tackle the organised criminals behind the 
drugs trade.

'There has been a long-term downward trend in drug use over the last decade.

'Drug-related
 deaths in  England and Wales have continued to fall during the past 
three years and people going into treatment today are more likely to 
free themselves from dependency than ever before.'
