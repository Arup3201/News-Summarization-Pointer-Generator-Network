Mario Balotelli’s former girlfriend and the mother of his baby girl, is suing the footballer’s parents after they wrote an open letter accusing her of 'cashing in and exploiting' their son.

Showgirl Raffaella Fico, 25, and Balotelli, 22, had a stormy relationship which ended last summer, just before she revealed she was pregnant with his child Pia, who was born in December, but who he refuses to officially acknowledge - demanding a DNA test to prove he is the father.

The couple have since carried out a bitter war of words in various magazine articles with Raffaella accusing him of being 'uninterested in his child and her' and which resulted in his adoptive parents Franco and Silvia Balotelli hitting back saying that 'love was worth more than money and fame.'

Story: Showgirl Raffaella Fico, 25, and Balotelli, 22, had a stormy relationship which ended last summer, just before she revealed she was pregnant with his child Pia, who was born in December, but who he refuses to officially acknowledge - demanding a DNA test to prove he is the father

They had added: 'Our son is not the irresponsible and undignified person that you (Raffaella) have described. For some time .now you have been speaking to the public, to journalists and photographers.

'Obviously you have your reasons for making your life a media event, allowing TV cameras and reporters to follow you everywhere.'

As a result of the article in top selling Italian sports daily Gazzetta Dello Sport, the underwear model, who has also been linked to Cristiano Ronaldo, has filed a defamation action against them in a Milan court.

In a statement filed as part of the 
claim, Raffaella, said: 'in their open letter they insisted that I was 
motivated only by a desire for fame and money but Mario and I had a 
relationship which ended in April 2012. It was an intense and satisfying
love story that gave us our baby girl Pia.'

The
law suit could cost the elderly pensioners hundreds of thousands of 
Euros but no date for the hearing has yet been set and neither they nor 
Balotelli have commented on the legal action.

Raffaella and Balotelli, who left Manchester City in January for AC Milan, split after she learned of his womanising ways and she flew to Britain to confront him at his Cheshire home but he refused to see her and police were eventually called.

Baby Pia was born in December and Balotelli has not even seen her despite Raffaella urging him to do so but he has refused and is still insisting on a paternity test.

He has since found new love with model Fanny Neguesha and has posted pictures of the two of them on his Twitter account as well as one showing 'his and hers' football shirts with their names on the back and he has given her a £100,000 diamond engagement ring.

Raffaella has hit back by
posting pictures of herself sun bathing virtually naked ahead of the 
baptism ceremony for Pia on Sunday in a church close to her home in 
Naples.
