A transgender conman who pocketed £130,000 by tricking more than 100 people into buying shares in a fake company has been jailed for five years.

Frances Harris, 74, of Brighton, East Sussex, who was previously known as Frederick, persuaded investors to plough their savings into an investment opportunity backed by multi-millionaires.

She used the names of rich businessmen to lure in people, who were then sold shares in a bogus company called The Golden Age Project - which she claimed was based in Spain, but did not exist.

Jailed: Frances Harris, who was born a man (left) but lives as a woman (right), was sentenced to five years after being found guilty of fraud, money laundering and fraudulently claiming £27,000 in benefits, police said

By the time investors realised they 
had been deceived, the company had closed down. Harris was the leader in
the con, supported by a couple who helped launder the money 
through accounts.

Graham Lewis, Rosemary Nye and Harris set up Rest 
Assured Property Services in 2010 and sold timeshare apartments by 
phone. Victims paid a fee they were told was needed before a sale could 
be completed.

Around 100 people lost their life 
savings. Harris was also convicted of using his dead sister Pamela’s 
passport to illegally claim £27,000 in benefits - despite her dying 
around 50 years ago.

Harris, who has breast implants, 
gained £130,000 from the scam but his accomplices - husband and wife 
team Rosemary Nye and Graham Lewis - raked in more than £700,000 between
them.

Lewis, from Haywards Heath, was jailed
for four and a half years for four offences of fraud by false 
representation and eight offences of money laundering.

Nye, also from Haywards Heath, was 
sentenced to two years in prison, suspended for two years for one 
offence of fraud by false representation and five offences of money 
laundering.

People across the 
country reported losing a total of at least £500,000 which has never 
been recovered, a police spokesman said.

Defending Harris, Nicholas Fooks, said
his client could not complete the full physical change to become a 
woman because they had cancer.

He said: ‘He cannot complete the 
physical change from a man into a woman… The prison is trying its best 
to protect him but it’s impossible to protect him 24 hours a day.’

The court heard that mother-of-two Nye
and Lewis used the profits to go on a honeymoon to Dubai, as well as 
buy lavish gifts and fund their child’s driving lessons.

Defending Nye, Andrew Jefferies QC, 
said she only took part in the dishonesty because of her links to Lewis,
who she is now separated from.

‘She believed his background was in 
business,’ she said. ‘It was all plausible. She paints a pathetic 
figure.’ 

Jai Patel, defending Lewis, admitted he was the key person 
behind the cruel scam.

Harris was jailed for five years at 
Lewes Crown Court yesterday. Lewis was jailed for four-and-a-half years,
and Nye was handed a two-year suspended sentence and ordered to carry 
out unpaid work.

Sentencing the trio, Judge Shani 
Barnes said they had a ‘disregard’ for who they deceived. She added: 
‘Frances Harris, you were the head of this. It was executed like 
professionals. It was a sophisticated and long-term fraud.’

Detective Constable Julie Beckwith, of
the Sussex Police Major Fraud Unit, said the offences came to light in 
2010 when people across the UK started contacting police to say they had
been defrauded.

Officers soon realised that Sussex was
the centre for the operation. She said: ‘The defendants were operating from their addresses and at one point during the 2010/11 operation they were also using a rented office space in Crawley, essentially for receipt of mail.

‘We do admire the five victims, one of
whom was from Sussex, who were called by the prosecution and gave 
compelling evidence at the trial which helped show the jury the evil way
in which they were defrauded.

‘This case is a salutary reminder to 
everyone, especially the more elderly in our communities, not to be 
taken in by cold callers on the phone. Do not ever agree to anything 
there and then. Check it out, using legal advice, family and friends to 
help.
