Judge Peter Ross has blasted the UK Border Agency for handing out 170 bogus workers

Border chiefs have been blasted for ‘catastrophic’ failures over a £500,000 scam that allowed more than 170 bogus Pakistani workers and their relatives to illegally enter Britain.

A senior judge branded it a ‘scandal’ that the discredited UK Border Agency had handed out so many work permits to a company which even its own inspector warned was a front for a massive immigration racket.

The firm, Techsense UK, claimed it had lucrative IT contracts with private and public sector giants including Microsoft, BT and the NHS – even though a single phone call would have exposed this as a fraud.

Bosses told officials that they needed staff from their sister firm in Islamabad, Pakistan, to work in highly-skilled £40,000-a-year jobs at their plant in Milton Keynes.

But many of those who travelled to the UK on false pretences actually got jobs in fast food restaurants and stacking shelves in supermarkets.

In a highly unusual move, the judge hauled a senior border official into court to explain the scandal and accused the Home Office of attempting to cover up the fiasco to ‘spare their blushes’.

It is the second time in a week that the now-defunct Border Agency has been condemned by the courts over shocking failures.

Last Thursday, a vicar suspected of running Britain’s biggest sham marriage racket walked free last week after his £1million trial dramatically collapsed as a result of ‘serious misconduct’ by the former Home Office agency.

Two disgraced public servants, since suspended from duty, are facing criminal charges themselves after the case of Ugandan-born clergyman Reverend Nathan Ntege, 54, was thrown out of court.

The latest criticism from the judiciary is a huge embarrassment for the Home Office and raises urgent questions about the state of the nation’s beleaguered immigration controls.

Furious Judge Peter Ross said the agency was guilty of a ‘catastrophic failure to check the material provided’ by Techsense UK.

He said: ‘It is a scandal that no one checked with the organisations that were supposedly contracting with Techsense UK. Many of them were in the public sector. It would have been so easy but everything was just taken on the nod.

‘The applications kept coming time and time again. This was a company apparently growing exponentially and no one thought: “Hang on”.’

Incredibly, a Border Agency official who visited the Islamabad office placed the company on a ‘watchlist’ because he feared it was a front for an immigration racket.

But staff who were responsible for overseeing permits for Techsense UK were never alerted.

The judge said: ‘[The inspector] went to the Islamabad office and realised there was something seriously wrong, that this company was going to lose half its workforce to the UK and there didn’t even appear to be that number of people there go start with.’

‘Why when the company was placed on a so-called watchlist did no one bother to tell the case workers?’

Techsense UK was set up by Pakistani nationals Rashid Ghauri, 42, and Ali Junejo, 35, both of Milton Keynes, supposedly to contract IT work for other firms, Oxford Crown Court was told.

The pair submitted letters and emails to the Home Office claiming ‘partnerships’ with organisations including the NHS, Microsoft and IBM.

In fact, this so-called proof was actually welcome messages they had received for signing up to services on those companies’ websites and the contracts did not exist.

Despite this, the company was classified as ‘low-risk’ by the Home Office and awarded a licence to grant certificates of sponsorship – a significant step in someone being awarded a work permit.

Between 2009 and 2012, the UKBA handed out 117 certificates to Techsense UK. This led to 55 three-year visas being issued to people travelling from Pakistan supposedly to work for the loss-making company.

Prosecutors estimated that more than 120 family members were also granted visas to join them – making a total of at least 175 Pakistani nationals brought here illegally.

UKBA officials made two visits to the company’s offices in Milton Keynes and one to the plant in Islamabad, Pakistan, but no-one verified the existence of the supposedly lucrative IT contracts.

Ghauri and Junejo, the company directors, are estimated to have made at least £500,000 between them by selling the work permits for up to £4,500 each.

The pair may have got away with their duplicity had it not been for a separate tax investigation by HM Revenue and Customs which uncovered the scam.

Judge Ross also criticised the Home Office for failing to disclose vital information to the prosecution until the last day of the trial – jeopardising the entire case.

He said: ‘Whether it was to spare blushes or simply as a means of efficiency I don’t know.’

The Border Agency’s head of sponsorship unit, George Shirley, was hauled into the witness box to explain the debacle. He said the unit had ‘tightened up its checks’ on companies.

Ghauri was jailed for six years for fraud and money laundering and Junejo was imprisoned for six-and-a-half years.

The judge said: ‘You sought what was a wholly fraudulent application for a licence to grant sponsorship agreements, so that people who would not otherwise be entitled to enter the UK would come in to the UK and inevitably were able to stay here after. This was about making money.’

The UK Border Agency, which was axed last year after a series of scandals and replaced with UK Visas And Immigration and Immigration Enforcement. The UK Border Force was created after being hived off from the agency in 2012.
