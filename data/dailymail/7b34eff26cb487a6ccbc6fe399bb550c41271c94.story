The Bank of England fears that its top officials have been victims of a spying operation by US financial news agency Bloomberg, it emerged last night.

Senior members of the Bank, including Governor Sir Mervyn King, could have been targeted by employees of the news group to find out what stock market information they had been looking at on the company’s computer terminals.

Reporters could use such information to predict economic decisions that affect millions of people, such as printing more money or keeping interest rates down.

The revelations, slammed as ‘reprehensible’ by the Bank, come as central banks around the world are conducting inquiries to establish whether they have also been victims of the invasion.

Already, the Wall Street Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan – the country’s central bank – have said they believe they may have been targeted.

Reporters could also have spied on stock market data viewed by Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, the most powerful man in the financial world.

In a highly unusual and strongly worded statement, a Bank of England spokesman said: ‘The protection of confidential information is vital here at the Bank. What seems to have happened at Bloomberg is reprehensible.

'Bank officials are in close contact with Bloomberg, who have provided assurances to ensure that this does not happen again. We will also be liaising with other central banks on this matter.’

Bloomberg has admitted some reporters accessed private information.

In a message on the company’s website, 
editor-in-chief Matthew Winkler said: ‘Our reporters should not have 
access to any data considered proprietary. I am sorry that they did. The
error is inexcusable.’

Although it has a news agency, Bloomberg makes its money by renting the £13,000-a-year terminals to banks and traders.

They offer access to instant movements of global stock markets and a host of other real-time financial information.

Each user must log on but Bloomberg has admitted allowing reporters to snoop on information looked at on the machines – which could include central bankers.

Bloomberg said it had allowed journalists ‘limited’ access to sensitive and private data viewed by bankers. The snooping first came to light last week after Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs complained that journalists had tried to glean information from the data.

However, it is not thought any bank will be willing to part with the terminals, so vital are they to trading operations.

Although Goldman is not expected to sue, it is thought that the Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s data protection agency, could bring civil charges against Bloomberg. Last night, an ICO spokesman said: ‘We’re aware of this issue and will be learning more about what has happened, before considering what action, if any, needs to be taken.’

Founded in 1982 by Michael Bloomberg, now the mayor of New York, the privately owned group prides itself on its integrity. With more than 315,000 subscribers in 174 countries, it has established a near-stranglehold on the financial market.

It also employs more than 15,000 people in 192 locations, including 2,400 reporters who publish more than 5,000 stories a day from 146 bureaus.

Last year, the company, whose profits are taken into a trust and donated to charitable causes, reported annual revenue of more than £5billion.

Although Mr Bloomberg still owns a significant stake in the company, he was forced to put the firm into a trust when he entered politics.

The US government has been accused of flouting the American constitution after it secretly seized two months of phone records from journalists’ numbers.

The Associated Press news agency denounced the Justice Department’s operation as a ‘massive and unprecedented’ intrusion.

It said the seizure included outgoing calls from more than 20 numbers assigned to journalists in New York, Washington and Connecticut.

The government has refused to say why it demanded the records, but they cover April and May last year when AP reported a CIA operation in Yemen to foil an Al Qaeda plot to place a bomb on a US-bound airliner.

A criminal investigation into the leak is already underway.
