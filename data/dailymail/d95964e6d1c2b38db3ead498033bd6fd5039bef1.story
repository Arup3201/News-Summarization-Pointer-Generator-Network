Every girl wants a gorgeously kissable plump pout, and whatever the size or shape of your lips, it's easier to achieve than you think.

Everyone's been talking about Kylie Jenner's full-lipped look recently, which she puts down to 'clever make-up'.

So this week I've enlisted the help of top make-up artist Buster Knight, who taught me a quick and easy way to fake fuller-looking lips, using a bit of cosmetic trickery. Here's how we did it:

STEP 1 – Prep Your Pout

There's no point having a plump pout if your lips are going to be dry and chapped. Keep your lips moisturised by using a good quality lip balm daily – my favourite is the French Pharmacy classic Nuxe Reve de Miel Lip Balm. 

It offers intensive moisture, keeping lips looking smooth and feeling ultra-hydrated – not to mention its utterly delectable honey scent!

STEP 2 – Lined Lips

Firstly, take a lip pencil in a shade slightly warmer than your natural lip colour – I've gone for Clarins Lipliner Pencil in Bay Rose – and frame the outline of your lips to give them dimension and shape.

Take the pencil just outside your natural lip line to create a trick of shadow, making your lip shape appear fuller. Once you're happy with the shape you've outlined, gently blend the pencil inwards into your lips with a small brush so the effect remains natural looking.

Focus the lipliner on the outer corners of your lips to ensure the centre of your pout looks as full as possible. Feel free to reinforce the line with another layer of pencil after blending until you achieve the desired fullness.

 

STEP 3 – Trick Of Light

Next, apply a very light pink-toned lip pencil – or a cream concealer such as bareMinerals Correcting Concealer in Light 1 – onto the central area of your upper and lower lips, making sure not to go over the lip line you've already applied. This sneaky trick creates the illusion of light and will make your pout look extra plump.

Similarly, adding a touch of pearlescent highlighter such as Too Faced Candlelight Softly Illuminating Translucent Powder to your Cupid's bow will further accentuate your pout.

STEP 4 – Add Lipstick

Lighter lip colours close to your natural lip shade tend to work better than darker hues when it comes to faking fuller lips – think peachy nudes, pinks and browns. 

Dior Rouge Dior Nude Lip Blush in Grege, Clarins Rouge Eclat Lipstick in Nude Rose and DHC Premium Lipstick in Petal Pink are three of my favourite lippy options for creating a plumped-up pout.

Binky recommends using a concealer in order to create an illusion of light

Using a small lip brush, apply your chosen lip colour onto the lips. Blend the light concealer in the centre outwards slightly – without totally covering it – so it merges seamlessly into your lips. This should result in a natural looking yet gorgeously voluptuous pout!

STEP 5 – Get Glossy

Finally, if you want to go all out, there's no better product to add volume to the lips than a plumping gloss. 

Givenchy Gloss Interdit Ultra-Shiny Plumping Effect Lipgloss in Impertinent Nude provides the perfect shimmering veil to complement your plumper pout, imparting spectacular shine while instantly adding volume to the lips with its expert plumping formulation.

What's more, it doesn't leave your lips feeling sticky or gloopy like some glosses can – plus its fruity flavour will leave your pout feeling deliciously kissable as well as looking plumped-up to the max.

All the products used to create my plump pout this week are available at Escentual.com. You can really have fun with these tips, trying out different products, shades and textures for a wealth of lip looks. 

Remember though, make-up exists to enhance the natural beauty you already have – so don't go overboard!

Binky says that although you are trying to make your lips look bigger try not to go over board, enhance your natural features rather than get too carried away
