Mario Balotelli was filmed giving a group of Manchester United fans the finger following Liverpool's 2-1 defeat at Anfield on Sunday.

The 24-year-old striker was goaded with chants of '[Manchester] City reject' and 'what a waste a money' as he left Anfield before seemingly taking a picture of the fans and raising his middle finger and smirking. 

Balotelli endured another difficult afternoon in a Liverpool shirt as his brief cameo saw the Italian make headlines for the wrongs reasons after a heated exchange with United defender Chris Smalling.

The former AC Milan frontman had to be restrained by his own fans following a forceful challenge from Smalling which saw Balotelli launched into the advertising boards.

Balotelli, who looked to be making a beeline towards Smalling was held back by several Liverpool fans in a bid to calm the hothead striker down. 

Unfortunately for the Anfield faithful, it was to be Balotelli's most meaningful input into the game as Brendan Rodgers' side suffered defeat after two brilliant goals from Juan Mata enough to earn three points against 10-man Liverpool following Steven Gerrard's dismissal for a stamp on Ander Herrera.
