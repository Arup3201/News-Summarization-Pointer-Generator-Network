Roberto Martinez and Ruud Van Nistelrooy were interested observers as Holland trained for the final time before flying to Salvador for their opening World Cup game against Spain.

The Everton manager is in Rio de Janeiro ahead of his commentary role for ESPN when Argentina take on Bosnia on Sunday.

But he was spotted deep in conversation with Dutch legend Van Nistelrooy at the Estadio da Gavea - with the pair concealing their whispered conversation behind their hands.

Holland fly from Rio on Wednesday before taking on the defending champions two days later. Chile and Australia make up the rest of Group B.

The Dutch side were given a scare only two days before that start of the tournament when star striker Robin van 
Persie narrowly escaped serious injury after a bizarre accident 
with a kitesurfer while visiting Ipanema beach in Rio de Janeiro.

The
 Manchester United striker and his Holland team-mate Daryl Janmaat were left with 'light scratches and headaches' after colliding with the 
kitesurfer, according to the Dutch Football Association, who added 'but 
beyond that, there is nothing to worry about.'

Holland playmaker Wesley Sneijder has no such fitness concerns after enlisting the help of kickboxer Gokhan Saki to get him into shape.

The
 Dutch maestro was given permission by his club Galatasaray and national
 team coach Louis Van Gaal to train with Saki in Istanbul, where he is 
based during the domestic season.

And
 the results have been remarkable, with Holland’s physios in disbelief 
at Sneijder’s high level of fitness when the national side got together 
at the end of May. 

‘Thanks to him, I got back to my optimal
 weight, like when I was 22,’ said Sneijder. ‘In terms of footwork and 
agility, I am back to my old level.
