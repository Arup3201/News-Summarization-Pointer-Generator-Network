Canadian police say three Americans have died in a plane crash in northwestern Ontario.

Police said search and rescue squads located a downed Cessna 182 - a small propeller plane - just after 4 p.m. Friday on Chappie Lake, south of Kenora, Ontario.

Police say two people were found dead and the third victim died later of her injuries.

Killed: Lynn Bohanon, 36, (above) died in the crash along with 41-year-old Nikolas Rajala, and Teresa Rajala, 40

Loss: Lynn Bohanon, (above) was an avid outdoorswoman who loved to fly, fish and shoot

Canadian authorities identified the victims as 41-year-old Nikolas Rajala, 40-year-old Teresa Rajala, and 36-year-old Lynn Bohanon, all of Grand Rapids, Minnesota.

Police say the three were staying at a fishing lodge in the area, and were on a fishing trip when the crash occurred.

Mr Rajala was a self-employed logger who was flying on the day, according to Itasca County Commissioner Rusty Eichorn. The Star Tribune reports he had been flying since high school. His wife, Teresa was a was a retail sales clerk and a house cleaner.

The couple had bought the plane from Ms Bohanon, a pharmacist and avid outdoorswoman. 

Mr Eichorn, who had been dating Ms Bohanon for six years ago, told the Star Tribune: 'I loved her dearly. She died doing something that she loved to do, which is flying and fishing.'

Mr Eichorn described Mr Rajala as 'a good friend, an accomplished pilot. Whatever happened is catastrophic. It happens fast, and you don’t believe it… something went sideways on landing… it fades to black.' 

Ontario Provincial Police and the Canadian Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash.
