GAP has triggered a furious backlash after it tweeted a promotional image of an extremely slender model sporting a shirt dress to its 431,000 followers.

'Dress up your days in pastel plaid. #since1969' the retailer captioned the image on Monday - linking to the $59.95 dress on its website, where it appears on a different and notably less thin model.

'Look at the size of her head in proportion to her cadaver like body. Shame on you!' tweeted one user in response to the image GAP tweeted. 'Seriously, @Gap? In what world do people look like this? Perhaps you could select models who represent regular gals & not a skeletor ghost,' tweeted another.

Too thin? All-American retailer GAP has sparked a storm of criticism after it tweeted this image of a very slender model wearing a pastel plaid shirt dress (pictured) to its 431,000 followers on Monday

Different model: On GAP's website, the same 
dress it tweeted (left) is worn by a slender but noticeably healthier 
looking model (right) who is described by the retailer as wearing 'a 
regular U.S. size S'

Many users were quick to vent their disapproval, not only regarding the model's tiny frame, but the perceived state of her health.

'This picture is terrifying, looks like she needs a hamburger and some sunlight,' tweeted one.

Other adjectives used to describe the notably pale model included 'clammy Amish morlock,' 'zombie,' and 'concentration camp inhabitant.'

A few jumped to the model's defense, with one tweeting: 'Why is everyone so quick to call a skinny woman anorexic?' and another noting: 'Itâ€™s just as hurtful as telling a fat person to diet.'

The single only non-heated response to the photo was from one user, who tweeted: 'Just so dreamy!'

Disgust: Twitter users were quick to slam GAP's choice of model, labeling the image 'terrifying' and demanding the retailer use 'real women' in their ads

It is unclear why GAP opted to promote the dress on Twitter using a different model to the one used on their website; a redhead who is described as '5'10"/178 cm, waist 25"/64 cm, hips 35"/89 cm, wearing a regular U.S. size S.'

'Why is everyone so quick to call a skinny woman anorexic?'

In a statement to MailOnline, GAP spokesperson Edie Kissko said: '[Gap's intention] is always to celebrate diversity in our marketing and champion people for who they are. Customer feedback is important to us and we think this is a valuable conversation to learn from.'

GAP has refused to delete the Tweet, or issue any further comment on the matter via social media.
