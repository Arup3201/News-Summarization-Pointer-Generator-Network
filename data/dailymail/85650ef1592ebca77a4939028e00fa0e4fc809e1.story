The research, commissioned by Disneyland Paris to mark the launch of its new attraction Ratatouille - The Adventure on 10 July, also found more than half of Brits said the aromas of holiday destinations trigger lasting memories.

Professor Barry Smith, a sensory expert who worked with Disneyland Paris said: ‘More than any other sense, smell can evoke powerful, emotional memories. Whole scenes of people, places and things can be brought back to life by the mere hint of a long forgotten scent.

‘The rooms in a friend’s house, a boat trip, the sound of a voice, can all be conjured up by smell's power to reproduce the scenes for us.

‘The top 40 scents show a wide array of things that awaken our senses and stay with us for the rest of our lives.
