A mum who was once one of Britain's fattest women has described her 50-year battle with her weight, including once shedding 28 stone in 12 months.

Joan Thorpe, 58, from Wiltshire, says she was a 'human dustbin' who ballooned to over 38 stone as a teenager in response to the bullies who hounded her.

She was branded a 'big fat donkey' by cruel tormentors who would physically assault her - leading her to try and take her own life.

Joan Thorpe has endured a life-long struggle with her weight but has now lost 9st 4lb on doctor's orders

Now the mother-of-two has joined a campaign to stamp out weight discrimination after years of bullying from fellow classmates and even passersby shouting at her on the street.

Joan's weight gain began in childhood and resulted in a hip replacement operation because of her obesity when she was just 13.

She said: 'I was always a big child but when I hit my teenage years that's when this got really bad, the other pupils were so cruel to me.

'Every day I would get bullied, called names and have kids jumping on my back and smacking my bum, telling me I was just a big fat donkey and I would have to carry them through the school to our next class.

'I would have my lunch stolen off me while being told I was too fat and did not need to eat. In fact it got so bad that I tried to take my own life as I felt I could not go on.

'I was massive. I couldn't walk. I had to carry my belly around with me like of a sack of potatoes and had to go to bed after walking down the garden path because it made me so ill.

She was told her weight would make her infertile, but the mum-of-two is now a grandmother of twins, above

'I used to eat loads of junk foods - crisps, cake, chocolates, biscuits, pasties, chips - anything I could get hold of. I would just eat and eat and eat.

'I drank a lot of spirits and Coke. Not Diet Coke, I used to be really greedy. I was a human dustbin really. I just wanted to be left alone. Left alone to die.'

At 18, Joan was told by a doctor told her that she might die within two months unless she lost weight and she might never be able to have children.

She dropped from  28.6 stone to 9.4 stone in just one year after she went on a crash diet.

The mother-of-two says she has fought a life-long struggle against the fluctuating pounds and the taunts that have accompanied and caused them. 

The taunts did not stop after she left school, complete strangers have called her cruel names in the street throughout adulthood.

Joan has asked people to be kinder to those who are overweight in a new campaign ShowHeart, launched by Slimming World.

Joan has struggled with eating since she was a child and at her heaviest ballooned to 38 stone 

Joan said: 'People shouldn't have to be slim to be treated decently and with respect, though.

'I truly believe that if we want to tackle obesity as a society then we need to start being kinder to each other.

'Even in adult life, I used to walk down the street and people used to shout at me.'

Joan holds up her old jeans now that she's shed 9st to 13.6st after tipping the scales at 23st

In September 2013 she tipped the scales at 23 stone and a doctor again warned that her weight, and her consequent high blood pressure and diabetes, were endangering her health.

After joining Slimming World last autumn, Joan shed 9.4 stone, weighing in at a healthier 13.6stone, and a clothing size 18. 

Her confidence has blossomed since the pounds began dropping off again.

She said: 'I've got loads of confidence now. I can lift my head up and go outside every day now. Now I go for all the healthy options - salads, cereal, eggs.

'I hope Slimming World's ShowHeart campaign will encourage people to be kinder to overweight people and help those who are struggling with their weight to gain the confidence to seek help, whenever they feel ready.'

Two in three people admitted they turned to food for comfort after suffering discrimination - while only two per cent of people make healthy changes, according to Slimming World's survey of 2,573 overweight people.

And 40 per cent of overweight people feel the pain of humiliation, criticism or judgment at least once a week.

This treatment left people feeling ashamed, depressed and useless, the research showed.

The survey also showed that around 61 per cent of those questioned said they were more likely to be greeted by strangers with a smile since losing weight.

Slimming World's research specialist Professor James Stubbs said: 'As a society we need to think more about how we treat people who struggle with weight and we need to be more aware of how discrimination can impact on people's feelings and lifestyle behaviours.
