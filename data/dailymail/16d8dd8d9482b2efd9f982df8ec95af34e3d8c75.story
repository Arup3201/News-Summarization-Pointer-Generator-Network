These pictures show how a band of volunteers managed to rescue an elephant who had got herself in a tight spot by falling into a sewage drain.

The elephant cow had accidentally stepped into the three foot by four foot channel during the night at Ugab Rest Camp in Namibia and found herself in too deep to clamber out.

Guests and staff only found her the next morning and they quickly set about trying to help her.

I'm stuck! Guests and staff at the Ugab Rest 
Camp in Namibia found this elephant cow trapped in a sewage drain when 
they woke up one morning

Trapped: The elephant cow had accidentally 
stepped into the three foot by four foot channel during the night and 
found herself in too deep to clamber out

Tight spot: As this picture shows, the ditch was barely big enough for the trapped pachyderm to move her legs

Reaching for hoses and shovels they tried to keep her cool by dousing her in water and then coating her in dust.

But after help failed to arrive, the volunteers began shovelling sand and rock into the ditch in the hope they could raise it enough that she could step out.

Archie van der Merwe, who runs Laramon Tours, witnessed the elephant's 11 hour ordeal.

'We couldn't just stand around any longer and watch the animal suffer, so we decided that the rest camp's swimming pool pump could drain the water, which was knee deep,' he said.

'Then we filled it with sand and rock, so the elephant could get on higher ground.

Ahhh, refreshing! Volunteers keep the trapped elephant cool using a hose after they found her in the morning

The hot African sun: They then shovelled dust on to the trapped animal, also an attempt to stop her overheating

Resourceful: Volunteers drained the water from the ditch using the hose kept to fill the camp's swimming pool

Attempts: It was hoped that draining the knee-deep water could help her get a foothold to step out

A new plan: Sand and rocks are used to help the elephant climb clear of the sewage drain

Thanks: A rescuer keeps the elephant cool using a hose as she tries to work out how to climb from the ditch

Foothold! The elephant tried placing her feet in different spots around the drain to lift herself out

Here we go! After volunteers filled the ditch with rocks and sand, the elephant found a way up

Hard work: The elephant heaves her great mass from the tiny trench where she was trapped for so long

One step at a time: Volunteers sprayed her with water throughout to stop her from getting too hot in the sun

Gosh this is hard work: With three legs out of the ditch, she stops for a break to bask under the cool water

'Her knees were just under the point where she could bend them, so a little higher up would do the trick.

'After another hour under a very hot Namibian sun, the water was pumped out, the volunteers threw rocks into the hole to fill it up.

'She didn't want to move though, so they threw in sand too, compacting the stones until it was about a half meter higher.

'It was as if she understood what they were doing as she never tried anything aggressive toward them.'

Freedom! After several hours hard work, the elephant strolls clear of the sewage drain

Thanks guys: Volunteers kept up their spraying with the hoses to make sure she was not getting too hot

Grateful: One man at the scene said the elephant's good nature suggested she understood she was being helped

After three hours, the elephant suddenly came up on her hind legs and started to clamber out.

Mr Van der Merwe added: 'It was totally worth the effort.

'Everybody that helped with the rescue went to the swimming pool afterwards to cool themselves and have a drink to celebrate her rescue.'
