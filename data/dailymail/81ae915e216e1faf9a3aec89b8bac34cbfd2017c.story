Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany is anticipating a bright future for the club as they look to build on their Premier League successes' over the coming years.

Since the  Abu Dhabi United Group's takeover of City in 2008 they have turned themselves into a huge Premier League force, winning the title twice in the last three seasons.

And despite being heavily criticised for their transfer policy, spending hundreds of millions on top-class talent, Kompany insists the club's long-term future is bright and at the same time sustainable.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'This is a club that is investing in all the right places. Our success comes all the way from the top.

'From our owner, Sheikh Mansour, to our chairman Khaldoon, and all the way down to the players.

'The manager (Manuel Pellegrini) has played a big role in that, also. He is always calm, he never panics, and that message gets through to the players.

'I know City built up a negative ­reputation in the minds of some people, but if all the investment that has taken place isn't a statement of stability and commitment then I don't know what is.

'Nothing is short-term here. Everything is geared towards being successful now and in the future - and you can only do that if the club is stable.' 

The 28-year-old is well on his way to becoming the club's all-time most successful captain, so far winning  two Premier League titles, the Capital One Cup and the Community Shield as skipper.

Elsewhere, next up for the champions is a trip to Arsenal in the early game on Saturday as they look to close the three-point gap on the leaders Chelsea
