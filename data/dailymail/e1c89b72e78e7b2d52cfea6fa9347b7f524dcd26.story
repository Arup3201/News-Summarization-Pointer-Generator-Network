School absenteeism has plummeted to a record low following a crackdown on term-time family holidays. 

New official figures show that in total, England’s primary and secondary pupils missed 35.7 million days of school in the autumn and spring terms of 2013/14 - down around 4.2 million from the same two terms the year before.

The overall authorised absence rate - time off approved by schools - alone has dropped from 4.3per cent to 3.5per cent, with statisticians suggesting that this is due to a decrease in illness and agreed family holidays.

In total, 2.5 million school days were lost because of family holidays, both those authorised by the school and unauthorised, down 0.8 million from 3.3 million the year before.

Government officials suggested that this drop was down to former Education Secretary Michael Gove's tough new rules on holidays which mean that headteachers can now only grant permission for trips during term time in 'exceptional circumstances'.

Previously, school leaders could grant up to 10 days leave a year for family holidays in special circumstances.

The change, which was brought in last September, has proved controversial, with opponents arguing that some families are unable to, or cannot afford to take breaks during school holidays.

And the figures note a 'small increase' in family holidays that have not been approved by the school, suggesting that some parents are deciding to take family trips despite not gaining the school’s approval.

The latest data also shows a fall in time missed due to illness, the most common reason for absence, with 2.7per cent of half days lost for this reason in the autumn and spring terms, down from 3.3per cent the year before.

School Reform Minister Nick Gibb said: 'Our plan for education is getting more young people than ever before back in class, helping thousands more to fulfil their potential and realise their aspirations.

'Missing lessons can be hugely damaging to a pupil’s education - but today’s figures show more pupils than ever before are getting the best preparation for life in modern Britain.'

The truancy, or unauthorised absence rate has also fallen slightly to 0.9per cent from 1per cent, the statistics reveal.

And fewer youngsters are being classed as 'persistently absent'.

Around 262,255 pupils missed 15per cent of lessons in the autumn and spring terms of 2013/14 - down from 439,105 who were in this category five years ago.

A pupil who misses at least 15per cent of school time throughout their school career loses out on around 18 months of lesson time, the Department for Education said, damaging their chances of fulfilling their potential.

Parents are legally responsible for ensuring children aged five to 16 attend school regularly, unless they are home educated.

Headteachers, social workers or police can issue parents with penalty notices of up to £120 if a child regularly misses school, and their parents have not taken action or asked for help.

If this is not paid a prosecution will follow, which can lead to a fine of up to £2,500, a community sentence, or even a three-month jail term.

Changes: Former Education Secretary Michael Gove's reforms on school holidays in term time were brought in last September, and truancy fines have also risen

Council officials say that, aside from their education suffering, children who are often absent find it harder to sustain friendships, and are more likely to get involved with crime. 

The Government has insisted that its reforms to deal with school absence are starting to have an effect.

Under the changes, truancy fines have risen from £50 to £60, and from £100 to £120 if they are not paid within 28 days. Guidance on school holidays has also changed, with headteachers now only granting permission for term time trips in 'exceptional circumstances'.
