Apple CEO Tim Cook has boasted that over a million people  signed up to Apple Pay in the first week

Apple CEO Tim Cook has hit back at two major retailers who blocked the firm's new mobile phone payment system Apple Pay, claiming over a million users have signed up to the service in the first week.

Drugstore chains CVS and Rite Aid both last week stopped customers using the new service which lets users pay for goods by holding a smartphone close to a specially designed terminal.

But Mr Cook said there were plenty of other retailers around the world signing up, claiming Apple Pay already totes up more transactions than all other 'contactless'
payment methods combined.

Such services have failed
to catch on in the United States despite the backing of Google
Inc and other influential players.

News emerged over the weekend that the two retailers had
opted out of Apple Pay in favor of a rival system that roughly
50 chains, including Wal-Mart and Best Buy, are developing for
in-house use.

'We've got a lot more merchants to sign up, we've got a lot
of banks to sign up and we've got the rest of the world,' Cook
told the Wall Street Journal Digital Live conference, in the
company's most extensive comments on the blockade so far.

In launching Apple Pay, the iPhone maker hopes to lock in
more customers for its mobile devices by enhancing their overall
utility. 

Industry experts say it stands a chance of becoming thefirst widely used payments feature on smartphones.

Blocked: Drugstore chains CVS and Rite Aid have stopped users from using the new system last week

CVS and Rite Aid have not explained their surprise move. But the driving force behind developing a retailer-owned mobile
payment solution is to avoid paying credit card transaction fees
to card companies like Visa and Mastercard,
analysts said. 

Fees range between 2 percent and 3 percent of
costs per transaction.

Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch.

The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button.

This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card.

All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely.

If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service.

Rite Aid stopped accepting Apple Pay last week at its 4,572
stores. Spokeswoman Ashley Flower said the company was
evaluating various forms of mobile payment technologies.

CVS did not respond to queries seeking comment but a visit
to two of its stores showed that the NFC (Near Field
Communications) reader on which Apple Pay was used had been
deactivated.

It remains to be seen, despite early signs of success,
whether mobile payments will become widely adopted.

Cook argued on Monday that Apple Pay offered better security
and privacy than competing services, and that retailers risked
alienating customers by limiting choices at checkout.

'It's a skirmish,' Cook said in response to a question about
the retailers' moves.

'Merchants have different objectives sometimes. But in the
long arc of time, you only are relevant as a retailer or
merchant if your customers love you.'
