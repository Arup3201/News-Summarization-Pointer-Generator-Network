Two great penpals who have been writing to each other across the Atlantic for almost 70 years are to stage an emotional get-together next weekend.

The incredible friendship of Briton Muriel Cowley and American Peggy Shafer spans seven decades, 3,500 miles and hundreds of handwritten letters.

The two soulmates were 10-year-old schoolgirls when they started swapping tales about their schools, siblings and hobbies just weeks after D-Day as the Second World War raged.

Mrs Shafer, 79, who lives near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with her husband, Dave, wrote her first letter to Muriel, of Attleborough, Norfolk, on August 22, 1944. 

Thrilled Muriel wrote back weeks later - having turned 11 - to tell her new buddy that she was a proud Brownie and had a sister, a brother, a cat and a dog.

And she told her how she loved art, needlework and reading best.

Mrs Cowley, also 79, said: 'My neighbour was in the army and he was posted to America to help build defences against the Japanese.

He got to know the people out there and one of the men had a teenage daughter, Hazel, and she asked my neighbour if he could find a penfriend. 

'He wrote to his wife and she suggested my sister as they were closer in age.

'But Hazel had a friend, Peggy, and she wanted to write, too.

'When I was 10 years old, I had a great family life.

'My father was in charge of refuelling the flying boats and it was a top priority job and I was very lucky that I didn't have someone in active service.'

She added: 'Peggy and I wrote about school.

'I just used to love writing.

'We couldn't do much in those days because of the blackouts.'

Muriel also wrote about the tough sweet ration in the war-battered UK and how pleased she was that it was being introduced as it meant everyone was able to have some.

The two girls soon found out that they had a lot in common and formed an amazingly strong friendship and bond that has lasted a lifetime.

'We were both born in the same month of the same year.

'We had the same initials - Muriel Herman and Margaret Hicks - and we both had a brother and a sister,' said Muriel.

'We both married naval personnel whose fathers had both died when they were tiny and were brought up by stepdads.'

The two friends married a year and a day apart and their daughters were born within months of each other, followed by their sons.

Unbeknown to each other, they have also separately booked cruises to the Norwegian fjords to celebrate their 80th birthdays in September.

Muriel, who moved to Norfolk from Dorset in 1995, said: 'In the 40s it took time for things to get over to the States.

The two, Muriel, left, and Peggy, right, met in 1994 in Norwich to celebrate 50 years of friendship. 'We are still very close,' says Mrs Cowley

'It wouldn't have been taken over by aircraft, it was by boat.

'I remember the first present she sent me - it was a bandana.

'I loved it and I wore it everywhere.'

The pair first met in 1974 - 30 years after they struck up their astonishing rapport - when Muriel flew out to America.

'It was incredible,' she said. 

'She carried a rose for recognition but she didn't need it.

'It was like meeting family, we were made to feel so welcome.

'I had to make a little dictionary for myself for the different words.

'A faucet is a tap, drapes are blinds and a trunk is the boot of a car.'

The two have shared dozens of photos amid their correspondence so each knows each other's family history inside out. Here Peggy is photographed with husband David Shafer and their family

Muriel and Peggy last met on a shopping trip to New York in 2004.

The two great friends have supported each other through difficult times, including the loss of Muriel's son, Robert, who sadly died four years ago.

'Peggy is my oldest friend and we really have grown up together.

'We are still very close,' said Mrs Cowley.

The silver-surfing grandmothers have both embraced the supersonic cyber age and they now email each other across the Atlantic.

To celebrate their 69 years of extraordinary friendship, Peggy and her husband Dave are visiting Muriel for an extra-special high tea, which is being organised by her daughter, Elizabeth Cowley-Gwilliams.

They will enjoy champagne, cakes and sandwiches in Ms Cowley-Gwilliams's garden in Banham, Norfolk. 

Some of their early letters and photos will be on display for family and friends to see.

Muriel's first letter to Peggy

Dear Peggy,

I received your letter this morning, first I will write about myself. 

I have brown plaits and brown eyes and I live in a small town. My birthday is the 12th of September and I was 11 this year.

I have a sister and a brother, Janette and Peter, I also have a cat and a dog.

I am in fourth grade at school and I like best reading, art and needlework, what are your favourite lessons?

I am not a Girl Guide but I do belong to the Brownies, do you have Brownies? It is when you are too young for the Girl Guides.

We gave your address to a little friend of ours, but I would like to get a letter from you.I will close now with lots of love, 

Muriel xxx
