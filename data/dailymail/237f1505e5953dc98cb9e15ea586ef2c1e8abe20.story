From the daily threat of doodlebugs to rationing and the strain of being forced to watch loved ones go off to fight, World War Two was a perilous time for Britain.

And yet, for one group, the war proved an opportunity. For British ballet, once a niche pursuit, the years of grinding conflict offered a chance to show their mettle and become entwined with the cultural fabric of the nation.

And as David Bintley, the director of the Royal Birmingham Ballet, explains in a new BBC4 documentary, the war years proved to be 'the making of British ballet'.

Early days: Ninette de Valois with a group of students, some of the first she taught, in 1928

The driving force behind the scheme to turn what had once been a largely foreign art form into something quintessentially British was Ninette de Valois.

A former dancer herself, de Valois had enjoyed a glittering career - complete with a stint at Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, then the world's best dance outfit.

She was convinced that the artistic excellence she had been immersed in during her time at the Ballets Russes could be replicated in a British ballet company, and in 1931, she set up the Vic-Wells Company with the help of the formidable theatre impresario, Lilian Baylis.

'She was one of the few Englishwomen to 
dance with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and when she was in Diaghilev's 
company, she was surrounded by all these great dancers, teachers and of 
course, artists,' explains the Royal Ballet School's Anna Meadmore.

'She could have stayed with the Ballets Russes much longer
 than she did - she was only 28 when she left - and I think she left 
when she did because it had filled her so much with the absolute 
conviction that we had to create in this country a school and company 
that could give rise to the sort of artistry she had seen at the Ballets 
Russes.'

By the mid-1930s, de Valois had put together a roster of talent that included dancers Margot Fonteyn and Robert Helpman, and choreographer Frederick Ashton, who would go on to create works of such excellence, they still influence ballet today.

But it wasn't until war broke out in 1939 that de Valois' fledgling ballet company truly came into its own - transforming the art from a niche pursuit for the posh into an everyman pleasure in the process.

'I think for highbrow audiences, ballet 
was well established,' adds Meadmore. 'But for the man in the street, it was still very 
much peripheral, exotic, something they wouldn't consider going to 
themselves.

'It was for the tiara set, not mass entertainment and certainly not 
understood as being part of national culture at all.'

When war broke out on 3rd September 1939, de Valois decided to send her company, by now renamed after the Sadler's Wells Theatre where they were based, on tour.

'Madam [de Valois] gathered us together and said we were going
 on tour,' explains Julia Farron, a dancer at the company between 1936 and 1961.

' I think it was actually the making of the company because 
we were doing at least seven performances a week unlike in London where 
you did two. It was hard work but that's how you learn.'

V&A ballet historian, Jane Pritchard, agrees. 'Everything 
changed with the outbreak of war,' she explains.

'You'd wait for this shattering crash and
 you'd usually swear, as much as one could swear in those days, and then 
you'd rush back up to the dressing room and get on with your make-up'

'Obviously, the companies immediately 
stopped performing but that was only for a brief period because it was 
quickly realised that people needed entertainment more than ever during 
wartime.

'Dance companies got going and remained active as much, if not 
more, than other forms of entertainment throughout the War.'

Despite the need for entertainment, many of the male dancers were conscripted, as was choreographer Ashton.

Nevertheless, with their scores adapted for piano by the company's Director of Music, Constant Lambert, and their repertoire reworked to omit male dancers, the company went on the road, touring the length and breadth of Britain and creating new fans in the process.

Later, the company returned to a new London home, the New Theatre, or, as it's known today, the Noel Coward Theatre. But as for those elsewhere, life for the Sadler's Wells dancers was perilous.

'We had watchers on the roof and there were three whistles,' explains Gillian Lynne, a former ballerina, remembers of her time dancing during the Blitz.

'If it was one whistle, it meant take care, the doodlebug's coming. Two meant danger, go to the shelter downstairs, and three meant "get onto the stairs!" and you'd wait for this shattering crash and you'd usually swear, as much as one can swear at that age, and then you'd rush back up to the dressing room and get on with your make-up.'

'There was a lot of gunfire,' adds fellow dancer Pauline Clayden. 'We could hear the guns going when they tried to shoot the bombers down. That made quite a racket.'

Despite the best efforts of the Luftwaffe, the company continued to dance - and tour - right up until the end of the war.

Thanks to their work, ballet was no longer seen as a pursuit purely for the tiara brigade and with the help of economist, John Maynard Keynes, the dancers were about to get their reward.

Keynes, then the chairman of the Council for Arts and Music, was, according to Meadmore 'determined to bring them into theatreland'.

And so, on 20th February 1946, the Sadler's Wells Ballet company made their debut in their new home, the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden.

The ballet was Sleeping Beauty and watching from the Royal Box was King George VI, his wife Queen Elizabeth, and the two princesses Elizabeth and Margaret.

For the dancers themselves, it was both exhilarating and nerve-wracking. 'It was terribly exciting, especially as the Royal Family were there as well,' reveals Clayden,

'It [Covent Garden] was so huge,' adds fellow dancer, Julia Farron. 'We'd always been in some small theatre before that!'

The show was a huge success and by 1956, Nina de Valois' little dance outfit had officially become the Royal Ballet, the UK's national ballet company.

'The War made people want to go and see that kind of thing, want to go and support it,' adds Gillian Lynne. 'I think the war did a great deal for ballet.'
