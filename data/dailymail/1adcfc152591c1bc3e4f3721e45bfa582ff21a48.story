These are the two brave little battlers who have both beaten eye cancer.

Identical twins Isla and Grace Devine have both undergone a mammoth battle for survival after both being diagnosed with the deadly disease just twelve months after they were born.

They have undergone gruelling treatment and Grace has lost one eye - but both have come out the other side smiling.

Mother Laura Pollard, 25, said: ‘It was such an unlucky thing to happen, that both the twins had eye cancer. But we feel incredibly lucky to be in this position now.

‘It’s incredible to see what they have been through - and they have both come through the other side.'

Ms Pollard, who lives with partner Alan Devine, 38, a train guard, in Morpeth, Northumberland, had been thrilled when she discovered she was pregnant with twins.

She said: ‘I’m a twin myself, but I never imagined that I would fall pregnant with twins myself. When the sonographer said she could see two heartbeats on the scan, it was such a surprise.’

Her pregnancy went smoothly and she gave birth to twins Isla, weighing 6Ib2, and Grace, weighing 5Ib11, at Wansbeck General hospital in Ashington, in December 2011.

But when 
the twins were celebrating their first birthday, she took a photo of 
them and noticed that Grace’s left eye wasn’t quite straight. She 
mentioned it to her health visitor and asked for a referral for a 
hospital check up.

She
 was referred to the opthamology department at the local hospital, who 
referred her for more tests at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in 
Newcastle.

She said: ‘I knew that something wasn’t quite right with Grace’s eye, but I never imagined it would be anything serious.’

The 
consultant who carried out the tests on Grace said that he had seen 
something behind her eye and wanted to examine her further under a 
general anaesthetic.

The operation was carried out the 
following morning and then doctors broke the devastating news to the 
couple that Grace had retinoblastoma, a childhood eye cancer.

‘We were completely stunned. We had never even heard of this eye 
cancer, and we had never imagined that it could be anything like 
cancer.  At that point it never occurred to us that Isla could have it 
as well - we were only thinking of how Grace was going to get through 
it.’

Further
 tests showed that Grace had multiple tumours in her left eye and they 
were graded E, the most serious form of the disease. She was blind in 
that eye and had been for months. She also had tumors in her right eye 
too. Doctors told the couple that they had to make a heart rendering 
decision. The only way to save Grace’s life was to remove her eye.

‘It was devastating for her to lose her eye. But it was the only way to save her life. It was the worst decision we have had to make, but there was no choice. It was her eye or her life.’

A week later, in April last year, the operation was carried out at Birmingham Children’s Hospital, and she had a metal implant put in.

The following day Isla was checked by doctors, and they made the devastating discovery that she had eye cancer too, in both her eyes.

Retinoblastoma - cancer of the retina - is a rare type of eye cancer which usually affects children younger than five.

The disease causes the retina cells to grow quickly and out-of-control.

While treating it usually involves laser treatment, freezing the tumour or heat therapy, larger tumours can require chemotherapy, or surgery to remove the eye.

However, more than 98 per cent of children with retinoblastoma are successfully treated.

Signs to look out for include:

* A white eye or white reflection which can be seen in a photograph

* A squint

* A red sore or swollen eye

* A change in colour to the iris

* Deterioration in vision

‘It was too much to take in. We were in utter shock. We’d just had one child lose her eye, and now we were being told our other daughter had it too. The thought of two children having cancer was just horrendous.’

Luckily Isla’s cancer wasn’t as far advanced as her sister, so she didn’t have to have an eye removed. She underwent six months of chemotherapy which finished in September.

Ms Pollard said: ‘She coped really well. She was sick and exhausted and she lost her hair. But she managed to come through it. We are very proud of them both.’

Grace also had laser treatment on her remaining eye to shrink the tumours, and recent check-ups have shown the tumours are now dormant in both the girls.

‘It is such a relief that they are both doing so well. The tumours are dormant and they do have monthly check-ups.

‘They have so much more energy now, Isla especially now she has finished her chemotherapy.

‘It was such a relief that I asked the health visitor to check Grace when I did, because it wouldn’t have been picked up otherwise. And having Grace treated has saved Isla too.

‘When I look at the two of them together it’s very emotional, knowing what they have been through. And I feel like the luckiest mum in the world to have them both with me.’

Mr Devine added: ‘it’s wonderful that both the girls have come through the other side of eye cancer. It was frightening when they were first diagnosed with it. To have them both battle through it has been extremely difficult. But thankfully both the girls are now doing really well. We are very proud of them both.
