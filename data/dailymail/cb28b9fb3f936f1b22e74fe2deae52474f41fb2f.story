It has been revealed that the former police officer accused of killing a man in a movie theater during a dispute over texting had used his own phone to send a message to his son moments before the incident.

According to documents released Thursday by Florida prosecutors, Curtis Reeves' son, Matthew Reeves, told detectives that his father texted him at 1.04pm on January  13- just moments before Curtis shot Chad Oulson dead.

Curtis Reeves told his son he was already seated inside the theater.

Matthew Reeves, who is a Tampa police officer, made plans to meet his parents at the theater for the 1.20pm showing of 'Lone Survivor' but was late because he stopped to wash his truck, he told detectives.

Texting problem: Curtis Reeves, seen in court on February 7, shot another moviegoer dead 'because the man wouldn't stop texting' but new records show that Reeves had also sent his own text just moments before

Matthew Reeves said he had walked into the dark theater while the previews were playing and looked around for his parents.

 It was that moment, investigators said, that Reeves shot 43-year-old Oulson.

'Matthew
 said he did not see the shot directly, but the noise and light drew his
 attention to the top row of seats,' Pasco County Sheriff's detective 
Aaron Smith wrote.

Matthew Reeves tried to help Oulson by pressing a stranger's T-shirt against Oulson's bleeding chest wound.

Curtis
 Reeves, 71, was charged with second-degree murder. He also was charged 
with aggravated battery; authorities say the bullet that struck and 
killed Oulson also struck Oulson's wife, Nicole, in the finger as she 
tried to shield her husband.

Revealing: Court documents prove that Matthew Reeves, seen here with his mother on February 7, had received a text from his father just minutes before his dad shot another person in the theater

Reeves has pleaded not guilty to both counts. If convicted, he faces a mandatory minimum of 25 years in prison.

Reeves
 is being held without bail in the Pasco County Jail. His attorneys say 
Reeves acted in self-defense. Reeves told police that Oulson hit him in 
the face, possibly with a cellphone. Other witnesses, including Reeves' 
wife, say they never saw Oulson strike Reeves.

Reeves'
 attorneys did not immediately return a call for comment regarding the 
hundreds of pages of newly released discovery evidence documents. A 
judge ruled Wednesday that the documents could be released publicly.

In
 early February, the evidence was sealed from the public for 30 days so 
Reeves' attorneys could review it and perhaps challenge all or parts of 
its release to the public.

Victim: Chad Oulson (center, with his wife Nicole and their daughter) was shot and killed in the movie theater and his shooter's son Matthew, a police officer, came to help try to put pressure on the wound

Also injured: Mrs Oulson, seen in court on Wednesday, was also hit by the bullet and it struck her finger as she tried to shield her husband, so Reeves is being charged with aggravated battery in addition to second-degree murder

They had no challenges Wednesday, largely because much of the information was released during a two-day bond hearing.

A chunk of the documents are from Reeves' personnel file from his decades as a Tampa police officer.

Reeves
 regularly received outstanding evaluations and numerous letters of 
commendation for leadership skills and for training he led on gun safety
 and other topics. He retired in 1993.

The
 file also contains an interview with Jamira Dixon, a 35-year-old woman 
who said that in December, Reeves became upset with her because she was 
texting in the same movie theater.

During
 the incident, she said, Reeves complained to a manager, then continued 
to stare at her throughout the movie and made her feel uncomfortable.

The
 documents also offer witness interviews of the January 13 shooting. 
They reveal the chaos and confusion in the theater when Oulson was shot.

Edward
 McFadden, 76, told Pasco County Sheriff's detective Matthew Myers that 
he was seated in the theater and heard a loud noise behind him.

'He
 told me it sounded like a gunshot, but he wasn't sure if it was real or
 from the previews because they had just shown a preview for Robocop, 
which had a lot of gunshots in it,' McFadden said.
