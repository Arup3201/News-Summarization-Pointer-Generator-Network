An alleged stalker is accused of bombarding Lindsay Lohan with more than 1,000 messages and punching a bouncer who barred him from seeing her rehearse for her West End comeback.

Daniel Vorderwulbecke will face trial over the altercation at London's Playhouse Theatre, where the Hollywood star made her stage debut last month in David Mamet's satire Speed-The-Plow.

It is claimed the 37-year-old, who goes by names including King Lionheart and DJ Dan Cortez, sent Miss Lohan thousands of text messages.

Claims: The charges say Vorderwulbecke damaged a bin at the Playhouse Theatre (pictured), where the play is currently showing, before returning three days later and having an altercation with the doorman

He also claims to speak to the actress personally and through social media every day, a court heard. 

Today he was bailed to the specialist Gordon Hospital for mental health patients in Pimlico, central London, where specialists will prepare a psychiatric report ahead of his trial.

His lawyer, Patrick McGovern, said he was probably ‘unfit to plead’ due to his mental health. It is not known what condition Vorderwulbecke is reported to have.

It is claimed Vorderwulbecke stalked Miss Lohan for seven weeks between July and September this year by bombarding her with threats in person and through 'various communication devices' including Instagram.

On September 8, police were called to the Playhouse Theatre, where Vorderwulbecke had allegedly caused damage to a metal cigarette bin valued at £100.

Three days later, on September 11, he allegedly assaulted security worker Cameron Ashrat.

A short hearing today before Westminster magistrates', which Vorderwulbecke did not attend, was adjourned until January 15 for the further reports to be drawn up. 

Magistrate Avrill Newman said: 'The defendant shall be tried on 15 January with a pre trial hearing on November 27.

'He is released on bail to reside at [a] psychiatric hospital... and be accompanied by a qualified medical officer at all times.'

Messages: The defendant is accused of abusing her via Instagram, where Miss Lohan posted this selfie today

Social: Miss Lohan has been out in London including at the Chiltern Firehouse restaurant last night (above)

Well-earned rest: The actress was seen leaving the popular celebrity haunt with a male companion last night

Vorderwulbecke, whose address was given as the Gordon Hospital, is charged with assault, harassment and criminal damage. He has not yet entered a plea.

A former star of The Parent Trap and Mean Girls, 28-year-old Miss Lohan made her West End debut last month after years of making more headlines for arrests and rehab than her acting.

She split critics, many of whom were positive but some of whom laid into her with full force.

The Daily Mail's Quentin Letts slammed the choice of the actress in Speed-the-Plow, a satire about the barrel-scraping of Hollywood film-makers, as a 'travesty of art', while Mark Shenton of The Stage said the production strayed into self-parody. 

Popular: Miss Lohan also visited the Chiltern Firehouse restaurant last week after one of her performances

Socialising: Miss Lohan leaving the exclusive Nobu restaurant in London's Park Lane last week

Since coming to the capital she has been active in its social set, dining out at exclusive restaurants including the Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, Nobu in Mayfair and Nozomi in Knightsbridge.

In a nod to her more sedate party lifestyle, she has been seen backstage with members of her doting family, including her mother Dina and younger siblings Michael Jr, 26, and Ali, 20.
