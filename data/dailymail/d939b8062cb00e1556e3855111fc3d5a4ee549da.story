Nash Grier, 15, name may not be as well-known as Ellen Degeneres, Miley Cyrus, or Justin Bieber but the North Carolina teen has more followers than any of them Vine.

Grier has taken around 125 of the 6-second, looping videos since April—a total of just 12 minutes of footage—but has already gained a following of 1.4 million.

That makes the high school sophomore the 25th most followed person of the service’s over 40 million registered users after just over six months of posting videos, mostly of him and his friends in goofing off.

Popular guy: Nash Grier is the 25th most popular user of video sharing app Vine. He's pictured here with his 4-year-old sister in a Vine, which like many features his family goofing off

Grier was a typical user with your average following of friends and family until July, when another high school Vine savant, Tiffiny Semashko of Arkansas, shared one of Nash’s vines with her 300,000 followers.

Three weeks later, Grier’s account had reached 200,000 followers.

‘It just kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and just hasn’t stopped,’ Grier told the Charlotte Observer.

But asked what his secret is, Grier is likely at a loss.

Goofing off: In about 6 months, Grier managed to gain 1.4 million followers on Vine with the help of hysterical videos like Stair Diving, which shows his brother crashing down a set of stairs in a baby pool while wearing football gear

It could be his penchant for making visual puns that spin off from youth culture. In one Vine, he cuts into Katy Perry’s Roar video and growls at the camera while holding a tiny purring kitten.

The adorable factor may be at play. A Vine that guest stars Grier's 4-year-old sister Skylynn singing the Black Eyed Peas' Boom Boom Pow garnered 375,000 likes and 300,000 shares.

Or perhaps its Grier’s ability to catch moments of kids just being kids, as he does in a Vine that features his 13-year-old brother Hayes cascading down their home’s staircase in full football padding while inside an empty baby pool.

‘Stair diving,’ Grier says to the camera as he suddenly appears in the frame.

Whatever the recipe, it is a successful one.

Grounded: Media firms eager to monetize the social media savant's success call him with offers almost daily, but his dad says he just wants 'Nash to be Nash'

In addition to his impressive Vine following, Grier boasts 82,000 Twitter followers and a whopping 230,000 followers on Instagram.

His success may also pay off financially. The teen has been approached by international media firms like London-based Viral Spiral, who imagine web series spinoffs and even merchandise in an attempt to monetize what is still basically a hobby.

While Grier gets calls nearly every day from such companies, his dad Chad wold prefer his son remain a regular kid while he still can.

‘We’re going to have to put an end to it,’ Chad told the Observer. ‘I want Nash to be Nash.’

Recipe for success? 'Usually the dumber we look, the funnier it is,' Grier says
