Spain aren't taking Slovakia lightly, if their press is anything to go by, as Vicente del Bosque's side prepare to face the only other side to win their opening Group C match.

In particular, the 2010 World Cup winners single out Liverpool's Martin Skrtel as a 'Hard nut to crack' on the cover of Marca.

They also refer to the tough Slovak defender and his national team captain as an 'ogre'. 'Spain are playing to remain leaders against 'ogre' Skrtel's Slovakia,' Marca writes. 'La Roja will find a small and crowded stadium' in Bratislava.

Slovakia captain Martin Skrtel is a 'hard nut to crack', says Spain's Marca, while Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi will be on show for Ballon d'Dor voters next time Real Madrid face Barcelona, says Mundo Deportivo

Chelsea's Diego Costa starts and will be chasing his first goal in five games for his country after a red hot start to his Premier League career.

Mundo Deportivo is getting in early ahead of the next clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona.

Real have a La Liga meeting with Levante and Liverpool in the Champions League before the October 25 El Clasico, but it's already being slated as a significant fixture to help decide this year's world player of the year.

Calling the match a 'Golden El Clasico', the paper writes: 'The game at the Bernabeu will be important for the Ballon d'Or.

'Cristiano [Ronaldo or Real] and [Barcelona's Lionel] Messi will fight together for it along with [Bayern Munich's Arjen] Robben, [Barca's] Neymar and the Germans'

Atletico Madrid's Koke weighs in on the Ronaldo or Messi debate: 'Cristiano is an athlete, but Messi is God.'

AS leads on Real keeper and Spain captain Iker Casillas being ready and raring to lead Spain in Bratislava against Slovakia, 'the most difficult team in the group.'

LaGazetta dello Sport has Roma president James Pallotta saying his team are Serie A contenders, while Iker Casilla fires up to lead Spain against Slovakia in AS

They list Spain's starting line-up as: Casillas; Juanfran, Pique, Albiol, Jordi Alba; Koke, Busquets, Cesc; Silva, Diego Costa, Iniesta

And in LaGazetta dello Sport, Roma president James Pallotta is talking up his side's chances of beating Juventus to the Serie A title.

'My Roma is stronger than Juve,' he is quoted saying. 'We played better than them without [Daniele] De Rossi and [Kevin] Strootman, how can I not believe in the Scudetto?'
