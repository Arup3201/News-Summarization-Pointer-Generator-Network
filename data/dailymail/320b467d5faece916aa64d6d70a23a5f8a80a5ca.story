A Chinese teacher has been drawing on his experience to help students learn more about the world around them.

Middle school geography teacher, Wang Boming, is one of the world’s best free-hand map drawers. He uses his unique talent in his classes to sketch incredibly accurate maps of the world by memory in an incredible four minutes, Shanghaiist website said.

Wang Boming, a former art education major from Sha'anxi province, said he practised sketching out countries and continents all the time while he was in middle school. Now every day he continually sits in his office studying the globe and practising his drawing skills, so that he can make his maps perfect and precise.

Wang Boming begins sketching his map of the world on the blackboard

Teaching a class of 60 students at his school in Ningxia, China, Wang starts his lesson by drawing a map of the world on the blackboard. While drawing the map he speaks to his students about each country or continent he’s drawing. 

Four minutes later a complete map of the world is on the blackboard, a feat that drew gasps and a round of applause from his students.

 'I used to think that geography was boring but when he drew the map it made the class livelier,' one student, Li Yedan, said.

'Following his map was like travelling around the world. It showed us how interesting how geography can be.'

Only after a minute of sketching he is already well on his way to completing the task   

After three minutes' work he just has to add the final touches

Another student, Liu Junhao, agreed and thought that Wang’s unique style of teaching helped to make classes more interesting.

'He shows us the world and helps us to understand more about our planet,' Liu said.

Wang explained that one of his former teachers always drew maps in class, which gave him the inspiration to do the same for his students.

It takes him four minutes to draw a map of the world in his classroom

“I find drawing maps to be a more direct and engaging way to interest students in geography. It grabs their attention and makes them more interested in the subject. This makes them enjoy the class even more,” he said.

But Wang still thinks he can do better. In his office he has a globe of the world on his table, and he spends time daily studying the globe and practising his drawing to make them even more accurate.

By continual study Wang believes he can draw his maps even more precisely

'I still practice a lot and compare my work to original maps so I can be more precise,' he said.

Students said Wang was able to weave together knowledge to broaden their perspective. When drawing his maps Wang also often talks about world news and the goings on in each country he is drawing.

As a result of his impressive map drawing skills Wang is attracting attention outside the classroom

It's a novel approach that brings his students on a trip around the world without ever leaving their classroom.
