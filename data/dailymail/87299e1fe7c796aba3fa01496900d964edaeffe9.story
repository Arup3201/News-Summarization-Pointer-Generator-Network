It's the horrifying moment this cyclist was just an 'elbow away' from being collected by an impatient SUV driver turning into a car park.Â 

The 30-year-old cyclist named Blake was riding on a Perth road on Saturday when the frightening incident unfolded.

He was on a stretch of road just 200 metres long when the driver of the SUV swerved around and cut in front of his bike.

'If my elbows had have been out I would have been collected,' Blake told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was riding a metre away from the gutter and it's the only part of my ride where I have to go on the road - the rest of the time I'm on a bike path.

'It's disappointing I have to put up with that when I'm allowed to be on the road.'

Footage recorded on Blake's helmet camera showed another 4WD passing him with plenty of room, before the black SUV with 'my family' stickers plastered on the back cut in front.

Blake said he was forced to swerve after the vehicle slammed on his brakes to turn into a car park.

The driver could be heard yelling out expletives as Blake passed him again.

The driver had cut in front so he could turn right into a car park just a few metres up the road - something Blake says he could have waited patiently for

'If the driver had waited four more seconds, he could have turned properly,' he said.

'It's intimidation with a vehicle. It's somebody's life. Would you pass someone that closely if you knew them?'

Blake has filed a complaint with police and handed over the helmet camera footage.
