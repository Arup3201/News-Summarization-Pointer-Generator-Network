Louis van Gaal has Manchester United doing something that none of the other top teams are - playing long balls.

Time and time again his central defenders will bypass the midfield and aim straight for the front and I applaud it.

Van Gaal is playing to his strengths. His best outfield players are Angel di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata and he needs to get them on the ball as much as possible. There is no real need to pass through the compartments, especially when Michael Carrick is the only conventional midfielder in his team.

Manchester United have played the second-highest number of long balls in the Premier League this season

Being direct gets his danger men on the ball in danger areas. It happened time after time against Tottenham Hotspur so it is no surprise that only Burnley have played more long balls this season.

What is interesting is that United are not even that worried about whether Van Persie or Falcao win the initial header from the ball upfield - they just make sure that Rooney or Mata are there to pick up the knockdown, ready to cause problems in the final third. They can suffocate you with so much quality.

It suits United’s defenders too. Paddy McNair, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans are happier playing long balls as they are not confident enough to pick out more intricate passes.

There is a lot to be said for a more direct approach at times. People talk about long balls and short balls but football is about playing the right ball. Too often the obsession with playing the ball through each compartment of the team again and again slows teams down.

Aston Villa and Everton are two of the most guilty. Christian Benteke is one of the best strikers in the Barclays Premier League but he often leaves the pitch looking like he’s in a strop. You can’t blame him because he’s more or less ignored for 90 minutes as his team-mates fail to get the ball to him early. I’ve lost count of the number of times Tom Cleverley has a forward, diagonal pass available but turns round and plays it square because that is what he has been told to do.

Romelu Lukaku is being similarly starved at Everton - he only had four touches in the opposition box at home to Stoke City last week.

Villa and Everton need to vary their approach like they did last season, when both sides were in the top three in terms of the most direct passes played.

The aim of the game is to climb a ladder through the team - it doesn’t matter how you get to the top of it as long as you do.

And as a defender you are far happier when teams are passing the ball round and round in front of you as it is not testing you. Look how Southampton’s direct approach with Sadio Mane caused John Terry problems on Sunday. Burnley’s attacking pair Ashley Barnes and Danny Ings are doing really well but that is because Burnley get the ball forward to them a lot so they have opportunities to affect the match.

Even under Arsene Wenger I played the occasional long ball to mix things up, the most notable being the pass that set up Marc Overmars for the winning goal at Old Trafford in 1998. If you build up too slowly, the opposition has time to get 11 men behind the ball.

I watched the Real Madrid youth team recently and they adopted a similar approach to Van Gaal. Their centre halves played the ball up to the front men quickly and they weren’t obsessed with passing through the compartments for the sake of it.

When you watch youth football in England, defenders seem to be programmed to play the same passes all the time, sideways or slightly forward in a horseshoe shape. It became the trend after all of Barcelona’s success but we need to train the next generation to feel comfortable playing both ways.

Marc Overmars scored at Old Trafford for Arsenal in 1998 after a long through-ball from Martin Keown

It’s the same with defending: we have a generation of centre backs who are only used to facing one striker. So when United or other teams use two up front, defenders look confused.

Van Gaal has clearly spotted this and it is reaping dividends - now it’s time for others to follow suit.
