This is the gut-wrenching moment a cyclist crashes head on into a car that pulls out in front of him on a busy London street.

The dramatic footage was caught on the cyclist's head camera as he rode down the cycle path in Clapham Road.

And in a cruel twist, the collision involves a new bike the cyclist was testing ahead of an organised riding trip to Malaysia.

When the car suddenly pulls out in front of the helpless cyclist, he is unable to avoid it and crashes into the side doors.

The unnamed rider is thrown from the bicycle and lands on the pavement crying out in distress.

The footage has been posted on YouTube by the cyclist, known by his username Leluxe.cc and has been viewed more than 150,000 times.

In the video description the cyclist wrote that he was lucky to be alive.

The victim also revealed that he was road testing a new bike before a trip to Malaysia to take part in the Kuantan 160, which is a 160km ride around the East Coast.

Last year more than 1,900 cyclists participated in the event along with 400 international riders.
