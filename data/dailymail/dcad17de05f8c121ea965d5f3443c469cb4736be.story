If your name is Susan Smith and you have a husband named David, a semi-detached house and drive a Ford Ka the chances are you are not alone.

You are in fact the UK’s Mr and Mrs Average and like a significant proportion of the country, the pair of you share a mortgage on your 1970s three bedroom home and look forward to holidays in the US.

New data from insurers Aviva have pin-pointed the most typical British households and even narrowed it down by generation.

So if you are aged between 45 and 54 you’re most likely to be called either Gary or Deborah.

You will probably live in a detached or semi-detached house and drive a Citroen Picasso and go on holidays in Jamaica.

Your children, if they are aged 18-25, will most likely be called Daniel, Emma, Matthew or Rachel and  drive Peugeots, live in flats and go on mini breaks to Amsterdam or Ibiza.

And at the other end of the scale your parents are most likely to be called Ronald and Joan and they live in a bungalow and cruise around in a Honda Jazz.

The UK’s largest insurer studied a 
million of their customers in an effort to work out the most common 
names, cars, homes and holidays based on age certain brackets.

What they found appears to be proof of some astonishing generational trends.

For example half of all people called Gary, Deborah, Nigel or Alison are aged 45-54 and three quarters of people called Ronald, Joan, Joyce and Jean are over 65.

But it’s not just names that define the generations, changing priorities and social trends appear to impact many people the same way, leading them to make very similar life choices.

The rise in popularity of cruises among older generations means it is by far the most popular holiday choice for those with grown-up children, with some 58 per cent of visitors to the Norwegian fjords over the age of 55.

The data also reflects a pattern of life starting with young adults preferring cheaper flats, sporty cars and party holidays, to those in their 30s prioritising larger more comfortable houses and family beach holidays, and finally pensioners downsizing their properties and enjoying holidays closer to home.

Those under 34 are most likely to live in either a flat or a maisonette, with a third of all basement flats being occupied by someone between the age of 25 and 34.

As young people settle down and earn better salaries they become more likely to drive a faster car and take more exotic holidays – four in 10 Brits who visit Japan are 25-34 – before becoming parents changes the emphasis to more space at home and sensible utility vehicles.

But there were also some unifying factors across the generations. Most people said the age when they are most content was 32 and that changed very little regardless of the age of the individual at the time.

Heather Smith, marketing director at Aviva said: ‘The past decades have been a time of great change and it’s fascinating to see these differences between the generations.

‘As trends have come and gone, we have whole age groups identifiable by their name, where they live, what they drive and where they holiday.

‘It shows a remarkable progression through life as we change from wanting lively holidays and nippy city cars to going on child-friendly beach breaks and driving family run-a-rounds, to preferring the quiet life with a cruise and a hatchback.'

Aviva provides insurance, savings and investment products to 14 million Brits and carried out their research in June 2013.
