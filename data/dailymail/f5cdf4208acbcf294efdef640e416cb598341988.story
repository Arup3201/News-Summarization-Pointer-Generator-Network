A drunk-driver responsible for the deaths of three people in China faces the death penalty after being captured following a five-mile long high-speed police chase.

The driver, Lee Dong, 28, lost control of his car and killed a pedestrian before leaving the scene at high speed.

A nearby patrol car gave chase and the driver pulled alongside Dong, in a bid to get him to pull over.

Despite the carnage, Dong managed to escape the scene at high speed, with several other police cars in pursuit.

The pursuers followed Dong to a roadblock five miles away where he was eventually forced to stop.

When police dragged Dong from the car he was found to be very drunk.

A police spokesman said: ‘A decade ago we never had crimes like this.  Few people could afford cars and the ones they could afford would never reach the speeds of the models they drive now.  It is a phenomenon triggered by China's new wealth.’

It is understood that Dong could possibly face the death penalty due to the deaths.
