Jose Mourinho gave his humiliated Chelsea stars the silent treatment following their shock FA Cup loss to Bradford.

The Blues were left shell-shocked after relinquishing a 2-0 lead to concede four against the League One side.

Mourinho headed into the Bradford dressing room to congratulate Phil Parkinson's side following their historic victory.

4 - Bradford became the fourth opponents to score four goals against a team coached by Mourinho after Barcelona (2010, 0-5), Borussia Dortmund (2013, 1-4) and Tottenham (2015, 3-5). The Bantams are the first team ever to do it away from home.

2008 - The last time Chelsea lost to a lower league team in the FA Cup was against Barnsley in 2008.

Jon Stead has scored four goals and assisted four in his last five FA Cup games.

1 - This is the first time Chelsea have conceded more than two goals at home this season in all competitions.

£7,500 - Striker James Hanson is the only Bradford player to command a fee, £7,500. In contrast, Chelsea’s starting line-up cost a whopping £101million.

10 - Mourinho’s side have conceded 10 goals in 2015 — only four teams in the Premier League, Championship, League One and League Two have let in more in the same period.

Former Chelsea winger Filipe Morais  has scored three goals and provided two assists in his last five FA Cup games for Bradford.

1958 - Chelsea conceded four goals to a third-tier team for the first time since 1958, when they lost 4-1 to Darlington — the goals coming from Tommy Moran (two), Ron Harbertson and Dave Carr.

But his mood towards his own players was far less complimentary.

'What did I say to the players? Nothing. Not a word,' said Mourinho. 'It wasn't a moment to speak to them.'

Instead, Mourinho used Sunday's scheduled warm down training session at the club's Cobham HQ to begin the inquest into the defeat.

The Chelsea manager was at his desk by 8am on Sunday ahead of his players' arrival.

His first priority was to ensure there is not a lingering hangover following Saturday's embarrassing loss with tomorrow's Capital One Cup semi-final second leg clash against Liverpool looming.

'I don't think they played poorly — the way they arrived to 2-0 looked quite comfortable. The goal they scored after forty something minutes got them into the game and after that there are things difficult to explain.

'Goals we missed, goals we concede. Do I blame myself for this? (I blame myself) the same as the players. I think we should share between us. But if I am the boss, the boss has more responsibilities.

'Maybe the players switched off after going 2-0 up. But at half-time it was 2-1 and then we spoke about the danger of the situation. We spoke about how they play, we repeated at half-time what we spoke in the preparation of the match.

'Maybe you don't believe but we prepared in the same way we prepare for a Premier League match, the same power point presentation, same analysis, the same information, we prepare exactly the same way.

'We respect them — at least I respect them — in the way we prepared for the game but at half-time the players thought 'We are going to score, not them' and when they scored for 2-2, after that the game became crazy.'

Chelsea captain John Terry was left on the bench but Mourinho's insists his side didn't miss his leadership

Without key-defensive trio John Terry, Nemanja Matic and Branislav Ivanovic, who were all rested, the Blues struggled to stem the flow of Bradford's second-half momentum.

But Mourinho insists he still has faith in his squad despite losing.

'Did we miss Terry's leadership? No,' said the Portuguese. 'We played lots of games without John. We played almost every Cup game without John. We played Bolton, Shrewsbury and Watford without John and the team coped well with the situation.

'I trust my squad. It is not because of this disappointment and this bad performance that I am going to change.

'It is easy for you to understand now why I play almost every game with the same players. I don't make many changes.

'I try to keep stability in the team. Maybe now you can understand a bit better why. I don't want to speak too much about it. This is my squad — let's move on.

'This result doesn't alter may plans in the transfer market. I'm happy to go with the squad I have. This is Chelsea always thinking and being proud of thinking of numbers and Financial Fair Play and so on.

'We cannot now go to the market and spend money. I am completely with the club. I share this idea. I don't think we are going to the market, unless someone makes a market with us.'
