An uninterrupted two-hour canal boat journey might not be the sort of thing you’d normally sit down to watch on TV.

But it will feature with a three-hour tour of the National Gallery and half-hour shows on traditional craftsmanship in a new BBC series of programmes shot in real time, designed to relax viewers.

The concept has been inspired by ‘slow TV’ in Norway, which in recent years has included a seven-hour recording of a train journey, a five-day programme on boat travel and 12 hours on knitting.

The three programmes will dispense with editing, voice overs and music. Viewers will be able to tune in to The Canal, a  journey down one of Britain’s historic waterways.

It will feature the sights and sounds of wildlife and the tow path as the boat passes, giving facts about the canal as captions in the landscape.

National Gallery will be a three-hour behind the scenes tour of the gallery with Frederick Wiseman – again, with no voiceover, but taking viewers from board room meetings to exhibition spaces.

Make presents three half-hour programmes showing traditional craftsmanship as skilled workers make items including a steel knife and a wooden chair.

BBC Four channel editor Cassian Harrison said: ‘This surprising selection of programmes is the antithesis to the general direction much of television is going in.

‘Slowing everything right down gives us the time to really observe things as they happen, and this series of programmes celebrates the simple pleasures of life in the slow lane.’ 

The reaction to the announcement of the series - called BBC Four Goes Slow - today on Twitter was mixed. Producer Chuck Thomas joked: 'It's only a matter of time until ITV2 commissions Watching Paint Dry.'

But Olympia Brown, science learning manager at the Royal Institution, said: 'Love that Cassian Harrison is doing slow TV on BBC 4. Including three hours of traditional craftmanship!'

The idea for slow TV began in Norway in 2009 when producers decided to broadcast the whole journey of a long train line that runs from Oslo to Bergen to celebrate its 100th anniversary.

Slow TV shows, which are known as ‘Sakte-TV’ in Norwegian, have also included a 134-hour boat trip from Bergen to Kirkenes, and a 24-hour broadcast of the first day of the salmon fishing season.

Norway has attracted international attention for its series of ‘slow TV' programmes, including a live-broadcast of a seven-hour train journey and the knitting of a jumper.

The concept was born on state broadcaster NRK (Norsk Rikskringkasting - which translates as Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) in 2009 with centenary of the Bergen railway line.

Rather than commission a conventional feature programme on the line, NRK instead decided to put a camera on a train and broadcast the entire seven-hour trip from Oslo to Bergen, interweaving archive footage to liven up the programme.

Remarkably, it was a roaring success, with 1.2million viewers - about a quarter of the population of Norway - tuning in for at least part of the trip.

Since then, the network has broadcast a cruise journey, a fire being slowly built and burned, and more recently, the making of a jumper - starting with the sheep from which the wool came.

Last year, the tax-funded channel began the online broadcast of Piipshow, a live stream of birds and squirrels in a feeder that looks like a coffee shop.

Also last year, British Airways announced it would make the seven-hour train journey video available to passengers on its in-flight entertainment system.
