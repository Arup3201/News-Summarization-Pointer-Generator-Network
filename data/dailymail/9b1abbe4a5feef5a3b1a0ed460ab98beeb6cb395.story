Camp Bastion: Prince Harry was moved to a guarded location following the Taliban attack on the camp, even though it was said he was never in danger

Prince Harry was moved to a guarded location during a recent Taliban attack in Afghanistan.

The 28-year-old is being protected by 'additional security arrangements' as he carries out his second tour of duty in the war-torn country, the Defence Secretary has revealed.

Phillip Hammond had earlier told the Commons that Captain Wales - as Harry is known to the Army - was never in danger although he was present during the assault on Camp Bastion last Friday.

But last night, speaking on BBC 2's Newsnight, Hammond said that the arrangements recognised the prince 'could be a target... specifically as a result of who he is'.

Two US Marines were killed and six 
planes destroyed during the attack on the desert base in Helmand 
province, where the bulk of the UK's 9,500-strong force in Afghanistan 
are deployed.

Taliban sources claimed Bastion was targeted because Prince Harry is serving there as an Apache attack helicopter gunner.

The Prince was about two kilometres 
away with other Apache crew members during the assault on the base, 
which is the same size as Reading.

Speaking last night, Hammond said: 'Clearly there are fall-back plans and I can't go into the detail of them - but once we knew on Friday night that the perimeter at Bastion had been breached he would have been moved to a secure position under effective guard.'

Asked by presenter Jeremy Paxman if that meant Prince Harry was not treated the same as every other soldier, the Defence Secretary said: 'You asked me whether he was at any greater risk.

'And I've told you that in combat he's at the same risk as any other Apache pilot.

'Clearly if we had a VIP in theatre and frankly if I was there or, Jeremy, if you were there in Camp Bastion and there was a breach of the perimeter security, anybody who might, by nature of who they are, be a target, they would be put in a secure location.'

He added: 'He is serving there as an ordinary officer but clearly there are additional security arrangements in place that recognise that he could be a target himself specifically as a result of who he is.'

Mr Hammond's comments came following a bloody spell for Nato forces in the troubled country, which saw two British soldiers killed at the weekend by an attacker dressed as an Afghan policeman and pretending to be injured.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told Newsnight there are 'additional security arrangements' in place that 'recognise that he (Prince Harry) could be a target himself specifically as a result of who he is'

Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province, on Saturday, in what appears to be the latest in a string of 'green-on-blue' incidents.

The soldiers, from 3rd Battalion, The
Yorkshire Regiment, were killed at a checkpoint when a man dressed as a
local Afghan policeman pretended to be injured so they would help him.

Nato says it is restricting operations
with Afghan troops following the string of deadly attacks on its 
personnel by rogue Afghan security forces.

Only large operations will now be conducted jointly, with joint patrols evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Deadly: The Taliban claimed responsibility on Saturday for the attack on the British base

The news comes after the deaths of the two soldiers prompted a furious reaction from MPs and relatives yesterday – who demanded that troops were brought home from an ‘unwinnable war’.

Yesterday Sergeant Thursby’s stepfather Brain Whitaker, 58, said UK troops were fighting a ‘losing battle’.

Mr
Whitaker, who lives with Gareth’s mother, Caroline, 49, in Padiham, 
Lancashire, added: ‘We just feel numb at the moment but it is absolutely
ridiculous that our troops are still out there.

‘Gareth’s
death just shows that these people don’t want us there and as soon as 
we leave the Taliban will be back in power. This war is totally and 
utterly pointless.’

Private
Wroe’s family said he was ‘buzzing’ to deploy to Afghanistan. His 
comrades in 3 Yorks had arrived there in the spring but he had to remain
in the UK until he turned 18.

His mother Claire, 39, a care home deputy manager, said: ‘He couldn’t wait to go. He wanted to go and join all his mates, he was so excited.’

His father, Mick, 48 – who served 22 years in the Duke of Wellington’s Regiment, which became 3 Yorks – said: ‘He was a proper little soldier. He just wanted to be in the Army. It’s all he ever wanted to do.’

On Friday, Lance Corporal Duane Groom, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, died after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb.

The weekend's news brought the total number of members of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 430.

Answering an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Hammond insisted the strategy of 'mentoring and training' Afghan army and police was vital to the war effort, adding: 'We cannot and we will not allow the process to be derailed.'

Afghan deputy foreign minister Jawed 
Ludin said he understood Nato's efforts to protect its forces but 
insisted the move did not represent a 'break in the partnership' to 
train Afghan forces to take over in 2014.

'This insider attack phenomenon is a matter of deep concern for all of us,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'This is a challenge that has come up in what is really a very essential mission and that is to get the Afghan forces up to speed.

'We are fully aware and conscious of this and how important it is and that it could affect our joint effort and we are trying our best.

'For Nato to take measures to reduce the risk of these attacks being repeated is a very natural thing. We totally understand it.

'But this should not be overstated because these are just some of the measures to reduce risk; they do not in any way represent a break in the partnership that exists on a day-to-day basis and this will continue.'

He added: 'Joint operations are crucial but they could be conducted in a way that reduces the risk of Nato soldiers suffering these attacks.'
