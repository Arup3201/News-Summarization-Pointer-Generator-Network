Toronto FC striker Jermain Defoe has not had his faith shattered by his World Cup snub earlier this year and showed it by putting his latest tattoo on Instagram on Tuesday.

The 32-year-old former Tottenham and West Ham star has had 'Psalm 91' inked on to his hand to show his support to Christianity.

Psalm 91, featured in the Bible, explains how the Lord will guard and protect his followers.

Toronto FC forward Defoe has scored 11 goals in 19 games for the MLS outfit so far this season

'Because he loves me,' says the Lord, 'I will rescue him;

I will protect him, for he acknowledges my name.

He will call on me, and I will answer him;

I will be with him in trouble,

I will deliver him and honour him.

With long life I will satisfy him

and show him my salvation.'

'For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways; 12 they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.'

Whether that refers to Defoe's 797,000 followers on Twitter remains to be seen. 

Defoe has scored 11 goals in 19 games in the MLS since joining Toronto at the end of February.

The Canadian club's top scorer will be hoping to add to his goals tally when his side take on New England in their final match of the season on Saturday.

We do not know whether he is praying for a return to the Premier League after that...
