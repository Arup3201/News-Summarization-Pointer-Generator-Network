Mourning: Alexandra Kogut's devastated family released this photo of the college freshman on Monday

Hours before an 18-year-old college student was brutally beaten to death in her dorm room by her high school sweetheart, she wrote a final, chilling final tweet: 'Should have known.'

Alexandra Kogut had been carrying on a long distance relationship with Clayton S Whittemore, 21, after she went to school at the College at Brockport near Rochester, New York, 150 miles away from their hometown of New Hartford.

Police say Whittemore admitted to battering his girlfriend, whom he had been dating for about a year, after he was arrested at a rest stop between Brockport and New Hartford.

The Utica Observer-Dispatch reports 
exchanged dozens of messages with each other over Twitter. Most were 
playful and affectionate.

'So excited for @Whittemore21 to come
to Brockport Saturday and bring me half moons,' she tweeted to her 
boyfriend in early September, according to the newspaper.

'Not if I eat them all first yummm,' Whittemore responded.

'You better not eat my half moons or tomato pie!!!!' was her retort. 'Half moon' is another name for black and white cookies.

Kogut and Whittemore lived in New 
Hartford, in central New York about two and a half hours east of 
Brockport, and attended the same high school.

Kogut's childhood friend Mary Kate 
Heaton said the two had appeared 'perfectly content' in the 
relationship, which began last year.

'I know she loved him a lot,' Ms Heaton said on Monday.

Heaton and Kogut, along with their 
mothers, had taken a trip to New York City just before heading off to 
college, Heaton said. Kogut gave no hint of trouble as the group shopped
and saw 'Phantom of the Opera' on Broadway in New York City, she said.

'She was texting him throughout the whole trip,' Heaton said.

Friends of Kogut rallied fellow students on Monday to wear purple to raise domestic violence awareness.

Kogut's family released a photo of her along with a statement asking for privacy.

'Alexandra Kogut was a bright, 
beautiful young woman who was thrilled to be beginning her college 
education,' the family said. 'Her lovely and sweet demeanor was truly 
infectious and she will forever be missed.'

Kogut's body was found early Saturday
in her dorm at the State University of New York campus after her mother
called them concerned because she couldn't reach her, Monroe County 
sheriff's spokesman John Helfer said.

Whittemore, a student at Utica 
College near his hometown, was arrested at a Thruway rest stop near 
Syracuse, 100 miles east, about an hour later. He told state troopers he
intentionally killed Kogut, according to a criminal complaint. No 
motive was given.

On the run: Though he apparently confessed to police when they found him, that happened at a highway rest stop more than 100 miles away from the dorm room where the young woman's body was found

School shock: Whittemore is not enrolled at SUNY Brockport, but his girlfriend was a student at the school

The cause of death was ruled blunt 
force trauma, Helfer said, but he declined to say whether a weapon was 
used. Her injuries were extensive and mostly focused on her upper body, 
the campus police chief said.

Whittemore pleaded not guilty over 
the weekend to a murder charge and is being held without bail in Monroe 
County Jail. Telephone messages left at his family's New Hartford home 
and at his public defender's office weren't immediately returned Monday.

Whittemore lives in his hometown of New Hartford and was a promising hockey star during high school. He was featured as an 'Athlete of the Week' by WKTV Utica in 2010.

He is being held under the custody of the Monroe County Sheriff and has yet to be issued bail.

'It's tragic when anyone loses their life,' campus police chief Robert Kehoe told ABC affiliate WHAM.

'When a young lady who's a college student and apparently in a safe environment, is brutally murdered as this young lady was, it's certainly a tragedy for her family and friends and the entire Brockport college community.'
