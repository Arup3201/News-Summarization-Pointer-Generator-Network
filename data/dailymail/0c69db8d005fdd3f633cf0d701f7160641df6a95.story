Most parents take pleasure in choosing toys and gifts for their children.

But for one mother, even stepping foot in a toy store is a struggle - because she is terrified of The Muppets. 

Lindsay Broom has suffered from a rare form of automatonophobia - a phobia of puppets - since she was five years old.

The 37-year-old solicitor - who is mother to three-year-old daughter Liesl and newborn Martha, two months - often breaks down when reminded of Jim Henson's universally-loved 
characters.

She is also petrified of the colourful characters in children's television series Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock.

Mrs Broom, who lives with husband Alex, 38, said: 'My daughter is old enough to start choosing her own toys now.

'She can have whatever she wants, of 
course. But I'm terrified she'll choose a Kermit the Frog doll, because I
know I won't be able to live with it.

'All it takes is for Alex to hum the theme song of The Muppets and I'm a wreck.

'When
I see them, I automatically imagine the puppets' facial features 
twisting and distorting, and I have to get away from them.'

Automatonophobia is a fear of puppets, ventriloquist dummies, waxworks and animatronic models.

It is considered an irrational fear because the objects of terror pose no threat to personal safety.

In extreme cases, sufferers can experience a racing heart, breathing difficulties, nausea, diarrhea, shaking, sleeping problems and light sensitivity.

Pupaphobia is a strain of automatonophobia that is specially related to the fear of puppets.

Mrs Broom, from Swansea, first realised her fear during a holiday in Newquay nearly 20 years ago. 

'The shows were never on in our house while I was growing up, so I didn't have much exposure to them,' she said.

'I only realised how badly I was affected when I was on holiday with some friends in Newquay when I was 18. 

'I broke down when I spotted a furry Muppet toy in a tourist shop. I was shaking - I just completely freaked out. 

'My friends thought it was hilarious, but I was terrified.'

She traces the root of her phobia to a 'terrifying' experience when she was five years old. 

'I'd
gone with my mum to pick up a second-hand rabbit hutch we'd bought from
a local family', she said.

'Mum went outside with the seller to lift 
the hutch into our car, and I was left inside the house, in a dark room,
with an elderly lady.

'The elderly woman didn't say a word, but she was obviously unwell. She sat there groaning and wheezing as an episode of The Muppets was playing on the TV. 

'It was the strangest and most terrifying experience of my entire life. When mum came back to collect me from the room, I burst into tears. I remember it like it was yesterday.'

Arachibutyrophobia - the fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of the mouth

Clinophobia - fear of going to bed

Triskaidekaphobia -the fear of the number 13

Nomophobia - the fear of being out of mobile phone contact

Automatonophobia is considered an irrational fear because the objects of terror - such as puppets, ventriloquist dummies, waxworks and animatronic models - pose no threat to personal safety.

In extreme cases, sufferers can experience a racing heart, breathing difficulties, nausea, diarrhea, shaking, sleeping problems and light sensitivity.

In Mrs Broom's case, the phobia is limited strictly to characters from three popular television shows. 

She said: 'I'm fine with most puppets. It's only The Muppets, Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock I can't stand.

'A few years ago I visited a theme park in Florida with my nephew. He was desperate to go on a Muppets-themed ride, but I had to run out of the queue.'

While there is no known cure for automatonophobia, possible treatments include hypnosis, psychoanalysis therapy and even medication. 

Mrs Broom said: 'I haven't sought medical advice - the phobia is so specialised that I can't imagine anyone will be able to help me.'

Other unusual phobias known to medical science include nomophobia, the fear of being out of mobile phone contact; triskaidekaphobia, the fear of the number 13, and arachibutyrophobia, the fear of peanut butter sticking to the roof of the mouth.

Jim Henson was an American puppeteer, screenwriter and film producer.

He is best known for creating The Muppets, bringing to life universally-loved stars such as Kermit the Frog and  Miss Piggy.

He also created Sesame Street characters, including Cookie Monster and Big Bird, and children's puppet series Fraggle Rock.

Henson, who died in May 1990, was also an Emmy Award-winning television producer and founder of The Jim Henson Company.

He cited ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and puppeteer Burr Tillstrom among his early influences, and always felt that puppetry should be for all ages - not just children..

During his final years, he co-created with Michael Jacobs the television show Dinosaurs.

Henson's wife and fellow puppeteer Jane, who was instrumental in bringing The Muppets to life, died in April after a long battle with cancer.

In August,That Puppet Game Show, produced by the Jim Henson Company, debuted on BBC One.

However, the puppet-run show - which saw two celebrities compete to win £10,000 for charity - was axed last month due to low viewing figures.
