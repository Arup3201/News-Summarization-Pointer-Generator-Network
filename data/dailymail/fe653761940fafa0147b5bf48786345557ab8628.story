Police were stunned when they pulled over an erratic motorist to find he was steering his damaged car - with a pair of workshop PLIERS.

The 38-year-old was driving with two blown-out tyres when he was stopped by cops during rush hour on Monday morning.

Amazingly, his car did not have a steering wheel and he was attempting to control the vehicle using a vice grip.

Pliers were clamped around the steering column and he was using them to steer the vehicle, turning the shaft with the pliers

Pliers were clamped around the steering column and he was using them to steer the vehicle, turning the shaft with the pliers.

The driver was arrested and charged with a long list of offences including driving while disqualified and under the influence of methyl amphetamine and cannabis.

He was also charged with driving without due care, driving in a dangerous manner, driving while unregistered, uninsured and contrary to defect and breaching his bail conditions.

Police in Adelaide, Southern Australia, believe he was involved in an earlier hit-and-run incident and he was further charged with failing to stop at the scene of a crash.

A statement from South Australia Police said: 'While this is an extreme example, police wish to remind all motorists they have a responsibility to drive with due care at all times.

'Operation Distraction, a state-wide focus on driver behaviour, in particular the use of mobile phones while driving and failing to wear seatbelts, continues to run throughout the month of July and more than 1,700 offences have been detected.'

The man appeared in court today and was remanded in custody.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
