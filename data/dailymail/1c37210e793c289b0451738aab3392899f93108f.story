In the wake of a traumatic murder, many grieving relatives look to old photos and mementos for comfort.

When tragedy struck her family, photographer Noelle Swan Gilbert chose to pick up the camera instead and unknowingly began forming a collection of photos that documented what life looked like after a murder.

Noelle's sister Laura Swan was stabbed to death by her husband in the family kitchen, leaving their two young sons without a mother and with a father behind bars.

'I was obviously in a state of grief and shock when it happened and I just stopped doing everything in my life,' Ms Gilbert told MailOnline about the 2007 murder.

Facing the uncertain: For the year after their father killed their mother, Tommy (left) and Mike (right) were kept in the dark about exactly what happened for fear that their father would take them away from the custody of their maternal grandparents

Changes: When Laura Swan was killed in 2007, her mother (pictured right) took custody of her two grandchildren and moved them from their home in Colorado to her house in Seattle, Washington

Heartbreaking: The boys initially were told that there father was staying behind in Colorado to help police find who killed their mother. They didn't know that he was the one who stabbed her to death

Watchful eye: It was only after their father's sentencing, when he accepted a 25-year plea deal, that they learned what happened and their grandparents were awarded custody

A professional fine arts photographer, Ms Gilbert could not even bring herself to pick up a camera until three months after Laura's death.

By that time, Laura's two sons- Tommy, 2, and Mikey, 4- had been taken out of temporary foster care and been temporarily placed in the guardianship of their maternal grandparents.

In her memory: Noelle Swan Gilbert, the boys' aunt, told MailOnline that they love hearing stories about their 'beautiful' mother Laura Swan (pictured)

It was only when the family gathered for Thanksgiving at her mother's Seattle home that she thought to bring her camera, as her mother wanted a photo of the seven grandkids together for her Christmas card.

'It was really the first time I had had a camera in my hands,' Ms Gilbert told MailOnline. 

'I was so sad and instead of looking at them directly, I just started taking pictures of them,' she said of the two orphaned boys.

At first glance, the pictures appear to be just simple depictions of the normal lives of everyday children.

It is only with the knowledge of what the boys went through that a new element of sadness is cast over each image.

Ms Swan Gilbert took photos of the boys starting from three months after the murder and stretching until just recently.

'The last time I saw them, it didn't feel right to shoot them so I haven’t actually shot them in two years because I do value our privacy and our relationship too much,' Ms Gilbert said.

Their father, Alfred Michael 'Mike' Strauss, accepted a plea deal of 25 years for second degree murder.

Powering through the pain: Ms Gilbert, a professional fine arts photographer, found the first Thanksgiving after her sister's murder the most difficult and she found it comforting to look at her nephews through a camera lens

Stopping the bad guys: The boys sometimes receive cards from their father behind bars

Moving on: Tommy, the younger of the two, reminds Ms Gilbert of his slain mother with his mischievous sense of humor

Growing up: The boys are both extremely athletic and have adapted quickly to their new home in Seattle

Keeping busy: Tommy and Mike, seen here with other relatives, now live with their aunt who also has a son their age and Ms Gilbert says that all three boys are being raised like brothers

In court, he said that he stabbed his wife in the midst of an argument, but gave little other explanation as the case never went to trial.

He legally had custody of the couple's two sons for months immediately after the murder and his wife's mother and father, the boys' grandparents, was given temporary custody while he was behind bars up until he was finally sentenced.

'We fought a really long battle to keep them and my parents were visited all the time by social services,' Ms Gilbert said of the period before her grandparents were granted full custody.

During that waiting period, the relatives kept mum on what happened between the boys' parents because they feared that, since Strauss still had legal authority over the boys, he may revoke their guardianship of them.

'It feels like it was yesterday and then it feels like it was ten years ago,' Ms Gilbert says of her sister's murder

Moving fast: Ms Gilbert said that as time went on, she began taking fewer and fewer photos of her nephews during their visits

Rights of passage: Mike, seen here ahead of his Holy Communion, enjoys sports just like his younger brother but Ms Gilbert says that he can be slightly more quiet at times

'They knew that their mother was dead and they thought their father was helping them find the person who killed her,' Ms Gilbert said of what they told Tommy and Mikey, who now prefers to go by Mike.

'They were confused! We felt like such a******s!' Ms Gilbert said of the pressure of keeping the truth of their mother's death under wraps for so long due to the custody controversy.

Now, the boys lives have adapted to life far removed from the 2007 murder in their old house in Colorado.

They originally were taken in by their grandparents in Seattle, Washington. Their aunt Megan and her son- who is about the same age as Tommy- moved into the grandparents home for a time and now Megan has moved out and takes care of all three of the boys, raising them like brothers.

Small moments: The boys have adapted to their new life but their aunt caught several of their reflective moments on camera (Tommy seen here with one of his aunts)

'They're both extremely athletic and they are really the kind and smart and really great kids,' Ms Gilbert said of Tommy and Mike who are now 9 and 11 years old respectively.

'Mike is more quiet and really smart. He's like a superstar basketball player. Tommy's hilariously funny and reminds me a lot of my sister. He's kind of mischievous.

'When I look at him and he says something I immediately think of my sister. He's so freaking cute.'

The boys are aware of the photo project that their aunt has put together through the years, but they are not overly interested in looking through those trying times.

'They love talking about their Mom because they love hearing stories about her but they're 9 and 11- they want to talk about the Broncos and the Seahawks. They're doing their sports stuff,' Ms Gilbert told MailOnline.
