A new father-of-two spent an hour and ten minutes officially dead before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart.

David Binks, 28, was brought back to life 70 minutes after a cardiac arrest at his home in Houghton-le-Spring, Sunderland

In a desperate bid to revive him, his quick-thinking partner Lynette Crozier immediately began CPR, which medics say saved his life.

Paramedics and then hospital staff continued the resuscitation and shocked him 16 times before his heartbeat returned.

Medical Marvel: David Brinks came back to life after being clinically dead for 70 minutes. Mr Brinks' family including partner Lynette and daughter Ella (pictured) were told to expect the worst

Despite his family being told to expect brain damage, David has astounded doctors, and is now back at home recovering.

The dad-of-two has since been told that his case was similar to that of footballer Fabrice Muamba, who collapsed during the Spurs-Bolton match last year.

Mum-of-one Lynette, 22, a former care worker, said: 'David was asleep next to me but I woke up and he was gasping for breath and wasn’t responding.

'I just started shaking him. I knew he had stopped breathing and his heart wasn’t beating and I just called for an ambulance.

'I started doing CPR and chest compressions until the ambulance got there. It was only for about three minutes but it felt like a lifetime.

'Our little girl was shouting for her daddy. I just thought that was it. I thought we’d lost him.

Back on his feet: Mr Binks holds hands with his partner Lynette who said she thought she he had died

'It wasn’t until he got to the hospital that we got him back.'

Following the attack in March, David spent five days on a ventilator in the intensive care unit at Sunderland Royal Hospital before spending a further 11 days on a ward and two days at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle.

His family, including his two little girls Georgia, seven, and Ella, one, were told to brace themselves for the worst as it was extremely likely David would be left brain damaged.

But the former groundsman amazed medics with his recovery.

Lynette said: 'They said that if David was to wake up he would suffer brain damage but they didn’t know what the extent would be because he was out for long.

'I just couldn’t believe it when he woke up. He’s been so lucky.'

Despite undergoing a series of tests it is not known what caused his heart to stop.

David said: 'I just went to bed on the Saturday night and I can’t remember anything after that until I woke up in hospital.

'I didn’t believe everyone when they told me I’d had a heart attack. I just couldn’t believe it. I’ve been so lucky.

'When they carried out tests at the Freeman they couldn’t find anything wrong with me.'

David’s mother Beverley, a florist, has praised the North East Ambulance service.

She said: 'I can’t thank the three paramedics and Lynette enough – they saved my David and I owe everything to them.

Mr Binks spent five days on a ventilator following the attack in March. He was kept in intensive care and treated in hospital for two weeks. His family have praised his medical team for their miracle work

Mr Binks said he was delighted to be reuinted with his one-year-old daughter Ella

'The doctors have told me he was technically dead for one hour and ten minutes.

'I thank God his partner Lynette was there with him when it happened.

'"If she wasn’t he probably would not have been with us now.'

Paramedics Vicky Adamson, Gail Savage and Karen Millican were called to the scene.

Vicky said: 'I don’t think any of us expected to be told that three days later David would be out of his hospital bed. Shocked is an understatement. It’s results like this that make our jobs so rewarding.'

Head of the cardiac department, at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital Dr Ian Purcell  said starting CPR quickly is the key to survival. The cardiologist believes Lynette saved David’s life.

He said: 'Had she not started CPR when she did he would probably have not been here today.'

'The partner, the paramedics and the hospital staff, involved here deserve a lot of credit.'

Previously doctors believed after 20 minutes of resuscitation the chances of survival were very low but in the last year they have received information that suggests the survival rate increases after the 20-minute mark.

Dr Purcell added: 'It does help that this man was young, fit and healthy. Other groups of people who do well in these situations are children. A lot of young children can survive this.'
