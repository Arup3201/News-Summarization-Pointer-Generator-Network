Tests: David Nutt wants to investigate whether magic mushrooms work in treating depression

Campaigners have criticised a decision
to award £550,000 of public funds to a sacked government drugs tsar so 
he can investigate whether magic mushrooms work in treating depression.

Professor David Nutt was forced out of
his role as the Government’s chief drug adviser in 2009 for saying 
ecstasy was less dangerous than horseriding.

He now wants to study whether the 
hallucinogenic ingredient in magic mushrooms, psilocybin, can be used to
treat severe depression.

His team has been given a grant by the Medical
Research Council for a pioneering trial on 60 sufferers who have failed
to respond to two previous treatments.

But he said he cannot start because 
the Home Office must first grant a licence for companies to supply his 
team with the compound.

Critics say Professor Nutt’s track record makes him an inappropriate choice to carry out the research.

Previously, he opposed the decision to
reclassify cannabis from Class C to Class B in 2009, and has argued 
alcohol was ‘considerably more dangerous’ than the drug.

Last year, he 
led a controversial live trial of pure ecstasy on Channel 4.

Mary Brett, of Europe Against Drugs, 
said of the latest project: ‘Why are the MRC giving money to a man who 
had got it completely wrong over cannabis? Professor Nutt’s patchy 
record raises questions. He seems obsessed with recreational drugs.’

Magic mushrooms, with heroin and cocaine, are Class A drugs and are believed to exacerbate mental health problems in some users.

Previously Professor Nutt’s team at 
Imperial College London found psilocybin reduced activity in a part of 
the brain known to be over-active in depression.

But that study was on 
healthy volunteers subject to less stringent regulations.

Only four hospitals in Britain have a 
licence to hold psilocybin, and Professor Nutt said the authorities 
refused to tell him where.

He said: ‘The rules are absurd.’
