A mother in northeastern Oklahoma shot and killed her two grown sons while they slept, then killed herself, law enforcement officials said on Sunday.

Rebecca Smith, 48, also known as Rebecca Brown, fatally shot her sons Levi Brown, 25, and father-of-two Garrett Brown, 24, on Saturday morning while they slept in a Webbers Falls home they shared with her, according to the Muskogee County Sheriff's Department.

The woman left a suicide note, called her brother to tell him she was going to take her own life and then killed herself, the sheriff's department said. 

Smith’s brother called 911 after the call and deputies responded, finding all three bodies.

Shooter: Rebecca Smith, 48, also known as Rebecca Brown, fatally shot her sons as they slept at their home in Webbers Fall, 30 miles south of Muskogee, Oklahoma. She then turned the gun on herself 

Victims: Levi Brown, 25, and father-of-two Garrett Brown, 24, were killed in the murder-suicide. Police have said Smith phoned her brother to say she was going to kill herself and left a suicide note 

The Tulsa World reported that law enforcement is investigating what may have led to the killings and said Smith was taking medication.

It was also suggested that she may have had mental-health issues. 

Detectives aren’t aware of anyone else living inside the home, Mullen said, and no one else was thought to have been present during the shootings.

The father of the slain men, Leroy Brown of Coweta, and his wife, Pam, waited in the driveway outside of the property waiting for updates in the case.

He told the Muskogee Phoenix: 'It’s not the call you want to get at 10 o’clock in the morning. They were a couple of good boys.'

Levi Brown, who attended school in Porter, had been in the Army. He returned to Oklahoma after his time in the military was up. 

 On Christmas Eve Brown, who called herself Beckie on Facebook wrote: 'I just wanted to tell all of you my wonderful amazing family members here on facebook how much I appreciate how very kind you all are always to me. I have been through hell for the last month and you have all been so very kind to me! God will reward you, I just know it.'

Motive: Police are still trying to figure out what happened at their home in rural Oklahoma, but revealed that Smith had been taking medication at the time
