A family is panhandling on the streets of Springfield, Oregon -- hoping to get a kidney from a living donor for their dying mother.

Roxanne Loomis, 63, is a single mother of two children and an emergency room nurse at Sacred Heart Medical Center Riverbend in Springfield, Oregon.

Loomis is believed to battled thin basement membrane disease for ten years -- a genetic condition which has caused her kidneys to fail, KMTR reports.

Loomis expressed her hope for a donor match to the station.

'I'd be jumping up and down, I would be so happy,' she said. 'I mean, they would be my friend for life.'

Loomis, pictured, has reportedly been a nurse for 18 years and is putting her 2 children through college as a single mother, according to website A Kidney for Roxanne which is hoping to help find a living donor

Thin basement membrane disease is believe to have also affected two of Loomis' other siblings. Her sister reportedly died from complications linked to kidney failure.

Her brother John Loomis is healing from kidney failure after a co-worker donated a kidney, the network reports. He shared his concern for his sister.

'She is fairly close to having to get on dialysis and of course we're worried about that because it may interfere with her ability to work,' he told KMTR.

Roxanne Loomis' two children are unable to donate a kidney to their mother because of they may have the same condition, the network adds.

Outside of her family, five of her friends have offered to donate a kidney -- but have all been deemed ineligible.

The criteria for a donor, according to a website set up to help Loomis called A Kidney for Roxanne, 'are to be O + or O- blood type, no high blood pressure, no diabetes, and at a reasonable weight.'

Loomis told KMTR that she will pay all medical expenses for a kidney donation. If you are able to assist, call (541) 302-4917.

So far, five of Roxanne Loomis' friends who have volunteered to donate have been deemed ineligible
