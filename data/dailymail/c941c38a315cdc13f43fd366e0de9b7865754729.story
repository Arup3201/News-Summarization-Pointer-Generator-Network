A California sunglasses company has been forced to take down their billboard above Highway 101 that read 'Happy to sit on your face' for its intentional innuendo.

The signage was meant to be a tongue in cheek promotion of SPY Optic's new line of 'Happy' lenses, which purportedly lift one's spirits with their special design.

'We are a happy brand,' SPY Optic Marketing Director Devon Howard said to MailOnline. 'It's what makes us happy-being on people's faces.'

Thousands of San Diego drivers sped past the sign yesterday, the only day it was displayed, and it appears their complaints swayed Clear Channel Outdoors, the owner of the advertising space, to quickly rip it out of sight - but not out of mind.

Hot Topic: Controversy over a cheeky billboard has forced a California sunglasses company to remove their billboard above Highway 101 that read 'Happy to sit on your face'

Uninterested: The company that owns the billboard, however, was not interested in a conversation or a controversy and took down the sign this morning

'Upon receiving feedback from a few local citizens about SPY's new Hwy 101 billboard—that has been widely enjoyed and celebrated by the community—the advertising space's management company has decided to remove it permanently,' a statement from SPY Optic read.

'Despite the billboard’s positive reception, an underwhelming minority made enough noise that the management company decided this afternoon to remove it first thing Thursday morning.'

Clear Channel Outdoors has not yet returned the MailOnline's request for comment.

SPY Optic said they purchased the space for the entire year for an undisclosed amount and periodically replace the signage every few months.

'We intended for it to be fun. ... And we
 intentionally left out the sunglasses on this first ad to create the 
mystique, as that is a part of the buildup of the campaign,' Mr Howard said.

'If you thought this billboard created some controversy, wait till you see the next…'

The new technology behind the Happy Lens blocks harmful UV rays and 99 per cent of glare, but also lets blue light in.

Studies
 suggest that blue light, specifically color wavelengths between 450 and
 500 nanometers, increases serotonin, making the wearer happier.

The blue background of the billboard was meant to illustrate the innovative design of the sunglasses, which are slated for release in February of 2013.

'You know, it seemed fun, seemed like a way to sort of embrace "let's have a good time with this thing,"' said Mr Howard to 10News.

'We didn't expect the response we've gotten.'

He insisted that most people thought the billboard was funny and it wasn't meant to offend anyone.

More than 25 people protested the removal of the sign today, including SPY Optic staff, demanding that the billboard be put back up or left blank in protest.

'I thought that I read it wrong,' 
said salon owner Sarita Mihaly, whose Moonlight Hair Design sits 
directly below the sign. 'I thought that it was a joke.'

She thought the placard was a great conversation starter, and in a hair salon, that's always a good thing.

'Oh my God, that's quite a sexual kind of comment to make in big bold letters like that,' said her customer Kathleen Anderson.

Clear Channel, however, was not interested in a conversation or a controversy and took down the sign this morning. Spy Optic plans to put up a new poster, at no cost, on September 14.
