A woman shed an incredible nine stone after posting pictures of all of her meals on Instagram - and getting people to rate how healthy they are.

Jess Semmens, 22, takes a series of pictures of what she is about to eat, posts them on her page and waits to see what her followers think of her food.

It may sound like a bizarre routine but uploading hundreds of such snaps online has helped Jess lose nine stone and six dress sizes in two years.

Jess Semmens, 22, went from 22st to 13st after she began posting her meals on Instagram for people to rate

 'You could say that I have Instagrammed myself thin' - Jess began to post workout photos. The positive comments were the confidence boost she needed to carry on

After binge-eating and fad diets Jess found motivation to slim by publicly sharing details of her meals, their calorie count and her weight-loss progress.

Inspired by the online feedback she received - mostly from strangers - she shrank from 22st and a dress size 24, to 13st and size 12.

Research unit manager Jess says: 'Like most women, I had tried every diet under the sun but none worked for me.

'I thought I was doomed to be overweight for ever but when I started counting calories on a phone app and sharing pictures of my meals I was amazed at how many comments I received.

'I started documenting the change in my figure as I lost weight and it was a great way to see my progress and keep me on track whenever I felt like reaching for the biscuit tin.

'If I didn't stick to the diet I wasn't just letting myself down, I'd be letting down all my followers too.

The pressure kept me motivated, as did all the lovely comments I got - and now I feel amazing. You could say that I have Instagrammed myself thin.' 

At just seven, a gym accident left Jess struggling to carry on with the sport and she ballooned in size.

Jess, of Exeter, Devon, says: 'I hated not being able to do my gymnastics so comfort-ate and soon started to pile on the pounds.

'I then started getting bullied at school. The other children would say really nasty things to me. My school days became a nightmare. I'd hide myself away in the toilets.'

Ashamed of her growing belly, from the age of ten, Jess began raiding stashes of food from her parents' kitchen and hiding it to later gorge on in secret.

She says: 'I'd grab anything I could get my hands on and would hide it from my mum and dad. When I was feeling sad, I turned to the snacks for some comfort.'

But the cruel playground taunts went on and Jess's weight continued to climb.

Bullied at school, Jess began to hide herself away and gorge on food in secret

At just the age of seven, Jess, from Exeter, Devon, had a gym accident which left her unable to continue with sports. At this point, her weight began to balloon

By the time she sat her GCSEs in 2008, age 15, Jess was 14st and a dress size 16. A year later, in the summer of 2009, Jess was given a confidence boost when she met her now ex-boyfriend.

She says: 'He didn't care about my body and used to compliment me all the time. All my body hang-ups were suddenly washed away and I felt happier.'

But the nights spent cuddled up on the sofa, still eating the comfort food, only served to worsen Jess's weight problem.

Jess says: 'We settled into a really unhealthy routine. I was happy because I was in love but this had such an awful effect on my health.

'We spent every night slumped on the sofa. We'd have a huge bag of crisps each and a whole tub of ice cream to ourselves. Looking back, I'm disgusted by how much we ate.'

Over the course of just two and half years, Jess ballooned to a size 24, putting on another 7st to reach 22st.

Her office job meant she spent most of her day sat at her desk - and she took no exercise.

She says: 'It got to the point where I was getting out of breath just from walking.

When Jess began sharing her meals on Instagram and counting calories, she began to get positive comments, which motivated her even more

'I was even afraid to go out dancing with my friends because I'd get so hot and tired - I would be dripping with sweat before I had even walked into the club.'

In 2011, Jess visited her GP for a check-up and was given a devastating wake-up call - either she turned around her lifestyle or she would be dead before she was 35.

Shortly after, she split with her boyfriend and moved back home with her parents. She recalls: 'I wanted to lose weight and was a sucker for a fad diet.

'First I tried cutting out sugar, then I tried a low-carb diet.

'I tried the Paleo and Atkins diets but never managed to stick to anything for more than a few weeks and nothing seemed to shift the weight.'

By the summer of 2012, Jess was feeling helpless - but then she heard about app My Fitness Pal. She says: 'A friend told me about it and I thought I would give it a go.

It allowed me to put in my height, weight and goal weight and it told me to eat no more than 1,600 calories a day.'

The app outlined her new diet - to eat 50 per cent carbs, 30 per cent fat and 20 per cent protein - and although she stuck to the plan at first, she began to struggle to keep herself motivated. Then Instagram came into play.

Jess found that looking at other people's weight-loss journeys helped her motivate her on her own

She says: 'A friend had told me about all the healthy-eating accounts on Instagram, so at first I used the search function to look for ideas. It really helped to see other people's weight-loss journeys and it made me realise I could share mine.'

Motivated to ditch chocolate and crisps, Jess started cooking Instagram-inspired meals from scratch and sharing them.

She received many likes from other healthy eaters and, once her cooking skills got up to scratch, began creating her own healthy recipes and sharing them.

Only two months later, Jess had lost three stone and gained hundreds of followers.

She says: 'Once I plucked up confidence I joined the gym when I'd lost about 4st. This is when I started taking post-workout pictures.

'I started to post almost everything I ate and uploaded post-workout photos to show my followers how much I'd worked out. I did mostly cardio as I was too scared to use the weights.

'People commented on how good I looked and it was just the confidence boost I needed to carry on.'

By last December, two and a half years into her regime, Jess had lost a mighty nine stone.

She says: 'If it wasn't for Instagram, I'd still weigh 22st. You can try all the fad diets but all you need is to eat healthily and to have some encouragement. I've never been happier.'
