Runner Richard Whitehead came from last place to win an astonishing gold medal for Team GB in today's 400m T42 final.

A capacity crowd in the Olympic Stadium roared as the 36-year-old managed an incredible fightback in the final 200m before finishing in a new world record time of 24.38 seconds.

Whitehead's achievement is all the more impressive considering he only took up sprinting after he was ruled ineligible from entering his main event, the marathon.

 more than a second in a high quality race in which every single 
competitor ran at least a personal best.

Whitehead
 lapped up the support, performing his take on the Royal wave, as Usain 
Bolt did ahead of his Olympic 200m final, when introduced to the crowd, 
with a faulty start adding to the tension.

He only entered the 200m after 
International Paralympic Committee regulations prevented him from 
competing alongside arm amputees in the T46 marathon in the capital,

He challenged the
 rule at the Court of Arbitration for Sport last year but failed - 
leaving the 100m and 200m as the only events in his category.

Speaking after his breathtaking run, 
Whitehead said: 'Today I came and saw and conquered. That's why I gave 
the two-gun salute at the end.

'Yesterday
 I didn't feel too well. I had a headache and a bit of a temperature. 
But I overcame that, I've overcome so much in my life.

'Today
 was about giving back everyone here a performance. I've got all the 
support around me and that is why I'm successful. I'd like to dedicate 
the gold to my mum and dad and my girlfriend.

'I've still got the 100 to come which will be about putting my foot down.'

Whitehead now has six days to recover before the 100m heats and finals on September 7

Elsewhere Neil Fachie and Barney Storey won Great Britain's third gold medal of the Paralympic Games track cycling programme with a scintillating display in the tandem one-kilometre time-trial at the London 2012 velodrome - but there was mechanical heartache for Anthony Kappes and Craig MacLean.

Fachie, who is partially sighted and competed in athletics in Beijing in 2008, and pilot Storey clocked a world record of one minute 01.351 seconds.

Kappes, who won the event in partnership with Storey in 2008, and MacLean suffered two mishaps and were denied a third opportunity to start by race officials.

The duo, world champions in February, had been scheduled to start last, but two chain failures saw their competition come to an end.

Spain's Jose Enrique Porto and Jose Antonio Villanueva took silver in 1:02.707, with Ireland's Jason Brown and Damien Shaw ninth in 1:07.979.

Paralympic Games organisers apologised today for a scoring blunder that caused the wrong medals to be awarded in women's discus.

The announcement came just hours after Ukraine's Mariia Pomazan proudly received her gold medal.

The athlete had hailed her win as 'extremely emotional' and an 'unforgettable experience'.

But her gold medal win dream was dashed as organisers confirmed the placings in the F35/36 were incorrect - and relegated her into silver position.

China's Wu Qing was promoted to the gold medal position from second, and her compatriot, Bao Jiongyu, dropped from bronze to fourth.

Chris Holmes, Locog director of Paralympic integration, said: 'Omega have explained what the issue was in terms of the loading of the correct data, it's been worked through and resolved and obviously Omega and we also apologise for that.

'We are confident that it won't occur again.'
