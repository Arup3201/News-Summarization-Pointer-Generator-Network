Fraudster: Mohammed Khatana has been ordered to pay back £1.3million he made through scams

A fraudster who posed as a lawyer and offered 'expert' legal advice to criminals has been told to pay back £1.3million he stole from the taxpayer.

Despite having no legal qualifications or accreditation, Mohammed Khatana set up a cowboy consultancy firm offering guidance to crooks that faced having cash and assets seized by police under proceeds of crime laws.

The 51-year-old father-of-three - who used his own daughter to act as a front for his scam - then charged vastly inflated fees for his 'services' which he claimed from the taxpayer-funded legal aid scheme.

Last September Khatana, of Brierfield,
 near Burnley was jailed for eight and a half years after he admitted 15
 charges of fraud.

He has now been given six months to pay the money back or face another six years in prison.

In a written judgement Judge Graham 
Knowles QC said of Khatana: 'He is a professional career criminal who is
 resilient and flexible.

'He does not regard imprisonment so 
much as an occupational hazard as a necessary part of the work to be 
done to obtain money from his crimes, albeit paid in arrears.

'I have regard to his history of 
criminality, his use of his mother’s accounts to conceal the financial 
realities, to sham property transactions, to the known existence of the 
Pakistani bank account and to his failure to provide any information 
about it.

'I find it inherently improbable this
 man would not commit offences without making very large profits. The 
likelihood is that he took large fees for concealing the assets of other
 criminals and that he has hidden them or their proceeds.'

Preston Crown Court was told how the former property dealer - who drove a Mercedes and lived in a five bedroom house on a private estate in rural Lancashire - advertised his services via a website and in prison newspapers.

He would visit clients in jail, discuss their needs, then go away and procure the necessary services for the criminals from solicitors' firms.

Khatana would then double the genuine firm's quoted price, submit a legal aid claim to the Legal Services Commission, and pocket the difference himself.

The court was also told how the British Muslim used 'cultural pressure' to make his daughter Mahria Khatana participate in his scheming, having her join a lawyers' association and network with defence solicitors and barristers at trade functions.

When one of her father's sizeable legal aid claims was queried by a judge, the 25-year-old verified it in court.

Khatana was arrested as he left a hotel near Bury after an undercover  operation led by detectives from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit, following a three year investigation into his shady firm POCA Consulting Ltd.

The sting saw an undercover policewoman pose as the girlfriend of a client to meet with Khatana, who offered her advice on how to keep her partner's money out of the reach of authorities at a cost of £20,000.

The court heard how Khatana billed one 74-year-old client facing confiscation proceedings for money laundering £43,000. He should have been charged just £10,000.

The money was recouped by the Khatanas through legal aid at the expense of the taxpayer.

Mohammed Khatana was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to 15 counts of fraud.

Mahria Khatana, who admitted four counts of fraud, was given a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work.

Passing sentence, Judge Graham Knowles QC told Khatana senior: 'Your plan from the beginning was that this business would be a vehicle for fraud.

'You are a determined and persistent and versatile professional criminal. What you did was intended to undermine the whole legal process.'

Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson from the North West Regional Organised Crime Unit said: 'Khatana was a ruthless serial fraudster who was prepared to use his own daughter to steal from a wide range of individuals for his own gain.

'Cheating the taxpayer is not a victimless crime especially in these difficult times - yet this man has shown little remorse.'

Matthew Coats, chief executive of the Legal Services Commission, said: 'Legal aid funding is public money and we will not tolerate people trying to defraud the taxpayer.'

Mohammed Khatana has previously served time in jail for his part in smuggling amphetamine 'pill-making' machines into Britain from China during the 1990s.

In a later scam he sent letters to companies up and down the country offering to register them under the then new Data Protection Act, and warning them that they could be prosecuted if they did not pay up.

The firms were charged a fee of £135 for Khatana's 'service', when the true cost of registering was £35.

He was jailed for four years in December 2004 and ordered to pay back almost £500,000.

It was upon his release from prison that Khatana set up his shady legal advice firm POCA Consulting Ltd.

Detective Chief Inspector Paula Parker, head of the North West Regional Asset Recovery Team said: 'Khatana was a ruthless and serial fraudster who was prepared to use his daughter to steal from a wide range of people for his own gain. It was clear he was making a large profit by abusing the legal aid system.'

'We will do everything we can to investigate the finances of people who we believe have obtained their money illegally, and then work with the courts to remove negative role models from society and take their wealth off them.'
