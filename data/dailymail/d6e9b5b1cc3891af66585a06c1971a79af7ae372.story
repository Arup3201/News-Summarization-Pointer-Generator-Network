Superfoods are the staple of many a modern woman's diet.

From model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's 
beloved wheatgrass-packed green juice to Miranda Kerr's favourite Kale chips there are plenty of stars who are walking adverts for the power of vitamins and beauty boosting fruits.

But their kitchen staples are set to be replaced by a new arsenal of super fruits you've probably never heard of...yet.

Mangosteen, kohlrabi and black rice are tipped to be this season's most potent aids in boosting our health - but what are they and how can you incorporate them into your diet?

Famous fans: Miranda Kerr (left) and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley put green juices on the map, but will they champion the latest super fruits? 

Mangosteen is a tropical fruit native
 to Southeast Asia and is touted for being packed with antioxidants, 
particularly the rare xanthones - hailed for their anti-ageing 
properties.

It has also been claimed that it helps the immune system, improves joint flexibility, and provides mental support.

In some countries where it grows, it is used to cure diarrhea, infections, tuberculosis, and a host of other illnesses.

Most commonly available in juice form from Thai supermarkets, its 
fruit, rind and pulp are pureed together and can be mixed with other 
types of juice.

New kids on the block: Mangosteen is one of the super fruits touted to take the health world by storm. It helps the immune system, improves joint flexibility, and provides mental support

The low calorie fruit, which is high in fibre, can also be dried and turned into a powder.

Speaking about the hot new super fruit on the block, Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at www.nutricentre.com, said: 'Mangosteen tastes delicious. It
 is low in calories and rich in fibre - a great snack for weight 
management. 

'It is also a good source of the antioxidant Vitamin C and great for energy levels. It 
contains B vitamins such as thiamine, niacin and folates. These act
 as co-factors and help the body to metabolise carbohydrates, proteins 
and fats. Overall, a great nutrient dense fruit.'

Celebrity nutritionist, Madeleine Shaw, who works with Millie Mackintosh, described it as an 'awesome fruit'.

'Don't
 be scared by its strange appearance. It contains lots of vitamin C to 
ward off colds and acts as an anti-inflammatory. It's amazing with a dollop of fresh organic yogurt,' she said.

If you never quite jumped onto the kale bandwagon or are tiring of its acquired taste then Kohlrabi could be the perfect option.

Potent: It has been claimed that Mangosteen helps the immune system, improves joint flexibility, and provides mental support. While black rice (right) is loaded with iron and vitamin E and has more anthocyanin antioxidants than blueberries

Nutrient dense: Kohlrabi is a turnip-like plant packed with 
fibre to help with the digestive system. It has high nutrient to calorie
 ration so great for people watching their weight

Kohlrabi comes from the cabbage family and is already a firm favourite of Germans and South Indians thanks to its high antioxidant properties.

Food blogger Amy Pantlin said: 'It can be eaten raw cut into wedges for snacks with creamy dips, or can be shredded to add a crunch to salads and slaws. It's so versatile.'

It can be used to thicken soups or stews, or boiled and added to mashed potatoes or roasted as an alternative to carbs.

Speaking about its benefits, Shona Wilkinson said: 'It is a great source of vitamin C which can help the immune system.

'It is also a good source of fibre to help with the digestive system. It has high nutrient to calorie ration so great for people watching their weight.'

Sip the goodness: Thought to be approximately ten times more potent than regular brewed green tea, matcha can raise energy levels, boost metabolism and help regulate blood sugar levels

Guy Watson, founder of Riverford.co.uk, said: 'Kohlrabi tends to be thought of as a root vegetable, but in botanical or morphological terms they are the swollen stem base of a cabbage.

'Flavourwise, kohlrabi is somewhere between a large radish, a French-style summer turnip and a broccoli stem, with an appley crunch and mild taste.

'More of a light and refreshing vegetable than leafy, iron-rich kale, their flavour and texture works well in a salad, either finely sliced or grated, and perhaps with carrots - think mild turnip when planning the flavour.

'They can also be stir-fried, steamed or boiled and while the leaves are sparse they are very tender and can be eaten like greens, so try not to waste them.

'Kohlrabi certainly causes many inquiring calls to our customer services teams on the farms when they first appear in our vegboxes, but they generally go down well once customers know what to do with them.'

If you're looking for an alternative to coffee and are bored of green, white and even black tea, matcha tea is set to be hot businesses.

Thought to be approximately ten times more potent than regular brewed green tea, matcha can raise energy levels, boost metabolism and help regulate blood sugar levels without the 'high and low' effect that caffeine can often have.

Shona Wilkinson explained: 'Matcha tea has a very high ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) value. With its potent antioxidant properties it is a great product to help protect the body against free-radical damage.

'It also contains good levels of L-Theanine, an amino acid which is able to exert a relaxing effect on the body. The tea has high levels of chlorophyll too.'

Madeleine added: 'Matcha tea is loaded with antioxidants to keep your skin young and glowing. I love to have a cup of tea with some coconut oil in to help with afternoon sugar cravings.'

Bored of quinoa? Make way for black rice - a gluten-free, fibre rich grain linked to great heart health.

'Black rice is extremely high in antioxidants, explained Shona. 'In particular anthocyanins which are thought to help prevent the build up of plaque in the arteries - therefore great for helping the cardiovascular system.'

Madeleine added: 'It's loaded with iron and vitamin E. This grain has more anthocyanin antioxidants than blueberries.'
