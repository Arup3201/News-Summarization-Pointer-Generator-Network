Accused: Summer Michelle Hansen has been charged with sex crimes involving underage boys

A special education teacher has been charged today after allegedly having sex with several of her students who stayed behind after class.

Summer Michelle Hansen, 31, faces 16 felony counts for alleged sex crimes involving five underage boys.

She was freed on bail and is due to be arraigned on Thursday in Corona, California.Â 

Hansen has been charged with multiple counts of engaging in unlawful sex and oral copulation of a minor.

If found guilty, she could face up to 13 years in prison.

The married mother-of-three came under investigation after a former student at Centennial High School came forward to say he had sex with Hansen.

She was arrested in June and placed on administrative leave while officials tried to determine how many students she had sex with.

Parents were told at the time to talk to their children to see if they had any unwarranted contact with Hansen.

The crimes allegedly took place in her classroom, a school utility room, her car and at one victim's home, according to KTLA.

It is not believed that the students were taught by her at the time but all were under the age of 18.

Parents at the school were stunned by the arrest two months ago.

'It surprises me that any 31-year-old
adult, married woman is having sex with a child, teacher or otherwise,'
said parent Angela Thompson.
