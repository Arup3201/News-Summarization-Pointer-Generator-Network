Tragedy: Darren Booker was shot dead on Sunday night after apparently playing a deadly game of Russian roulette

A 13-year-old boy in Florida has died after apparently playing a deadly game of Russian roulette with a 15-year-old friend on Sunday night.

Redland Middle School student, Darren Booker, was struck in the chest after his friend emptied a gun of all but one bullet and proceeded to aim at Booker and pull the trigger three times.

Friends of the teen said that the seventh-grader was shot outside a home in Florida City and despite the best efforts of emergency services to rush him to hospital, Booker died.

Police have said that a group of teens were playing with the firearm before the fatal shooting.

'(They were) Playing with the gun,' said one witness to WSVN.

'They
 were just trying to see like the parts of it. He was trying to take the
 bullets out but he left one in,' said Ashley Kendall.

'And he pointed it at hiim and shot it, nothing happened. Shot it again, nothing happened.

'The third time, Book got shot in the chest.'

The tragic and foolish game that killed the popular football player took place around 9pm at the 1300 block of Northwest 4th avenue.

'My cousin who came in the house, they was like, 'Oh, somebody's shot, somebody's shot,' and he told his mama and we came outside,' said another friend.

'I guess by the time we came outside, Darren, he hit the gate and he fell and he kind of like was taking his last breath.'
