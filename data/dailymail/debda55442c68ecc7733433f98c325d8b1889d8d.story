Julian Fellowes' drama Titanic and the hit show Birdsong are both recent productions made overseas rather than in Britain.

But a new tax relief which comes into effect this week aims to encourage high-end TV series and animation to be made in the UK instead.

To make London the 'city of choice' for top-class series - such as the next generation of Mad Men and The Sopranos - and support home-grown talent, Boris Johnson has earmarked £750,000 for these sectors.

U.S. executives and animators will be 
shown around the capital's cutting-edge facilities, as well as venues 
such as the Olympic Park, later this year in an attempt to woo them.

To make London the 'city of choice' for top-class series - such as the next generation of Mad Men (above) - and support home-grown talent, Boris Johnson has earmarked £750,000 for the TV and animation industries

The money will be invested in TV and TV 
animation through Film London, an agency that helps UK productions, 
along with this year's existing £1.3million budget.

The aim is to create 1,000 jobs and bring in £200million worth of expenditure - building on success stories shot in London such as the BBC's Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch.

Speaking at Ealing Studios, the Mayor of London said: 'We are at the dawn of a new golden age of TV production in London.

'We want to make sure 
we're not losing money to places like Hungary or Ireland where they are 
making TV shows that could well be shot in London.

'We 
have an unprecedented opportunity to grow this exciting sector to 
deliver jobs, produce more world-class British drama and, above all, 
make London the city of choice for TV and animation production.

'It’s time for London to fulfil its 
potential as the world leader and employer it’s destined to be in this 
field. Let’s make sure that all future Downtons are filmed on our turf.'

Ealing Studios is home to the
Downton Abbey set, as well as the pioneering ‘performance capture’ 
special effects studio Imaginarium.

At the studios, Mr Johnson attempted 
directing an animation scene in the special effects studio where Gollum 
from The Lord Of The Rings was created.

He joked: 'Would I be interested in 
being in a film? You betcha. But no one's curiously made me an offer. I 
think the movie industry is moving along without me at the moment.

'Who would I have to play me? You mean, apart from Brad Pitt obviously.'

Lord Hall, director-general of the BBC, said: 'These are certainly exciting times for television production.

'The capital is already one of the most TV-friendly cities in the world and we look forward to continuing to play our part in this vital part of the British broadcasting ecology.'

Julian Fellowes, creator of Downton Abbey, said: 'It is encouraging to feel that the tremendous, worldwide success of British high-end television is at last receiving some recognition and help.'

Already enjoying tax relief for film, London is now the third busiest city in the world for film-making after LA and New York.

Film London, already working to facilitate major motion pictures shot in the capital, generated £770million in investment over the last four years alone and hopes are running high for the agency’s expansion into high-end TV, such as dramas, mini-series, franchise shows, international co-productions and animations.

Last year, Wallace and Gromit-creator Aardman Animations warned they would have to move production overseas because they could no longer compete in Britain.

The agency has been working with the Mayor since 2003 to deliver production opportunities and has the unique skills and expertise to help TV companies – many small businesses – who lack experience working with tax relief or securing inward investment.

Andy Serkis and Jonathan Cavendish, founders of The Imaginarium said: 'For us, basing the Imaginarium in London is crucial. We have set up Europe's leading Performance Capture studio here because of access to the best creative people and the most interesting clients, partners and co-venturers in the field of next generation story-telling.

'The introduction of tax relief beyond film to animation, games and television is very important to our business, and helps us in setting up our Academy to train young people into the digital future.'

David Parfitt, Chairman of Film London said: 'With these new opportunities in the television, animation and games industries, we can cement London's reputation as the greatest city in the world for all visual arts.'

James Spring, CEO Managing Director of Film and Television at Ealing Studios said: 'Ealing Studios are delighted that the government is continuing its support for the creative industries.

'The extension of the tax credit system for high-end TV has already led to increased activity from foreign productions as well as UK originated television. '
