Britain is prepared to take its sanctions against Russia to a ‘whole different level’ if Vladimir Putin ramps up his aggression, David Cameron has said.

The Prime Minister said the Russian president has ‘ripped up’ the rule book and could not expect still to have access to international markets and finance.

He said the West must be prepared to ‘settle in for a long and determined position’ against the Moscow government and that further incursions into Ukraine should be punished.

Mr Cameron told the Wall Street Journal: ‘If Russia is going to rip up the rule book of the 21st century and destabilise a sovereign country, then the rest of the world should be prepared to say to Russia, well you can’t rip up one part of the international rule book while still having access to international markets, international finance, international systems.’

On continuing tensions in Ukraine, Mr Cameron said leaders had agreed to implement tougher sanctions against Russia if the ceasefire fails. Despite last month’s ceasefire, violence has continued to flare up across the region.

Mr Cameron also reiterated his commitment to hold an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union in 2017.

While he believes the ‘right answer’ is for Britain to remain in the EU, Mr Cameron said he accepted that the country might vote to leave.

He added: ‘You can’t stay in an organisation if your employer, the British public, doesn’t consent to it.’

The conflict in the east of Ukraine has plunged ties between Russia and the West to Cold War-era lows as Kiev, along with the US and the EU, say they have evidence that Moscow is arming the rebels and boosting their ranks with regular army soldiers. Russia has denied the accusations.

The threat of an immediate cut to the gas supply from Russia to Ukraine was averted yesterday. Russian gas exporter Gazprom said it had received a prepayment that was enough to cover about five days of supply.
