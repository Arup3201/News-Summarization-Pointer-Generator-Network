A special education teacher in Philadelphia has been accused of having a sex at least ten times with a 14-year-old student.

Stephanie Amato, a teacher at Ethan Allen School, handed herself in to authorities at the Special Victims Unit on Wednesday night.

The 30-year-old has been charged with offenses including involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, statutory sexual assault and corruption of a minor.

According to the District Attorney’s office, Amato had been engaged in a sexual relationship with the boy during March and April of this year.

The alleged encounters happened in her car and at her home. The two were allegedly sending explicit text messages and Amato told him not to tell.

Tasha Jamerson, spokeswoman for District Attorney Seth Williams, called the sex ‘consensual," according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.

When the boy's father discovered the relationship, he pulled his son from the school.

Stephanie Amato was released early on Thursday after posting 10 percent of bail set at $125,000, according to court records

The child's father, who we are not identifying, spoke exclusively to Action News.

'I was very upset. She took my kid's youth and I really want justice to take care of this woman,' he told WPVI. 'He's not doing too well, he doesn't want to go to school. He feels humiliated, since that happened he changed.'

The allegations against Amato were first made in April, said Philadelphia School District spokesman Fernando Gallard.

School officials then notified city and school police, and the teacher was removed her from the classroom pending an investigation.

Amato, who has been a teacher for six years, was also barred from having contact with her students.

On Tuesday she posted several photos on Facebook of her posing with some of her students. One picture is captioned ‘My fav students!!’

In another photo - captioned ‘Fun with these kids!’ - Amato is sitting in a car surrounded by four young men.

An unnamed source at the school told the Inquirer that Amato would often spend time out of school with groups of her students.

She is currently suspended with pay, but after an administrative hearing next week she could lose her pay.

Parents were only informed of Amato's arrest through a letter sent home this week.

Principal Cassandra Houston said that the district is 'working closely with the Philadelphia Police Department's Special Victims Unit to ensure that a thorough investigation is conducted.'

Amato was released early on Thursday after posting 10 percent of bail set at $125,000, according to court records.
