A man who gained nationwide celebrity status on social media as 'Kai the hatchet-weilding hitchiker' today pleaded not guilty to a charge of killing a 73-year-old lawyer in the victim's New Jersey home in May.

Caleb McGillivary, 24 - who shot to online infamy in February after a TV interview went viral - stood silent during his arraignment before Superior Court Judge Joseph Donohue.

McGillivary's attorney, Union County Public Defender Peter Liguori, filed the not guilty plea to the charge of murder in the beating death of Joseph Galfy, according to Nj.com

Liguori said he could not comment on the case, but acknowledged that McGillivary is feeling better than he did shortly after his arrest.

A YouTube video in February made Caleb McGillivary an internet star following a hitchiking incident in California. He had been picked up by a man who 'believed he was Jesus' and hit a gas station worker with his car. McGillvary subdued the man with the back of a hatchet

'He's doing better than he was a couple of months ago,' Liguori said.

In July, McGillivary was rushed from the Union County jail in Elizabeth to a hospital for treatment of self-inflicted wounds following an apparent suicide attempt.

He was later returned to the jail.

McGillivary is suspected of beating Galfy, a partner in a Rahway law firm, in Galfy's home on May 12, about 24 hours after the two met in Manhattan's Times Square, authorities have said, following a sexual tryst.

McGillivary is said to have gone to Galfy's home and stayed the night.

The next day Galfy, the attorney for the Green Brook land use board, drove McGillvary to the Rahway Train station, from where the younger man left for Asbury Park.

McGillvary returned to Rahway later in the day.

After exchanging text messages, Galfy picked him up and brought him back to his house.

Police allege the killing happened sometime that evening.

The next day, Monday May 13, police went to Galfy's home after he did not show up for work or answer his phone.

They found Galfy dead in his bed, wearing only underwear and socks.

Authorities say McGillivary beat Galfy, then left for Asbury Park and later headed to Philadelphia with a friend.

On May 14, McGillivary, who is originally from Canada, wrote a post on his Facebook page intimating he was drugged and sexually assaulted, but did not say where or when.

The post read: 'what would you do if you woke up with a groggy head, metallic taste in your mouth, in a strangers house ... and started wretching, realizing that someone had drugged (and) raped ... you? what would you do.'

Then-Union County Prosecutor Theodore Romankow has called those comments 'self-serving'.

heroics, and he was even invited by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel (right)
 to appear on his show

McGillivary was arrested two days later in Philadelphia after a Starbucks staffer recognized his distinctive facial tattoo and called police.

McGillivary became a minor internet celebrity in California last February when hitchhiking.

After he was picked up, he used the handle of a hatchet to subdue the driver when that man tried to kill a utility worker with his car, which is how he earned his moniker.

McGillivary attracted fans across the country, mostly through Facebook and Twitter, and did a few chat show interviews, including Jimmy Kimmel.
