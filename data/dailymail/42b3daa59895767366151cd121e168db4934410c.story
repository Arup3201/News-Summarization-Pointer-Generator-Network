Retired Italian rider Roberto Gaggioli says Lance Armstrong paid him $100,000 in 1993 in order to win the Million Dollar Race in the United States.

'It was a young American colleague,' Gaggioli, who is now 51, was quoted as saying. 'He offered me a panettone (a traditional Italian Christmas cake) as a present and wished me a merry Christmas. In the box there were $100,000 in small bills. That colleague was Lance Armstrong.

'Lance said that my team, Coors Light, had agreed to it. I understood that it had all been decided,' added Gaggioli in reference to Armstrong's win in the CoreStates race in Philadelphia which was crucial to him winning the one million dollar prize for the victor of three races held over 21 days.

The Million Dollar Race was also known as the Thrift Drug Triple Crown, comprising races in Pittsburgh, West Virginia and Philadelphia. Gaggioli says Armstrong made his pastry payoff before the final leg in Philly

Lance won: 'When Lance made a sign, I turned away as if not to see that he had escaped. He broke away to win on his own' Roberto Gaggioli says

The Million Dollar Race, which was 
known as the Thrift Drug Triple Crown, was comprised of the Pittsburgh 
Classic, the West Virginia Classic and the CoreStates race.

The Italian Gaggioli raced for the majority of his career in the United States and was racing for the Coors Light team in Philadelphia, an event he had previously won in 1988, while Armstrong was riding for Motorola.

Gaggioli's New Zealand teammate Stephen Swart - who later rode for Motorola with Armstrong - has previously testified that Armstrong paid out $50,000 to be distributed among the Coors Light team during the second race of the series in West Virginia.

Swart made the claim in 2006 when he provided evidence during court action between SCA Promotions and Armstrong over unpaid bonuses following his sixth Tour de France win.

'Lance approached me before the start [in Philadelphia]. He said that my team, Coors Light, was in agreement and spoke to me about the compensation: $100,000,' said Gaggioli.

'Two
 laps from the end, I was in a breakaway with Lance, Bobby Julich and 
some Italian riders from the Mercatone team. When Lance made a sign, I 
turned away as if not to see that he had escaped. He broke away to win 
on his own.'

Let him eat cake: Roberto Gaggioli says he deliberately lost the one million dollar race in order to let Lance Armstrong win twenty years ago

The newspaper 
added that other riders also failed to respond to Armstrong's attack 
because they too had been bought, and cited one, Roberto Pelliconi, who 
said: 'Angelo Canzonieri (another rider) and Lance agreed on a fee of 
50, Angelo thought he meant dollars but Lance meant lire.

'At the Tour of Lombardy he gave us 50 million (lire).'

Armstrong,
 who was riding for Motorola at the time and is now 42, was officially 
stripped of his seven Tour de France wins in 2012 after being found 
guilty of a string of doping offences.

He publicly admitted that he had cheated earlier this year...
