Ronald Koeman has been appointed as Southampton's new boss on a three-year-deal.

The 51-year-old will replace Mauricio Pochettino in the St Mary's hotseat following his move to Premier League rivals Tottenham in May.

Southampton executive director Les Reed said in a statement: 'From the moment we met with Ronald, it was clear he had the vision and ambition to take our club forward, that he shared our football philosophy and could see the opportunity to move our club to the next level.

'The club, the players and the fans will all be excited to have a man of Ronald's experience at the very highest level joining our club.

'Ronald's passion for the opportunity here at St Mary's was very clear, and we look forward to continuing our growth with him as part of our team.'

Upon moving to the south coast club Koeman, who stepped down from his role as manager at Dutch outfit Feyenoord after guiding them to second place in the Eredivisie last season, will bring his brother Erwin as assistant manager.

Koeman said: 'I am thrilled to be the manager of Southampton Football Club.

'From my very first meeting with Les Reed, I could see clearly that this was the right club for me. We share the same philosophy of football, and the same belief in how to develop the club.

'Southampton have a talented first-team squad, a world-class academy and the infrastructure to sustain success in the Premier League.

'The opportunity to continue the development of this famous football club was simply too good to turn down. I cannot wait to get started.'

On the move? Croatia defender Dejan Lovren has been linked with a summer transfer away from Southampton

The Dutchman comes with a reputation for an attacking brand of football and a commitment to promoting young talent which will sit well with Southampton who have nurtured the likes of Gareth Bale, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers in recent seasons.

Koeman, who won the European Championship with Holland and the European Cup with PSV in 1988 and with Barcelona four years later as a player, has also managed Ajax, Benfica, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia and AZ Alkmaar.

He played 763 games for club and country, scoring 253 goals - including the winner for Barcelona against Sampdoria in the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley.

The Dutchman inherits a Saints side who finished eighth in the Premier League in the previous campaign.

One of his first tasks at Southampton will be to find a replacement for England international Rickie Lambert who signed for his boyhood club Liverpool in a Â£4million deal in May.

As well as replacing Lambert, Koeman will have a fight on his hands to keep intergral trio Luke Shaw, Dejan Lovren and captain Adam Lallana at the club - who have all been linked away with a move this summer.
