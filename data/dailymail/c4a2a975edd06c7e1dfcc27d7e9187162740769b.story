A woman who attacked a coffee bar owner over an unpaid bill has opened a rival tea shop a short distance away in the same village.

Jayne Haworth, 50, and brother Mark Taylor, 53, were convicted after a violent bust up against Linda Cartwright, 53, and daughter Elizabeth, 20

The brother and sister had held a party in the Cartwright’s Orchid Coffee Bar in the village of Longton, Lancashire, but there was a dispute over an outstanding £80.

A month later Haworth and Taylor launched a verbal tirade against the mother and daughter - which ended in Elizabeth being attacked.

They were eventually found guilty of assault charges but while they waited to stand trial, Haworth opened her own cafe.

She now runs Mad Hatters Tea Shop and Patisserie - just 500m from the Cartwright’s coffee bar.

Speaking today, Ms Cartwright claims the rival shop has been opened out of spite.

She said: 'It has been a nightmare for me and my daughter.

'They attacked my daughter and left her arm covered in bruising.

'I’m convinced she’s opened a rival coffee shop just up the road to try and put my business under.

'She has no catering background so I think it must be done maliciously. I worked hard for two and a half years to set up my business so I’m determined to carry on.

Mark Taylor was found guilty of assault and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour and sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £15

'It’s awful what has happened and now life isn’t good for us.

'I’m one of the world’s fighters so I’ll carry on the best I can.'

Magistrates in Preston, Lancashire, heard Haworth held her birthday celebrations at the Orchid Coffee Bar in March but there was a bill dispute.

A month later, on April 26, Elizabeth Cartwright, then 19, and Linda hung up their aprons after a shift and headed for an evening at the local pub.

It was later that night the mother and daughter bakers saw Haworth and Taylor, who shouted abuse and attacked Elizabeth.

Following the attack police were called and Haworth was charged with assaulting Elizabeth and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour.

Taylor was charged with assault and using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent

Both defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges but were found guilty after a trial.

Haworth, of Longton, was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £100 compensation, a £15 victim surcharge and costs of £46

Her brother was sentenced to a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay a victim surcharge of £15.

An appeal has been launched by Haworth and Taylor over the result of the case, and Taylor has launched a private civil prosecution against Elizabeth Cartwright.

Haworth refused to comment today.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
