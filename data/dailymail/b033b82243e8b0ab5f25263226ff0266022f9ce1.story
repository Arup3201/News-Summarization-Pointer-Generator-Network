Anna Flanagan, according to FHM, is the hottest girl to look out for at the Games

Glaswegians are going ga ga over Australia's gold medal hopefuls with three of our athletes deemed the Commonwealth Games' hottest by men's mag FHM.

Readers have been given the tough task of keeping an eye out for podium princesses Anna Flanagan, Melissa Breen and Genevieve LaCaze who were named in the gold, silver and bronze spots for the best looking female athletes.

Two other home-grown Scottish athletes and a Canadian ranked in the minor placings, who according to to FHM are the 'sexiest Commonwealth Games ladies that you need to be paying attention to right now'.

Hockeyroo and 22-year-old Flanagan, who turned heads when she posed for a Games' promotional shoot in a Scottish kilt, is a law student and journalism graduate back home.

Her teammates, 23-year-old Breen and LaCaze, 24, are both representing their country at the track but all three are turning heads away from the sporting arena.

The Glasgow glamours have all been active on social media during Scottish expedition and are earning adorning fans of the Games the world over.

All three came in the top three ahead of Canadian, Wendy Dorr, and Scottish born stars Gemma Nicol and Rebecca Bee.

The 24 year old Flanagan is in action for the Hockeyroos at Glasgow and has played more than 100 tests for her country

Anna Flanagan was named World Hockey player of the year in 2013

Melissa Breen, a 100m sprinter, is into the semi finals of competition but has already won over many adoring fans for her good looks

According to her online bio, 23-year-old Flanagan is better known as 'Flanno' - the Hockeyroo defender who has amassed more than 100 tests for her country and 15 goals.

She was named Hockeyâ€™s 2013 World Young Player of the Year and became only the third Australian woman to receive the award.

She is lining up with her Hockeyroos teammates to defend their Commonwealth Games gold.

LaCaze, an Aussie steeplechase specialist, is coming back from a stress fracture injury in her right foot for these games.

The Brisbane native now lives in the US and is dating Aussie middle distance runner Ryan Gregson.

She told the Courier Mail about her chances at the Games: 'I know I am good enough to medal if I keep up my progress for the next few months.'

Melissa Breen has already comfortably cruised into the semi-final of her pet event the 100m sprint.

The national 100m record holder blew out the cobwebs by winning the second heat in 11.54sec in cool conditions at Hampden Park.

She rates idol Melinda Gainsford-Taylor as her biggest inspiration and ranked the 2012 London Games as her most rewarding career goal to date.

She has told her closest fans and followers that the next three years will be very rewarding: 'The next three years are going to be the most exciting and I look forward to sharing these wonderful moments and experiences with you.'
