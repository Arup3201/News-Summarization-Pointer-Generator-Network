A computer system handling the  Government’s flagship Universal Credit scheme cannot cope with the ‘complicated’ lives led by millions of families, ministers admitted yesterday.

The Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) will today announce £40million of new IT equipment has already been written off.

A further £91million of bespoke software will become defunct when the system is operational in 2017, although the department insisted this was ‘not a write-off’.

Pressure: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith was grilled by MPs about the costs and timings of his flagship welfare reform

The computer system is so limited that
benefits claims involving couples or  families have to be dealt with 
manually, MPs were told yesterday.

Work
and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith angrily denied the scheme was 
in chaos, telling the Commons work and pensions committee: ‘There is no 
debacle on Universal Credit.’

But
trouble-shooter Howard Shiplee, who was brought in this year to rescue 
the £2.4billion scheme, said it still faced major challenges in dealing 
with all but the most straightforward benefit claims.

He said the 
automated system could not currently deal with claims involving couples 
or children. A tiny pilot scheme involving just 2,000 people had focused
almost exclusively on young single men, whose claims are 
straightforward.

Officials 
have to make manual checks if a claimant moves in with a partner or has a
child. The DWP said last night the IT problems had to be set against 
the estimated £38billion of economic benefits that Universal Credit 
could eventually bring.

There is growing unease in government that the most ambitious change to the welfare system for 60 years is falling behind schedule.

The government has abandoned the idea of all services being 'digital by default'.

David Cameron ordered all departments to make the internet the first port of call for all services.

But the man in charge of the huge Universal Credit welfare reform admitted that the benefits would not be 'digital first'.

Howard Shiplee (pictured) was challenged by MPs about the dramatic shift in policy.

The director general of Universal Credit said: 'Digital by default as far as I am concerned went away a long time ago. That's my understanding very clearly.'

He went on: 'It is working. There is this constant suggestion it is not working. It works.'

Labour has seized on figures which 
show that only a tiny fraction of the numbers due to be using the new 
system by the time of the 2015 general election would be transferred on 
time.

Only a ‘handful’ of 
the promised 1.7 million would be switched by 2014-15 and only 400,000 
by the following year - less than 10 per cent of the original target, 
the Opposition said.

As recently as October Mr Duncan Smith insisted his it was still on track.

But he has conceded that as many as 700,000 claimants will now face a longer wait before being transferred to the new system.

Earlier he refused to comment on Labour’s
figures, but admitted: ‘I do accept, of course, that this plan is 
different from the original plan.’

Some 700,000 disabled people will not be transferred by the deadline because of the complexity of their claims. Millions of other benefit claimants who were due to be transferred to the new system in the next 18 months will now not do so until well after the election.

The delay is embarrassing for Mr Duncan Smith, who has staked his reputation on the delivery of the scheme, which is designed to ensure it always pays people to work.

Universal Credit will combine Jobseeker’s Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit and housing benefit.

Speaking ahead of his appearance before the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, Mr Duncan Smith said the delay was to allow the most vulnerable claimants more time to adjust to the change.

‘We could easily have tried to rush those people in but we have decided not to,’ he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

‘They are the people who don't have any work requirement on them and they have had the biggest change going through the work capability assessment and therefore they need time to get through. I think it is only fair to give them longer.’

Ministers claim the initial roll-out 
of Universal Credit - which combines six means-tested benefits into one 
monthly payment designed to ensure people are better-off working than on
benefits - has been a success.

They
point to figures suggesting it is encouraging more people to look for 
jobs in what Mr Duncan Smith described as a ‘cultural shift’.

But critics say the limited implementation of the scheme - which has been plagued by IT and other problems - only involve the least challenging cases.

And it was branded ‘inadequate’ and open to fraud in a scathing report by a cross-party committee.

The Commons Public Accounts Committee found that at least £140 million had already been wasted on the project, which was blighted by ‘alarmingly weak’ management.

Labour's shadow work and pensions Rachel Reeves said the reforms were now in chaos

In October, Mr Duncan Smith told the Commons: 'Universal credit will roll out very well and it will be on time and within budget.'

Today Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, said the scheme was in chaos and urged Mr Duncan Smith to hold cross-party talks to rescue it.

‘David Cameron and Iain Duncan Smith repeatedly promised to deliver their flagship policy “on time and within budget”.

‘That claim, and the credibility they staked on it, now lie in tatters.

‘For months on end, the Government have tried to avoid answering questions about Universal Credit but these OBR figures tell the truth of how (they) have broken their promises on a spectacular scale.

‘They have been forced to admit that they have completely missed their targets and Universal Credit will not now be rolled out before the election.

‘David Cameron and Iain Duncan Smith are presiding over a complete mess and it is taxpayers who are picking up the bill with at least £100 million of their money written off."

Giving evidence alongside Mr Duncan Smith at the Work and Pensions Select Committee will be Howard Shiplee, the former London Olympics executive drafted in earlier this year to ‘reset’ the programme amid growing concerns over delays and IT issues.

He may also be questioned about reports - which he denies - that he sought to have MPs pin blame for the failures on Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) chief civil servant Robert Devereux.

In written evidence to the committee, the DWP said it was ‘confident that it has taken, and continues to take, the right remedial steps to address past issues in the Universal Credit programme’.
