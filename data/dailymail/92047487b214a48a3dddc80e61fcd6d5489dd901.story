Anderlecht midfielder Steven Defour is gearing up to face the might of Arsenal at the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium tonight and the Belgian midfielder will be wearing an impressive set of custom-made shin guards for the occasion.

Defour posted a picture of his impressive gear on his Instragram account. 

The guards, sporting Defour’s national colours of Belgium, contain portraits of the Anderlecht star and has girlfriend Laura Tropea on each shin.

Defour is not the first player to have his face on his shin pads; Ronaldo (right) also had the idea 

The Belgian signed a five-year deal with Anderlect in August after a three-year spell with Porto. 

Anderlecht opened their Group D European campaign with an impressive 1-1 draw away at Galatasaray.

However, the Belgians, who have finished bottom in all seven group stage campaigns since they reached the last 16 back in 2000, were brought crashing back down to earth in their second match when German giants Dortmund ran out 3-0 winners. 

Arsenal are second in Group D with three points from two matches, three points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund. Anderlecht are third, level on one point with bottom side Galatasaray.
