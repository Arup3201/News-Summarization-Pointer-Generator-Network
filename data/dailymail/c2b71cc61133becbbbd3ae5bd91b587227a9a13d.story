Ethnic Kurds are fighting against their own brethren and helping ISIS to take the town of Kobane by deciphering messages in the Kurdish language and giving information on battlefield terrain.

One of Islamic State's top commanders in Kobane is also Kurdish, a man known as Abu Khattab al-Kurdi - which translates as Abu Khattab the Kurd.

Hundreds of Kurds have joined forces with the Islamic State, but it is not known how many are fighting with the 3,000 ISIS troops in their seven-week battle for Kobane, a strategically key Syrian town on the Turkish border.

Lethal: There are thought to be around 3,000 ISIS troops fighting in the seven-week battle for Kobane, though it is not known exactly how many of them are Kurdish

Fighting their own: According to the People's Protection Brigade (YPG) leaders in Kobane, the Kurds are helping decipher radio messages in the Kurdish language and giving ISIS information on the terrain

Most of those fighters, including al-Kurdi, are thought to come from the town of Halabja in Iraq, though some come from Kobane itself, while others arrived from regions such as Afrin and Jazeera.

Islamic State websites recently published photographs of him - a young bearded man - wearing the traditional Kurdish dress of baggy pants standing in front of dead Kurdish soldiers. 

In Baghdad, an Iraqi security official said al-Kurdi was a member of Ansar al-Islam, a Sunni militant group with ties to al-Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who was killed in 2006. 

Al-Kurdi served with the group for years, and later joined the Islamic State group, the official said.

The Iraqi official said al-Kurdi is wanted by Iraqi authorities, but refused to give his real name.

He added: 'Our latest information is that he is in Syria fighting in the Kobane area. He is an expert in mountainous areas.

'He is commanding the Kurdish group within Daesh [an Arabic name for ISIS] because he is a Kurd.' 

Reports from inside the city suggest that ISIS troops have already begun beheading civilians in areas they control, meaning the Kurdish fighters are helping in the massacre of their own people.

The U.N. has warned that, as in Sinjar and Mosul, thousands more could be slaughtered if ISIS win full control of Kobane.

Halabja is a predominantly Kurdish town in the north of Iraqi which gained notoriety after Saddam Hussein bombed it with chemical weapons  in 1988, killing some 5,000 people.

Shorsh Hassan, a  spokesman for the People's Protection Units (YPG) in Kobane, said: 'The fighter  from Kobane is not like someone who hails from Chechnya with no idea about tracks and roads.'

YPG officials say they became aware of Kurds among the mostly Sunni Muslim extremists early in the fighting.

As Kurdish fighters were defending the nearby Syrian village of Shiran in September, two Kurdish men with different accents and wearing YPG uniforms infiltrated their ranks, Kurdish officials said. 

They were captured and upon questioning they admitted to fighting for the Islamic State group, the officials added. 

Thousands of militants from all over the world - including north Africans, Asians and Westerners - have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join the ranks of the Islamic State group. 

Turkish nationals are among their number, but it is unknown if any are fighting in Kobane.  

Bloody: The seven-week battle for Kobane has seen extensive airstrikes by America and its coalition partners - including the UK - and is the longest and deadliest battle in Islamic State's campaign so far

Halabja was known as  the home of Abdullah Goran, one of the best-known Kurdish poets in the 20th century, and used to be largely non-religious.

But in the past three decades, radical Muslim preachers have become active there and turned it into one of Iraqi Kurdistan's most conservative areas. 

Kiwan Mohammed, the 25-year-old goalkeeper of Halabja's soccer team, was killed last month  while fighting for the Islamic State group in Kobane - to the shock of many Iraqis.

Mohammed was identified by jihadi websites as Abu Walid al-Kurdi. According to reports, the athlete left Syria in July 2013 and had not been heard of until his death.

Some 70 Iraqi Kurds, mostly from Halabja, went to fight in Syria with the Islamic State group, according to Dana Jalal, a journalist who follows jihadist groups. 

Most go through Turkey where they say they are going for tourism, but they then they cross into Syria, with some taking their families with them.

Nawaf Khalil, the Europe-based spokesman for Syria's powerful Kurdish Democratic Union Party, said Kurdish fighters within the Islamic State group are invaluable in the Kobane battle because they know the geography, the language and the mentality of fellow Kurds.

He said: 'A main part of their work is tapping (electronic surveillance) and intelligence-gathering. They might be also using some from the Kobane area to benefit from the geographical knowledge of the area.'

Mustafa Bali, a Kurdish activist in Kobane, said that by having Kurdish fighters, Islamic State extremists are trying to win the hearts and minds of Syrian Kurds in the area.

He added: 'Daesh is trying to tell the people of Kobane that it does not consider them enemies and its fighters include Kurds.'
