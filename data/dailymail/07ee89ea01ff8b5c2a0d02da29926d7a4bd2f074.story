Friends of a Taiwanese woman pleaded with her not to kill herself as she chatted to them live on Facebook, giving them a running commentary of her own suicide.

But not one of them alerted the authorities as Claire Lin, 31, told them she was inhaling poisonous fumes.

Police in Taipei said her final Facebook entries show her chatting with nine friends, describing her gradual asphyxiation.

Chilling: Claire Lin, 31, used Facebook to chat to nine friends as she inhaled poisonous fumes

One picture posted from her mobile phone shows a charcoal barbecue burning next to two stuffed animals. Another shows the room filled with fumes.

Police officer Hsieh Ku-ming said today that Miss Lin took her own life on her birthday, March 18. Family members reported the suicide soon after her death but were unaware of the online conversations that accompanied it.

One friend, identified as Chung Hsin, told Miss Lin: 'Be calm, open the window, put out the charcoal fire, please, I beg you.'

She replied: 'The fumes are suffocating. They fill my eyes with tears. Don't write me anymore.'

Her last words, written in Chinese, were: 'Too late. My room is filled with fumes. I just posted another picture. Even while I'm dying, I still want FB [Facebook]. Must be FB poison. Haha.'

Miss Lin's chilling messages indicated she was unhappy because her boyfriend was ignoring her, and had failed to return home to be with her on her birthday. He found her body the following morning and alerted her family.

Mr Hsieh said he regretted that none of Miss Lin's friends called the police for help during the 67-minute episode.

But he added: 'It could be true that it would be hard to track down a Facebook friend without her address or phone contact.'

Chai Ben-rei, a sociologist at Taiwan's Feng Chia University, said the incident reflected social isolation in the internet age.

'People may have doubts about what they see on the internet because of its virtual nature, and fail to take action on it,' he said.
