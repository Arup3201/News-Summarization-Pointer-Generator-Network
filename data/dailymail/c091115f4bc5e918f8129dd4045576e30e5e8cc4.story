A married couple from Washington state have been charged with criminal mistreatment and Medicaid fraud after police say they horribly neglected a special-needs girl while collecting money from the state for her care.

When investigators responded to April and Jeffrey Henderson’s home in North Bend, Washington, in October 2012, they were shocked to discover the 19-year-old girl naked except for a dirty diaper sitting in a filthy room permeated with stench.

April Henderson, 33 - who described herself as a ‘chauffeur, chef, housekeeping, nurse, companion' on her Facebook page - had been the girl's full-time caretaker, while her husband, Jeffrey Henderson, 34, had been her legal guardian.

The teenager, who suffers from cerebral palsy and is visually impaired, weighted just 67lbs and appeared 'skeletal,' and she had 23 rotten teeth.

A King County Sheriff’s Office detective described the room where the girl lived as the worst she has ever seen, with soiled clothes scattered about, piles of refuse and dried vomit.

The special-needs girl was sitting in her waste-covered wheelchair and crying for help, according to court documents obtained by Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  

‘The only way to describe her moaning was that of a wounded animal,’ Detective Belinda Paredes-Garrett was quoted as saying.

The rest of the Hendersons’ home was filled with all the trappings of middle-class prosperity, including two flat screen televisions, laptops, iPhones, an iPad, and even a large reptile menagerie.

The couple's ward was orphaned at age 7 and was left in their care. In 2004, Jeffrey Henderson became her legal guardian, and the couple spent the next eight years collecting $4,100 a month in Medicaid funds intended for the girl.

Instead, officials say the husband and wife pocketed all the money, which was their only source of income since neither one of them had a job.

The sheriff's office and the Department of Social and Health Services were asked to check up on the special-needs patient in the Hendersons’ care in October 2012 by staffers at Children's Hospital, who became concerned about her health.

When detectives and a case worker knocked on the family’s door, April Henderson initially tried to prevent them from entering the residence, according to court documents.

Once inside, the investigators were 'taken aback' by the foul smell hanging in the air. Three of the couple's children were home at the time.

When questioned by police, Mrs Henderson explained that they had caught them on a 'bad day.'

According to the charging papers, Mrs Henderson claimed to have spent 350 hours a month looking after the young woman in her care. In return, she was paid $3,500 a month through a government program and another $600 in Social Security benefits.

However, the self-proclaimed nurse could not tell officers how the girl in her care was being fed.

After the emaciated, severely neglected cerebral palsy patient was taken away from the couple, the wife filed for unemployment and received a total of nearly $20,000.

Following her rescue from the couple's home, the neglected teen was placed in the care of a court-appointed guardian; she has since put on more than 30lbs and got 19 root canals to repair her damaged teeth.

The Hendersons, who have been married for more than 13 years, have three sons and a daughter. The family have since moved from North Bend to St Augusta, Florida, where Jeffrey Henderson took a job at a local gym.

The couple's children were taken away from them for a time in 2012, but based on their Facebook pages, the family have since been reunited. Neither April nor Jeffrey have been jailed.
