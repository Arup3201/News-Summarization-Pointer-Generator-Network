The world's most famous disabled piglet, the aptly named Chris P. Bacon, is rearing to get into gear after receiving a custom-built wheelchair.

The little pig, born with deformed hind legs, first shot to fame when his owner, veterinarian Dr Len Lucero from Clermont, Florida, built him a tiny wheelchair from children’s toys to help him move around.

A video of ten-day-old Chris P. has been seen by more than 500,000 people and he has since become a bona fide online celebrity with 17,000 Facebook fans and a Twitter account.

One month later, Chris P. has grown out of his first two wheelchairs, made from K’nex toys, and cannot wait to get into his new device.

Dr Lucero estimates that Mr Bacon will be ready to test-drive his new wheelchair, donated from a company which specialises in devices for handicapped animals, in three weeks’ time.

Chris P. Bacon was born unable to use his hind legs and arrived at Dr Lucerno’s office in mid-January when his owner, one of Dr Lucero’s clients, could not take care of him.

‘It's been a dream, almost not real,’ Dr Lucero told Orlando Sentiel about his piglet’s online fame.

‘He gave a lot of snorts and grunts, and people just ate it up.’

Chris P. has still got some growing to do before he is ready for the new chair, but until then, the piglet hops short distances across Dr Lucero’s office floor.

As soon as he has grown into it the chair will greatly increase his mobility.

The wheelchair attaches to his body with a harness around his neck and his rear end and Chris P. uses his front legs to pull him forward and the wheels of the contraption help him carry his weight.

The wheels raise his rear end to the same height that his back legs would, enabling him to imitate standing.

The celebrity pig has become accustomed to the limelight and tweets his fans several times a day, wishing his 1,250 followers a 'Happy Voinkentines day' and exclaiming 'Next, it will be the pigarazzi following me! OOL! #sqwheel'.
