An army captain believed to be training for the SAS in one of the toughest marches in the British Army has been found dead on a snow-covered mountain in Wales.

It is thought Captain Rob Carnegie was taking part in a gruelling 17-40 mile march in freezing conditions in the Brecon Beacons as part of a selection process for the special forces regiment, when he collapsed and died.

The soldier, in this twenties, was given first aid by army personnel but could not be revived and was declared dead at the scene on Saturday.

His devastated family today paid tribute to the soldier, saying: 'He died doing the job he loved as an officer in the British Army.'

Capt Carnegie was based at the SAS headquarters in Hereford but was from Dublin and was a member of the Royal Signals.

Police are investigating the soldier's death, whose body was found at Corn Du in 
the Welsh mountain range.

A Dyfed Powys Police spokeswoman confirmed that what is being treated as a 'sudden death' was reported at 9.42pm on Saturday.

'We are devastated by the loss of Rob 
who was a loving son, brother and uncle,' his family said in a brief 
statement issued by the Ministry of Defence.

'He died doing the job he loved as an officer in the British Army.'

An Army spokesman added: 'It is with 
great sadness that we can confirm that Capt Rob Carnegie has died in an 
incident in the Brecon Beacons.

'The soldier's family have been informed and are being supported. Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time.

'As is normal in circumstances such as
this, the incident is being investigated and it would be inappropriate 
to comment further.'

Each January soldiers take part in a three-week selection process for the SAS which includes a gruelling 'Test Week'.

They have to complete six marches,
the first five 17 miles long and requiring the soldier to march with a 
30k pack on his back while map reading.

But at the end of the Battle Fitness Test they have to complete the Long Drag a 40-mile march in 20 hours.

There are two selections a year, one in winter and one in summer to put soldiers through temperature extremes.

It was below freezing on the 2,907ft Corn Du peak on Saturday night when the soldier collapsed and died.

It is not known which exercise he was taking part in nor how far into the march he was when he collapsed.

The soldierâ€™s senior officers and colleagues who were taking part in the march are being interviewed by police.

But the investigation is being kept under wraps by the Army because of the sensitive nature of the SAS.

An Army spokesman in Brecon said: 'An investigation is ongoing.'
