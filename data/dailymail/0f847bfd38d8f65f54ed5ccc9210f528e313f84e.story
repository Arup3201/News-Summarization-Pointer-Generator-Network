The ancient Incas were among the first victims of man-made greenhouse gases when Spanish Conquistadors forced them to mine silver at Potosi 240 years before the Industrial Revolution, it was claimed today.

The earliest evidence of large-scale human-produced greenhouse gases in South America was found encased in ice in the Andes.

In the 16th century during its conquest of South America the Spanish forced Incas to work in the mountaintop mines of Potosí in what is now Bolivia - then the largest source of silver in the world.

The earliest evidence of large-scale human-produced greenhouse gases in South America was found encased in ice in the Andes.

The samples were cut from ice that formed over 1,200 years ago as snow settled on the Peruvian Andes. 

Layer by layer it captured chemicals from the air during wet and dry seasons for all those years. 

The indigenous population already knew how to refine the metal but in 1572 the Spanish introduced a new technology that boosted production many times over and sent thick clouds of lead dust rising over the Andes for the first time in history.

Winds carried some of that pollution 500 miles northwest into Peru where tiny remnants of it settled on the Quelccaya Ice Cap.

There it stayed - buried under hundreds of years of snow and ice - until researchers from Ohio State University found it in 2003.

Now in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences they report the discovery of a layer within an ice core that dates to the Spanish conquest, contains bits of lead and bears the chemical signature of the silver mines of Potosí.

The core makes Quelccaya one of only a few select sites on the planet where the pre-industrial human impact on air quality can be studied today.

Dr Paolo Gabrielli said: 'This evidence supports the idea human impact on the environment was widespread even before the industrial revolution.'

Prof Lonnie Thompson said the find is 'another keyhole into the past of human activity in that part of the world' and believes further investigation could help us better understand the fate of pollution circulating in the atmosphere today.

The samples were cut from ice that formed over 1,200 years ago as snow settled on the Peruvian Andes. Layer by layer it captured chemicals from the air during wet and dry seasons for all those years.

The researchers found a spike in bismuth - a chemical by-product of mining metals - around 148O when the Inca Empire was expanding.

And around 154O less than a decade after the beginning of Spanish colonisation in South America trace element concentrations of several metals - including lead- rose.

The refining process the Spanish introduced involved grinding silver ore - which contains much more lead than silver - into powder before mixing it with mercury in a process called amalgamation.

So atmospheric pollution from silver production would chiefly contain traces of lead particulates.

While the Incas had long extracted silver, a new processing method introduced by the Spanish in 1572 greatly increased production even as it belched lead dust and other pollutants into the atmosphere. 

The pollution blew over the entire region, including the Quelccaya Ice Cap some 500 miles (800 km) northwest in southern Peru.

The Spanish refining process involved pulverizing silver ore, containing both lead and silver, into powder, which sent metallic dust into the atmosphere. 

The powder was mixed with mercury. 

The silver was separated by heating the mixture to allow the mercury to evaporate. 

Starting just before 16OO the Quelccaya ice began capturing much larger quantities of these elements - and the high amounts persisted until the early 18OOs when South American countries declared independence from Spain.

To pin down where the pollution came from the researchers compared their data with those from a peat bog in Chile and from sedimentary lake records from regions including Potosí and other mines throughout Bolivia and Peru.

These latter sites would have captured the pollution generated in their local area during that time.

The chemical signatures in the Quelccaya ice suggests most of the pollution likely came from Potosi - where the Spanish produced the vast majority of silver.

Even in their highest concentrations, the elements entrapped in the ice are not visible to the naked eye and can be detected only through chemical analyses. 

The section of core containing them has the translucent white appearance of perfectly clean ice.

Dr Gabrielli said: 'The fact we can detect pollution in ice from a pristine high altitude location is indicative of the continental significance of this deposition. Only a significant source of pollution could travel so far, and affect the chemistry of the snow on a remote place like Quelccaya.'

Ice cores in Greenland contain traces of lead from as far back as the 5th century BC which were sent airborne by smelting in the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations.

This latest ice core from Quelccaya shows that humans generated substantial pollution in the 16th century. Still the 2Oth century produced more pollution than any other time in human history.

International geological governing bodies are currently considering whether to officially call our current epoch the Anthropocene, or 'Age of Humans,' to designate the span of time that humans have been changing the environment.

The researchers hope the Quelccaya core will inform that debate.
