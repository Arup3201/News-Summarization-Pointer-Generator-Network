It might be almost 80 miles away from their former home in High Wycombe, but that didn't stop supporters turning up in their droves to watch Wasps take on London Irish at the Ricoh Arena on Sunday.

The Premiership side have relocated to Coventry in order to boost attendances and increase matchday revenue, despite complaints from London-based fans.

But even if some decided to stay at home for Wasps' first game at their new stadium, there was still a bumper crowd in place to welcome Dai Young's side.

Wasps players warm-up ahead of their first home match at the Ricoh Arena

With black-and-yellow flags left on every seat, flame cannons set up along one touchline and an attendance more than four times greater than the club were used to at Adams Park, Wasps' players were treated to an electric atmosphere ahead of their Aviva Premiership clash.

Despite the advantages the Ricoh will bring, scrum-half Joe Simpson insists Wasps' move will not be a quick fix for their Premiership hopes.

Going into Sunday's game Wasps are seventh in the table, having won four and lost five this season and have not won the title since 2008.

But Simpson does not expect instant rewards from their new home after leaving Adams Park.

'There's no miracle cure. It'll be hard to see the benefits short-term this season but we are going to have options open to us in the future. The move is for the long-term future and securing it for Wasps. 

'It's not a short-term fix and it's not going to mean we win an extra match here and there but the benefits for next season and the one after - and for years to come - will be seen when we're generating more income.

'It's a long-term fix and we cannot forget that we were only a couple of hours away from going bankrupt and this move has secured the future.'
