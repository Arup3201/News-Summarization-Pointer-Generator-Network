Forget La Masia, welcome to La Moyesia. David Moyes might not be at one of the world’s biggest clubs anymore but he has moved to the one with the sixth-best youth academy in Europe. 

He made his name at Everton for developing young talent and according to The International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) there are only five better youth systems in Europe than Real Sociedad’s talent factory at ‘Zubieta’. 

Here Sportmail looks at the famed academy; at three of the players Moyes now inherits; and at three of its all-time greats.

THREE FROM THE PAST

Xabi Alonso

The Bayern Munich midfielder’s father Periko Alonso also came through the club’s youth system although by the time Zubieta’s current seven pitch facility was built in 1982 he was already in the first team helping the side win the league. Like father like son, Xabi and his brother Mikel learned their trade in the youth categories of Real Sociedad. 

Xabi almost emulated his father’s title win but the team finished second in 2003 and he left for Liverpool at the end of the following season. He went on to win the European Cup twice as well as the World Cup and the European Championship. Adored by fans of La Real they still hope he will choose to finish his career at Anoeta when his German adventure comes to an end.

Luis Arconada

Northern Ireland fans will remember Arconada best for palming Billy Hamilton’s cross straight into the path of Gerry Armstrong who scored to give them their greatest ever World Cup finals result. That shock, in the 1982 World Cup, was all the bigger for having come against one of the best goalkeepers in the world at the time. Arconada came through the Zubieta academy and played in both of Real Sociedad’s League winning campaigns in 81 and 82. 

He was the keeper who conceded fewest goals in La Liga for three seasons running from 1980 to 1982 and won 68 caps for his country appearing in two World Cups and two European Championships. He also played 551 games for Real Sociedad. His son, also called Luis, works in the media department of the club and helped David Moyes through his first few days in San Sebastian last week.

Antoine Griezmann

The latest gem to come from Zubieta left last summer moving to Atletico Madrid for a record £23.8million fee. After a superb season at Anoeta and a fine World Cup for France the young French-Basque winger could no longer be expected to play his football outside of the Champions League and Real Sociedad cashed in.

Griezmann was signed aged 13 after the club’s chief scout in France Eric Olhats spotted him and managed to make him switch to Spain before Lyon could grab him. He was at Zubieta for five years before he made it to La Real’s B-team and then, in 2009, he debuted in the first team. Last season he scored 20 goals in 50 games and carried the team through what was a troubled campaign before he became the club’s most expensive transfer ever.

Moyes’s Masia

CIES ranked Zubieta sixth in the world in 2014 according to the number of homegrown players at the club or currently playing at another big-5 club. Barcelona came out on top with Manchester United and Real Madrid in second and third. But after Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain, Real Sociedad came in alongside Basque cousins Athletic Bilbao. 

The latter have maintained their Basque-only player policy so their place in the list is not unexpected but Real Sociead remain in the top six despite allowing foreign players since 1989. Real Sociedad have 15 players in their own squad that are homegrown and nine who are currently plying their trade in another big club in Europe.

THREE FOR THE FUTURE

Pablo Hervías

At just 21 Pablo Hervías is one of the gems of Zubieta and he showed what confidence he has last April when he made his first team debut and tried to lob Espanyol keeper Kiko Casilla with practically his first touch in La Liga. The effort went wide but his 16-minute cameo was enough to convince Real Sociedad fans that he can push on this season.

His chances have been few and far between so far as previous manager Jagoba Arasate preferred more experienced players as he clung to his job but he did give him another chance coming off the bench against Getafe and he responded with an 82nd minute goal only for Real Sociedad to then concede twice in injury time and lose the game. 

Comfortable on the right of the three behind the striker or playing off the left wing and shooting off of his favoured right foot he had both Real Madrid and Barcelona watching him last season and looks ready to give Moyes the dynamism he will want from his team. He is also not the only flying winger Moyes can call upon from the Real Sociedad B-team. Alain Oyarzun is also just 21 and only just behind Hervías in terms of development.

Ruben Pardo

No-one has excited locals watching the young talents at Zubieta in recent years as much as Pardo who Real Madrid bid £8m for before he had even made his first team debut. Pardo won the Under-19 European Championship with Spain and looked set to become the lynchpin in Sociedad’s midfield for years to come.

Aged 22 he is still yet to fulfil that enormous potential but the club showed they continue to believe in him last season when they extended his deal to 2018 and kept his £23.8m buy-out clause. He also has a special ‘anti-Athletic Bilbao’ clause set at 60m preventing the neighbours from pinching the current Spain Under-21 international. He might need to toughen up to fit Moyes’ profile of the perfect central midfielder but thanks to years on the training pitches of Zubieta all the technical qualities are in place.

Joseba Zaldua

The 22-year-old right back started out as an attacking midfielder when he joined the club as a 14-year-old. He still carries a threat striding forward but has turned himself into a compact and reliable right-back. He is another who the club have tied to a contract that takes him up to 2018 and he has started nine games this season. 

There were suggestions in the summer that when Real Sociedad finally made their loan deal for the former Arsenal forward Carlos Vela permanent, Arsene Wenger asked after the possibility of including the young defender in the transfer. Ultimately Real Sociedad resisted, seeing the full-back as integral to the future of their defence.
