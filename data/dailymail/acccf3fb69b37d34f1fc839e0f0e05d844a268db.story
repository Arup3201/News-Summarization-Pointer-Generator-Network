Manchester United defender Reece James is wanted by Fulham, Sheffield Wednesday and Huddersfield.

The 21-year-old signed a contract extension with United last month after impressing Louis van Gaal but the Old Trafford club will consider whether to let him out to gain more game time and experience. 

Reece James has impressed Louis van Gaal but could be sent out on loan by Manchester United 

James, 21, has already been sent on loan to Rotherham this season, but could be set for another move

James had a loan spell at Rotherham between November and January and has made one appearance for United this season in their ill-fated Capital One Cup defeat to MK Dons at the start of the season. 

The Championship trio are keen to add James's pace to their ranks as they look to finish the season with a flourish and, in Fulham's case, ensure they stay up.
