Tweeting in 5... 4... 3...: Cmdr Chris Hadfield is posting on Twitter before his trip to the ISS

When astronaut Chris Hadfield blasts off to take his role as commander of the ISS space station at the end of the year, many eyes will be watching.

For Cmdr Hadfield is building up a legion of fans on Twitter, as he relays all the details - from the mundane to the magical - about life as an astronaut.

The 52-year-old Canadian, who served with the Canadian Forces before moving to NASA in 1992, fills his followers in on all the details as he prepares for a trip - his second to the ISS.

Sometimes he is sharing pictures from his training, sometimes he is telling wannabe astronauts what they need to do if they ever want to space-walk.

Other times he is answering questions on the role of robots in space, or whether you can listen to music as you float above the atmosphere.

Sometimes he is explaining how to deal with the delicate situation when you need to take a call of nature in a place where Mother Nature has yet to venture.

Asked his opinion on the shuttle Soyuz, which has just delivered another batch of astronauts to the ISS, Christ tells us, in the typical Twitter short-form, that the ship is: 'Rugged, built on experience, it is not delicate. I trust it with my life.

One user asks why astronauts carry pencils, to which Chris replies: 'pencils work in all attitudes and pressures, good in the cockpit.'

One user asks Chris: 'Dumb pilot question: do you do anything that resembles a "DI", and sign out the "logbook" before you get in to go?'

Chris replied: 'we do 2 full checks of the cockpit and interior. The rocket you just have to trust.'

Despite all the preparations, Chris still gets some time off though: Twitter user Phil Reilly ‏ asked: 'Hi Cmdr. Did you watch Astro Mike on The Big Bang Theory?'

Chris replied: 'Not yet, but we recorded it to watch later. I went to see The Avengers with friends instead :)'

Chris also shares pictures, such as 'my first flight suit' - an Air Cadet glider pilot uniform from around 1975 - in Chris's 'pre-moustache' days.

On to important questions. One users asks: 'How do you scratch an itch in a spacesuit? Drive you crazy?'.

Sadly, the NASA geniuses have not solved that crisis: The reply is: 'you have to rub itches against the suit'.

As Chris posts a picture of his underwear, pants and jacket, while dressing for an underwater 'space-walk', someone asks: 'I hear...uh yall haven't solved the bathroom problem in those...', Chris replies: 'We wear an 'absorbent garment' underneath...'

User @emmgryner asks: '[Musician] Jack White wants to play vinyl in space. I surmise @Cmdr_Hadfield has already done this.'

Chris replies: 'vinyl, no. Cassette tapes and mp3s, yes!'

And, that inevitable question, 'in space, can nobody hear you screa...' - wait, actually it was: 'I've often wondered... In space, does nobody eat ice cream?'

The answer to that is 'yes we occasionally do when a cold freezer is launched on a visiting vehicle. The dried ice cream - no.'

Another user asks: 'In 140 characters: Why send people and not just robots? I'm solidly in the people camp, but am interested in your answer.'

Chris gives the poetic answer: 'We need both; robots to do specific tasks, and people to plot, replan, notice, understand, rejoice, share and wonder.'

Sara LaPier asks: 'Why were you chosen as an astronaut?'

Chris says the qualifications include: 'advanced education, physical fitness, operational work experience, plus other skills (SCUBA, language, music, speaking)'

And while there are many more questions and answers on Chris's Twitter pagfe, the final words must go to user Carolyn ‏.

She says: 'Just a "glad you post this stuff." So great to see insider astronaut stuff.'

Chris replies with a quick: 'Thanks!', and then goes back to living the dream life that most young boys can only dream about.
