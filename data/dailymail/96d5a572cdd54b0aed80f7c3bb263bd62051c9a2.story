Two Polish computer hackers who launched a cyber-attack on one of the biggest online casinos in an attempt to blackmail the owner have been jailed.

Piotr Smirnow, 31, and Patryk Surmacki, 35, ordered the Manchester-based boss of the gambling site to give them a 50 per cent share of the company, worth an estimated £30m, or else they would 'take down' the online casino's servers, effectively stopping the website from operating.

Manchester Crown Court was told the pair then launched their devastating four-day attack with the help of a hacker in the US.

They pleaded guilty to two offences each of blackmail and one offence of unauthorised acts on computers.

In the first prosecution of its kind, both men were sentenced yesterday to five years and four months in prison.

Judge Michael Henshall said he did not accept that Smirnow and Surmacki were 'bungling' and said their crimes involved 'careful planning'.

He said: 'It is important that a message is sent to people that commit attacks such as this that there will be sentences that are considerable.'

Greater Manchester Police have said the Manchester-based victim had known Smirnow and Surmacki for four years prior to the scam.

Smirnow contacted the victim on July 23 and asked to meet him as he had a business proposition.

The victim initially declined but Smirnow persuaded him to meet both of him and Surmacki at Heathrow Airport Terminal 5.

The Polish pair demanded a 50 per cent share in the company and told him they intended to crash the server and 'take it down'.

Smirnow and Surmacki said they knew a notorious computer hacker and they fully intended to perform a DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack on the company servers.

'They behaved like a couple of sinister 
playground bullies who thought they could use the threat of financial 
annihilation to extort compliance from these companies' 

- Detective Inspector Chris Mossop, of the Serious Crime Division

The victim started to record the meeting on his mobile and agreed to meet the hacker, in order to buy his company time.

The victim then reported the threats to the police.

On August 2, Smirnow and Surmacki carried out their threat and unleashed the DDOS attack, which resulted in the company’s servers going down and prevented any customers from using the site for five hours. It cost the company around £15,000.

The court was told they attacked the firm because they believed it would be a 'big hit' and would 'make a lot of noise' in the world of online casinos and they wanted to show they 'could not be pushed around'.

They also tried to blackmail the boss of a US-based gaming platform that enables more than 100 online casinos worldwide to function. The pair were arrested at a plush hotel at Heathrow Airport after being secretly recorded in an elaborate sting operation by Greater Manchester Police.

Tim Greenald, prosecuting, said: 'The essence of the blackmail was very much that of a protection racket of yesteryear.'

During the meeting at Heathrow they were filmed telling the boss of the US-based gaming platform they were 'ready to go and do crazy things' and that they would 'go to war'.

The court was told a week-long attack on the US firm would have caused it to lose an estimated $600,000.

It is claimed the pair launched their blackmail because they wanted to get back at a former business partner with whom they had fallen out.

Richard Wormald, defending, said Smirnow and Surmacki had entered the 'murky world' of online gambling sites and had 'gotten out of their depth'.

He said the blackmail was 'ludicrous' and 'ridiculous'.

Detective Inspector Chris Mossop, of the Serious Crime Division, said: 'This was a very complex, dynamic investigation that centred on an emerging global cyber-threat.

'Denial of service attacks have become increasingly common offences in recent years and can have a devastating effect on the victim’s online business.

'With millions of pounds and potentially dozens of jobs involved, Smirnow and Surmacki were playing for incredibly high stakes and clearly knew what they were doing.

'They used their intimate, expert knowledge of online business to attempt to bully the victims into submission. But make no mistake, they may have been using the latest technology, but this was simply good old-fashioned blackmail.

'They behaved like a couple of sinister playground bullies who thought they could use the threat of financial annihilation to extort compliance from these companies.

'But their greed was ultimately their downfall as they failed to reckon with the victims’ bravery in the face of extreme intimidation.

'The moment our officers arrested them will no doubt live long in their memories as it as at that point they must have realised the game was up.'

The Manchester victim welcomed the sentence.

He said: 'I am grateful for the assistance to me provided by the police in this matter.

'This case made me fear for my personal safety as well as for the future of my business, which is why I felt compelled to take action against the perpetrators of this crime.

'No one should have to succumb to blackmail and this sentence should act as a warning to those involved in cyber-extortion that the police and the courts will view this type of conduct very seriously.'
