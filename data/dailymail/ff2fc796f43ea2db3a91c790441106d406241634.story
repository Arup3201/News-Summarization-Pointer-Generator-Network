The estranged partner of the woman who killed both their sons and leapt 100ft to her death on Dartmoor is awaiting trial for assaulting her, it emerged yesterday.

Neil Patterson, 52, is on bail following the alleged assault three months ago. His address was given as the home he had been sharing until then with Katherine Hooper and their two sons, Josh, five, and two-year-old Sam.

Neighbours said he was due to go on trial in the next few weeks – which was causing concern for Miss Hooper, who went missing the day after the alleged assault on April 28, prompting a full-scale helicopter search.

Charges: Neil Patterson, 52, is due to appear in court next month for a trial over an alleged assault against partner Katherine Hooper, 24, who killed herself and her two children on Friday

At the time, police described her as ‘a high-risk vulnerable person’. She was found the following morning unconscious and face down in a field.

The children were taken into temporary foster care for several weeks while she recovered.

Neighbours said that Miss Hooper broke up with long-term partner Patterson after the  incident.

On Friday, day-trippers watched in horror as 24-year-old Miss Hooper put Josh on her back and jumped off the rocks at Haytor.

Sam’s body was subsequently found at her terraced house  20 miles away in Paignton.

A serious case review has now been announced into the care given to the vulnerable mother and her children.

She and her children were known to the social workers and had previously been the subject of ‘intervention’. The serious case review will look into whether more could have been done to protect the children.

Killed: Joshua, five, (left) died after falling 100ft from the Dartmoor beauty spot, while a body thought to be that of Sam, two, (right) was found at Mrs Hooper's home in Paignton

Dartmoor: Police stood guard near the spot where the pair tragically plunged to their deaths

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall 
police said: ‘Police investigating the tragic deaths of Katherine Hooper
and her two sons Josh Patterson and Sam Patterson have confirmed that 
the family were subject of Safeguarding Partnership intervention prior 
to their untimely deaths.

‘The investigation will now be referred to a serious case review process as per national good  practice.’

The Safeguarding Partnership – of 
council, NHS and police – is alerted when someone needs community care, 
for example, because of abuse or mental illness. Serious case reviews 
take place when a child dies and there are signs of abuse or neglect.

Neighbour Janette Nolan, 53, said: ‘I 
think social services are partly to blame. They should have been looking
after her rather than scrutinising her the whole time. She recently 
told me it was like they were waiting for her to slip up so they could 
take the kids away.

‘She was a lovely lady, she was innocent, caring, kind but seemed vulnerable and lost.

Found dead: Katharine Hooper, who went by the name of Kat, and her son Samuel both died on Friday

Investigation: Police are treating the deaths as murders but are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident

Sons: Joshua, five, (left) and Samuel, two, (right) are both believed to have been killed by their mother

Search: Police outside the Paignton home of Katharine Hooper where the body of a two-year-old boy was found

‘I think she was frightened of her 
future and of being a single parent, but you would have never have 
guessed  she would ever have done  anything like this.

‘They were lovely, lovely boys. Josh was just smashing.’

Katherine had lost her job at a local hotel around the time her relationship broke down.

In a statement about the tragedy Mr 
Patterson said: ‘On the Friday evening I heard the devastating news that
the three most important and cherished people in my life had been taken
from me.

‘I would gratefully appreciate for me and my family to be left alone to grieve in peace.'

999 call: Emergency services rushed to Haytor on Dartmoor, but could not save Mrs Hooper and Joshua

Tragedy: The body of a two-year-old body was found at Katharine Hooper's home in Paignton hours after she and her son Joshua died at Haytor, Dartmoor

Haytor, a steep granite tor, is 
considered Dartmoor’s most famous site and is popular with coach 
parties, walkers and sightseers.

During the 19th century steps were 
cut into one side of the tor and a metal handrail fixed to allow 
tourists easier access to the summit.

At its highest point it reaches 
1,499ft (457 metres) above sea level, providing panoramic views of the 
south coast, the Teign Estuary and the rolling countryside.

Mike Nendick, from the Dartmoor 
National Park Authority, said there had been accidents  at Haytor before
but they were ‘not commonplace’.

‘When you have an attractive 
landscape, whether it’s on the coast or moors, it attracts people. 
There’s always the potential for accidents,’ he added.

‘It wouldn’t be appropriate to comment
on the accident. But we would urge members of the public to wear 
sensible footwear and consider weather conditions.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
