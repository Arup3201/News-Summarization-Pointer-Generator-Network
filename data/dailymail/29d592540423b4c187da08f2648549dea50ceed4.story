John Bercow is to fly out on a £6,000 taxpayer-funded trip to Australia, where he is expected to have secret talks with his controversial choice as the new Commons chief.

The disclosure came as the Commons Speaker faced a growing all-party revolt over his plan to appoint Australian parliament official Carol Mills as the £200,000-a-year Commons Clerk, responsible for vital constitutional matters.

Defiant Mr Bercow will have crisis talks with Commons Leader William Hague tomorrow after returning from holiday in Turkey, then make an emergency statement to Parliament on the issue.

Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercowis at the centre of an increasing row over his determination to appoint an Australian to the important post of Commons Clerk

He is expected to fly to Australia in the middle of next month.

Senior MPs claim Mrs Mills, dubbed ‘the Canberra caterer’ because her responsibilities at the Australian senate include managing kitchens and cleaning, is too inexperienced, and say Mr Bercow plans to use her appointment to grab more power for himself.

He has been warned by close allies that he could be ejected from the Speaker’s chair if he refuses to back down and scrap the proposal.

Mrs Mills has made it clear that she has no intention of withdrawing from her proposed £200,000-a-year job

Well-placed sources say Mrs Mills has made it clear that she has no intention of withdrawing from her proposed job.

MPs have backed a demand by Tory grandee Bernard Jenkin, the chairman of the powerful Public Administration Committee, to quiz Mrs Mills before her appointment is approved by No 10 and Buckingham Palace.

Initially, Mr Bercow dismissed the revolt as the latest attempt by his Tory critics to unseat him.

But the rebels have gained strong support from senior Labour figures including Jack Straw, Margaret Beckett, David Blunkett and Natascha Engel, the chairman of the influential Backbench Business Committee, as well as Lib Dem elder statesman Sir Alan Beith and former Speaker Baroness Boothroyd.

Equally damaging, it is understood all three Deputy Speakers – Labour’s Lindsay Hoyle and Dawn Primarolo and Tory Eleanor Laing – are against Mrs Mills’s appointment. Mr Bercow has tried to defuse the row by suggesting the Commons Clerk’s job be split, with Mrs Mills becoming chief executive in a managerial role, and the Clerk’s job handed to a parliamentary expert.

But critics have said he has no right to change the Clerk’s job without MPs’ permission – and say the extra £200,000-a-year salary would be a waste of public money. A spokesman for the Speaker tried to play down the row saying: ‘The Speaker is keen to listen to the views of MPs.’

She said his visit to Australia was planned a year ago and that Commonwealth visits to meet other Speakers were ‘an important element’ of his job. He will be accompanied by an aide.

Think again, Mr Speaker. Your Aussie is patently not up to it says JESSE NORMAN, Tory MP

A disagreement over a new Clerk of the House of Commons? You might think politics doesn’t get any more petty or irrelevant than that. What could matter less when there is so much sickness and suffering in the world today?

You would be wrong.

The role of the Clerk dates back to the 14th Century and combines two crucial functions.

The Clerk is, first and foremost, the principal constitutional and procedural adviser to the House of Commons, available to be consulted by any MP on any such matter, great or small.

Parliamentary procedure is very complex; issues in the Commons often require an immediate decision, and such decisions affect everything from the air we breathe to peace and war. So it is obviously vital for MPs to have authoritative advice right on hand.

As Parliament has expanded, so too has the Clerk’s job. Today the Clerk has a Management Board which runs an organisation of some 2,000 people, with a budget of £245 million.

But the constitutional role is primary. Sometimes the Clerk’s advice is unpalatable to governments or to Speakers, and so the Clerkship is protected by letters patent from the Monarch. Only Parliament itself can remove a Clerk.

Ten days ago it became clear that a panel chaired by the Speaker, John Bercow, was proposing as a new Clerk someone who was patently not qualified for the job. The candidate, Carol Mills, is a senior official in the Australian Parliament. She may be an extremely effective administrator, but she has little or no expertise in British constitutional law and procedure. In the delicate words of Dr Rosemary Laing, the Clerk of the Australian Senate, ‘Carol comes from the state public service. It is not simple to move to serving Parliament if there is a lack of understanding of Parliament’.

Yet the letter of nomination for Mrs Mills had already gone to Downing Street. Without rapid action it would be forwarded to Buckingham Palace, and approval would automatically follow.

Last Wednesday I submitted a motion requiring MPs to be given the opportunity to scrutinise the appointment, co-sponsored by the Labour MP Natascha Engel.

It has been signed by 84 MPs from across the political spectrum, including three former foreign secretaries, a former deputy leader of the Labour Party and six former ministers.

It is framed in simple, neutral language: ‘The recommendation of Ms Carol Mills to be Clerk of this House should be subject to, and contingent upon, a pre-appointment hearing and report by a select committee.’

The motion was designed to be non-partisan, yet the reaction has been highly surprising.

So far there has not been any indication that Parliament will be given a say on this matter. Nor has the appointment of Ms Mills been withdrawn.

Instead, it has been proposed that the role of Clerk should be split and a new Chief Executive (presumably Mrs Mills) be appointed as well.

This effectively concedes that Mrs Mills is not qualified to be Clerk. But instead of dropping her and starting again, it puts the cart before the horse and proposes an on-the-hoof restructuring of the House, all, it seems, in order to accommodate her appointment.

Not only that – it proposes a new role of Chief Executive at a probable cost of £150,000-£200,000.

But the issues go beyond Mrs Mills herself, or the creation of a Chief Executive role. The whole appointment process has been seriously flawed.

Key people, such as the Deputy Speaker, Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle, were not included. The process was delayed by internal disagreements, and but for the intervention of MPs last week, would have been completed when MPs were on holiday.

Headhunters were used for the first time – doubtless at some cost – yet selected a candidate who did not even meet the basic job description set out in the original advertisement.

And it is far from clear how they could have recommended a candidate who was, and remains, under investigation in Australia for maladministration.

But there is still a deeper issue. Mr Bercow was elected after his predecessor Michael Martin lost a vote of no confidence – an extraordinarily rare and damaging event for the Speaker.

If it is allowed to drag on, the appointment of Ms Mills has the potential to cause new damage to the office of Speaker, and so to the House of Commons.

Tomorrow Mr Bercow is to make a statement in the Commons on this issue.

We must hope he will move swiftly to end that appointment, reaffirm the importance of due process in the selection of public officials, and put the wider issue of the Clerkship before a special committee elected by MPs.
