Chubby Checker has filed a £320million lawsuit against Hewlett-Packard over a mobile phone app which bears his name

It was a risque but light-hearted app that claimed to let ladies know what they can expect from a new man based on the size of his feet.

But though it promised ‘no need for disappointment or surprise’, someone’s been left thoroughly unamused by the ‘Chubby Checker’ – the singer whose name it borrows.

Now the 1960s' rock ’n’ roll star who’s famed for The Twist has filed a $500million lawsuit in the US against technology firm Hewlett-Packard, through whose software the app was available.

Lawyers for the singer – whose real name is Ernest Evans – claim the app developed by a company called Magic Apps, has done ‘irreparable damage’ to their client by associating the Checker name with ‘sexual connotation’.

They said: 'Purchasers of "the Chubby Checker" app and 
non-purchasing browsers of the associated web page are being misled into
believing that plaintiffs have endorsed defendant's app.'

The suit adds that the app ‘tarnishes’ the stage name which Evans trademarked in 1997.

The application for Hewlett-Packard's Palm OS platform boasted: 'Any of you ladies out there just start seeing 
someone new and wondering what the size of their member is?

'All you need
to do is find out the man’s shoe size and plug it in... Now with the 
Chubby Checker there is no need for disappointment or surprise...”

The House of Palm software website shows that the $0.99 app was downloaded just 84 times.

Willie Gary, Checker's lawyer said: 'We cannot sit idly and watch as technology giants or anyone else exploits the name or likeness of an innocent person with the goal of making millions of dollars.

Ernest Evans, otherwise known as Chubby Checker, pictured left with DeLee Lively in 1996, filed the lawsuit on the basis that the app 'tarnishes' the stage name which Evans trademarked in 1997

'The Defendants have marketed Chubby Checkers' name on their product to gain a profit and this just isn't right.'

Ernest Evans was born in 1941 in 
Spring Gulley, South Carolina, but grew up in South Philadelphia, where 
he lived with his parents and two brothers.

In June of 1959 he recorded a cover 
of Hank Ballard's R&B hit 'The Twist' and 14 months later, in 
the summer of 1960, it was a sensation.

The official Chubby Checker website 
says: 'The Twist' was not only the #1 song but it introduced the concept
of 'dancing apart to the beat'.

'Over the next few years, endless songs 
incorporating 'The Twist' into its name sprang up such as 'Peppermint 
Twist', 'Twist and Shout' and 'Twistin' the Night Away'.

'In addition, 
each new song brought a new dance involving 'dancing apart to the beat' 
such as The Jerk, The Hully Gully, The Boogaloo and The Shake. 
At the forefront was Chubby with The Fly, The Pony and The 
Hucklebuck.'
