Steve Harmison is used to spending his winters on tour in the tropical climes of Antigua or Australia, but on Tuesday night he was instead at home sweet home getting off to the perfect start as manager of Ashington AFC  with a 1-0 win over Bishop Auckland.

Born in the town, Harmison played for the Woodhorn Lane club until 1996 before he decided to focus on a cricketing career that ended with 226 wickets in 63 Tests for England.

But wearing the non-league club's jacket on top of a grey jumper, the former towering fast bowler took his seat in the dugout to lead his side to their first victory in six games and marched into the Northern League Challenge Cup quarter finals.

The towering quick led his hometown club to victory over Bishop Auckland at Woodhorn Lane

Harmison was vocal in the dugout throughout the match as he provided encouragement for his team

'I loved being back in the dressing room,' he said. 'But nobody outside of Ashington knew how threadbare we were today.

'But after tonight, going into the next few weeks, if we can do what we did out there today with a few players coming back, we'll be confident for the rest of the season.'

Glen Taylor's header from Tony Stephenson's cross broke the deadlock 10 minutes after the break on a chilly night at Woodhorn Lane.

Marc Walton could have put Harmison's side ahead after 15 minutes, but his penalty was saved by The Bishops' keeper Stephen Richardson.

Never one to back down from a tough situation in a Three Lions shirt, Harmison was vocal with his players throughout the match, a fixture in his technical area spurring them on with encouragement.  

'We tried to install some belief into the players. But I always knew I had some good solid characters in the side who could stand up and lead from the front,' he said.

It was Harmison's side who had the best of the chances in a scrappy first half. Striker Walton could have put The Colliers ahead after four minutes, but his shot drifted over the bar from close range.

Walton then had a chance to put the home side ahead after winger Tony Stephenson was pulled down in the box, leaving referee Will Finnie had no choice but to point to the spot.

Walton stepped up but saw his effort comfortably saved by Richardson diving to his right.

On a bobbly pitch, both sides struggled to string passes together and employed the long ball option regularly but the home ground advantage and support from the 'Harmy Army' gave were regularly in chorus as they tried to spur the home side to a first win in six.

And the home side almost did break the deadlock when Kyle Downey was inches away from latching onto Phil Airey's low cross.

The visitors had their share of chances too in the first period. Striker Andrew Johnson had their best chance, but his effort was quickly stopped by Ashington keeper Connor Grant.

And they began well in the second half. John Butler had a great opportunity to put the visitors ahead, but his shot drifted wide of the upright.

But it was Harmison's men who went ahead 10 minutes after the restart. Stephenson's right-wing cross was met by the head of Taylor from six yards.

The Two Blues continued to press in search of an equaliser, but they couldn't find a way through as the Ashington defence stood firm.

Butler came close to latching on to a through-ball but Grant was quickly out again to stop the danger.

The home side could have had a second, but Walton's luck in front of goal didn't get any better. He first couldn't convert a rebound from a tight angle after Kyle Oliver's long range drive. And then he couldn't latch onto Taylor's cross from the right.

The visitors continued to try and force the game into extra time, and had a glorious chance when Kyle Davis shot wide from a late corner.

The majority of the 280 fans inside Woodhorn Lane would have been pleased to see a win, while  Harmison will now focus his attentions on the league, with his side hosting Sunderland RCA in a vital relegation six-pointer on Saturday.

He said: 'I think as a football club we've conducted ourselves very well with the media attention. We haven't gone and chased extra publicity or anything like that.

'But when the media have gone by next week, we'll continue and take some confidence after tonight.'
