David Beckham's rippling abs, Cristiano Ronaldo's toned legs and David Gandy's chiselled jaw may sound like attributes of the  perfect man but, if the latest research is anything to go by, they're far from it.

The major discrepancy between what men think women want and what women actually want has been brought to life after extensive research into body confidence.

The research shows that 62 per cent of men still believe that women prefer the gladiator look - and suffer pangs of anxiety when they fail to match up to this image. 

The perfect man? Prince Harry's cheeky smile, comedian James Corden's hair, and Take Me Out host Paddy McGuinness' arms are all attributes of the ideal husband. Women also seek a stomach like rugby star Ben Cohen's and legs like Jonathan Ross'

While men state that a woman’s ideal man would be made up of Justin Bieber’s hair, Gerard Butler’s chiselled face, Hugh Jackman’s movie-star arms, David Gandy’s tight abs and Cristiano Ronaldo’s smooth legs, the response from women showed a contrasting view.

While generic hunks will always catch the eye, many women regard them as bad bets in the long run and prefer a more down-to-earth look, which includes legs like Jonathan Ross', left

The research also revealed that the most successful relationships had been made with a 'boy next door'. 

A spokesperson for Jacamo, who commissioned the research, said: 'Women tell us that men with ordinary bodies are seen as good family makers who pay more attention to their partners than they do to themselves. 

'While hunks will always catch the eye, many women regard them as bad bets in the long run because they may be self-obsessed and more concerned with their own looks and needs rather than anyone else.'
