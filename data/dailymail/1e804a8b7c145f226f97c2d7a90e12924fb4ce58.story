Former Prime Minister Paul Keating has suggested a solution for young people who can’t afford their own home – to allow them to access their superannuation earlier.

The 70-year-old one-time Labor party leader, said a shortage in financial help and houses available for first-time buyers was a position 'we cannot persist with'.

Speaking at property investment company MaxCap Group’s Developers and Dealers Forum last week, Mr Keating said we are in a situation ‘where our children cannot afford to house themselves’.

Offering up superannuation funds as a solution, he said: ‘Superannuation funds will have to do things in the spaces traditionally left to banks, such as property development, and we will see a shift in the balance in financing this industry,’ Property Observer reports. 

In August first home buyer activity hit a new low, with the worst sales levels in 15 years.

There were 6,054 first home buyers committed to housing finance over the month, according to RP Data research which used finance data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

At the moment, in most cases young people cannot access their superannuation before the age of 60

The dramatic decline in people joining the property ladder has been blamed on rising property prices, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.

It has also been linked to changes made to the availability of First Home Buyer grants, which vary from state to state.

The states showing the most severe first home buyer trends are NSW, Victoria, Queensland and the ACT.

At the moment most young people cannot access their superannuation before the age of 60 unless they satisfy one of 14 conditions of release.

These conditions include severe financial hardship, death, permanent disability and compassionate grounds.
