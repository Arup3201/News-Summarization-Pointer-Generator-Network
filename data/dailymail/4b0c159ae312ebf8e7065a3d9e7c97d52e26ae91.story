Businessman Andrew Priest outside Macclesfield Magistrates' Court yesterday where he was accused of speeding, using threatening words or behaviour or causing criminal damage

A businessman unleashed a foul mouthed tirade at police in front of a class of children after he was stopped for speeding during a primary school project, a court heard yesterday.

Andrew Priest, 39, who was late for a meeting, ranted at community police officers and staff when nine pupils clocked his sports car doing 37mph in a 30mph zone outside their school gates, it was claimed.

The telecommunications company boss was said to have angrily performed a wheelspin into the school car park in his Audi A3 and told a PCSO: 'It’s a f****** joke, you’re PCSOs and not even proper pigs. Go and stop some more innocent people.'

As the children looked on, Priest also allegedly argued about the accuracy of the speed gun and gesticulated angrily at a classroom assistant yelling: 'Is this what you f****** teach kids? What sort of school is this?'

Later when told by a regular constable he would have to pay a £60 fixed penalty notice for speeding, Priest retorted: “I earn £80,000 a year so I can afford the ticket. My f****** solicitor will get me off. I’m going to f****** have you. You’re f*****, I’m going to make a complaint against you.'

Priest was eventually handcuffed but he then allegedly grabbed the officer’s police hat and stamped on it before he was bundled into the back of a police van.

The children were said to be so upset by his four letter outburst they had to be ushered back into the classroom at Gorsey Bank primary school in Wilmslow, Cheshire. A letter was later sent out to all parents detailing what happened.

Details of the four letter rant emerged 
as Priest, who lives in a £300,000 flat in Mobberley, Cheshire denied 
speeding, using threatening words or behaviour or causing criminal 
damage.

The incident occurred in November last 
year after the police officers were taking part in a 'school speed 
watch' project with nine Year 6 pupils as part of Road Safety Week.

Any motorists stopped speeding were 
given the option of taking a fine, or explaining to children in a 'kids 
court' at the school why they broke the speed limit.

But
trouble began when Priest who was on his way to a meeting was pulled 
over in his silver Audi A3 magistrates in Macclesfield heard.

Priest was stopped by a PCSO and a group of schoolchildren involved in a project to tackle speeding

Teaching assistant Debra Barker told the hearing: 'He was very, very angry from the minute he was pulled over. He was aggressive and was using lots of ‘f’ words saying. ‘it’s not even f****** calibrated, it’s a laser’.

'I told the children the man had obviously had a bad day but they were worried and I kept trying to to reassure them. He said, ‘is this what you f****** teach kids? What sort of school is this?’ ... I felt very vulnerable and I felt awkward.

'He screeched into the car park. He drove his car forward, his wheels were spinning and he drove aggressively into the car park.

'He got out and walked up to the PCSO
and squared up to him. I thought it was going to come to fisticuffs and
he was going to punch him.'

PCSO
Gareth Harding said: 'He was instantly argumentative and wouldn’t let 
me show him the speed - instead saying the machine wasn’t calibrated.

The telecommunications company boss told a PCSO: 'You're not even proper pigs. Go and stop some more innocent people.'

'He started gesturing towards the pupils. I warned him about his language and behaviour but he jumped out of the car came straight towards me and started swearing and shouting.

'The teacher clearly looked very concerned for the children, a lot of them were starting to get quite agitated, looking like they didn’t want to be there at all. A few of them were quite distressed.'

PCSO Rebecca Wooley said: 'I explained that a speed gun had detected the speed he was going but he said he was not speeding and his speedometer had not shown him as speeding.

'He was angry and very irritated - his voice was raised and his demeanour came across as agitated.  He made reference to the teacher and pointed and said ‘you want to teach your kids properly. The children were becoming more distressed, they weren’t used to that sort of behaviour, so I advised the teaching assistant to take them back into the school.

The trial has been adjourned until January 21st 2013.
