Not so long ago the very presence of a father in the delivery room was virtually unheard of, with dads-to-be pacing maternity unit corridors while midwives patiently guided a woman through the most gruelling — and joyous — moment of her life.

Times have moved on. Now fathers are expected to play an integral role.

But surely times haven’t moved on so far that the father — even a multi-millionaire pop star father — expects to be centre of attention on a global scale while his wife endures the agonies of labour?

Williams sports his best boy-band grin to soothe wife Ayda as she lies in discomfort

No wonder, then, that Robbie Williams’ tasteless video diary (viewed by more than 17 million people on Facebook alone) and inane Twitter commentary from his wife’s bedside as she gave birth to their second child has triggered such a negative reaction.

There cannot be a woman in the world whose deepest sympathies did not go out to Mrs Williams, aka Ayda Field, as the singer filmed her during her most private moments. We even saw her in red spangly Louboutin stilettos while her legs were in stirrups. Most husbands would be happy to let their labouring partners relax in a pair of comfy old slippers and a flannel night-gown. Not so Robbie, who seemed to be telling the world that Ayda was a sex object for his delectation, even while giving birth.

Then we were forced to watch the pain of her contractions. Hard to stomach? Yes. But perhaps most bewildering was the way in which Williams turned the birth of his own baby into a series of clips — one showed the 40-year-old former Take That star doing a lengthy dance routine at his wife’s bedside — in which there was, very clearly, only one star. And that certainly wasn’t Ayda.

Let’s be clear. I’ve no doubt at all that Robbie loves his wife to bits. As Sarah Vine wrote in the Mail yesterday, he is ‘clearly, deliriously in love’.

But while his videos are no doubt intended to be affectionate, fun and tongue in cheek, there was no escaping the person they were intended to promote. While it might be comedy, it was also vanity.

In an age when it seems a week does not go by without celebrities revealing their most private moments on social media, Robbie Williams appears to have trumped them all.

‘Will it get on my gown?’ Robbie quips as his long-suffering wife begins to give birth to their second child

After all, if the entry of a new life into the world is not sancrosanct, what is? Even those celebrities who have sold media rights to their weddings, or shared the most intimate confessions about their sex lives, must have cringed watching these videos — and hopefully seen how out of control self-revelation has become.

To start with, Ayda’s contractions are mild enough for the 35-year-old actress to play along with his weak jokes. In the first clip, he sits uninterestedly staring at his laptop while she sets an inappropriately sexy tone with a half-hearted lap dance.

She attempts to catch his attention by leaning over at 45 degrees to do a Miley Cyrus-style ‘twerk’ — not easy with a substantial baby bump.

‘He is loving it. That computer is just hiding his erection,’ Ayda says, managing in one sentence to go along with her husband’s reduction of the birthing experience to ‘entertainment’ at its most lewd and crass.

Another clip shows the singer limping along a hospital corridor with a drip as his wife follows. After that, we see him chirpily inform viewers who are ‘really concerned and worried and thinking about what’s going on’ that he, Robbie, is doing great.

The bizarre videos, shot in a Los Angeles hospital, were interspersed with Williams’ witterings on Twitter, such as, ‘It’s ok, I’ve totally got this’ alongside a picture of him at his wife’s bedside, pulling his best boy-band grin, even while Ayda was clearly in pain and distress.

But worse was to come. The next clip showed Ayda grimacing and puffing before her face disappears and all we can see is a pair of legs in the air as a doctor ducks down to check on the delivery then tells her to ‘push’.

Is Robbie holding his wife’s hand? No. He is singing the hit Frozen theme tune Let It Go. Even long- suffering Ayda tells him to shut up.

The only thing we did not witness in the creation of this new life, it seems, was the moment of conception itself.

And perhaps the most bewildering thing of all? The uber-showman didn’t give his fans their obvious finale; we never get to see even a picture of his 8lb 2oz son.

Of course, discretion about even the most private sexual matters seems impossible for many celebs these days.

Kate Winslet has told us she has waxed her nether regions so much she now needs a pubic wig for some film scenes. Michael Douglas revealed he uses Viagra, and in her album released this summer, Lily Allen sang about her husband Sam’s unparalleled ability to delay sexual climax.

Williams rather too candidly revealed that he and Ayda were ‘practising’ for a second child following the birth of their first, Theodora, in 2012. The list goes on.

Conversations better kept private are now also broadcast over Twitter.

TV presenter Melanie Sykes could have sent Jack Cockings private texts at the start of their relationship. Instead she announced over Twitter to him — and around 140,000 followers — ‘I’ve got the raging horn, please take me.’

In a society where celebrities are now partly judged on the size of their Twitter following, they seem to feel the need to shout louder and break new boundaries.

How depressing that the famous — and those who imitate them — are increasingly stuck in the developmental fishbowl of a four-year-old, with that ‘Look at me Mummy!’ desire to be centre of attention at all times.

The irony of Robbie’s pregnancy video is that in August he took to Twitter to complain that pictures had appeared in a German Magazine of him playing at the seaside with his older child, Theodora. Robbie said he felt ‘sick and violated’.

He still re-tweeted the magazine page to his 2.35 million followers.

It doesn’t appear to occur to Robbie that he is personally invading his wife’s privacy by filming her. While no doubt at the start she’s capable of giving her permission, by the end she appears helpless and drugged up.

Labour is the moment at which a woman is at the most vulnerable she will ever be. Yet instead of reassuring his wife, the former Take That singer simply tunes out her moans by turning up the volume on a succession of cheesy ballads.

At one point, Ayda throws her head back in distress, with a look that says the only show she wants her husband to put on is a disappearing act. But Robbie is too busy miming and dancing to one of his hits to notice.

Dismayed she is concentrating on her contractions rather than him, he taps her on the arm. Finding himself ignored again, he tells whoever is filming the scene to stop, before flouncing off. Is he joking around? Well. Not even the two people on the chairs behind him, presumably relatives, look vaguely amused.

Never mind the little life waiting to emerge — it’s clear the biggest baby in this room is Robbie himself.

The pair looking slightly more demure

As the birth draws closer, we see Robbie making a show of helping his wife, by holding a gas-and-air mask over her face to help her control the pain. The only surprise here is that the star doesn’t take a sniff of the gas himself. It might have been helpful to calm him down.

The grisly denouement comes when a genuinely scared-looking Ayda, by now naked below the waist, covers her eyes with her hands as a doctor tells her he is going to have to break her waters with the gynaecological equivalent to a crochet hook — and announces it will be messy. Robbie exits stage right with the quip: ‘Will any of it go over my gown?’

It seems the star has not grown up at all since describing the birth of his daughter Theodora in 2012 as like ‘the first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan’.

It might be easy to dismiss Williams’ antics as the efforts of a limelight-hogging star to garner some publicity. While he remains a much-loved entertainer around the world, Robbie is not quite the mega-star he once was, in the UK anyway.

But his social media posts are an extreme example of a disturbing trend to reduce life’s most intimate moments to nothing more than a cheap reality show. We’re turning into a nation of narcissists and voyeurs.

This year we have already seen marketing executive Lyndsey Thomas, 34, from North London, commentating on the birth of her child live on Twitter. Then Josie Cunningham, who sparked huge condemnation for getting a breast operation on the NHS, sold tickets to the birth of her baby for over £10,000 each.

So far the reaction to Robbie’s video has been decidedly mixed, with some fans saying they love the singer’s openness — while others argued he had only cemented his reputation as an attention-obsessed narcissist.

But that won’t worry Robbie, who announces in the final clip after the birth: ‘No Moms were harmed during the making of any of these videos.’

Ayda sits blithely next to him, smiling again and looking understandably relieved it’s all over, adding she is still under the influence of the pain-relieving drugs.

Once she has time to reflect on the experience of bringing her second child into the world, it remains to be seen whether she will continue to agree with him.
