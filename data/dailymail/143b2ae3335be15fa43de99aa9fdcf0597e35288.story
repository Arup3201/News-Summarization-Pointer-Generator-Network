A couple who have spent their life savings on three unsuccessful rounds of IVF have been given hope of starting a family after total strangers donated thousands of dollars to help pay their medical costs.

Melanie and Joseph Cassar, from St Clair, Sydney, feared their dream of becoming parents was over after the last IVF cycle failed. 

Insisting they would never give up hope, they have now started a crowd-funding website to raise $8,500 to undergo a fourth treatment.

‘I feel an empty void in my life that I'm destined to be a mum, and Joe a dad, but we need help,’ Ms Cassar explained on the website.

Ms Cassar said she knew at age 18 that the road to fertility would be tough after learning that she had polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Doctors explained her ovaries were irregular and covered in cysts, making it difficult to produce eggs capable of fertilisation.

‘I did all the tests and they said your only option is IVF' Ms Cassar told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Cassar has undergone three full IVF treatments and said it costs around $8,500 each time, with Medicare returning $5,000.

12,000 babies were born using IVF in Australia last year but Ms Cassa says doctors can give  no guarantees the treatment will work

Ms Cassa’s passion for children prompted her to start running a day care but she says this only makes her desire to be a mother stronger 

Out of pocket expenses for IVF treatment have increased from around $1,500 per cycle to $3,500, with new changes meaning couples must spend at least $2,000 to qualify for the Medicare safety net.  

Mr Cassar says it’s been ‘heartbreaking’ to watch his wife go through the treatments without getting the child they have coveted for so long.

'There are no guarantees with IVF,’ Ms Cassar explained. 

‘It’s an emotional rollercoaster. You always try to look at the positives but sometimes when you get your hopes up, they just crash,’ she added.

After running out of money to spend on the treatments Ms Cassar said her family and friends asked her how they could donate, prompting her to create the gofundme.com appeal.

With $1,455 raised in only 8 days the couple remain hopeful that 'this year might be our year' 

Support is pouring in with anonymous donations of up to $300 from strangers who would like nothing more than to see a healthy baby in the couples arms.  

The couple say although they have experienced more hardships than they imagined, they won't give up on their dream of having a healthy child of their own.

‘As much as we can afford, we will keep going.’
