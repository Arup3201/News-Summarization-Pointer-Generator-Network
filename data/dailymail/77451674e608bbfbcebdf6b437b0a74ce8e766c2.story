She's the celebrity lifestyle guru known to her fans as the 'Skinny Rich Coach' and caused outrage when her book, How To Be Selfish (And Other Uncomfortable Advice), championed the merits of putting yourself first - regardless of what others think.

Now Olga Levancuka is back and this time she's turned her attention to parents, whom, she says, need to learn to say no to their children.

But is she right? Her views might enrage you but here she explains why being a 'selfish parent' can be good for your children.

Take control: Celebrity lifestyle guru Olga Levancuka says parents need to be much more selfish

'It’s a well-known fact, the more attention, care and love we give to our children, the better parents we are and, in turn, the better human beings our children will grow up to be. But it just isn’t true.

The more you give in, the less respect you’ll receive from your children and the more things and stuff they’ll expect to get away with.  

With all the pressure building up, the moments when you’d give anything to get out of the house become more and more frequent. 

By the time the children hit puberty, you are like a set of guitar strings at a rock concert - with your nervous system, aka the guitar, stretched to breaking point.

So how do you deal with the pain of parenting, protect your children from your own tantrums and attempt to inject a little peace and mutual respect into your nest? 

Me time: Parents should schedule in time for themselves and not chase their children around constantly

Discovery: According to Olga, letting children do their own thing while you do yours is a good idea

Perhaps it’s time you learned how to be selfish to protect your sanity, your health and to ensure your long lasting support and presence in your child's life.

And who would be best to learn from how to be selfish? From your very own progeny of course! They know how to be selfish best.

Kids are excellent psychologists and are great at getting other people to do their tasks for them. Do the same.

Get your kids to do stuff for you. You are not their servant, nor the doormat. The earlier you stop behaving like one, the earlier they’ll grow to respect you.

It's even better if you can find some tasks to do together, although don't forget to throw in some fun and enjoyable activities too.

But it's not just about your child. Just as they are your responsibility, so is your body so make some time to take care of it.

Create a close network of parents-friends, and agree on a day when they look after your kids so that you get some ‘you’-time. Return the favour to keep the benefits coming.

Then there's dealing with the inevitable tantrums and endless arguments about Junior's desire to do something other than homework or chores.

The longer you take to explain yourself, the shorter time you have left for doing your chores and that much needed and important ‘you’ time.

Say what you need to say (two sentences max) and get on with your and your child’s life. Your children will hear what you said (even adults only remember the first and the last statements) and you will be heard. Which at times is so important to overworked mothers.

Kids learn from you too. Make sure you are an ever-lasting source of knowledge and inspiration, so sign up for adult courses.

Be adventurous, choose things that are exciting and different to your daily routine. For example: sculpture making, life drawing classes, language courses, singing lessons. With other adults.

But although you aren't the only one who benefits from learning, that doesn't mean you need to over-praise your children when they deign to pick up a pen.

Big plans: Olga is known as the 'Skinny Rich Coach' to her fans and says she can help you achieve both

Best seller: Olga's book How To Be Selfish champions the concept of putting yourself first

There is a constant battle between teachers and kids that is directed at getting the results. The results that school first of all seek.  

The priority is clearly on success and some kids are getting all worked up trying to please adults without even understanding why something is good and why something is bad.

Think for yourself. If a child, after a long struggle, finally solves her math tasks, does she really need to be told that she has done well?

Doesn’t she know, without being told, that she has accomplished something? Don’t waste your time over-praising.

Don’t call your kid ‘good girl’. Let children get on with their own discoveries, while you get on with your life. Don’t we have enough ‘failures’ from trying to please our parents?

To make what you want crystal clear, say it once and then get on and do it. Believe me, it’s easier when kids know where they stand with you.

If you say that you want to see the movie, but then go to the kitchen, and start cleaning the mess, you send mixed signals to your children. 

They don’t think that you have to clean 
the kitchen. They think the words you say are worth ignoring. Next time 
you say 'I want to go to a movie' and you still need to clean up, say 'I
 want to go to the movie, but first I need to clean up the kitchen 
because the mess makes me upset'.

No-no: Spending your days indulging your child's every whim could result in big problems for both of you

If the child offers you help, take it. 
Children want you happy! Then go to the movie. The children will know 
your words ‘are worth listening to.'

Finally, stop sacrificing your happiness for your child’s satisfaction. Such ‘Samaritan’ acts are a double-edged sword in disguise.

Today the child is happy, tomorrow they ask for more. You want to see your child smiling, you now need to bend yourself more. Who wins?

In the long run, it won't be you or the child. You will pay with your mental and physical health, the child later will pay another significant price.

Kids know when they make you suffer. They regret it and they start blaming themselves. Slowly they resent themselves, and then … surprise, surprise, you, for letting them make you suffer.

Instead, stop accepting the pressure from your children - or indeed, the other parents who feel the need to impose their methods on you.

Choose your own way in parenting, and in your personal life. The child will follow your example eventually and you’ll be rewarded twice over.

You’ll get to keep your life (well, most if it!); and your child will grow up with a better understanding of an individual space, needs and responsibilities.
