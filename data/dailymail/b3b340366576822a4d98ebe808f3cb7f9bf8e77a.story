This brave group of Aussie veterinary students bar-ed all in a desperate bid to raise cash to pay for their graduation ball. 

The students at James Cook University in Queensland bravely shed all their clothes for the two shoots which took place on a farm and in their vet school classrooms. 

Organiser Angela Davey, 24, told Daily Mail Australia there were a couple of awkward moments during the shoots- when a couple of unsuspecting security guards stumbled upon their shoot in the university and a farmer who nearly crashed his tractor into a fence.

Ten per cent of proceeds from the calender are going to the Black River and District Rural Fire Brigade

Animals snapped in the shoot included horses, dogs, bison, baby guinea pigs, a macaw and a blue-tongued lizard. 

The calender is called Vets Uncovered and Townsville photographer Vicki Miller had the honour of snapping the vets being at one with nature.

Angela, who is from Darwin but studying in Townsville, said: 'When we first started to think about fundraising ideas for our graduation ball, I suggested a nude calendar as a bit of a joke.

The students bear-ed all for the unique shoot for their fundraising calender 

'A couple of other students jumped on board, and we started to look into it a bit more seriously. When we found that it was a legitimate option, we presented the idea to the class.

'We took inspiration from a vet from Massey University in New Zealand which has a tradition of publishing Barely There nude calenders.

'We told the class how much money we could potentially make and I think that was when everyone realised that it was actually a serious fundraising venture and not a joke.'

The calender is expected to raise $44,000 and they hope to sell 2000 copies.

The group of 38 students had two different photo shoots for the calender- one at Ms Miller's property 100km south west of Townsville and a second in Townsville at the Vet School and Turf Club.

Andrea said the group was not ready for what they were going to encounter on their first shoot.

She said: 'I think we all had this idea in our heads that we would probably be able to wear underwear for most of the photos, and strategically place animals and objects in front of us to make it look like we were naked.

'We were all thrown a little out of our comfort zones when, for the very first photo, Vicki instructed the students to take everything off, and go stand in the yard with a bunch of cattle.

'After that, we just had to deal with the fact that we were totally naked with our classmates.

Two security guards stumbled upon the group when they were carrying out a naked study session 

'Thankfully, our class is full of amazing people, and everyone was so supportive of one another. It didn't take long before we were all quite comfortable with it, and we had a lot of fun.'

The class will be donating 10 per cent of what we raise to the Black River and District Rural Fire Brigade, for the development of their Townsville Region Training Facility.

The much anticipated ball will be held at the end of 2015 and the location is yet to be decided.
