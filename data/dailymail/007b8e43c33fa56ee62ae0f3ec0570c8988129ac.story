The birth of a newborn baby is always very special occasion, but at one U.S hospital it’s even more magical – thanks to a doctor who sings to each and every child that he helps to deliver.

Dr Carey Andrew-Jaja, who works at the Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh, particularly enjoys singing Happy Birthday or What A Wonderful World to the tiny humans he’s delivered.

The songs are his way of celebrating with the family.

He said: ‘It opens a big connection between us. I enjoy an opportunity to celebrate with the family. The bond is instantaneous when you connect this way.’

Dr Andrew-Jaja also believes that it’s a way of forgetting about the world’s problems for a few minutes.

He said: ‘It's a beautiful world we live in and forget about all the crisis going on everywhere for a moment, when you see that miracle of life in front of you.

‘It's special. Each of them is an individual and I've delivered thousands of babies. When I'm singing to those babies I think I'm singing to a future important person - that's the credit I give to all of them.’

Dr Andrew-Jaja’s crooning began when a more senior physician who enjoyed singing to babies approached retirement and encouraged him to do the same.

He said: ‘He passed the baton onto me and I've sung to my babies ever since then and I do it every time.’

Dr Andrew-Jaja’s serenading was met with a chorus of approval by internet users, with a YouTube video of him singing garnering almost one million views.

User Alison Nash wrote: ‘This brought tears to my eyes. How beautiful.’

And Ron Baker commented: ‘That was incredible and should be required of all doctors that deliver babies...’
