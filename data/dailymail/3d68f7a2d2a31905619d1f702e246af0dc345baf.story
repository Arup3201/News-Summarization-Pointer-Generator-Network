Lavish tastes: Despite turning down a £963,000 bonus following an outcry, Stephen Hester's extravagant lifestyle has come under fire

RBS boss Stephen Hester is renting a £260,000-a-year Victorian mansion - on top of the two multimillion-pound properties he already owns.

Hester, who has run the taxpayer-backed bank since 2008, has begun renting the five-bedroom townhouse to live with new bride new bride Suzy Neubert, 47, according to reports.

The £1.2million-a-year Royal Bank of Scotland boss separated from his Canadian-born wife Barbara in 2010.

Mr
Hester has also relinquished ownership of their magnificent £8.6million marital home in London's salubrious Kensington to her.

The
couple, married almost 20 years with two children, purchased the 
five-bedroom, four-bathroom mansion in one of the capital’s most 
exclusive areas in 1995 for £1.78million.

But while Mr Hester may have 'lost' the 
London home, he can fall back on his vast country pile in Oxfordshire, a
350-acre estate complete with eight gardeners.

It boasts a turreted tree house, tennis court, swimming pool and open-air jacuzzi. The grounds include extensive landscaped gardens, featuring rare trees from around the globe

And there is always the 
ski chalet in exclusive resort Verbier with mountain views, a large central fireplace, wine cellar and sauna.

Mother-of-two Miss Neubert works in the City, as head of sales and marketing for
private bank J O Hambro, which handles the funds of hugely wealthy 
individuals.

She was married to Jolyon Neubert, the barrister son of Tory MP Sir Michael Neubert, with whom she had two daughters.

Yorkshireman Mr Hester has had a 
glittering, and financially rewarding, career, starting at Credit 
Suisse, then Abbey National and property company British Land before taking over RBS from the disastrous leadership of Fred 'The Shred' Goodwin four years ago.

RBS had to be bailed out by the taxpayer when it emerged it had made losses of £24billion, the biggest loss in banking history.

As a result it is still 82-per-cent owned by the taxpayer.

But despite turning down a £963,000 bonus following a vast public outcry, his extravagant lifestyle - and £1.2million salary - has come under fire.

The country pile: A 350-acre countryside estate, it boasts a turreted tree house, tennis court, swimming pool and open-air jacuzzi. The grounds include extensive landscaped gardens, featuring rare trees from around the globe

Weeks after he took over at RBS, 
recruited to end the culture of excess, details emerged of his 
magnificent country estate, which has one of the most spectacular 
gardens in Britain.

The gardeners are paid salaries of up to £20,000 to tend it throughout the year.

Part
of it was designed and created by celebrity landscape architect Tom 
Stuart-Smith, who has worked for Karl Lagerfeld and billionaire 
philanthropist John Paul Getty.

The grounds include an 80-acre arboretum, parterre, sunken garden and water meadow.

RBS sources said the bank was not contributing to the rent of the new townhouse, which would cost around £8million to buy.

A spokesman told The Sun: 'We never comment about the private living arrangements of staff.'
