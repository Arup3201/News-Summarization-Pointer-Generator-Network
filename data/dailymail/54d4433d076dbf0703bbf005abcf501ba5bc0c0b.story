This is the moment that a U.S. Embassy worker is arrested by Russian Intelligence services - who waste no time in pulling off his cap with a flourish to reveal a floppy blond wig, allegedly proving that he is a 'CIA spy'.

Looking more Austin Powers than James Bond, diplomat Ryan Fogle was thrown down and 
handcuffed in a night-time sting on Monday by the FSB secret service – formerly 
the KGB. He faces expulsion from Russia.

In the 48-second clip posted on YouTube, a Russian agent removes the American's beige baseball cap to reveal an ill-fitting blonde wig. It sits at an awkward angle on his head, revealing his real dark hair below.

Just call me James... blond? Russian intelligence services parade the 'CIA spy', named as Ryan Christopher Fogle, for cameras on Monday

Revealed: The Russian agent removes the floppy blonde wig from the alleged American spy who is accused of trying to have Russian agents defect

Spy games: The alleged spy's ill-fitting wig is exposed during the swoop in Moscow

Moments later, Fogle is marched to a waiting car in Moscow surrounded by burly men.

Russian intelligence services say that the 'spy' offered millions of pounds to a senior Russian agent.

He had a rudimentary espionage kit 
containing a compass, map of Moscow, knives, a microphone, two wigs, 
three pairs of glasses, plastic bags containing thousands of euros and 
an RFID Shield, which prevents passports with computer chips being read 
remotely, Russian intelligence sources said.

The ‘agent’, a third secretary in the 
political section of the US embassy, was quizzed in the FSB’s feared 
Lubyanka complex before being handed over to US officials.

Unusually, the FSB made its coup 
public at once. It released pictures of a man being arrested in a blue-checked shirt, dirty-blond wig and baseball cap, along with images of 
him in detention.

Arrested: The US diplomat - suspected by the Russian of being a CIA agent - was named as Ryan Christopher Fogle. He was arrested last night in Moscow

Claims: The FSB counter intelligence service said the envoy, a third secretary in the political section of the American embassy was caught red handed seeking to recruit a Russian intelligence officer

Detained: The FSB said Fogle was in possession of two floppy wigs, three pairs of glasses, a map of Moscow and a folding knife when he was detained

Seized: After his arrest, he was taken to the FSB headquarters at the Lubyanka, in Moscow, and later handed over to the US embassy in keeping with diplomatic protocols

Last night spy sources said Fogle was 
caught after a lengthy covert operation. US ambassador Michael McFaul – 
who refused to comment on the news – has been summoned to Russia’s 
foreign ministry.

Meanwhile, U.S. secretary of state John 
Kerry and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov are due to meet in 
Sweden today after successful talks earlier this month.

Fogle was the first American diplomat to be publicly accused of spying in Russia in about a decade.

While
relations between the two countries have been strained, officials in 
both Washington and Moscow sought to play down the incident.

Statement: 'Recently, the US intelligence service has made repeated attempts to recruit the staff of Russian law enforcement agencies and special services,' according to the FSB

Stash: He was detained with 'special technical devices, written instructions for the person he was recruiting, a lot of cash, and things to help change one's appearance,' according to the FSB

Mission: The website of the American embassy in Russia informs that its Political Section is engaged in 'bringing to the attention of the Russian government the US position on the issues of foreign policy and security'

Questions: A letter the agent carried suggested the US government was willing to pay up to $1 million a year plus bonuses to his unidentified potential Russian recruit, if the letter released by the FSB is genuine

Release: Fogle was held overnight before being released to U.S. officials and expelled from Russia

The arrest of Ryan Fogle is just the latest twist in the long history of spying between the U.S. and Russia. Famously, 10 Russian sleeper agents were arrested in 2010 and accused of pretending to be ordinary Americans while secretly plotting against the country. The best-known is Anna Chapman, above, who has become a major celebrity in her home country since being deported from the U.S.

In the Cold War period, however, U.S.-Soviet espionage was often a matter of life and death - in 1985, military officer Arthur D. Nicholson was shot dead by a Soviet sentry while spying in East Germany. One of the war's major crises was caused by the shooting down of an American spy plane in 1960 and the subsequent capture of its pilot.

Fogle was caught in Vorontsovski Park, an area in south-east Moscow, the FSB said.

They implied that he wanted to contact a senior FSB agent who was snooping on Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the alleged Boston bomber.

A letter in Russian which Fogle 
carried suggests – if genuine – that the CIA hoped to reel in a big 
fish.

Addressed ‘Dear friend’, it states: ‘We are ready to offer you 
$100,000 [£65,000] and discuss your experience, expertise and 
co-operation, and the payment may go much higher if you are ready to 
answer certain questions.

‘For long-term co-operation we offer $1million [£650,000] per year.’

The recruit is instructed to use an 
internet cafe to ‘create a new Gmail mailbox which you will use only for
staying in touch with us’.

The incident is the biggest spy 
scandal since the arrest of glamorous agent Anna Chapman and nine other 
Russians in the US in 2010.

The FSB stated: ‘Recently, the US 
intelligence community has made repeated attempts to recruit employees 
of Russia’s law-enforcement bodies and special agencies.’

Many details remained shrouded in 
mystery last night. It is not known whether the target was part of the 
sting operation or if they have been arrested.

Russia’s haste to make the news public
could mean either that the attempt was so audacious that it shocked 
leaders, or that hardliners have seized on it to stop a move towards 
detente with the US.

Yesterday Patty Fogle, the diplomat’s mother, refused to comment at her home in St Louis, Missouri.
