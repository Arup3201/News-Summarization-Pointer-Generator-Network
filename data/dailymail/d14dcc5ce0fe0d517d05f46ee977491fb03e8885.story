David Cameron has revealed his struggle to keep in touch with world leaders while on holiday in Cornwall – because he can’t get a mobile signal.

The Prime Minister has been forced to drive to the top of a hill to get a connection on his phone to deal with the fall of Gaddafi in Libya and the bloody civil war in Syria.

Mr Cameron, who holidays in Cornwall every year, said it was ‘very frustrating’ that parts of the country were still left in ‘not-spots’ without a decent phone signal.

While most people go on holiday to get away from the stress and strains of work, Mr Cameron’s trips to Cornwall are rarely uneventful.

Last summer he was forced to cut it short his break to return to London to deal with the conflict in Syria. In 2011 his holiday was curtailed by a similar crisis in Libya.

In 2010, weeks after he became Prime Minister, Mr Cameron’s holiday was interrupted by the early arrival of baby daughter Florence.

Downing Street always insists that even while taking a break in the sunshine, Mr Cameron remains in touch and in charge of the country.

But now he has revealed that as he drives into the North Cornwall surfing village of Polzeath, his mobile signal disappears.

He told the WMN on Sunday that poor technology 'affects Prime Ministers making important calls wherever they are, but it affects everybody'.

Asked if his phone has dropped out in Cornwall when on a call to President Obama, Mr Cameron replied: ‘As I go down a hill into Polzeath, I know exactly which bit of the road I lose my signal. So it is a problem. I know where to go to get a signal, but it can be very frustrating.’

Ministers are already discussing plans to negotiate with mobile phone operators and asking them to help increase coverage by sharing phone masts, which would allow for the introduction of national roaming in the UK.

National roaming sees phones switching from one operator to another when service is not available through a particular provider, which is what happens when people travel abroad.

It would address the problem of partial 'not-spots', areas where only some of the major networks are available.

After struggling with his phone signal in Cornwall, Mr Cameron was forced to return to London in August last year to deal with the Syrian civil war 

Mr Cameron added: ‘This is a really big issue for people all over the country - the ‘not-spots’,' he says of mobile phone coverage.

‘It’s not good enough to say here’s the mobile coverage for the whole country. You have got to recognise a lot of people are making important calls while they are on the move. We do need to improve the coverage of the mobile phone signal.

‘For rural communities not being connected to super-fast broadband is a bit like not being connected to the road network. It’s that bad. So much work is being done online and that it really is a ‘must-have’. We’ve got to crack this.’

Mr Cameron dashed back to London in August to deal with the Syrian crisis. After holding talks by phone with US President Barack Obama, the PM pushed for British military intervention.

But he was humiliated when Labour and Tory MPs voted to block any British involvement in taking on the regime of Bashar al Assad
