Two nursing home patients died from fatal doses of insulin and another was left hospitalised after complaints were made about a staff member, police have alleged.

Marie Darragh, 82, and Isobella Spencer 77, were found unconscious in their beds and died a short time last in their Ballina nursing home in northern NSW in May.

Police allege a 46-year-old nurse from the St Andrews Village Aged Cared facility administered the insulin to Ms Darragh and Ms Spencer in the middle of the night.

The nurse was arrested in Seaspray in Victoria on Monday and is expected to arrive in Sydney on Tuesday night with homicide detectives, to be charged with the two alleged murders, as well as the assault of an 88-year-old woman.

The 88-year-old resident was allegedly woken in the middle of the night to find the nurse trying to give her 'unscheduled medication'.

Marie Darragh, 82, was one of two women found unconscious in their beds on May 10 by staff at St Andrews Village nursing home in Ballina

Homicide squad boss Detective Superintendent Mick Willing said the nurse would be charged with two counts of murder and assault.

'We are alleging two of the three victims made complaints about the 46-year-old during the course of her employment,' he said. It is understood one of the women who died, and the 88-year-old were behind the complaints.

Det Supt Willing said the nurse was on registered days off after the deaths and then handed in her registration when she allegedly fled to Victoria, where she used to live.

'The woman, following the deaths of the two elderly residents, left the nursing home on her own accord and moved to Seaspray,' Det Supt Willing said.

The Melbourne Magistrates Court, where the nurse appeared on Tuesday to be extradited to NSW, heard she had never been in police custody before and was taking medication for severe depression.

Following the arrest, St Andrews Aged Care CEO Pip Carter said the news was devastating.

'I want to reassure residents and the community that the safety and care of St Andrews' residents always has been and always will be a priority,' she said.

In June, MailOnline reported that police confirmed they were 'looking at the actions of all nursing home staff' in relation to the deaths and are examining what medications the elderly residents were given.

Ms Darragh, who was on the brink of death when she moved to the Ballina nursing home three years ago, managed to turn her health around after she quit smoking.

Ms Darragh's daughter, Charli Matterson, told the ABC her mum had lived at the home for three years and was healthy at the time she died

Her daughter, Janet Parkinson, said her mother's new-found health and happiness made the suspected murder so much harder to deal with.

'It's total heartbreak,' Ms Parkinson said on Thursday.

'Because when she went in there she was ready to die. She was so frail and it has taken them three and a half years to get her where she was.

'They built her up and she had to go this way ... that's the heartbreaking thing.'

The women were pronounced dead before paramedics arrived just before Mother's Day.

A third elderly woman at the nursing home was attacked on the same night but survived. She is understood to be helping police with their investigation and her name has not been released.

The nursing home said she is in good health and is back at the facility after a stint in hospital.

Detectives believe they have a good idea how both women died and have questioned nursing home staff.

'Obviously we are looking at the actions of staff members that night. However, we are keeping an open mind,' Detective Superintendent Mick Willing said.

'The fact that these deaths occurred in unexpected circumstances on the same night, in the same location, prompted an immediate response from homicide investigators.

'There is nothing to suggest the women's deaths are in any way linked to deaths in other nursing homes.'

Ms Darragh was a grandmother to 11 and mother of three including Charli Matterson

Det Supt said the management and staff at St Andrews Village nursing home had been very supportive of the detectives managing the case.

Ms Parkinson said she had her own suspicions about what happened, but could not speak highly enough of the nursing home staff.

'Obviously I have missed something,' she said.

Ms Darragh, a grandmother to 11 and mother of three, had 'loved' living at the nursing home, according to her daughter.

The manager of the nursing home, Phillip Carter, said that the cause of the women's deaths was still unknown but that the deaths have 'deeply distressed staff, residents and their families'.

'The police have advised me they do not have conclusive information on the causes of death at this stage,' he said.

'St Andrews acted immediately to involve the police because the deaths were unexpected.

'We understand the pain of losing a loved one and we are doing all we can to assist police.'

He also said he knew nothing about the assault on the third woman.

'All I've been told is there's an investigation because of two unexpected deaths. They haven't consulted with me about anyone else being assaulted or tampered with,' he told MailOnline.

Police did not disclose any further details about the women's deaths but said there was no 'existing threat' at the nursing home
