Three lapdancers dressed in ‘miniskirts, stilettos and Daisy Duke shorts’ kidnapped a club boss, a court was told.

Curtis Woodman said he was outside his office when the women, their female manager and two men drove up in two BMWs.

Mr Woodman said they ‘surrounded him’ before bundling him into one of the cars and driving off.

The women claimed he owed them more than £20,000 for working at his pop-up nightclub during the Cheltenham Festival in March 2012.

It is alleged that Mr Woodman was kidnapped, robbed of £60 cash and his £4,650 Breitling watch, and assaulted during a two-hour ordeal.

He also claims he was forced to transfer £4,800 into the bank account of the lapdancers’ manager, Charlotte Devaney, while in the vehicle.

Mr Woodman, from Cheltenham, denied basing his claims on the Guy Ritchie gangster film Revolver and said the incident on September 3 last year  left him ‘in fear of his life’.

The women had been hired as hostesses for five days during the horse racing festival, and were promised 50 per cent of credit card payments, as well as all cash takings, Bristol Crown Court heard.

The terms of licensing meant that 
stripping was prohibited on certain nights – but the women still 
‘insisted on taking their clothes off’.

Mr Woodman claims they had signed contracts agreeing to wear ‘bikinis 
and nipple tassels’, but they ignored this, and forfeited their right to
 the money.

Mr Woodman told the court in the months afterwards he had received calls demanding the money from Charlotte Devaney, 34.

Accused: Robert Morris and his brother Alexander helped dump Mr Woodman in a car before taking cash and his watch, the court heard

On
 the day of the alleged incident, he said he recognised Devaney and 
lapdancers Mandy Cool, 29, Stephanie Pye, 31, and Rachel Goodchild, 24, 
when they arrived at his workplace in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, at 
around 4pm.

Brothers Robert Morris, 27, and Alexander Morris, 23, were also with the women.

‘They surrounded me,’ said Mr Woodman,
 who gave evidence from behind a screen. ‘I was worried for my safety.

He (Alexander Morris) pushed me in the car, he followed me and he sat 
next to me. He had a knife on him.’

Representing Robert Morris, Khalid Missouri suggested that Mr Woodman had entered the car by his own free will.

‘Coming
 back to the real world: stilettos, miniskirts, guys in normal clothing,
 Daisy Dukes? That doesn’t sound like an intention to kidnap you,’ he 
said.

Mr Woodman replied: ‘There was obviously some intention.’

He denied claims he had told the group he did not want to discuss the matter there and suggested going elsewhere.

Mr Woodman denied claims he had concocted the case based on the 2005 Guy Ritchie film Revolver.

Mr
 Missouri said. ‘It is about getting attention. You are not just doing 
this to get attention?

‘Guy Ritchie likes to make gangster movies, have 
you been watching too many of them?’

Earlier,
 the jury heard that Mr Woodman rented the Embassy Club in Cheltenham 
for five nights.

On the third night, police and officials shut the club 
after receiving complaints.

The
 dancers had already earned ‘considerable amounts of money’, including 
£42,000 from one customer, but Mr Woodman refused to pay them, the court
 heard.

He felt that they were not entitled to the money, as they had failed to comply with the terms of their contracts.

Alexander Morris, from Southampton, has admitted carrying a bladed article on September 3, 2012, the day of the alleged kidnap.

He and his brother deny charges of robbery relating to Mr Woodman’s watch and the £60.

Devaney, from London; Pye, from Sutton Coldfield; Cool,  of Southampton; and Goodchild, of Southampton, all  deny kidnap.

The trial continues.
