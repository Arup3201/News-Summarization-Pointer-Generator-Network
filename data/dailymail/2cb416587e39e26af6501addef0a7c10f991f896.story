Michael Vick is in the dog house again after a series of
shocking revelations made public this week in a tell-all book written by his
former mistress.

‘Quarterback Keeper’ details the secret 10 year relationship
between the former stripper and the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, including
revelations about group sex parties in his home, flights around the country for
clandestine hook-ups and even a surprising card he sent her from prison.

First reported by RadarOnline, which obtained a copy of the final manuscript, the book even dishes on an STD
scare and the crushing end to their hush-hush relationship.

Tell-all: Michael Vick's former mistress spilled the details on the decade-long affair in a book she is shopping to publishers

The book’s author has refused to reveal her real name, going
under the pen name Bella Escritor, but the seemingly innocent puppy faced card
sent from Mr Vick is addressed to a Kiana.

The front is adorned with two huggable puppies and the words
‘Thinking about our friendship.’

Mr Vick and the woman saw each other under the table while
he was publicly dating now-wife Kijafa Frink.

The former Atlanta Falcons franchise player asks her about
pictures and tells the mistress the two puppies on the front are she and him –
he was in prison for running a brutally violent dog fighting operation.

 He then tells her he
wants ‘a bag full of candy and some eye candy’ when he finishes his prison
sentence.

He repeatedly refers to her as family despite their
relationship being a secret, and then tells the exotic dancer he has her  heart and to keep the card for future
memories.

‘You my girl for life no fakin [sic],’ he wrote.

Little did he know the card would be added to a collection
of memories woven into a tell-all treasure trove of debauchery and heartache.

Surprising: Mr Vick sent his mistress a card with two puppies on it while serving a prison sentence for running a dog fighting operation

Back on the gridiron: Mr Vick was cut by the Atlanta Falcons after the dog fighting accusations were made public, but he soon found a home with the Philadelphia Eagles after being released from prison

A call placed by MailOnline to Mr Vick’s agent seeking comment
was not immediately returned.

The book also details the star-crossed couple’s first
encounter at the Atlanta club where she stripped.

‘He said only one word, ‘dance,’ and that’s exactly what I
did … Vick appeared to take it all in like a child in a candy store for the
very first time,’ she recalled, according to RadarOnline.

That night would be the first time they slept together in
his Atlanta home.

They continued to see each other for the next decade. He
always insisted she use flavoured condoms, she recalled.

Despite using protection, she became concerned for her own
health while the former Virginia Tech standout was sued in 2010 for allegedly
giving a woman herpes.

Back on top: Mr Vick was briefly back on top of the world as a starting quarterback with another $100million contract signed only two years ago with the Eagles

On the outs: Mr Vick struggled mightily this year and was benched in favor of a backup quarterback who appears to have taken the starting role from him

The mistress tested negative, and Mr Vick denied having the
STD despite settling with the woman out of court. He hinted at the time that he
threw money at the accuser to keep her quiet because he had much bigger fish to
fry.

The Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting operation would bring him
crashing down to earth only two years later.

The mistress also detailed group sex parties that saw the
star player bring hordes of women to his home to have sex with friends – with
him and Bella Escritor watching.

‘Once we returned to his house, we would separate and watch
the others partake in sex sessions throughout the mansion,’ she wrote,
according to RadarOnline.

‘Vick and I would sometimes crawl on the floors and sneak
into people’s bedrooms together and watch them having sex’ until they were
caught and would run out.

The relationship came to a dramatic ending when the former
first overall pick’s wife contacted Bella, she immediately confessed to
everything.

‘I knew it was over for Vick and me the moment I decided to
talk woman-to-woman with [his other girl],’ she wrote. ‘Somehow I felt a sense
of relief.’

The former mistress said she doesn’t regret meeting the
polarizing player, but doubts she’d do it all over
again.
