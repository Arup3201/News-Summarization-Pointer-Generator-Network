A film fan has combined his love for the big screen and his passion for cars to create a fleet of iconic vehicles from the movies, including the Batmobile and Herbie.

After building cars for almost 30 years, Jerry Patrick, from Newnan, Georgia, grew bored with the usual Mustangs and Camaros.

So he decided to test his skills on some unique vehicles which have gone down in movie and TV history.

Jerry Patrick, a car enthusiast from Newnan, Georgia, has created amazingly accurate replicas of iconic vehicles such as the Batmobile

Jerry has been building cars for the last three decades, but a few years ago he got bored with the usual Camaros and Mustangs, so he decided to test his skills on a different type of car

Now his garage houses accurate 
replicas of iconic cars like KITT from Knight Rider, Scooby Doo’s 
Mystery Machine and the Batmobile.

A few years ago, Jerry Patrick decided 
it would be a great idea to combine his love for cars with his passion 
for films, so he started building functional replicas of some of the 
most popular vehicles from the movie and TV over the decades.

Starting his search for old cars on 
eBay, Craiglist or by word of mouth, Jerry then gets to work on them, 
transforming them from shells into dream rides that movie buffs would 
snap up in a second.

Jerry's collection also includes Herbie the Love Bug, a 1963 Volkswagen Beetle

David Hasselhoff is sure to be impressed with this replica of KITT, the artificially intelligent and nearly indestructible car which helped him fight crime in TV show Knight Rider

'We've been doing cars off and on for the last 25 to 30 years and it came a time that we had seen enough Camaros and Mustangs at car shows and it was time to bring out some iconic stuff that people could actually touch and feel,' Jerry said when speaking to wsbtv.com. 

Jerry's collection includes replicas 
of Herbie the Love Bug, KITT from Knight Rider and the car driven by 
Danny Zuko in Grease's famous race scene.

His Batmobile is the most impressive of the extensive fleet and is always guaranteed to turn heads wherever it goes.

Complete with retractable machine guns, it also pumps fire and smoke out the back.

Fans of the John Travolta and Olivia Newton John hit movie Grease will recognise this car, which was raced along Thunder Road at the end of the film

A copy of Ford Mustang Eleanor from Gone in 60 Seconds has pride of place in Jerry's garage. Eleanor is the only Ford Mustang to receive a star title credit in a movie

Jerry's version took three years to
build. All aspects are custom made and it is almost identical to the original.

And it's not just for show, you can actually drive it, although Jerry says it's not easy.

'That Batmobile is a little bit harder to get out on the street for the simple reason there are so many people just taking videos and pictures and it's hard to change lanes, it's hard to speed up or slow down,' Jerry said.

'We normally have to have a chase vehicle (in) front, back and sides of it just to keep everything safe.

Heads are often turned when they see Jerry's Batmobile and The Mystery Machine driving around the street of Newnan

The experienced builder juggles between 25 to 35 cars at one time as his projects usually require parts from multiple vehicles to create the finished replica

Jerry puts as much effort into the interiors of the cars as he does the exteriors, as you can see from the inside of The Mystery Machine

'Of course if we drive it, we try and keep the machine guns down inside the car.'

The experienced builder is often 
juggling between 25 to 35 cars at one time as his projects usually 
require parts from multiple vehicles to create the finished product.

So which movie will provide Jerry with his next burst of inspiration? His upcoming projects include Mater from the movie Cars, an A-Team van and Bumblebee from Transformers.

Building the replicas mostly for fun, Jerry says he loves the reaction from kids and film fans.

He also carries out custom work for clients to help pay the bills.

But his labour of love is not always easy, especially when it comes to getting parts for unique cars.

He said: 'It's hard to go to Walmart and buy parts for the Batmobile. So you end up making everything for it.'
