He's one of the most reviled tyrants in world history, whose perverse doctrines and atrocities revealed some of human nature's ugliest aspects.

So it's fair to say Adolf Hitler is no one's idea of a brand ambassador.

But in this bizarre prototype advert, the Nazi leader makes a 'blink and you'll miss it' appearance that leaves a lasting impression.

Setting the scene: At the start of the advert, viewers are unaware the action takes place in Hitler's hometown, or who the boy flying the kite really is

Stopping short: The clip shows Mercedes smart breaking technology off as the car reacts quickly to a pair of schoolgirls who run into the road

Not just any boy: The film changes tone when the young Hitler chases his kite into the road and the Mercedes smart car takes a very different approach to his safety

The campaign is created around the slogan 'Mercedes: Detects dangers before they happen'.

Instead of just alerting the driver when an unseen obstacle appears, the smart car is shown to preempt the damage a young Adolf Hitler will do in the future.

Film students  Tobias Haase, Jan Mettler and Lydia Lohse from South Germany put the advert together to play on the Mercedes theme and apply the idea of a car's smart technology to human scenarios.

Tobias Haase said: 'Mercedes sells its 
cars on smart technology that prevents accidents from happening.

'We 
wanted to pose the question of what might happen if technology had a 
soul.'

The one minute video is set in a sleepy hamlet where men are digging potatoes in a misty field and children play on rural roads.

A sleek Mercedes rolls into the village and uses it's technologically advanced brakes to stop short of a pair of young girls who hopscotch across its path.

Sleek: The film students wanted the commercial to ask 'what might happen if technology had a soul?'

Infamous: When the camera pulls out, the names of the village is revealed. Braunau-am-Inn is the Austrian town where Adolf Hitler was born

In the next scene a young boy flying a kite runs into the road and is struck by the car, which does not brake or swerve.

The boy's mother, who is hanging laundry, screams 'Adolf' and the face of Adolf Hitler is flashed onto the screen.

The young boy is left sprawled on the ground, his limbs forming the outline of a swastika and the name of the village Braunau-am-Inn- Hitler's birthplace- is revealed.

Germany's Spiegel Magazine praised the inventive short film for pushing the boundaries of what a viewer expects from advertising.

Symbolic: After the film's credits run an image of the boy sprawled on the ground in the shape of a swastika hammers home the film's message

Controversial: the film students had to distance themselves from the brand, who are said to be displease by the spoof advert. They built the footage around Mercedes' message 'Detects dangers before they come up'

They said: 
'What would the world think if machines have a soul? Where could it 
lead, if technology makes decisions about life and death?

'May a powerful six-cylinder car 
change the history of the world?Â  This is a funny video with lingering 
criticism of technology - the filmakers have really earned their 
diplomas.'

The students were forced to put disclaimers on the video, saying: 'This is a film school's submission. There exists no past or current affiliation to Mercedes Benz or Daimler AG'.
