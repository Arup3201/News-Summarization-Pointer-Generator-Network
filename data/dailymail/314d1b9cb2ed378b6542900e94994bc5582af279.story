A mother and her two-year-old daughter were seriously hurt when a Holden Commodore ran into them and two other women on a footpath in Belmore on Sunday afternoon.

Peter Boslikouski, 50, was denied bail at Newtown Local Court on Monday, where it was alleged he had smoked ice and stayed awake for three days before the crash.

A mother and her two-year-old daughter were seriously hurt when a Holden Commodore ran into them and two other women on a footpath in Belmore on Sunday afternoon 

Peter Boslikouski, 50, was denied bail at Newtown Local Court on Monday, where it was alleged he had smoked ice and stayed awake for three days before the crash 

It was also alleged he tried to pretend he wasn't the driver when police arrived.

'Mr Boslikouski tried to disguise the fact that he was driving,' Magistrate Robert Williams said.

The 23-year-old mother's condition has improved to serious but stable and her daughter, who suffered head injuries, is in a serious condition at the Sydney Children's Hospital.

The two other women, 21 and 49, are listed as stable.

Police were called to Canterbury Road about 2.40pm on Sunday after receiving reports Boslikouski had crashed along the footpath and struck the pedestrians. 

It is believed the little girl was thrown from her pram when the car hit.

Boslikouski, from Bass Hill, was taken to hospital to be treated and was charged when he was released at 2.45am on Monday morning. 

He was charged with numerous offences, including three counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm.

Inspector Rick Agius from NSW Police told reporters that the event was 'tragic'.

'It's tragic. Tragic for the family and the child,' he said. 

'People think they're safe on the footpath walking along with a young child.'

During a bail hearing on Monday morning, he offered a $10,000 surety and said he would live with his brother and stick to whatever curfew the court wished to impose.

The court heard he had strong community ties and two children he visits regularly.

The prosecution opposed bail, which was denied by Mr Williams.

'The nature of the offence is serious,' the magistrate said.

Boslikouski is due to appear at Central Local Court on March 9 via audio visual link.

Crash investigators remained and the scene and motorists were advised to avoid the area
