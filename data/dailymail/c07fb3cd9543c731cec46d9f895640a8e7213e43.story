One abandoned calf was discovered in Virginia in April of 2013 with crippling frostbite on his back legs and tail. After having his legs amputated and being given a set of prosthetic ones, miraculously he can walk again.

Hero the calf was rushed to Kitty Martin's Selah Ranch All Animal Rescue in Greenville, VA with frostbite so severe that he had to lose his hind legs. KAGS TV reports that Kitty contacted talented veterinarians all over the region so that the injured calf could be nursed back to health.

After many vets turned Kitty down, she finally heard from Texas A&M's vet school.

The calf was moved from Virginia to College Station, Texas in November and was in terrible condition when he arrived. This is the first time Texas A & M ever put prosthetic legs on a large animal reports Yahoo.com.

'We got totally healthy skin to cover the whole bottom of the stump. We also were able to bring the tendons around so that we had a nice cushion so that it wasn't bone on skin touching the prosthetic,'said Dr. Ashlee Watts, assistant professor of Large Animal Surgery at Texas A & M.  

At first Kitty Martin thought that Hero may need to be put down. She began to love Hero 'more than any other animal' she'd ever met and decided that no matter what the outcome, she would need to try her luck.

'I loved him that much to take a chance' she told KAGS TV.

Miraculously, Hero survived, thanks to the heroes at A & M University who were willing to risk the never before executed procedure on a large animal, reported the New York Daily News.

Martin is happier than ever that her beloved friend Hero can walk again. She wants Hero to work with injured veterans and children because she feels as though he will be an inspiration to them.

'I'm amazed and I'm pleased and this is the best dadgum school in the world in my opinion,' said Kittty Martin.

Martin has plans for Hero saying, 'I'm just excited for his future. I want him to work with wounded warriors and children with special needs. I think everything he's been through and the spirit that he's come through everything. I think he'd be an encouragement to people,' she continued.

Hero has most certainly been an inspiration to her.
