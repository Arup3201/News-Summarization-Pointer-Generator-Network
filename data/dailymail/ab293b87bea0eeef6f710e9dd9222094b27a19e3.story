A thug who attacked a soldier from Prince Harry’s air base with a 'cowardly' gang who robbed and beat him unconscious has been jailed for more than three years.

Mitchell Ambrose, 20, of Ipswich, Suffolk, took part in the assault on 21-year-old Jack Shilton - who had served in Afghanistan - along with four other gang members who were jailed two months ago.

Ambrose was also sentenced for a ‘mindless drunken vandalism’ spree four months before the attack on the Army Air Corps serviceman, who maintains Apache helicopters at RAF Wattisham.

Brutal: The gang demanded soldier Jack Shilton, 21, to hand over his wallet before attacking him in Ipswich

Violent: A court heard how the gang acted like a 'pack of wolves' as they beat Mr Shilton, 21, to the ground

Shilton was punched in the face and kicked in the head by the five yobs who stole his wallet and phone in Ipswich on June 6 last year. He lay knocked out on the path after the late-night onslaught.

The louts were then seen ‘bumping fists’ as if they were proud of what they had done, the court was told. He suffered a bruised kidney, lumps on his head and suspected broken ribs in the incident.

Jailing four of the men at Ipswich Crown Court in November - before Ambrose was also sentenced yesterday - Judge Rupert Overbury said they acted like ‘a pack of wolves determined on its prey’.

The judge said there was an ‘element of degradation’ as one of the thugs booted Mr Shilton as he was slumped helpless on the ground and another dragged him along the road by his underwear.

Matthew Kersey (left), 30, admitted robbing the soldier and assaulting his friend, and was jailed for 32 months. Jamie Duncan (right), 23, admitted robbery and was jailed for 30 months

Judge Overbury told the gang: ‘While your victim has served this country, your country, in Afghanistan, to protect you and the rest of us from the threat of future harm, you have behaved in a cowardly and despicable fashion.

'(You were) a pack of wolves determined on its prey'

Judge Rupert Overbury

‘Each of you is a disgrace to your family and a disgrace to your community.’

Jerran Hart, 22, and Adam Poulter, 26, denied robbing Mr Shilton, but were found guilty after a trial. Poulter was jailed for three years and nine months and Hart for three years and six months.

Matthew Kersey, 30, admitted robbing Mr Shilton and assaulting his friend Peter Scott, and was jailed for 32 months. Jamie Duncan, 23, admitted robbery and was jailed for 30 months.

'Cowards': The five men then continued to attack Mr Shilton as he lay defenceless on the ground in Ipswich

Injuries: Mr Shilton was left with a bruised kidney and several suspected broken ribs from the assault

Yesterday Ambrose was sentenced to 32 months of detention in a young offenders’ institution for the robbery, which he had admitted.

He was also given eight months to run consecutively for five offences of theft and one of criminal damage committed last February, which he also admitted.

Paul Donegan, defending, said Ambrose had been on the edge of the attack on Mr Shilton, adding: ‘He is young and has behaved foolishly and badly.’

Apache pilot Prince Harry was based at RAF Wattisham, near Ipswich, between 2011 and 2012.
