Three dogs were killed after a swarm of bees attacked and stung them to death in the backyard of a Santa Ana home where they lived.

The animals' owner, Linnea Chapman, found her Australian Shepherds, Bartlett, Bailey, and Remy dead in the backyard and covered in bees on Tuesday night.

The swarm of Africanized honey bees had made a large hive inside of an old cabinet in their neighbors' backyard, and the bees had become angry from the dogs barking and attacked, according to Santa Ana Animal Services.

On Tuesday night, Linnea (pictured above) came home from grocery shopping when she found it odd the dogs were not barking as usual

'It's surreal. It is heartbreaking. It's devastating,' said Linnea. 

Animal Services said this was the first time there had been a fatal attack like this in Santa Ana, according to KTLA. 

On Tuesday night, Linnea had come home from grocery shopping when she suspected something was wrong when she did not hear the dogs barking.

She went into her backyard with a flashlight which is when she first found the oldest dog, Bartlett, and was shocked.

The city's animal control officers were able to trace the swarm of bees to the hive inside the cabinet of the next door neighbors

She said: 'I went out and stumbled across the first one. I couldn't believe it. I said, 'Wake up. Wake up' and then I saw the second and then the third.'

Linnea and her husband, who do not have children, grieved the loss of their beloved pets who were like family, and who they had owned since they were puppies, according to NBC Los Angeles. 

The dogs had been barking at the pool cleaner which agitated the bees. They eventually attacked and stung the animals, said Sondra Berg from Santa Ana Animal Services.

Bee Busters, a private bee specialist, has since removed the hive (pictured above dead bees from the hive)

She also said there were thousands of bees found in the backyard. 

The city's animal control officers were able to trace the swarm of bees to the hive in the backyard of the Chapmans' elderly neighbors, which was near to where the dogs' bodies were found, according to police. 

Bee Busters, a private bee specialist, has since been called to the neighbors' home to remove the hive.

Linnea plans to have necropsies performed on the dogs so she can learn exactly how they passed away.
