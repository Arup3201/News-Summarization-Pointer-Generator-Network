The company was founded by husband and wife team Helen and Stewart Mackechnie in 2003. 

Mrs Mackechnie, 35 said: 'I can't believe it.

'It is a lovely feeling, just because we started from absolutely nothing. It will be our 11th birthday next month.

'We got a really good response on Facebook, we got a lot of congratulations from customers.' 

A visit to the Margaret River Chocolate Company in Perth, Western Australia inspired the couple to start their own business.
