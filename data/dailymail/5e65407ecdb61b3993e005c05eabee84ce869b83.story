We’ve all been seduced by beautifully shot images of fast food. 

But those pictures of fat juicy burgers, succulent tomatoes and crisp lettuce encased in a perfectly toasted seeded bun are more a triumph of marketing and styling than they are of cooking and taste. 

These tricks of food styling are the subject of Sydney-based videographer Minhky Le's trio of short films, Real Food But Not Really.

The videos offer insights into the glaring contrast between home-prepared foods versus foods primed by a food stylist.

Mr Le, who is also a graphic designer, took a two-day food styling course by world renowned food stylist Denise Vivaldo before he started work on his videos. 

'Through the use of food dyes, cotton-ball stuffing, imitation ice, and an array of other clever devices, these films explore the many trickeries we are ever presented with by commercial industries in our everyday lives,' he writes on his website, Whisk Films. 

Picture perfect: Sydney-based videographer Minhky Le's Real Food but Not Really series exposes the food styling tricks that industry insiders use to make food seem more appealing to would-be customers

Comprised of two segments, the first parts of the films are shot in black and white and show the conventional method of foods being cooked or assembled. 

The second segment - showcasing insider food styling tricks -  are shot in vivid colour.

The first film, Something Savoury focuses on the perfect fast food - the burger. 

The film starts in black and white and shows how a burger cooked and assembled at home is made. 

The camera then moves to the food styling  and it’s a real eye opener.

Lingering over each shot, the second segment starts with a perfect bun being carefully sliced length ways.  

A crinkled paper is placed on top of the bun so that the juices from the burger don’t seep into the bread and make it soggy.

Then a burger patty is touched to a sizzling pan and its sides caressed by the heat before swiftly being removed from the fire.

Next rectangular skewer is heated with a blowtorch, which is then carefully pressed into the top of the burger, to make the all-important grill marks.

The burger is then stroked with brush dipped in brown icing colour. This is done to make it appear more cooked than it actually is.

Lettuce is gently placed on top of the lightly seared burger and held together with drawing pins so the leaves of the vegetable cascade attractively from the sides of the bun.

Tomatoes are then artfully draped over the lettuce and also secured with drawing pins so that there are no unattractive bulges. Next come gherkins, sliced lengthways and layered on top of the tomatoes and lettuce.

Cotton wool balls are placed behind the assembly of vegetables to present an illusion of height, before the top half of the sesame seed bun is finally placed on top.

Using a syringe, ketchup is then squirted in the crevices between the burger, buns and vegetables.

A shot of the highly stylised product next to the home-cooked burger demonstrates the stark contrast between the first creation and the second.

The second video focuses on sweet and demonstrates the method behind a flawless ice-cream cone. 

Once again the first segment highlights the unstylised product. Ice-cream is unceremoniously scraped from the tub before being smooshed into a conventional cone. Strawberry sauce is drizzled on top of it before sprinkles are added to the sweet treat.

In the food styling segment, it’s a whole different matter. 

A combination of vanilla frosting and soft icing sugar are folded together in a bowl to create faux 'ice-cream'.

Then a scoop of the ice-cream' is moulded and shaped to the top of a  cone.

Strawberry sauce is applied via a syringe to the top of the cone before a before a spill of sprinkles is applied on top of the sauce.

The final video debunking advertised images goes even further. This time it’s sparkling drinks that get the treatment.

In the stylised section, masking tape is wrapped around the top of a glass before a layer of strong hair gel is smeared on the surface of the glass. 

Glycerin is then sprayed from an angle; its drops resembling condensation on a glass.

The glass is filled with fake ice cubes and soda water. Drops of pillar box red food colouring come next before the concoction is swirled to create a reddish drink.

Finally the masking tape is removed from the top of the glass and a cocktail umbrella perched on an ice cube.
