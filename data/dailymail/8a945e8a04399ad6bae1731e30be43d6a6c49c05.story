Fielding annoying questions from relatives during the holidays is pretty much unavoidable, but one cocky teenager has come up with an inventive solution to silence those annoying relatives by handing them a pamphlet of pre-prepared answers.

When Arianna Simon, a 17-year-old from Rockland, New York, sat down for Thanksgiving last month she proceeded to hand out her carefully printed hand-out which included answers to the boring generic questions that she just wasn't prepared to answer at the dinner table.

The leaflet covered hot topics for the teenager including what college she might attend, if she has a boyfriend and her age.

The three-page pamphlet was entitled 'Frequently asked questions' and included a smiling pic of Arianne looking her best on the front cover.

Inside was a message explaining the purpose behind the hand-out. 'If you refrain from asking me these questions that I have nicely provided you the answers to, we will have a happy and loving thanksgiving. Thank you,' she wrote.

Arianna then went on to answer the boring questions with a certain amount of sass. For instance in answer to questions about she age she wrote: 'I turned 17 in October.. yes, I know time flies. I have also gotten taller, that happens when you grow up.'

The original idea came from her mom she recent explained.

'I was talking to my mom about how much I hate answering the same five questions over and over during the holidays, so she hinted that I just make a handout for my family,' the teen told The Huffington Post. 'She was beyond shocked when I actually followed through with her idea.'

Arianna produced her debut pamphlet just before Thanksgiving dinner and it seemed to go down a winner.

'When I handed them out on Thanksgiving, it was more of a gag joke than anything else. Everyone thought the idea was great and took it well,' she explained.

'I was surprised though, because I didn't have anything to talk about with some family members! Overall, I think the pamphlet was a hit and I loved not talking about the same things.'

The reaction was so good in fact that she has another handout planned for the dinner table on Christmas Day.

'During the holiday season, most teens get stuck answering the same questions over and over again,' she told The Stir. 

'I realize that some people are genuinely interested in what you have to say, but sometimes I find that these generic questions are just used to fill the silences. I love talking to my family members, but I feel like so much time is wasted while answering repetitive questions.'

Once they move past the generic pleasantries, Simon hopes that she and her relatives will be able to move on to more enjoyable and substantial topics.

The idea proved such a hit for Arianna at Thanksgiving that she will be handing out more pamphlets round the table on Christmas Day
