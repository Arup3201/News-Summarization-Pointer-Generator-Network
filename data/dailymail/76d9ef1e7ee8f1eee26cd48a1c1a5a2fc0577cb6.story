I do: The moment Harald Six, 21, from Gent in Belgium asked his girlfriend to marry him 2,300ft high in scenic Norwegian spot

Harald with his girlfriend Hanna Troch, 22, who challenged him to propose in the most original way possible

Determined not to let her down, Harald  asked her to marry him on the edge of a scenic ledge on the spectacular Trolltunga in Odda, Norway, 2,300 ft high.

The Trolltunga is a piece of rock which juts horizontally out of a mountain  in the Skjeggedal area, near to the villages of Tyssedal and the Sørfjorden. It overlooks lake Ringedalsvatnet and its translated name means 'the troll's tongue'.

The couple plan to get married in August.

Harald said: 'She made clear she wanted an original marriage proposal when it came to being asked.

Harald said, 'We smiled and people were clapping - it was the most amazing moment of my life, on the most amazing spot I had ever been'

'When we were up there I warned her to stay calm.

'I took her hand and got her away from the edge as I went on one knee.

'It seemed like never ending seconds before she said yes.

'We smiled and people were clapping - it was the most amazing moment of my life, on the most amazing spot I had ever been.'
