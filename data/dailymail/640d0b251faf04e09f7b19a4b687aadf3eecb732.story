Knut, the 'celebrity polar bear' who became a household name before his tragic death at Berlin Zoo two years ago, is poised to make his comeback from beyond the grave.

Photos released this week show the former polar bear in the process of getting stuffed before becoming a resident at Berlin's Natural History Museum next week.

Knut was just four year old when he suffered a brain aneurism in his enclosure at Berlin Zoo in March 2011, toppled into the water of his enclosure, and drowned. It was a tragic end for a creature who once captivated the world.

Famous forever: A taxidermist is preparing the mold for Knut's remains to be stuffed before it goes on display at Berlin's Natural History Museum.

Knut was rejected by his mother at birth and raised by his keeper Thomas Doerflein. Resembling a real-life teddy, the polar cub quickly shot to world wide fame and his fluffy white face even grazed the cover of Vanity Fair.

The daily shows of Thomas feeding Knut attracted visitors from as far away as Siberia and he quickly became addicted to the lime light, playing it up for the cameras.

However Knut became increasingly dependent on the spotlight and the visitors' attention as he began the weaning off from Mr Doerflein.

When Mr Doerflein suddenly died from a heart attack in 2008, Knut became withdrawn and depressed.

Papa bear: Knut was 'adopted' by keeper Thomas Doerflein, and struggled when staff tried to wean him off his human 'father' and sunk into depression when Doerflein died in 2008

Fame fix: Knut loved the public as much as they loved him, something which became an addiction and led to him being branded 'psycho bear' by experts

He would only become animated when cameras were clicking and adoring crowds were waiting at the railings of his enclosure.

Even Knut's final moment were captured by visitors. Suffering a brain aneurysm in his enclosure, the adoring crowds saw him stand, stagger and finally topple into the water to meet his watery end.

Now, two years after his death, he is ready to make a comeback as taxidermists finish six months of preparations of his cadaver.

He will go on display from February 16 until March 15 when he will be archived until a permanent Knut exhibition opens in 2014.
