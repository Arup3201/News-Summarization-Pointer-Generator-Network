Roberto Soldado and Erik Lamela, two players with plenty of points to prove at White Hart Lane this season, each found the target as Tottenham thrashed Celtic 6-1 in Helsinki on Saturday.

It was Lamela’s third goal in four pre-season matches under Mauricio Pochettino as Spurs extended their unbeaten build-up with another impressive performance.

Harry Kane, Lewis Holtby, Christian Eriksen and Emmanuel Adebayor, making his first appearance after missing Tottenham’s tour of the US with malaria, were also on target.

Back on track: Soldado celebrates scoring for Tottenham against Celtic

It rounded off a dismal week for Celtic — their Champions League qualification hopes are hanging by a thread following Wednesday’s 4-1 humbling by Legia Warsaw — and Pochettino admitted he expected more from the Scottish champions.

‘I was hoping for a stronger test,’ he said. ‘We brought a strong squad but it was still a worthwhile game. It wasn’t a waste of time, sometimes these games are more difficult because young players try harder in friendlies.’

New Celtic boss Ronny Deila fielded what was essentially a development side and assistant John Collins defended Celtic’s team selection. ‘The bottom line is the game was arranged in February before we arrived,’ he said. ‘It’s fallen between big European games, so circumstances dictate we come out here with a really young team.’

Point to prove: Erik Lamela impressed for Spurs netting their fourth goal in the 6-1 thrashing over Celtic

Not that any of that will have concerned Lamela, who is desperate to catch the eye of Pochettino after an injury-hit first year at the club.Signed for £25.7million from Roma 12 months ago, the forward made just three league starts under Andre Villas-Boas and then Tim Sherwood, fuelling speculation that he could be sold.

Soldado, too, had a forgettable first year in north London with only six goals following his £26m move from Valencia.

Both appear to be very much part of new boss Pochettino’s plans, however. Spurs led 2-0 thanks to efforts from frontmen Kane and Soldado in the fourth and 11th minutes respectively.

Jamie Lindsay pulled a goal back for Celtic in the 43rd, but Holtby, who spent the second half of last season on loan at Fulham, restored the two-goal cushion and Lamela made it 4-1 just before the hour mark.

An Eriksen free-kick and Adebayor’s penalty sealed the rout in the last 10 minutes, while Celtic’s misery was compounded by a red card for Efe Ambrose — his second this week, having been dismissed at Legia Warsaw — for a foul on Adebayor.
