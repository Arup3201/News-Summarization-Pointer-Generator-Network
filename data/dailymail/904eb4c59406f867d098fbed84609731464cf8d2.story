Scientists have discovered that Martian meteorites found on Earth could be four billion years younger than previously thought, meaning that Mars could still be geologically active.

A team of researchers has shown that a meteorite from the Mars collection at the Royal Ontario Museum in Canada started as a 200 million-year-old lava flow on Mars.

In a paper published today in the journal Nature, a new technique using isotopic and micro-structural analysis is described to determine the age of rocks. 

Following recent analysis, scientists claim that martian rocks found on earth left Mars 20 million years ago. Previously it was thought the rocks could be up to 4,000 million years old

Scientists from the University of Portsmouth, the Royal Ontario Museum, the University of Wyoming and the University of California, claim that the rocks left Mars 20 million years ago.

Previously it was thought the rocks could be up to 4,000 million years old.

‘There has been a long debate about the actual age of precious Martian rocks that have been found on Earth,’ said James Darling, from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Portsmouth.

‘Some scientists suggested they were formed as part of the ancient Martian crust and are therefore around 4,000 million years old - almost as old as the solar system itself. And others believed they were much younger.’

The meteorites found on Earth have been ejected from Mars, probably after being dislodged by a large meteorite impact, and have eventually been hoovered up by Earth.

This process can cause extensive damage to the samples, including deformation and melting of the crystals that make up the rock.

‘The real challenge has been interpreting whether the measured age of the rock is the time at which it was formed or the time at which it was ejected from the Martian surface’, said Darling.

The team used a number of high resolution techniques to analyse the Martian crystals, examining samples much smaller than a human hair.

The researchers combined isotopic 
analysis with micro-structural analysis, which means they looked at both
the structure of the crystals and the chemistry to determine the growth
history of the crystals.

James Darling, from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Portsmouth, said the study is exciting not only because it provides a much better understanding of the geological activity on Mars, but the new technique can be used to analyse meteorites from the Moon and other asteroids

Darling said: ‘This is a really exciting study, not only because it gives us a much better understanding of the geological activity on Mars, but also because we can apply this new technique to meteorites from the Moon and other asteroids, which means we can start to analyse hundreds of rocks from the solar system.’

Nearly 100 meteorites found on Earth are thought to be from Mars.

They are kept in collections all over
the world and are hugely valuable scientifically as they provide 
researchers with unique insights into the history of the red planet.

The scientists analysed a shergottite meteorite found in north Africa, which is kept at the Royal Ontario Museum.

Snow on ancient Mars is the most likely reason for the network of valleys that exist there, according to American scientists. 

Researchers at Brown University have shown that some Martian valleys appear to have been caused by runoff from orographic precipitation- moisture carried part of the way up a mountain and deposited on the slopes.

Scientists studied four different locations on Mars that they suspected had water-carved valleys, caused by snow or rainfall when moist prevailing winds are pushed upward by mountain ridges.

The new findings, published in Geophysical Research Letters, are the most detailed evidence yet of an orographic effect on ancient Mars and could shed new light on the planet's early climate and atmosphere.
