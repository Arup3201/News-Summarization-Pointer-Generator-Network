Vicky Pryce yesterday publicly accused her ex-husband Chris Huhne of effectively forcing her to take his speeding points because she was his wife.

Pryce, 59, will use a rarely employed piece of legislation to claim she was the victim of 'marital coercion' when the former Cabinet minister was allegedly caught by a motorway speed camera.

The pair are at war over a driving penalty which Liberal Democrat  Huhne, 57, allegedly dodged after he was caught speeding in 2003.

Serious business: Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce arrived at Southwark Crown Court to face charges that he persuaded her when they were married to lie about a speeding offence

Yesterday they appeared at Southwark 
Crown Court in London for a preliminary hearing. They are jointly 
charged with perverting the course of justice by covering up the 
offence.

Pryce's defence will allege that Huhne 'coerced' her into taking the penalty points.

Her lawyers will use an antiquated 
piece of legislation dating back to 1925 in which a wife can argue that 
she acted under duress due to the influence of her spouse.

The Criminal Justice Act of 1925 
states: 'On a charge against a wife for any offence other than treason 
or murder it shall be a good defence to prove that the offence was 
committed in the presence of, and under the coercion of, the husband.'

In a separate development, Huhne's 
lawyer announced that he would be seeking to dismiss the charge on the 
basis that there is no case for him  to answer.

The former Energy and Climate Change 
Secretary has hired barrister John Kelsey Fry, QC, who successfully 
defended Tottenham Hotspur manager Harry Redknapp against tax evasion 
charges earlier this year. He hopes to be exonerated within weeks.

Happier times: Chris Huhne allegedly persuaded his former partner Vicky Pryce, left, to take his penalty points for a speeding offence almost a decade ago

The disputed events date back to March
2003, when Huhne's car was caught by a speed camera on the motorway 
between Stansted airport in Essex and London.

It is alleged that Huhne, who at the 
time was a Member of the European Parliament, asked Pryce to take three 
speeding points so he could avoid a driving ban, meaning the pair 
subsequently lied to police about who was driving the car.

It was only after Huhne left his wife 
in June 2010 for his press agent Carina Trimingham, that newspaper 
stories alleged he had forced her to take penalty points on his behalf.

The explosive allegations led to the 
resignation of Huhne from the Cabinet earlier this year following an 
exhaustive eight-month police investigation which resulted in charges.

Allegations: The events which led to the charges date back to March 2003, when Huhne's car was allegedly caught by a speed camera on the motorway between Stansted Airport in Essex and London

The indictment against them states 
that between March 12 and May 21, 2003, Huhne and Pryce 'with intent to 
pervert the course of public justice did an act which had a tendency to 
pervert the course of justice'.

Yesterday Huhne stared straight ahead 
at the judge, ignoring his ex-wife, who seemed tense, leaning forward in
her seat throughout the hearing.

Even though they were forced to share 
the dock, such is the bitter acrimony between the man and woman who were
married for 26 years that they could barely stand to look at each 
other.

Huhne, who was dressed in a dark suit 
and maroon tie, took his seat at the opposite end of the dock to Pryce 
as their barristers outlined how they planned to fight the charges.

Pryce, who was dressed in a beige 
linen jacket and a brown knee-length skirt, entered a plea of not guilty
to the single charge of perverting the course of justice yesterday.

Huhne's arraignment was adjourned for an application to dismiss the charge.

Both defendants were remanded on unconditional bail until a pre-trial hearing on a date to be fixed.

They are due to face a trial on October 2.
