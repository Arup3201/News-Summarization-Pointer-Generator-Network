With Apple's new handsets going on sale Friday, experts are warning customers against buying fake and knock-off iPhones by highlighting some of the techniques criminals use to dupe them.

The Counterfeit Report explains what to look for when buying an Apple product, including the Designed by Apple in California stamp, and how to check the product is an official design using Apple's services and warranty checker.

Fake iPhones and chargers have recently been linked with a spate of accidents as well as a death in China, where counterfeit Apple products are rife.

According to The Counterfeit Report, customers who think they have a fake handset should compare it with a friend's iPhone. The site adds that some fake handsets are sold in authentic iPhone boxes, pictured, so the serial number on the box should be checked on Apple's official support site

In the left-hand image, a fake iPhone is shown pictured left, next to an official device, right. In the right-hand image, the official iPhone, bottom, is much thinner than the fake handset, top, and has a join in the casing

Official handsets will come with a serial number printed on the rear of the device.

This serial number can be entered into Apple's Service and Support Checker to confirm a phone's authenticity.

An official box is not an indication of an official phone - boxes can be recycled.

Check for the Designed by Apple in California stamp.

Only buy from official retailers.

According to the Counterfeit Report : 'When you buy from a internet site, and not from an authentic Apple dealer, you risk buying a cheap Chinese knockoff.

'If you think you have a fake, just compare it to your friend's iPhone.

'The processor speed, touchscreen and feel should be identical.'

The site continues that an authentic-looking iPhone box is 'not an indication of an authentic Apple iPhone 4' and explains some counterfeiters will package fake phones in official packaging to convince buyers of its authenticity. 

Elsewhere, the site states that each iPhone has a unique serial number.

To check whether a serial number has been forged, repeated, or if an old box with an old serial number has been used with the knock-off handset, customers can type the number into Apple's support site.

The Service and Support Checker will confirm if a handset is the real-deal or not. 

A serial number is found on the rear of the phone's box, on an official receipt, or on the rear of the device.

Earlier this year, Apple in China posted 
instructions on how to tell an official power adapter from a fake one, 
after a number of iPhone owners claimed to have been electrocuted by their handsets.

The
page showed images of chargers for each Apple device, including the 
iPhone 5 and the iPad 2, with the official, relevant safety notices underneath.

As well as recycling official packaging, counterfeiters will also recycle official serial numbers. These Apple iPhone boxes pictured appear to be the real-deal but the IMEI numbers, highlighted, are repeated

Apple in China recently posted instructions on how to tell an official power adapter from a fake one, after a number of iPhone owners claimed to have been electrocuted by their handsets

Apple's new iPhone 5C, pictured, goes on sale Friday. The advice given by The Counterfeit Report applies to all Apple handsets

The
electrocutions took place in the Chinese cities of Beijing and 
Xinjian, putting one man into a coma and killing another woman.

The site reads: 'This overview will help you identify genuine Apple USB power adapter.

'When you need to charge the iPhone or iPad, we recommend that you use the standard USB power adapter and USB cable.'

All iPhone and iPads are sold with official Apple chargers, although fake replacements can be bought online.

The Counterfeit Report also explains how to spot fake USB chargers, Xbox games, Sony flash drives and Nikon camera batteries, among other electronics.

It additionally lets users report fake websites and products.

Although the site explains how to spot a fake iPhone 4, the techniques counterfeiters use are the same across models and apply to more recent handsets, too.
