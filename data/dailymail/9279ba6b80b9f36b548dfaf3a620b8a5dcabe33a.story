Irish trainer Eddie Lynam goes in search of history with one of his all-conquering Power rangers in the £273,000 Group One Betfred Sprint Cup but this time his speedster might struggle to call the tune with Music Master in the field.

In a memorable summer, Lynam has won all four Group One sprints run this season with Slade Power (Diamond Jubilee Stakes and July Cup) and Sole Power (King’s Stand and Nunthorpe Stakes).

Another victory for Sole Power would give Lynam a unique clean sweep in Britain’s five Group One sprints but to achieve the feat Sole Power must do what he has never done – win over six furlongs.

Clean sweep: Eddie Lynam is looking for his fifth Group one sprint victory of the season 

Sole Power, the 7-2 favourite, is arguably in the form of his life and drying conditions play to his strengths but it cannot be ignored that all 10 of the seven-year-old gelding’s wins have come over five furlongs,

All seven runs at six have ended in defeat and he finished 11th of 12 to Dream Ahead when running in this race in 2011.

His jockey Richard Hughes, architect of a daring hold-up effort in the Nunthorpe, may be expressing confidence about the trip but, with that stark statistic hanging over him, Sole Power has to be opposed.

The one to drain the Sole’s power could be Music Master (Haydock, 3.50), who was forced to miss the Nunthorpe when off-colour.

Most of this colt’s early races were over seven furlongs, including fifth in the Royal Ascot’s Jersey Stakes last year, but he has found his niche sprinting.

Win: Sole Power won at King's Stand and Nunthorpe Stakes, and could add a third at the Betfred Sprint Cup

His fourth to Slade Power in the Diamond Jubilee was all the more meritorious as he raced in a disadvantaged breakaway group and jockey Fergus Sweeney had to make a move sooner than he probably wanted.

In contrast, his latest win in Newbury’s Group Three Hackwood Stakes saw Music Master eat up the ground in the final furlong after being asked a big hold-up question.

His trainer Henry Candy may have made his name with middle distance stars like Master Willie and Time Charter but, in more recent times, sprinters like Kyllachy and Markab, winner of this race in 2010, have defined his career.

Candy said: ‘It’s maturity, a change of tactics and the trainer finally getting the right trip with Music Master.

‘He has been an absolute revelation this year. He looks nothing like a sprinter but it is amazing how he covers the ground.

Double: Slade Power, also trained by lynam,  won the Diamond Jubilee Stakes and July Cup

‘He didn’t give me any reason to think seven furlongs wasn’t right and then went to (Glorious) Goodwood last year and was drawn on the outside in a huge handicap.

‘Fergus had to use up a lot of horse to get into the right position. Two furlongs out, he looked like winning 10 lengths and then fell in a heap.

‘We messed about with cross nosebands and tongue ties but the answer was he was just getting faster as he was getting older.

‘If there similarities between this horse and Markab it is that they are both big horses and, therefore, rather by definition, likely to improve with time.’

Other potential improvers in the line-up are Cougar Mountain, Extortionist and G Force, all strong finishers in the Nunthorpe, the latter being particularly unlucky.

While the standard is set by last year’s winner, and 2012 runner-up, Gordon Lord Byron.
