She is playing a woman renowned as an icon of Hollywood glamour.

But with a khaki parka slung on over her nightgown, it appears Helena Bonham Carter doesn’t share Dame Elizabeth Taylor’s sense of timeless style.

Miss Bonham Carter, 46, who is known for her eccentric dress sense, was caught between scenes for forthcoming BBC drama Burton And Taylor, which charts the dying days of the late star’s turbulent relationship with Richard Burton.

Miss Bonham Carter, whose big-screen credits include Les Miserables, Alice In Wonderland and The King’s Speech, was spotted with co-star Dominic West, star of crime drama The Wire, who is playing Burton.

With his hair dyed grey and wearing a black tuxedo, Old Etonian West, 43, bore more of a similarity to seven-time Oscar-nominated actor Burton.

The couple were photographed between takes as they filmed scenes in Chiswick, West London, last week.

Burton And Taylor will be screened next year on BBC4. It is set in 1983, the year before Burton’s death, when he and Miss Taylor starred in a revival of Noel Coward’s Private Lives on Broadway.

The couple, who at the time were separated, played a divorced couple who meet again on honeymoon with their new partners.

Legendary couple: Richard Burton and Liz Taylor during a scene from the Broadway revival of Noel Coward's Private Lives.

Speaking about her role in the BBC drama, Miss Bonham Carter said: ‘I look nothing like her for a start but it’s about capturing the essence of them at a particular time.

She was and continues to be  a fascinating woman and she was a huge star. There’s no one comparable around now.’

Miss Taylor, who won two Oscars and starred in classics including Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, died in 2011.
