A thousand people braved freezing snow and ice in Estonia to take part in a bizarre competition to visit the most saunas in one day. 

Participants stripped down to swimsuits and underwear for the Otepaa Sauna Marathon, running around the city to enjoy as many saunas as possible in just six hours for a prize. 

After plunging in ice pools for extra points, they were rewarded with an open air bath in beer.

The competition attracted 1,000 people this year, with many dressing in costume for the occasion. 

It was the sixth time the festival was held, with entry to the competition free of charge. 

Participants are given a map to find their way to all of the listed saunas across the city and are required to stay in each place for at least three minutes. 

Last year's winners managed to cram in all of the stops in just over two hours, taking home a hot tub of their own as a prize. 

A select number of saunas take part, with owners required to mark off each team's charts when they arrive and leave. 

Thirty minutes is added to a team's finishing time for each of the stops they failed to make, with organisers shaving off ten minutes to hot tub visits if every member of the team takes a dip.

Prizes for second and third place included spa stays and hotel accommodation.  

Otepaa is a popular skiing resort with a population of around 2,000. Every year it attracts thousands of snow sport enthusiasts. 

Its wooden saunas are among the towns most popular attractions.
