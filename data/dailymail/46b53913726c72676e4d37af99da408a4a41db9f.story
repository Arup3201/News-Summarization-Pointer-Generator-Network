It was 30,000 police against one man. And while the former lost the battle, the latter lived to fight another day.

Supporters of controversial Godman Rampal faced the might of the security forces on Tuesday as a huge number of personnel, mostly from the Haryana Police, launched a massive assault on Satlok Ashram to arrest him.

Residents of Barwala in Hisar district, where the ashram is located, woke up to one of the bloodiest days of their lives as pitched battles were fought between the Sant’s supporters and the police. More than 200, including security and media personnel, were injured in the violence.

This came after the Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday reserved its judgement on cancellation of Rampal's bail in connection with a 2006 murder case. During the hearing, the amicus curiae pressed for immediate cancellation of his bail, saying the credibility of the entire judicial system would be at stake if his bail was not cancelled. 

The operation, which started around 11.45am and continued till late in the evening, failed as the self-styled Godman had put up a human shield of 70,000 followers, including women and children, around him, and managed to evade arrest. 

STILL HOLED UP

Sources said Rampal is still holed up inside his ashram, protected by a tight security cover of his followers. Ashram spokesman Raj Kapoor, meanwhile, has said that Rampal is “unwell” and is being treated at an “undisclosed location”. 

SP Hisar Satyendra Gupta gave an early indication to Rampal’s supporters who had gathered outside his ashram that the police were in no mood to negotiate with the Godman as his personnel tried to break the human shield. 

Tension mounted as supporters of Rampal refused to pay heed to repeated announcements by the police over loud speakers demanding entry to the premises so they could arrest him. 

Police then lobbed tear-gas shells and resorted to lathi-charge to disperse Rampal's supporters, who allegedly fired back and even threw fire bombs and acid.

Security forces tried to storm the back of the ashram to prevent injury to the godman's 'human shield' of followers, many of whom are women and children. Some supporters who left the fortress-like ashram claimed that people are being held inside against their will.

As the day progressed, security personnel made five attempts to enter the ashram, but failed at every turn. Injured policemen were taken to the regional health centre at Barwala. The seriously injured were taken to Hisar civil hospital and Rohtak PGI. Two policemen suffered bullet wounds. One woman sustained serious burn injuries, and it remains unclear how she sustained these, an official said. 

“They have assembled a huge cache of acid bottles which they are throwing at us from roof tops apart from stones and bottles of petrol,’ said Satpal Sangwan, an injured constable, while he was being taken for treatment. 

Another constable, Sunil Kumar, complained that  the operation remained unsuccessful as they were ordered not to open fire,

Media personnel also faced the brunt of the violence that left some of them injured, while the cameras of many electronic news channels were damaged. Police brutality has been reported against media covering the siege.

At one point, security personnel attempted to break into the ashram from the other side so that women and children who had formed the human chain were not injured in the operation.

Earth mover machines were used to break down the wall of the ashram. However, at the end of a five-hour effort, the wall was brought down only partially. 

Some disciples who managed to come out from the ashram claimed that thousands of people were still inside the premises and a vast majority of them wanted to leave immediately but were being prevented by lathi-wielding supporters of the ‘godman’. 

Kalawati Devi, a native of Satna in Madhya Pradesh, told Mail Today that she was willing to get out earlier, but that the Sant’s followers had held her seven-year-old daughter inside the ashram. She had been searching for her in vain all day.

The whole of Barwala town turned into a war zone, and the police did not allow even local residents to walk or ply vehicles on major roads. Only police, ambulances and fire tenders could be seen on the roads. 

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was also closely monitoring the situation and was being given constant updates, his OSD, Jawahar Yadav said in Chandigarh.

‘Rampal being targeted to please Arya Samajis’

With the Haryana Police struggling to arrest godman Sant Rampal at Hisar’s Satlok Ashram as his supporters guard him at the 12-acre ashram-turned-fortress, his followers on Tuesday alleged the crackdown was only to appease the upper caste Arya Samajis of the state. 

The ashram management alleged the police and administration have targeted Sant Rampal and his followers for 15 years, but let off Arya Samajis despite them attacking the ashram time and again. 

Satlok Ashram spokesperson Raj Kapoor on Tuesday told Mail Today by phone: “I am in the ashram. Followers, including women and children, are injured. There are four bodies of women before me. I want to ask the administration why we are only targeted and Rampal is not allowed video conferencing when the head of another sect can make over 100 video conference appearances?”

He claimed cases against Rampal are all fabricated and added that the previous government, during the tenure of which the cases were registered, almost tried to ‘finish’ Rampal. 

“Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, himself a follower of Arya Samaj, got the false cases registered. No action was taken against those who attacked the Satlok Ashram, but Hooda rewarded them with plum posts,” Kapoor said. 

Meanwhile, AAP leader Yogendra Yadav said on Tuesday that the Haryana government has been pursuing different policies for different Babas. He said the state government bowed before a baba facing criminal charges while it is acting against another. 

The AAP has demanded a judicial probe into Tuesday’s action, which left many journalists and Rampal’s followers injured. 

Haryana Director General of Police S. N. Vashisth on Tuesday said that the Haryana Police operation at Satlok Ashram will continue till Rampal is arrested. The DGP said that when the police team started the operation, the followers fired gunshots, pelted stones and threw acid bombs on the police personnel, due to which about 105 personnel were injured. 

“It is unfortunate that some journalists have been injured,” he added. 

The DGP said the police are taking every step very carefully to prevent any casualty. He added that phone calls from the ashram have revealed that many supporters have been forcibly kept inside. 

In reply to a question, Vashisth said that followers inside the ashram have guns, revolvers and pistols, and some of them are retired police personnel and ex-servicemen. 

Vashisth added: “We have nothing to hide which is why we granted permission to 86 media persons to cover the operation.” 

The DGP assured that an independent inquiry would be conducted to nail the policemen who attacked mediapersons.
