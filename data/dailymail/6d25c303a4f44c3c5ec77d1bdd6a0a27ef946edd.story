With Wayne Rooney set to make his 100th England appearance against Slovenia on Saturday, he will become only his country's eighth player to be handed that esteemed golden cap.  

With that in mind, Sportsmail takes a little look at the elite group of Three Lions players who have reached (and succeeded) their centenary milestone.

Billy Wright (105 caps)

The late great centre half, who played for Wolverhampton Wanderers for 20 years, was the first footballer to win 100 caps for his country. Wright completed the impressive achievement against Scotland in a 1-0 victory at Wembley on April 11, 1959.

Bobby Charlton (106 caps)

A member of England’s 1966 World Cup winning squad and Ballon d’Or winner in the same year, Manchester United and England legend Charlton won his 100th cap against Northern Ireland on April 21, 1970, marking the appearance with a goal in a 3-1 victory.

Bobby Moore (108 caps)

The captain of the England 1966 World Cup winning team was one of the best defenders to ever grace a football pitch for both England and West Ham, reaching the landmark in a convincing 5-0 friendly win over Scotland at Hampden Park on February 14, 1973.

Peter Shilton (125 caps)

Capped 125 times, Shilton is held in the highest regard as the greatest ever goalkeeper to represent his country, and holds the record for the most caps by any England player. His 100th cap came in a 3-1 defeat by eventual winners Holland at Euro 1988.

Frank Lampard (106 caps)

Considered one of England’s greatest ever midfielders, Lampard won his 100th cap in a 0-0 draw in Ukraine on September 10, 2013. His England career will be remembered for the ‘ghost goal’ against Germany at the 2010 World Cup.

David Beckham (115 caps)

One of the greatest players to ever wear the No 7 shirt for England, Beckham’s crowning moment came in 2001 when his late free-kick against Greece secured qualification for the World Cup. He made his 100th appearance against France in a 1-0 defeat in the Stade de France on March 26, 2008. His 115 caps stand as a record for an England outfielder.

Steven Gerrard (114 caps)

Rooney's predecessor as skipper, Gerrard made 114 appearances before retiring after this year’s World Cup. His 100th cap came against Sweden on November 14, 2012 in a 4-2 defeat remembered for Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s stunning scissor-kick.

Ashley Cole (107 caps)

England's most recent centurion reached 100 caps at Wembley against Brazil in an impressive 2-1 win on February 6, 2013. Widely considered to be England’s best ever left back, Cole competed in three World Cups and at Euro 2004 and 2012. He announced his retirement from international football on Twitter after failing to make the 2014 World Cup squad.
