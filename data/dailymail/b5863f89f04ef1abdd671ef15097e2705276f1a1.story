Legia Warsaw midfielder Ondrej Duda has delivered a withering put-down to Celtic by insisting Irish minnows St Patrick’s Athletic gave his team a tougher test.

Ronny Deila’s side require an extraordinary fightback at Murrayfield this evening after losing 4-1 in last week’s first leg in the Polish capital.

That was in stark contrast to Legia’s previous home game in the Champions League qualifiers, when St Pat’s emerged with a goalless draw before being hammered 5-0 in Dublin.

Slammed: Ondrej Duda says Irish side St Patrick's Athletic gave Legia Warsaw a tougher test than Celtic

Slovakian youngster Duda claims he is not complacent about the return game with Celtic, but admitted he has already selected an ideal opponent for the play-off round.

‘St Patrick’s player a lot tougher against us than Celtic,’ he said. ‘They gave us a very tough game in Warsaw.

‘With Celtic, we didn’t know what to expect, but we were expected to easily beat the Irish side, which we did, but only after a big fright and a good performance away. Fortunately, we regained our composure and we are now on the right track.

‘Of course, we haven’t qualified past Celtic yet, but we have talked about the opponents in the next round.

‘Personally, I would like to get BATE Borisov - I think we would have a really good chance against them.’

The impact of holding the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony means Parkhead remains out of commission. That could be viewed as an advantage for Legia but Duda is cautious about the visit to Edinburgh.

Cocky? The midfielder admits he is already thinking of their next round opponents

‘We respect our opponents,’ he insisted. ‘Celtic are a great club. They will have good support from their fans. But we have a big advantage from the first leg, so I am very confident.

‘We won’t approach the game thinking we have already won it - that kind of attitude would see us lose it. But we have united as a team after last Wednesday and we want to look forward. I did not think it was my best game personally but the whole team rose to the challenge.

‘The Champions League is the most important competition to us now and it would be fantastic to get to the group stage.’

The brutal truth for Celtic is that they could be facing an even greater deficit. Legia’s Ivica Vrdoljak failed to convert two penalties in the first leg.

‘I went to Ivica for the second one and I said that I could take it,’ recalled Duda. ‘I felt strong and I wanted to try.

‘He decided to take it again and, frankly, I do not blame him. He is very strong mentally and sometimes these situations happen. Ivica played a great match and that’s what counts.

‘If we win a penalty in the second match, I think it will be taken again by Ivica.’

Disappointing: Celtic were embarrassed in the first leg, losing 4-1 away from home

Meanwhile, Legia manager Henning Berg has defended the celebrations of his players at the end of the first leg.

Injured Celtic captain Scott Brown has insisted his colleagues will draw motivation from the goading way the Polish side greeted their 4-1 victory.

Berg, though, believes there was no intention by his charges to go over-the-top and create an impression of job done.

‘It was just happiness,’ he insisted. ‘I think our players were just so happy to play a good game and score good goals. I think that’s what they were celebrating.

‘It was a big win for us against a big team and that brought joy. But it wasn’t celebrating because they think the tie is over. We still have another big game to come. We know we have to play well and do our job 100 per cent. We also expect Celtic to do better.

‘Nothing is decided yet. As I said, I think players were just happy with what they did last week.

‘Before this tie started, Celtic were big, big favourites. It is difficult to say who the favourites are now.’

Sloppy: Efe Ambrose was sent off in the match

The former Rangers centre-back also played down the impact of Celtic being displaced from their home.

‘Of course, the atmosphere at Celtic Park is huge,’ added Berg. ‘It is the same at Ibrox.

‘But if the Celtic fans fill this stadium then there will be a huge atmosphere here, as well.

‘It’s still in Scotland in front of their supporters. I’m sure Celtic will treat it as a home game, as they did in the last round against KR Reykjavik.

‘This is a good test for us. We don’t have the Champions League experience that Celtic have. We want to get to their level so this a good chance to test ourselves against a team that has played in Europe for many years.’
