Steven St. Jacques has been charged with stealing $100 in birthday money from an autistic man

A 27-year-old man has been charged with stealing $100 in birthday money from an autistic man in a crime that was captured by video cameras.

Police say they charged Steven St. Jacques of Stamford on Monday with second-degree larceny after a search of his home turned up clothing that matched those worn by the suspect in the video.

Officers say they received important tips after posting the video of last Tuesday's robbery on YouTube at the Connecticut park. 

The surveillance footage of the theft at Veteran's Park shows the suspect entering the park from Old Main Street behind Patrick Kogut, the 27-year-old victim. 

The suspect then followed the victim into a breezeway where he can be seen engaging Kogut in conversation and talking him into pulling the cash out of his pocket.

Kogut excitedly shows the suspect the money, which he had received for his birthday from his family.

He puts it into the suspect's hand and he is seen examining it before apparently taunting Kogut by holding it in front of him but not letting him have it back.

The thief convinces the autistic man to show him the cash he was given from family for his birthday then takes it from him

He then appears to replace the money in the victim's pocket before giving him a hug and walking back in the direction he came from.

Kogut, believing his money has been returned, also turns and walks away.

 However, the thief did not replace the money in the pocket.

The thief pretends to return the cash to the autistic man's pocket but instead puts it in his own

The two men walk off in opposite directions before the victim realized he has been robbed of his birthday money

Members of the police union collected $1,300 and presented it to Kogut and his mother, Irena on Monday. 

'We were able to get Patrick back his money and then some,' said Sgt Kelly Connelly reported Stamford Advocate. 

A smiling Kogut stuck up both thumbs in approval and said: 'Thanks you, guys. Thank you, guys.'

St. Jacques has no listed phone number and could not be reached for comment.
