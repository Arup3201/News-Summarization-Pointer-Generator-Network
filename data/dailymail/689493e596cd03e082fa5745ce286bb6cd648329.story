A new magnetic 'pain zapping' device could transform the lives of migraine sufferers by relieving their pain with the push of a button

A new magnetic ‘pain zapping’ device could transform the lives of migraine sufferers with the push of a button.

Many of England's six million migraine sufferers have been offered new hope after Britain's health and care guidance body recommended for use a portable device which sends pulses to the brain.

In NHS guidance, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) revealed the encouraging results of clinical trials of the gadget.

The controlled trial saw 164 migraine patients treated with single transcranial magnetic stimulation and 39 per cent were pain-free two hours later.

One day after the treatment, 29 per cent were still pain free as were 27 per cent after 48 hours.

In a separate study, three-quarters of patients with migraine who were treated repeatedly with the transcranial magnetic device had a reduction in headache frequency, even those with chronic migraine.

The size and weight of a hair-dryer, the device is held against the back of the head at the first sign of a migraine.

At the push of a button it gives out two fleeting bursts of electricity which short-circuit the 'electrical storm' in the brain that causes the splitting pain, flashing lights and blurred vision associated with migraines.

Miriam Heyburn, now in her 60s, has suffered from migraine since the age of eight and had headaches every other day, or daily, in recent years.

The TMS device has enabled her to go four, five, and occasionally even 10 days, without headaches.

Ms Heyburn, of Croydon, south London, said: ‘The device has transformed my life and I don't have to take anywhere near as many tablets.’

Estimates suggest that in Britain there are 190,000 migraine attacks every day and 25 million days are lost from work or school each year as a result.

The device may prove appropriate for those who find alternatives ineffective, or unsuitable, such as for people who are pregnant.

People interested in trying the device can ask their GP for a referral to a specialist migraine and headache clinic.

Wendy Thomas, chief executive of the charity The Migraine Trust, said: ‘Huge numbers of sufferers find their lives blighted by migraine.

‘We welcome NICE guidance that may help deliver brighter futures to many people for whom other treatments have not worked.’

Professor Peter Goadsby, chair of the British Association for the Study of Headache, and director of the National Headache Centre at King's College Hospital in London, said: ‘Single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a wonderful example of clinical and laboratory research delivering a real improvement in migraine treatment that is both effective and extremely well tolerated.

‘Many patients are going to get real benefit from this device.’

Consultant neurologist Dr Fayyaz Ahmed, a trustee of The Migraine Trust, added: ‘This is a breakthrough treatment for those who cannot tolerate or do not respond to current treatment, and opens the door for a new era in treating migraine headaches.

‘We welcome NICE guidance and very much hope this treatment is made available to those in need.’
