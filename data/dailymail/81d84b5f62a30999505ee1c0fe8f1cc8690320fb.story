A medieval man, who may have been a knight, died from injuries sustained from jousting, marks on his skeleton suggest.

The remains were found at Hereford Cathedral and show signs of injury to the right shoulder as well as fractured ribs.

Experts said the wounds are all consistent with injuries that are sustained through tourney or jousting.

Jousting involved two or more knights on horseback fighting with lances and was used in medieval times to practice battle skills and settle disputes.

Archaeologists were excavating the remains at the Heritage Lottery-funded project between 2009 and 2011 – but investigations are still ongoing into some of the more unusual skeletons, including that of the knight.

They have all been uncovered at the Cathedral, which was built in the early 12th Century and forms a Norman centre piece to the Historic City of Hereford on the banks of the River Wye.

The knight was laid to rest in a partial stone lined burial, which was popular in the area between 1100 and 1300 – the late medieval period.

The skeleton has many fractures to the ribs and right shoulder, some of which have healed and others have not, indicating they were caused on numerous occasions.

They suggest that the man did not recover from the wounds when he died, aged approximately 45.

There is even a chance that his injuries may have caused his demise.

This is another injury that is consistent with jousting, according to experts at Headland Archaeology, based in Edinburgh.

Jousting began with the emergence of the knights as warriors in the 10th century.

Tournaments were organised as a way for them to practice their horsemanship and lance skills.

A Frenchman called Godfrey de Preuilly is said to have arranged the first tournament in 1066,LordsandLadies.org reported. 

After the Normans conquered the English at the Battle of Hastings, they divided up land among themselves and set up the medieval feudal system, in which everyone owed allegiance to the King and also the nobles.

Andy Boucher, said: '...there is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting this man was involved in some form of violent activity and the locations of his injuries do match quite closely what might be expected from taking part in mock battles.'

Nobles provided trained knights to fight for the king and tournaments were devised so they could practice their skills in vicious mock battles.

These took the form of a line of knights facing each other on horseback in full armour, who began the 'lance charge'.

The dangerous gatherings were banned by Henry II to prevent injuries to valuable fighters.

But his son, Richard I, relaxed the rules and granted licenses to hold jousting tournaments.

The original tournaments saw large numbers of knights fighting as individuals or teams, on horse and foot.

The fights were treated as real battles – some resulted in death and some losers were ransomed. 

But in 1292, a new rule decreed that weapons should be blunted and the 'lance of peace' with a decorative tip was rolled out.

Sometimes disputes were settled by jousting and the victor was seen to have God on his side and was therefore not guilty.

In Tudor times, jousting was merged with magnificent pageants and state occasions, such as for the marriage of King Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and they were still popular during Elizabeth I's reign.

The sport declined with the invention of the musket in 1520 and became a form of entertainment only.

The knight was laid to rest in a partial stone lined burial, which was popular in the area between 1100 and 1300 – the early medieval period. Experts believe that the man had not recovered from his latest wounds when he died, at approximately 45 years old

Andy Boucher who managed the post excavation work, said: 'Obviously we can never be sure how people came about their wounds, but in this case there is a considerable amount of evidence suggesting this man was involved in some form of violent activity and the locations of his injuries do match quite closely what might be expected from taking part in mock battles.

‘The fact that he was still doing this after he was 45 suggests he must have been very tough'.

Analysis of the knight’s teeth suggest he had been brought up in Normandy and moved to Hereford in later life.

Some 700 individuals were unearthed at the site, offering glimpses of life, disease, accident and injury from the Norman Conquest until Victorian times.

Among the remains are one of a leper and a mysterious lady with a severed hand, leading some archaeologists to hypothesise she may have been a thief.
