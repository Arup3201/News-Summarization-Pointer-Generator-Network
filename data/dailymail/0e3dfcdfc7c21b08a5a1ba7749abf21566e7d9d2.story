Father's Anger: Johnny Berry - the father of Amanda Berry - has spoken of his rage at her accused kidnapper Ariel Castro and his desire to kill him

The father of Amanda Berry has revealed how his daughter is struggling to recover after ten years in captivity in Cleveland and is petrified that her accused kidnapper Ariel Castro is coming back for her.

Johnny Berry, 52, who is dying from a deadly pulmonary disease, told the National Enquirer that 'Amanda's having a terrible time. She's having nightmares every night, waking up screaming and crying, terrified that Castro is coming after her, or that she's still a prisoner.

'She's told me she's afraid her freedom is a dream and she's going to wake up to the horror of finding out she is still a prisoner.'

But as Amanda Berry recovers from her decade-long prison ordeal, her father has spoken of his anger to declare that he would like to kill her accused kidnapper Ariel Castro.

'If I could get my hands on that monster Castro, I'd kill him myself!' said Berry from his death bed in Elizabethton, Tennessee.

Near paralyzed from recent back surgery, Berry, who is covered in tattoos and wears an uncomfortable neck brace, explained that if he can't kill Castro, then he wants him to rot in jail for the rest of his life.

'If I can't kill him, I don't want the state to execute him,' said Berry to the National Enquirer. 'That would be too easy for him.'

'I want him in prison for the rest of his life. I know people in there who can make his life a living hell for what he did to Amanda. I want them to beat the s**t out of him every single day.'

Amanda Berry was dramatically rescued from Ariel Castro's Cleveland, Ohio, home along with Gina DeJesus, Michelle Knight and her own six year old child by Castro, Jocelyn on May 6th.

The three women had been kept prisoner by Castro for almost ten years and suffered systematic rapes, beatings and induced abortions at the hands of the 52-year-old former school bus driver.

It has been claimed that the three dogs who lived in the home with the girls were kept in better condition that they were - and the girls still have to decide whether they want to take them back.

The last time that Johnny Berry saw his daughter, she was working as a 16-year-old in the local Burger King, enjoying her time at school where she was doing well.

Now, Johnny, who has served time himself in jail for sexual battery and aggravated assault, has expressed his fears that he may never see his daughter again or the grand-daughter he has never met.

However, he told the National Enquirer that he has at least spoken to Amanda twice since her lucky escape earlier this month.

'When she called me, her voice was the most beautiful sound I ever heard,' said Johnny.

'She said, 'Hi daddy. I'm still alive. I love you, love you, love you!' We were both crying...it was the happiest day of my life.'

Amanda, who is now 27 is living currently with her sister Beth Serrano in Cleveland and is said to be suffering from the horrifying memories of her ordeal at the hands of Castro.

Johnny was married to Amanda's mother, Louwana Miller up until one month before Amanda's disappearance. She died in 2005.

'I can't say I was the best dad in the world,' admitted Johnny. 'I feel a lot of guilt that I wasn't there for Amanda when she needed me.

'If I had known where she was, I would have gotten a gun and gone over there and gotten her out myself, but we had no idea. It was like she just disappeared off the face of the earth.'

Despite his confirmation that his daughter is struggling, the three women rescued after being held captive in a Cleveland house for about a decade want the community to know they are doing fine and appreciate offers of help.

The message was relayed in a letter released Tuesday by their attorneys.

The letter said Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight are happy and safe. A charity fund to help the women has raised more than $650,000 from more than 6,800 donors.

Berry broke through a locked door on May 6, yelled to neighbors for help and enabled Knight and DeJesus to escape.

'These three brave women have asked us to give this message to everyone who has expressed concern and support,' said the attorneys, who are representing the women for free.

'Amanda, Gina and Michelle want you to know they are doing well. They are happy and safe and continue to heal, a process that requires time and privacy.

'To have complete strangers offer loving support in the form of money, goods and services, reaching out to help like a family member, is appreciated in ways that are impossible to put into words.'

Ariel Castro, a 52-year-old former school bus driver, has been charged with three counts of rape and four counts of kidnapping, one for each of the three women and one for Berry's 6-year-old daughter fathered by Castro.

His defense team says he will plead not guilty. The case is pending before a Cuyahoga County grand jury.
