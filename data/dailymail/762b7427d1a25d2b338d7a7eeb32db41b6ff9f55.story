Ali Carter has made a winning return to competitive snooker by beating Marco Fu 4-1 at the General Cup in Hong Kong.

The 35-year-old, twice World Championship runner-up and former world No 2, had not played in an event since being diagnosed with lung cancer in May.

Carter, who had already overcome testicular cancer, made three breaks of 55 in his comfortable win over the home favourite.

He tweeted afterwards: 'All things considered, a great start for me beating a top player like Marco. Onwards and upwards.'

Carter was due to compete at a Players Tour Tournament in Sofia last week but pains in his left arm following treatment forced him to withdraw.

Chelmsford-based Carter had not played competitively since the World Championship after being diagnosed with a form of lung cancer that required extensive chemotherapy treatment. 

Although the General Cup does not count towards the rankings, Carter could still feature in the UK Championship in York next month.
