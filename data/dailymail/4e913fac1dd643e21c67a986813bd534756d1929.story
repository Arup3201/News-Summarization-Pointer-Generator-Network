Dead: Steve Parsons, 48, took a fatal cyanide pill just moments after he was sentenced to spend up to seven years in jail for having sex with a 14-year-old girl

A man who was convicted of having sex with a teenager has taken a fatal overdose of cyanide while in the courtroom just moments after he was sentenced to seven years behind bars. 

Court staff and his family looked on in horror as Steve Parsons suddenly keeled over and had a deadly seizure.

The 48 year old had moments earlier been found guilty of statutory sodomy of a 14-year-old girl.

He was about to be jailed for seven until he decided to impose his own death sentence in front of his own family in the Maryville, Missouri courtroom on Thursday.

Witnesses said Parsons pretended he was going to be sick, telling court staff: ‘I'm going to throw up.'

He walked to a court clerk's table to get a sip of water.

At the time the judge was polling the jury after they had reached a guilty verdict after a three day trial in Maryville, Missouri.

Parsons took a sip of water and returned to his seat.

No one in the court saw him slip a cyanide pill into his mouth, but the well-known business owner suddenly began arching his back and had a seizure.

Court staff tried to help Parsons but he went into cardiac arrest on the way to hospital.

Well-known: Parsons owned a tire store in the area and would have had to have registered as a sex offender

He was pronounced dead at the  Heartland Regional Medical Center in St. Joseph.

A later search of Parsons car revealed a scrap of paper with the name of a chemical company and a phone number.

Fox 4 News reports the company confirmed to police that Parsons had placed an order of 100mg of cyanide and had it shipped overnight to his home.

Fatal pill: He ordered a 100mg cyanide pill just days before the sentencing

A medical examiner confirmed Parson's death was from cyanide poisoning.

Parsons was facing up to seven years in jail after being convicted of statutory sodomy of a teen girl. He would also be on the sex offenders register for life.

He was well known in the towns of Maryville and Stanberry as the owner of Parson's Tyre and Service.

Gentry County Sheriff Darrin White was in court when Parsons collapsed.

He said: ‘It’s not common to see someone just fall over dead in the courtroom even though they’ve just been found guilty of a crime.

'I was quite surprised and disappointed and unhappy and sorry. Sorry for the victim, sorry for her family.'

Biggs says he has mixed feelings about Parson’s death.

‘I suspect that it’s just more tragedy on top of tragedy,’ Biggs said.
