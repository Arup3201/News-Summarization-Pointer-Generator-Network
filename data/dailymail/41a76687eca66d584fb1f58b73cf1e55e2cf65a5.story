The Archbishop of Canterbury issued an extraordinary apology for the British bombing of Dresden during the Second World War

The Archbishop of Canterbury last night issued an extraordinary apology for the British bombing of Dresden during the Second World War.

In what was immediately criticised as an insult to the young men who gave their lives to defeat the Nazis, the Most Rev Justin Welby told the German people of his ‘profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow’ over the attack.

His comments at a ceremony in Dresden to mark the 70th anniversary of the bombings came amid a growing row about BBC coverage of the commemoration in which Britain was described as ‘worse than the Nazis’ over the raids that killed thousands at the end of the war.

Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth criticised the Archbishop, saying: ‘I do not hear Angela Merkel apologising for the Blitz.’ And historian Professor Anthony Glees said it was wrong to take a single incident in the war and say sorry for it. Archbishop Welby said the bombing of Dresden, which killed an estimated 25,000, ‘diminished all our humanity’.

But he made no reference to the 55,573 British aircrew killed in the struggle to overthrow Hitler, nor to the German bombing of London and Coventry.

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘These remarks do sound to me like an apology. For the Archbishop to make an apology for our defeat of Hitler is bizarre. I would have thought the last thing we should be doing is apologising. We should be praised for defeating Hitler. These words are an insult to the young men who gave their lives in the defeat of Germany.’

The Archbishop – whose great uncle Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal was one of the main architects of Britain’s campaign of bombing German cities – told the congregation he thought it was ‘miraculous’ that they were welcoming him given the ‘brutal and devastating’ nature of the attack.

‘Over three days in February allied bombers brought death and destruction on a scale and with a ferocity it is impossible to imagine,’ he said. 

‘Much debate surrounds this most controversial raid of the allied bombing campaign. Whatever the arguments, events here 70 years ago left a deep wound and diminished all our humanity. So as a follower of Jesus I stand here among you with a profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow.’

He praised the reconciliation of Europe and the growth of friendship after the war. 

The references to profound regret and deep sorrow sparked furore among veterans and Conservative politicians already angered by BBC news reports on the anniversary dominated by graphic accounts of the deaths of German victims.

An interview with a British prisoner of war – who called the bombing of Dresden a ‘war crime’ – was repeated several times.

Sir Gerald, a Tory MP, said: ‘Our wartime military commanders, Winston Churchill, and the men of Bomber Command should not be held to blame for the deaths of civilians such as those in Dresden.

‘That was the fault of the German people who failed to remove Hitler and his evil regime. It is very unfortunate that the Archbishop felt unable to pay tribute to the heroism of the young men of Bomber Command, half of whom gave their lives so that the German people could ultimately be liberated from Hitler’s tyranny.’

Professor Glees, of Buckingham University, said: ‘Britain did not want to fight that war.

‘But once it began we were determined to win it, knowing that civilian lives would be taken. Most people are satisfied that the RAF bombing campaign was not motivated by vindictiveness but was part of a strategy to bring the war to a close as quickly as possible.

‘Winston Churchill thought the bombing of Dresden had gone too far. But he would never have apologised for it, never.’

Of the BBC coverage, military top brass, RAF veterans, politicians and historians said it ignored the atrocities committed by Hitler and the military justifications for the attack. Sir Gerald said that the one-sided reporting of the raid was disgraceful.

He said: ‘It is very unfortunate that the BBC chose on all days to produce such a one-sided account.

‘It was just as one might expect from the BBC, concentrating on the negatives. What about the civilians in London who were bombed out of their homes? What about the bombing in the Blitz?

‘To suggest that those responsible for the bombing of Dresden were on a par with Hitler or guilty of war crimes is an absolute disgrace.’

A church of England spokesman pointed to interviews following the Archbishop’s speech in which he had ‘refused to say he was apologising’.

The spokesman said: ‘Any suggestion that the Archbishop was apologising is manifestly false. The Archbishop’s comments were a reflection in a solemn ceremony on the tragedy of war.

‘They very carefully avoided apologising, and those present, including the President of Germany, recognised the difference. In his speech, he also recognised the fact that there is no equivalence with Nazi war crimes and that the war started with Nazi aggression.

‘In broadcast interviews immediately following his speech the Archbishop refused to say he was apologising, but repeated that war is always tragedy. He also referred to the terrible losses in Bomber command. Mr Welby said it was not a question of blame and spoke of the bombing of Coventry, Liverpool, London and other places.’
