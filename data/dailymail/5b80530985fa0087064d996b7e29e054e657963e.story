For 21 years, fans wanting to pay their respects at Freddie Mercury’s last resting place have had nowhere to go.

The singer was cremated after he died of Aids in 1991 but the whereabouts of his ashes remained unknown.

Now fans believe a plaque spotted at a West London cemetery over the weekend could solve the mystery.

Mystery: Freddie (left) was cremated after his death in 1991 but it is not known where they were scattered. Fans hope the tribute plaque discovered at London's Kensal Green Cemetery (right) could hold the answer

Final resting place? Dates on the memorial plaque thought to relate to the Queen singer (pictured centre) match his birth and death

Plaque: Farrokh Bulsara was Freddie's real name, and the French message translates as 'always to be close to you with all my love'. 'M' could relate to his former girlfriend Mary Austin who lived in London

The plaque is in place at Kensal Rise 
cemetery and dedicated to Farrokh Bulsara,  Mercury’s birth name. He 
became Freddie Mercury after forming Queen in 1971.

The French tribute to the great lead singer in Kensal Green Cemetery may be the clue fans have been searching for, because the dates engraved on it match those of his life and staff did not know it was there.

The small plaque sits on a tall plinth among tributes to other individuals and reads: 'In Loving Memory of Farrokh Bulsara. Pour Etre Toujours Pres De Toi Avec Tout Mon Amour'.

This translates as 'Always To Be Close To You With All My Love' and is signed off with a letter 'M'.

The M could stand for his former 
girlfriend Mary Austin, who received his £7million home Garden Lodge, an
 eight-bedroom property in Kensington, London.

A statement on the  Kensal Green Cemetery's website says plaques like these 'can be provided for those whose cremated remains have been strewn in the Scattering Garden'.

Clue: The plaque is a significant find in the west London cemetery (pictured) that contains other famous people including William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope

Success: Freddie Mercury's band, which included celebrated guitarist Brian May, sold 300million records and the lead singer was a worldwide icon

The only one: Freddie's former girlfriend and life-long friend Mary (pictured in 1984) was the one who took possession of his ashes after the cremation

A spokesman for Mercury's estate refused to comment but fans believe this could be a discovery they have waited decades for.

'Everyone knows Freddie was cremated at Kensal Green Cemetery in 1991 but it has remained a
complete mystery as to where his ashes were finally laid to rest', one told the Daily Mirror.

'According to some biographies, his ashes weren’t even collected from Kensal Green for well over a year following his cremation.

'The discovery of this plaque is really exciting and may prove to be a major breakthrough.'

Partner: Freddie Mercury and his love Jim Hutton, who believed that the singer's ashes had been scattered by a tree in his Kensington garden

At the heart of this latest twist appears to be Mary Austin, who the bisexual vocalist called his 'wife', and who inherited a great deal of his wealth.

She also received his song rights, which continue to make huge sums, because Queen sold 300 million albums round the world and had a number of huge-selling number one singles like Bohemian Rhapsody.

The singer's former partner, Jim Hutton, said in a 1994 interview he believed that Freddie's ashes were buried at Garden Lodge, adding: 'It’s become something of a riddle but I’m pretty sure his final resting place is at the foot of the weeping cherry tree overlooking the whole place.'

But there have long been strong rumours that his remains may actually have been scattered on Zanzibar, the paradise island he was born on off Tanzania or on the shore of Lake Geneva, in Montreux, where he had a home.
