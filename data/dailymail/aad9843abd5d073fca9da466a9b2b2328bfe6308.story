Palermo's coveted forward Paulo Dybala has admitted he dreams of playing for either Manchester City or Barcelona.

Manchester United, Juventus, Chelsea and Roma are among clubs to have checked on the £30m-rated 21-year-old who has 11 goals and six assists in Serie A this season.

However, talking to Italian sport magazine Guerin Sportivo, he said: 'When I play with the Playstation, I always choose Barcelona or Manchester City.

'I dream to play one day with one of those clubs.'

Palermo president Maurizio Zamparini has admitted his relationship with Dybala has deteriorated recently, hinting that the player's head has been turned, and the Argentine has now spoken about leaving the club.

Zamparini warned suitors in November that Dybala would cost in the region of £30m but Dybala said: 'I honestly think it's an exaggeration. 

'I still have a lot to prove, I try not to think too much about these labels and concentrate solely on my performance on the pitch.'

Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool have also been to watch Dybala this season
