Japanese factories have been forced to temporarily close in China and expatriate workers advised to stay indoors after angry protests over ownership of islands in the East China Sea spilled on to the streets.

Over the weekend in China there have been violent attacks on well-known Japanese businesses such as car-makers Toyota and Honda in the country's worst outbreak of anti-Japan sentiment in decades.

The dispute over the islands, known as the Senkaku by Japan and the Diaoyu by China, now threatens to seriously damage trade ties between Asia's two biggest economies with Chinese state media warning that trade relations are in jeopardy.

Protesters march during an anti-Japan protest in Shenzhen in south China's Guangdong province yesterday - they are angry about Japan's 'nationalizing' of the disputed Diaoyu Islands

The long-standing dispute erupted last week when the Japanese government decided to buy some of the islands from a private Japanese owner

'I'm not going out today and I've asked 
my Chinese boyfriend to be with me all day tomorrow,' said Sayo 
Morimoto, a 29-year-old Japanese graduate student at a university in 
Shenzhen.

Japanese housewife and mother Kayo Kubo, who lives in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, said her young family and other Japanese expats were also staying home after being terrified by the scale and mood of the weekend protests in dozens of cities.

'There were so many people and I've never seen anything like it. It was very scary,' she said.

China and Japan, which generated two-way trade of $345 billion last year, are arguing over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, a long-standing dispute that erupted last week when the Japanese government decided to buy some of them from a private Japanese owner.

The move, which infuriated Beijing, 
was intended by Japan's government to fend off what it feared would be 
seen as an even more provocative plan by the nationalist governor of 
Tokyo to buy and build facilities on the islands.

In response, China sent six 
surveillance ships to the area, which contains potentially large gas 
reserves.

Today a flotilla of around 1,000 Chinese fishing boats 
were sailing for the islands and are due to reach them later in the day,
the state-owned People's Daily said on its microblog.

The weekend's protests mainly 
targeted Japanese diplomatic missions but also shops, restaurants and 
car dealerships in at least five cities. Toyota and Honda said arsonists
had badly damaged their stores in the eastern port city of Qingdao at 
the weekend.

Toyota said its factories and
offices were operating as normal again today and workers were back in work, however, Japanese electronics group Panasonic 
said one of its plants had been sabotaged by Chinese workers and would 
remain closed through tomorrow - the anniversary of Japan's 1931 
occupation of parts of mainland China.

Tokyo fears the date could 
cause another dangerous outbreak of anti-Japan sentiment.

Many Japanese schools across 
China, including in Beijing and Shanghai, have cancelled classes this 
week.

Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko 
Noda, who met visiting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta today, 
urged Beijing to ensure Japan's people and property were protected.

Panetta said the U.S. would 
stand by its security treaty obligations to Japan but not take sides in 
the row, and urged calm and restraint on both sides in their dispute 
over the islands.

'It is in everybody's interest ... 
for Japan and China to maintain good relations and to find a way to 
avoid further escalation,' he told reporters In Tokyo.

The overseas edition of the People's 
Daily, the main newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, warned that 
Beijing could resort to economic retaliation if the dispute festers.

'How could it be that Japan wants 
another lost decade, and could even be prepared to go back by two 
decades,' said a front-page editorial in the newspaper. China 'has 
always been extremely cautious about playing the economic card', it 
said.

'But in struggles concerning 
territorial sovereignty, if Japan continues its provocations, then China
will take up the battle,' the paper said.

Japanese Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba said after talks with Panetta, that Tokyo and Washington agreed the disputed islets were covered by the Japan-U.S. security treaty.

'I did not bring up the topic today, but it is mutually understood between Japan and the United States that (the islands) are covered by the treaty,' he said after meeting U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in Tokyo.

Japanese electronics firm Canon Inc has stopped production at three of its four Chinese factories for today and tomorrow, citing concerns over employees' safety, Japanese media reports said, while All Nippon Airways Co reported a rise in cancellations on Japan-bound flights from China.

The dispute also hit the shares of Hong Kong-listed Japanese retailers today, with department store operator Aeon Stores (Hong Kong) Co Ltd falling to a seven-month low.

'All Japan-related shares are under selling pressure ...,' said Andrew To, a research director from Emperor Capital.

The oil-rich islands in the East China sea are the cause of the violent dispute between China and Japan

China is Japan's biggest trade partner and Japan is China's third largest. Any harm to business and investment ties would be bad for both economies at a time when China faces a slowdown.

Qingdao police announced on the Internet today they had arrested a number of people suspected of 'disrupting social order' during the protests, apparently referring to the attacks on Japanese-operated factories and shops there.

In Shanghai, home to China's biggest Japanese expatriate population of 56,000, one expat said his family as well as other Japanese customers had been chased out of a Japanese restaurant on Sunday by protesters near the Japanese consulate.

Guangzhou police said on an official microblog, that they had detained 11 people for smashing up a Japanese-brand car, shop windows and billboards on Sunday.
