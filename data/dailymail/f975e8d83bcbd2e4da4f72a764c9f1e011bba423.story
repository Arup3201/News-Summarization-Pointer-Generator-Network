If you're a ghosthunter this could be right up your street.

Fans of the paranormal take to all corners of the country in their search for something not of this world, and our map can help you plan a real ghost tour - right in time for Halloween.

Esri UK has conducted research and taken on testimonies about creepy going on at a number of sites throughout the UK and then devised a map of where you can, if you really want to, visit the ghosts.

If you live in or around London, a trip to the Tower of London is a must, with Queen Anne Boleyn, Lady Arbella Stuart and Thomas A Becket just some of the spooks which have reportedly been seen here.

The Jamaica Inn in Cornwall is 'haunted' by admission of the owners themselves, and has featured on TV's Most Haunted, where the team described it as 'one of the most spookiest places that they had ever visited. There have been reports of spooky goings-on including the sounds of horses' hooves, whispering foreign voices and footsteps.

The inn is also the setting for Daphne du Maurier's 1936 novel of the same name, as well as the 1939 Alfred Hitchcock film, the 1983 television series and the 2014 TV adaptation.

The ghost society reported strange events in the Smuggler's Bar, the Stable Bar, the restaurant and in bedroom four on the upper floor.

The Tower of London is said to be haunted by Ann Boleyn, who was sentenced to death by Henry VIII

Jamaica Inn, the setting for a novel, film and TV programme, has reported many eerie goings-on

And Pluckley in Kent is officially the most haunted village in the world according to the Guinness Book of Records - so should be a 'must-see' for paranormal thrill-seekers throughout the UK.

And for those who fear nothing, take a visit to Greyfriars Kirkyard, in Edinburgh, Scotland, dubbed as one of the most terrifying places on earth with a hive of paranormal activity to its name.

The most famous apparition is the poltergeist of Mackenzie. Visitors have reported being bruised, scratched and having gouge-marks on their bodies after visiting this site.

Twelve different ghosts have been reported, with a highway man, a screaming man and the Red Lady invoking the most fear in the locals.

The map was created by mapping and analytics company Esri UK and contains 100 sites.
