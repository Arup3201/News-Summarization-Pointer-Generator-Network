The Atlanta Braves fan who died last month after falling over 80 feet during a game at the team’s stadium climbed an out of the way railing and jumped, according to a just-released autopsy.

Ronald Lee Homer Jr’s death was ruled a suicide last month, but the chilling details weren’t made public until now. It has also been revealed the 30-year-old discussed another fatal fall at the ballpark with friends.

The Fulton County Medical Examiner’s report details how Mr Homer climbed over the Turner Field railing, one leg at a time, and then jumped feet-first, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He landed on the players parking lot.

Suicidal: At least one friend told investigators he thought Ronald Lee Homer Jr was suicidal

‘The departure railing was not in an area typically accessed by visitors to the ball park, and the decedent made a conscious decision to go there without his friends,’ Dr Michele Stauffenberg wrote.

‘Therefore, it is unlikely the decedent was deceived as to the danger of this act,’ she continued.

The lifelong Braves fan also discussed with friends a 2008 death at the park resulting from a fan’s fall from the upper deck, said the report.

At least one friend admitted to investigators that he believed the tormented man was suicidal, the report said.

Though Mr Homer’s blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit, drinking is not believed to have contributed to the fatal fall, according to the report.

‘Alcohol intoxication may have played a role in his behavior and decision-making process, but not in making him unsteady near a dangerous railing,’ said the report.

The distraught man died from blunt force trauma to his torso and lower extremities at a local hospital.Initially blamed on wet conditions after a two hour rain delay and intoxication, Mr Homer’s death was soon ruled a suicide.

His mother described him as a lifelong Braves fan and said he called to tell her he loved her before leaping to his death.

‘He said ‘I love you mom, and I said ‘I love you too’ and that was it.’
