One of the biggest concerns for owners of electric cars is that their battery could run out at any moment, leaving them stranded with no recharging station nearby. 

So-called 'range anxiety' is a fear that has apparently plagued some owners of Tesla’s Model S vehicle, but now CEO Elon Musk has revealed he has a solution.

In a tweet he said he would reveal a way to tackle the issue at a conference on Thursday, and while no further details are known, it seems the smart money may be on either navigation software that shows the best route to a charging station or an update that boosts the car's battery power.

California-based Tesla is to announce a software update on Friday. Elon Musk revealed it would be for the 'entire Model S fleet' in a tweet. This suggests it may be a trick to boost the battery power of the car (Model S pictured in a promotional shot). Others have suggested it could be new turn by turn navigation software

In the Tweet Musk said: ‘Tesla press conf at 9am [Pacific Time, 4pm GMT] on Thurs.

‘About to end range anxiety … via OTA software update.

‘Affects entire Model S fleet.’

Running low on fuel and making a desperate search for the nearest station could soon be a thing of the past.

Earlier this month Ford unveiled its latest app that not only shows how far you can travel on the power you have remaining, it bases its predictions on your unique driving style.

The MyFord Mobile also lets drivers remotely access their vehicles meaning they can set the cabin temperature on a cold morning before they leave their house.

The app was announced at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and currently works with a selection of Ford’s electric and hybrid cars. 

That Musk says this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory, namely more of Tesla’s ‘supercharger’ stations being added.

However, the fact that it affects the entire Model S fleet may also pour cold water on the ‘turn by turn navigation’ theory.

This is because not every car has the ability to have such a feature, so unless Musk is planning to upgrade those that are not with new hardware, this may seem unlikely.

Several outlets have been reporting that the answer may lie in some trickery with the car’s software that can boost the battery power. 

In a survey for Consumer Reports in 2012, 77 per cent of respondents said limited range was their biggest concern with electric cars.

The official range of the Model S at the moment is up to 310 miles (500km), which is apparently not enough to quell range anxiety for some drivers.

That Musk says in his tweet (shown) this is a software update seemingly rules out one theory, namely more of Tesla’s ‘supercharger’ stations being added. However, the fact that it affects the entire Model S fleet may also pour cold water on the ‘turn by turn navigation’ theory - as not all the cars have this ability

Only certain models of Tesla's Model S car have the ability to charge their car quickly at the company's supercharger stations, which Tesla lets owners of the Model S use for free. However, the stations are quite few and far between, especially in the UK, at the moment

CNN noted that, last year, Tesla upgraded its Tesla Roadster electric car, increasing its range from 245 to 400 miles (395 to 645km) on a single charge.

This was via a lithium battery pack upgrade and, at the time, Musk tellingly tweeted: ‘Should mention that a battery pack upgrade is not coming soon for the Model S, but it obviously *will* happen long-term.’

Musk has since deleted that tweet, though - perhaps in anticipation of this latest announcement.

‘Musk said that all Model S cars will get the update - if so, that points to battery optimisations, a power-saving mode or smarter navigation,' added Engadget.

Software updates to the Model S aren’t unprecedented, either; in January, an update increased the speed of the top-of-the-line P85D via use of ‘insane mode’ - enabling the car to go 0 to 60mph (97km/h) in 3.2 seconds, compared to the usual 5.9 seconds.

But aside from speculation, there isn’t much that can be done except wait to see what exactly Musk will reveal on Friday.
