The University of North Carolina has apologized for a slew of fake classes that allowed student-athletes to easily get passing grades and keep their focus on the lucrative business of college sports.

From the 1990s, well-known 'easy' courses were on offer at the Chapel Hill school's African and Afro-American Studies Department. The classes were attended in high numbers by football players, basketball stars and wrestlers among others, allowing them to coast through academic life and focus on athletics.

An investigation in 2012 found that some courses allowed students to get a passing grade just for submitting term papers without attending classes or sitting exams.

UNC officials have admitted that there was a lack of academic rigor in some courses offered through their African-American studies department, disproportionately attended by college athletes

Some 216 classes at UNC were found to have problems over a 15-year period - and up to 500 students had their grades changed without authorization. 

Blame was placed with the former Afro-American Studies Department chairman 
Julius Nyang'oro and former administrator Deborah Crowder. Nyangâ€™oro was criminally indicted in December 2013 for defrauding UNC.

It is unclear whether the Athletic Department at Chapel Hill pushed for the fraudulent courses or allowed talented athletes to exploit them.

The school was slow to admit that anything untoward had taken place and 
earlier this month halted a research project into the literacy levels of
 UNC athletes - which found that several were reading 
at below third-grade level.

Academic officials are now taking responsibility for a lack of rigor in some students' educations.

James Dean, the executive vice chancellor at UNC, told Bloomberg: 'We made mistakes. Horrible things happened that Iâ€™m ashamed of. 

James Dean, the executive vice chancellor at UNC, said that the university's integrity was damaged by fraudulent classes while Chancellor Carol L. Folt (right) admitted that students deserved better from UNC

'Student-athletes and other students, too, were hurt. The integrity of our university was badly damaged.'

Chancellor
 Carol L. Folt also addressed the matter in a statement on the 
university's website. She said that reforms were underway to fix 
past problems but added: 'Offering courses that were unsupervised was 
not reflective of the standards that we expect for our University. All 
of those students who were involved in those courses deserved better 
from us.'

The pressures on 
student-athletes to perform outside of the classroom is high as the 
National Collegiate Athletic Association is a multi billion dollar 
business with millions of fans across the U.S.

College athletes often go on to become the next stars of the NFL, NBA and at the Olympics.

The problem is not specific to UNC - schools across the country place great importance on lucrative championship wins, so easing off academically on students who are highly talented on the court or field is a common problem.

UNC is taking changes to the academic program seriously. The disgraced department of the past has been renamed the African, African-American, and Diaspora Studies department.

Mr Dean told Bloomberg he would be examining other departments to see if athletes were 'clustering' in classes that had become known for easy grades. 

Other reforms are now in place including tighter supervision over the academic program of school athletes and an internal investigation has been launched into the scandal to find out how the problem took root.
