A bond between two longtime family friends has deepened after both Michigan men received organs from the same donor.

Fred Nelis, 60, of Holland, got a new heart, while 67-year-old Gordon Veldman of Pentwater, got a new pair of lungs. 

The operations were held at the exact same time at a Grand Rapids hospital last June.

Nelis and Veldman have been close friends for over a decade, however their transplants were completely coincidental.

Incredible bond: Gordon Veldman and Fred Nelis have been friends for over a decade, but now consider themselves 'organ brothers' after each received a transplant from the same donor last June, saving their lives

Lifesaving operation: Fred Nelis, 60, underwent a heart transplant after living with idiopathic cardiomyopathy for the last 20 years

On-the-mend: Gordon Veldman, 67, received a lung transplant to escape a genetic disease that reduced his lung capacity to 15 percent last year

The medical director of the heart and lung transplant program at Spectrum Health says it was the program's first simultaneous friend-transplant that he's aware of. 

'It's pretty wild,' Dr. Michael Dickinson told The Grand Rapids Press.

'We thought it was quite a remarkable story when it happened.

'It's nice for us because it kind of shows the growth of the program - that we were able to help both of these two friends right here in West Michigan.'

Both men suffered from chronic conditions that caused their health to rapidly deteriorate before their transplants. 

Nelis has been suffering for 20 years with idiopathic cardiomyopathy - a progressive heart disease with an unknown cause.

Then in 2013 he developed atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat, and was placed on the heart transplant in March 2014.

Veldman has a genetic disease called Alpha-1, which would potentially destroy his lungs, and caused him to develop emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

One year ago his lung capacity fell to 15 percent, making everyday talks like walking incredibly difficult.  

'The end was very near,' he said. 

'I probably had two months left.'

Then on June 18, 2014, both men received a call - the wait was over.

They were both admitted to Spectrum Health and underwent transplants, with Nelis getting a new heart and Veldman new lungs.

Both have rebounded since the operations.

The men known little about their 32-year-old donor, however were able to send a letter to the man's family through Gift of Life Michigan. 

Veldman said that he and Nelis put their new heart and lungs as close as they can every time they meet.

'We got a gift, and it's best that we treat it as such,' Nelis said.
