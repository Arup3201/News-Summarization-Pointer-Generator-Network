Fugly the chihuahua is bald, missing most of his hair and can't stop his tongue hanging out

This bald, baby chihuahua who is missing most of his teeth and can't stop his tongue hanging out is definitely in the running for the ugliest dog in the country. 

But owner Sarah Andrews, 29, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, insists she wouldn't change him one bit.

She adopted the chihuahua cross after he was attacked by other pets at his previous owner's home - and gave him the name Fugly  because of his odd look.

She said: 'Fugly is bald with only a little fur on his tail and stubble on his head.

'He has very few teeth and has only one fang has grown the wrong way. 

'His tongue only comes out the side so drinking anything normally lands up splashed over his head.

'He is a lovely little boy who loves attention and got a lovely tan in the summer but almost goes grey in the winter.'

She added that when Fugly goes for walks he has to wear doggy clothes to keep him warm.

'He really is just a cheeky chappy, and my son Connor loves playing with him,' she said.

'Fugly does get quite a lot of comments when he goes on walks, especially from people who see him for the first time.

She explains that people think she dresses him up for fun but actually Fugly needs clothes due to his lack of fur

'People are normally quite shocked, and I do get quite defensive about him.

'People think I dress him up for fun, but he really does need it because he does not have much fur.

'He has such a cute personality and he really is quite cute and adorable. He loves being around people.

'If you put him in a blanket on the floor, he will want to be on your lap. He loves being around the family.'

And Sarah, whose son Connor loves playing with 'cute and adorable' Fugly says she wouldn't change him
