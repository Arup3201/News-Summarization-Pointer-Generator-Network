Former footballer turned property guru Gary Neville is set to re-develop an iconic police station in Manchester.

Neville and ex-team-mate Ryan Giggs have formed a consortium to build offices, bars, restaurants and a four or five-star hotel around the historic Bootle Street station, off Deansgate, in partnership with the council.

Bootle Street itself is being bought up by the town hall for more than £2m as the final piece in the jigsaw - so that detailed plans for the multimillion pound regeneration of the area can be drawn up, including the re-development of the Manchester Reform Synagogue and vacant Sir Ralph Abercombie pub.

It is the latest in a series of major property ventures by former United defender Neville, who is currently building Hotel Football in partnership with Giggs at Old Trafford.

That is due to open later this year. But this could be his biggest project yet - a redevelopment said to be worth £140m.

His consortium, the Jacksons Row Development Company, has already bought - or is in the final stages of buying - the other various parts of the 300sq ft parcel of land between Albert Square and Deansgate, including the synagogue on Jackson's Row.

Following the end of his playing career, Neville agreed a deal to sign for Sky Sports as a pundit ahead of the 2012/13 season.

On May 14, 2012, Neville was appointed to the coaching team by England boss Roy Hodgson.

Is part of a group of five ex-Manchester United players, brother Phil, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, who run Salford City FC. They play in the Evo-Stik Northern Premier First Division North.

In 2010, Neville announced plans to develop an 'eco-home', but was forced to abandon plans due to 'neighbour unrest' in 2012.

Is now pressing on with plans, along with Giggs and Jacksons Row Development Company, to redevelop areas of Deansgate, Manchester.

It already has a major luxury hotel operator on board.

But the station was the one remaining element of the package and until now was in the hands of Greater Manchester Police.

The council has been in purchase negotiations with the police commissioner for months and has now agreed a deal, meaning the whole project can start.

The station had been the city's policing HQ for 80 years when it closed earlier this month as part of plans to save money.

We revealed in 2010 how the building, once described by former chief constable Michael Todd as 'far better suited as a set for Life on Mars', was due to be axed.

Earlier this summer officers finally moved out and into the town hall, where they now have a 24-hour policing post.

Currently it is unclear which of the existing buildings on the Jackson's Row site would remain - although Bootle Street's facade may remain even if the main part of the station is demolished. Further details of the development are expected in the autumn.

A spokesman for the consortium said: 'This is an exciting regeneration opportunity in a significant location which we believe will add to the vibrancy of Manchester city centre.'
