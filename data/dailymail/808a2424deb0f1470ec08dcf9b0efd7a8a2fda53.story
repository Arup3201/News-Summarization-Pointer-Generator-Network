A decade ago the Slovakian handball player Maros Kolpak laughed out loud when this reporter told him his name had become synonymous with a new species of county cricketer. The news that ‘Kolpak’ may now be considered a term of racist abuse is unlikely to attract the same response.

Certainly, no-one at Yorkshire — whose captain, Andrew Gale, finds himself at the centre of a racism storm — is laughing.

According to reports, as yet not denied, Gale told Lancashire’s South African batsman Ashwell Prince during a recent County Championship match at Old Trafford to: ‘F*** off back to your own country, you Kolpak f*****.’

He now must appear before a disciplinary hearing next week to answer a charge of racial verbal abuse. He is said to be devastated. 

Legal constraints mean both the ECB and Yorkshire are staying tight-lipped about the details. But a truism still applies: a charge of racism is far easier to make than it is to prove. It is also a scar that cannot be removed. People are not dubbed racist: they are branded.

Gale’s outburst was unpleasant, even if it turns out to be the case that he was provoked by Prince. The best that can be said about telling someone to go back to their own country — whether or not it is spiced up by swear words or fuelled by adrenaline — is that it is deeply crass.

Throw in the Kolpak jibe — a reference to cricketers from outside the EU who play domestically in England without adding to a county’s overseas quota — and it could be argued that Gale insulted Prince on the grounds of his ‘national origin’, one of the terms of reference in the ECB’s code of conduct. 

Gale's County Championship title celebrations were affected by the accusations

But racism? Even those minded to take extra offence because of Prince’s ethnicity — he is mixed race — might concede it cannot possibly be that straightforward. 

If Gale’s intention was to lambast Prince because he felt he was taking up a place in the county game that might otherwise have gone to a promising English youngster, then his sledge arguably contained a crude logic. Yet it should be clear that to agree with Gale’s sentiment is not to condone racism. 

The ECB need to tread carefully. On the day Gale clashed with Prince, Moeen Ali — a Birmingham-born Muslim of Pakistani heritage — was jeered by Indian fans during a one-day international at Edgbaston. Five days later, during a Twenty20 international at the same venue, he was subjected to a second dose of mindlessness. 

The newly-crowned champions immediately vowed to fight to clear the name of their captain Gale

The ECB said almost nothing, save to ‘condemn abusive language or behaviour of any sort at cricket’. It is not an immediately reassuring approach that glosses over cat-calling by several thousand spectators while zeroing in on the less clear-cut motivation of an individual cricketer. It is tempting to conclude that some targets are easier than others.

This is about more than semantics, and about more than the precise nature of what prompted Gale to say what he did, which we can never know for sure. It’s about the importance of not diminishing the awfulness of racism for those who can claim, without hesitation or legal argument, to have been its victim.

Call Gale misguided, if you like. Call him thoughtless. But if you’re going to suggest he’s racist, you should be armed with more than a smart lawyer to prove your point.
