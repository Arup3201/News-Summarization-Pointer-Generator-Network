With the Christmas party season in full swing and New Year's Eve just around the corner, finding the perfect dress is never easy - or cheap.

That is exactly why one designer has created the ultimate versatile party dress that can be worn fifty different ways to suit any occasion.

American designer Nadia Tarr claims that her Butter by Nadia dress is your one-stop solution for any wardrobe crisis.

The perfect Christmas party season dress? Nadia Tarr, whose designs are favoured by the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker, has created the dress that can be worn 50 ways

The dress, which can be purchased in various lengths and colours, can be transformed simply by adjusting the material straps.  

The wraparound straps can be tied in different ways around your waist or neck to create a halter, one shoulder or strapless style.

The garment, which is similar in style to the Duchess of Cambridge's Issa engagement gown, retails for £299 on Nadia's website.

But if your budget doesn't stretch that far, it can be rented from designer dress hire site, girlmeetsdress.com, for £59 for two nights or £69 for seven nights.

How will you wear yours? The dress can be worn an impressive 50 different ways depending on your mood and the occasion. Here are 12 of the styles, showing how they look from the front and the back

One size fits all: The dresses are constructed using rayon and spandex and one size is said to fit size 6-16

The dresses are constructed using rayon and spandex, which the brand says allows the jersey to maintain its shape, quality and comfort.

Thanks to its stretchy design, it only comes in one size, which claims to fit size 6 up to 16.

'Fashion
 changes so much and the Butter by Nadia dresses allow you to gain 
access to your dream wardrobe for all of life's special occasions: a 
ball, a birthday party, a romantic date.

'A halter maxi dress to one event, and a strapless gown to the next - different crowd, different place, different you,' say Girl Meets Dress in their description of the gown.

'Pair with wedges or ballet pumps for a contemporary day look. For night, amp up the glamour with high sandals and dazzling crystal jewellery,' they advise.

Anna Bance, founder of Girl Meets Dress, said: 'Our image shows just 12 of the most popular ways in which you can wear this dress.

'Our customers get very creative because there are in fact endless options! It's really fun to experiment with the long ties and find a style you love.'

Nadia Tarr is a former dancer and choreographer turned fashion designer whose jersey dresses have been worn by the likes of Sarah Jessica Parker and Naomi Watts.

Style it up: Girl Meets Dress advise fashionistas to pair the dress - which is available in differing lengths - with wedges or ballet pumps for a contemporary day look and glam it up with dazzling jewels and heels at night

Work it: The dress can be worn as a halter maxi dress or a strapless gown depending on the occasion
