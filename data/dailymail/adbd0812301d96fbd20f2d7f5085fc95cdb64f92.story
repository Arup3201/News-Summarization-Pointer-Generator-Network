David Cameron moved last night to crush a bid to hold a referendum on British membership of the EU next year as the Tories were pitched into fresh turmoil on Europe.

Tory backbencher Adam Afriyie, who has been accused of plotting against Mr Cameron, announced plans to table an amendment to legislation which paves the way for a promised vote in 2017.

The Prime Minister has pledged to hold an in-out referendum after renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels following the next election, if he wins.

But Mr Afriyie – who is reputed to have 25 supporters lined up for a future leadership bid – said the public was ‘not convinced’ Mr Cameron would stick to his promise.

He revealed he will give MPs the chance to vote for a referendum in 2014 instead when Tory James Wharton’s referendum bill is debated next on November 8.

In an article for the Mail on Sunday, he wrote: ‘Only by setting an early date can we kick-start EU renegotiation talks and give the British people what they so clearly want – a say on our country’s future with Europe.’

Mr Wharton warned that his bill – which is backed by Downing Street – could be ‘killed’ if the amendment is debated since backbench bills get very little parliamentary time, allowing Labour to talk it out.

‘I’d like to see my bill go through and I think this harms the chances of that happening,’ he said.

The amendment is also a major headache for Mr Cameron since the 81 Tory MPs who previously rebelled over a referendum will now come under huge pressure to back the plan for an early vote.

Senior Tories accused Mr Afriyie of seeking to ‘destabilise’ the Prime Minister ‘at any cost’ and branded him a ‘fantasist’ with ‘little grip on reality’.

A No 10 source said: ‘We will not allow this amendment to be passed under any circumstances. The PM will not let it stand’.

Home Secretary Theresa May warned that Mr Afriyie had ‘got it wrong’.

Prominent Eurosceptics privately expressed anger that they may be forced to choose between wrecking Mr Wharton’s bill, which they support, and voting against a referendum for which they have campaigned for years.

MPs privately expressed incredulity that Mr Afriyie appeared not to have discussed the plan with any of the leading Eurosceptics.

Philip Davies, who launched the Better Off Out group in 2006, spoke for many: ‘Should there be a vote, I would be compelled to support it since it’s something I have campaigned for all my career.

‘However, I’ve never known Adam Afriyie care about the subject in his life. It’s totally self-indulgent behaviour. He’s going to put lots of my colleagues in a very difficult position.’

If Mr Afriyie had hoped to use his gambit to boost his chances of succeeding Mr Cameron, it appeared to have failed, with Tory MPs queuing up to condemn his grandstanding.

Labour’s Tom Watson and Keith Vaz both backed an early referendum but Ed Miliband’s aides refused to say whether he will vote with his conscience to oppose a vote or seek to inflict a tactical victory on Mr Cameron.

‘We will respond to the amendment after it has been published,’ a source said.

Nick Clegg will lay into the Tories this week, using a speech on Europe to warn that Mr Cameron’s EU referendum promise is ‘deeply flawed and bound to unravel’.

But UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage backed an early referendum.
