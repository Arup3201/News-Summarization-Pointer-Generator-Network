Barratts Priceless, one of Britain's best-known shoe chains, will axe 1,600 jobs after attempts to find a buyer for the concessions business failed, administrators said today.

It was announced last week that nearly 200 jobs were being lost with the closure of 18 stores in the UK and Ireland.

Administrator Deloitte said today it had been unsuccessful in finding a buyer for the concession business, meaning eight times as many jobs will be lost.

Going under: Around 1,600 jobs will go at shoe retailer Barratts Priceless, but mostly affect concessions

The firm will continue to trade the 
remaining 173 stores as it sought a buyer for all or parts of the 
Bradford-based business as a going concern.

The concessions are mainly in Dorothy Perkins and Outfit stores.

The administrators said failure to find a buyer for the concessions 'will unfortunately result in redundancies of Barratts Priceless staff across units in the UK and the Republic of Ireland'.

Daniel Butters, joint administrator and partner in Deloitte's restructuring services practice, said: 'Following a marketing of the Barratts Priceless businesses it is clear that a satisfactory sale of the concession to a new party will not be achieved.

Jobs under threat are mostly working on concessions at stores like Dorothy Perkins and Outfit

Under owner Stylo, Barratts and Priceless survived being put into administration in 2009 when 220 of its 380 stores closed

'Accordingly, the joint administrators have regretfully had to make approximately 1,610 Barratts Priceless Group full and part- time employees working in the various concessions redundant.'

The joint administrators are in conversation with the various concessionaires to see how many of the affected people they could either employ or absorb into their existing businesses.

They are also in active discussions to rescue a significant part of the remaining business, they added.

It was announced last Wednesday that 18 stores would shut two days later.

Online retailer Hawkin's Bazaar said it had collapsed into administration, putting nearly 400 jobs at risk

Five Barratts and 13 Priceless stores were closing last Friday, with the loss of 127 jobs, and a further 60 staff members at the head office in Bradford, West Yorkshire, were also being made redundant.

The shoe chain collapsed into administration earlier this month, after unseasonably mild weather further exacerbated already difficult trading conditions.

Amid the many shoe factories of  Northampton, William Barratt started his mail order company.

W Barratt & Co invited customers to 'Walk the Barratt Way' in advertisements that first appeared in 1903 in the Carpenter and Builder journal.

The company's Boots-by-Post service boasted that it sold 'the World’s Best Brogues at Barratt's Factory Price'.

In 1913, Mr Barratt built the W Barratt Footshape works, designed to look more like a big country house than a factory.

The company flourished to the extent that in 1964 it was bought by rival shoe company Stylo and made the firm’s principle brand.

In 2008, Stylo – which had been founded in 1917 by Fanny Ziff, a 27-year-old Russian immigrant – purchased 24 stores from collapsed retailer Dolcis and rebranded them as Barratts.

But in 2009, Stylo put Barratts and its other brand Priceless shoes into administration, with 220 of its 380 stores closed down.

The remaining 160 stores were bought by current Barratts owner Michael Ziff, former chairman of Stylo and a descendant of its founder.

Also today, the owner of Hawkin's Bazaar said it had collapsed into administration, putting nearly 400 jobs at risk.

Zolfo Cooper was appointed as 
administrator of Tobar, which owns Hawkin's, as well as toys and 
children’s accessories retailer Letterbox, and its wholesale, mail 
order, and online businesses.

The group employs 380 full-time staff
at its 65 permanent stores and at its head office in Beccles, Suffolk, 
which are now in jeopardy as the retailer seeks to sell all or part of 
the business.

The business will continue to be traded 
as a going concern by the administrator but a further 55 'pop-up' 
Hawkin's stores, which opened over Christmas and employ some 400 
temporary staff, will be closed in coming days in line with its previous
plans.

Hawkin's was set up in 1973 and sells unusual toys, gifts, games, gadgets and curiosities.

It describes its offer as 'things you thought had gone forever, things you never even knew existed'.

A spokesman for Zolfo said: 'The directors have worked very hard to turn the business around but have concluded that administration is the best route forward.'

Hawkin’s collapse, following the crucial Christmas trading period, comes after D2 Jeans appointed administrators earlier this week.

There are fears that many more chains could fold in coming weeks as businesses are sunk by their quarterly rent demands from landlords amid tough trading conditions.

Lingerie chain La Senza, originally set up by Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, is also expected to appoint administrators in coming days, and there is speculation Blacks Leisure will meet a similar end after it put itself up for sale.
