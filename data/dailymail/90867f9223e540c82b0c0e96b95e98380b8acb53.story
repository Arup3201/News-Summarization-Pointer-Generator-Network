Sales of $1 million homes are booming, even as overall sales have sputtered this year.

It's further evidence of how the nearly six-year economic recovery has favored the wealthy. 

Those with epic stock portfolios, superb credit and cash to spare are snapping up estates, pied-a-terres and beachside cottages. Some of this shopping spree comes courtesy of the Standard & Poor's 500 climbing an additional 13 percent this year, while mortgage rates had slid below 4 percent and made it much easier to borrow.

The real estate brokerage Redfin recently reported that sales of properties costing more $1 million climbed 9 percent year-over-year, based on data from the July to October quarters. Overall sales slipped 1.2 percent.

Going farther: In St. Louis, Missouri, $1.385million buys this incredible Beau Arts mansion in the heart of one of the city's wealthiest neighborhoods

The home boasts four bedrooms, five bathrooms and nearly 8,000 square feet of living space

The mansion also boasts an in-ground pool and a sprawling patio

These luxury homes are ascendant even though they represent less than 3 percent of the market. More than 60 percent of the US homes sold in November cost less than $250,000 — and their sales have tumbled over the past 12 months, the National Association of Realtors said last week. 

Analysts believe the rush to buy luxury homes comes from the super-wealthy who are flush with cash from the booming stock market.

Many of the buyers are foreign investors from China, Canada, Europe or South America who are looking for a place to park some cash - and also a place to vacation in the United States, CNBC reports. 

It's no surprise then, that sales of luxury homes are booming in major tourist destinations - New York, Miami, Los Angeles.
