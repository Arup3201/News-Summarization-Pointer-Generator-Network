Ailing holiday giant Thomas Cook has reassured its customers that their holidays are ‘in safe hands’ after it received an extra £100 million lifeline from its banks last week. But the firm may still have to close 200 of its 1,100 UK travel shops and axe 1,000 jobs in a bid to reduce its huge debt mountain.

Facing the axe: Thomas Cook may have to close up to 200 of its UK travel agencies in a bid to slash costs

The group launched a publicity drive this week amid fears that negative headlines may have deterred holidaymakers from booking with the company.The debt-laden firm saw UK bookings plunge by 30 per cent last week amid uncertainty over the group’s future.Thomas Cook’s interim chief executive Sam Weihagen will publish a letter in national newspapers from tomorrow saying it is safe to book breaks with the group.

Mr Weihagen's letter will begin: ‘What a week it has been for Thomas Cook,’ adding that it is now ‘an even stronger and more confident company’ and members of the public 'can be sure that your holiday really is in safe hands’.His words will play on the 170-year-old company's history and will claim it is the ‘most recognised and established name in the industry’.The letter will add: ‘I have no doubt that we will still be in another 170 years and beyond.’

Dip in profits: The debt-laden firm saw UK bookings plunge by 30% last week

The company’s share price slumped by a massive 75 per cent in one day last week amid fears of an imminent collapse.But the shares rose 30 per cent today after the company announced an extra £100 million lifeline from its banks on Friday night.The £200 million funding headroom was approved by the company's syndicate of banks, which include Barclays, HSBC, RBS and UniCredit, and will last until April 30 2013.It will replace the £100 million short-term facility announced on October 21 2011.

James Hollins, an analyst at Evolution Securities, said the new lending facility had secured the company's short-term survival.He added: ‘The increased facility pushes current gross debt to £1.5 billion but fortunately all the bad press has come at a low point in the booking cycle and the group has the funds and time to restore partner and consumer confidence in its brand and survival.’Mr Weihagen suggested that the multi-million pound loan might have been repaid in full by this time next year.He admitted, however, that it ‘may take two to three years to come to an acceptable profitability’.However, he refused to be drawn on possible shop closures and speculation about thousands of job losses within the UK.He said only that the firm was evaluating its shop estate and making sure ‘the shops we do have operating are profitable’.

Sign of the times: Thomas Cook, which sells more than 22 million holidays a year in the UK, has suffered from the impact of the Arab spring

In the meantime, he added, new management had been put in place in the UK, where trade has been suffering.‘The UK business this year has not really performed as good as we had hoped and not as good as competitors have performed and that was a management issue so we have replaced the management in the UK and started a turnaround plan,' he said.‘I'm very confident that plan will make sure our UK business will return to a much better profitability over time.’The travel agency, which was founded in 1841 and sells more than 22 million holidays a year in the UK, was hit by a slowdown in trade due to weak consumer confidence and unrest in North Africa.The group has suffered from the impact of the Arab spring, which has hit bookings to Tunisia and Egypt, destinations popular with France and Russia respectively, as well as UK holidaymakers.
