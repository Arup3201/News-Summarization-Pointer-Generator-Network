Britain’s spending on legal aid dwarfs that of every other country in Europe, a report revealed yesterday.

At £2billion a year, it is 20 times the European average and more than seven times the amount spent by France or Germany.

The Government is pushing through controversial reforms to cut the bloated legal aid budget but the report, by the Council of Europe, warns that this could breach criminals’ human rights.

The Council, which covers human rights in 47 countries and oversees the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, found that the average spending per nation on legal aid in 2012 was £96million.

But for England and Wales the amount spent on providing free legal help was £2billion, way above the next highest, the Netherlands at £378million, France on £288million and Germany on £270million.

The figure for England and Wales works out at £32.55 per head of population – only Norway and Northern Ireland spend more. It was five times the European average of £6.76. France spent £4.39, Germany £3.36 and Spain just 62p. The Council of Europe’s 545-page study commented: ‘Decisions have been taken to reduce the budget of legal aid in England and Wales as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis, though such legal aid systems continue to be among the most generous in Europe.’

But it warned that cuts may not be ‘consistent with the requirement and spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights.’

Last year the Coalition slashed annual legal aid spending on civil and family cases by £350million.

Ministers have faced a wave of opposition from the legal profession over plans to strip a further £215million a year from criminal cases by 2018-19.

People with more than £37,500 of disposable income a year will no longer qualify for legal aid and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is forcing defence barristers in the most expensive criminal trials to accept cuts of nearly a third in publicly-funded fees.

Lawyers have staged a series of strikes and protests at the reforms, claiming justice could be undermined. Campaigners argue they will lead to a shortage of qualified defence lawyers. Earlier this year, a £5million fraud trial was halted when the Prime Minister’s brother, Alex Cameron QC, claimed the defendants could not get a fair trial as barristers were not willing to take on their defence for lowered fees. In May, however, the Appeal Court ruled it must go ahead.

The Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said the total spending on the judicial system in 2012 – around £4.3billion – worked out at less than £1.57 per person per week.

But Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: ‘With British taxpayers shelling out the highest amount of money on legal aid in Europe, the latest whinge from Strasbourg makes no sense. A cynic might say they are more worried about the gravy train of cases they feed off, than offering an accurate picture of our justice system.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We have always said that we had one of the most expensive legal aid systems.

‘In the challenging financial climate, we had to find ways of reducing the burden on hardworking taxpayers whilst still ensuring those most in need of a legally aided lawyer have access to one.

‘Our plans achieve that, and even after reform we will still have a very generous system at around £1.5billion a year.’

Figures released by the Ministry of Justice showed more than 1,000 lawyers are paid over £100,000 a year by taxpayers to appear in criminal courts.

The Council of Europe report found that the UK had one of the highest numbers of lawyers and questioned why our Supreme Court judges are among the highest paid.

In 2012 they earned £201,000 a year, nearly eight times the average UK salary.

The Council also pointed out a severe lack of women judges in the UK – in 2012 only Armenia and Azerbaijan had fewer.

In Slovenia, women make up 78 per cent of the judiciary, in Latvia 77 per cent and France 64 per cent. In Britain is it less than 25 per cent.
