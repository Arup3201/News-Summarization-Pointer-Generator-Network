Glamour: Former world number one Caroline Wozniacki who is currently starring in a campaign to promote her own lingerie range

She won seven Grand Slam titles and was once number two in the world.

So Ann Haydon-Jones is more than qualified to give her verdict on today’s tennis stars – and she’s not too impressed.

The 74-year-old former Wimbledon champion yesterday appeared to suggest some glamorous female players are happy to make money through advertising deals because they don’t have the talent to succeed on court.

Mrs Haydon-Jones made the comments 
about Caroline Wozniacki, who is currently starring in a high-profile 
campaign to promote her own lingerie range.

Asked
what she thought about the 22-year-old Dane using her beauty to secure 
sponsorship deals, Mrs Haydon-Jones replied: ‘Maybe she feels she can’t 
win the Grand Slams.

'Maybe
she accepts that she can’t and wants fame in a different direction.

'I 
think she probably would like to win a Grand Slam but I’m not sure she’s
good enough. ‘

Miss 
Wozniacki, who is dating golfer Rory McIlroy, was ranked number one in 
the world for 67 weeks, despite never having won a Grand Slam title.

She lost the top spot in January this year and is now ranked ninth.

Mrs Haydon-Jones won the French Open twice in the 1960s, and beat Billie Jean King to take the Wimbledon title in 1969.

Asked whether players such as Miss Wozniacki were driven in the right direction, she replied: ‘Part of me says they should get on with the game.

'I know my parents would have said that to me.

‘But part of me also says that, if you want to attract the spectators with some attractive players, it’s a good thing.’
