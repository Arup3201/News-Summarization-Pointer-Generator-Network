At the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Jackie Kennedy begged her husband not to send her to safety in the event of a nuclear attack, previously unreleased interviews have revealed.

The same interviews also highlighted her criticisms of Indira Gandhi, sister-in-law Eunice Shriver and 'egomaniac' Charles de Gaulle as well as captured her calling late brother-in-law Joe Jr 'unimaginative' compared to her husband.

When the First Lady discovered that the Soviets were installing missiles in Cuba targeting U.S. cities in October 1962, Mrs Kennedy pleaded with her husband to remain by his side.

In interviews recorded 47 years ago, the
 newly-widowed former first lady describes how she would lie down next 
to JFK when he took a nap and go for walks with him as America stared 
down the barrel of a nuclear war.

She said she told him: 'If anything happens, we're all going to stay right here with you.

'I just want to be with you, and I want to die with you, and the children do, too - than live without you.'

The interviews, titled Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations on Life with John F. Kennedy and due to be released on Wednesday to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Kennedy-era administration, were made with historian and former White House aide Arthur Schlesinger Jr in her 18th century Washington home in 1964.

In them, she makes virtually no mention of her husband's assassination on November 22, 1963. JFK's health problems and extra-marital affairs were also still years from public knowledge.

Mrs Kennedy reveals she enjoyed having her husband 'proud of her', saw no reason to have a policy opinion that wasn't the same as his and laughed at the thought of 'violently liberal women' who preferred the more effect Adlai Stevenson to her husband.

She said: 'Jack so obviously demanded from a woman - a relationship between a man and a woman where a man would be the leader and a woman be his wife and look up to him as a man.

'With Adlai you could have another relationship where - you know, he'd sort of be sweet and you could talk, but you wouldn't ever... I always thought women who were scared of sex loved Adlai.'

The interviews also touch on the legacy left by the Kennedy family in U.S. politics and the effect it had within the family itself.

She dismissed the idea that the eldest Kennedy son, Joseph Jr, would have been president if he had not been killed in World War Two.

'He would have been so unimaginative, compared to Jack,' she said.

And she commented on the ambition with the Kennedy clan, contrasting the integrity of Robert F. Kennedy - the president's brother and attorney general - with the designs of her sister-in-law Eunice Kennedy Shriver.

Robert Kennedy had begged JFK not to appoint him, fearing charges of nepotism.

Eunice Kennedy, however, was anxious to see her husband Sargent Shriver, named head of the department of Health, Education and Welfare.

Jackie told Mr Schlesinger: 'Eunice was pestering Jack to death to make Sargent head of HEW because she wanted to be a cabinet wife.

Jackie had unkind words for Indira Gandhi, calling her a 'prune - bitter, kind of pushy, horrible woman' and Charles de Gaulle, whom she called 'spiteful' and an 'egomaniac'

Jackie also said her late brother-in-law Joe Kennedy Jr would not have been very imaginative as president when compared to husband Jack

'You know, it shows you some people are ambitious for themselves and Bobby wasn't.'

Mrs Kennedy also had harsh words for overseas diplomats.

She referred to French president Charles de Gaulle, whom she famously charmed on a visit to Paris, as 'that egomaniac' and 'that spiteful man'.

While she thought Indira Gandhi, the future prime minister of India, was a 'prune - bitter, kind of pushy, horrible woman.'

The interviews also reveal Mrs Kennedy's
 loathing for black civil rights leader Martin Luther King, who she 
described as a 'terrible man' and a 'phoney'.

And they cover JFK's fears over his vice-president Lyndon Johnson succeeding him in office.

Jackie said sister-in-law Eunice Shriver, Maria's mom, wanted her husband made head of HEW so she could be a cabinet wife

She said her husband would say to her: 'Oh, God, can you ever imagine what would happen to the country if Lyndon were president?

'And Bobby told me that he'd had some discussions with him... do something to name someone else in 1968.'

Mrs Kennedy preferred others in her 
husband's administration, calling Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg 
'brilliant'.

But she added: 'He talks more about himself than any man 
I've ever met in my life.'

Meanwhile White House speechwriter Theodore Sorensen 
had a 'big inferiority complex' and was 'the last person you would 
invite at night.'

In June, an extract of one of the interviews had Mrs Kennedy saying her husband felt his legacy would be secured if he was assassinated after his Cuban missile crisis success of 1962.

'If anyone's going to kill me, it should happen now,' he supposedly said.

Professor Robert Dallek, a Kennedy era historian, has said JFKâ€™s remark may have been inspired by the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

JFK was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.
