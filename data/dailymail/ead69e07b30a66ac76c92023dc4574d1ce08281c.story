A biopic of 19th century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte could see the light of day five decades after the idea was originally conceived - as a television series.

It may have proved to be Stanley Kubrick's Waterloo, but Steven Spielberg has revealed that he plans to develop a television version of the late director's biopic of Napoleon which never made it onto the big screen.

Kubrick had meticulously planned the project, which he predicted would be 'the greatest movie ever made' but dropped it in the 1970s when he couldn't secure funding.

Ambitious project: Director Steven Spielberg has said that he will produce a television series of Stanley Kubrick's unrealised biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte

The Lincoln director spoke of his plans in an interview on French television channel Canal Plus.

He said he will collaborate on the project with Kubrick's family, though it is unclear whether the series is already being developed.

Spielberg collaborated with his friend Kubrick on AI: Artificial Intelligence, which he released two years after Kubrick's 1999 death.

That idea had been thought up by Kubrick, regarded as one of the greatest directors of all time, in the 1970s, but wasn't released until 2001 when Spielberg had written and directed it.

The Shining director Kubrick originally wrote a first draft of a screenplay for a film about the life of Napoleon in 1961 after scouring more than 18,000 documents and books about the historic political leader.

According to the Independent, he even sent one of assistant directors on 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey to search for appropriate locations to shoot the film.

Photographs were taken in Austerlitz and Waterloo as well as the island of Elba where Napoleon was exiled in 1814.

According to letters exhibited in Los Angeles last year, some of the big acting names of the day, including Oskar Werner and Audrey Hepburn were approached by Kubrick to take on the film project's main roles, though Hepburn declined.

A letter written by the director in 1971 to studio executives read: 'It's impossible to tell you what I'm going to do except to say that I expect to make the best movie ever made.'

The project very nearly got the go ahead following the release of 2001, but was shelved again in 1970 for Kubrick to make A Clockwork Orange.

But despite that setback, the director still vowed to shoot his project.

A Clockwork Orange author Anthony Burgess was enlisted to write a novel on Napoleon for Kubrick to base his movie on.

But even though the novel, Napoleon Sympthony, was published in 1974, the film project remained grounded.

With studios reluctant to provide funding, Kubrick eventually abandoned the project.

Spielberg, who was recently nominated in the Best Director category at the Academy Awards for Lincoln, is said to currently be working on a Second World War drama for HBO with Tom Hanks.

He was announced last week as the president of the jury for this year's Cannes Film Festival.

Stanley Kubrick was known for exerting complete artistic control over his projects. An American, Kubrick settled at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire.

His film credits include Lolita, Dr Strangelove, Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket.

He died from a heart attack in his sleep aged 70 just days after shooting a final scene for Eyes Wide Shut starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

Approached: Kubrick had Audrey Hepburn, left, and Oskar Werner, right, in mind for the film's top roles according to archive letters, though Hepburn had already declined

Napoleon Bonaparte

Napoleon Bonaparte was born to a family of gentry in Corsica in 1769.

After being educated at military school, Napoleon rose through the ranks and became commander of the French army in Italy.

He conquered Egypt in 1798 but his army was left stranded when his fleet was destroyed at the Battle of the Nile in 1798.

As France faced turmoil, a coup d'etat saw Napoleon become First Consul of France in November 1799 and by 1804 he had become Emperor.

During his reign he created the Bank of France, reinstated the Catholic Church as the state religion in France and reformed French law with the Napoleonic Code.

He abandoned plans to invade Britain after a defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 but went on to conquer large parts of Europe.

But the Peninsular War begun in 1808 and five years of battle left French military resources depleted.

The French invaded Russia in 1812 but were disastrously forced to retreat.

Paris fell two years later and Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba. He escaped exile in March 1815 and regained power briefly but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo.

Napoleon was imprisoned by the British on the island of St Helena and died in May 1821.
