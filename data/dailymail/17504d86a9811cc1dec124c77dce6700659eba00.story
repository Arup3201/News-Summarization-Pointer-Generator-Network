A Russian driver was presumably left dazed and confused after he was attacked by a group dressed as cartoon characters including Mickey Mouse and Spongebob SquarePants in a bizarre road rage incident.

Footage of the incident, which shows the driver as he stops his vehicle in front of a minibus in the middle of the road, has now become an internet hit.

The unverified footage, filmed on another vehicle's dashboard camera, apparently shows the driver as he gets out of his vehicle and appears to remonstrate with the driver of the minibus.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO 

The group dressed up as cartoon characters can be seen sneaking around the side of the minibus before confronting the driver who has apparently stopped in front of the minibus and got out of his vehicle

The group soon get the better of the driver, who falls to the floor

Before long however he finds himself outnumbered as four people dressed as cartoon characters, including Scrat from Ice Age and a Russian character called Luntik, sneak around the side of the minibus before confronting him.

The group then appears to proceed to get the better of the driver as they force him to the ground and begin kicking and punching him.

Following the attack, which lasts for about 15 seconds, the group appear to get back into the van before it drives off.

The man slowly gets back to his feet and makes his way back to his vehicle as the vehicle from which the incident has been filmed drives past and continues on its way.

The video is believed to have taken place at about 2.30am on Saturday morning in the Russian city of Chelyabinsk. 

It is not known however whether the video is authentic or  an elaborate prank.

They then make their escape as the man slowly gets up from the ground. It is not known whether the video is a prank but it has reportedly been watched more than 1.5 million times since it was uploaded online

According to The Moscow Times, the video has been watched more than 1.5 million times since it was uploaded to YouTube with the title 'Rough Chelyabinsk Disney'.

Another piece of dashcam footage from Russia which has become an internet hit recently shows a drunk woman struggling to stand upright as she makes her way home from the shops.

The footage, filmed on a car's dashboard camera as it pulls into a parking space in Belgorod, a city in western Russia, shows the smartly-dressed woman walking in a strange manner before she starts to sway from side to side.

With a shopping bag in one hand and a handbag in the other to balance her, the woman starts to stagger in circles as she begins the struggle to stay upright before falling over into a parked car.
