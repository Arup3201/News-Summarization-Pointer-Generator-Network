The scene: Witnesses at the trial recalled the 'ferocity' of the shootout between police and Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and the court was shown pictures of bullet casings and evidence strewn across the street

The video was shown on Tuesday at his trial in federal court in Boston.

In the video, the brothers can be seen at the Manchester Gun Range.

According to documentation that was presented during the trial, the brothers shot 9mm pistols for about an hour, Boston.com reported.

The brothers rented a Glock 17 and Glock 34 and bought four boxes of  ammunition from the range. 

The guns were similar to the Luger pistol (pictured) that was used to murder MIT Police Officer Sean Collier

Dzhokhar, now 21, paid the entire $170.75 bill himself, according to a receipt.

Both brothers wrote they had an 'intermediate' level of experience with pistols and they were not suffering mental illness or users of illegal drugs, WMUR reported. 

In the footage, Dzhokhar appears to be wearing the same black Adidas sweatshirt he was captured in on April 19, 2013 in Watertown, Massachusetts.

In addition to Collier, the brothers are accused of killing restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, graduate student Lingzi Lu, 23, and eight-year-old Martin Richard.

If found guilty, Dzhokhar faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.

He could also be executed as he is being prosecuted under the federal death penalty statute.
