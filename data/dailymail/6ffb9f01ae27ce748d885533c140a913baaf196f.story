When these three walkers went up Thack Moor, it was categorically a hill.

By the time they came down, they were convinced it was a mountain... and not just because their legs were tired.

At 1,998ft, the Cumbrian hill used to be  just shy of the 2,000ft (609.6 metres)  required by Ordnance Survey to be given mountain status.

Armed with GPS technology, friends 
John Barnard, Graham Jackson and Myrddyn Phillips worked out that it was
in fact about three quarters of an inch over the limit, so it is 
actually 609.62m.

Elevation: Thack Moor in the Cumbrian Pennines has now been reclassified as a mountain after three ramblers measured it with GPS equipment

Mountain-makers: Mr Phillips, Mr Jackson and Mr Barnard on the summit of Thack Moor

Ordnance Survey has since checked 
their data and confirmed it will amend its maps and listings to make 
Thack Moor England’s 254th mountain.

Their achievement has echoes of the 1995 Hugh Grant film The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill But Came Down A Mountain.

Grant’s character, a cartographer, infuriates a Welsh village by measuring their hill at just below mountain status.

The villagers respond by building an earth cairn on the top to increase its height.

Peak: The view from the summit of Thack Moor. The trio's data was corroborated by Ordnance Survey

Mr Barnard, 63, and Mr Jackson, 62, are retired research chemists from North Wales and Cheshire. 
Together with Mr Phillips, a 53-year-old former print firm manager who 
lives near Shrewsbury, they have measured more than 100 hills in  
England, Scotland and Wales in five years, spending around £5,000 on 
Leica GPS survey equipment.

Thack Moor is the second they have 
turned into a mountain.

The first, in 2008, was Snowdonia’s Mynydd 
Graig Goch. Mr Jackson said: ‘We have been keen hillwalkers for many 
years and we got talking about the height of some of the hills and  
modern GPS technology available and decided to give surveying a go.’

They first walked up Thack Moor, near
the village of Renwick, last August. After making their first 
measurement they returned last month to double check it and came up with
an identical reading.

Mark Greaves, of Ordnance Survey, 
said: ‘Because the software that we have available is far better and 
[more] advanced than what they were using, we have been able to come up 
with a definitive answer and have been able to confirm their 
measurements.

‘Their reading of 609.62m is to 
within two centimetres either way, which means at worst Thack Moor is 
2,000ft and it could even be an inch-and-a-half higher than that.

Before and after: The old OS map (left) shows Thack Moor at 609m tall, while it's true height of 610m is displayed in the new one

Accurate: The men used GPS equipment to measure the height of the mountain

The group's reading topped the magic mountain mark of 2,000ft by just three-quarters-of-an-inch

Intrepid: Mr Jackson and Mr Barnard on the ascent of Thack Moor

Mr Jackson added: 'We bought a surveyor's level and 
staff to measure height differences and a GPS Leica system that is 
essentially a big pole with an antennae on top.

'Generally, we look at maps and look for hills that are close to the 609 metre mark and then go and measure it.

'We had Thack Moor on our to-do list for some time, it was just a matter of meeting up and doing it.'

'It took us quite a while to find the
absolute highest point of Thack Moor, which we did by taking various 
readings.

The summit is a patch a short grass and moss.

'We were a bit cautious when we took the first measurement because there was only two centimetres in it.

'After speaking to the Ordnance Survey they advised us to go back and check it again.We returned six months later and found the summit to within 20 inches of our first visit.'

In the film, villagers delay the cartographers' departure while they build an earth cairn on top of the hill to make it high enough to be a mountain

The film is set in 1917 and revolves around two English cartographers, Garrad and his junior, Anson (portrayed by Hugh Grant).

They arrive at the fictional Welsh village of Ffynnon Garw (translated as 'Rough Fountain' or 'Rough Spring' in Welsh) to measure its 'mountain'

The village is horrified when the two men tell them it is merely a hill as it is just short of the required height.

The villagers delay the cartographers' departure while they build an earth cairn on top of the hill to make it high enough.

It is based on a story heard by director Christopher Monger from his grandfather about the real village of Taff's Well in Wales.

Thack Moor has been re-classified thanks to three ramblers

Similar to the plot of 1995 film The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill...

It is the second hill the amateur trio have raised to mountain status
