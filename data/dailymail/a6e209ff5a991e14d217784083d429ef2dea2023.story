Children are doing so little activity that their lives may be shorter as a result, a parliamentary report found yesterday.

Children are doing so little physical activity that their lives may be shorter as a result, a parliamentary report found yesterday

Half of seven-year-olds do not do any exercise on a regular basis, the report said.

It warned that lack of physical activity is a habit laid down in childhood – and is responsible for one in five premature deaths.

The report called for a Government-backed programme to encourage children into sport, outdoor play and walking or cycling, with the aim of encouraging them to carry on with physical activities throughout their lives.

According to the findings, only half of seven-year-olds engage in regular physical activity.

Over the past 50 years, the report said, the level of activity taken by Britons dropped by 20 per cent.

The report follows a series of evidence sessions conducted by the parliamentarians, led by former Paralympic racer Baroness Grey-Thompson.

It said inactivity is likely to increase and demanded publicly-funded campaigns to encourage exercise.

One of the group’s supporters, 2012 Olympic organiser Lord Coe, said: ‘Not many people are aware that physical inactivity currently accounts for nearly one-fifth of premature deaths in the UK.

'With projections showing that inactivity levels are due to increase by a further 15 per cent by 2030 there is no doubt that the issue requires immediate national attention and urgent action.

‘The report from the All-Party Commission on Physical Activity represents a true shift in how governments, NGBs, corporations, and the civil sector can work together in shaping the world’s perception of sport and physical activity.’

A public health campaign should concentrate of persuading people of the benefits of getting out of their chairs and taking some form of exercise, the report said.

It called for the production of a set of measure by which people can tell if they are getting enough exercise.

The report said people should be encouraged into physical activity both at work and in their spare time and that there should be efforts to press more people into walking and cycling to work.

It said that promoting physical education, sport and outdoor play among children could help make physical activity a lifelong habit.

The report suggested that illness caused by lack of exercise costs the economy £20billion a year.
