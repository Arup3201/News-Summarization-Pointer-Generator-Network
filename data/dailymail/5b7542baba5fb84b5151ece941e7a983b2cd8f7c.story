Eyebrows were raised when Andy Murray announced Amelie Mauresmo as his new coach on Sunday, ahead of his Wimbledon defence later this month.

And it hasn't taken the duo long to get down to business, as the British No. 1 practiced at Queen's Club on Wednesday.

Mauresmo won the women's singles title at SW19 in 2006 and as a grass court specialist is seen as the ideal coach to help Murray retain the Wimbledon crown he memorably won last year after defeating Novak Djokovic.

Murray won his first match of the grasscourt season against Paul Henri-Mathieu at Queen's Club on Wednesday, and the 27-year-old practiced on the morning of the match under the bright London sunshine and watchful eye of the Frenchwoman.

Mauresmo already appeared to be sharing her insight and experience with the Scot, having observed himt practice his serving and general play from a few meters back before handing out a tip or two during a drinks break.

Although Mauresmo's appointment came as a surprise, Sportsmail's Mike Dickson exclusively revealed last month that the two-time Grand Slam winner was set to become Murray's new coach.

Murray's long-term girlfriend Kim Sears was also present to meet Mauresmo and watch her man return to action after a crushing defeat in the semi-finals of the French Open to Rafael Nadal.

She took her usual place in the stands along with Mauresmo and the rest of Murray's team as the 27-year-old began his bid to retain his Queen's title.

Mauresmo replaces Ivan Lendl as Murray's coach after the Czech split from the British No. 1 in March following a successful two-year partnership.

Mauresmo enjoyed a glittering 15-year playing which ended in 2009 - with here best year coming in 2006 where she won Wimbledon and the Australian Open - her only slam victories.

AT SW19, Mauresmo's victory came off the back of serve and volley tennis and it's this expertise that has drawn Murray to appoint the Frenchwoman as his coach.

Aside from slam victories, she became the first French player to become World No. 1 in 2004 - despite having not won a major - and went on to gain a silver medal at the Athens Olympics.

It wasn't just Mauresmo's on court actions that received attention throughout the years.

The Frenchwoman came out as a lesbian at just 19 years old in 1999, a move which she admitted later was tough and led to jibes from fellow professionals Lindsey Davenport and Martina Hingis.

However, Mauresmo also claims that coming to terms with her sexuality was a vital part of her success on the court, a success that would transfer to coaching.

Mauresmo made her first entrance into coaching in 2010, guiding Michael Llodra, before then teaming up with then World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka two years later.

Her most notable coaching success came last year, in helping guide Marion Bartoli to the 2013 Wimbledon crown. It was Bartoli's first grand slam victory and it came without dropping a set.
