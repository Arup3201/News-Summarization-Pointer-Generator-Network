Liverpool are interested in Uruguay's latest striker prospect Jaime Baez.

The 19-year-old plays for Juventud in the Uruguayan Primera Division and has scored four goals in 13 games this season.

He has drawn predictable comparisons with Luis Suarez but is a forward who relies more on his pace than dribbling ability.

Baez has been a regular with Uruguay Under 20s but does not have a dual passport so would struggle for a work permit at this stage.

Inter Milan, AC and Juventus have also been alerted to the youngster's potential as have Ajax.

Liverpool, meanwhile, are also looking to bring in Real Salt Lake City forward Brooks Lennon in the New Year.

The 17-year-old has enjoyed a couple of trials with the Merseyside club over the past year and joined them on a pre-season tour but has yet to receive clearance to play in this country.

Lennon is a fast winger tipped to make a big impression by US national coach Jurgen Klinsmann.
