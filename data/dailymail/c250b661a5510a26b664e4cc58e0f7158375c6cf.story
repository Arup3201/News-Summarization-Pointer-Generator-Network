Princess Madeleine, the youngest child of the King of Sweden, and her husband, American banker Christopher O'Neill, have named their daughter Leonore Lilian Maria.

The name of the latest addition to the Swedish royal family was formally announced at a cabinet meeting held at the Royal Palace in Stockholm on Wednesday.

The infant princess, who was born Feb. 20 in New York, was also given the title of Duchess of Gotland.

At the cabinet meeting, King Carl XVI Gustaf informed the government of the princess’ name, which is highly unusual by Swedish standards.

There are only 128 women in Sweden with the name Leonore, 35 of whom use it as a first name.

The baby will be referred to as ‘Her Royal Highness’,  even though her American father declined to accept a title when he married Madeleine last June.

Princess Leonore, the second grandchild of the king and Queen Silvia, is officially fifth in line to the throne. Her mother, Princess Madeleine, 31, is fourth.

The baby will be christened in the royal palace church in Stockholm sometime this summer, the royal court said.

‘It's cute and exciting,’ Mistress of Robes Alice Trolle-Wachtmeister said at a press conference following the announcement, reported TheLocal.se.

‘Isn't it the trend in Sweden now to give unusual names? Not everyone can be called Pelle and Lisa.’

The baby's second name is believed to be in honor of Princess Lilian, who died in March 2013 at the age of 97.

Princess Lilian was born the daughter of a Welsh coal miner in 1915.

A model and actress, she met Prince Bertil of Sweden at a London nightclub during World War II.

They fell in love, but Bertil could not marry a commoner without giving up his rights to the throne.

The couple lived together for more than 30 years, during which Lilian behaved with great discretion and received no official recognition.

After the death of the old king, Gustaf VI Adolf, King Carl XVI Gustaf came to the throne and gave his uncle Bertil permission to marry his longtime companion. They married in 1976 and remained together until Bertil's death in 1987.

Sweden's king and queen had recently traveled to New York City to meet the newest addition to the royal family.

They met their new granddaughter for the first time on Saturday after the princess brought the healthy baby girl home from the hospital. The king and queen then headed to Bloomingdale's and Gracious Home for some shopping.

On Sunday, the royal couple met their son-in-law, American banker Christopher O'Neil, at Amaranth, a swanky restaurant on Manhattan's Upper East Side, for lunch.

Last week, Sweden honored the birth of the new addition to the monarchy with a 21-gun salute in Stockholm.

Thirty-one
 year old Madeleine, whose full title is Madeleine Therese Amelie 
Josephine, Princess of Sweden, Duchess of Halsingland and Gastrikland, 
daughter of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, and O'Neill wed in 
June in Stockholm.

Sweden has a constitutional monarchy 
in which the royals primarily serve as figureheads. The king is the 
country's head of state, but his powers are limited to ceremonial 
duties.

'The Office of 
the Marshal of the Realm is delighted to announce that H.R.H. Princess 
Madeleine gave birth to a daughter on February 20, 2014 at 10.41 pm 
local time New York,' the Swedish court said. 'Both mother and child are in good health.'

The
 baby was born at New York Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center, 
and O'Neill was at the hospital during the entire delivery.

Sweden's one-time 'party princess' 
lives with her American husband, 39, in New York where she works
 for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by her 
mother, Queen Silvia.

The couple met after Princess Madeleine fled to the U.S. in 2010 with a broken heart.

She
 crossed the Atlantic following the breakdown of her first engagement to
 Swedish attorney Jonas Bergstrom amid speculation that he had cheated 
on her.

Rumors of a 
romance with O'Neill first emerged in early 2011 when the pair were 
seen together at the Central Park Boathouse.

A source told the New York Post at the time: 'She is always happy when she is with him.'

Madeleine says she and her husband were friends first, and a relationship blossomed over time.
