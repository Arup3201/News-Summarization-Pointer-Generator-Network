He was behind some of Britain’s best-loved sitcoms, including Dad’s Army and Hi-de-Hi!

But despite his remarkable success, the late comedy writer David Croft has left little more than £226,000 in his will.

Croft, who died last year at  the age of 89, has left the entire estate in a trust for his family.

Its relatively modest value will 
surprise many given that Croft, who won a lifetime achievement gong at 
the British Comedy Awards in 2003, had a career of television hits which
spanned nearly four decades.

The father of seven, who lived in a farmhouse near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, joined the BBC as a comedy producer in the Sixties.

But it was a chance meeting with fellow comedy writer Jimmy Perry that was to transform his life. 

Croft also had a successful writing partnership with Jeremy Lloyd and the pair created ’Allo ’Allo! and Are  You Being Served?

It is believed Croft’s net UK estate of £226,363 did not include his holiday home in Portugal, where he died, or assets held jointly with wife Ann.

Dad’s Army, the duo’s first major 
creation, ran for nine series. They were also behind a string of other 
hits, including It Ain’t Half Hot Mum, Hi-de-Hi! and You Rang, M’Lord?

The series ran to 80 episodes over nine years from 1968 to 1977 and starred a cast including Arthur Lowe as pompous bank manager Captain Mainwaring and Clive Dunn as old soldier Lance Corporal Jones.

It regularly gained audiences of 18 million and in 2004, it was voted into fourth place in a BBC poll to find Britain’s Best Sitcom.

It spawned a full length feature film, a radio series and a stage show, attracted millions of viewers and is still regularly repeated.

Croft was born into showbusiness. His parents were both actors and he appeared in a cinema advert as a child, before landing a small part in a 1939 film of Goodbye, Mr Chips.

But the war intervened and a cinema career was put on hold while he served in the Royal Artillery, eventually rising to the rank of Major.

His wartime experience provided him with material and he returned to the era for three of his biggest shows - 'Allo 'Allo was set in Nazi-occupied France, It Ain't Half Hot Mum followed the adventures of an Army concert party in India and Burma and most famously Dad's Army centred on a Home Guard platoon in the fictional seaside town of Walmington-On-Sea.
