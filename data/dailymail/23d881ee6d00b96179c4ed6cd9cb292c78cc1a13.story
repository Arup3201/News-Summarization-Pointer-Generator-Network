A 55-year-old Baltimore grandfather has been charged with involuntary manslaughter after he accidentally left his 16-month-old granddaughter to die in his hot truck three months ago.

Sabriya Towles was discovered in her Anthony Jerome Towles' vehicle in Lansdowne in mid-July but her death was initially ruled an accident and the result of hyperthermia, the medical term for excessively high body temperatures.

But on October 5, more than three months later, authorities arrested Towles, who they say forgot to drop the infant at child care, instead leaving her in the car at their shared home while he went to have a nap.

Mark Cheshire, a spokesman for Baltimore State's Attorney Gregg L. Bernstein, declined to comment on the case but he told the Baltimore Sun that 'based on the evaluation of the evidence, this is the appropriate charge.'

Towles slept for four hours after returning home on July 5.

As time passed, the temperature rose to a blistering 88 degrees and even hotter inside the truck.

When he woke, he went to pick up his granddaughter at daycare.

'He had been told that the child was never dropped off in the morning. When he ran back out to his vehicle, he discovered that the child was unresponsive in the back seat,' Cathy Batton, of Baltimore County Police, told CBS Baltimore.

Police and fire units were called to the 4100 block of McDowell Lane just before 1 p.m.

The child was pronounced dead at St. Agnes Hospital.

Death: The grandfather parked the car at the family's home on South Paca Street, pictured, and slept for four hours before driving to pick up the little girl at daycare. It was only then he realized she had been in the vehicle all along

Donna Schindele of Brooklyn, Maryland, said her daughter, who is friends with Sabriya's mother, often baby-sat the little girl.

'It's a tragedy, and him being charged won't bring her back. But I don't understand how you can only drive two miles and forget you had a child in your vehicle,' Schindele told the Baltimore Sun.

Towles was released on $25,000 bond. He could receive a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison if convicted.

After her death, the distraught family set up a website to raise funds for the hospital fees and her funeral.
