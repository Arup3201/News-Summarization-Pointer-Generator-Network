Schalke 04 attacking midfielder Julian Draxler will be out for the rest of the year after picking up a thigh injury in their 1-0 win over Augsburg on Friday, the club said on Saturday.

Germany's talented World Cup winner lasted only 11 seconds from the start of the Bundesliga game, pulling a thigh muscle, with sports director Horst Heldt saying it looked serious.

'He was again injured and it looks like a serious muscle injury,' Heldt said. 'I do not expect Julian to play any more in this first half of the season.'

The news will come as a massive blow to new manager Roberto Di Matteo as the young attacking midfielder is an influential member of the Schalke side.

Draxler has been heavily linked with a move away from the Gelsenkirchen club in recent transfer windows with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger a keen admirer of the Germany international's talents. 

The 21-year-old is set to miss their remaining three Champions League group games plus Germany's Euro 2016 qualifier against Gibraltar and friendly against Spain next month.
