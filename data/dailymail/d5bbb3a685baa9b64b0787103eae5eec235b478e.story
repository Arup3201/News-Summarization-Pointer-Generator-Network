An explosive video posted online on Sunday shows two U.S. Marines confronting a man who they accuse of impersonating a military veteran at a funeral in Florida.

The Marines first suspected the man was likely an imposer because his uniform featured a mix of mismatched medals and ribbons.

After the service they approached the man, who identified himself as a ‘sergeant major’. His name badge states his surname as Davis.

One Marine quizzed the man about his service record, while the other filmed him on his cellphone.

Initially the conversation was relatively friendly as the Marines asked the man about where he had served as well as other details about his military service.

But the man appears nervous when answering and not only identifies himself as a ‘sergeant major,’ but also a military policeman and a special forces operator.

As the Marines grow increasingly suspicious the atmosphere turns tense as they decide to call the guy out for not knowing the correct uniform code, reports LiveLeak.

‘You know that’s called false valor? It is a federal crime for you to be wearing that uniform,’ one of the Marines tells the alleged impersonator.

‘No it’s not,’ the man replies. ‘You can get out my face right now… because I’m a military officer as well.’

When the Marines asked him where his MP card is, he claims it is in his car and then proceeds to leave as they continue to film him. The man never concedes that he is not who he says he is.

The incident happened last Saturday in West Palm Beach, Florida.

The video was posted on a Facebook page entitled U.S Army W.T.F! moments the following day, it has been liked 2,064 times, shared 3,600 times and received 1,079 comments.
