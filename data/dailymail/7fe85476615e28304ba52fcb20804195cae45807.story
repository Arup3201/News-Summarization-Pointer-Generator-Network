A small-town fire department has suspended half of its force this week after it was discovered that many members had been involved in a stunt which saw a trailer set on fire before a daredevil drove his car through the flames.

The Bennington Rural Fire Department is made up of around 40 volunteers but half were placed on administrative leave after they attended a local event called 'Mudder's Day'.

The annual celebration of mud-bogging is held each year in Bennington, Vermont and is memorable for its epic finale.

An old trailer home was covered in gas and set on fire before a volunteer drove a car through the blazing unit much to the delight of the crowds. Firefighters then rushed to put out the blaze.

Videos of the antics were posted online and caught the eye of the Department of Environmental Conservation who said that organizers did not have the correct permits.

The clip also caught the attention of the local fire department who called a meeting on Monday night and suspended staff who had doused the trailer in gas and set it alight.

Each volunteer is facing up to $100,000 fines and a maximum of five years in jail.

However people in the town of Bennington are concerned about the seriously depleted fire crew.

Local resident Shane Bishop told WCAX: 'I mean no one is going to show up. Are 
people going to burn or what?

'We had that fatality a few weeks ago here 
in town, so without them we are really going to be in trouble.'

Mud-bogging, also referred to as mud racing or mud drags, is a popular off-road activity where the objective is to drive a vehicle through a span of mud.
