A sixth form student has won a prestigious award for her scientific breakthrough which proved snails can see in colour.

Carly Brown, 18, picked up a £600 cheque after scooping the Zoological Society of London's Prince Philip Award and Marsh Prize.

Her study involved placing snails in 'choice chambers' into which coloured lights were shone and their movements were recorded.

Carly Brown's research disproved the assumption that snails' eyes are too primitive to see in colour

Just over 50 per cent moved towards red - suggesting snails do respond to colour.

Her research has challenged the traditional assumption that snails' eyes are too primitive to differentiate between colours.

Carly's 2,000-word study - titled 'Can the common garden snail see in colour?' - was praised by the judges as thoroughly researched and well argued.

Professor Geoff Boxshall, secretary of the Society, said: 'Carly presented a sound hypothesis, supported by appropriate biological arguments and background research.

'She provided an impressive critical evaluation of the project and was able to identify priorities for future research.'

Carly attends Taunton School in Somerset, which charges up to £30,000-per-year for boarders.

Headmaster Dr John Newton said: 'I congratulate Carly on gaining this prestigious accolade.

'Carly is a superbly industrious pupil who has won an academic prize that will add lustre to her CV and university application. I am immensely proud of her.'
