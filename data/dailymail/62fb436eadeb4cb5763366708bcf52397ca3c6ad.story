When Israel Smith's wife gave birth to their son four years ago, he had never heard of men having post-natal depression.

So as he started heading in a downward spiral in the months following Rilien's birth in October 2010, he never imagined it could be the cause of his fragile emotional state. 

Up until that point Mr Smith and his wife Belinda, from Coogee in Sydney, had successfully managed their photography business and raised their young daughter, Indrani.

But when Rilien was born things took a turn for Mr Smith.

'I was holding on by a fingernail,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Smith had not long run a marathon and was feeling extra pressure at work with his wife having stepped away from their business to take care of their two children in the lead up to Christmas.

'With Belinda leaving (the business), broken sleep and the new dynamic of the extra person I felt a self-imposed pressure to make it work and be the hero,' he said. 

'I didn't want to give my wife any indication of the stress, I wanted to give her the freedom to be a full-time mum.

'I was feeling really hopeless... I didn't know how to get out of this rut. I was feeling really lazy and lethargic. I was waking up angry or sad and I couldn't figure a way out of it.'

After two months Mr Smith's wife, who wasn't suffering with post-natal depression, said he had to see someone and the depression diagnosis quickly followed.

'One of things I noticed about myself was I thought I was being perfectly sane and rational, but I wasn't. The more I tried to insulate her from what was going on, the less present I was. 

'I didn't want to be grumpy and unhappy, but by withdrawing from them they weren't getting the father figure they needed. It put a lot of pressure on my wife, she really ended up holding the business and family together. 

'She was doing her best to love me while I was at my worst. There were some days she thought she couldn't keep going – to be the mum the kids needed… and be a supportive partner to the guy I married. It was pretty tough. It didn't feel like we were playing on the same team at that point.'

Israel underwent treatment for a year to treat his depression after his wife Belinda advised him to seek help

Mr Smith said his wife experienced a really painful childbirth and five weeks later accidentally chopped part of her finger off and required surgery.  

'We had this funny conversation... there was a disbelief I could be handling things that way when she lost part of her finger and a drug free childbirth. She's a whole lot of awesome... she had post-natal awesome,' he said.

'I just had no idea that post-natal depression related to men. I really thought it was solely the domain of women.'

But Mr Smith, who underwent treatment for a year to treat his depression, isn't the only male affected.

More than one in seven new mums and up to one in 20 new dads are diagnosed with post-natal depression each year in Australia, according to the Post and Antenatal Depression Association (PANDA).

Sophie Ryan, from Launceston in Tasmania, battled post-natal depression for four years following the birth of her daughter Audrey.

At the age of 33, Ms Ryan was adamant she had her life in order but things were turned upside down after the birth. 

'I was always a very organised person. But when a baby comes along there's no schedule any more, there's no keeping to time frames,' she said. 

'I had all the same things as new mothers like sleep deprivation and I had an awful lot of trouble breast feeding - I believe that had a huge impact on leading me to post-natal depression territory. 

'In my mind I was thinking; I'm an educated person, there's no way I can't handle this. I didn't want people to think I was failing or a bad mother.

'I felt like I was a huge burden on everyone. I felt ungrateful because I had a beautiful baby girl – she wasn't difficult, she was wonderful. I felt like I was a burden on my husband and family because I wasn't enjoying life.' 

Sophie said she was sleep deprived like every new mum, but also had trouble breast feeding Audrey

Sophie said during the standardised testing to see if expecting or new mums are on the post-natal spectrum she lied to make it seem like she was okay

Ms Ryan said during the standardised testing to see if expecting or new mums are on the post-natal spectrum she lied to make it seem like she was okay.

'Looking back it was really foolish. I probably should have put my hand up and said I needed help,' she said. 

'I can still remember the day I made the appointment to get help. My husband had to go back to work a fortnight after Audrey was born. I was feeling isolated at home and it gradually worsened. 

'I was teary, anxious and exhausted, which is typical of a new mother, but it just never got easier and continued to worsen. 

'I woke my husband and told him he couldn't go to work and that I wasn't coping.'

Sophie was appointed a counsellor and was put on anti-depressants. She is now helping other women with post-natal depression via her website Shout It Out Loud

'I want to get across that people aren't alone. There are so many new mothers out there going through the same thing. We talk about cancer and diabetes… we should approach this in the same way,' she said.  

Postnatal Depression Awareness Week runs from November 16-22.
