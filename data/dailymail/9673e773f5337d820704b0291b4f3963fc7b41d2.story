Ben Bernanke used to run America's central bank. Now he's making bank - charging financial gurus across the world millions to share his insight and experience.

Bernanke used to make $200,000 a year during his eight years as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He can make that in a single hour now on the international speaking circuit.

He left office in February. By March, he was making up to three stops a week around the world.

Bernanke is walking a well-worn path of former policy makers who leave power. Former presidents, former cabinet officials and former members of Congress have all turned their experience in public service into millions.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has hit the speaking circuit since leaving office in February - raking in millions in just a few months

Bankers from New York to Houston, Texas, 
to Singapore and Johannesburg, South Africa, are lining to pay Bernanke 
hundreds of thousand of dollars for private appearances.

But not everyone thinks his time is so valuable. The New York Times reports that Goldman Sachs and UBS both decided his fees were too high for what he was offering.

Indeed, guests at his private lectures have said most of his economic insight is simply a repeat what he said for eight years while he was in office.

'You can spend $250,000 for Bernankeâ€™s time at a private dinner, or you could just sit down and read what people like (new Fed Chairwoman) Janet Yellen and (Bank of England governor) Mark Carney have to say,' David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff, told the New York Times.

'You can actually do that for free and pretty much draw the same conclusions.'

Most bankers, though are willing to pay Bernanke's fee - and trade on the insight he gives.

Michael E. Novogratz, a principal of Fortress Investment Group told the Times that Bernanke has reinforced the idea that the economy and inflation are going to grow much more slowly than previously thought.

Investors responded by buying up fixed-income investments. Bernanke's post-Fed speeches, Mr Novogratz says, are responsible for part of the recent surge in demand for government bonds.

'I think that the markets and investors will put more credence on what Bernanke says,' Mr Rosenberg told the Times. 'There is a pervasive belief that Bernanke and Yellen are joined at the hip.'
