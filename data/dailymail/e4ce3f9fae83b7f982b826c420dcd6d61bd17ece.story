When it comes to remembering important dates, one family in New Mexico are especially organized.

Joanne Luna gave birth to her daughter, Lorraine Lindbloom, in 1985 - exactly nine months after getting married.

The date - July 2 - happened to be her date of birth, which seemed like a strange coincidence at the time.

However it was on Lorraine's 29th birthday this year that things really fell into place.

Cause for celebration: Gianna Ryan Lindbloom was born on Tuesday, July 2 , exactly 29 years after her mom, Lorraine (right), and 52 years after her grandmother, Joanne (left), was born

Lorraine Lindbloom started having contractions about 3am on her 29th birthday on July 2, but didn't realize the significance of what was happening until she was en route to the hospital

Lorraine started having contractions around 3am.

Then, as her and her husband set off on the hour-long commute to the hospital in Albuquerque, reality set in.

'It hit me on the drive,' Lindbloom told ABC News.

'I was like, ''Oh my gosh - she's going to have our birthdays''.

'I was crying and it was really emotional.'

Baby Gianna was born at 10.37am on July 2.

Proud grandmother Joanne no longer believes their circumstance can be put down to coincidence.

'I think it's something cosmic,' she told ABC News.

'I believe there is a reason for everything, I just don't know what it is.

'We started thinking that maybe it was my mother communicating to us.

Baby Gianna was born at 10.37am on July 2 - just her mom and grandmother - weighing in at 7 pounds and 3 ounces

'I was very distraught when she died.'

Stanford University professor estimated the chances of a mother, daughter and granddaughter sharing a birthday at 1 in 130,000.

'That's a lot more likely than winning a large lottery jackpot which is typically of the order of 1 in 100,000,000, so you can expect to find it in any moderately sized city,' Keith told ABC News.
