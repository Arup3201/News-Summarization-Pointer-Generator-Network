The World Cup has reached the quarter-final stage and what a thrilling tournament it's been. The 56 matches so far have produced 154 goals, with the record of 171 set in 1998 under threat.

We have seen the end of an era as defending champions Spain crashed out, some disappointing showings from the Europeans, some breath-takingly bold football from the South Americans and a few surprise packages.

Here, ahead of the quarter-finals, we crunch all the numbers to offer your ultimate stats breakdown of the World Cup so far.

TOTAL PASSES AND PASSES COMPLETED

Move over Spain, Germany are the new kings of tiki-taka. They have attempted and completed far more passes than anyone else at the World Cup, with Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos the metronome that keeps them moving forward.

In total, Germany have tried 2,695 passes in their four matches to date and 2,378 of those have reached their intended target.

This impressive tally puts their 
rivals in the shade, with Argentina the next highest but a long way 
behind on 2,219 attempted balls and 1,937 completed.

Spain did clock up 1,574 passes in their three matches but the old sparkle was missing and they bombed out in the group stages.

The
 much-admired Kroos, who has been linked with a succession of big 
European clubs this year, successfully completed 360 of his 394 
attempted passes - an accuracy ratio of 91 per cent.

He is joined in the top five by team-mates Philipp Lahm and Per Mertesacker, cogs in the well-oiled German passing machine.

Metronome: Argentina's Javier Mascherano also figured highly in the passing charts with 377 played in all

Driving force: Philipp Lahm carries the ball forward for Germany in their last-16 tie with Algeria

SHOTS-TO-GOALS CONVERSION

Colombia have been the revelation of the tournament so far and quarter-final opponents Brazil will have to be well-drilled given their deadly accuracy in front of goal.

Jose Pekerman's team score with three out of every 10 shots and their rising star James Rodriguez has a conversion ratio of 62.5 per cent.

With five goals to date, including that wonderful volley against Uruguay, he is leading the race for the Golden Boot ahead of pre-tournament favourites Neymar, Lionel Messi and Thomas Muller.

Interestingly, Neymar and Muller have precisely the same record - with a conversion rate of 36.4 per cent.

SHOOTING ACCURACY

Holland are the most adept at working the goalkeeper, with 62.7 per cent of their efforts hitting the target. Louis van Gaal's team have been free-flowing throughout the tournament, notably when they put five goals past defending champions Spain in their opening match.

Arjen Robben, who scored twice that night, hit the target with 88.9 per cent of his shots, the second highest of all the players. It won't surprise you that James Rodriguez, Neymar, Mario Gotze and Oscar also feature in this particular top 10, but Giovani dos Santos of Mexico is the only one who found the target with every one of his chances.

SHOTS ON TARGET

Belgium's 'Golden Generation' were always fancied to perform well at this tournament and they have proved their class by reaching the last eight.

They've also fired in the most shots on target, with 32 in their four matches so far. However, only six of these have actually gone in. Compare that with France, whose 31 shots on target have yielded 10 goals. Their striker Karim Benzema has been responsible for 13 of these efforts.

SHOTS OFF TARGET

Argentina haven't been at their peak in this tournament so far and they've been guilty of squandering a lot of chances.

They have racked up 34 shots off target, showing that although Lionel Messi, Javier Mascherano and company can create openings at will, they're not too successful at converting them. In the players' chart, Asamoah Gyan of Ghana had the most wayward shots with 10.

HIT WOODWORK

France have one of the sharpest attacks, sticking five past Switzerland and three past Honduras, but that haul would have been even greater had they not hit the woodwork six times. Antoine Griezmann and Yohan Cabaye were denied by the post or bar twice each.

ASSISTS

As mentioned earlier, Colombia have been very impressive during this tournament and while James Rodriguez takes most of the plaudits, they should also be warmly thanking Juan Guillermo Cuadrado. He has contributed four assists so far.

Holland's Daley Blind has set up three during their run to a quarter-final with Costa Rica.

CHANCES CREATED

He was under enormous pressure to perform at this World Cup and Lionel Messi certainly hasn't let anyone down. As well as his four goals, he has created 18 chances with those twinkling toes.

A spare part at Bayern, Xherdan Shaqiri of Switzerland has put himself in the shop window with a number of fine displays and he set up 17 chances.

CROSSES

He scored the winning goal on Tuesday as Argentina beat Switzerland and the stats show that Angel Di Maria is also the crossing king of the World Cup so far.

The Real Madrid star has swung in 33 deliveries in four matches, while Argentina have produced 97 crosses overall. Another Argentine, Marcos Rojo, has put in 23 balls, while Di Maria has also taken 17 corners.

DRIBBLES

No prizes for guessing who tops the leaderboard in this category. Lionel Messi is certainly not afraid to carry the Argentina attack, as shown by 41 dribbles in the tournament to date.

His most telling was the dazzling run that teed up Di Maria for the decisive goal against the Swiss.

Another man with the weight of the world on his shoulders, Brazil's Neymar, has cut loose 36 times, while Chile's ever-impressive Alexis Sanchez went on a run on 35 occasions.

TACKLES

We're more used to seeing him score spectacular goals for Chelsea, but Oscar isn't afraid to get stuck in either.

The Brazil star has made 21 tackles in the competition so far, putting him on a par with Argentina's Javier Mascherano.

The insatiable desire of Brazil and Argentina to have possession means they are first and second in the overall team chart with 94 and 93 respectively.

CLEARANCES

Gary Medel, nursing a thigh injury, was heroic in Chile's loss to Brazil and, given the brave rearguard action they mounted, it's not a surprise to find him top of the clearances table with 40.

That was one ahead of America's Matt Besler (39). The USA cleared the ball 165 times in all during their four matches, far more than anyone else.

SAVES MADE

There have been some glorious goalkeeping performances at this World Cup and Tim Howard has been particularly impressive. The American stopper made a total of 27 saves in their four games.

Nigeria's Vincent Enyeama (22), Algeria's Rais M'Bolhi (20) and Switzerland's Diego Benaglio (20) have also caught the eye with their shot-stopping.

FOULS CONCEDED

It's a dubious distinction to be the dirtiest player at a World Cup and the honour goes to Iran's Reza Ghoochannejhad, who conceded 16 fouls over the course of their three matches.

Of the teams still in the tournament, Belgium's Marouane Fellaini is the most reckless with 14 fouls. Teams wise, Costa Rica have heard the referee's whistle blow for a foul on 81 occasions.
