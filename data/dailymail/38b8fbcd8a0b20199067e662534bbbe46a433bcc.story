Swansea are discussing a potential Â£4million deal for Bosnia-Herzegovina midfielder Muhamed Besic, of Ferencvaros.

The Swans may face competition from other clubs in Europe though, with Sevilla credited with an interest in the talented youngster.

Besic, who represented the chance to represent Germany at youth level in order to play for Bosnia-Herzegovina U21s in 2010, can also play at centre-back.

The 21-year-old played in all three of Bosnia-Herzegovina's World Cup games, as Safet Susic's side bowed out after the group stages.

Born in Berlin, Besic began his career with Hamburg, though disciplinary problems limited his opportunities at the Bundesliga club.

In 2012 he moved to Ferencvaros and in his first season at the club helped them finish fifth in the Hungarian top division.
