An ironic venue choice has been made by the Liberal National Party's for the International Women's Day event.

The annual luncheon event is set to be held at the exclusive men's-only club - the Tattersall's Club in Brisbane on Friday.

The oldest and most prestigious membership club in Brisbane boasts that those who wish to sign up will enjoy unlimited possibilities, luxury services and the opportunity to join 'an influential network of like-minded members'.

But if you aren't a man, you need to be a relative or friend of a member to be privileged enough to walk through the door and relish in these perks.

The exclusive men's-only club - the Tattersall's Club in Brisbane is the ironic venue of choice for the International Women's Day event hosted by the Liberal National Party on Friday

An LNP spokesman said the venue was chosen due to availability, price and flexibility and location.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten asked Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is also the Federal Minister for Women, to comment on the topic during Question Time at Parliament House on Wednesday.

Mr Abbott replied that the venue choice should be deemed as a positive move - saying the last sexism barrier had been broken down.

'Admit women! Isn't that fantastic? At last, this bastion of chauvinism has admitted women and they've done it on International Women's Day because of the Liberal National Party, Fairfax reported him as saying.

'Good on the Liberal National Party, smashing the glass ceiling yet again.'

'I say congratulations and thank God that bastion of old-fashioned chauvinism has finally collapsed like the walls of Jericho at the trumpet cry of the Liberal National Party,' he said

Parliamentary Speaker Fiona Simpson, who is the keynote speaker at the luncheon, did not seem bothered by the event being held at a club where women aren't allowed to join.

'I'm less troubled by openly 'male only' clubs or openly 'women only' gyms than I am by areas of society that have a veneer of equality but which hide structural impediments or unconscious bias that block women from opportunities,' she said told the Brisbane Times.
