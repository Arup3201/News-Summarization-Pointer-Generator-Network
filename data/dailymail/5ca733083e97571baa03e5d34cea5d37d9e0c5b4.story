Teacher Bernadette Yuson (pictured) has been sent on administrative leave while the school investigates the incident

A high school teacher has been put on leave following outrage over a student's claim she reseated all the black pupils in her classroom and said she wanted to 'move all the n******s'.

Bernadette Yuson, of Cajon High School in San Bernadino, used the racial slur in front of her class on September 3.

The comment caused outrage among the community and local advocacy groups who have called for her to be banned from the classroom.

The San Bernadino Sun reported student LaRue Bell was in her class on September 3 when she began rearranging the students' seating.

The student said he then asked her: 'How come you're moving all the black people around?'

She responded: 'Because I want to move all the n*****s.'

At a recent town hall meeting, community leaders and the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) called for her to be banned.

Vice president of the San Bernadino NAACP branch A. Marjadi told the meeting: 'If you can refer to our kids as being n*****s, then you don't need to teach them.'

The school has placed her on paid leave while they investigate the incident.

CBS Los Angeles reported that the San Bernadino school district's spokesperson confirmed the slur was used by Ms Yuson.

The statement said: 'We can assure the public that the district took the student’s complaint seriously, and at no time did any district employee minimize the gravity of the impact of the teacher’s words.'

The incident occurred at Cajon High School (pictured), in San Bernadino, during a maths class on September 3

Ms Yuson recently responded to the allegation to put her side of the story across.

In her statement, which was uploaded to Scribd, she claimed the student was being disruptive and she heard him yell the word n***** at his classmate. She then responded by stating the word, asking him: 'Wow. N*****? Is that a good word?'

While she admitted there was a change of the seating plan she said it was not to move only black students but intended to lessen the whole class from talking to one another.
