Eye on the prize: This greyhound's steely gaze is fixed firmly on the hare which is giving him a right old run around

This hare gave these greyhounds a right old run around at a coursing event in Ireland.

The muzzled dogs were more than happy to give chase, but as these pictures show, the quick-wits and lightning reflexes of the hare appeared to keep him away from danger.

The dogs have a determined look in their eyes as they chase the hare down, but he appears to be just too speedy for them.

In one picture the dog's steely gaze is fixed firmly on the hare, who is trying his best to stay at least one step ahead of the pursuing canine.

Elsewhere the dogs appear to have caught up with the hare, but he still seems to escape their clutches unscathed.

The action came from the first day of the JP McManus Irish Cup coursing event at County Limerick Coursing Club on Friday.

The annual meeting sees greyhounds course hares, with an 80,000 Euro first prize at stake, on Limerick Racecourse, at Greenmount, Patrickswell.

Hare coursing has been illegal throughout the UK since 2005, but continues in other countries as a regulated and judged competitive sport, particularly in Ireland and Spain.

Coursing is a long-established technique for hunting which grew in Europe during the 19th century.

It has experienced a decline in more recent years, in part due to the rise of greyhound racing and betting.

Controversy has developed around the sport in recent decades, with some opposers viewing it as a cruel bloodsport.
