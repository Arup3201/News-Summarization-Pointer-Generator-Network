A spectacular new cable car that rotates to give visitors a panoramic views, has been unveiled at a Swiss mountain resport.

The Titlis Rotair gondola rotates its way up towards the snow-covered summit of Mount Titlis from the popular resort town of Engelberg in the Canton of Obwalden in central Switzerland.

The vehicle transports tourists from the middle station at Stand up to the top of the 9,926ft high mountain.

The gondola revolves 360 degrees during the five-minute trip, treating visitors to idyllic panoramic views of steep rock faces, deep crevasses and distant snow-covered mountain peaks.

It’s one of only three rotating cable cars in the world, the other two being the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway in California and The Table Mountain Cableway in Cape Town, South Africa.

The idea for the rotating cable cars for winter and summer tourists at Engelberg was first floated as long ago as 1992, but was initially rejected by the department for transport as being too fanciful.

But now, more than 22-years-later, it has finally been made into reality with the first cars heading up the slopes this week.

It allows people to experience different views as the cabin slowly rotates as it travels up the mountain.

Tourist Martin Meyer, 45, said: ‘I always seem to get stuck in the pit of the cabin with worst view, but with the cabin slowly rotating sometimes you are looking down into the valley, and sometimes up to the mountain ahead.

‘And with the great panorama windows there is always something to look at wherever you are standing.

A cable car now running in the Dachstein mountain region in Styria, Austria has an open air viewing platform.Ten people can fit on the viewing platform where they can enjoy views that include several glaciers and more than a dozen peaks over 8,000ft

‘It makes the journey to the top of the 3000 metre peak much more pleasant and interesting.’

‘The pilot project involved installing temporary much smaller cabins where only the floor in the middle rotated, but was such a success that the new extra large circular cabins with wide panorama view windows have now taken their place.

This time the whole cabin rotates once through 360 degrees as it goes up the mountain, turning on the axle where it is connected to the cable.

The new project is just the latest in a number of innovative attempts to make cable cars more interesting as competition for visitors increases among Alpine regions.
