Two Colorado police officers facing felony charges for shooting a massive elk known as 'Big Boy' by locals have resigned amid an ongoing internal investigation into its death.

Sam Carter and Brent Curnow handed in their letters of resignation to the Boulder Police Department on Tuesday following the January 1 shooting which momentarily placed them both under arrest on Friday.

'The Boulder Police Department does not tolerate this kind of behavior,' Police Chief Mark Becknersaid in a statement obtained by ABC. 'Police officers and other members of this department will be held accountable for their actions and behavior, and we want the community to know how seriously we take this breach of trust.'

According to an arrest affidavit, 
Carter told police the day after the shooting that he encountered an elk
on January 1 that he said was injured and needed to be put down.

Carter
then blasted the animal with a shotgun, and Curnow, who was off-duty at
the time, came to pick up the carcass with the help of an on-duty 
Boulder County sheriff's deputy, identified as Jeff George, the 
affidavit states.

Carter did not report the incident or
notify his supervisors that he had fired his weapon that night, though 
he told investigators that he called in the incident and said he did not
know why dispatch had no record of it, according to the affidavit.

However, cell phone records obtained from phone carriers for Carter, Curnow and George show the shooting was premeditated.

Both men face felony counts of tampering
with physical evidence, attempt to influence a public servant and 
forgery, as well as misdemeanor charges of unlawful taking of a trophy 
elk, a Samson law surcharge, killing an elk out of season, use of an 
electronic device to take an elk, and official misconduct, said District
Attorney Stan Garnett.

Carter and Curnow could face prison time and the loss of their official police certifications. An internal investigation will continue past their resignation, according to police.

The officers, who had been on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation by the Boulder Police Department, were released on $20,000 apiece, the Denver Post reported.

Carter texted Curnow at 2:56am, about ten hours before the shooting, on New Year's Day saying, ‘found wapiti (elk) you up?’ That was followed by a text at 4:14am saying, ‘Should I go hunting?’ Carter also texted George that night.

At 2:45pm, Curnow texted ‘You should have killed it’ to Carter.

Carter responded, ‘Oh he's dead tonight. His right side is broke off at main beam. And he looks a little smaller. He may not be wapiti, but he's gonna die.’

On thin ice: The two officers are facing multiple felony counts and misdemeanor charges, said District Attorney Stan Garnett

When Curnow texted ‘Get him’ to Carter after 10pm, Carter replied, ‘Too many people right now.’Two minutes before midnight, Carter texted ‘Elk down’ to Curnow.

All of the texts and phone calls from that night had been erased from Carter and Curnow's phones when they were seized for evidence.

Carter allegedly had also applied for a road kill permit with the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department, saying the elk had broken an antler off.

Investigators believe Curnow had sawed the antler off.

Spirit: Many admired the elk for its grace

According to the Colorado Peace 
Officer Standards and Training Board, a Colorado police officer could 
lose his certification for any felony conviction or one of 43 
misdemeanors, including first-degree official misconduct.

The neighboring Colorado community was shaken by the 
loss of their beloved elk and held a walk to honor the creature while 
accusing the local police department of cruelly misusing their 
authority.

Several dozen 
residents of Boulder marched in a silent protest earlier this month, some blaring
elk calls on their outstretched cell phones.

'We're concerned about the larger 
culture of misconduct that needs to be addressed in order for taxpaying 
voters to regain trust in the department,' a resident involved in the 
walk told CBS Denver.

The walk was just one in a series of events for the late Big Boy. The week prior, the community held a candlelight vigil in his honor.

The massive creature was described as their 'guardian' by some.

Curnow had been with the department for 14 years, according to the Boulder Daily Camera.

The Daily Camera revealed that the suspended officer owns a taxidermy website, which advertises 'quality taxidermy at an affordable price,' according to the paper.

It is believed that Curnow and Carter were going to cut up the animal for its meat.

There were mixed reports from Boulder residents that the bull elk had been behaving aggressively before it was shot.
