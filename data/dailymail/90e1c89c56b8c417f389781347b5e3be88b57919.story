Nicky Henderson’s Champion Hurdle runner-up My Tent Or Yours has been ruled out for the season after suffering a tendon injury.

The talented gelding had been 7-1 fourth favourite for the hurdling crown at Cheltenham in March, a race in which he was beaten a neck by Jezki last year under champion jockey AP McCoy.

Henderson had been intending to return the gelding, who runs in the colours of owner JP McManus, in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle at the end of next month.

Henderson said: 'Unfortunately he’s had an injury and I’m not going to get him back for Cheltenham (in March), so that’s it for the season.

'We were planning to stay over hurdles with him and we were looking at the Fighting Fifth, but that isn’t going to happen now.

'He’s not lame, he’s not sore, he’s not anything really, but there is an issue there unfortunately, which is very frustrating.'

Coral now make Willie Mullins-trained Faugheen, winner of the Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle at last season’s Cheltenham Festival the 4-1 joint favourite for the Champion alongside Nigel Twiston-Davies trained The New One, an unlucky third in the 2014 race after being hampered.

The New One will make his seasonal reappearance at Kempton on Sunday when he lines up in the Listed williamhill.com Hurdle.
