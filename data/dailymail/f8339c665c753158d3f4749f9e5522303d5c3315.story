A ringing endorsement from Sami Hyypia is one you cherish. That’s exactly what Joao Teixeira has enjoyed after the Liverpool youngster’s loan spell at Brighton has begun with the sort of promise that will have those around Melwood with more than a little interest.

Hyypia spoke of Albion having a ‘very good player’ on their hands and the need to ‘get the ball to him in dangerous areas’. Clearly the Championship side see the Portuguese as their catalyst – even after just three games together.

Hardly surprising really, Teixeira has two goals in his first three – including the winner against Bolton Wanderers on Saturday.

Making waves: Liverpool's Joao Teixeira is impressing while on loan at Brighton in the Championship 

Finding the net: The Portuguese scored against Bolton this weekend and Leeds the Saturday before (above)

Guile: The youngster has serious poise in possession and able to pick holes in back fours at will

Liverpool may just have another gem on their hands here. Teixeira already beginning to make waves down on the south coast.

Hailed by Brendan Rodgers as 'the outstanding performer in our reserves' in the New Year, Teixeira handed a Premier League in the dramatic 3-2 win over Fulham.

Liverpool bought him for £800,000 after he had starred for Sporting Lisbon during their 3-0 victory at Anfield in the 2011 NextGen Series.

Teixeira is a player with the sort of poise and guile in possession Rodgers yearns for – an attacking midfielder with the ability to pick holes in defences, find the net and lay on for others.

What he does need is regular game time in order to hone his skills; Hyypia spotted this, got on the phone to former team-mate Steven Gerrard and the player agreed to head south for the season. it was slightly surprising that he'd make the jump to the Championship, given he was unable to break into Brentford's League One promotion team last season. But he's grabbed the opportunity already. 

It's good to talk! Brighton boss Sami Hyypia spoke to Steven Gerrard before sanctioning the loan move 

Liverpool have invested a significant amount of time and money into nurturing Teixeira. The signs are that he could become someone with a huge amount to offer in the coming years.

The Reds have always known this. Former academy director Frank McParland sanctioned the original spend from Sporting Lisbon in 2012.

'We knew when we saw him he was one for us and when we got the chance to sign him the manager backed me and we spent a considerable sum for him,' McParland told Sportsmail at the time.

‘He is going to be a top, top player.' 

Think Philippe Coutinho. Supporters wouldn’t mind another one of him.
