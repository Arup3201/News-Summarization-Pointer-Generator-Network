Jack - or Julie as he is known when dressed in feminine attire - loves nothing more than to go out, meet a man or woman and indulge in wild sex.

The 75-year-old is representative of an increasingly
virile older generation who, despite their advancing 
years, enjoys a regular and rather unconventional sex life.

'Sex is a 
major part of my life,’ he says. ‘I enjoy it, it’s fun and so does my 
regular girlfriend. We both like having sex with other people, with 
ourselves as much a possible. I have sex with guys at clubs, usually in fairly dark 
surroundings. 

'I'’ll do anything that’s not judged as high risk although low risk doesn’t mean no risk.’

Jack is just one of the many colourful characters that viewers meet when watching The Sex Clinic, Channel 4's new mini-series documenting the varied clientele such a service attracts.

The number of people visiting sex clinics in the UK for medical help or advice has doubled in the past five years.

Indeed Britain is in the midst of an 
epidemic, with over nine million Britons suffering with some form of 
sexually transmitted disease (STD), and the rates of infection are 
rising every day.

And nowhere is more aware - or 
stretched by - this than the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital and 
University Hospitals Birmingham, who manage the UK's two largest sexual 
health clinics.

In episode two we meet adults of all ages and backgrounds who are concerned about their likelihood of suffering with an STD.

There is responsible 28-year-old Camille, who simply wants to make sure she is safe to 'take her relationship to the next level'.

Jack - or Julie when dressed as his female alter ego - is concerned he might have caught and STD after a brief encounter

And course there is Jack who has visited the Dean Street Clinic in Soho, part of the Chelsea and 
Westminster Trust, because he has been suffering with bleeding in a 
delicate area.

Having gone into remission from prostate cancer, a common disease amongst his age group, Jack is unsure as to whether he has caught an STD or his cancer has returned.

He slept with a person the previous week but had no idea who he or she was.

Asked if he has suffered with an STD before, he responds that he has, having previously suffered with chlamydia, warts and herpes.

Jack claims that when he is not dressed as Julie he is not attracted to men. Although his dedication to his alter-ego has also led him to have hormone therapy to grow a small pair of breasts.

He also admits that his choice of skirt has shortened as he's grown older.

The doctor recommends he gets tested for various STDs and he must wait a week before he gets his results.

Chlamydia is the most commonly diagnosed STD in Britain, closely followed by gonorrhoea, the HPV virus and syphilis. 

A 2010 report from the Health 
Protection Agency found a rise in the number of people in their 50s, 
60s, 70s and 80s having sex with new partners since 2000.

The study also found that there had 
been an increase in all of the five main STDs in older age groups, with 
the age group 45 to 64 witnessing the biggest rise in syphilis, herpes, 
chlamydia and genital warts between 2000 and 2009.

Further north at the Wittal Clinic in Birmingham is David, 19,  one of many teenagers who seem entirely ignorant about sexual health.

During his consultation he seems less concerned by his regular sex without a condom than the fact he slept with a woman who didn't wash before having sex with him.

The 
nurse has to explain to him that washing plays no role in preventing 
being infected with an STD.

It is also recommended he had the vaccine for Hepatitis B because he cannot keep track of the amount of people he sleeps with and he rarely uses a condom.

When asked when he does use one, he responds: 'It depends on whether I'm drunk or can be arsed.'

Harry is concerned he has caught the HIV virus after engaging in a drug-fuelled 24-hour sex binge

Feeling faint: The reality of Harry's situation hits him during a visit to the Sex Clinic

Back in London, 22-year-old Harry is concerned he may have contracted HIV after enjoying a 24-hour drug-fuelled sex session.

He is given an PEP test which can instantly tell a doctor whether a patient was HIV positive up to six weeks previously.

Harry tests negative so is given an intensive course of antiviral drugs, although he will have to wait another month before he know for sure if he contracted it over the weekend.

It is thought that one in seven gay men living in London suffer with HIV.

However, Harry suffers hideous side-effects from the drugs and stops taking them after just one week. For him, the discomfort was too much to bear and he is faced with an agonising wait for his final results.

The third and final episode of The Sex Clinic airs next Thursday on Channel 4 at 10pm
