Going through security at the airport can often be an aggravating experience at the best of times.

But when you look at what was seized from passengers in the U.S. last year at security checkpoints, then you might feel slightly happier to take off your shoes and walk through the x-ray machine.

The Transport Security Administration has released photos of its ten best finds of 2011, featuring a loaded .380 pistol strapped to a 76-year-old’s ankle and two knives hidden in a hollowed-out book.

Discovery: Agents found two throwing knives inside a hollowed out book opened at a page headed 'Chapter Two - Ninja Equipment' at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in D.C. (DCA)

Oops: One student managed to shut down a whole checkpoint at Omaha, Nebraska (OMA), when his innocent science project was flagged up as appearing to resemble an improvised explosive device

Shooting practice? A flare gun kit with seven flares was discovered inside a passenger's hand-luggage in Norfolk, Virginia (ORF)

Amazing finds: A stun gun was disguised as a pink mobile phone at Los Angeles, California (LAX), left, and this loaded .380 pistol, right, was strapped to a 76-year-old man's ankle in Detroit, Michigan (DTW)

One of the most impressive items among the many found by security agents was a stun gun disguised as a pink mobile phone at Los Angeles, California (LAX), according to the TSA Blog.

Agents also found two throwing knives inside a hollowed out book opened at a page headed ‘Chapter Two - Ninja Equipment’ at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in D.C. (DCA).

Meanwhile a flare gun kit with seven flares was discovered inside a passenger’s hand-luggage in Norfolk, Virginia (ORF) and inert landmines were found in Salt Lake City, Utah (SLC).

The loaded .380 pistol strapped to the elderly man’s ankle was found in Detroit, Michigan (DTW) and he allegedly claimed to have forgotten it was there, reported the TSA Blog.

A nasty-looking martial arts weapon known as a ‘tactical spike’ was found in a passenger’s sock in Pensacola, Florida (PNS), which was spotted as the person went through a body scanner.

Detection: Small chunks of C4 explosives were found in luggage in one man's luggage in Yuma, Arizona, who was apparently 'bringing it home to show his family'. An Explosive Trace Detection machine is pictured

Uncovered: More than 1,200 firearms were found by the TSA at U.S. checkpoints last year (file picture)

One student managed to shut down a whole checkpoint at Omaha, Nebraska (OMA), when his innocent science project was flagged up as appearing to resemble an improvised explosive device.

Small chunks of C4 explosives were found in checked luggage in one man’s luggage in Yuma, Arizona, who was apparently ‘bringing it home to show his family’, reported the TSA Blog.

Seven small snakes were found in Miami, Florida (MIA) in a man’s trousers. He also had three small turtles in female hosiery. U.S. Fish and Wildlife officers took care of the reptiles at the scene.

Then in Los Angeles, California (LAX) two birds were found during a pat-down of a woman travelling to China. She was arrested on suspicion of smuggling and exporting an endangered species.

More than 1,200 firearms were found by the TSA at security checkpoints across the U.S. last year, with many passengers claiming they had just forgotten a gun had been left in their bag.
