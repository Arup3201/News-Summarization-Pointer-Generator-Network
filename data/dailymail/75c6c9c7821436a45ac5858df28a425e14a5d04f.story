Olympic shooting star Peter Wilson may be forced to quit the sport after his practice range was accused of polluting a multi-millionaire neighbour’s land with pellets.

Equities trader Alastair Cooper claims that lead pellets from Southern Counties Shooting (SCS) - where Wilson trains - are raining down onto his  £6million Dorset estate, killing livestock and polluting the land.

The owner of SCS fears a legal row over the issue could force the business to close as early as January with the loss of 40 jobs.

If that happens Mr Wilson, 26, will have to make a six-hour round trip to London to practice - forcing him to hang up his shotgun.

He said: 'I had heard that closure was a possibility but I never thought it would come to this, never in a million years. The impact would be dreadful.

'I don’t have enough money to move, so living at home is my only option right now.

'I would have to quit the sport, I would have to call it a day - it is as drastic as that.

'How many other Peter Wilsons are out there that would be affected by this?'

The shooting range at Evershot has more than 450 fully-automatic traps and was an official training range for London 2012.

It has been the long-term training base of Mr Wilson - winner of the Double Trap event at London 2012 - who lives just a few miles away at Glanvilles Wootton near Sherborne.

Mr Cooper, a former head of European equity derivatives at Morgan Stanley, bought the neighbouring 3,000 acre estate at Sydling St Nicholas for £6million in 2001.

He set about restoring the heavily-farmed land into an organic paradise where he now rears and sells traditional breeds of sheep, pig and cattle under the Sydling Brook Organic label.

Mr Cooper said he does not want the shooting range to close and is simply trying to protect his land.

He said: 'We are not trying to close the shooting ground at all. How the shooting ground operates is nothing to do with me.

'All I have been trying to stop, as has the Environment Agency and Environmental Health, is levels of toxic lead falling on my agricultural farmland.

'Unfortunately the lead levels have become so high on the land neighbouring the shooting ground that my crops have been destroyed, my lambs have been slaughtered and the land has been declassified as organic.

'It is not fit for agricultural consumption, there is a fear about lead contamination into the watercourse and because of that the various agencies have said that further lead deposits have to stop because of those fears.

'We are seeking to stop further lead deposits and that is all it is.'

But Kevin Newton, manager of SCS, said he cannot afford to wage a legal battle against his wealthy neighbour and will have to close rather than see the case go to court.

He added: 'We have been here for 53 years and we have always dropped lead on to that land. Alastair knew that when he bought the farm ten years ago.

'For the first eight years, he used to come up here for shooting lessons. Then, two years ago, he started complaining - he says his lambs had to be slaughtered, but they were slaughtered for human consumption, not because they were contaminated.

'He’s got all the money in the world, and over 3,000 acres of land.

'Why he’s complaining about only 60 acres of land I’ll never know - he’s got plenty more land and we are offering to buy it from him for three times market rate. It’s ridiculous.'

He added that if the business closed, the nearest professional range would be in London.

Mr Newton said: 'Peter would have to travel to London and
that’s totally impractical. You can put ranges on your own land but 
it’s not the same as shooting at a professional range.'

The Environment Agency are aware of the situation but declined to comment.
