Dressed in matching skin-coloured caps, round spectacles and grey moustaches, these young children are taking part in a lookalike record attempt like no other.

The 485 children donned matching outfits in honour of Mahatma Gandhi, the iconic Indian spiritual leader who was assassinated 64 years ago to the day.

As well as the peace leader's trademark round glasses and moustache, the boys also sported white robes to mimic his traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, as well as holding walking sticks.

Fitting: The half a kilometre march the children completed mirrored Gandhi's Dandi peace march in 1930

Their march was an attempt to bring alive memories of Gandhi's historic Dandi march in March 1930 which sparked India's independence movement.

The boys, all aged between ten and 16 and mostly from single mothers, walked in costume for half a kilometre in central Kolkata, West Bengal.

The underprivileged youngsters also set a world record, as their march of 485 children was the largest such gathering ever recorded.

Their impressive effort eclipsed the previous record for such an event, where 255 children dressed as Gandhi in Tamil Nadu's Coimbatore district on June 13, 2010.

The children took part in the march named 'Rise Up' while watched by Gandhi's granddaughter Usha Gokani.

She said: 'It's a great feeling. When my children heard of the effort they egged me to come to Kolkata.

'They said it may be a bit tiring for you, but the trip is worth to be made.

'I now know they were right. I am moved by the passion for the father of the nation displayed by these children.'

Michael Anthony, who runs the UK-based organisers TRACKS (Training Recourse and Care for Kids) who set up the march, said: 'We don't want the underprivileged kids to forget the rich legacy of Gandhian ideology.'

Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on October 2 is commemorated as Gandhi Jayanti - a national holiday which sees tributes across the country.

'Mahatma' Gandhi, which means Great Soul, was born in 1869 and was an inspirational leader of India and the Indian independence movement.

He is famed for his non-violent means to achieve his goals, which resulted in the independence of the country.

Gandhi is one of the most influential figures in recent history and his methods inspired civil rights movements across the world.

Gandhi was fatally shot on January 30 1948 while having one of his nightly public walk on the grounds of the Birla Bhavan (Birla House) in New Delhi.

The assassin, Nathuram Godse, was a Hindu radical with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha.
