Amy Black, 40, was suffering from post-natal depression when she killed her baby Zoe

A mother suffering from post-natal depression thought her TV was 'telling her to do things' before she drowned her baby and dumped it in a factory car park, a court has heard.

Amy Black, 40, snapped after enduring a sleepless night with seven-month-old daughter Zoe, who had been crying constantly because of a painful case of glue ear.

CCTV footage showed Black climbing a makeshift ladder and tipping the child's body over an eight-foot fence into undergrowth that separated her 
bungalow in Bestwood, Nottingham, from an industrial unit.

She became increasingly paranoid at her home before the horrific incident, and believed her husband was a spy from the UK Government.

Black also thought her neighbours were ignoring her because she was American, and had illusions of her television telling her to leave the UK.

Several witnesses reported the child's body appeared to be ‘wet’ shortly after she was discovered, with ‘clear liquid’ coming from her mouth.

Half-an-hour later she called 999 - but paramedics were unable to revive Zoe.

At an earlier hearing Black pleaded guilty to infanticide on the grounds that she ‘caused the death of her child at a time the balance of her mind had not recovered fully from giving birth’.

She was sentenced by High Court Judge Mrs Justice Kathryn Thirlwall at the same court today.

Detaining her in a secure hospital for an indefinite period, Mrs Justice Thirlwall said: 'You are suffering from a mental illness that makes it necessary that you be detained for treatment.'

Black's mother and stepfather attended today's hearing along with her elderly husband, Jack, who the court heard was suffering from a terminal illness.

The court heard from three psychiatrists who agreed that Black was continuing to suffer from a mental illness which required further treatment.

Isabella Forshall QC, defending Black, said: 'She was seriously ill at the time of the incident and continues to need treatment.'

Timothy Spencer QC, prosecuting, had told the court there was evidence to show that in the months leading up to Zoe’s death, Black’s mind was ‘significantly disturbed’.

The court heard she and her husband, 70-year-old Zen trainer Jack Black, had lived in the UK for 30 months before the tragedy.

They met after Black read a book her 
future husband had written about Zen spiritualism and left her home in 
the US state of Minnesota to travel to India in the hope of finding 
‘spiritual fulfilment, Mr Black, or possibly both’.

Mr Black told detectives ‘his wife hid a lot from him, sometimes she didn’t want to share with him what she was feeling’.

She also developed a worsening dislike for their bungalow, claiming the television was telling her ‘to do specific things’ such as leave the UK.

Mr Spencer said she indicated she was having suicidal thoughts and went on to tell her husband, who suffered from chronic respiratory problems often leaving him confined to a wheelchair, that he was a UK government employee who had been placed in their home ‘to spy on her’.

The court heard that neighbours told police that Black appeared ‘overburdened and finding it difficult to cope with a sick husband and newborn baby’.

The day before she killed Zoe, Black took a taxi to London with her daughter and booked into a room at a Premier Inn in Ealing.

Police were alerted to the fact they were missing by paramedics who had been called to their home by Mr Black. His respiratory condition had worsened when he had awoken to find them gone.

Black was eventually returned home by police officers, telling them that, apart from exhaustion, she was ‘fine’ and had simply ‘had words’ with her husband.

The hearing was told events surrounding the her death were captured on a CCTV camera at the factory which bordered Black’s home.

Mr Spencer said the youngster was 
unwell with glue ear, a blockage of the middle ear, which meant that 
Black, whose husband was still in hospital, had a ‘disturbed night 
indeed with little sleep’.

The
 court was shown enhanced CCTV footage which showed the house lights on 
throughout the early hours, and Black tending to Zoe, who was lying in a
 cot near the patio doors.

Judge Mrs Justice Thirlwall told Nottingham Crown Court she was satisfied that at the time of Zoe's death she was suffering from a 'severe mental illness'

Mr
 Spencer added that a neighbour recalled hearing Zoe crying at 7am 
before a CCTV recording two hours later showed Zoe cradled in her 
mother’s arms.

Further 
footage taken at 9.39am showed Zoe held under her mother’s right arm, 
which, said Mr Spencer, ‘was in a way inconsistent with Zoe being 
alive’.

At 9.41am, Black was
 filmed scaling a makeshift ladder she had constructed from garden 
furniture to drop Zoe on the other side of the 8ft high wire mesh 
security and into the factory car park.

Minutes
 later, CCTV showed Black scaling the fence and standing at the point 
where she had dropped her child. She took with her a cordless phone and a
 knife, which she used to inflict non-serious wounds on her own arms and
 neck.

Neighbours, paramedics and the police who saw Zoe’s body all said it appeared to be ‘damp’ or ‘wet’. Mr Spencer said the evidence ‘points inescapably that the defendant drowned Zoe’.

 ... 'You are suffering from a mental illness that makes it necessary that you be detained for treatment.'

He added that Black told police who accompanied her to hospital: ‘Don’t bring Zoe back. She wanted to die. She’s been unwell because she’s been crying a lot.’

She went on to refuse to comment in police interviews, or tell doctors what had happened to her daughter - but did tell neighbours at the scene: ‘I don’t know what I have done. I am never going to be able to live this down. My head is spinning.’

Psychiatrist Mary di Lustro told the court that she and two fellow experts agreed that Black was suffering from a mental illness and personality disorder and concurred with the prosecution that she should be detained in a medium secure mental health unit under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act.

Doctor di Lustro said if Black responded well to drug treatment she could be eligible for conditional discharge within two or three years but Dr Di

Speaking afterwards, Detective Inspector Mat Healey, who led the investigation for Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'This is a tragic case where, I am sure, the outcome offers little relief for those involved.

'I would like to commend those neighbours and friends who discovered Zoe's lifeless body and began, in vain, the distressing task of trying to revive her.

'It too has been a difficult case for officers to investigate and I would like to thank them for their professionalism and sensitivity which has been evident throughout.'

Feeling 'low' after having a baby,
 also known as the 'baby blues', is so common it is considered normal, 
but 10-15 per cent of mothers go on to develop a much deeper and 
long-term condition called post-natal depression (PND).

It
 usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on 
gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite
 severe.

Sufferers 
may feel sad or low, unable to cope, and hostile or indifferent to their
 husband, partner or baby.  They may have thoughts about death, be 
unable to sleep, and feel hopeless about the future.

Many
 of those who suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say
 that if PND is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and
 to be less severe.

Treatments for PND include
 counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, which can be very 
effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also be offered for 
short-term use.

Some
 women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage,
 and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and 
anxiety.

Practical 
and emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a
 great help to those suffering from PND.  Getting out to meet other 
parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and 
anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an 
antidepressant.

Organisations such as the Association for Post-Natal Illness
 provides a telephone helpline for women who believe they are suffering 
from PND and for medical professionals.  Call 0207 386 0868 
Monday-Friday 10am-2pm.

Another helpline for those suffering from pre or post-natal depression is run by Pre And Post-Natal Depression Advice and Support and is staffed 9am-8pm on 0843 28 98 401.
