Millions of voters will be focusing the presidential candidates and their 'zingers' tonight in Denver, but plenty of attention has already been paid by organizers behind the scenes who have spent much time- and money- setting an even stage for this election's first presidential debate.

At 9pm ET, President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney will begin their orchestrated dance of appearing relaxed and candid even though they have been practicing their answers for weeks and timing every response down to the second.

The debate will last 90 minutes and is being broken up into six 15 minute segments.

Setting the stage: Staff prepare the Magnuss Arena in the Ritchie Center at the University of Colorado which will host the first presidential debate on Wednesday night

The focus of the first three segments are dedicated to the Economy (creatively titled Economy I, II, and III) before they move on to health care in the fourth segment, 'the role of government' in the fifth, and concluding on the issue of 'governing'.

Political analysts have speculated that the topic of the attacks on the American embassy in Libya, the Obama administration's handling of the situation, and Romney's criticism of their work could potentially be a hot-button topic at the debate, but the first debate is dedicated solely to domestic issues. The candidates may insert the issue into one of the more general segments (most likely the final portion on 'governing') it is not expected to be directly addressed.

While Obama is used to dictating the flow of discussion in the Oval Office and Romney touts his executive savvy from his years in the board room, neither will be the one in charge tonight as the reins have been handed over to Jim Lehrer.

Mr Lehrer is the former news anchor of PBS NewsHour and known more broadly for his frequent appearances at presidential debates. Nicknamed the 'Dean of Moderators', this will be his 12th time moderating a debate.

That tally is particularly impressive considering tonight's show will be the 36th televised presidential debate, meaning that Mr Lehrer has been at the helm of one third of all such debates.

Even though the title may be impressive, that doesn't mean that he ever wanted to earn it: after moderating one of the debates between Obama and his then-rival Senator John McCain in the 2008 election, Mr Lehrer wrote a book about his two-decades in the moderating business and swore that he would not commit to any more.

For a man known for his sterling reputation and reliability, he made the unusual move of reversing his decision after the Commission on Presidential Debates asked him to return to the chair to kick off the first of this year's three debates.

'I did say that and I meant that, with every bit of firmness I could muster,' Mr Lehrer told Politico referring to his vow not to moderate again.

'But I also have said that people who are invited to moderate these events-- you have to d it. It's almost like getting a draft notice.'

Mr Lehrer will begin each of the six segments by asking a question and both of the candidates will be given two minutes to answer. From there, the time will be spent having a conversation on the issue, with Mr Lehrer interjecting to steer the discussion or cut-off excessively-long answers.

The 78-year-old is known for being fair but firm, to both the candidates and to the audience.

Politico quotes his 2008 memoir on his moderating career, titled Tension City, as saying that while things may get heated on stage, the audience should stay cool and 'they are expected to remain absolutely silent during a debate.'

'They are invited guests, not participants. The moderator should remind the would-be cheerleaders and boobirds of the rules and enforce them when necessary,' he wrote.

In addition to the thousands of people who will be on the University of Denver campus and be filling the Magness Arena, 60million people are expected to tune in at home.

The preliminary headcount puts tonight's debate at a fairly standard level, as George Washington University reports that the size of the television audience for the three 2008 debates ranged from 52.4million to 63.2million.

One possible explanation for why analysts aren't predicting a higher headcount is because many voters are already rife with campaign fatigue: during the Republican primary, there were 20 televised debates between the ever-changing cast of candidates.

Regardless, tonight is pegged as the most important night-to-date in the seemingly endless campaign, since this is the first time that the two candidates will go at it face to face, as opposed to in the 30-second safety net of their scripted attack ads.

Adding to the competition of the night, Colorado is a battleground state for the two men, as Real Clear Politics reports that the President only holds a 3.1 per cent lead over Romney in the Centinnel State. That marks a sharp difference from 2008, when Obama carried the state with 9 per cent more of the vote than McCain.

The University of Denver is predictably pleased about their selection because the windfall of campaign staffers, political reporters and analysts means big business for the school. The Denver Post suggests that while it cost the University more than $1.6million to host the event, school administrators feel they can expect $20-30million in profits.

They will meet again two more times, with the second debate coming in Hempstead, New York on the 16th and their final showdown on the 22nd in Boca Raton, Florida.

Traditionally considered a toothless fight, this year’s vice presidential debate is hotly-anticipated because of Romney’s selection of Congressman Paul Ryan. The 42-year-old will face Vice President Joe Biden on October 11 in Danville, Kentucky.

Nicknamed the 'Dean of Moderators', this will be Jim Lehrer's 12th time moderating a debate and considering tonight's show will be the 36th televised presidential debate in U.S. history, meaning that Mr Lehrer has been at the helm of one third of all such debates.

After moderating one of the debates between Obama and his then-rival Senator John McCain in the 2008 election, Mr Lehrer wrote a book about his two-decades in the moderating business and swore that he would not commit to any more.

The 78-year-old is known for being fair but firm, to both the candidates and to the audience. In his book, Lehrer wrote that he feels the audience 'are invited guests, not participants. The moderator should remind the would-be cheerleaders and boobirds of the rules and enforce them when necessary.'

The television audience is expected to rank in at around 60million people, which is on the high end of a typical debate headcount.

The size of the television audience for the three 2008 debates ranged from 52.4million to 63.2million. All three of those debates were bested by the showdown between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin, whose performance at the vice presidential debate garnered 69.9million viewers.

In spite of heated campaign rhetoric over the Obama administration's handling of the attacks on the American embassy in Libya, the topic may not be specifically addressed on Wednesday because the debate is focused on domestic issues. That said, political analysts expect for the issue to be raised at some point by either Romney or Obama.

The debate will last 90 minutes and is being broken up into six 15 minute segments.

The focus of the first three segments are dedicated to the Economy (creatively titled Economy I, II, and III) before they move on to health care in the fourth segment, 'the role of government' in the fifth, and concluding on the issue of 'governing'.

The cost of hosting the event is expected to total more than $1.6million to host the event, but because of the thousands of visitors that come with the debate, school administrators feel they can expect $20-30million in profits.
