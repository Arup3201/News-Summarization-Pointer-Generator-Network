A Vietnam War veteran and former Marine rifleman, it is fair to say U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Don Nicholas has served his country well in his 59 years.

In fact, despite his 60th birthday fast approaching, he remains on active duty in Afghanistan. And yet, his biggest fear isn't spending another year on the front lines. To the contrary - it's retirement.

Nicholas, who will be ordered out of the battlefield this summer due to age restrictions, is fighting to re-enlist so that he can remain a soldier as long as he's physically and mentally able to fight.

According to the Wall Street Journal, 
the Army says Nicholas is the oldest of the 6,000 soldiers in the 25th 
Infantry Division in eastern Afghanistan.

Sergeant Nic, as he is called by 
younger soldiers, dropped out of high school and joined the Marines in 
1971, completing two tours in Vietman, including one at the U.S. Embassy
 in Saigon as enemy troops moved into the capital city.

He left active duty in 1978 to go to 
college, and in 1986 graduated from the Ohio College of Podiatric 
Medicine, and eventually started his own practice.

After the September 11 terrorist attacks, he attempted to re-enlist, but the Marines rejected his application.

The Ohio-based podiatrist was, 
however, accepted by the U.S. Army in 2004, and deployed to Afghanistan 
as part of an Army Reserves psychological-operations unit in Korengal 
Valley.

He returned home after duty, albeit 
breifly, and was sent to Iraq for 11 months. That tour was followed by a
 deployment this year to Kunar Province, along the Pakistan border in 
Afghanistan - where he serves on the front lines today.

Having served in three wars over 16 total years in service, the married father-of-two still feels a call to duty.

But he insists it's not due to a gross obsession with war.

'It's really not a fascination with 
war itself,' he told the Journal. 'It's more trying to keep people from 
getting killed. I'm taking the spot of some 19-year-old.'

Nevertheless, Pentagon regulations will require him to retire in July when he turns 60.

'If I have my chance to stay in and complete my 20 years. I absolutely would,' he said.

'Probably would stay in a few more years after that if I could.'

Nicholas told the Journal he hopes to 
receive a commission in the Army medical branch which would allow him a 
chance to stay in the Army. He could also be eligible through the commission to complete another tour in Afghanistan.Â
