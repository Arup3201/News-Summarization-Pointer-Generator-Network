Nicky Morgan, the new education secretary, who will announce that toddlers are to be taught 'fundamental British values'

Children as young as two are at risk of religious extremism and must be taught 'fundamental British values' to combat radicalism, the new Education Secretary will warn today.

Nicky Morgan will urge local authorities to  use new powers to strip funding from nurseries found to promote extremist views.

Also under the proposed rules, nurseries that teach creationism – the rejection of evolutionary theory – as scientific fact will also have their taxpayer funding cut.

Mrs Morgan, who replaced Michael Gove as Education  Secretary in last month’s Cabinet reshuffle, will say: ‘One of the most important roles of the education system is that it should prepare young people for life in modern Britain.

‘I am clear that public money should not be used to support any school or early years provider that does not support this aim because it seeks to promote ideas and teachings than run counter to fundamental British values.

‘There can be no place for extremist views anywhere in the education system. The changes we are making today will ensure all early years providers and schools are aligned with the need to protect children from views that are considered extreme.’

It is understood the teaching of British values is likely to include ‘challenging negative attitudes and stereotypes’. Children will also be taught how to take turns and share and the difference between right and wrong.

The announcement comes in the wake of the recent ‘Trojan Horse’ scandal, a hardline Muslim plot to take over primary and secondary state schools in Birmingham.

Mrs Morgan hopes the rules will come into effect in the New Year following a consultation in September.

Ofsted will inspect early years providers on promoting of fundamental  British values. The proposals are designed to bring nurseries into line with similar tough measures in schools. It is the first time the Government has warned that toddlers could be at risk from extremist views.

Mrs Morgan is said to be worried about the risks of nurseries linked to radical mosques run by Islamic hardliners. There are also concerns within Government that councils need more power to respond if there are allegations of extremist views.

The announcement follows a consultation on local authority early years funding arrangements.

There are currently no explicit rules that allow local authorities, which provide funding to nurseries that meet Ofsted requirements, to stop funding churches or mosques with extremist views.

However, it is understood there is no concrete intelligence of any individual nurseries needing immediate action. A mysterious letter which described ‘Operation Trojan Horse’ – an apparent plot by Muslim fundamentalists to take over Birmingham’s schools – sparked a series of school inspections in the city.

It was passed to the council, head teachers, unions and media outlets, sparking four separate investigations. Purportedly written as a guide for fellow hardliners in Bradford, the unsigned and undated letter itself is now viewed as an elaborate hoax.

However, Ofsted found evidence of an ‘organised campaign’ to change the character of some schools, while calling for further investigation of others. It inspected 21 schools in the city, concluding a ‘culture of intimidation’ had developed in some.

Five schools were placed in special measures: Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy – all run by the Park View Educational Trust (PVET), as well as Oldknow Academy and Saltley School. A sixth, Alston Primary, was already in special measures.

Takeover plot: Park View School in Birmingham was at the centre of the allegations

The so-called Trojan Horse plot first came to light earlier this year.

Department for Education inspectors were ordered into Park View School in Birmingham along with its sister schools, Golden Hillock and Nansen, after a letter dubbed 'Trojan Horse' - now thought to be a hoax - was uncovered.

It allegedly outlined a plot by Muslim hardliners to drive moderate headteachers out of schools.

Whistleblowers at Park View have claimed the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the governing body.

It is alleged girls at the school were forced to sit at the back of the classroom and non-Muslim pupils forced to teach themselves at the state school.

The letter prompted separate ongoing investigations by both the Department for Education (DfE) and Ofsted in to the school and several others in the area.

Police, the Government and school inspectors are thought to be investigating alleged attempts by radicals to seize control of 20 schools in the city after claims of plot emerged in March.

The DfE has also appointed its own education commissioner, the former head of the Metropolitan Police’s counter-terrorism unit Peter Clarke for the investigation.

Yesterday, six schools at the centre of an alleged Islamist takeover plot are facing radical reform and even  closure after being officially judged as failing, it emerged last night.

A three-month inquiry has found the Birmingham schools did too little to protect children from extremism and female staff were intimidated.

One of the six, Golden Hillock, was rated ‘inadequate’ in every criteria. A leaked copy of its Ofsted report says ‘staff views are polarised’ about leadership and that sex and relationships education has not been delivered properly.

However, three were today given 'outstanding' or 'good' results by the education watchdog.
