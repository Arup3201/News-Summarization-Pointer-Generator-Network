Burglars who were spotted breaking into a shop were still able to spend three hours getting in and steal £5,000 worth of goods - after police were sent to the wrong village.

The thieves were seen sawing a hole in a Spar door in Combe Martin, Devon, by a member of the public who immediately dialled 999.

But instead of directing police to Combe Martin, emergency operators sent two squad cars five miles away to Illfracombe.

'Devastated': Owner Sue Sussex, 61, checked her CCTV and established the burglars spent three and a half hours at her premises in the raid last Friday morning at 1am

The bemused officers who found nothing happening are believed to have then returned to their headquarters, thinking it was a mix-up or a false alarm.

Police blunder: Mrs Sussex said she had 'no idea why how they could make this sort of mistake'

Meanwhile the burglars were able to get into the shop and made off with £5,400 worth of alcohol and cigarettes.

Owner Sue Sussex, 61, checked her CCTV and established the burglars spent three and a half hours at her premises in the raid last Friday morning at 1am.

She said: ‘They tried everything to get in but the shop is so secure it took them hours. The police would have literally caught them red-handed had they come to the right place.

‘I know the person who made the 999 call. He gave them all the correct information, the location and said it was happening right then.

‘I have no idea why how they could make this sort of mistake. It's such a drastic mistake. I'm absolutely devastated.’

A Devon and Cornwall Constabulary spokesman told MailOnline: 'A formal complaint has been received about this matter and as is usual in these cases we are unfortunately able to make any comment until this complaint has been dealt with.

'I can however confirm that inquiries have now begun in relation to the complaint and officers from the professional standards department will endeavour to resolve this matter as quickly as possible.'
