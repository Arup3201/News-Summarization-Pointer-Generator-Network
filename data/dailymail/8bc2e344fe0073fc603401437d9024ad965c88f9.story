These heart-breaking pictures show a plucky gnu try to escape the jaws of hungry crocodiles before ending up as dinner.

The series starts as three gnus leap into a crocodile and hippopotamus infested river in the Masaï Mara National Reserve in Kenya.

Suddenly a scaly head launches at one of the straggling creatures and jaws clamp on to its hind legs.

The series starts as three brave - and foolish - gnus leap into a crocodile and hippopotamus infested river in the Masaï Mara National Reserve

The photos show a scaly head suddenly launching at one of the straggling creatures and jaws clamp onto the animal's hind legs

In a vain attempt to escape, the gnu flails its legs to create a splash barrier before finally losing its footing on a wet rock.

Photographer Laurent Renaud said: 'It was difficult to watch as the poor gnu failed in its battle to survive.

'About 50 tried to cross the river but there was just this one unlucky one.

'The rest of the herd managed to get to a resting rock in the middle of the river and escape.' 

The plucky gnu does its best to escape the jaws of hungry crocodiles in the water, but it eventually loses the battle and ends up as dinner

About 50 gnus tried to cross the river but there was just one that was unlucky enough to end up in the jaws of a hungry crocodile

Laurent thinks the gnus made the treacherous journey to get to a fresh patch of grass on the other side. The French photographer said: 'It was not necessary for them to cross the river.

'They did it because they were greedy and wanted the fresh grass.

'They never realize how dangerous the crossing is until the crocodile gets near them.

'By that point it's too late.'

The large crocodiles have a powerful bite, easily overpowering gnus that are unlucky enough to become trapped in their strong jaws

The unlucky gnu was left behind by rest of the herd who managed to get to a resting rock in the middle of the river and escape the crocodiles
