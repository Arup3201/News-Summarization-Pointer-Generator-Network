The last big piece of wreckage of the AirAsia jet that crashed into the Java Sea in December has been brought back to land.

Flight QZ8501 went down on December 28 in stormy weather, during what was supposed to be a short trip from Indonesia to Singapore, claiming the lives of 162 passengers.

Salvage crews on Friday pulled a huge chunk of the Airbus 320-200's fuselage and wings from the sea and loaded it on to a ship, said national search and rescue chief Bambang Soelistyo. 

Today it arrived at Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.

Wreck: Police officers examine the newly-recovered remains of the fuselage of AirAsia Flight 8501 on the deck of rescue ship Crest Onyx at Tanjung Priok port in Jakarta, Indonesia. Authorities say this is the last big piece of the ill-fated passenger jet to be brought to the surface

Recovery: A crane lifts the mangled wreck from the rescue ship and on to the harbour earlier today, after it was pulled from the Java sea on Friday. The plane crashed on December 28 during a short flight from Indonesia to Singapore, claiming the lives of 162 passengers

Big job: The wreckage was securely lashed with metal cables before it was lifted from the deck of the Crest Onyx and lifted to the quayside

Destroyed: The extensive damage to the Airbus 320-200 can be seen as it is laid down on the concrete floor of the quayside

Evidence: Bleached white bones and damaged mobile phones discovered inside the wreck, which was brought to the surface on Friday

Safety first: A safety information card found by wreckage search and rescue teams while examining the fuselage

'We have retrieved on Friday the last and large part of the AirAsia fuselage with a wing still intact,' Mr Soelistyo told AFP.

No bodies were found during the course of the operation, he said, but photographs of the wreckage taken today showed bleached white bones among the debris and personal possessions inside the wreck.

As he revealed the salvage milestone on Saturday, Mr Soelistyo said authorities will decide on a date to conclude work after a meeting with the victims' families scheduled for this week.

Only 103 of the 162 victims of the air crash have been found so far. The AirAsia jet went down on its way to Singapore from the Indonesian city of Surabaya.

One of the bodies already recovered was that of British energy company executive Choi Chi-Man, 48, who was flying with his two-year-old daughter Zoe. His wife Mei-Yi Wee and son Luca survived after catching an earlier flight.

Search: A search and rescue team member steps carefully around the twisted metal and cables of the fuselage wreck 

Securely lashed: An engineer checks that the huge pile of mangled metal is well secured before a crane lifts it to the quayside

Sad: Authorities will decide on a date to conclude salvage work after a meeting with the victims' families scheduled for this week

Tragedy: Moments before the crash the pilot radioed air traffic control, who denied his request to be allowed to climb above a storm

Indonesian authorities have said they expect to release their final report into the crash by August. Officials have been reticent about revealing any more details in advance of that report.

The country's National Transportation Safety Committee has confirmed French co-pilot Remi Plesel was flying the plane, not former fighter jet pilot Captain Iriyanto.

The plane climbed from 32,000 feet to well above 37,000 feet in 30 seconds, officials said, likely in an attempt to avoid a menacing storm. It is believed that it quickly returned to 32,000 feet before 'gradually' descending towards the sea.

Moments before the crash the pilot radioed air traffic control to report a storm ahead and asked to be allowed to climb above it, but was told the airspace was too busy.

Under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidelines, the state conducting the investigation should release a final report within a year of the accident.
