Migrants arriving from the European Union could be required to register with police as part of the immigration reforms announced yesterday by David Cameron, it has been reported.

Mr Cameron hopes that the new packet of measures, which the Tories say they will implement if they regain power in the general election in May, will work to cut overall levels of immigration by making it harder to stay in Britain without a job.

But critics were quick to point out that it would be difficult to monitor and deport any out-of-work migrants - arguing that they were unlikely to appear on official databases.

Reform: Mr Cameron hopes that the new packet of measures he announced during a speech yesterday (pictured) will work to cut overall levels of immigration by making it harder to stay in Britain without a job

Now the Daily Telegraph has reported that the solution might be in a controversial scheme that would see migrants being forced to register at a police station on their arrival.  

Setting out his plans yesterday, Mr Cameron said that unemployed EU migrants will be banned from receiving state support, and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving.

The Prime Minister believes it could dramatically reduce Britain's appeal to workers in central and eastern Europe, who are able to top-up their incomes with in-work benefits like tax credits. 

But questions were raised over how authorities would keep track of whether migrants gained employment, stating that it the proposed deportations wouldn't be possible without this information.

The answer might be requiring immigrants to sign in with police on their arrival, an unnamed source has told the Daily Telegraph.

The policy would mean that an individual could be monitored - and deported from the UK if they were still unemployed after six months. 

FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU:

No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years

No social housing for four years

No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK

FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS:

No support from the UK taxpayer

Deportation if they do not get a job for six months

Other measures include:

Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU

Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK

Tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals

Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels

The source said: 'We are considering all options. And requiring migrants to sign in and register is one of the things we are looking at.'

The practice is common in a number of other countries, and minister believe it would be straightforward to set up a similar scheme here. 

Mr Cameron has abandoned an attempt to impose a limit on the number of people who can come to Britain, despite latest figures showing a record rise in EU immigration.

Aides concede the idea of a cap or an 'emergency brake' if the number of migrants from individual countries suddenly soared, were too complex to implement.

Several senior EU figures had warned it would be illegal and breach the fundamental right to free movement across the continent.

Today Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond denied that Mr Cameron 'backed off' his plans in the face of pressure from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 

Mr Hammond acknowledged that ministers had consulted with other EU member states ahead of Mr Cameron's long-awaited speech. 

However, he rejected reports that the Prime Minister had dropped plans for a cap following the intervention of Mrs Merkel, who has made no secret of her opposition to any measures which undermine the principle of the free movement of labour within the EU.

He said: 'I don't think that is right. What is right is that we have sought to work with our partners in the European Union to understand the best way of delivering a reduction in immigration numbers from the EU in to the UK.' 

Instead, Mr Cameron has focused on a package of measures limiting access to benefits which is much more draconian than anything proposed to date by Labour or the Lib Dems.

Yesterday in a speech at a JCB factory in Staffordshire, Mr Cameron announced the measures intended to make it more difficult to stay without a job.

He said that, a new fund will also be promised in the Tory General Election manifesto to help areas worst affected by dramatic influxes of immigrants.  

He believes it could dramatically reduce Britain's appeal to workers in central and eastern Europe, who are able to top-up their incomes with in-work benefits like tax credits.

The Prime Minister demanded the new rules to apply to countries joining the EU, ensuring their economies must reach a certain level before free movement of their citizens is allowed.

The reform would be designed to eliminate the overwhelming economic pull for people to move from poor countries to richer ones. 

At least seven countries, including Turkey, have suggested they want to join the EU.

Mr Cameron made clear that without agreement on allowing the UK to dramatically curtail the pull factors which make it so attractive to EU migrants, he will 'rule nothing out' – raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way.

The Tory leader has promised that if he is Prime Minister after the next election he will renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. 

He said: 'It is not wrong to express concern about the scale of people coming into the country.

'People have understandably become frustrated. It boils down to one word: control.'

While his proposed curbs on benefits will apply to existing EU countries, he wants to go further for new member states.

The PM insisted that if his renegotiation of EU membership is a success he will campaign to keep Britain in.
