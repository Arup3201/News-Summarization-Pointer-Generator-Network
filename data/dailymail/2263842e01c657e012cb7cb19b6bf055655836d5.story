Newcastle United vs Sunderland (St James' Park) 

Team news

Newcastle United 

Jak Alnwick will retain his place in goal for Newcastle's derby showdown with Sunderland on Sunday.

The 21-year-old has recovered from the shoulder problem he suffered during Wednesday night's 4-0 Capital One Cup defeat at Tottenham and will continue to deputise for the injured Tim Krul (ankle) and Rob Elliot (thigh), while full-back Daryl Janmaat will return from a one-game ban.

Manager Alan Pardew will assess striker Papiss Cisse, who missed the game at White Hart Lane with a virus, while defender Steven Taylor and midfielders Cheick Tiote and Sammy Ameobi (muscle strains) are hopeful of being fit.

Provisional squad: Pantilimon, Mannone, Reveillere, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Coates, Cattermole, Rodwell, Bridcutt, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Alvarez, Mavrias, Giaccherini, Fletcher, Wickham, Altidore.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Newcastle are without a win in three against Sunderland at St James Park, losing the last two 3-0.

Sunderland are unbeaten in their last five Premier League games against Newcastle United (W3 D2), winning the last three in a row.

The Black Cats have never won four successive league derbies against Newcastle United.

There have been five red cards in the last eight Premier League meetings between these two sides, though none in the last three.

No side has picked up more yellow cards than Sunderland (37) this season, while only Swansea (4) have more red cards than Newcastle (3).

Sunderland's Darren Bent, Phil Bardsley and Danny Welbeck look on as Newcastle players celebrate Kevin Nolan's first strike in a 5-1 Premier League win for the Toon at St James' Park in October 2010. Nolan grabbed a hat-trick on the day which remains Newcastle's last home win over their bitter rivals

If matches ended a half-time this season, Newcastle United would be bottom of the table with 12 points.

The Magpies have been leading at half-time in just one of their 16 Premier League games this season.

Sunderland have scored three goals in the opening five minutes of PL games this season; more than any other side.

Sunderland have drawn 10 matches this season, the joint-most by a team in the first 16 games of a Premier League season (along with Ipswich Town in 1992/93).

Papiss Cisse has scored five goals in his last seven Premier League appearances as a substitute, but has netted just four goals in his last 26 PL starts.
