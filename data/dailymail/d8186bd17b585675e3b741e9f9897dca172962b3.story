A couple who made a staggering £350,000 selling stolen make-up and perfume on eBay have been jailed. 

Dariusz Suski and Joanna Lazarska from Southsea, Hampshire, listed designer perfume and skincare on the online auctioneers, taking bids from all over the world on the stolen luxury goods.

The couple, aged 32 and 33 respectively, have been jailed for four years after a trial heard how they operated the illegal business round the clock. 

Dariusz Suski and Joanna Lazarska have been jailed after making £350,000 by selling stolen goods online

Police found 11,000 individual products at their home in Southsea, Hampshire, including expensive Clinique and Crem de la Mer face creams

Portsmouth Crown Court heard how the couple sourced stolen goods including Tom Ford perfume, Clinique moisturiser and Creme de la Mer face creams, from people they met on eBay. 

They then listed the products on their own auction pages and invited bidders to buy them at discounted prices. 

When searching the couple's home, police found 11,000 individual products shelved in packaging. 

The pair denied conspiring to handle stolen goods, but were found guilty of a jury. 

Sentencing Judge Sarah Munro QC said they had become 'obsessed' with the illegal trade. 

'You were both obsessed with this business and operated, at times, 24 hours a day.

'The sum of money flowing through your eBay, Paypal and bank accounts was huge.

'Your offending was both sophisticated and carefully planned and executed. 

'If anything Miss Lazarska, you were the more accomplished businesswoman.

'Some of your suppliers had access in such large quantities that they must have been stolen.

'You were clearly both extremely knowledgeable of the nature of the products.

'Your knowledge was extraordinary and in some ways more than the security manager of Estee Lauder.'

The couple were kept in supply by Radoslaw Ozgowicz who worked for the French beauty company in warehouses. 

The 36-year-old stole 40 to 50 items from factories every day, pocketing £62,000 from the scheme. 

He is due to be sentenced next month. Others including Richard Powell, 45, and Ramszesz Harangoza, 35, were jailed for their roles in the operation.  

Detective Sergeant Anton Gaita of Hampshire Police said: 'The couple stored and sold on hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of stolen beauty products.

'The pair were motivated by financial gain and made about £350,000 in online sales marketing the products as discounted factory goods only slightly below the normal retail price.

'All the beauty products had been taken out of the supply chain, so there’s no way of knowing whether they’d been stored in the correct conditions or whether they’d been exposed to contamination.'
