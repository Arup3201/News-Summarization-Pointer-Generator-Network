The American Geophysical Union has definitively linked climate change to humanity’s reliance on fossil fuels.

In a statement, the Union said that humanity is the major influence on the global climate change observed over the past 50 years.

It claimed that human-caused increases in
greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed global 
average surface warming of roughly 0.8°C (1.5°F) over the past 140 
years.

'There is only one thing that is going straight up … that is the greenhouse gases that we are just pumping at an exponential rate,' Gerald North, an atmospheric scientist at Texas A&M University who chaired the committee responsible for the statement, told NBC News.

‘Extensive, independent observations confirm the reality of global warming,’ said the statement.

‘These changes are broadly consistent with long understood physics and predictions of how the climate system is expected to respond to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases. 

‘The changes are inconsistent with explanations of climate change that rely on known natural influences.’

The union said the consequences of continuing on this path include deforestation, urbanisation, and particulate pollution which can have complex geographical, seasonal, and longer-term effects on temperature.

It added that there is time to lessen the impact by cutting emissions and preparing for changes that are unavoidable.

The American Geophysical Union is an organisation with over 62,000 members of Earth and space scientists who come from 144 countries. 

A 15-person panel reviewed and updated the position statement- a task which is done every four years.

However, one committee member, Roger Pielke Senior, who is a retired professor of atmospheric sciences at Colorado State University, opposed the statement. 

Speaking to Georgia Tech climate scientist Judith Curry, Pielke said the statement was an inaccurate view of climate change dominated by the emission of carbon dioxide and a few other greenhouse gases. 

He said that during the review process, other views were never given an adequate opportunity to be discussed.

‘The natural Earth’s climate system, even in the absence of humans, is nonlinear in which forcings and response are not necessarily proportional,’ said Pielke, offering his own explanation.

‘Thus change is often episodic and abrupt, rather than slow and gradual.’

Pielke said that climate change is the result of both human and natural changes.

He concluded: ‘The relative role of each in altering atmospheric and ocean circulation features, and even the global annual average radiative forcing, however, is still uncertain.’

American scientists claim the planet is undergoing one of the largest changes in climate in the past 65 million years.Climatologists at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment have warned the likely rate of change over the next century will be at least 10 times quicker than any climate shift since the dinosaurs became extinct.If the trend continues at its current rapid pace, it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world, and many species will need to make behavioral, evolutionary or geographic adaptations to survive, they said.The findings come from a review of climate research by Earth system science expert Noah Diffenbaugh and Chris Field, a professor of environmental Earth system science and the director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Institution.
