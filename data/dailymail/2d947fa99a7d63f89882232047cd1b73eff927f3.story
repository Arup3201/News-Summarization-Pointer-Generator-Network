A woman who felt she was 'ugly' after her violent husband knocked out most of her teeth has turned her life around after winning a new set on a Romanian TV show. 

Gabriela Ionescu, 32, from the north-western Romanian city of Carei, married young so she would be able to leave home - but her husband had been violent and abusive.

When she finally left him at 27, he had already smashed out the majority of her teeth.

Insecure and scared of being alone, she had quickly married again - this time to a man who called her 'old and useless'.

She said he used her like domestic help, and nicknamed her 'death on holiday'. 

Ms Ionescu had hoped people would be able to see the 'real Gabriela' despite her looks, but quickly realised appearance mattered. 

'I felt old and ugly and I was ugly, and people used to avoid me in the street,' she said.

'I didn't want to go visit people because I couldn't eat anything other than soup, and my husband was constantly telling me I was old and useless and that didn't help, I didn't have any sense of my own worth.'

Her life changed after spotting a advert on television calling for applicants for a new reality show.

The show offered to provided people around the country with free plastic surgery, in exchange for the right to film the process.

Ms Ionescu added: 'I don't know why I decided to apply but I did and was amazed when I was accepted, and got a new set of teeth which had been impossible to afford before.'

And when she saw the improvement in her appearance, she said it made her feel good about herself, and gave the strength to ditch her husband.

She said: 'I've got a new life, I feel excellent, I'm happy. I have different friends and only good people around me.'

She added the improvement in her appearance made her feel good about herself and gave her the strength to leave her second husband
