If you haven't yet heard of Tallia Storm, you soon will. She's only 15-years-old but she's already performed to thousands, signed a record deal and found a mentor in Sir Elton John. 

The talented teenager from Balfron, Stirlingshire, jokes she's a 'real life Hannah Montana' as she juggles her school work with her fledgling singing career.

Like the character played by Miley Cyrus, Tallia is a diligent school girl by day and then performs and rubs shoulders with the stars by night.

Rising star: Tallia Storm, 15, has signed a recording contract with Virgin Records

Her path to stardom began when she was just 13 and had a chance encounter with Elton John's partner David Furnish while on holiday with her family.

The producer was staying at the same hotel and Tallia plucked up the courage to hand him her demo CD in the hope he and the famous singer would listen to it.

She recalled: 'There he was having breakfast, I 
wrote a note and put my CD in an envelope and just walked up to his 
table.

Next big thing: Virgin Records say Tallia is a 'one-in-a-zillion talent'

'I took my
 wee brothers for moral support - they were five and seven-years-old so I was 
hoping he wouldn't be able to resist a quick chat. I just introduced myself and asked if he would pass it on.

'He was absolutely charming and so nice. He asked where I was from and what kind of music I liked. That was it. I sat back down at my table and we literally checked out of the hotel and left, with me thinking - oh well I tried.'

Days later she was stunned when she received a call from the Rocket Man himself.

Tallia was about to fly back to UK from 
San Francisco when she picked up the phone to Elton, who was so 
impressed with her recordings he invited her to open his show.

She said: 'When I got the call from Elton it was like something out of a comedy. There we 
were going through security at San Francisco airport and my mobile rang -
 he just said, "Hello is that Tallia? It's Elton here".

'My mum 
was stressing and shouting at us all, my dad was his doing his own thing
 and my sister was three places ahead of us in the queue.

'I 
realised my battery was about to die and the big security guard suddenly
 shouted and said you're not allowed to be on your phone going through 
security.

'So there I was trying to explain the situation to Elton and the phone just died. It was chaotic.

'After we got through security my big sister swapped sim card to her phone and I finally got to speak to Sir Elton.'

She spent 
six months rehearsing and then took to the stage at the beginning of one of 
his concerts for a lengthy five-song 25 minute slot.

Music moguls were as impressed with her soulful voice as Sir Elton and she's now been signed up by Virgin Records - who count Katy Perry and J Lo among their clients. 

The company's chief creative officer and executive vice president Ron Fair said: 'Tallia Storm is a one-in-a-zillion talent and an extraordinary 15-year-old well beyond her years. Her soulful vocals come from a deep place combined with her great melodic gift, beauty and intellect.

'Virgin Records is thrilled she is joining our roster.'

Living the high life: But when Tallia isn't performing or recording she says she's just an average school girl

Tallia said she was 'over the moon' to gain the recording contract and now spends half her time at school preparing for her exams and the rest jetting across the world to top class recording studios and red carpet events.

She has shared a recording studio with Daft Punk, been a guest singer at London Fashion Week and performed at the Teen Choice Awards after party.

She said: 'Now my life is very Hannah Montana. During the week I'm just a regular kid, I just finished my National 5'S (GCSE's) at my local school Balfron High in Stirlingshire and I worked like a dog for them.

'Then after school, I do gigs and sing, sing, sing. At weekends I travel a lot to events, photoshoots and gigs but when I'm home, it's just back to normality.'
