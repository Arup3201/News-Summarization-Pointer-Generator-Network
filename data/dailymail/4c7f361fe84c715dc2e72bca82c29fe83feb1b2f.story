When Sean Geddes is not helping make components for Lewis Hamilton’s car he scores goals, plenty of them, and sometimes in great style.

Not content with the two goals that knocked former winners Coventry out of the FA Cup first round, the Worcester City forward followed that up last weekend with a wonder strike that drew unlikely comparisons with Erik Lamela and Lionel Messi.

The opposition might only have been Barrow in the FA Trophy but his ‘rabona’ chip of the goalkeeper was a breathtaking piece of skill that has proved a viral internet hit the world over, with nearly two million hits on social media.

It has all added up to a slightly disconcerting few weeks for the 22-year-old former Manchester United trainee, who works as a turner at specialist engineering firm A&M EDM Ltd in the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands, down the road from West Brom’s Hawthorns stadium.

In the reception area is a Mercedes poster, signed by Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, sent out to the contractors who made contributions to this year’s F1 championship success.

Yet if they thought their contribution to the sporting world would end with doing some bodywork on Hamilton’s winning car, they reckoned without the magnetism of the FA Cup, which sees their employee travel with Worcester to Scunthorpe today for the second round.

And then there was the footage of the Barrow goal going global. For Geddes, who lives a short cycle ride to work, notoriety has taken some getting used to.

‘Suddenly I’m getting messages from all over, from a mate who lives in Norway, where they’ve been talking about it apparently, and a friend who is at university in America,’ he says. ‘There has been a lot about it on Twitter. I’m on Twitter but don’t really know it works.

‘The rabona is just something I’ve played around with since I was about eight. If I try it in training, a few people tell me to stop messing about. But I didn’t really think about it last weekend, it was just something I did on instinct.

‘It has been a bit weird and I’m not really used to this. I’m used to just living a quiet life and getting on with my work and my football.’

The day after knocking out Coventry in front of more than 3,000 travelling Worcester fans, Geddes was back in the factory for his shift, which begins at six o’clock each morning.

In an era when even non-League players can live off their wages, and sometimes opt not to do much outside their training more strenuous than PlayStation, he is decidedly old school, a proper working man.

He helps operate the complex moulding machines, learning the trade at the factory where his mum, Jo, has worked for seven years, and will sometimes work on Saturday mornings before a home fixture.

‘We got back from Coventry and I went to my local pub for a pint but I couldn’t really celebrate because I knew I was getting up early in the morning,’ he says. ‘That doesn’t bother me. I enjoy working and I know that whatever happens football can be a short career.

‘I could probably live off my football money but I’m saving for a deposit to buy a house. Everyone in the factory is football mad and talks about it all the time but, to be honest, I’m not that interested in the game other than I just love playing it. I don’t watch much or follow a team.’

How much longer he will happily toil away on the shopfloor is unclear because his goalscoring record and what happened against Barrow has alerted a host of League clubs.

‘I’d still love to get back into the professional game and I’m aware that this weekend is another chance to be in the shop window,’ he says.

His previous experience of the big time was two years spent at Old Trafford as a teenager, where he played in the same teams as Danny Welbeck and Ravel Morrison.

‘Danny was a quiet lad, he was a bit older than me but I was always playing two years above myself so I didn’t know him that well. Ravel was totally the opposite.

‘I shared a room with him a few times, they put me in with him because I’m fairly quiet and sensible and they thought I would calm him down. It didn’t work. He just wanted to do practical jokes all the time. He used to cut my socks off and things like that but I liked him.

‘Danny was something different, you could tell he was going to be very good. Ravel is also one of the best I’ve seen. If only he knew how good he could be, the way he goes past players and reads the game, he could be playing for England by now.’

Having started at Coventry, Geddes was at Manchester from 14 to 16 before moving closer to home for a three-year contract with Walsall.

‘I fell out with the manager there. He said we were playing well when we were losing a game 4-1 to Preston and we had an argument. He sent me away on loan.’

After ending up at Stourbridge, earlier this season he moved to Conference North Worcester, where he has already scored nine goals in 17 games.

They lie eighth in their league, although these have been uncertain times at the club, who are currently having to groundshare with Kidderminster. Despite that there is a new enthusiasm around and they will not lack for support at Scunthorpe, who are fourth from bottom in League One.

‘At Coventry the fans were unbelievable, singing from start to finish,’ says Geddes. ‘It was the definitely the best moment for me in football and it makes us believe we can go further.’
