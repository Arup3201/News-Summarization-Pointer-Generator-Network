He splashed out one million dollars customizing his plush New York apartment - but now fraudster Peter Madoff is having to sell the luxury Park Avenue pad as he faces up to ten years in jail.

Mr Madoff, the younger brother of disgraced 
financier Bernard Madoff - and loyal No. 2 at an investment firm that 
fronted a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme - will be sentenced in October.

He worked as his brother's chief compliance officer, and last month admitted to faking documents and other crimes, although he said he was unaware the investment business was a sham. 

Peter Madoff's luxury apartment in Park Avenue is on the market for $4 million

Madoff spent $1million renovating the pad after buying it in 2004

The apartment has a state-of-the-art kitchen and even boasts an ensuite 'maid's room'

All proceeds from the flat's sale will be handed over to the U.S. Marshals

No expense was spared renovating the wood-paneled property which boasts some fine original features

The apartment boasts two luxuriously decorated bedrooms and a large dining room

Close to $20 billion vanished in the 
scam, the largest Ponzi scheme ever prosecuted in the U.S.

The scheme 
left behind only a few hundred million dollars, not the $65 billion 
claimed in bogus financial statements.

Peter Madoff has had to sell off millions of dollars worth of property since pleading guilty to conspiracy and falsifying records earlier this year.

The proceeds of these sales have been handed over to the U.S. Marshals as part of an agreement he signed with the government.

And now his wife Marion has put his $4 million Park Avenue apartment on the market to raise more funds.

The 2,300-sq ft, two-bedroom flat, which boasts stunning views of Manhattan, is being sold for around $100,000 less than the family paid for it in 2004.

The apartment is located in one of New York's most desirable neighbourhoods

The plush pad is described by estate agents Prudential Douglas Elliman as newly refurbished and as being  'in mint condition.'

It features two bedrooms plus a maid's 
quarters, 'each with their own full ensuite windowed bathroom as well as
a separate half bath for guests.'

The flat, located in the Upper East Side, boasts 'wonderful city views' and a 'state of the art windowed kitchen' featuring the full range of mod cons, including a 'Sub-Zero refrigerator, 'Viking range' and a 'beverage cooler.'

Built in 1929 the apartment has a wood burning fireplace as well as 'pre-war details like beamed ceilings, a wood burning fireplace and beautiful hardwood floors throughout.'

Peter Madoff's Palm Beach house has already been auctioned off to raise 
funds.

Marion Madoff has to sell both the Manhattan apartment and the family's $5.3 million Long Island house by January or hand them over to the government.

In May last year she sold the 
couple's Palm Beach mansion for $5.5million.

It had originally gone on 
the market in January for $6.5million, but she was forced to drop the 
asking price.
