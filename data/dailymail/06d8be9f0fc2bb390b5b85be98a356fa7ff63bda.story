Rolando Aarons has been the surprise star of Newcastle United’s pre-season preparations.

The 18-year-old scored one and created another during the Magpies’ 3-1 victory over Schalke on Sunday.

He had terrorised his Champions League opponents throughout and won  praise from manager Alan Pardew after the game.

So who is the teenage talent? Sportsmail was at the Veltins Arena this weekend and here we fill you in on the boy who could emerge as a new Toon favourite this season. 

In a nutshell, who is he?

Rolando Aarons was born in Kingston in Jamaica but moved to the UK as a child. He was snapped up by Bristol City’s academy but Newcastle were soon aware of his potential and brought him to Tyneside as a 16-year-old.

He scored a goal and created another against Schalke, sounds like an attacking player?

That he most certainly is. A left-footed left-winger – yes, they do still exist – Aarons is all about the offensive.

And his strengths?

He’s quick with a boxful of tricks to boot. He has a low centre of gravity, the ability to wriggle between opponents and is a robust sort who looks like he’ll bounce back from any meaty treatment served upon him.

Tell us more about his performance this weekend?

He was bright in the 3-1 defeat against Malaga on Saturday but took centre stage against the hosts 24 hours later. On 10 minutes he turned his full back inside and out before landing an enticing centre onto the forehead of Emmanuel Riviere, who did the rest with a smart finish.

His goal arrived after the break and, while a little fortuitous, it was well deserved. He escaped two blue shirts down the left flank before sweeping a cross-cum-shot to the far post where it sailed over the head of the goalkeeper before creeping into the side-netting. He later told manager Alan Pardew it was intended, however.

Does he remind you of anyone?

Jamaican-born left-winger who qualifies to play for England... a certain John Barnes springs to mind but so, too, does Raheem Sterling.

Aarons boasts all of the same attributes as the the Liverpool star and is strikingly similar in build and style.

He does say that his favourite player is Hatem Ben Arfa, his Newcastle team-mate who Pardew has cast aside after questioning his professionalism. Perhaps the manager would be happier if he found a new role model.

Has he played for the first-team before?

Not in a competitive match. He has progressed through the club’s youth and reserve teams during the past two seasons but is expected to make that step up this time around.

And at international level?

It’s perhaps a little too early for that, but given his dual nationality we dare say the FA have taken note.

What does his manager say about him?

‘Rolando’s the sort of player the fans will love – he’s obviously very quick,’ Pardew has said previously.

‘He plays left side and gets crosses in, which is something we haven’t got in the group. He enjoys playing that role.

‘We’ve had a couple of left-footed players who don’t actually like playing that side, but he has the pace to trouble any full back.’

After the game against Schalke, Pardew told us: ‘The real highlight of pre-season has been Rolando and he was terrific again.

‘It’s nice to see a young player really pushing and I thought he caused real problems for Schalke – long may that continue.’

Long may that continue indeed, we’re certainly hoping he is given a chance to shine this season.

Full of praise: Newcastle boss Alan Pardew has been impressed by the form of Aarons
