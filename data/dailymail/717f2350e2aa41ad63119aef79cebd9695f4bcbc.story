Tens of thousands of protestors marched through central Paris yesterday, angry at the French government legalisation of same sex marriage.

The historic Esplanade des Invalides in the 7th arrondissement was a sea of protesters waving trademark pink and blue flags.

As night fell, several hundred protesters clashed with police, throwing bottles and chasing journalists.

Interior Minister Manuel Valls said 
police had arrested around 100 far-right protesters who refused to leave
following the end of the demonstration. Riot police used tear gas to disperse the 200-strong crowd.

Police estimated around 150,000 
people took part in the demonstration in Paris, but march organisers 
claimed on their Twitter account that more than a million people did.

Meanwhile, far-right demonstrators 
hung a banner on the ruling Socialist Party headquarters calling for 
President Francois Hollande to quit.

The
protests, which began as a campaign strongly backed by the Roman 
Catholic Church, have evolved into a wider movement with opposition 
politicians and far-right militants airing discontent with the unpopular
Hollande.

Although more than half of French people support the law allowing same-sex marriage and adoption -  and more than 70 per cent believe the protests should now stop - the mass rallies have contributed to Hollande’s low popularity ratings.

His administration has been plagued by economic recession and unemployment has now hit more than 10 per cent, but Hollande got some welcome news on Sunday, after his popularity inched up four points to 29 per cent this month.

Although it failed to block gay marriage, the protest movement hopes its show of force will delay or stop further laws allowing assisted procreation and surrogate motherhood for gay couples.

Interior Minister Manuel Valls mobilised 4,500 officers to police the event.

The situation escalated Tuesday when far-right writer Dominique Venner, who is linked to a far-right French nationalist party, shot and killed himself inside Paris’ Notre Dame Cathedral. He had called for 'spectacular' action to protect France’s identity, and was denouncing same-sex marriage law.

Hollande’s Socialist Party denounced the protest, highlighting the fact that the law has already passed in parliament and was validated by the Constitutional Council.

The conservative opposition UMP party was split over whether to continue the rallies.

The protest was called 'La Manif pour Tous' (Demonstration for All)

UMP President Jean-Francois Cope and several other party leaders joined the march and urged young protesters to join his party as a 'new UMP generation' and campaign against the left-wing government.

But several other UMP leaders, including former conservative prime ministers Francois Fillon and Alain Juppe, kept their distance, saying lawmakers should exercise their influence in parliament rather than march in street protests.

France’s first gay wedding is due to take place on Wednesday in Montpellier, France’s self-proclaimed capital of gay culture.

The protests have grown into a wider opposition movement against the unpopular President Hollande
