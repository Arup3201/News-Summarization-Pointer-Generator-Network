Prince Charles is famous for his love of plants but it seems the Queen loves flowers just as much as her eldest son. 

According to Alan Titchmarsh, the monarch adores her garden so much, she has a weekly posy cut and delivered to her on Monday mornings when she returns to Buckingham Palace from Windsor.

The half-dozen blooms are taken from the palace gardens and are a gift from her gardeners, who like to show off the latest fruits of their labours.

'She has a little posy cut for her every Monday, which is placed on her desk when she gets back from Windsor,' said Titchmarsh.

'It will typically have six or seven different types of flowers from the garden to give her a little snapshot of what's looking good at that time.'

Currently, that means honeysuckle, winter jasmine and blueberries, although the selection changes depending on the season. 

Titchmarsh made the revelations during an interview with the Radio Times to promote The Queen's Garden, a documentary about the Buckingham Palace grounds which is due to be screened on Christmas Day.

The veteran gardener was given unfettered access to the Palace gardens for a year and was allowed to place cameras in trees in order to chart its progress through the year.

The result is a rare snapshot of the Queen's 40-acre private gardens in all their glory - complete with 35 types of mulberry and a rare white helleborine orchid.

Also captured on the motion sensing cameras is the local wildlife, among them foxes and hedgehogs, although the monarch hardly features at all.

That, explains Titchmarsh, is because the royal gardeners are enormously protective of their employer.

'The gardeners are quite cagey [about] talking about what the Queen likes,' he says. 'But what becomes quite evident is she loves what we would call English cottage garden flowers - unostentatious flowers, not things that are too exotic.'

Not, however, that the Queen is shy of making her feelings on planting clear. 'If it's a quick replanting of a bed, they wouldn't bother her much with that,' says Tichmarsh. 'But she is very much involved with major changes. 

'The summer garden parties were always in July but now they have been moved earlier to June, that means adjusting the planting scheme to make the borders brighter earlier.

'She would be consulted about that sort of thing.'
