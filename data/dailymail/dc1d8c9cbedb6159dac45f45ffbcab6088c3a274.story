Prince George has been credited with a surge in popularity for real wool products as consumers flock to mimic his traditional dress.

The 15-month-old prince, who has been seen swaddled in a variety of traditional, cardigans, jumpers and blankets, is said to have sparked an increase in sales in some quarters of up to 400 per cent.

His grandfather, Prince Charles, who gave George a beautiful woolen jumper when he was born, will no doubt be delighted as the founder of this week’s national Campaign for Wool week.

The little prince - and his mother - have championed ‘heritage babywear’, resulting in one company’s website crashing thanks to unprecedented demand, while another sold out of its traditional woollen christening shawls.

Peter Ackroyd, the chief Operations Officer at the Campaign for Wool, said the ‘Prince George effect’ was a welcome addition to an across the board swing away from trendy ‘street’ baby wear to more old-fashioned children’s clothing.

‘It is wonderful that mothers are once again realising the great qualities of wool,’ he said. 'We are currently in the midst of Wool Week, a celebration of all things wool, and this is yet more good news to celebrate.'

George Austin of wool label Cable added: ‘Customers want what Prince George is wearing for their little ones.’

The young Prince had an almost immediate impact on the sales of wool when three days after he was born he appeared on the steps of the hospital wrapped in a £45 merino christening shawl by Nottingham-based GH Hurt & Son.

The company said that the phone was 'ringing off' the hook when the images appeared on the evening news.

Likewise, the achingly hip British-based fashion label Wool and the Gang have introduced a baby range to take advantage of a fourfold increase in demand for products in the natural fibre.

Ashleigh Tennent, Marketing & Customer Experience Director, said: 'At Wool and the Gang we've seen a massive surge in the popularity of wool and knitting, with sales up 440 per cent year on year for the past three months.

'We're now launching a new wool-based Mini Collection for ages 1-10 due to high customer demand, which is hand-knitted by our network of knitters or as an easy-to-follow Knit Kit.

'Wool has amazing qualities that makes it great for young children. It's breathable, stretchy, made to last, and is easy to care for. It's also naturally stain resistant, a good thing for little ones!'

Fan: Prince Charles - and the Duchess of Cornwall - are both fans of woollen ensembles

When he was eight months old Prince George sparked a demand for cream jumpers and cardigans when he arrived in one during the Royal Tour of New Zealand.

As a result, wool label Cable saw a surge in demand for similar products - something that designer Austin says has continued.

'[Parents] have seen the Prince cuddled up in his mother’s arms on the tarmac in the knit and they want the same for their little one,' he said.

During the same tour, Debenhams reported a 62 per cent spike in traditional styles of baby boys’ clothing.

Demand: Thanks to George, demand for wool products has shot up and sales now total more than £300 million

The demand for romper suits and cardigans in traditional cotton and wool fabrics was particularly strong, they said.

The British wool industry, virtually on the brink of extinction five years ago, has seen a remarkable resurgence since Prince Charles began the Campaign for Wool.

Currently celebrating its fifth anniversary with the annual Wool Week, the industry has grown by 70 per cent in the last three years to record sales of more than £300m.

It now employs more than 8,000 people in 40 mills and most of its production is exported.
