Victim: Jo Hamilton, 56, pleaded guilty to fraud as she feared going to jail

Dozens of men and women running small post offices may have been wrongly taken to court and even jailed over losses caused by a faulty computer system, it has been claimed.

Sub-postmasters have been prosecuted or forced to hand over their life savings after being blamed for ‘losses’ identified by a computer system.

One of these, postmistress Jo Hamilton, 56, was charged with false accounting of £36,000 when a Post Office audit showed a shortfall at her sub-post office in her shop in South Warnborough, South Hampshire.

They claim to be baffled by the discrepancies – sometimes running into many thousands of pounds – between what the computer claimed they should have in their tills and their actual takings for the day.

But for years, they say, bosses refused to listen, denying anything was wrong with the IT system, and were ruthless in calling in police.

At least three sub-postmasters have been jailed over the losses, while dozens of others have had to remortgage their homes or give their life savings to the Post Office to avoid prosecution.

But last month an independent  review, ordered following pressure by MPs, revealed ‘defects’ and training failures in the system used to record all transactions in 11,500 branches nationwide.

Following the publication of the critical report, the company has suddenly dropped three separate prosecutions over the last two weeks.

Next week the Post Office will announce a review into the cases, and is expected to start talks on possible compensation for those wrongly accused. Some 130 sub-postmasters have lodged formal complaints.

Lawyers say the losses amount to millions and that the Post Office could be inundated with claims.

Ian Bates, who is negotiating with the company on behalf of the postmasters, said their treatment had been ‘scandalous’.

‘This has ruined people’s lives,’ he said. ‘No one has had the resources to take on the Post Office. I hope now the truth will come out and justice can be done.’

The problems began to emerge after the Horizon IT system was introduced in 2000.

Sub-postmasters began to report that their systems were indicating losses which did not reflect the true amounts of money they had taken during the day.

But for years bosses flatly denied there were problems with the system, and sub-postmasters were simply ordered to pay the money back.

The situation was made worse by ‘outdated contracts’ which many sub-postmasters were on, which stated that they had to make up any losses themselves.

One of those affected was Noel Thomas, 66, a father of three who had devoted his entire working life to the Post Office.

He was jailed and made bankrupt after investigators ruled that £48,000 had gone missing from the branch he ran in Gaerwen on Anglesey.

Mr Thomas, who joined the Royal Mail at 18, said he had repeatedly raised concerns with bosses over failure to get his books to balance following the introduction of the Horizon system.

Rather than risking closing his business by declaring that his till did not balance, he signed off the accounts each week, in the hope that his pleas to superiors for help with the system would eventually lead to the problem being sorted out.

But when they sent in auditors, he was stunned to be arrested and accused of false accounting.

Jo Hamilton was one of the hundreds of sub-postmasters to have their contracts terminated by the Post Office over allegations of false accounting.

Mrs Hamilton, 56, ran  the sub-post office from  her shop in the Hampshire village of South Warnborough.

The respected businesswoman was prosecuted after a Post Office audit revealed a £36,000 shortfall at her branch. She insisted that she did not take the money and always  suspected the ‘unfathomable’ computer system was to blame.

After she was charged with false accounting in 2008, villagers raised £6,000 to help her pay back the cash. Mrs Hamilton and her husband David, 66, a landscape gardener, re-mortgaged their home to raise the £30,000 balance.  Sixty villagers and friends supported her in court.

Yesterday she said she pleaded guilty only because she was so fearful of going to prison if convicted.

Mrs Hamilton said the Post Office had also offered to drop a theft allegation if she admitted false accounting and paid the ‘missing’ cash back.

The mother of two, who still runs her shop, added: ‘I’m sure I will get justice in the end.’

Mr Thomas was jailed for nine months in December 2006 for false accounting, and served 13 weeks before he was released with an electronic tag.

Like several of his colleagues, he admitted that he had  technically committed false accounting offences by making false declarations, because he was unable to explain the shortfalls highlighted by the Horizon system, but he insisted he had never taken any money.

‘Signing off the accounts was where I made a mistake,’ he now admits.

‘But if I didn’t do that, I wouldn’t be opening the next morning. I lost my business and my good name. I lost everything.’

Jacqueline McDonald from Broughton, Lancashire, was jailed for 18 months at Preston Crown Court in 2011 for theft and false accounting relating to £94,000 of ‘missing’ cash.

The mother of three admitted putting false figures in the system when the tills did not balance, but says she ‘did not steal one penny’ and is now pursuing a civil claim against the Post Office.

Last month’s independent review of the Horizon system, carried out by private firm Second Sight, highlighted ‘defects’ or ‘bugs’ in the software that affected 76 branches.

It also identified training failures and said the Post Office had been ‘inadequate’ in supporting sub-postmasters to use the system.

Following the publication of the report, three prosecutions which were due to take place this month have been quietly dropped by the Post Office.

These include the case of Susan Knight, 58, who ran St Keverne sub-post office in Cornwall. She was accused of false accounting involving £22,500. Her contract was terminated and she handed over more than £20,000 to make up the alleged shortfall by using her life savings and borrowing money.

A Post Office spokesman confirmed a working group had been set up to ‘review outstanding cases’. Commenting on the dropped prosecutions, she said: ‘A decision has been made that it is not in the public interest to prosecute.’
