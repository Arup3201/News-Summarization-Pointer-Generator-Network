The wife of a company executive whose body washed up on a Florida beach last year placed a bouquet of flowers on Monday at the spot where he was found as his family continue to seek answers over his mysterious death.

Jay Harper, 47, of Southbury, 
Connecticut, disappeared last October, during a corporate conference at 
the Embassy Suites hotel in Deerfield Beach.

The father-of-three's body was 
discovered at around 4am on October 17 on the stretch of beach directly 
in front of the hotel. His cause of death is unknown but police are investigating the fatality as a homicide.

His family visited the Florida town to hand out flyers in the hope that someone will remember something about the night that the father-of-three was found dead.

The Harper family have offered a $5,000 reward and Broward's County crimestoppers added a further $3,000.

His widow Karen Harper told NBC: 'We're not going to forget this we're not going to let this go. We want to know what happened to my husband.'

On October 17, 2012, Mr Harper booked a room at the Embassy Suites to attend his work event. He had some drinks at the hotel bar and was seen speaking to a woman. 

When a deputy sheriff approached her, she told him that her friend went for a walk on the beach but no one could be seen. 

According to Broward County Sheriff's
Office, Mr Harper's body washed ashore and 
was found about 4am on Wednesday by a deputy patrolling the beach on an 
ATV, just south of the city's International Fishing Pier.

The woman is not considered a suspect but her purse was stolen, something that the police are investigating.

Mr Harper was father to two sons and a daughter. His death last year on a Florida beach has been left unexplained

Colleagues at Coverall Health-based Cleaning System, where Mr Harper was a regional vice-president expressed their shock at his death last year.

Mark Searcy said that his boss had had a 'good day' at the work event and enjoyed a team dinner the night he went missing.

'We all had dinner together last night,' he wrote. 'Woke up to the news that he was found washed up on the beach. He was 47. Left behind a wife and 3 children. He had a good day yesterday before tragedy.

'No one is guaranteed tomorrow, hug your loved ones a little closer tonight. Tell them that you love them daily.'
