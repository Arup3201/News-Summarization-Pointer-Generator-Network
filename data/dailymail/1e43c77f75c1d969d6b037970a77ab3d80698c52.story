'Moral panic' about the internet among middle class parents is stunting children's development, a leading psychologist has warned.

Professor Tanya Byron believes that unless parents let their children explore and make mistakes - both in the real-world and online - they will never become 'digitally responsible'.

However, she added that managing these risks, and guiding children through them, is ultimately the responsibility of the adults in their lives, both at home and school.

Speaking at a teacher conference in Birmingham, Professor Byron expressed concerns about the ‘moral panic’ that surrounds young people and the web.

She said: ‘The moral panic is unhelpful. Awareness without life experience can sometimes be challenging – so it’s our responsibility to bridge that gap.’

‘We need to accept that kids are going to take risks online so that we can guide them, just as our parents did when we were allowed to ride our bikes.’

Two-thirds of parents in a recent Co-operative Childcare survey said their children spent significantly less time outside than the parents did.

Eight in ten said their own favourite activities as children involved being outdoors, but only half their children lead the same active life.

British adults said they loved playing ball games, skipping and other traditional outdoor activities.

But their children prefer to get their kicks from a screen, by playing computer games, surfing the internet or watching TV.

Some 36 per cent of today’s children get their entertainment from a screen, compared with just 8 per cent in the Eighties.

As well as safety fears and a lack of time, parents said they simply agreed to their children’s less active preferences.

Professor
 Byron continued that because of the internet, children are already 
‘incredibly aware’, but many adults are so ‘illiterate when it comes to 
understanding technology’ that its creating an environment of fear.

She
 added there’s a ‘perverse irony’ - especially among the middle classes -
 where parents are not letting their children go out and play, or walk 
to school alone, but are giving them numerous gadgets, and access to the
 internet. 

They then have access to a global community, and in some cases more dangers, risks and harmful images than they would on the streets, but parents aren’t talking to them about any of it in advance.

‘We need to empower them and focus on making them emotionally resilient digitally as well as being emotionally resilient offline.
