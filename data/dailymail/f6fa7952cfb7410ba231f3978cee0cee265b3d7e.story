The obesity crisis in the US could be solved if they lifted the ban on importing haggis, a leading medic has claimed.

Former surgeon Lord McColl claimed 24million American Scots were missing out on the delicacy, which 'satisfies hunger very much more than the junk food Americans consume'.

But ministers warned the best chance of securing agreement to sell haggis in the US was to get manufacturers to stop including sheep lungs.

The House of Lords heard claims that the obesity crisis in the US could be solved if they lifted the ban on importing haggis

The consumption of sheep lung, a key ingredient of haggis alongside heart and liver, has been banned in the US since 1971 and all British lamb has been banned since 1989 following the BSE crisis.

The haggis market is already said to be worth £15million in the UK and supporters argue it could be worth far more in the US, given the popularity of Scottish heritage in the country.

Lord McColl, a Tory peer, said there could be health benefits for the US if haggis was on the menu.

The former professor and director of surgery at Guy's Hospital, London, told peers: 'The United States government is depriving 24 million American Scots of this wholesome food which satisfies hunger very much more than the junk food Americans consume.

'This would help to deal with the greatest epidemic they have - the obesity epidemic, which is killing millions, costing billions of dollars and the cure is free.'

However, Lord Winston, a leading fertility doctor and television presenter, hit back, saying that haggis was 'revolting' but if it could be used to curb obesity it should be promoted in Glasgow first.

The Labour peer said: 'I confess to being a little bit surprised that one of the most senior qualified medical practitioners in the chamber is asking this question seeing there is a questionable issue about haggis, which I find personally a revolting food.

'Would charity be better at home and if it does really deal with obesity maybe we should be promoting it a little bit in Glasgow?'

The Government hopes the ban on British lamb can be lifted as part of a European Union-US trade deal currently being negotiated, which is potentially worth more than £10bn to the British economy overall. Food minister minister Lord de Mauley said there were two obstaclkes to exporting haggis.

'First, the US restrictions on the import of lamb. We are working with the US authorities towards achieving approval to lift those restrictions with I think good prospects,' he said.

'Secondly the US's unwillingness to recognise animal lungs as an acceptable food stuff. In this regard the most promising avenue in the short term is the production of haggis omitting the inclusion of lung and the Scottish government recognises this.'

Former environment secretary Owen Paterson had lobbied the US authorities during a visit last summer.

Lib Dem Lord Purvis of Tweed urged David Cameron to raise the issue during talks with Barack Obama in the White House today.

He demanded that 'this ridiculous ban comes to an end', adding: 'If it is not too late, I see that the Prime Minister is with President Obama today, so can my noble friend send an urgent message to make sure that this visit is a triumph by having a private word with the President to make sure that the ban is now lifted'

Lord De Mauley replied: 'Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee a rapid resolution of the problem, but I hope I have made clear that we are working extremely hard towards it. Promoting food and drink exports more generally is a key government priority. 

'We are working hard to champion UK food and drink overseas with, I think, considerable success.' 

SNP MP Pete Wishart said: 'If Robert Burns was around today, no doubt he'd brand Lord Winston a 'sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie' for this affront tae a haggis.

'What's really revolting is the millions of pounds of taxpayers' money spent funding the bloated House of Lords year on year which seems to serve little purpose other than to allow unelected peers to insult our national dish.'
