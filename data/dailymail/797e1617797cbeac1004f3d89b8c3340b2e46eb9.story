A model and fashion blogger who was horrifically injured after walking into a spinning plane propeller has taken her first steps after the accident.

A post on Lauren Scruggs' Caring Bridge website reveals she had managed 30 steps five days after she inadvertently walked into the propeller at a private airport in Dallas, Texas.

The 23-year-old suffered a skull fracture, brain injury, severed left hand and could still lose her left eye in the horrific incident.

On Monday, she made a further step in her recovery after speaking for the first time.

Under the headline 'Lauren walks!', a post from yesterday reads: 'This morning... the physical therapist assisted Lauren walking for the first time.

'Once she got halfway there, she said "30". Not sure what she meant, [her family] asked her what that means, she replied "steps!"

'What a praise, she was counting every step she took!'

But the model faces a long period of recovery as she has already undergone several emergency surgeries on her face and shoulder.

The update added: 'The left eye is still non-responsive, the doctors will continue monitoring it for the next few days.

'Please pray [for] Lauren as she begins to learn the extent of her injuries.'

She is believed to have been returning to the two-seater plane to thank the pilot when she accidentally walked into the propeller.

Her father Jeff told Good Morning America: 'They're telling us it's going to be a long recovery. Obviously she's had a lot of trauma to her head, and she lost her left hand and her left eye is questionable.

'We're praying she'll regain her sight.'

Mother Cheryl was overcome with emotion as she recounted the ordeal.

She said: 'I was inside, and someone came in and told me she had gotten hit. I was there until the care flight got there.

'I was just able to hold her andâ€¦ that's the toughest part of it all, just seeing her waiting there and waiting for the help. All I could do was tell her that I love her.'

Family friend Janee Harrell said: 'They landed and Lauren was getting off the plane so they could pick up another passenger. It was dark... we are thinking that Lauren came back to thank the pilot, and didn't see that the propeller was winding down.'

Miss Scruggs, who created her own style website, suffered the freak accident as she climbed out of the plane at Aero County Airport in McKinney, Texas, after a flight to see Christmas lights across the state on Saturday.

According to RadarOnline, Lynn Lunsford, Mid-States Public Affairs Manager with the Federal Aviation Administration,said that an integral part of the investigation into exactly what happened is why the propeller was still moving when Miss Scruggs got off the plane.

'It appears that the pilot left the engine running at idle while she exited the plane to switch places with another passenger. That's one of the aspects of the investigation,' he told RadarOnline.

The pilot has not yet been identified but he is thought to have been a friend of Lauren's and recently purchased the plane.

Ms Scruggs, from the suburban area of Plano in Dallas, was taken to the Parkland Memorial Hospital where her devout Christian family, including her mother Cheryl, father Jeff and twin sister Brittany, gathered at her bedside.

Miss Scruggs worked in the wardrobe department of the TV show Gossip Girl. She is also the editor of an online fashion magazine Lolo.com, which she started four months ago, and recently interviewed Twilight star Kellan Lutz at New York Fashion Week.
