Tragic: Lorraine Douglas, 51, suffered a severe head injury in a fall at home which left her on a life-support machine

A family suffered the heartbreak of having to say goodbye to a mother every day for 20 days after she lived for three weeks after her life-support machine was turned off.

Lorraine Douglas, 51, had suffered a severe brain injury after falling down the stairs at home, from which she could never recover.

After spending two days in intensive care, doctors informed the family they could do nothing more for Ms Douglas.

The family made the decision to turn off her life-support machine and prepared to say their goodbyes.

But she survived for a further three weeks, causing agony for her family who stayed at her bedside as they expected her to pass away at any moment.

Her daughter Leeanne, 22, said: 'I must have said my last goodbye to my mum a hundred times during those three weeks. 

'I was constantly saying goodbye, thinking every time I did would be the last chance I got to say it to her.

'Our lives stopped for three weeks. But at least we got to say all the things to Mum that we wanted to before she went.'

There was even a moment when Ms Douglas opened her eyes, giving her family false hope she might recover.

Her brother Brain Keddie, 48, said: 'It was horrendous. We had said our final goodbyes, we had prepared to let Lorraine go, and then nothing happened.

'She lay there for three more weeks, with us three at her side, knowing there was nothing we could do for her.

'There were some point when we thought maybe, just maybe she’ll get 
better. But I think we all really knew the truth. It was unbearable.'

Ms Douglas, a childcare worker, had been found unconscious by her daughter at her home in Wellhouse, Glasgow, who had looked through the letterbox and seen her lying at the bottom of the stairs.

She said: 'I couldn’t unlock the front door, as Mum’s keys were in the lock. So I phoned her mobile and could hear it ringing on the other side of the door.

'I looked through the letterbox and saw her lying there at the bottom of
the stairs. Her dog Archie was sitting at her side. It was awful.'

She phoned the emergency services who took her mother to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, from where she was transferred to the Southern General's Intensive Care Unit.

Ms Douglas's 76-year-old mother Margaret Keddie was also at her side with Mr Keddie and Miss Douglas during the three week vigil.

As she carried an organ donor card, arrangements had been made to donate her kidneys, but the donation was not possible because of the prolonged nature of her death.

Mr Keddie said: 'Plans had been made to donate Lorraine’s kidneys and a positive match had even been found.

'The doctors, like us, had expected Lorraine to pass away straight away - not three weeks later.

'But there was only a small time window, around three hours, between Lorraine dying and the organs being donated.

'So because of what happened, organ donation was no longer possible. We thought at least something good could come out Lorraine’s death.

'But she was denied her last wish - to help someone else. It was yet another devastating blow for us.'

Ms Douglas passed away on Tuesday with her family by her side, 22 days after her fall.
