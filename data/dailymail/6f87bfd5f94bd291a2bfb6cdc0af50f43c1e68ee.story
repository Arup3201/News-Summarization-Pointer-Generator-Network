The White House, along with every other cog in the U.S. intelligence machinery, snapped to attention on Friday when the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) announced that a Jordanian airstrike had killed a female American hostage. 

'We're obviously deeply concerned by those reports,' White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz told reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, en route to a presidential speech in Indianapolis, Indiana.

'We have not at this time seen any indication to corroborate those claims, but that's all we have right now.'

Tragic: Kayla Jean Mueller, 26, is understood to be the last U.S. hostage held by the IIS terror army, which had been demanding $6.6 million for her release

Rubble: ISIS claims Mueller was inside this building and was killed by a Jordanian airstrike; the group added that none of its militants had been injured during the raid

Schultz noted at the time that ISIS's claim was 'a few old,' adding that 'our intelligence community is looking into them.'

He acknowledged that the U.S. was working with Jordan's king to hammer ISIS positions, partially in retaliation for the grisly burning death of a Jordanian Air Force pilot this week.

The hostage, 26-year-old Kayla Jean Mueller, is a Prescott, Arizona native who devoted her young adulthood to charity work in Syria.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz had few facts to share on Friday about Kayla Jean Mueller's fate, but said the Obama administration is 'deeply concerned' about reports that she had been killed

She volunteered for three years with the Save Darfur Coalition, battling genocide in the war-torn African region.

While the White House scrambles to determine if Mueller is still alive, Jordanian Interior Minister Hussein Majali seems certain that ISIS is hoaxing the world. 

'They tried to cause problems internally in Jordan and haven't succeeded,' Majali told CNN on Friday. 'They are now trying to drive a wedge between the coalition with this latest low PR stunt.' 

Schultz told reporters that 'the United States of America spares no effort to secure the safe release of any American held overseas.'

'That includes exhausting military options, intelligence resources, diplomatic channels, obviously the financial stranglehold we put on ISIL.

'ISIL' is the White House's preferred alternative acronym for ISIS.  

U.S. National Security Council spokesperson Bernadette Meehan said Friday that the White House has 'not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates' ISIS's version of events.

'We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,' she said.
