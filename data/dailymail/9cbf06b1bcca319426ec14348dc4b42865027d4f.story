Popular landlord George Wilson, 41, was stabbed to death outside the Fox & Hounds in Nottingham 50 years ago

Detectives are asking the public to help them solve the unresolved murder of a landlord who was stabbed to death outside his pub five decades ago.

The bloodied body of George Wilson, 41, was found yards from the front door of the Fox and Grapes pub in Nottingham minutes after he took his dog for a late-night walk in the early hours of September 8 ,1963.

The unsolved case - know has the Pretty Windows Murder because of the pub's attractive frontage - led to five confessions, but all of them were deemed fake by police.

Mr Wilson, who had a six-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son, had been stabbed 13 times with a six-inch Bowie knife but no money had been taken from his wallet, which suggested to police that his murder was personal rather than random.

His wife Alberta found him lying in the street after she heard their mongrel Blackie scratching at the door and saw the dog was covered in blood.

Post mortem tests revealed the popular landlord had been stabbed in the base of the skull, face and back.

The murder weapon was found by two young boys nine days later in a ditch, and traces of Mr Wilson’s blood were found on the sheath and the blade which was bent at the tip.

However, his killer has never been caught.

Now Nottinghamshire Police have reopened their investigation into what became known as the 'Pretty Windows Murder' in reference to the intricate pattern on the pub's windows.

Mr Wilson's widow died in 1997 without knowing the motive for his death, and their daughter Margaret, 56, has now joined police in the hunt for the killer.

Speaking ahead of the 50th anniversary of her father's death, she said: 'Whoever did this robbed us of our dad.

'We would really like to know for our own peace of mind, even if the offender is dead.'

She said her family realised later that her father was wearing a suit on the night of his death, as if he had been planning to go somewhere or meet someone.

She added: 'We think that quite a lot of local people will have known something about Dad’s death., as everyone knew each other’s business back then.

'We are also pretty sure that Blackie would have attacked whoever attacked Dad; he was very protective of him.

'Our mother died in 1997, without ever knowing who did this or why.  No motive has ever been established.'

Two months before the murder, Mr Wilson received an anonymous death threat, but police couldn't identify anyone with a grudge against him.

Pieces of broken slate from a nearby low roof suggested that the killer had jumped down before the attack and five people even confessed to the killing.

But not one of them could describe the murder weapon or identify the victim from pictures.

One of those who confessed was a Dartmoor prisoner who said he got into an argument with George when the landlord made a few jokes at the expense of Nottingham Forest in their game that day with Wolverhampton Wanderers.

One witness described a man running down Longden Street at 12.50am wearing a green Robin Hood style hat, a light-coloured raincoat and appeared to have a knife or chisel in his hand.

But the trail went cold after that discovery, despite the biggest manhunt in Nottinghamshire Police’s history.

Today police relaunched the case and released a picture of former miner Mr and Mrs Wilson on their wedding day.

DCI Tony Heydon said: 'Over the years we have had people calling in with information in relation to George’s murder, but we are still keen to hear from anyone who hasn’t come forward before.

'Those who have previously spoken to the police if they wish to corroborate their accounts or anyone out there who has information which they may previously have thought to be of little relevance is also asked to contact us.

'I would also be keen to hear from anyone who was in the local licensing industry in the 60s, other landlords, or even older residents who still live in the area.'

He added: 'People do change alliances, and it may be someone you knew many years ago arrived home on 8 September 1963 acting out of character or even gave you information about what had happened.

'We need to hear from you, and I would urge you to contact us.  50 years have passed but for George’s children, Margaret and David, so many questions remain unanswered.

'Cases such as this never close and we remain determined to get justice for George’s family.'
