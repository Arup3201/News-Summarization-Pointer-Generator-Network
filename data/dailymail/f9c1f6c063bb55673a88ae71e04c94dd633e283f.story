It's a minor misdemeanour that lands millions of men across the world in trouble with their wives.

But help could finally be here for those who miss the mark and wet the toilet seat while relieving themselves, thanks to a Chinese invention.

The Pee Straight contraption is effectively a standard funnel attached to a 10 inch pipe designed to help both men and women with their aim.

Take aim: Two Chinese women sell the Pee Straight invention outside a public toilet in the city of Shenzhen

Bemused: This man seems amused by the saleswoman's attempts to convince him to invest in one of the inventions

The device was invented by Shenzhen entrepreneur Ma Xianqing in response to a civic crackdown on those who can't aim properly.

As part of the Shenzhen City Public Toilet Management Act, those who make a mess in a public toilet could be hit with a $15 fine by sanitation managers if caught.

The law also punishes anyone who is found grafittiing, smoking or littering public loos.

As well as helping to keep Shenzhen's toilets sparkling, the inventor also claims that the Pee Straight affords its user a degree of privacy while at the urinal.

The device comes in male and female versions, with the women's having a shorter pipe.

Handy: The devices have been introduced in the wake of a new law that could see residents of the city fined $15 if they make a mess while relieving themselves

According to NBC News, city officials wouldn't comment on whether on not anyone had been fined under the new law.

While many took to social networking sites in China to ridicule both the new law and the subsequent invention, others were clearly impressed.

One user urged the inventor to have the device patented as soon as possible on Weibo, China's answer to Twitter.

Shenzhen was recently declared the world's most unfriendly city by Conde Nast Traveller magazine.
