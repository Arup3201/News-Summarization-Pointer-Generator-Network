Stray black cats take 40 per cent longer than others to rehome because superstitious people associate them with witchcraft, an animal charity has claimed.

Cats Protection, which has 29 adoption centres in the UK, rescues and rehomes 230,000 stray cats every year.

But the charity finds it much harder to find new owners for black cats than for felines of other colours.

Unlucky: Stray black cats take 40 per cent longer than others to rehome, the Cats Protection charity has claimed

Mark Campbell-Blake, treasurer of the charity's Crawley, Reigate and District branch, said: 'The problem is around superstition.

'Black cats are no less loving than any other cats we have here, but for some reason people always go for the patterned cat.

'Unfortunately people don't want to go for a black cat.'

In the Middle Ages, people with black cats were thought to be witches, who used the cat - called a familiar - to help them cast spells.

But in more recent times, black cats have been seen as unlucky if they cross your path from right to left.

If they cross in the other direction - from left to right - they are considered lucky.

Mr Campbell-Blake told the Get Surrey website that, of the 402 cats rehomed by his branch last year, 190 were black.

It took 40 per cent longer on average for a new owner to be found for a black cat, he added.

He said: 'The longer they are with us in care, the more it costs us as a charity and the less money we have to spend on other cats.'

A poll of 1,000 people for Cats Protection found that 60 per cent of those questioned said they did not want a black cat.

The charity is to raise awareness of the problem next month when it holds Black Cat dinner dance and charity auction.
