Richie Benaud is set to make his broadcasting return a year after a serious car crash.

The 84-year-old former Australia captain, revered throughout cricket and one of the sport's best-loved commentators, sustained shoulder and chest injuries when he lost control of his vehicle in October last year.

He is now set for a tentative comeback on Australian network Channel Nine, with the possibility of further appearances during a busy 2015 schedule.

Nine's head of sport Steve Crawley told Fairfax Media: 'Richie is coming in to work to voice a teaser for the first Twenty20 (against South Africa) next week. 

'That is the first bit of work Richie has done in more than a year since his car accident.

'He is good. In his words, he is moving along slowly but happily. It will be lovely to have him launching our summer of cricket next week.'
