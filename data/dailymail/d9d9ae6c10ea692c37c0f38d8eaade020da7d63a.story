Senegal boss Alain Giresse is expected to become the first managerial casualty of the Africa Cup of Nations after his side were eliminated on Tuesday, according to Senegalese news agency APS.

A 2-0 defeat against Algeria ensured Senegal missed out on a quarter-final berth, and when talking to reporters after the game Giresse had already seemed to accept his fate.

Giresse told reporters after the game: 'The road has ended, my contract is at an end.

'There will be a lot of changes around the national team. What will be next? I do not know.'

The 62-year-old was roundly criticised over his tactics by Senegalese football personalities in their post-tournament exit analysis on Wednesday.

The diminutive former French international was competing at his third Nations Cup, having taken Mali to the third place at the 2012 finals and Gabon to the group stages two years earlier.
