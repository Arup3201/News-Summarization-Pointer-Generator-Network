These pictures show the wedding of a pair of drug addicts who beat their addiction at a rehabilitation centre on the outskirts of Kabul.

Bride Sousan and groom Ali got married at the 'Mother Camp' rehabilitation centre for drug addicts on Friday.

Sousan, a widow and mother of three, and Ali overcame their drug problems at the clinic, which is run by Iranian Laila Haidari.

Redemption: The ceremony took place at 'Mother Camp' rehabilitation centre for drug addicts. It was set up by Iranian documentary maker Laila Haidari

Taboo: Although drug use among women in Afghanistan is rampant, it is almost never talked about in the ultra-conservative nation

Haidari, a former documentary maker known as 'mother', runs a restaurant called Taj Begum, meaning 'Woman's Crown', and runs the shelter using the proceeds.

She also employs addicts to provide them with a chance to rebuild their lives and learn new skills while helping her run the business.

Treatment options for addicts in Afghanistan vary from the non-existent to limited. There is just one methadone substitution project, despite there being over one million users, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

There is also such a heavy stigma attached to drug addiction in ultra-conservative Afghanistan that drug use by females is almost never even mentioned.

Opium production in Afghanistan has been on the rise since the U.S. occupation started in 2001.

Both Sousan and Ali were addicted to opium. According to reports, around a million Afghans are addicted to drugs

The 'Mother Camp' rehabilitation centre is funded with the proceeds of a restaurant run by Haididi

Based on UNODC data, more land is now used for opium in Afghanistan than for growing cocoa in Latin America.

Earlier today a gunman wearing an Afghan army uniform on Sunday shot and killed a member of the U.S.-led coalition forces fighting in Afghanistan - the latest in a spate of insider attacks that are fracturing the trust between NATO and Afghan forces.

Separately, officials said 11 Afghan civilians were killed by land mines on Sunday in explosions in the east and south.

Mohammad Zarak, spokesman for the governor of Helmand province, said the shooting took place in Nad Ali district after an argument between an Afghan soldier and coalition service members. His identity and nationality were not disclosed.

Coalition figures show at least 60 coalition service members have been killed so far this year and others have been wounded in about 45 insider attacks, where members of the Afghan security forces or insurgents dressed in their uniforms turn their guns on U.S. and allied troops.
