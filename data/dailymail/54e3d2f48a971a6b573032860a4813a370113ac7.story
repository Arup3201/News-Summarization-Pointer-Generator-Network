Cristiano Ronaldo is no stranger to attracting attention, and the Real Madrid star was turning heads again this week as he was filmed driving a white Rolls-Royce.

The world's best player was seen arriving at the club's training ground in the pristine Rolls-Royce Phantom on Monday as the squad prepared for their Champions League clash with Basle on Wednesday night.

Ronaldo drove past a group of eager autograph hunters as they waited by the entrance to the training complex.

A group of on-lookers dashed across the road to get a closer look at Ronaldo and his wheels.

The 29-year-old didn't stop for the adoring supporters, but a number of them made a dash across the road to catch another glimpse of the Portugal star as he drove off into the distance.

Ronaldo will have been keeping a close eye on Tuesday's Champions League fixtures as Barcelona forward Lionel Messi grabbed a hat-trick and broke Raul's goalscoring record.

Messi went into the game against Apoel Nicosia level with the Real Madrid legend on 71 goals, but by the time the Argentina international left Cyprus his goalscoring exploits were matched by no one.

Ronaldo currently sits third on the list, now four goals behind Messi, but will be looking to close that gap when he lines up against the Swiss champions on Wednesday.
