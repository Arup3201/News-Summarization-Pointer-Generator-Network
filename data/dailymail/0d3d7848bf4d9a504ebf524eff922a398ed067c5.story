This October it will be 12 years since 202 people, including 26 Britons, were killed by a terrorist attack in Bali.

Polly Brooks, 41, from Guildford, was the only survivor from her group of friends who were at the Sari night club when it was destroyed by bomb blasts.

Polly managed to pull herself out of the rubble but her husband Dan Miller, 31, and her best friend Annika Linden, 30, weren't as lucky.

Limbering up: Bali bomb survivor Polly Brooks will run the Royal Parks Half Marathon next Sunday 

Despite the injuries she sustained in the attack making it difficult for her to run, next weekend Polly will take part in the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon in London to raise money and awareness for a charity - Dan's Fund for Burns - which she set up in their memory.

Recalling the terrible events in 2002, Polly told MailOnline: 'I'm alive to this day because I didn't get knocked unconscious. 

'I was on the dance floor when there was a massive explosion above the noise of the disco. There was a short pause when everyone stood and asked "what was that?", then there was another explosion but this time there was a massive flash of yellow light. 

'I was lifted off my feet. It was like you see in films, I hit the floor and loads of stuff was falling on top of me. I had this moment of sheer terror where I thought "this is it, I'm dying". 

Loss: Polly's first husband, Dan Miller, died in the terrorist attack in 2002. She set up a charity - Dan's Fund for Burns - in his memory and will raise money for it through her half marathon

'Everything was black apart from the flames and I could hear people screaming. I was under the corrugated iron part of the roof and I was able to pull it off myself and run up and out. 

'A beam was crushing my right leg but I managed to pull it off by losing my trousers and shoe. I ran onto the roof in my halter neck top and all I could see was a wall of fire.

'I was on fire myself but I made a run for it and reached a cul-de-sac where some guys from a hotel there rushed to help me.' 

Polly remained in the cul-de-sac with the other shocked and injured survivors for some time as the night club had collapsed across the road, blocking them in. 

Describing the horrific scene, Polly said: 'It was awful, there was a guy next to me who had his legs blown off and was writing a letter home to his family. 

'People were trying not to scream and nobody knew what had happened. I was able to borrow a mobile phone and call my mum and told her I had lost everyone. 

'I asked her to call Annika and Dan's mum to find out if they had called.'

Running in their memory: It's 12 years this October since the bombing in Bali which killed 202 people

Survival: Polly managed to pull herself out of the burning building after the roof collapsed on top of her

Support: Polly with her parents Rosemary and Peter when she flew back to Britain after she spent six weeks in hospital being treated for 43 per cent burns

But no-one had heard from either of them and Polly feared the worst. But she would have to wait five days for confirmation that her husband of five weeks and best friend had died.  

She explained: 'It was chaos afterwards and everyone was sent to different hospitals because the ones in Bali couldn't cope. I was flown to Australia and I just kept hoping Dan and Annika had made it out like I had. 

'But I think I knew the truth in my heart, Annika had been right next to me on the dance floor but Dan had been closer to the blast.'  

Polly and Dan had married just five weeks before the attack. 

'I went from an absolute high of getting married to my whole world changing,' she said.

The pair had met in Bali two years earlier when Dan was on a rugby tour and Polly was on holiday with friends. Both were living in Hong Kong at the time and they kept their holiday romance going.

When they returned to Bali on the rugby tour the following year, Dan proposed.

As the Bali rugby tour had become something of a tradition for them, they decided to return again in 2002 just after they had married. 

In training: Polly has run 11 miles in preparation for the race but finds running difficult because of her scars

Polly said: 'We shouldn't have gone back to Bali but it was the same rugby tour. We thought "it's our place, we should go". It was bad decision as all hell broke lose and everything I knew went wrong.'

Although Polly made it out of the burning building alive, she suffered 43 per cent burns to her body. 

She said: 'I was in so much pain I cannot describe it. Imagine what it's like when you burn your finger on an iron, well 43 per cent of my body was burnt and the other half cut up to patch up the burnt bits.'

Her physical pain made it hard for her to grieve for her dead husband and friends initially.

She explains: 'It really hurt to cry. One of the nurse told me "you have to focus on yourself and getting better. Grief will come later, you have to dig deep and survive."'

She decided from her hospital bed in Australia that she wouldn't be able to return to the life she shared with Dan in Hong Kong.

She would instead go back to the UK and threw herself back into her work as a sales trader in London. She admits she kept herself busy to put off having to deal with her shock and grief. 

She said: 'I went into overdrive, setting charity up, getting well enough to go back to work. I wanted to keep myself so, so busy. If I kept myself busy I wouldn't have to deal with what happened. I couldn't cope with it so the answer was to keep busy and not think about it.'

She added: 'It might sound strange but I felt it was unfair that I had survived. The weight of distress and upset was so huge, I felt the others had got away lightly. They were gone and didn't have to deal with it.'

Eventually Polly realised she had to take a step back and process what she had been through. She resigned from her job and sought counselling from experts who had supported the survivors of the London 7/7 attacks.

'Someone told me, "you can't get your life back exactly how it was, you have to rebuild a new life". So I started looking forward,' Polly said.

New life: Polly is now married to Andy and he and their two children will cheer her on on Sunday

She added that with the support of her friends and family, she was able to accept what had happened and realise she couldn't change it.

Towards the end of her counselling, she met Andy Brooks through mutual friends and they fell in love.

They married and now have two children, a son, six, and daughter, four. 

Polly said: 'I am lucky to have met two amazing guys in my life. Andy had to take on the history of what happened to me and the charity is still a big part of my life and he's really supportive of that. He's never been jealous or never thought my scarring was an issue.'

Andy will take the children to cheer Polly on as she takes to the streets of London to run her first  (and she believes last!) half marathon next Sunday.

She's trained for the event by running up to 11 miles but she admits she hasn't got the running bug. 

'I hate running to be honest!' she said.' Because of my burns, the left hand side of my body is quite twisted and slightly shorter than the other side so I have been having physio every two to three weeks to combat that. After having two children, I also didn't realise my pelvis was out of place so I've also been having physio for that. 

'I don't suppose I will be doing another half marathon but I really wanted to do it because it falls on the 12th anniversary.'
