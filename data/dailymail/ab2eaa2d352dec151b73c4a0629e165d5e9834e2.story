A 13-year-old white girl was taken by Houston police Saturday from her two black, male guardians and placed in Child Protective Services without being given so much as a reason.

Landry Thompson was visiting the city from Tulsa, Oklahoma over the weekend with her dance in

structor  Emmanuel Hurd, 29, and her dance partner, 22-year-old Josiah Kelly,  when cops hauled her away and held her for 11 hours.

Landry's mother, Destiny, has accused the police officers of racial profiling. She said: Are you aware your daughter is with two black men?’ When I said ‘Yes, I’m aware of that,’ he called into questioning our parenting,”

After several phone calls from Destiny, police let the young blonde go.

‘They just pulled us out of the car. Put our hands behind our backs like we were criminals,’ Thompson’s instructor told KHOU.

They were in town to take dance classes and were stopped at a gas station to check their GPS for directions to the hotel at 3am on Sunday.

They had traveled from Tulsa to Houston to record a video with some hip-hop artists at Planet Funk Academy.

That's when police spotted the three and put them all in handcuffs and into the back of separate patrol cars.

Thompson dozed off and the next thing she knew she was being handcuffed.

‘It really scared me,’ said Landry.  ‘They were convinced I was a runaway and they put me in the back of a cop car and I was terrified.’

Thompson's parents say they understand why their daughter and her guardians were questioned, because they made an unlikely trio to be out so late at night.

However, aware of this fact they took significant precautions and packed a range of documents to prove all was above board.

The guardians had a letter signed by Thompson's parents, her insurance card, her original birth certificate and a sheet with numerous contact numbers on it.

The Thompson's then scanned their drivers' licenses and sent them to the police during the incident, but were still not immediately believed.

Hurd tried pleading with the police, but it was no use.

‘The officer asked me “who’s the girl?” and I said ”she’s my student…I told him I had a notarized letter from her parents stating that we have full guardianship over her while we’re here.’”

He says police ignored the explanation.

‘They still put handcuffs on me,’ Landry said.

'It really scared me,' said Landry, who was hauled away in cuffs and 'put our hands behind our backs like we were criminals,' said Hurd

On the phone with Child Protective Services, Destiny Thompson says she was told she’d have to come all the way to Houston to pick up her daughter.

‘I was horrified,’ said Thompson.  ‘She was with the people I wanted her to be with.  She was with people I trusted.  And now she was taken away from those people and in a shelter with people I didn’t know.’

Thompson was let go hours later, at 11.30am, and after her mother repeatedly called Child Protective Services.

Hurd and Kelly had followed Thompson to the CPS center but were told to leave the reception area and were forced to wait for six hours in their car until she was released.

By Monday, the dancers were planning to leave Houston.

They would do so without learning why Landry was taken from her guardians.

‘I would love an apology,’ said Destiny said. ‘They owe her an apology.’

In a statement, the Houston Police Department defended the actions of their officers, claiming they had exercised appropriate 'caution'.

It read: 'Given the age discrepancies...and the child had no relatives in the area, officers in an abundance of caution, did their utmost to ensure her safety and sent her to CPS.'

Hurd and Kelly are considering taking legal action.

'I was horrified': Landry's mother Destiny says she had to call repeatedly to get her daughter turned over to her guardians and that she was initially told she'd have to fly to Houston to get her out of custody
