Everton manager Roberto Martinez has praised chairman Bill Kenwright for providing him with a strong enough squad to compete in the Premier League and Europe.

Martinez's side face Lille in Europa League Group H on Thursday night knowing victory would virtually guarantee qualificiation for the knockout stages.

And the confident Spaniard says he could make up to six changes without weakening the strength of his line-up even without the injured Antolin Alcaraz, Arouna Kone, John Stones, Bryan Oviedo and Kevin Mirallas.

'We showed by beating Aston Villa then getting a draw in Lille that we can make changes and perform in a manner to get results.

'At the start of the season, the chairman (Kenwright) and chief executive made sure we had a big enough squad to play Thursday-Sunday.

'We have 23 outfield players who have shown what they can do for the team. I don't see a weakened side by making four, five or six changes.

'To become a big club with the right mentality, we need to make changes. You always want to win the next game, as simple as that.'

Everton have collected five points from their three European games so far to top the group.

Antolin Alcaraz's shoulder injury sustained on Saturday will keep him out between six and 12 weeks with 36-year-old Sylvain Distin expected to replace him.

'We lost Antolin at the weekend,' Martinez said. 'He has dislocated his AC joint on his shoulder and will be out for a while.'

Martinez said Alcaraz's length of time on the sidelines would be determined by whether or not he will need to undergo surgery.

Defender Antolin Alcaraz could be out for up to 12 weeks after dislocating the AC joint in his right shoulder

'With Antolin it is difficult because the decision now is if he needs surgery or not,' Martinez added.

'It is a decision we are going to measure well and make the right call. It would depend - between six and 12 weeks, depending on the route we are taking.'

Full-backs Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman will play. '100 per cent, they are the best pair of full-backs in England,' smiled Martinez.

'In previous years, full-backs only had to defend – it was a bonus if they crossed the halfway line. But now they have to be able to defend one-on-one, and help offensively too.'
