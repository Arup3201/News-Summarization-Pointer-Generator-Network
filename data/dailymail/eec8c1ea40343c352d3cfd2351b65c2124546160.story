Controversy: Rolling Stone faced backlash for putting Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on its cover - but sales are up

Rolling Stone's controversial 'Boston Bomber' cover doubled the magazine's monthly sales despite the fact it sparked an intense backlash that saw it pulled from mammoth retailers like CVS and Stop & Stop.

According to newly released figures, news stand sales of the August issue, which had Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's face splashed dreamily across the cover, jumped 102 per cent over average per-issue sales for the past year.

Nearly 1500 retailers sold some 13,232 copies of the 'Boston Bomber' issue from July 19 to July 29, despite a 'Boycott Rolling Stone' campaign on Facebook and politicians weighing in to slam the magazine's editor.

Critics accused Rolling Stone of being insensitive and glorifying a notorious criminal in a way usually reserved for rock stars. The 19-year-old appeared in the photo with boyish good-looks and tussled curls.Â 

The photo was a self-portrait by Tsarnaev and had previously appeared on the cover of the May 5 edition of The New York Times, with distinctly less furor.

According to Ad Week, the boycott campaign was never going to have a huge impact on the magazine's overall bottom line as only 5 per cent of Rolling Stone's total circulation comes from retail sales. But the out-performance, does signify how controversy, and the attention it garners, usually only helps rather than hinders magazine issues flying off the stands.

When it was released at the start of the month, Boston officials and victims lambasted the magazine for celebrating the suspect and ignoring the victims, and retailers, including CVS and Walgreens, pulled the edition from its shelves.

But a circulation source told the New York Post on July 24, that sales for the issue were already running 20 per cent above the normal rate by the first weekend.

Rolling
Stone usually sells around 81,000 copies, but the estimated 
sell-through at that stage was already believed to be at least 90,000 
copies, the source said. A Rolling Stone spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures.

The
cover identifies the terrorist suspect simply as 'The Bomber'. The 
article promises to explain 'how a popular, promising student was failed
by his family, fell into radical Islam, and became a monster'.

The cover of Rolling Stone is 
typically occupied by rock stars and actors, and many felt the choice 
glorified Tsarnaev, who is accused of killing four people and wounding 
more than 260.

Boston Mayor Thomas Menino described the
cover as a 'total disgrace' and said it should have put survivors or 
first responders on the cover.

No apology: Rolling Stone Publisher Jann Wenner, pictured last week, refused to apologize and said the cover of the August edition was consistent with their history of serious journalism

'Why are we glorifying a guy who created
mayhem in the city of Boston?' Menino asked

'Why would we want to heroize this guy? 
He's a terrorist. We don't want him in our neighborhoods. We don't want 
him on magazines. We don't want him anywhere.'

MBTA Transit Officer Richard 'Dic' 
Donahue, who almost died when he was shot during a firefight with the Tsarnaev brothers, said: 'I cannot and do not 
condone the cover of the magazine.'

Despite the overwhelmingly negative reactions, the editors of Rolling Stone refused to apologize for their controversial choice, claiming it was in keeping with their long tradition of serious journalism.

In their brief statement, Rolling Stone - founded in the 1960s by Jann Wenner who is still editor-in-chief - said their 'hearts go out to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing, and our thoughts are always with them'.

'The cover story we are publishing this week falls within the traditions of journalism and Rolling Stone's long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day,' it said.

Weak: In response to the cover, police photographer Sgt Sean Murphy released images, including this one, he took of the moment a bloodied Tsarnaev was apprehended in Watertown on April 19

Pointing out that Dzhokhar is in the 
same age group as many of their readers, Rolling Stone said that fact 
'makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of 
this issue'.

The use of Tsarnaev as cover star caused an immediate backlash on social media and CVS and Walgreens announced that they would be boycotting the edition from their stores nationwide.

Between them, CVS and Walgreens have more than 15,000 locations across the U.S.

In response to the cover, police photographer Sgt. Sean Murphy released photographs showing a weak and bloodied Tsarnaev in the moments before he was captured.

The Massachusetts police did not authorize the release of the images, and he has now been put on desk duty until an investigation into his conduct is complete.

Tsarnaev, who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Massachusetts, has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four killings - associated with the bombing.
