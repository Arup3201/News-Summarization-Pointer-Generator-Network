Caught on camera: David Jones went on the rampage in Manchester with a replica gun

Dramatic footage of a 'shotgun-wielding' robber threatening staff in a bookmakers and a petrol station has been released today.

David Jones, 40, is now starting a five-year jail sentence after going on the rampage with an imitation shotgun.

Police said he caused terror as he carried out the raids in the Oldham area of Greater Manchester wearing a balaclava and hi-visibility jacket.

Manchester Crown Court heard that Jones was in debt and used the replica in a bid to pay off what he owed.

At around 9.30pm on 11 May this year, Jones drove a Vauxhall Astra up to the kiosk of an Asda 
petrol station in Chadderton, Greater Manchester.

He managed to steal several hundred pounds at the petrol station after pointing the imitation gun at a clerk.

She handed over the cash before he drove off.

The next day he tried his luck again at a William Hill bookmakers in Rochdale.

At 8.25pm, he walked into the 
shop where there were two cashiers and a customer.

He was carrying his fake gun in a black plastic bin liner and demanded staff gave him money.

Trying his luck: Jones has successfully stolen money from a petrol station the night before and was looking to repeat his success

Terror: Jones walked around the William Hill bookmakers on Oldham Road, Rochdale in his balaclava and high visibility jacket

The
 staff, who ran into the back after seeing Jones walk in wearing a 
balaclava, did not give him any and he walked off empty handed. He drove
 off in the Vauxhall Astra.

Detective Constable Dave Meeney from the
 Serious Organised Crime Group said: 'Following a police investigation, 
Jones led us to a mill off Osborne Street that he had access to.

'Inside,
 we found the car, a high vis jacket that he wore during the first 
crime, his balaclava and the imitation gun.'

'Although the gun was not real, the victims were not to know this and the CCTV gives an example of the terror he caused.

Threatening: Hoping to pay off his considerable debts, Jones demanded staff give him money but they had run for safety

Empty-handed: Staff had gone to the safe room and refused to hand over any money to him

'They were naturally scared when they were faced with a man wearing a balaclava and holding a weapon.'

'In the second incident at William Hill, the staff members were able to lock themselves in the back office and nothing was taken.

'From what officers uncovered, Jones was in a lot of debt and thought he would target businesses to help pay for it. Now he is paying for what he has done and is behind bars.'

CCTV released by Greater Manchester Police shows the raid on the bookmakers first and then the attack at the petrol station.

Jones of Shaw, near Oldham, was charged with one count of robbery, one count of attempted robbery, and two counts of possession of an imitation shotgun.

He was sentenced to five years today after pleading guilty at a previous hearing.
