A New Jersey high school cheerleader who claims she was ‘abandoned’ by her mother and retired police chief father when they kicked her out for not playing by their rules filed a lawsuit last week demanding they fork over immediate financial support.

Rachel Canning has turned 18 but the rare lawsuit aims to force her parents to support her even though she’s living with a friend’s family who are shelling out thousands for her attorney fees.

Meanwhile, Sean Canning has shot back saying his college-bound daughter is nothing but a ‘spoiled’ liar who left home on her own when she couldn’t live by the former officer’s rules.

Sick: Rachel's mother submitted court documents in which she claimed to have supported her daughter throughout her bulimia battle after finding garbage sacks full of vomit hidden in her bedroom

Won't pay: Rachel's retired police chief father Sean Canning denies he and his wife Amy kicked out Rachel and say she left on her own accord because she didn't want to follow his rules. He's fighting back against his daughter's financial demands

While her exact reason for leaving remains foggy, neither side in the Morris County, New Jersey suit is refuting that Rachel left her home in comfortable Lincoln Park sometime on or near her 18th birthday on November 1.

Rachel, who’s already received acceptance letters to several universities and a $20,000 scholarship offer from a New York private college, claims she was forced out of her home on her birthday after her father and mother Amy jointly decided to cut her off ‘from all support both financially and emotionally.’

‘My parents have rationalized their 
actions by blaming me for not following their rules,’ court papers filed
 on behalf of the teen claim. ‘They stopped paying my high school 
tuition to punish the school and me and have redirected my college fund 
indicating their refusal to afford me an education as a punishment.’

According
 to DailyRecord.com, Sean and Amy Canning owe Morris Catholic $5,306 in 
tuition they’ve neglected to pay since the start of the family feud.

The father of Rachel's friend, attorney john Inglesino (pictured) says he and his wife are helping her sue her parents because without her parents, 'Rachel's ability to fulfill her potential will be greatly diminished'

And it’s not just because of their missing money that school administrators appear to be backing Rachel.

'Rachel
 has excellent grades and will not be removed from the school for this 
non-payment; however her parents do have a contractual obligation to 
pay. Rachel is certainly unable at this time to attend Morris Catholic 
High School full-time and support herself financially,' Morris Catholic 
president Michael St. Pierre wrote in a certification to the court.

St.
 Pierre said the school called New Jersey Child Protection and 
Permanency last fall after abuse allegations from Rachel and what he 
called ‘difficult meetings between Rachel and Mr. Canning.’

Mr.
 Canning admits a state worker visited the home just prior to Rachel’s 
alleged ‘abandonment,’ but that the official found the teen simply to be
 ‘spoiled’ and didn’t pursue the abuse allegations.

'We
 love our child and miss her. This is terrible. It’s killing me and my 
wife. We have a child we want home. We’re not draconian and now we’re 
getting hauled into court. She’s demanding that we pay her bills but she
 doesn’t want to live at home and she’s saying “I don’t want to live 
under your rules,”' Mr. Canning said.

Mr.
 Canning contends that his daughter left on her own accord because she 
was simply unwilling to follow his demands she be respectful, do her 
chores, and give back some of her sister's borrowed belongings.

'We’re
 heartbroken but what do you do when a child says "I don’t want your 
rules but I want everything under the sun and you to pay for it?”'

Mr. Canning was unavailable for comment when a call was made to his office at Mt. Olive Township Monday afternoon.

He admits that he's stopped paying Rachel's high school tuition but says she'll receive her existing college fund.

But
 that’s just not enough, says John Inglesino, an attorney and former 
local city official whose already paid $12,597 for Rachel’s lawyer Tanya
 N. Helfand, who claims his daughter friend is ‘emotionally distraught 
by her parents’ sudden rejection of her.’

‘Rachel
 is likeable, communicates exceptionally well and is highly motivated to
 attend and excel at a college appropriate for her. That is why my wife 
and I have decided to fund this lawsuit. We know that if Mr. and Mrs. 
Canning are not required to fulfil their legal obligations as parents, 
that Rachel’s ability to fulfil her potential will be greatly 
diminished,’ Inglesino wrote to the court.

Inglesino did not immediately return MailOnline's call for comment.

Just spoiled? Rachel alleged she was being abused last fall, which helped prompt officials at her school to call child protective services. But Rachel's father says the state worker only found that his daughter is 'spoiled'

'My parents have rationalized their actions by blaming me for not following their rules,' Rachel said in court papers. The 18-year-old has offers to attend several colleges and is an accomplished cheerleader and lacrosse player who hopes to one day be a biomedical engineer

Rachel is demanding her parents pay her college tuition and expenses, transportation costs, cover her current high school tuition and even pay her legal fees.

Her attorney’s argument that these are all reasonable demands spin solely on the fact that 18-year-old Rachel, who says she wants to study biomedical engineering, will be a student.

Helfand says her client has not ‘moved beyond (her parents’) sphere of influence’ and per New Jersey law may be deemed non-emancipated.

‘A child’s admittance and attendance at college will overcome the rebuttable presumption that a child may be emancipated at age 18,’ reads an earlier state court decision.

But the attorney for Mr. and Mrs. Canning Laurie Rush-Masuret is claiming Rachel removed herself from that 'sphere of influence' when she voluntary left her parents' home.Family law attorneys Sheldon Simon disagrees.

‘A child is not emancipated until they’re on their own…Even if a child and the parents don’t get along that doesn’t relieve the parents of their responsibility,’ Simon told the DailyRecord.

Simon said he's never seen anything like the lawsuit in 40 years of practice.

Judge Peter Bogaard has scheduled a the first court hearing for Tuesday in Morristown, Pennsylvania.

Forced to pay? Rachel currently attends Morris Catholic High School. her father admits he and his wife stopped paying her tuition when she moved out. The school says they're contractually obligated to pay up and have decided to allow Rachel to finish her studies
