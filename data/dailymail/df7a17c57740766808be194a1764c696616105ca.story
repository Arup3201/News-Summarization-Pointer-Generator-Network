When Paul Hills met his wife, Carole, when he was 21 and she was 46, he may well have expected to end up nursing her in her older years.

But Carole, now 69, has actually become the carer for her toyboy, now 44, after his health declined.

Paul, from Colchester, Essex, explains: 'I got osteoarthritis and can't do very much. I spend a lot of time in bed and can only go out on my mobility scooter. Carole actually takes care of me.

Age gap love: There are 25 years between Paul and Carole who have been married for more than two decades

'She is brilliant and I want everyone to know that. This isn't how it should be. I should be looking after her.'

The pair have 'his n hers' mobility scooters which they can often be seen riding while holding hands in their home town.

Their 21-year marriage has defied critics who said it wouldn't last because of their 25-year age gap.

Paul was a 21-year-old musician when he met Carole, then 46, when she was finding gigs for the budding singer and guitarist in Portsmouth.

'His n' hers': The pair hold hands as they ride their mobility scooters - which Paul, 44, needs as he suffers from osteoarthritis. Carole, 69, has become his carer

Despite his initial reservations, he succumbed to Carole's advances, jokingly calling her a nymphomaniac after their first night together, as they appear on Channel 5's Age Gap Love documentary. 

After they started dating, it wasn't long before Carole hinted at marriage but Paul wanted to wait for two years to ensure they were making the right decision.

They have now been married for more than two decades but Paul admits times have changed since they first met.

Paul was 21 and Carole was 46 when they first met and they married two years later in 1994

He said: 'We were out partying and dancing all the time. It was all sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. In the end, we got married in 1994.'

He added that they had to overcome some 'negativity' because of their age difference. 

Many of his friends and family were worried he would end up looking after Carole in her old age, in fact the reverse has happened.

'I should be looking after her,' Paul admits. Everyone thought he would end up caring for Carole because of their age gap but the reverse has happened 

Paul said: 'My family were very understanding, but my mum was a little bit worried about how it would work out. But we have just had great fun.

'We didn't have any children and while we looked at adopting, it wasn't meant to be. But I have Carole, and she is amazing.'
