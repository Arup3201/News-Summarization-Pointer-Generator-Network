Sci-fi fans have long dreamed of having a robotic assistant like R2D2 or Rosie the housecleaning robot in The Jetsons.

And while some of the droid’s functions may be a few years off, a new generation of helpful robots have arrived and can act as everything from personal assistants to camera operators.

While they may be designed to do different jobs, a handful of the robots featured at the RoboBusiness conference in Boston have one thing in common – they are designed to follow their leader.

A robot called Budgee is designed to follow people to carry heavy items, such as shopping (illustrated). It is able to carry 50lbs (23kg) of shopping and follows at a comfortable distance from its owner

A robot called Budgee is designed to follow elderly and disabled people to carry heavy items, such as shopping, Wired’s Tim Moynihan reported. 

Made by Five Elements Robotics, the robotic assistant looks friendly and features a netted basket.

To make Budgee follow, its owner will wear a small device and uses an app to set the distance between them and the following robot.

The helpful droid will be able to tail its owners at speeds of up to 2.4mph (3.9kph) and send them a text if it can’t keep up. Sensors prevent it from falling down steps or bumping into obstacles.

Budgee will come in different sizes, be able to be folded up and weighs 20lbs (9kg), while it will be capable of carting around 50lbs (23kg). It will go on sale in January from $1,400 (£879).

People may want a droid for more vain needs. The Iris+ drone (pictured) is designed to follow its owner and has onboard cameras to capture them from above, working like a robotic cameraman

For golfers, there’s a smart cart called CaddyTrek that follows behind them with golf clubs. All they have to do is to wear a module on their belt, which includes a remote control, so the cart doens;t get too close to them when they are taking an important shot.

A similar model called AirDog is billed as a ‘pet’ drone and will automatically follows its owner who will wear a small programmable remote.

The drone could be fitted with a GoPro camera to capture high definition footage of extreme sports, tracking everything from skateboarders to BMX riders.

Following drones are also useful in industrial settings. Harvey, a bot made by Harvest Automation, can work in groups to tend plants in nurseries, for example (pictured)

The AirDog has a flight time of up to 15 minutes, and can reach speeds of 40 mph.

Take-off and landing is completely autonomous, and the AirDog has preset flight modes to track different sports - including surfing, motocross, wakeboarding and skateboarding.

The firm say the key to the drone is the algorithm it uses to track people.

'It took a year and countless caffeine-fuelled hours, that were spent hacking intelligent flight code algorithms,' said Edgars Rozentals, CEO and founder of Helico Aerospace Industries, who came up with the $995 (£625) drone which could be pre-ordered via Kicktstarter.

Following drones are also useful in industrial settings. Harvey, a bot made by Harvest Automation, can work in groups to tend plants in nurseries, for example.

A real drive-thru: In a chinese reaturant, robot waiters follow tracks painted on the floor to carry food to tables from the kitchen, where they collect dishes prepared by a robotic chef that are placed on a conveyor belt

‘Strings’ of bots follow patterns marked out on the floor, using a Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) to work out humans to follow and obstacles to avoid.

While the following system is more precise, Lidar is expensive and the robots cost $30,000 (£18,837) each.

More simple following technology is already been used in everyday settings. For example,  robotic waiters carry food to hungry diners by following lines painted on floors in restaurants in China.

There are even inexpensive toys that can follow lines marked on floors, using basic light sensors.
