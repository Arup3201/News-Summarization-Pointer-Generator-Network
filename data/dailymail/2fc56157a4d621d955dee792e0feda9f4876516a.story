After the wettest winter on record, it might seem hard to believe. But many of us have been living through a drought for the last fortnight, weather experts revealed last night.

Meteorologists in southern England recorded a 16-day stretch without a drop of rain, officially long enough to be classed as a drought.

Much of the country has seen an unseasonably warm and dry March. Temperatures have soared to 20C (68F) on two consecutive weekends and there have been unbroken blue skies for most areas.

The weather saw families streaming on
 to beaches while others got out their barbecues. Plant centres said 
their sales had ‘gone bananas’, as homeowners took advantage of the 
weather to tidy up their bedraggled and windblown gardens.

But that warm spell ended on Thursday night with downpours, and today and tomorrow will be much colder and more unsettled.

Dr
 Roger Brugge, meteorologist at the University of Reading, said a 
drought is defined as 15 consecutive days with less than 0.2mm of rain.

The
 university’s weather systems recorded no rainfall at all for 16 days – 
which the Met Office confirmed was representative of the wider picture 
across South and South East England.

Dr Brugge said it had been the longest spell without rain in March for seven years.

Having fun: The weather saw families streaming on to beaches, while others brought out barbecues. But it eventually gave way to cold and rainy conditions on Thursday

‘These
 dry conditions have prevailed across a large part of England during the
 past fortnight, due to the persistence of an area of high pressure 
which has also made March much warmer than average so far,’ he said.

‘But
 overnight on Thursday 3.5mm (0.14inches) of rain fell in Reading, and 
more rainfall appears to be likely to fall, albeit mostly small amounts,
 on and off at times on most days during the remainder of March.

‘So
 far, 2014 has gone from one extreme to another, from the wettest winter
 on record to a meteorological drought, although those who are still 
drying out their front rooms could be forgiven for not noticing.’

Although
 the 16-day dry period constitutes a meteorological drought, the 
Environment Agency has not declared an official drought.

To declare a drought, the Agency considers river flows, water supply and reservoir levels.

Because
 Britian has had such heavy rainfall this winter, groundwater levels are
 very high and there are unlikely to be problems with water shortages 
this year.

Prediction: Saturday will be grey and gloomy. There will be a brief respite from the bad weather on Sunday and Monday, with showers still affecting parts of the country, before the 'unsettled conditions' begin

Warning: Despite the recent sunny conditions, a Met Office forecaster said most people will experience rain over the next seven days

This 
weekend will be cooler than recent weekends, with the mercury unlikely 
to rise above 12C (54F) and wintry showers forecast over high ground in 
the North. Temperatures will even dip to a frosty -2C (28F) tomorrow 
night.

But forecasters 
are hoping for a return to the better weather by next weekend. The dry 
and warm weather of the last fortnight has seen gardeners rushing to 
beautify their borders. Garden centres are rushing to stock up after 
showing caution early in spring, with some missing out on early sales 
after running out of plants.

Chichester-based
 grower Blue Ribbon Plants has already sold out of its annual stock of 
300,000 primroses after a huge influx in demand.Walter
 Back, who owns the company, said he had to throw away thousands of 
unsold plants this time last year, because the country was still 
snowbound.

Retailers 
are predicting a boom in vegetable planting this year, after increasing 
food prices and tight family budgets have seen an increasing number of 
vegetable plots and allotments.

Garden
 centres say demand is greatest for traditional heritage varieties of 
fruit and veg, which many supermarkets have ditched in favour of 
imports.
