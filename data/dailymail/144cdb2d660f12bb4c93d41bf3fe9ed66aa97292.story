The charred remains of the Washington house that crazed father Josh Powell blew up when he was determined to kill himself and his two young sons has been removed after serving as a disturbing reminder of the horrific incident for two months.

The home in Graham, Washington was where Powell killed trapped his two sons Charlie, 7, and Braden, 5, during a supervised visit before he chopped them with a hatchet and lit two gasoline cans to create a fatal blaze on Feburary 5.

A demolition crew tore away every trace of the home- including the driveway- on Thursday.

Rubble: The charred remains of the Washington house where crazed father Josh Powell blew up himself and his two sons was when he was  removed after serving as a disturbing reminder of the incident for two months

What remains: The house was set up as a sham to fool the social worker who supervised the family's visits

'It’s a hell of a sight,' said Patrick Small, the property owner who rented the house to Powell since 2011.

'“Every time the neighbors walk out the door, they get reminded just by looking. It’s a horrible sight to look at,' he told the local Bellingham Herald.

The house was valued at $158,900 before the fire, and because he only had $100,000 worth of insurrance on the home, Mr Small is 'out about 60,000 bucks'.

The ghastly remains of the home have served as a reminder of the unanswered questions surrounding the case.

Powell was married to Susan Cox Powell, who went missing from their home in December 2009 in West Valley, Utah. He returned to his hometown of Puyallup, Washington with his sons but lost custody after his father, Steven Powell, was arrested for investigation of voyeurism and child pornography.

He was still under investigation when he killed himself and his sons, and though they were living with their maternal grandparents for the most part, he saw them on that fateful day while being supervised by a court-appointed social worker.

Happier times: Josh Powell blew up the property when he found out he was not getting custody of his two sons

Sham: The house that Josh Powell blew up to kill himself and his two sons was used as a ruse for social workers. He did not live there but placed photographs around to give the impression he did

Powell slammed the door in her face and she promptly calle 911 but that was not quick enough as he had already begun his killing spree.

In the days and weeks following the 
incident, Pierce county sheriffs determined that the home itself was 
part of his elaborate plan, saying that the home was a sham set up only 
to fool the social worker on the supervised visits.

Questions: Powell was the sole person of interest in the case of his missing wife Susan

Powell rented the house in 2011 but neighbours said they never saw it occupied.

'He set it up like a rental place, with pictures of the family,' Sergeant Denny Wood Wood of the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department said.

'I think it was staged so when CPS [Child Protective Services] came, it would look like a loving family.'

In the ensuing investigation, police found boxes of records in Josh Powell's room, the News Tribune reported, including gasoline receipts.

'He was a very meticulous, thoughtful 
person. This guy doesn't work on emotion,' Wood said. 'We have been 
working since that day to get those kids away from him.'

Detective
Gary Sanders added: 'He committed the most evil act. And he gave them 
the greatest gift, which is to be in their mother’s arms.'

Since
the explosion, police have found new evidence relating to Susan 
Powell's disappearance. They discovered a blood-stained comforter, which
they are testing, in his storage unit.

Investigators
also found toys and kids' clothes in garbage bags in the unit, as well 
as framed pictures. Those items were given to Susan Powell's family.
