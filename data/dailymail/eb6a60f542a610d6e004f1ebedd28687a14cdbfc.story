Britain’s fattest teenager will be kept in hospital for at least six months as she tries to shed enough weight to have a gastric band fitted - though her friends have joked she hopes to be out in time to have Christmas dinner.

Georgia Davis, 19, who was 63 stone at her heaviest, is being treated for obesity related health problems at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales.

Friends yesterday revealed how Georgia, 19, is sticking to her strict hospital food diet and is pledging to get back to health - although she will spend the rest of the year in hospital.

One friend said: “She has been told she will have three months in hospital before being taken to a special obesity hospital where she could have surgery.

Diet: Miss Davis, 19, has shed three stone due to a strict calorie-controlled programme

“She is very unhappy but knows things have to change if she is going to have any sort of life.

“Georgia
said she is hoping to be out for Christmas. Knowing her that is all 
about Christmas lunch - it is one of her favourites.”

Georgia had to be cut out of her house in Aberdare, South Wales, to be rushed to hospital for emergency treatment last week.

She is due to stay for three months before going to a special obesity clinic 40 miles away at Morriston Hospital in Swansea.

Meanwhile,
it has emerged that Georgia would order up to eight kebabs at a time 
from a nearby takeaway where she would run up a bill of £5,000 each 
year.

The teenager used
to buy up to 20 kebabs a week - each one containing 2,000 calories - 
from the fast food restaurant near her home in Aberdare, Wales.

The teenager would also order two large 1.5 litre bottles of Coke to wash down her food feasts, a delivery driver revealed.

Builders had to demolish the wall of her home so she could be rushed to hospital when she was unable to stand up.

The teenager has now lost three stone in a week now after being put on a strictly-controlled diet by medics.

She weighs 52 stone and not the 63 stone which doctors had originally estimated.

Albert
Altia, a delivery driver who works for the local Marmaris kebab house, 
said the teenager's usual order was nine large kebabs - seven for 
herself and one each for her parents.

The driver said: 'That is a ridiculous amount of food for one person. I would not eat seven kebabs in a month.'

Mr Altian thought there was a party at the house the first time he made a delivery.

'I once delivered 10 kebabs there. I think that was one for the mother, one for the father and the rest for her,' he said.

Each large kebab costs £4.90.

Deliveries: She would order junk food from Tesco and Asda and sneak it past her parents

Her parents revealed she ordered junk food online and would sneak the deliveries past them at their home in Aberdare, Wales.

Mother
Lesley Davis and stepfather Arthur Treloar revealed that they tried to 
help the teen - who was believed to weigh up to 63 stone - eat 
healthily, but they discovered her buying cakes, fizzy drinks and 
takeaways online.

Miss Davis's mother Lesley, 57, told The Sun:
'Arthur and I would be watching TV in the lounge and Georgia would make
her way downstairs, casually saying, "It's hot in my bedroom. I'm just 
going outside for some fresh air."

'We now know that she was meeting the delivery van and secretly carrying the food upstairs to her bedroom.

'She had been eating all sorts of naughty things like sausage rolls, pasties and cakes - and drinking lots of Coke.'

Schoolfriend Leah Price, 20, said: 'I remember seeing Iceland and Tesco vans pulling up at least once or twice a week and I saw takeaway pizza's and kebabs all the time.

'My friend has been eating herself to death and no one was helping her. If they had helped her sooner it wouldn't have come to this - it's a tragedy.'

Georgia is currently hooked up to an oxygen tank on a specially-designed £4,000 bed while doctors at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil carry out tests.

She is suffering from complications including diabetes and kidney failure, as well as problems with her spine, joints and skin.

She vowed to lose weight and get her life back on track, saying: "I'm sick of being like this - I'm getting my life back."

She has been given a special gown to wear after admitting she had outgrown all her own clothes and was forced to use a bedsheet to cover her modesty.

The public response to her dramatic hospitalisation hasn't been all positive.

Last week she was forced to delete her Facebook page after she was targeted by cyberbullies who were taunting her online.

As
well as having her personal account abused the teenager also had to 
contend with one troll creating a new Facebook page called RIP Georgia 
Davis - which has since been taken down. The page said: 'You are just a 
big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope 
you die soon.

'You fat blob, you are adding 
millions of pounds to the tax payers bill. If I had my way I would wipe 
that fat grin off your face by making you pay us back.'

Another anonymous commenter said: 'Why don’t you just stop eating so much you fat fool.

'You are just a big lazy girl who loves cake - you are a fat waste of space and I hope you die soon.'

It was reported to the site by her friends and has now been removed.

The teen's best friend Jade Tarrant also 
revealed how Miss Davis lost weight after moving in with her, but 
returned home to care for her sick father after he was diagnosed with 
lung cancer - and the weight piled back on.

Miss Tarrant said: 'I always knew it was going to get this bad if she went home again.

'She would have lost weight if she stayed with me because I like my salads and I could have got her on it.

'But she missed her mum and step-dad. She ended up going back and putting her own health at risk.'

Georgia eventually stopped venturing outside altogether and, by the time a 50-man emergency team cut her free, she had not left the house for about eight months.

A
hospital spokesman said: 'Georgia is still undergoing investigations 
and receiving treatment from a range of health professionals.

'We are pleased to advise that her clinical condition is stable.'
