Actor Paul Bhattacharjee was declared bankrupt shortly before he committed suicide at cliffs, an inquest has heard.

The 53-year-old, who had starred in James Bond film Casino Royale and EastEnders, was a ‘proud’ man who would not have wanted the bankruptcy becoming public knowledge, his partner said.

Emma McKie added in a statement read in court: ‘I do believe that Paul would take his own life. He had a darkness inside him that was irreparable.’

Death: Paul Bhattacharjee, who had starred in James Bond film Casino Royale and EastEnders, was a ‘proud’ man who would not have wanted the bankruptcy becoming public knowledge

Mr Bhattacharjee, who lived in 
Elephant and Castle, central London, was last seen leaving rehearsals in
 London on July 10, the inquest at Eastbourne Magistrates’ Court in East
 Sussex was told.

Following 
his disappearance, Ms McKie opened some letters in his flat and 
discovered he had been declared bankrupt the day before, on July 9.

She
 added in her statement: ‘He was a proud and protective man and he 
couldn’t have handled the bankruptcy becoming public knowledge.

‘He
 would not have wanted to let me down or hurt me or his friends. The 
bankruptcy was the final straw after a life of major highs and lows.’

Describing
 him as a beautiful and loving man, she said he had a close knit group 
of friends, including three or four he had known since his 20s.

‘He
 put on a hard exterior to those at work but protected himself,’ Ms 
McKie went on. ‘I knew about his past and the pain inside him, and I 
could see it in his eyes.’

The
 body of the actor, whose full name was Gautam Paul Bhattacharjee, was 
spotted near cliffs in Seaford, East Sussex, on July 12.

There
 was no evidence of drugs and only a small blood alcohol reading of 42mg
 per 100ml, according to a report by toxicologist Andrew Smith, of the 
Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.

A post-mortem examination carried out by pathologist Dr David Wright found that his cause of death was from multiple injuries.

Ms
 McKie last saw her partner on July 10 when he had complained about 
having a bad stomach. She called him at 7pm that night to say she was on
 her way home.

He texted her
 later to say he was very late and told her to have dinner without him. A
 final text message received by Ms McKie at 9.16pm that night included 
the words: ‘I’m sorry.’

A 
member of the public reported seeing what they thought was a body at 
cliffs below Splash Point in Seaford on the evening of July 12, and it 
was later recovered.

Initial
 inquiries to try to find out who the man was proved fruitless. Then, on
 July 17, a colleague of coroner’s officer Karen Brown saw an article 
online about the disappearance of Mr Bhattacharjee.

Sussex
 Police liaised with the Metropolitan Police and the body was confirmed 
as that of Mr Bhattacharjee later that day, the inquest was told.

East
 Sussex coroner Alan Craze later received an anonymous letter disclosing
 that his death was deliberate and ‘linking it wholly and entirely to 
his bankruptcy’.

Mr Bhattacharjee made several TV appearances. He is seen opposite Peter Firth in the BBC spy series Spooks

Mr Bhattacharjee's theatre work included Moazzam Begg in the docu-drama Guantanamo at the Tricycle Theatre, north-west London, and Malvolio in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night at the Albery in London's West End

Tributes 
poured in from colleagues across stage and screen following the death of
 the star, who had also appeared in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, 
White Teeth and Dirty Pretty Things.

'Paul was an incredibly gifted versatile and generous actor'

Meera Syal, actress

Meera
 Syal, who appeared alongside him in the Royal Shakespeare Company 
production of Much Ado about Nothing, said: ‘Paul was an incredibly 
gifted versatile and generous actor but also complex, deep thinking, 
engagingly opinionated and politically committed as a personality, truly
 wonderful to share a stage with.’

Tributes
 were also paid on Twitter, with director Jamie Lloyd writing: ‘Very sad
 to hear about the death of Paul Bhattacharjee. He was a very fine 
actor. My thoughts are with his family.’

Muzz
 Khan, who appeared in Much Ado About Nothing alongside the late actor, 
said: ‘Rest In Peace, Paul Bhattacharjee. I can’t believe you’re gone, 
mate.’

Playwright Duncan 
Gates wrote: ‘When you depart from me sorrow abides and happiness takes 
his leave. RIP Paul Paul Bhattacharjee.’

Mr Bhattacharjee, who went missing after leaving the 
Royal Court Theatre on July 10, played the lead role of Benedick last year in the 
RSC's production of Much Ado About Nothing with Meera Syal as Beatrice

Following
 his disappearance, Bend It Like Beckham actress Parminder Nagra, Sex in
 the City star Kim Cattrall and Stephen Fry - who went missing for a 
week in 1995 - appealed to their Twitter followers for information about
 the actor.

'He was extremely depressed at the time. This was a huge tragedy for a lot of people'

Alan Craze, East Sussex coroner

Mr Bhattacharjee
 played a doctor in Casino Royale in 2006 and was in several episodes of
 EastEnders as Masood’s brother Inzamam between 2008 and 2010.

Other television credits for the actor included Waking the Dead, Spooks and The Bill.

Detective
 Sergeant David Tye, of Sussex Police, told the inquest there was no 
indication anyone else played a part in the actor’s death.

Recording
 a conclusion of suicide, Mr Craze said: ‘There isn’t scope at all in 
this case and therefore the conclusion of this inquest will be that 
Gautam Paul Bhattacharjee took his own life whilst the balance of his 
mind was disturbed.’

Mr Craze added: ‘He was extremely depressed at the time. This was a huge tragedy for a lot of people.’

Friends and family of Mr Bhattacharjee left court without commenting.
