An upstate New York surgeon and his hospital are being accused of greed and negligence in a series of malpractice lawsuits.

Dr. Spyros Panos, formerly a surgeon at Saint Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., are facing hundreds of malpractice lawsuits over accusations he sliced people open and sewed them back up without actually performing any procedures, or that he performed the wrong surgery

Scheduling as many as 22 surgeries a day, an almost unheard of workload, Panos was billing for work never completed and his out of control greed resulted in the death of a 76-year-old woman, one of the lawsuits alleges.

Panos reportedly would schedule up to 22
 surgeries a day, most surgeons only schedule 32 procedures a month, 
according to industry statistics quoted by ABC News.

Debra Nenni McNamee alleges that in 2009 Panos was to have performed surgery on her 76-year-old mother Constance Nenni’s left knee to repair damage caused by arthritis, according to ABC. Panos is said to have described the procedure as ‘a simple in and out.’

The procedure involved a small camera being inserted into Nenni’s knee to help clean out any dead or damaged tissue found, a fairly routine procedure. McNamee claims that less than 24 hours after the surgery, Nenni died of a pulmonary embolism said to have been caused by a blood clot that broke free and blocked the lung’s main artery, according to reports.

Though not a common occurrence from knee surgery, older adults are more prone to such complications from any type of surgery. The Dutchess County (NY) medical examiner’s report, purportedly, is what did Panos in.

Panos allegedly had fudged all the post-surgery notes related to the six procedures he had performed on the family patriarch. The medical examiner's autopsy showed no evidence that he had ever removed torn cartilage, smoothed areas of excess wear or removed soft tissue from within the knee joint – he simply opened and closed her knee without so much as a single bit of repair, the Poughkeepsie Journal originally reported.

‘He put her under anesthesia, placed the scope in her knee and then closed her up without performing any surgery,’ Brian Brown, McNamee’s lawyer told ABC. ‘The reports showed no hardware in place and, certainly, no evidence of a total knee reconstruction.’

McNamee’s case wasn’t a one-off, according to several reports. Former patients have brought a total of 250 malpractice suits against Mid-Hudson Medical Group, parent of Saint Francis and Vassar Hospitals, and Panos, according to reports. Both hospitals, located in Poughkeepsie, have declined on multiple occasions to comment, as has Panos. A message seeking comment left with Brent Fleming, Panos' attorney, was not returned.

Evading liability?: Many are accusing the Mid-Hudson Medical Group, Panos' former employer, of trying to evade liability by attempting to transfer assets to Mount Kisco Medical Group

In another instance, Panos is accused of having performed the wrong surgery.

Barbara Murphy was to have a broken collarbone fixed by Panos in 2010, instead he operated on her rotator cuff as if it was broken, despite there being no evidence to suggest that procedure was necessary, she told the Journal.

Dismissed: Mid-Hudson Medical Group dismissed Panos over the alleged malpractices

Making matters even worse, the Mid-Hudson Medical Group is in the midst of a deal that some believe is an effort to evade liability over Panos, who has since been fired and is also under a federal investigation.

Rival Mount Kisco Medical Group and Mid-Hudson are trying combine assets in a transaction that will transfer ownership of current Mid-Hudson asset to Mount Kisco, leaving Mid-Hudson as nothing more than a shell company that would eventually dissolve, according to the Journal.

Though both sides are adamant the merger is about providing the best care to patients in the region, not everyone is convinced.

‘They are taking what’s valuable and will leave a defunct shell,’ said JT Wisell, an attorney representing 152 plaintiffs suing Panos.

Explaining that Mount Kisco would take Mid-Hudson’s doctors, and its revenue, financial expert Stephen Schulman told the paper that ‘you can’t sue someone with no money.’
