A mother says she is convinced that life begins at 40 after dropping six dress sizes and swapping unhealthy habits for a new career as a fitness instructor and personal trainer.

Lisa Rennison went from being unfit and inactive to cycling 80 miles and visiting the gym at least five times every week.

At her heaviest Miss Rennison, who is 5ft 2in, weighed 12st and wore size 18 clothes. But changes to her diet and a new interest in exercise saw her lose the excess weight in just 12 months.

New lease on life: Lisa Rennison, pictured here at a healthy 7st, says she is convinced that life begins at 40 after dropping six dress sizes in 12 months

This year Miss Rennison, a former customer services advisor from Peterborough, fulfilled a dream she never expected to come true when she qualified as a fitness instructor and personal trainer.

She now makes a living passing the secrets of her transformation onto others.

She said: 'Last September I was working in an office job which I hated. I decided I wanted to take the plunge and change careers, aged 39.

'I was scared going for a career change so late, but I was determined to start my 40s happy with what I was doing in my life.

Dream come true: Having qualified as a personal trainer in June, Miss Rennison now teaches a range of classes and has a sculpted six pack

'I haven’t looked back. I’ve just gone from strength to strength.'

Having qualified as a personal trainer in June, Miss Rennison, who is mother to 15-year-old Ben, now teaches a range of classes including Bodycombat, spin, and circuit training at four gyms.

She said: 'I’m very passionate about the classes I teach. The Bodycombat class uses every muscle group in the body. It’s definitely helped me change the shape of my body and get a six pack.'

When not teaching classes, she maintains her figure with regular cardio and weight training, yoga, pilates and high intensity interval training.

The old her: Lisa still keeps 'fat photos' to remind herself how far she has come and put her off eating

Passion: Lisa says she loves her job and the Bodycombat class uses every muscle group in the body - hence her sick pack

She said: 'I don’t own a car and I cycle everywhere, in all weathers, every single day. Cycling between the gyms probably means I cover 80 miles a week.'

Lisa put on weight because she became inactive in the run up to her pregnancy and didn't do any exercise at all, in stark contrast to today.

'I was unhappy with my weight and I did put even more weight on post baby but I had never been a slim person I had always been quite big. I got to the point where I was squeezing in a size 18 and that really upset so I decided to change. I didn't go on any diet as such I just completely changed my eating habits and lifestyle from very unhealthy to healthy.

'I cut out all processed foods, junk food, espacially sweets, cakes and white bread as I ate alot of these. I made changes like going from full fat milk to skimmed and changing from white bread to wholemeal. I dramatically reduced portion sizes as I used to pile my plate up. I lost a stone within a month just with these simple changes,' she said.

Over the course of a year she shrank down from size 18 to a size 6 and lost nearly 5st to reach a healthy 7st.

She has stayed trim ever since but to stay motivated she still carries reminders of the time when she was overweight and inactive.

She said: 'I keep my "fat photos" on my phone. I look at them all the time to remind myself how far I’ve come and to show my personal training clients that I was once big.

'I think having pictures of me at my biggest is good because it puts me off eating unhealthy things. It makes it easy to say no to bad foods. I never want to look like that again.'

Miss Rennison frequently posts fitness and motivation tips on her Facebook page entitled LRFitness and on Twitter.

She said: 'I still have to pinch myself to make sure I am not dreaming as I love what I do and it has all happened so quick.

'I actually look forward to going to work everyday - I’m in a very different place to how I felt going into the office.'
