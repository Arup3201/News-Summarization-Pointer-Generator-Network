A former specialist police officer who worked for Scotland Yard's division in charge of protecting the Royal Family was arrested today by detectives probing corrupt payments to public officials.

Police from Operation Elveden, which runs alongside the force's Weeting investigation into phone hacking, swooped on the 57-year-old man's home in Surrey at dawn this morning.

The retired officer worked as part of the Metropolitan Police’s Specialist Operations command, which has a host of security duties from providing armed protection for MPs and the Royal Family to counter-terrorism intelligence gathering.

Dawn raid: Police from Operation Elveden, which runs alongside the force's Operation Weeting investigation into phone hacking, swooped on the 57-year-old man's home in Surrey at 6.30 this morning

While officers searched his home, he was taken for questioning on suspicion of misconduct in a public office.

His is the 27th arrest by detectives working under Operation Elveden, the investigation into illegal payments made by journalists to public figures.

A force statement said: 'The 57-year-old man was arrested at his home address.

'He previously served in the MPS Specialist Operations command, based in central London, and retired several years ago.

Payments: Giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry
in January, The Sun's Royal Editor Duncan Larcombe acknowledged it was 'no secret' that his paper 
offers members of the public payments in return for tip-offs. He was arrested two weeks ago

'He is currently being questioned at a south west London police station and his home address is being searched.'

The
force added that the arrest 'is not about seeking journalists to reveal
confidential sources in relation to information that has been obtained 
legitimately'.

The arrest 
comes a fortnight after The Sun's royal editor, Duncan Larcombe, was 
arrested along with a 42-year-old former member of the Armed Forces and a
38-year-old woman as part of the same inquiry.

Arrested: Last month, The Sun's defence editor Virginia Wheeler, 32, was held on suspicion of illegal payments to police

Power: Mr Yates has expressed 'extreme regret' for ruling out reopening the hacking investigation at News International in 2009

So far the investigation has seen 12 journalists from The Sun newspaper detained in a scandal that has sent shockwaves across Fleet Street.

Last month, The Sun's defence editor Virginia Wheeler, 32, was held on suspicion of illegal payments to police.

The Sun’s deputy editor Geoff Webster, 
picture editor John Edwards, chief reporter John Kay, chief foreign 
correspondent Nick Parker, and news editor John Sturgis were arrested in February.

And the previous month former 
managing editor Graham Dudman, 48, now a training director at News 
International; executive editor Fergus Shanahan, 56, a former deputy 
editor of the paper under Rebekah Brooks; long-serving crime editor Mike
Sullivan, 48; and head of news Chris Pharo, 42 were also detained and later bailed.

journalists arrested

and the paper's picture editor John Edwards (right) have also been questioned by police

The MSC was set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal that led to the closure of the News of the World last July.

It is carrying out internal 
investigations relating to Rupert Murdoch's remaining UK papers - The 
Sun, The Times and The Sunday Times - and is working closely with the 
detectives investigating alleged phone hacking and corrupt payments.

The Crown Prosecution Service 
confirmed last month that it has received the first set of files from 
police relating to the inquiries.
