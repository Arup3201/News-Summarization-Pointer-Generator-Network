Jailed: Munir Hussain, 34, admitted driving while disqualified, dangerous driving, failing to provide a specimen and having no insurance

A convicted heroin dealer who led police on a high risk 20-minute chase and then deliberately rammed them has been jailed for almost a year.

Munir Hussain, 34, of Brierfield, Lancashire, raced the wrong way down a dual carriageway and around a maze of residential streets as the pursuit was filmed from the sky.

It ended when his tyres were punctured by a stinger and he crashed into a police car, sending one officer scrambling for his life.

Burnley Crown Court heard that Hussain had been sleeping rough in his Ford Transit van and feared police were about to arrest him for being disqualified and uninsured.

Hussain claimed he had been trying to start on a new life away from crime but the incident left him heading back to jail for a ten-month term.

The court heard how police in a marked BMW X5 began tailing the van on January 24 - but it sped off, and they turned on their blue lights.

Emma Kehoe, prosecuting, said: ‘Such was their concern, the police helicopter was deployed. The vehicle is seen, during the course of the pursuit, travelling onto the wrong side of the carriageway, travelling the wrong way up a dual carriageway at one point and on many narrow residential streets.

‘The vehicle is seen mounting pavements. The speeds vary. At some points the vehicle is travelling slowly, at other times it accelerates to beyond the speed limit. What is consistent throughout is it’s clear from the footage the van is well aware it is being followed by the police.

‘It refuses to stop for 20 minutes and in fact the only way the van is stopped is because a stinger is used. The defendant drove away and crashed into the police car, which was stationary.’

She added: ‘The officer is adamant he felt Mr Hussain’s vehicle was driven at the police vehicle on purpose. It’s clear the officer did feel that was the case as he describes himself as being terrified.

‘He tries to get from the driver’s seat to the passenger side, as the van is coming towards the driver’s side, but is not able to do that because of the speed of the van.

‘It then collides into the door of the police vehicle. He says he suffered whiplash as a result and had to go to the urgent care department.’

Miss Kehoe said when arrested Hussain smelled of alcohol but failed to provide a breath test.

Hussain admitted driving while disqualified, dangerous driving, failing to provide a specimen and having no insurance. He was also banned from driving for three years, when he must take an extended driving test.

Richard Taylor, defending, said: ‘This offence was borne out of frustration and desperation. 

'At the time he had nowhere to live and was sleeping in the back of a car. He had a new relationship with a girlfriend, who is in court and is supportive of him, and was determined to finish his old life of many drugs offences, drink offences and start a new life in Manchester.

‘Unfortunately, his means of doing that was flawed. He used a fairly elderly van and took a considerable risk in going to Manchester.’

Mr Taylor added: ‘He’s going to have to start all over again. He intends, as he has done in the past, to make the most of his time in custody.’

Judge Anthony Russell QC said: ‘The problem with offences of this nature is that, although, fortunately in this case nobody suffered serious injury, the fact of the matter is when driving of this nature occurs it’s very easy for people to become a victim when they don’t realise there is somebody dangerous coming along the road.’
