Liverpool welcome Arsenal to Anfield this weekend and we could be in for a festive feast of goals - because this fixture has brought about the most hat-tricks in Premier League history.

Five trebles have been scored in this match-up since the inception of the Premier League, one more than has been netted in Newcastle United vs Manchester United fixtures.

Four of those hat-tricks have come at Anfield, while one took place at Highbury - meaning there is a good chance of a high scoreline on Sunday.

This fixture's first hat-trick hero in the Premier League era was Robbie Fowler, who scored three times at Anfield in August 1994.

His trio of goals was, with just four minutes and 35 seconds before the first and the third strikes, is in fact the quickest hat-trick in Premier League history.

And it was Fowler again who scored a hat-trick 16 months later.

Just two days before Christmas in 1995, Fowler responded to Ian Wright's eight-minute penalty by scoring in the 40th, 59th and 78th minute to give the Reds victory at Anfield.

Liverpool vs Arsenal has produced the most hat-tricks in a single fixture in Premier League history.

Now Arsenal's first treble against Liverpool came via, you guessed it, Thierry Henry.

The Frenchman, aided by a strike from fellow countryman Robert Pires, led the Gunners to a 4-2 victory at Highbury in April 2004.

The fourth hat-trick of this fixture was scored by Peter Crouch in March 2007, when the big striker helped Liverpool to a 4-1 victory at Anfield.

Finally, arguably the pick of the bunch is Andrey Arshavin's hat-trick - because it was actually a quadruple!

In a brilliant 4-4 draw at Anfield in April 2009, Arshavin scored all of Arsenal's goals and crowned one of the all-time great individual performances in Premier League history.
