Stevan Jovetic showed just why Manchester City are refusing to consider letting him return to Italy just a year after arriving from Fiorentina for £22million as the Premier League champions demolished AC Milan in Pittsburgh.

The Montenegro forward has been strongly linked with a move to Inter Milan following a forgettable first season in England in which he spent much of his time on the treatment table, making a total of two Premier League starts.

But Manuel Pellegrini insists that Jovetic is going nowhere and City duly demolished Inter’s neighbours by scoring four goals inside the opening 26 minutes at Heinz Field. Jovetic made a key contribution to an emphatic win, scoring twice and only missing out on a hat-trick because another well-taken effort was ruled out for offside.

Star man: Stevan Jovetic

'Stevan is working well with us,’ said Pellegrini in the build-up to the game. ‘He is a very important player for our team. Maybe there are a lot of rumours about his future but Stevan will stay with us.'

As good as Jovetic and City were last night, Milan defended atrociously. They looked every inch a fallen giant that finished eighth in Serie A last season and lost their opening game in this International Champions Cup competition 3-0 to Olympiacos last week.

When they met City in the Audi Cup in Munich last summer, they were five down before half-time before recovering to 5-3 and this encounter had similar hallmarks.

City threatened to run riot even though they left Joe Hart, Yaya Toure, David Silva and James Milner to work on their fitness back at the club’s training base in New Jersey.

They went ahead after 12 minutes when Jesus Navas slipped the ball through to Jovetic in the right-hand channel. Former Chelsea defender Alex was painfully slow to react and Adil Rami could not get across in time to prevent the City forward steering the ball inside Michael Agazzi’s near post.

Sinclair doubled the lead two minutes later when Rami made a mess of dealing with Gael Clichy’s cross from the right, and he hooked the loose ball beyond Agazzi into the top corner.

Bruno Zuculini should have made it three when Aleksandar Kolarov’s cross found him unmarked in front of goal but the next was not long in coming as Navas attempted to meet Jovetic’s crossfield pass with an ambitious bicycle kick which took a deflection off Mattia De Sciglio and crept in at the near post.

Nigerian triallist Kelechi Iheanacho, still not sufficiently signed up to City’s books to warrant a name on the back of his shirt, then scored his second goal in as many games to make it 4-0.

There seemed little danger when the ball fell to the teenage striker on the edge of the area but he needed almost no backlift to send in a left-foot shot that Agazzi could only help on its way into the net.

A linesman’s flag chalked off an even better finish from Jovetic before Sulley Muntari pulled one back for Milan, tapping in at the far post from Bryan Cristante’s corner.

Half-time storms caused the restart to be held up by half an hour as players and fans sheltered from the lightning, which was perhaps appropriate given that Milan were preparing to introduce explosive striker Mario Balotelli off the bench against his old club.

Balotelli had the ball in the net within 10 minutes only to see it ruled out for offside but it was a more lively Milan in the second half who threatened to further reduce City’s lead.

However, Jovetic killed off any hopes of a comeback in the 58th minute with his second goal of the game.

There was still plenty of work to do when the Montenegrin met Kolarov’s low cross, and Jovetic dinked the ball past one defender with an exquisite touch of his right foot and despatched it into the net with his left.

Balotelli still almost stole the show in the last minute when two fans in AC Milan shirts invaded the pitch and race over to the striker. Balotelli could have overreacted but instead posed coolly for a photo with the pair before they are hauled away by stewards.
