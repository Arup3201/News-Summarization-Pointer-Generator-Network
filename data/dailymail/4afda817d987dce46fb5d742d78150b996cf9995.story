An ex-marine dressed in camouflage and armed with an AK-47 opened fire in a New Jersey Pathmark store this morning and fatally shot two co-workers - one of which was an 18-year-old girl who in a terrible twist of fate was covering a shift for a friend.

Police said 23-year-old Terence S. Tyler, argued with colleagues earlier on Friday morning, left the Old Bridge store for his car, returned around 4 a.m and killed Cristina Lobrutto and Bryan Green, 24, who were stacking shelves before the scheduled 6 a.m. opening.

Employees told police they saw Tyler coming towards the entrance of the popular supermarket with his guns and locked the door - but the shooter shot out two windows, walked inside and killed his co-workers and then himself.

Terence S. Tyler, 23, served in the U.S. Marines Corps. from 2008 to 2010, and most recently held the rank of lance corporal and was a rifleman

A neighbour of Cristina was left distraught by the death.

'Why does an 18-year-old have to lose her life,' said Carolyn Anders. 'Heart of gold, always smile on her face.'

The three dead had all been working the night shift at the Old Bridge Pathmark said Middlesex County Prosectuor Bruce Kaplan at a news conference on Friday.

One law enforcement official said that Tyler entered into an argument with unspecified other co-workers and at around 3.30 a.m. left the store, got into his car and drove away.

Kaplan said that approximately twenty minutes later he returned dressed in camouflage clothing and armed with an AK-47 and an automatic handgun and shot out two windows after staff locked the door to stop him entering when they saw him approach.

Entering into the store, Tyler reportedly shot at a group of five people standing in an aisle and hit and killed Lobrutto and Breen.

'We don't know what triggered it,' said Tyler's uncle, Christopher Dyson to NBC.Com.

Lobrutto, who turned 18 in May, started working at the Pathmark in June 2011, according to her Facebook page.

Kaplan said that at the moment police have no motive for the killings or Tyler's suicide.

Pathmark’s corporate owner issued a statement of sympathy to the victims and their relatives.

'We are terribly saddened by the 
incident at our Old Bridge Pathmark store this morning,' said the Great 
Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co.

'We express our deepest sympathies to the families of the victims and our appreciation to local law enforcement.'

The heavily armed staff member fired 
16 shots from the AK-47 as he killed Lobrutto and Breen.

'Two of the employees were shot and killed,' said Kaplan earlier this morning.

'The others were able to hide and escape.'

Heavily armed S.W.A.T. police swarmed to the Pathmark at around 4.30 a.m. but did not engage Tyler as he had already taken his own life by the time they arrived.

Tyler,
23, left the U.S. Marines Corp in 2010 and a military spokesman said 
that he held the rank of lance corporal and was a rifleman.

Before moving to New Jersey, Tyler lived in Brooklyn, but during his time in the Marine he was stationed in Palms, California.

Despite never serving overseas he received two medals, a Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and a National Defence Service Medal.

On his Facebook page, the ex-Marine posted the chilling words, 'Be Optimistic - All the people you hate are going to eventually die.'

Listed as graduating in 2007 from George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School in Brooklyn, his Facebook page declares his interests to be 'sports and hitting the gym'.

Masase Acheampong, 25, a friend of the gunman said that he was shocked by the shootings and that he was 'a normal kid'.

'That's why I am shocked, I would never have guessed it in a million years.'

When police arrived at the store which 
is 25-miles from New York City they moved the employees to a nearby 
T.G.I. Friday's where they were checked out by emergency workers.

'This is the worst phone call a mayor can receive,' said the mayor of Old Bridge Owen Henry. 

'You can prepare for these things but you can't prevent them.'

Mayor Henry confirmed the man left the store earlier in the morning and then returned wearing camouflage gear and brandishing an Ak-47 and an automatic pistol.

The mayor also said that the ex-marine's fatal wound was self-inflicted and he added that police were in the process of notifying the families of the victims.

The shooter may have had a history of depression or mental illness, a source told NBC.Com

Police said that they received a telephone call around 4.30 a.m. informing them that shots were being fired from inside the supermarket.

Witnesses inside said that there were around a dozen staff stacking shelves before opening.

Old Bridge is a bedroom suburb of about 65,000 about 25 miles from Manhattan but just across the Raritan Bay from Staten Island.

The incident comes just weeks after a series of mass shootings shook the
country.

In July, a gunman opened fire in a crowded Colorado movie 
theater and earlier this month a white supremacist opened fire in a Sikh
temple in Wisconsin.

And 
last week a disgruntled former employee shot his former boss on the 
streets of New York City before becoming involved in shoot-out with 
police that left nine bystanders injured.
