Veteran politician: Former barrister Ken Clarke's comments are likely to reignite the row over the veil

Muslim women should not wear the full-face veil in court because it is difficult to give evidence from inside ‘a kind of bag,’ Ken Clarke said yesterday.

The minister, a former barrister, believes women should wear what they want in public – but said the same rules could not apply if they were engaged in a ‘serious issue such as giving evidence’ as the veil could ‘undermine’ a trial.

Today he received the backing of the Prime Minister, who said institutions should be able to 'set and enforce' rules on dress.

Mr Clarke described the niqab, where only the woman’s eyes are visible, as a ‘most peculiar costume for the 21st century’ that left them ‘completely invisible’ to others.

Mr Clarke’s comments are likely to reignite the row over the veil, which was highlighted when a judge asked a Muslim woman to remove her veil to give evidence in a trial scheduled to begin this month.

At a plea hearing back in September, Judge Peter Murphy ruled that the 22-year-old woman – accused of intimidating a witness – would have to be seen by him, the jury and the lawyers if she was to give evidence.

The woman will be allowed to keep her face covered for the rest of the proceedings. But the judge said it was ‘crucial’ that the jury could see the defendant ‘for the purposes of evaluating’ her statement.

Veteran politician Mr Clarke, currently minister without portfolio, said: ‘I do think it’s a most peculiar costume for people to adopt in the 21st century.

‘But that’s not for me to decide when they’re not actually engaged in some serious issue such as giving evidence. That’s the bit which I think is almost impossible to have a proper trial if one of the persons is in a kind of bag.’

He added: ‘I was a barrister at the bar in criminal cases for about 15 years, and I don’t think a witness should be allowed to give evidence from behind a veil. The key thing a judge or a jury has to do is decide if someone is telling the truth.

‘The fact is we don’t know individually 
how each of us decides whether we trust somebody or believe they’re 
telling the truth when they tell us a story. It’s all because of body 
language and expression and how they do it,' he told BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend.

‘I can’t see how on earth
a judge and a jury can really appraise the evidence when you’re facing 
somebody who’s cloaked, and is completely invisible to you.’

Opinion: Mr Clarke described the wearing of the niqab (left), where only the woman's eyes are visible, as a 'most peculiar costume for the 21 century' that left them 'completely invisible' to others

And while he maintained that people 
should be able to wear ‘what the devil they like in public,’ he went on 
to say: ‘But giving evidence in a court of law on a serious issue of 
guilt or innocence, I think the jury and the judge have got to be able 
to see the face of the witness, judge their demeanour, and decide for 
themselves whether they’re going to rely on this evidence.

‘Maybe
there’ll have to be some sort of screening from the general public but I
actually think it undermines a trial, and that’s not based on any trace
of Islamophobia on my part, I don’t have that at all.’

Downing Street said David Cameron agreed with Mr Clarke. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'There is an important issue around dress codes and uniform policies in a number of institutions and it is very important that those institutions should be able to set and enforce them.

'For example, schools that have uniform policies. There may be cases at borders where it may be important to ascertain someone's identity'

Some people in Britain have called for the niqab to be banned in public as it is in France. There has also been heated debate over whether children should be compelled to wear it in school, where uniform policy is the responsibility of the head teacher.

Farooq Murad, from the Muslim Council of Britain, told the BBC’s Sunday Politics he did not believe adopting the full-face veil was a ‘requirement’ of Islam – explaining that only a small minority of Muslim women choose to wear them.

And Britain’s most senior Muslim politician, communities minister Baroness Warsi, said last week that a ban was ‘not the British way’ and called for a ‘common sense’ approach to the problem.
