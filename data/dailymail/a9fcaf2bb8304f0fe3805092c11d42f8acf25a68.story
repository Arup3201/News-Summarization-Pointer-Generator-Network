This weekend sees the switch to British Summer Time and, appropriately, it has been met with the first surprise heatwave of the year.

Far from the usual case of it being summer time in name only, Britain will today bask in temperatures up to 10C higher than the seasonal average, forecasters said.

The heatwave is expected to hit the south hardest, with predicted maximum temperatures of 21C (69.8F) in Berkshire, Surrey and Hampshire.

Yesterday was the warmest day of the 
year so far with the mercury reaching 21.3C (70.3F) in Charlwood, 
Surrey. And in London the weather was so warm it spurred an air quality 
alert, with pollution measuring at nine on the ten-point scale.

The warm weather is being caused by a 
high pressure system in the North Sea which is sucking warm air from in 
from France and northern Continental Europe. For the next few days London is 
expected to be warmer than typically sun-soaked capitals much further 
south like Madrid, Rome and even Athens.

But
although the temperatures are unseasonal, they won’t make the record 
books. The hottest March day was 25.6c (78f) at Mepal in Cambridgeshire 
on March 29, 1968. Paul Mott, forecaster at MeteoGroup, 
the weather division of the Press Association, said that temperatures 
will be well in excess of expectations for this time of year.

'There will be plenty of warm sunshine for most areas of the UK, and the highest temperatures will be around 20-21C.

'Across much of the UK temperatures will generally be around 15-19C. We're up to 10C above the seasonal average.'

Mr Mott said the highest temperatures tomorrow will be in Aberdeenshire, which is expected to reach 20C (68F). It will be less warm in southern England, but still around 18C (64.4F).

The pleasant conditions caused by high
pressure are expected to continue into next week, with no significant 
drop in temperatures until next weekend.

'It's looking fine and warm for much 
of the coming week,' Mr Mott said. 'It will last until until at least 
Thursday or Friday and will probably be milder next weekend.'

He described the current spell of warm
weather as 'quite unusual' for March, and warned there was no 
significant rainfall in the drought-affected areas of southern England.

Helen Chivers, a meteorologist at the Met Office, also said that the unseasonal weather would continue into next week.

'We are expecting the warm weather to 
carry on into the weekend and next week. We may well see a change 
towards the end of next week with things becoming cooler, but it is 
quite a long way out for us to say for definite that this will be the 
case,' she said.

Meanwhile the gardeners at Cornish 
National Trust mansion Cotehele are celebrating as the peak blossom time
of their daffodils has coincided with their annual weekend celebrating 
the plant.

A spokesman said it is the first time in four years they have got their timing perfect for the two-day event.

'It will be a fantastic chance for 
garden lovers and families to see our wonderful collection of historic 
daffodils, including some varieties which are 200 years old,' said 
senior gardener Aimee Kingdom. The gardens are open from 11am to 4pm.

Yesterday the Woodland Trust asked 
people to look out for the first bluebells of the year as it tracks the 
blooming of wildflowers across the UK.

The charity said that just over 50 
sightings have been reported so far - almost twice as many as were 
called in at this time last year.

But don’t get too used to the good weather – last year’s warm spring was followed by a washout summer. The
dry conditions also spell further difficulties for water companies, which 
fear a prolonged drought and have already warned of hosepipe bans.

The Environment Agency said: ‘It’s 
been the driest March since records began in 1910 and it’s not looking 
likely that we’ll have enough rain to avoid a widespread drought this 
summer.

‘We’re working with
farmers to keep them going through the summer and we have new 
regulations to produce environmental sites like wetlands. It’s our job 
to make sure everybody gets water and the environment is protected. It’s
been a very, very dry week and river levels are continuing to decrease.

‘Obviously, it’s nice to have a sunny weekend but what we really need at the moment is a prolonged period of rainfall.

‘On
hot weekends, we should all try to use less water. If we all can use a 
little less, we can make the most of what we have.’

you don't fancy heading to the beach, here is a selection of other 
events happening this weekend to make the most of the great weather:

But spare a thought for....

The villagers of Collingbourne Ducis.

Due
to the extraordinarily dry weather, they have seen the river through 
their village run dry, forcing the cancellation of their annual duck 
race.

It’s the second year running that the race for scores of 
yellow plastic ducks has been called off because there’s no river for 
them to float on. Organiser Lindie Rogers said 'It a real shame because people look forward to the race.'

It was meant to take place at the end of February, but it seems there's no hope of it being rescheduled any time soon.
