A network of disused underground tunnels, that were once used to transport post across London, have been given the go-ahead to open as a tourist attraction.

Mail Rail first opened in 1927 and in its heyday used a series of driverless trains to transport post beneath the capital's streets from the East End's Whitechapel to Paddington in the west.

Undiscovered: The public have never before been allowed into the 'secret' tunnels that were used by the Post Office to distribute mail across London

Long forgotten: Old Tube stations and secret tunnels have long intrigued visitors to London, so the abandoned Mail Rail is expected to attract a lot of attention

Mothballed: The Post Office Railway currently lies disused under the streets of London after the network of tunnels were abandoned in favour of road transport in 2003

Islington Council has approved plans to allow tourists to descend beneath the city and ride the trains that sit below some of the London's most iconic sights.

From 2020, visitors will be able to ride the 'secret Tube', departing from Mount Pleasant, in Islington, which was once one of the largest sorting offices in the world.

The original track was 6.5 miles long and had a total of eight stations and at some stages narrowed to just 7ft wide. Tourists will ride the miniature trains for a total of 0.6miles, while learning about the history of the Post Office.

A world apart: More than 100 years ago the tunnels were approved for use by the Rail Mail trains, but they were abandoned in 2003

Deeper underground: The miniature trains travelled more than 6 miles across London, with eight designated stops, passing below Oxford Street and just feet away from the Bakerloo Line

Ray Middlesworth, an engineer who has worked in the tunnels, said: 'It's the holy grail for underground explorers - a hidden part of the rail network. Some people called it the Post Office's best-kept secret.'

Adrian Steel, director of the British Postal Museum and Archive, added: 'It is a fantastic opportunity that 
Islington borough council has given us - the green light to open up 
these unique tunnels to the public and reveal the captivating story of 
Mail Rail.'

See the sights: The development of the 'secret Tube' into a tourist attraction will combine with the opening of a special museum devoted to the history of Britain's postal service

Bright future: The train, which will travel 0.6miles under London, will open in 2020 and will explore the history of the tunnels

A new postal museum will also open on the Mount Pleasant site in 2016, displaying artefacts from British postal history, including telegrams from the Titanic, original evidence from the Great Train Robbery trial and pistols used to defend mail coaches in the 19th Century.

The British Postal Museum & Archive (BPMA) still needs to raise £0.5million and will be launching a public appeal later in the year. It is also waiting to hear the outcome of an application for £4.5million 
from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

The Mail Rail was finally closed in 2003, after Royal Mail built a new hub in Willesden, west London and it was decided it would be cheaper to transport mail by road instead of using the tunnels.
