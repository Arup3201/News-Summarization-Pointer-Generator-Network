He is the former face of a website which advertises competitive car insurance quotes.

But comedian Omid Djalili was banned from driving yesterday - for driving without valid insurance.

Djalili was fined £2,900 and banned from driving for six months after he drove his moped uninsured and with an expired licence.

But he claimed he had 'no idea' that he had 12 penalty points on his licence, rendering his insurance for the vehicle invalid.

Banned: Despite advertising car insurance quotes, Omid Djalili was fined £2,900 and banned from driving for six months after he drove his moped uninsured

The actor, who has featured in a 
Moneysupermarket.com advert promoting car insurance price comparisons, 
has clocked up thirty-six penalty points for driving offences.

He also owes approximately another £3,000 in fines and court costs he claims to know nothing about.

Gladiator and Pirates of the Caribbean star Djalili, 46, of East Sheen, London, argued he needed to keep his licence to avoid fanatics, who have issued death threats, and abusive passengers on public transport.

The father-of-three denied, but was convicted at City of London Magistrates’ Court, of riding his Piaggio MP3 without insurance and not in accordance with a licence in Grosvenor Road, Pimlico on May 4.

He was fined £2,000, given six penalty points for driving without insurance and fined £700 for the licence offence and ordered to pay £600 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.

Djalili admitted illegally riding his moped in a cycle-only superhighway lane while travelling to the Vaudeville Theatre, where he was starring in Joe Orton’s ‘What The Butler Saw’ and was fined an additional £200.

Police Sergeant Simon Rhodes told the court: 'I was drawn to the speed, which I deemed to be over thirty miles per hour. The vehicle then pulled into the cycle lane and undertook six vehicles.'

The officer impounded the scooter because Djalili’s licence had passed the twelve penalty point threshold, rendering his insurance invalid, and it took the entertainer two weeks to get it back.

'I had absolutely no idea I had these points on my licence, I never received anything', Djalili told the court.

Omid said he had 'no idea' that he had 12 points on his licence making his insurance invalid

'Maybe I was on tour at the time doing stand-up comedy. I have never received anything about these court cases.'

Djalili has five previous offences of failing to inform who was in charge of his Lexus car and Piaggio moped when caught on London traffic cameras either speeding, jumping red lights or breaching other road laws.

'These points will be contested and I am in the process of appealing,' said Djalili, who has instructed celebrity law firm Freeman and Co.

Claiming any disqualification would cause him ‘exceptional hardship’ he told the court: 'I have found myself being harassed and recognised on public transport.

'If I don’t stop and take a picture with someone it can get abusive, which is distressing.

'I also suffer terrible nausea on tour buses and let my crew go ahead and I follow in my car and my wife has a nervous disorder, which prevents her driving.'

Chelsea-born Djalili, whose parents are Iranian, added: 'There is also a security issue. Coming from the Middle East and not being a muslim I’ve had death threats and have always felt more secure when I am driving.'

In 2009 it was revealed a car insurer which had a £25 million advertising campaign starring veteran rocker Iggy Pop refused to insure musicians.

In the Swiftcover TV advertisements, 61-year-old Iggy prances around topless as he boasts: 'I got it Swiftcovered. I got insurance on my insurance. Do it. Get a life. Get Swiftcovered.'

But musicians who applied for cover were told their occupation made them ineligible.
