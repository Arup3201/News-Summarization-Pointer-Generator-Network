Gauges in tank at Plymouth University measured water motion and sent electronic signals to a synthesizer which created the Orchestra Of Waves

A composer dubbed 'King Canute' has today become the first in the world to perform music created by waves - in a swimming pool.

Dr Alexis Kirke transformed his body into a 'giant baton' by covering himself with motion sensors that controlled the water in a massive wave tank at the University of Plymouth, Devon.

The more he moved his arms, the louder and more intense the music became - just like a normal conductor.

Dr Kirke, 42, used the sensors on his arms to manipulate the number and size of waves created by 24 giant paddles in the pool.

Dr Alexis Kirke performed his pioneering piece of music at Plymouth University in Devon by controlling waves in a massive water tank

His movements controlled waves in the tank and gauges in the water then measured the water’s movements.

The gauges sent electronic signals to a synthesizer which created the music, which vaguely resembled whale song.

Raising his arms changed the pitch of the sound while joysticks also enabled him to change the volume.

Dr Kirke’s Orchestra Of Waves was watched by hundreds of people at the university.

It was performed after the Duke of 
Edinburgh opened the university’s new £19million Marine Building, 
which contains the 35m by 15m tank.

Dr Kirke has put together the 12-minute show with co-composer Samuel Freeman,

Dr Kirke said: 'I told him I wanted to be like King Canute, controlling the waves.

'The show went very well and people in the audience were asking whether they could buy the music.

'You are in a building and hear the noise of the waves and the smell and see them crashing down.

'There’s no way of explaining what it’s like to have dramatic sounds synchronized with that.'

The pool also contained a special buoy which made a sound like a deep bell ringing when hit by a wave.

The more the waves struck it, the more times the bells rang. Four students joined in with drumming.

Foolish or wise? An illustration showing King Canute on his throne at the sea shore

Canute, the second son of King Sweyn of Denmark, became King of England in 1017.

An effective ruler, he created a unified system of government and abolished the Danegeld tax, which had seen English kings pay a tax to Danish lords to prevent them from pillaging across England.

However, he is best remembered for his association with trying to turn back the tide.

It is said that his courtiers flattered him into believing he had the power to make the sea recede.

Some say that he then took his throne down to the shore and tried in vain to command the waves, until he nearly drowned.

Others suggest that he put on the futile demonstration to show his courtiers he was no fool - and thus put an end to their senseless talk.

Canute died in 1035 and was buried in Winchester.
