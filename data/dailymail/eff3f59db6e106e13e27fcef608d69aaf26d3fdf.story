An army veteran whose pregnant wife allegedly sent ricin-laced letters to President Obama and then told authorities her husband was to blame has suggested she carried out the plot to become famous.

Nathaniel Richardson said that although he and his wife Shannon were having problems, he had no idea she was capable of such a plan, which had felt 'like a bad dream'.

'She really wanted to be an actress,' he told ABC News. 'She wanted to get her face out there.'

Shannon Richardson, who remains in jail charged with mailing a threatening communication to the president, has had small parts in shows including The Walking Dead and The Vampire Diaries.

Heartbroken: Nathaniel Richardson said learning his pregnant wife, Shannon Richardson, allegedly framed him for sending poison letters to President Obama was like a 'bad dream'

Speaking out: Richardson and his lawyer chat to Savannah Guthrie about the case on the Today show

She initially contacted the FBI claiming that her husband was behind the poisoned letters sent to Obama, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and his gun control lobby in Washington.

She told investigators she found a suspicious substance in their refrigerator as well as addresses for Bloomberg and Obama written on a note on his desk.

But after she failed a polygraph test and authorities found inconsistencies in her story, she was arrested on June 7 at their home in New Boston, Texas. She could face 10 years in federal prison if found guilty.

Shannon has five children, aged four to 19, from other relationships and is now pregnant with Mr Richardson's child.

Plot: He suggested she implicated him as she wanted to be an actress and it would 'get her face out there'

Mr Richardson, who filed for divorce after he was allegedly framed but before his wife was arrested, revealed his shock at discovering she had tried to implicate him.

'It was kind of like disbelief, or it was like a bad dream,' he told the Today show. 'The person she was wasn't real.'

Arrest: He filed for divorce from his wife before her arrest on June 7 in connection with the letters

But he vowed that he would not waste his time being angry at his wife, whom he married in 2011.

'She has done this to herself,' he told ABC. 'She has destroyed my reputation and my life but there's a way up from this and if I sit here and focus on anger, I can't focus on getting on with my life.'

He insisted he had no part in the plot, and did not even know what ricin was before he was accused of sending the three letters. 'I was calling it licin,' he said.

An affidavit said that Richardson finally admitted to receiving syringes and chemicals needed for ricin production in the mail, as well as printing labels for the letters and mailing them.

However, she said that her husband had 'made her' send the letters, according to the affidavit.

The letters were received last month and contained anti-gun law messages that stated: 'You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns.

'Anyone who wants to come to my house
 will get shot in the face. The right to bear arms is my constitutional,
 God-given right and I will exercise that right till the day I die.

'What’s in this letter is nothing compared to what I’ve got planned for you.'

Led away: She was taken into custody on June 7 after admitting to sending the three ricin-laced letters

Richardson claimed that her husband was behind the plot as he is a well known bigot.

'He’s racist and hates Obama. Everyone knows that,' she said to the New York Post denying any claims that she was to blame.

The letter to the president was received at a mail screening facility and did not reach the White House. One of the letters sent to Bloomberg was retrieved at the City Hall, and the second arrived at the headquarters of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which Bloomberg operates and personally finances.

Shannon Richardson's attorney told ABC: 'I have seen no evidence to even suggest that my client desired to hurt the president or any of the other individuals involved.'
