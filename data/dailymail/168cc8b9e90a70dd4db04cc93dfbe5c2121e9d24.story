Tad Jeremy Costin is accused of assaulting 15 young girls over more than 20 years

A Texas man has been arrested after allegedly assaulting at least 15 young girls aged under seven-years-old.

Police arrested Tad Jeremy Costin after computer memory cards containing hundreds of images of child pornography were found in boxes at his former home in Dayton.

Investigators then allegedly found six hard drives and 80 CDs containing further abuse pictures at his address in Pearland.

Detectives say pictures included ones of him assaulting young children.

He was arrested at 11pm on Friday and was charged with sexual assault of a child.

Police believe there are 15 victims who have not been identified and say they are not related to Costin.

They said some of the pictures could date back as far as 1990.

Harris
County Assistant District Attorney Kathryn Kahle told KHOU that the 
children appeared unresponsive in the pictures and may have been 
drugged.

She said: 'They are dressed in what appear to be nightgowns, little girl nightgowns.

'Some of them look as if they are unresponsive and/or drugged when they are engaged in those sexual acts.'

Deputies said Costin has previously been arrested for similar offences.

He is currently being held in the Harris County jail.

Costin was arrested after boxes containing memory cards filled with child pornography was found at his old home

Kahle said Harris County's Crimes Against Children Task Force's 'upmost priority' is to identify the children in the images.

Costin only moved to Pearland in the past few months and shared a home with his girlfriend and her five-year-old son.

Neighbors said he they were wary of Costin and refused to take their children to a pool party he hosted.

He is being held without bond.
