The battle of Waterloo was especially bloody. As one British rifleman who survived it said: ‘I had never heard of a battle in which everyone was killed, but this seemed likely to be an exception.’

Blinded by smoke and terrified by the slaughter, 200,000 men fought it out in an area of little more than two square miles. Men ‘were going down like ninepins’, observed the Duke of Wellington as the bodies of British lay piled in the defensive squares where they had stood.

Corpses of French cavalrymen and their horses lay in mounds nearby.

History is about change, and Waterloo changed everything. For this reason alone, we must celebrate its 200th anniversary next year

Despite — or perhaps because of — the carnage, Waterloo changed the course of British and European history decisively. It was the battle on June 18, 1815 when an Allied army under the Duke of Wellington broke the back of Napoleon’s army, which was then swept from the battlefield by Marshal Blucher’s Prussians.

The French dictator escaped on what was the first stage of a flight that would end at St Helena in the South Atlantic, where he brooded sourly in exile over his past glories and wondered what had gone wrong.

For France and the rest of Europe, his defeat marked the end of over 20 years of war that had devastated the Continent as he tried to subjugate it to his despotic rule.

From Moscow to Madrid, there were ruined cities, towns and villages; hundreds of thousands had died in battle and from the epidemics spread by diseased soldiers; and there had been famines caused by plundering armies that lived off the land.

Forget the glamourous uniforms of the fighting men, the Napoleonic wars had been a mass human catastrophe.

And Waterloo brought them to an end — ushering in nearly 40 years of peace and reconstruction for Europe and marking the beginning of the ‘British century’, a time of industrial innovation and growth, expansion overseas and maritime supremacy.

Britannia ruled the waves and Britain became the ‘workshop of the world’ as well as its banker.

History is about change, and Waterloo changed everything. For this reason alone, we must celebrate its 200th anniversary next year in the same way as we are celebrating, though ruefully, the anniversaries of World War I.

Yet the deliverance and remaking of Europe are deemed of little account at the Department for Education.

What happened at Waterloo appears a matter of indifference to the department’s Secretary of State Nicky Morgan, who recently spurned requests to discuss how the battle might be commemorated in schools.

Perhaps the snub was provoked by the National Union of Teachers’ tendency, a body of drab, glum folk who are hostile to anything that may smack of patriotism.

They are repelled by history that includes flashing sabres — particularly if it involves a battle won by a Tory aristocrat in the Iron Duke, who opposed parliamentary reform.

Flourish

To them, the history of the industrial working class is infinitely preferable — as long as it does not embrace those working men who wore a red coat and went to war led by Old Etonian officers.

Yet this is a dismally myopic view. The Napoleonic wars gave huge impetus to the Industrial Revolution: steam engines powered the machines that made the ropes for Nelson’s battleships and Congreve artillery rockets were mass-produced in factories.

And their conclusion allowed British industry to flourish across the globe.

The Victorians who reaped the rewards of Waterloo understood this, which is why prints of dramatic scenes from the battle hung in thousands of drawing rooms and why Wellington received a magnificent state funeral.

Scottish, Irish and Welsh soldiers held the line at Waterloo. Some were volunteers, but many enlisted out of poverty, desperation or a chance to blow the bounty money they earned in battle on beer and brandy.

The history of Waterloo and the war it ended offers a wonderful opportunity for pupils of all ages to connect with the past. Soldiers kept diaries, wrote letters or, if they survived, simply remembered what they had seen and done.

And in this way ordinary soldiers discovered a voice as never before. A voice that gives them a harsh, vivid and even comic reality.

Their stories are abundant and breathe life into history. A Rifleman Harris remembers how his fellow recruits merrily staggered from pub to pub to their barracks, where they quickly learned drunkenness would earn a flogging.

Another rifleman with a reputation as a marksman is offered a guinea by a colonel for picking off a French general and gets a further guinea for hitting the general’s aide-de-camp. Soon after he is found drunk, having spent his reward on brandy, and is duly flogged.

There are tales of how humanity and decency emerged during the horrors of war. A one-armed British cavalry officer recalled how he was attacked by a French cuirassier during a melee at Waterloo. His opponent saw his empty sleeve, lowered his sabre, saluted him and rode on.

And there are stories of pure courage: the bloody-minded sort is exemplified by Trooper Shaw of the Life Guards, a former prize fighter, who drank well before Waterloo, cut down a dozen lancers, then fell from his horse in an alcoholic stupor.

These were also women’s wars. Many followed their husbands into battle, acting as nurses, washerwomen and cooks. Private Wheeler of the 51st recalled seeing ‘a lovely young woman, supporting the head of her dying husband’, and hearing of another who had got through a dozen husbands during the campaign.

Destiny

Their men died in a brutal, all-consuming world war that ended only with Waterloo, its battles spread across the globe as France fought to extend and consolidate its empire.

And the prime reason for this was the megalomania of one man, Napoleon, who imagined it his destiny to make France empress of Europe.

Next year’s restaging of Waterloo on the actual battlefield is set to feature more than 6,000 re-enactors

Despite the destruction by Nelson of his battle fleet at Trafalgar in 1805, he refused to give up, waging war through the Spanish peninsula and then turning his guns East. In 1812, Napoleon thought he could bend Russia to his will and led half a million men to Moscow. He suffered a crushing defeat thanks to the determination of Tzar Alexander I and the patriotism of the Russian people.

But even this did not lessen his hubris. Only at Waterloo was he seen off for good.

The power politics of the Napoleonic era are full of lessons for today’s pupils.

How and why does a man such as Napoleon convince himself and others that he has the power to change history?

Sacrifice

Why did Frenchmen die at Waterloo shouting ‘Vive L’Empereur’ when all was lost?

Was Wellington right to believe it was a prime duty of generals to win battles with as few casualties as possible — and given the carnage all around him, did he succeed?

After the battle, many soldiers were so deafened by cannon fire that they were spared the shrieks of dying men and horses.

There was another sound, almost more horrible — a constant chink, chink, chink. It was the noise of battlefield scavengers removing the teeth of dead soldiers, which would be sold to dentists in Britain to be made into dentures.

‘Waterloo teeth’ were much in demand for years to come because they came from young and healthy men — countless numbers of them British men who had died ridding Europe of a dictator whose downfall changed Europe’s fate beyond recognition.

Surely our nation’s children should be told about their sacrifice and this extraordinary battle — in all its gory, brilliant and utterly compelling detail.
