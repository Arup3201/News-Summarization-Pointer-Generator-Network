Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has addressed his controversial comments towards 'Chinese mongrels' and 'Chinese b***ards' by insisting 'they were not directed at the Chinese community or the Chinese government'.

After receiving backlash for his bizarre rant on ABC's Q&A program on Monday night, Mr Palmer today issued a statement saying he has 'been an admirer of China and its people for many years', going on to mention the Party's first mainland born Chinese Senator Dio Wang.

The Palmer United Party leader reiterated his support for China, but made clear his comments were directed against Citic Pacific, with whom he's locked in a series of legal disputes.

Mr Palmer maintained his stance against Citic, who he has accused of abusing and undermining Australia's legal system for 'commercial gain'.

Australia's Palmer United Party leader was on the panel of ABC television programme Q&A on Monday night when he hit out with the racist comments

'We cannot encourage foreign labour within Australian jurisdiction to be paid lesser amounts than what is lawful in this country,' he said.

'No amount of money, no amount of lobbying should blind us from the duty to protect.'

Despite vowing his support for China, Mr Palmer earlier said it would be a while before he visited the country, quipping: 'If I went they'd shoot me'.

A social media storm forced Mr Palmer yesterday to publicly clarify his comments, while his eccentric colleague senator Jacqui Lambie weighed in with a bizarre written statement warning of a 'Chinese communist invasion'.

She also went on radio repeating calls for Australia to double its investment in military and missile defence system, or else risk 'letting our grandchildren become slaves'.

Mr Palmer has again tried to clarify his position, telling the Australian Financial Review that while he wasn't talking about the Chinese people, from his point of view there is 'no distinction' between Citic and the government.

Citic has accused Mr Palmer of using $12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013.

Mr Palmer's comments may have sparked diplomatic tension between Australia and China, who described his tirade as 'absurd and irresponsible', the AFR reports.

And in an attempt to smooth things over, foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Chinese embassy that 'these were the comments of one Member of Parliament and not representative'.

Clive Palmer's comments come as he is locked in a legal battle with Chinese-owned Citic Pacific over a series of disputes.

The first concerns a bank account operated by Mr Palmer's company Mineralogy, for which Mr Palmer was the only signatory of the account at the time of the incident.

Citic claims that the account was only to be used for covering the operational costs of Port Preston, an iron ore port in Western Australia.

Two cheques were spent from this account in 2013, one for $10 million that went to Mr Palmer's Cosmo Development and a $2.17 million check that went to the PR firm Media Circus.

Citic has accused Mr Palmer of using the $12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013.

On Monday's episode of Q&A Tony Jones tried to get Mr Palmer to admit whether or not he had spent any money from the Mineralogy-operated account on his election campaign.

One of Mr Palmer's companies, Queensland Nickel, put $12.7 million back into the account after media accounts of the incident first emerged.

There is an ongoing dispute between Palmer's Mineralogy and Citic about the Sino Iron Project. The dispute concerns royalties for the project, with Mr Palmer claiming he is owed $500 million.

Mr Palmer was on the panel of the ABC's flagship programme when he launched into a tirade about Chinese business interests in Australia, accusing Chinese people of trying to take over Australia

'The Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free. So far they've shifted $200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it. I don't mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stop them from doing it,' he said.

The controversial MP made the comments when he was being questioned by host Tony Jones about allegations he used money from one of his business accounts to fund his election campaign.

Mr Palmer repeatedly refused to answer Mr Jones's questions, saying he would be answering them in court this week and would not be subjected to a 'trial by media'.

He then claimed he was owed 'about $500 million by the Communist Chinese government.'

'We'll be suing them and they'll be answering the questions. We've had... an arbitration against these Chinese mongrels - I'm saying that because they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them,' he said.

Outraged Q&A viewers took to social media and expressed their disgusts over the mining billionaire's derogatory views.

Activist group GetUp! tweeted: 'Hey, that was pretty racist @CliveFPalmer, and that's not okay'.

'To say what Clive Palmer just said on #qanda. I'm surprised if that's legal. Or free speech absolute in Oz?' Peter Johansson tweeted.

'I love how @clivefpalmer is celebrating Australia's cultural diversity in an anger racist Palmer kind of way,' Raphael tweeted.

Silas Palmer wrote: 'Was that [the snarling, racist and ruthless] the Real Clive Palmer'.

'Dear @JulieBishopMP , If you need help with your portfolio perhaps @CliveFPalmer may help with a diplomatic mission to China,' tweeted Viscount Mike OBE.

Some expressed support for Mr Palmer, with Raiderette tweeting: 'Good on ya Clive keep speaking freely!' and Michael Brown writing: 'Fair enough Clive.'

The 56-year-old was on the panel for the weekly Australian talk show hosted by Tony Jones.

Other panellists were deputy prime minister Warren Truss, opposition leader in the senate Penny Wong, businesswoman and RBA board member Heather Ridout, national CEO of St Vincent de Paul Society John Falzon.

In 2009, Clive Palmer criticised the Labor government's trade policies, which made trade more difficult for Chinese investors than U.S. investors.

In an address to the Queensland Media Club he called the current policies 'racist' and said there was 'a great cry in Australia about Reds under the bed'.

But Mr Palmer argued that 'capital is now in China, it's not in the US' and that Australia had a terrific opportunity to become a strong trade partner with China 'if our politicians could only be fair and treat the Chinese people and Chinese government with the dignity they deserve.'
