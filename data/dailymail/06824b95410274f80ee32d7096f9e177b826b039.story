She's Britain's strongest schoolgirl, with three British powerlifting titles under her belt.

And now Bronwyn Taylor, 16, from Inverness in Scotland, has revealed the gut-busting diet she follows to in a bid to become a world class champion.

The teenager consumes 2,300 calories per day, making her way through 14 eggs, two dozen bowls of porridge, 14 tins 
of tuna, and mountains of muesli and cheese every week.

Healthy diet: Bronwyn with some of the food that makes up her daily six meals a day

She had initially planned on becoming a 
hairdresser, but after taking up powerlifting a year ago her athletic 
potential went from strength to strength.

Just 12 months after taking up the 
sport, Bronwyn  - who is 5 
feet 10 ins and weighs 11 stone 4lb - has stunned her friends and family by breaking three 
British records at the Commonwealth Powerlifting Federation 
Championships, lifting twice her own body weight.

The fifth year student is now gearing up for the World Bench Press 
Championships which take place next month, three days after her final English exam.

She said: 'I do eat a lot of food but I’m not a calorie counter because it is all very healthy.

Packing some punch: Bronwyn Taylor, Britain's strongest schoolgirl, only took up powerlifting a year ago

'My friends at school thought it was a 
little strange at first but now they are used to it. They think they will end up looking like the Incredible Hulk.'

Bronwyn was inspired to take up powerlifting - which uses a different 
technique to weightlifting - while training in boxing and karate in 
December 2010.

She began to hit the gym with her dad 
Andrew, 43, who runs a removals firm, and with his help quickly 
discovered her talent for the sport.

Meal 1 - 7am - Bowl of porridge and 2 hard boiled egg whites

Meal 2 - mid morning school snack - Tin of tuna and brown rice from the school canteen

Meal 3 - lunch - chicken breast, broccoli, green beans and some fruit

Meal 4 - mid afternoon - tin of tuna and oatcakes, sugar free jelly

Meal 5 - dinner - white fish with salad and a baked potato

Meal 6 - just before bed - diet hot chocolate and sugar free muesli

She broke the Scottish record in 
October by lifting a combined weight of 260 kilograms (40 st 13lbs) at 
the Scottish Open championships in Glasgow.

The record did not count as a British record because it was not completed at the British competition.

Both her British and Scottish 
record-breaking weights are compiled from three lifts, the bench press, 
the deadlift and the squat, standard practice for measuring record 
attempts in the sport.

As well as taking on her first 
international contest she also plans to turn her hand to the Olympic 
sport of weightlifting to compete in the 2016 games.

Bronwyn’s mother Florence added: 'The whole aim is to improve. I stock the fridge up once a week and she eats what she wants to eat.

'She needs the energy because in the 
international competition she will be up against girls who are almost 
two years older than her but I am optimistic she can do it.

“I have never scrimped on food and as a 
family we eat quite a lot because Bronwyn’s dad is very active at the 
gym and her younger brother Cosmo, who is 12, is starting to get into it
as well.'

The World Bench Press Championships will take place between May 21 and May 26 in the Czech Republic.
