Liverpool and Arsenal's 2-2 draw was evidence that the Premier League is a fading force in European football, according to Gary Neville.

The game at Anfield was ridden with defensive errors and profligacy in front of goal, with the unmarked Martin Skrtel eventually heading an equaliser in for the hosts deep into injury time.

And Sky Sports pundit Neville, speaking on Monday Night Football, slammed both sides for lacking balance and intensity, insisting championships were a 'long, long way away'.

The former Manchester United defender also highlighted the contrast of the display to Atletico Madrid's impressive 4-1 win against Athletic Bilbao.

'I was immensely disappointed with the game. I didn't enjoy it,' he said ahead of Chelsea's match against Stoke at the Britannia Stadium. 'There isn't intensity to stop opposition playing. 

'Atletico Madrid - there's a team that resemble a top side. We've really dropped below this level of intensity.

'Chelsea have got it, City have a bit, but Liverpool's games with Arsenal and United were a million miles away from being big games.'

Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher joined Neville on the programme, and believed his former side Liverpool were returning to their form from last season in the match.

But his colleague, who focused on Arsenal's 'terrible' midfield and in particular Mathieu Flamini, said just playing good football wasn't enough for the top teams.

'We're brainwashed into thinking either/or - technical or horrible to play against. But you're not going to win the league with just technical players.

'Barcelona are exception to the rule, that's not real. That's not going to happen. You must have a team of balance. 

'In the game at Old Trafford [Man United 3-0 Liverpool] and yesterday, there were too many attempts at goal. Balance has gone too far in one way. 

'Get that back, then we'll be back to three or four teams back in the Champions League semi-finals.'
