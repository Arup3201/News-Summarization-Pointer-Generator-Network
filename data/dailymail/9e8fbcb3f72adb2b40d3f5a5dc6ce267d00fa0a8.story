A stroke victim was forced to wait an hour for an ambulance because staff were on a 'meal break'.

Carl Brown, 47, found his retired cook mum Pauline slumped in her chair when he returned to their Liverpool home.

He rushed to get his sister-in-law who lived four doors down before making the first 999 call.

But an hour lapsed before a crew finally arrived at the family home with  the driver admitting managers had forced them to take a break.

Anguish: Retired cook Pauline Brown agonising hour wait for ambulance after suffering stroke

The delay came despite a high profile government TV advertising campaign entitled Act F.A.S.T which set out the symptoms of a stroke and the need to seek prompt medical attention.

Carl said: 'We’ve all seen the adverts that say "act fast after a stroke," but we had to wait an hour for the ambulance.

'The driver said to me "this is unofficial but we saw your mum’s job pop up on our screens, but we were told you’ve got to have your 20 minute break."

'I just think people should know this, it’s appalling.'

Wavertree MP Luciana Berger said the
situation 'beggars belief' adding: 'The ambulance service have got very
serious questions to answer.'

Launching an investigation the North West Ambulance Service apologised for the distress caused to the family by the wait.

A spokesperson added: 'In line with health & safety regulations, staff are required to take a meal/rest break during their shift.

'This rest break is necessary to ensure the welfare of our staff in what is both a physical and demanding job.

'These breaks are staggered so that there is minimal effect on the resource levels.

'We offer our most sincere apologies for 
any distress that may have been caused for this patient and their 
family, whilst waiting for an ambulance.'

Angry: Son Carl Brown helpless for an hour as waited for 999 crew

Mrs Brown suffered the stroke 12 days ago when Paul returned to the home in Stonebill Road, Old Swan, on September 14.

The first 999 call was made at 5.16pm as other family members and neighbours rushed around to help while the emergency operator gave instructions down the phone on what to do.

When help finally arrived, his mum was rushed to hospital and later transferred to Broadgreen Hospital.

Describing the lasting effects caused by the stroke he said she could answer ‘yes’ to some questions.

But he added: 'She’s not going to get any better and her quality of life is not going to improve.

'She paid her taxes all her life and should have had an ambulance when she needed it.'

999: Paramedic ambulance crew taking a patient on a stretcher into hospital.

Around 150,000 people across the UK suffer a stroke each year which disrupts the flow of blood to the brain.

The government's advertising campaign to raise awareness of getting help to stroke victims quickly was launched under the banner Face, Arms, Speech and Time.

It asks 'has their face fallen on one side? Can they smile? Can they raise both arms and keep them there? Is their speech slurred? Time to call 999 if you see any single one of these signs.'
