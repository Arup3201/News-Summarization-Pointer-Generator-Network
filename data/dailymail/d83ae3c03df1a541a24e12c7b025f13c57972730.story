Do you automatically cut your sandwiches into triangles, get tiddly on one glass of wine and use words like 'sugar' and 'fudge' instead of their four-letter counterparts?

You must be a mum.

According to a new survey, the top 50 signs that you're a mother include hilarious giveaways such as buying gallons of milk, always having wet wipes to hand and knowing the words to Let It Go.

Gallons of milk in your shopping? Cutting sandwiches into triangles? You must be a mum

They also yearn for a lie in, have photos of their children as a screensaver and have learnt how to swear under their breath.

Mothers are permanently tired and wired, rushing everywhere and can only find time to watch television on  catch-up or Sky Plus.

You'll also find a cabinet dedicated to medicines in a mother's home and a massive family organiser on the wall.

The findings emerged in a study of 2,000 mothers, which looked at the tell-tale signs of someone who has clearly had children. 

They're also able to sleep clinging to the edge of the bed because their child is sleeping horizontally beside them.

They also find it almost impossible to leave the house without asking everyone if they have been to the toilet.

Comfort becomes a higher priority over fashion too, as further signs of motherhood included finding bigger pants more comfortable and owning a selection of comfy shoes.

The exclamations 'sugar' and 'fudge' are more common ways for mothers to curse, and sandwiches start to always be cut into triangles- regardless of who they're for.

Always having wet wipes to hand and knowing the words to Let It Go are signs a woman has small children

Mothers don't get queasy at the thought of poo, wee or sick and they drive around in a people carrier because 'it seems like a good idea to own one'.

The research found that they tend to jiggle the shopping trolley as though it was a buggy and they'll instinctively grab their companion's hand when crossing the road - even if the person's an adult.

Mothers can spot a high temperature at ten paces and they know all the words to kids' TV tunes and the most irritating pop songs. 

Asda carried out the survey to celebrate their in-store baby and toddler event which ends on Sunday, 8 February. 

The supermarket's spokeswoman Lauren Venters said: 'Mums have a natural instinct to be prepared for all eventualities when they have children. 

'From stocking up on milk to always having nappies, tissues and wet wipes stored away in their handbag - mum is most definitely a wonder woman. 

'We can tell that mum rarely puts herself first, and when she finally gets round to relaxing in the evening with a nice glass of red, it ends up going straight to her head. 

'This top five signs of being a mum has taught us a lot and while many can give you a little giggle, we recognise they really go out of their way to make sure their children are happy and healthy.'
