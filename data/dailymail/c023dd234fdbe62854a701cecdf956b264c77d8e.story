A suspected gunman was arrested today thanks to members of the public who tackled him to the street after he'd run through a pub brandishing what witnesses described as an AK47.

Armed police rushed to Borough High Street, near London Bridge, just before 2pm today following reports of an attempted robbery at a Barclays bank branch.

Drinkers at The George pub, just yards from the Barclays branch, said they forced to dive for cover when the suspected armed robber burst in.

Evidence: Police forensic investigators recover a weapon in a side road off Borough High Street, near to Guy's Hospital, after the suspect in an attempted armed robbery was apprehended by members of the public

Moments later, armed police arrived and arrested the alleged gunman, described as a black man wearing a blue T-shirt, near an entrance to Guy's Hospital.

A suspect in his 30s was arrested 'after he was detained by brave members of the public,' said a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police.

Darren Burn, 26, a deputy news editor at ITV, was in The George at the time of the incident and said he saw a man run through with what looked like an AK47 assault rifle.

He tweeted: 'In The George pub in Borough and black man with a gun that looked like an AK47 run through. Men chasing him shouting 'get down he has a gun'.'

He described the moment as 'surreal' and said the gunman was carrying a Sports Direct carrier bag in his other hand.

Another called Ian Macfarlaine tweeted 'man arrested at end of road after going into my 2nd office 'the George pub' waving his gun with 3 other armed men. '

He later added: 'Apparently bloke running down the road I work on in London Bridge with an AK47.'

Another, Mike Finnerty, said: 'Man toting serious gun forces patrons at The George Pub #SE1 to dive for cover.'

Popular with both tourists and workers from the nearby hospital and offices, The George pub features extensive outdoor seating and is usually full on hot days.

A Met Police spokesman said officers had been called to the Barclays branch on Borough High Street at 1.47pm today following reports of an attempted armed robbery.

He added: 'Officers arrived at the scene and the man was arrested. He was taken to a south London police station where he currently remains.

'No shots were fired and no members of the public were injured during the incident.'

Police said a weapon had been recovered and that they were not hunting any more suspects in relation to the attempted robbery.

The incident is being investigated by detectives from the Tower Bridge Flying Squad.
