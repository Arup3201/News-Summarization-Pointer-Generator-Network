It dates back more than 1,400 years and  is the cornerstone of Welsh culture,  campaigners say.

But parents of pupils at primary schools in rural Wales claim their children are being punished by teachers who insist they use only the Welsh language.

At one school, they allege, children as young as four were told they could not go to the toilet unless they asked to do so in Welsh, while at another a young pupil was told to ‘move to England’ if she wanted to speak English in the playground.

Concerned: A website, pictured, was set up by parents worried that children will not be 'equipped' for the wider world if they do not speak English

Named: Aberaeron Primary School is one of the Ceredigion schools that have been complained about by parents

Councillor Hag Harris, Ceredigion County Council cabinet member for education, said their Welsh strategy is not 'akin' to the website's accusations

One mother was also urged to stop reading her child stories in English at bedtime and a boy of six was too frightened to speak English at home in case he got into  trouble, they say.

The parents, who have asked to remain anonymous, have set up a campaign group in Ceredigion, a Welsh-speaking stronghold, and made a formal complaint to Keith Towler, Children’s Commissioner for Wales.

Tory Welsh Assembly Member Suzy Davies said: ‘If true, these negative experiences can create a real sense of conflict for children and do nothing to promote the value of Welsh to families who may still be sceptical.’

Around a fifth of the three million people in Wales speak the native tongue.Councillor Hag Harris, of Ceredigion Council, said: ‘We’ll be happy to discuss any concerns.’

Angry: The BiLingo website, pictured, has collected a range of evidence about attitudes to English in schools. Some parents claim children are told if they are heard speaking English three times they must speak to the head teacher

 A
 dossier has been sent to the Children's Commissioner for Wales opposing
 some schools' attitude to languages. Accusations include:

Mr Towler 
has confirmed that he will no longer be investigating any of the 
allegations that children at Aberaeron Primary School in Ceredigion had 
been ‘punished’ or ‘admonished’ for speaking English.
