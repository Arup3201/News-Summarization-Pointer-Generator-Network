One hundred and thirteen dead kittens and 51 ailing adult cats have been found in an apartment belonging to a cat hoarder and in a nearby house.

None of the dead kittens appeared to be more than two months old, animal care workers in Seaside, California, said.

Police and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) for Monterey County discovered the animals on Tuesday.

Officers were alerted by a property 
manager who discovered dead kittens during an inspection. They received 
another tip that more cats were moved to a nearby house.

There, another group of investigators found 51 adult cats that were alive but sick and neglected.

Officials
have declined to identify the suspected hoarder while the investigation
is ongoing.

SPCA
Sgt Stacy Sanders said: 'The cats were living in extremely horrible 
conditions. They were separated into two groups and locked into rooms 
with little to no ventilation.

'The floors were saturated in urine and faeces.'

Officers
stayed for about six hours to recover all the cats because an occupant 
in the house had lost count of how many were there.

Sgt Sanders said: 'We had to go through every nook and cranny, pull apart every bed and chair.'

Two of the cats who survived underwent emergency surgery for potentially life-threatening uterus infections and at least five were pregnant

SPCA staff members treated the surviving cats, which were in stable condition.

SPCA spokesman Beth Brookhouser said most of those animals had respiratory infections, parasites and broken teeth.

Two underwent emergency surgery for potentially life-threatening uterus infections. At least five were pregnant.

Sgt Sanders, who has a dog and a cat, said: 'It definitely makes you go home and kind of hug your animals a little tighter at night.'

No arrests were made or citations issued, but the SPCA has referred the case to the Monterey County district attorney's office to consider criminal animal abuse charges.

Sgt Sanders said authorities received tips the cats may have taken from the street.

The officers are asking community members to send in photos of their missing cats.

Ms Brookhouser said: 'I hate to see any of these hoarding cases. They are all tragic in their own ways, but for me personally, this is the first time with so many deceased cats.'
