Hero: Steven Izegbu, 28, saw the assault from his home over the road and wrestled the attacker to the ground. Mr Izegbu had become a British citizen just hours before

A man grieving the death of his wife daubed 'I love you' in blood on a church wall as he attacked parishioners during a violent rampage, a court heard today.

Malcolm Holland, 56, armed himself with a meat cleaver and a lock knife before launching the attack at St Barnabas Church in St Paul’s Cray, near Orpington, Kent, last July.

Wearing a Halloween mask, he smashed up cars, broke into the church hall and assaulted two singers from the local music group, Croydon Crown Court heard.

He was finally stopped by a have-a-go hero who had become a British citizen only hours earlier.

Holland, who already had a history of mental illness before the death of his wife last year, said to his victims: 'My wife was taken away from me, where was your God?'

A judge today spared him a prison sentence, deciding instead to section him under the Mental Health Act.

Nicholas Dunham, prosecuting, told the court that Holland began the attack by damaging windows and assaulting the church rector’s husband.

Shouting 'My wife died of cancer and you did nothing about it', he smashed up two cars parked outside the rector’s house.

He then broke the glass in the church’s front door, causing members of local ladies’ barbershop chorus Velvet Harmony, who were practising there, to barricade themselves inside a hall.

The judge heard that Holland burst into the church hall where the women were hiding and set upon Yvonne Burr, who is in her 80s.  Mrs Burr tried to defend herself with a walking stick but Holland punched her in the face and then kicked her after knocking her to the ground.

Heroine: Gillian Page was left bruised after she bravely tried to to stop Malcolm Holland attacking Yvonne Burr, 84

When fellow group member Gillian Page, in her 60s, came to Mrs Burr’s rescue, she was also assaulted and left with bruises.

The rampage only came to an end when local man Stephen Izegbu, 28, confronted Holland.  Mr Izegbu had been made a British citizen hours earlier.

'Mr Izegbu’s home overlooks the church and, when he saw the attack on the elderly ladies, he rushed across to intervene,' Mr Dunham told the court.

'After being hit on the head with a crutch, which caused heavy bleeding, he wrestled Mr Holland to the ground and kept him there, screaming and shouting, until the police arrived.'

Officers inspecting the scene found the words “I love you” painted in blood on the wall.

Police also recovered a meat cleaver and a lock knife which Holland admitted were his but did not use in the attack.

Judge
Daniel Flahive sentenced Holland to serve a hospital order under the 
Mental Health Act in addition to a restriction order after hearing 
evidence from the doctor who is treating him.

The
court heard that Holland, who has a son, began suffering anxiety and 
depression after being taken hostage during a robbery at a petrol 
station. The sentence means he will be sectioned in hospital until those treating him consider that he is no longer a risk to the public.

The judge also praised Mr Izegbu, saying: 'The bravery he showed should be marked and if it is possible he should be paid £500 from public funds.'

Holland, of Silverdale Road, St Paul’s Cray, had already admitted one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, four counts of assault by beating, three counts of damaging property and two charges of having an article with a blade or point.

Eiran Reilly, for the defence, told the court that his client could not remember the incident and had been drinking after failing to sort out problems with his benefits when it happened.
