One group of supporters will ride in a Hummer 130 miles to London, two special ales have hit the market and a song has entered the charts alongside the likes of Coldplay. The mayor ranks the occasion higher than Noddy Holder receiving the freedom of the borough.

Walsall are at Wembley on Sunday for the first time in their 127-year history, taking on Bristol City in the Johnstone’s Paint Trophy final, and fans are already celebrating.

‘I’ll be a 55-year-old kid,’ says Supporters Trust secretary Steve Davies. ‘To actually make it to the home of English football is something special.’

At 3.30pm, Walsall will happily exit a group of Football League teams never to have played at Wembley, leaving behind Accrington Stanley, Crawley Town and Hartlepool United.

They have come close four times. They lost to Bournemouth and Millwall in area finals of the same competition in 1998 and 1999. In 1984 they succumbed 4-2 over two legs to a Liverpool side featuring Ian Rush and Alan Hansen in their Milk Cup semi-final, and they were beaten by Crewe in the 1993 Third Division play-off semi.

They did reach the 2001 Division Two play-off final against Alan Pardew’s Reading — but with Wembley under reconstruction, their 3-2 victory took place at the Millennium Stadium.

That day in Cardiff, 15,000 fans showed up. Nearly 30,000 are making the trip to England’s capital, around seven times Walsall’s average home gate.

‘It’s unprecedented,’ says Walsall chief executive Stefan Gamble. ‘We’ve never had to deal with demand on this level. It has given the club, town, and supporters a real lift and captured the imagination.

‘For a club of our size it makes a significant impact on the manager’s playing budget for next season. This one match will generate more revenue than all our home games put together. It’s huge.’

More than 70,000 tickets have been sold, making the match the biggest in England this weekend and likely bettered only by El Clasico for attendance in Europe.

Dean Smith, the fourth longest-serving league manager behind Arsenal’s Arsene Wenger, Exeter’s Paul Tisdale and Karl Robinson at MK Dons, has succeeded where many others have failed.

‘It’s an amazing achievement, especially when I think of the calibre of some of the managers who have been here before me,’ Smith says. ‘I feel very proud.’

The run began last October at Rochdale. Davies was among the 102 ‘hardy souls’ in attendance when Mathieu Manset scored the winner, his only goal for Walsall. He has since joined Cheltenham.

There was then a slender victory over Sheffield United, cup conquerors of four Premier League teams in two seasons, and a penalty shootout win over Tranmere in the area semi-final.

Preston were favourites in the area final but Walsall won the first leg at Deepdale 2-0 through late goals from Anthony Forde and Tom Bradshaw, aged 21 and 22.

‘The second leg was fraught,’ says Davies. ‘We tend to be a little fatalistic as Walsall fans. Even at 2-0 we wouldn’t actually believe it was happening until the fat lady sang. We’d been to the area final twice before and cocked it up.’ The match at the Banks’s Stadium ended goalless in front of 10,038 fans — but chairman Jeff Bonser was not among them, having been in self-imposed exile from home matches for close to five years.

Bonser, who took control of Walsall in 1992, stopped going in the face of fierce criticism from fans over his running of the club, having decided his presence would undermine performances. He will be at Wembley, though.

‘He comes into the club every day during the week and still fully supports the club both financially and morally,’ says Gamble. ‘He is as keen as anyone to see us win.’

Former players will be in the stands, too. Watford striker Troy Deeney, who scored 27 goals in 136 games for Walsall, visited his old manor on Wednesday to buy his ticket and Mark Rees, who played in that League Cup tie against Liverpool 31 years ago, will be there.

Davies, meanwhile, has booked a Hummer for the drive down. ‘We’re doing it properly,’ he laughs.

Many fans will have supped either (or both) of the ales produced in recognition. The Backyard Brewhouse, the only brewery in Walsall, has been pumping Super Saddlers beer to local pubs in recent weeks and the Supporters’ Trust have a limited number of bottles of their own offering, which features a picture of Forde’s goal from the Preston game on the label.

Walsall FC Go To Wembley, a song by local band The Assist, is riding high in the iTunes ‘alternative’ music chart, sparring with tracks by Coldplay and the Arctic Monkeys. ‘It’s not a singalong, they’re an indie band. The lads are chuffed,’ says Davies.

The town has been painted red. Literally. A famous concrete hippo in the centre has received a splash of club colours.

‘There have been some memorable events recently but this will be the highlight whether we win or lose,’ says councillor Pete Smith, the mayor.

‘The second is when we gave Noddy Holder, a Walsall lad, freedom of the borough.’

Come on feel the noise.
