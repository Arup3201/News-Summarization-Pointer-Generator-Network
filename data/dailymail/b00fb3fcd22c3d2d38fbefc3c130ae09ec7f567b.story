Britain's first youth police commissioner described herself as ‘naive and stupid’ yesterday for posting homophobic and racist comments on the internet.

A tearful Paris Brown, 17, also apologised for leaving messages on Twitter boasting about her sex life, drinking binges and drugs.

Far from being a teenage ladette, she claimed she had never actually taken drugs or been drunk – although she enjoyed drinking Malibu and lemonade while ‘at home with my Mum watching TV’.

Remorse: A tearful Paris Brown yesterday after apologising for the remarks she made on Twitter

Some MPs said Miss Brown’s Twitter comments were shocking and called for her to be sacked from the £15,000-a-year taxpayer-funded role, which she has held for less than a week.

Others expressed sympathy for her and questioned the wisdom of appointing the 17-year-old to hold public office in the first place.

Miss Brown was given the job of helping Kent police ‘stay in touch with young people’ amid huge fanfare last week.

Appearing before photographers 
yesterday, however, she burst into tears after saying her online 
comments – made between the ages of 14 and 16 – had simply been ‘showing
 off’.

In the messages she called homosexuals
 ‘fags’, immigrants ‘illegals’ and travellers ‘pikeys’, and said she had
 ‘a thing for older men’, an apparent reference to a teacher at her 
former school.

In another tweet, seemingly referring to cannabis, she wrote: ‘I really wanna make a batch of hash brownies.’

Paris Brown has apologised for the remarks made on Twitter 

Another
 tweet read: ‘Worst part about being single is coming home from a 
party/night out horny as **** and having to sleep alone.’

She also 
boasted several times of being ‘painfully, unattractively drunk’, and 
once wrote: ‘Been drinking since half 1 and riding baby walkers down the
 hall at work oh my god i have the best job ever haha!!’ – although 
yesterday she said that tweet referred to her drinking water.

Only 
two months ago, Miss Brown wrote: ‘******* hell why are the people from 
Direct Pizza so difficult to talk too!! IT IS CALLED ENGLISH. LEARN IT.’

And
 she attacked the men in the reality TV programme Made In Chelsea, 
writing: ‘Everyone on Made In Chelsea looks like a ******* fag.’

Miss
 Brown, who lives with her parents in a £250,000 three-bedroom terrace 
house in Sheerness, on the Isle of Sheppey, was chosen out of 164 
applicants for the youth post within Kent’s Police and Crime 
Commissioner’s Office last week.

She impressed Ann Barnes, who was 
elected to the £85,000-a-year PCC role last year, during an interview in
 which she said she wanted the job to ‘make a difference’.

The 
teenager, who is now carrying out an apprenticeship as an office junior 
with Swale Borough Council, admitted yesterday to drinking underage at 
both home and parties, but denied taking drugs.

She said: ‘They were 
just stupid, stupid tweets, and I’m so sorry they’ve caused offence. I 
was just being a stupid, naive teenager.

‘They’ve been taken out of context and they were not meant to offend. I am not a nasty person, I am not racist or homophobic.

‘I
 have, like any teenager, been to house parties and of course I’ve had a
 drink but I’ve never been drunk. I’m capable of enjoying myself without
 alcohol.

‘If I’m at home with my Mum watching TV I might have a 
Malibu and lemonade but that’s part of being a teenager, experiencing 
things.

'However, I have never taken drugs and I do not condone the 
taking of drugs because that’s nothing to be proud of.

'Regarding the 
tweet about me drinking since half past one, I didn’t mean alcohol, I 
meant water.

Role: Miss Brown was hired to cover Kent and was interviewed by the county's assistant chief constable

'I was on a water diet which means you drink two-and-a-half 
to four litres a day.

’She said the line about ‘hash brownies’ was ‘a reference to a Scooby Doo film’.

Miss
 Brown added that her father Dennis, a 51-year-old charity fundraiser, 
and mother Debra, 48, a GP’s receptionist, were disappointed after 
reading the messages.

Mrs Barnes, 67, defended Miss Brown’s 
appointment, adding: ‘You’ve got to give her credit – not many people in
 public life who do something stupid and wrong would put themselves up 
in front of the national media and say, “Look, I’m ashamed of myself” 
and explain herself.

'I’m very proud of Paris doing this.

‘If I had any sniff of her being racist or homophobic she wouldn’t be sitting here now.

‘People
 make mistakes.

'These tweets were made when she was 14 or 15 and I don’t
 think it’s fair for her to pay for this for the rest of her life.’

But 
others called for her to be sacked.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons 
home affairs select committee, said: ‘This individual should be removed 
from their post immediately.

‘Public money should never be given to 
anyone who refers to sex, violence, drunkenness and other anti-social 
behaviour in this offensive manner.’

Tunbridge Wells Conservative 
councillor Nicholas Rogers said it had been ‘naive to throw a teen into a
 robust political environment’.

Writing on his Twitter account, he added: ‘Youth PCC nice bit of PR, but ended in tears.’
