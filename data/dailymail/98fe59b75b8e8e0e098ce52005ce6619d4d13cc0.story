Hero: Officer Nelson Hearns helped a pregnant woman deliver her baby and had the honor of having the child named after him

Welcome to the world: Kace Nelson Kraft was born at 9:11 a.m on Sunday morming, weighing in at 4 pounds 1 ounce, in his parents living room!

Ready to pop:  31-year-old Jody Copier was in labor by the time officer Nelson Hearns arrived on the scene

Quick delivery: The officer positioned and reassured Copier, and even grabbed a pillow and several towels to make sure she was comfortable. Within seconds, the baby was delivered

'I was so early, I didn't think I was going to deliver a baby,' she told NBC News at the hospital.

Officer Hearns, who has more than 11 years experience, saw that the baby's feet were coming first in a breech birth and the officer jumped right into action.

He positioned and reassured Jody even grabbing a pillow and towels to make sure she was comfortable.

Working with the baby's father, Scott Kraft, the newborn was delivered within seconds.

Help at hand: Emergency medical technicians arrived within moments of the birth and transported the family to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston

Jody Copier: I don't know what we would have done if Officer Hearns didn't get there so quick

Husband Scott Kraft and wife Jody: Kraft says he can't thank the officer enough

'He sat right on the floor, and we started crying,' said Jody's husband, Scott Kraft. 'He had his eyes open, he was blinking.'

'I would never have expected to bring my little boy into my living room,' he said. 'For being here so early, and breeched birth, I just can't believe how strong and perfect this kid is.'

Officer Hearns said he relied on his experience to recognize that the baby was in position for a breech birth, a rare and potentially dangerous delivery.

'Within 45 seconds he pulled the baby out,' Scott said. 'While I pushed, he pulled. It was nuts,' he told NJ.com.

An ambulance arrived soon afterwards and took the family to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston. He weighed 4 pounds 1 ounce.

The boy, weighing 4 pounds 1 ounce, was named Kase Nelson Kraft, the middle name in honor of the officer who delivered him

Officer Hearns was excited to assist with the birth and happy that Kace will share his name

The family originally planned to give Kace the middle name William but decided the circumstances called for something special — the baby’s middle name is Nelson, in honor of the police officer who helped bring him into the world.

'He deserves it, without a doubt,' said Scott.

Jody added, 'I don't know what we would have done if [Hearns] didn't get there so quick.'

Cranford Police Chief James Wozniak had plenty of well wishes for the family and praise for his officer.

'This is a great job all around, and I’m thrilled that the result is a happy, healthy baby boy. This is the kind of thing my officers train for,' he noted.

'It is still rewarding to see the actions of a Cranford police officer having a positive impact on someone’s life. I’m incredibly proud of Officer Hearns and everyone else who was present.'

The baby and mother are doing well, Kraft said. She is due home later today, and little Kace is out of an incubator and off intravenous fluids.

Though doctors originally said Kace could be in the hospital for months, they now plan to send the baby home in 10 days.

Husband Scott says he can't thank the officer enough.

'He brought my new best friend into this world, and he is gonna be with me forever,' he said.

'It’s an honor and a blessing to be part of something special in their lives,' Officer Hearns said.
