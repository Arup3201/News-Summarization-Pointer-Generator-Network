More than £1.8m is to be paid back to motorists after they were fined for driving over a city centre bridge.

Almost 60,000 motorists were issued with penalty notices for using the Lendal Bridge in York after controversial traffic restrictions were introduced.

But the scheme was abandoned after an independent review found the council may have acted unlawfully, and York City Council has confirmed a process for the public to claim the money back is now being worked on. 

Council leaders in York restricted access to the busy bridge in during an ill-fated traffic experiment 

Council officials wrongly designated the bridge a bus lane when the trial was launched in August 2013

Before the scheme was launched, the bridge, pictured, was heavily congested throughout the day

Cllr David Levene, cabinet member for transport, said the trial 'was never about making money' and that work had to be done to resolve traffic issues in York.

He said: 'But whilst the trial achieved some of its aims, it had become too polarizing an issue, requiring too much resource, and so detracting from other necessary transport policies.

'An application will have to be made for refunds to be given as "a statement of goodwill" and will not be volunteered as that would legally say the scheme was wrong.'

But following the decision, the leader of York City Council, Councillor James Alexander, has faced calls from the Liberal Democrats to stand down. 

Cllr Keith Aspden, leader of York's Liberal Democrats, said: 'The closure of Lendal Bridge was botched from start to finish and has done deep reputational damage to York.

'As well as repaying the fines, Labour should apologise to the residents, visitors and businesses caught out by the unlawful closure.'

He continued: 'They need to explain how the repayment process will work and what effect this decision will have on council budgets. They also need to accept our calls for a full scrutiny review of the trial so that all lessons are learnt.

'What is clear though is that ultimate responsibility for the shambles sits with the Council Leader James Alexander and I, along with many taxpayers, will now expect him to recognise this and resign.'

Council officials expect they will have to repay £1.8 million in fines levied during the botched experiment

Meanwhile, conservative Cllr Paul Doughty, said: 'Now finally, not before time, they are forced to repay the fines yet still manage to dig the knife in as the ultimate penalty is paid by the York taxpayer who has to pick up the bill. 

'Not only for the hundreds of thousands to repay fines but also the massive cost it will take to administer, the effect on services this may have as well as the city's reputation which they leave in tatters.

'Cllr Alexander even has the gall to say, "all parties told me they want to move on". Indeed but he cannot be so naive to believe others will share his administrations blame. In any other industry, heads would roll.'

He suggested senior figures at the council should resign.

Conservative leader Cllr Chris Steward said 'heads should roll' over the matter and said officers should be answerable. 

He said the matter was of great reputational and financial cost to York.On the basis of independent legal advice, the City of York Council had been contesting the Traffic Adjudicator's challenge to both the Lendal Bridge and Coppergate schemes. 

It will now only continue to contest the Coppergate order.Cllr James Alexander said: 'When Liberal Democrats back the cause of Conservatives, that speaks volumes.

'Councillors from all parties have told me that they want to move on, and they are right. It is for this reason, to draw the matter to a close and as a gesture of goodwill, that we make this announcement today.

'The council does not accept the finding of the Traffic Penalty Tribunal as regards the lawful ability to regulate traffic in this way, and is therefore continuing to pursue a review of the Tribunal's decision in relation to the permanent Coppergate order.

'However, the Lendal Bridge trial has now finished, and for this reason, the council does not consider it to be in the public interest to pursue the review in respect of Lendal Bridge.

'The council has taken the decision that in respect of those people who received a fine during the trial traffic regulation of Lendal Bridge, a refund will be made if they make a particular request to the council. This is due to the clear level of public concern during the trial. 

'It is hoped that this can be seen as a statement of goodwill and we are drawing a line under the matter.'

The bridge was used by many tourists who were unaware of the restrictions and hit with a £30 fine
