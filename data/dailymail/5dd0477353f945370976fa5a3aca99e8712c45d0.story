Many families are opting for two Christmas trees this year as the economy improves.

They are also choosing taller trees to make their homes look extra special this festive season, according to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association (BCTGA).

Traditionally, 6ft trees have been popular, but demand is growing for 7ft and 8ft trees.

Christmas tree grower Vincent Thurkettle says there is a good crop this year because of the mild weather and prices are about the same as last year, with 6ft Nordmann Firs at about £44 and 6ft Norway Spruces at £28.

Harry Brightwell, secretary of the BCTGA, said: ‘Lots of people now like to have two trees, one in the lounge and another in the dining room or hall, because it adds to the festive atmosphere.

‘The tree is the centrepiece of Christmas for many and 6ft trees have always been popular, but now we are finding people are opting for that extra foot.’

Mr Thurkettle, 58, who grows Norway Spruce, Blue Spruce and Nordmann Firs at Manor Farm in Great Hockham, Norfolk, said: ‘People want trees which go from floor to ceiling. I think the economy is picking up and there is more money about.

‘We are also finding people are keen to buy narrow, space-saving trees. They want it to be a feature in the room but they don’t want it to dominate.’
