The glamorous Ukrainian assistant who stole nearly $1million from Nicky Hilton's ex-husband was ordered by a judge today to repay the money in two weeks' time or go to jail for up to three years.

Renata Shamrakova appeared at Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday where she was told to repay half of the $821,000 she stole by December 19. The 28-year-old looked strained as she stalked into court with her dark hair expertly coiffed, wearing a clinging, grey wool dress and knee-high leather boots.

Shamrakova embezzled the money from financier Todd Meister while working as his personal assistant in 2011.

Shamrakova faces one to three years in jail if she fails to come up with the money on the deadline. She recently claimed that she is still broke. 

Her parents are frantically trying to 
sell their upstate New York home so their daughter can avoid jail after her attempts to raise money through a social media campaign 
was met with vitriol, abuse and a sum total of $335.

The remaining money is owed by March 2015.

In March, the former PA confessed to taking out 
two American Express cards in Meister's name and spending $900,000 
traveling to Aruba, Canada, France and Italy.

The Ukranian-born swindler spent the 
money while working as his assistant between March 2011 and January 2012
- and while no court records have identified her employer - it is a 
well-known fact that it was Meister.

Shamrakova tried to raise the $821,000 with an online campaign... but made less that $400

When she appeared at Manhattan Supreme Court last month to update a judge
on her progress with the restitution, the 28-year-old revealed that she 
was engaged to mystery man she described only as 'Jewish' and 'with 
dreamy blue eyes'.

'I’m passionately in love,' she told the New York Post. 'I’ve met my match and couldn’t be happier.'

She appeared still to be sporting the diamond engagement ring when pictured today but made a point of keeping her hands deep in her pockets.

The court estimated the ring to be at least two carats but Shamrakova previously said that she would never sell it because it wouldn't dent the total debt she owes.

'Everyone is going to say I should sell it,' she said in November. 'But it wouldn’t come close (to satisfying the debt).'

Explaining that her fiancé is in fashion she took a dig at Meister.

'He’s not in finance. I wouldn’t make 
that mistake twice. He is a family man and very devoted. He stuck by me 
through this and I’m so grateful.'

Shamrakova used credit cards she took out in Meister's name to buy jewellery and fly off on exotic vacations

Todd Meister was briefly married to Nikki Hilton, the younger sister of Paris Hilton, in 2004

If she avoids jail she claims she will wed in East Hampton.

In addition to the credit card fraud,
Shamrakova also bought thousands of pieces of jewelery which she then 
sold online for cash and paid off the credit cards by writing checks 
from her lover's JPMorgan account without his knowledge.

She
also tried to spend some of the stolen money on starting up a jewelery 
curating business called Karat & Ice which she called a 'trusted 
carrier of authentic quality designer merchandise'.

In
court, she tried to argue that she was in a relationship with Mr 
Meister, but he denied that, saying: ‘The women I date are far more 
highly educated.’

Meister married hotel heiress Nicky Hilton - the younger sister of Paris Hilton - when she was 20 and he was 33 years old in Las Vegas after dating for three months. The marriage was annulled after 85 days.
