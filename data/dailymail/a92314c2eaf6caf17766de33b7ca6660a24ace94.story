A family that emigrated from Mexico more than two decades ago in search of a better life has been ripped apart after the blast that collapsed two buildings in Harlem on Wednesday claimed the lives of two of its members.

Cecilio Hernandez keeps a vigil at the Harlem Hospital Center bedside of his 15-year-old son Oscar, who is in a critical condition after the explosion.

Hernandez's wife Rosaura Barrios-Vasquez, 44, and daughter Rosaura Hernandez, 21, were among the eight people killed on Wednesday.

Hernandez had already left for his job in a restaurant kitchen and his youngest child, a four-year-old girl, was at school on Wednesday morning when the two buildings were leveled without warning. Hernandez and his wife left Mexico and built a new life for themselves more than 20 years ago.The family lived in a fourth floor apartment 1644 Park Avenue and Hernandez  worked hard as a restaurant cook to send his three children to school.

'He is devastated as you can imagine. He is, like most Mexicans living in that area, a cook who works very hard to take care of his family,' Mexico's Consul-General Sandra Fuentes Berain told the Wall Street Journal.Hernandez's daughter Rosaura was an aspiring chef and was achieving everything her parents had hoped for her when they left Mexico all those years ago.

Proud: Rosaura was following her dream of becoming a chef and worked as a line cook like her father

She had recently completed culinary training and had so impressed during an internship that she was offered a job working as a line cook at the posh Triomphe restaurant at the Iroquois Hotel in Midtown Manhattan.

'He told me the daughter could finally help them pay the bills. She had just graduated from a chef school. He was so proud of her,' said Berain.

Hotel general manager Robert Holmes called Hernandez's death ‘truly a terrible loss.’

Holmes
 said the 22-year-old was at the restaurant just under two years. He 
said she started as an intern and became a line cook when a position 
opened up.

He said she was ‘calm, cool and collected’ in the demanding restaurant environment.

Rosaura Hernandez's body was found on Wednesday. Her mother's remains were pulled from the rubble Thursday.

According to the family's pastor at the Spanish Christian Church, Rosaura Barrios-Vasquez was dedicated to her children and on the morning she died had been preparing to take Oscar to a doctor's appointment for a serious skin condition the teen suffers from.

'I don’t know how it is that Oscar survived and she got pinned by the rubble. Thank God at least he survived,' Rivera told the New York Daily News.

On the day of the blast, residents of the adjacent buildings were going about their mornings: cleaning their teeth, eating breakfast, getting ready to head out the door.

Oscar had apparently been sleeping when the buildings exploded.

Rescue workers came upon a boy lying on a mattress amid the rubble, silent but alive.

'He was conscious,' Officer Paul Pastorini told the New York Times. 'He was covered in blood. His eyes were moving around.'

They lifted the boy, still wrapped in his blanket, and as they carried him down to the street, flames shooting from the buildings became so intense that rescuers had to retreat.

Pastorini doesn't like to think about what would have become of Oscar if they hadn't noticed him when they did.

At Harlem Hospital Center, Oscar is 
recovering from instense burns, internal injuries and fractures. He is 
in a critical but stable condition.

Cecilio Hernandez has not spoken publicly about the tragedy.

'They
 were always happy and hardworking, very humble,' Zoraida Rivera, 59, a 
friend of the family, told the New York Daily News.

'Now Cecilio is left alone with his two children. This is so difficult.'

Hernandez
 is receiving help from the Mexican Consulate. He plans to send the 
bodies of his wife and daughter back to Mexico for burial.
