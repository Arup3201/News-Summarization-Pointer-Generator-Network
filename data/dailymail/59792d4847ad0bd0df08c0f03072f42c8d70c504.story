Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has no interest in using English players next season unless they contribute to another Premier League title tilt.

The Chilean failed to start a single Englishman as his side were convincingly beaten 3-0 by Arsenal in the Community Shield on Sunday.

Micah Richards, James Milner and Scott Sinclair all came off the bench to play a part at Wembley, but Pellegrini insists that he will only utilise the homegrown players in his squad if they are best equipped to help his side win.

Pellegrini told the Manchester Evening News: ‘I repeat this was a special game but during the year I don’t look at the nationality of the players.

'I use the players I think are the best players to win that game. It doesn’t matter where they come from.'

Recent signing Willy Caballero was preferred in goal to regular No 1 Joe Hart, while Englishmen Jack Rodwell, Gareth Barry and Joleon Lescott have all been allowed to leave the club this summer.

Although Frank Lampard has been signed on a short-term contract until January, Pellegrini's five other summer signings have been foreign.

The former Malaga boss added: 'Every week I will pick the team I think will win the game.'

City begin the defence of their Premier League title away at Newcastle on August 17 before hosting Liverpool at the Etihad eight days later.
