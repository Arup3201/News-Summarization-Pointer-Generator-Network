Proud: St Mary's headteacher Kim Hall, whose school is one of the best-performing in the country

The devastating extent to which primary schools are failing bright pupils was revealed yesterday.

Up to 51,000 11-year-olds who achieved top grades at age seven have effectively gone backwards after being left to coast in maths and English.

Four in ten youngsters who were above average in the three Rs at seven are failing to fulfil their early promise, official league tables show.

Around half of primary schools – more than 7,500 – have failed to get each of their brightest pupils up to the highest grades in Key Stage Two tests at 11.

Among these schools, more than 800 could not get all their young high achievers even up to the national average.

This left around 1,300 pupils at a disadvantage when they started secondary school in September. Despite their flying start, they were still struggling to grasp the point of a story, write sentences using commas or add, subtract, multiply and divide in their heads.

The Department for Education has identified a hard core of 15 schools where more than 20 per cent of pupils who were high attainers at seven sank to the ranks of the lowest achievers at 11.

Schools Minister Nick Gibb said the Government was ‘shining a light’ on these schools.

Critics claim the figures are a damning indictment of a league table culture which has encouraged schools to concentrate on youngsters of low to middle ability at the expense of the brightest.

Schools are judged on how  well they do in getting pupils to level four, the expected standard, in the basics and many teachers focus their efforts on borderline pupils to improve their league table positions.

The Department for Education 
yesterday published school-by-school data for around 15,000 state 
primaries in England, based on national curriculum test results in 
English and maths.

The tables reveal for the first time 
how low, middle and high achieving pupils at seven go on to perform in 
the Key Stage Two tests four years later. The statistics show that more 
than 2,000 primary schools are serving their middle achievers better 
than their brightest pupils in English lessons. 

There is at least a 20 percentage 
point gap in the levels of progress made by middle versus high achievers
in the subject in 2,160 schools.

 

This emphasis has also contributed to
11 per cent of children – around 32,000 – who were ‘middle’ achievers 
at seven rising to join  the ranks of the highest achievers at the age 
of 11.

The figures show that 74 per cent of 
pupils achieved level four in both English and maths this year, up one 
percentage point in 12 months.

The proportion of bright boys and girls 
exceeding the standard expected – level five – fell by four percentage 
points to 29 per cent in English and increased by one percentage point 
in maths to 35 per cent.

Professor Alan Smithers of Buckingham
University said children in the top ability range are ‘perhaps too 
often left to their own devices’.

He said: ‘The way schools are judged 
has a massive effect on their behaviour. If they are asked to account 
for how many children are getting to level four, that’s where their 
effort is going to go.

‘We don’t do enough for the really able in our education system.’

Nearly one in ten state primary 
schools face possible closure or takeover after failing to hit Coalition
targets in the three Rs.

Nationally, 1,310 are falling short of Government benchmarks in English and maths.

Ministers have already identified the
200 worst primaries which will be pulled out of local authority control
and turned into academies under new leadership teams as early as next 
September.

Hundreds more will now be ordered to improve or face similar intervention.

 The head of one of the country’s best primary schools has attacked the Coalition’s education reforms.

Paul Fisher, of Oakridge Primary 
School in Stafford, claimed yesterday that the changes would focus on 
facts instead of skills, and said: ‘Do we want a society that’s great at
pub quizzes or one that’s great at thinking and problem solving?’

Nearly all the 34 children at his 
school taking English and maths tests exceeded the standard expected of 
their age to gain the higher level five.
