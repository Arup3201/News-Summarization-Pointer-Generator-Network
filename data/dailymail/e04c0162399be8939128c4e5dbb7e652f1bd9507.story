Sales of handsets such as BlackBerry touch slow to 11 million per quarter: Analysts say that the company RIM 'needs to get new handsets out' - but CEO Mike Lazaridis admitted that the new 'BB10' handsets now face delays until late 2012

New, touchscreen BlackBerries designed to update the smartphone brand for consumers used to iPhones and other touch handsets such as Android have been delayed until the end of next year.

It's a delay that some analysts predict could be disastrous for the company.

The touchscreen BB10 phones were crucial to updating the brand.

The co-CEOs insisted that BlackBerry can hold out - but admitted that BlackBerry sales were falling month by month, and that net income had fallen 71 per cent.

Earlier this year, BlackBerry also ran into trademark difficulties for the new operating system - BBX - and renamed the phones BB10 to avoid a dispute.

No official name or spec for any of the handsets has yet been revealed.

Shots of an angular handset supposedly known as BlackBerry London leaked earlier this month.

The phones will run an operating system that's mid-way between the simple, old-style operating system of current BlackBerries, and the more iPad-esque OS of the recent BlackBerry PlayBook.

PlayBook was another disaster for the company, with the seven-inch tablet sold at a damaging loss after customers failed to take an interest.

PlayBook required a BlackBerry phone 'tethered' to it for email to work - unlike any other tablet on the market.

Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies 
& Co in New York, said the 
company needs to get its new phones out fast.

Mike Lazaridis, one of the company's co-CEOs, said the BlackBerry 10 phones will need a new chipset that will not be available until mid-2012, so the company expects the new phones to ship late in the year.'We've experienced a delay,' he said.

Analysts say RIM's future depends on the new software.

RIM said BlackBerry sales will fall sharply in the holiday quarter, providing further evidence that it is struggling to compete with the iPhone and smartphones running Android.

It has also been having a hard time finding a niche in the tablet computer market, which is dominated by Apple's iPad.

RIM said its net income sank 71% as revenue fell and the company took a large accounting charge because it had to sell its PlayBook tablet computer at a deep discount.

The Canadian company said revenue fell 6% to 5.2 billion dollars.The company shipped 14.1 million BlackBerry smartphones during the third quarter and 150,000 PlayBook tablet. RIM said it would only ship between 11 million and 12 million BlackBerrys in the fourth quarter and said earnings would be in the range of 80 to 95 cents per share.

Otherwise, RIM could lose money in future quarters as it continues to struggle to sell the current, stopgap models.

Jim Balsillie, the other co-CEO, acknowledged the challenges facing the once-iconic company and said executives are working to turn it around.

'It may take some time to realise the benefits of these efforts and the platform transition that we are undertaking, but we continue to believe that RIM has the right set of strengths and capabilities to maintain a leading role in the mobile communications industry,' he said.

RIM's stock fell 1.20 dollars to 13.93 dollars in extended trading after the results were released.
