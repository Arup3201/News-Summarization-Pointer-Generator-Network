A four-year-old girl has become an internet sensation after a film of her trying to sing a nursery rhyme has got more than half a million hits.

Adorable Lola Webb from Dartford, Kent, tries to sing the call-and-response nursery rhyme One Day We Went To The Zoo with her father, Dean.

He sits behind the camera as he sings the words of the title to her and patiently tries to get her to repeat the words 'to the zoo' back.

But little Lola can't quite get it right and repeatedly gives a number of wrong responses.

Towards the end of the 95 second clip she pauses and concentrates and appears to be about to give the right reply - before getting it wrong for a final time. 

The film has now racked up more than 541,000 hits on YouTube.

Dean, 32, who runs his own barbers, said: 'I took her downstairs and was trying to cheer her up and I started to clap and sing the song. 

'I said to her 'you just have to sing to the zoo' and she gave me such a funny blank expression. I grabbed the iPad because it was so funny.

'I put it on Facebook and friends and family shared it. She's just such a funny little girl and she never gives up if she can't get something.'

Lola, who was dressed in Disney pyjamas and singing for her nine-month-old brother Rocco said: 'I love singing and I love dancing and being famous.' 

Lola loves to sing and dance and goes to stage school 'she's just so excited by the whole thing'

Lola's mum Jade, 30, said: 'We just can't believe that it's gone viral. When it went up online it gained more than 100,000 in a day.

'Lola loves to sing and dance and goes to stage school, and she's just so excited by the whole thing.

'She's always been confident. She generally sings her own made up songs, she's not one to be told how to do it.'
