A vicar claims he will have to leave the country after his Eastern European wife was denied a visa on 'language grounds' - even though she’s an English teacher.

Reverend Elwyn Phillips, 55, is quitting the UK and moving to Ukraine to be with his wife Lesya, 36.

The couple married earlier this year and were making plans to live in his parish at Cwmbran, South Wales.

Visa row: Vicar Elwyn Phillips, 55 says he is being forced to leave the country after his Eastern European wife Lesya was denied a visa on 'language grounds' - despite being an English teacher

But immigration bosses barred her from entering Britain saying she was not able to meet the minimum English language requirements.

University educated Lesya is a qualified teacher and gives English lessons in her home city of Kiev.

Now Rev Phillips is going to move to 1,300 miles and set up home in the Eastern European country.

The clergyman said: 'Lesya’s English is flawless - she obviously has an accent but everyone understands her.

'I just couldn’t believe it when they said she cannot live here on language grounds, it’s ridiculous.

'People from the European Union can come here without being able to speak a word of English.

'Yet you have someone who can speak the language rejected - it just seems so unjust.'

Wedding day: Elwyn and Lesya on their wedding day had planned to live in his parish at Cwmbran, South Wales

Rejection: The Home Office rejected Lesya's application to live with her husband Elwyn Phillips on the grounds that her language skills were not adequate

Counting the cost: Vicar Elwyn Phillips, pictured with wife Lesya, is now planning to move 1,300 miles to Kiev to be with her because the couple cannot afford to reapply for her visa

Rev
Phillips, of the Cwmbran Christian Centre, near Newport, South Wales, 
married Lesya in Kiev in March and applied for a spouse visa for the new
Mrs Phillips.

To secure a visa to live with a UK citizen in Britain, applicants must satisfy strict criteria.

Both must be aged 18 or over at the date of application.

Your partner is not related to you in a way that means you could not marry in UK law.

You and your partner have met in person.

Your relationship with your partner is genuine and subsisting.

If you are married or in a civil partnership, your marriage or civil partnership is valid in UK law, that any previous relationship has permanently broken down (this does not apply to certain polygamous relationships).

You and your partner intend to live together permanently in the UK.

You meet the financial requirement.

You meet the English language requirement and if you are in the UK and want to extend your leave or apply for settlement in the UK you will need to meet the suitability requirement.

But the Home Office rejected the application even though Lesya holds a teaching qualification from the National University of Kiev.

Immigrant chiefs say they do not consider her degree a 'recognised language qualification,' and that she’s not welcome in the UK.

Rev Phillips, whose first wife died of cancer last year, has daughters and an elderly father still living in his home town of Cwmbran.

But he says he has no choice but to leave his family and move to Ukraine to be with his wife.

The dad-of-two said: 'I’ve secured a Ukrainian visa and put my house up for sale.

'My children are devastated but they understand I can’t be without her.

'Would the Home Office want this for their own family? It just seems completely unfair and inhumane.'

Rev Phillips says he has already spent £1,500 on the last visa application and is unable to afford another.

A Home Office spokesman said: 'Every visa application is considered in line with the UK’s immigration rules.

'It is the responsibility of the applicant to ensure they provide the required evidence to support their application.

'Mrs Phillips has the right to make a new application for a visa but must provide the correct information to support it.'
