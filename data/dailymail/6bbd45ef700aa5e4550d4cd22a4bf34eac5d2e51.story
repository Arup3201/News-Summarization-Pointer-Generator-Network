Today's service at Westminster Abbey celebrated the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation.

The
 monarch was crowned at the Abbey on June 2, 1953 and within its ancient
 walls she will mark the milestone with the nation and her family.

Among the first to arrive was Labour leader Ed Miliband who walked through the Abbey's great west door.

The weather on the day of the 
coronation 60 years ago was dull and rainy but it did not put off the 
estimated three million people who lined the route of the procession.

Spectators
 and guests were bathed in brilliant summer sunshine as they arrived for
 the formal service or lined the streets near the Abbey.

Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall chose a very pale blue coat and straw hat for the service while the Queen's asymmetric hat was finished with a cluster of delicate blue roses

The
 service was been divided into the Recognition, Anointing, Homage and 
Thanksgiving, reflecting parts of the original Coronation ceremony.

The majestic St Edward's Crown - with which the Queen was crowned - was rested on the High Altar - the first time the heavy, solid gold, jewel encrusted crown has left the Tower of London since the 1953 coronation.

The Ampulla, the gold, eagle shaped bottle from which the holy oil was poured for the anointing - the most sacred part of the coronation - also stood on the altar.

A flask of aromatic oil - taken from the same batch made for the Queen's coronation - was processed through the Abbey, carried by representatives of the people of the UK , to the Sacrarium, received by the Archbishop of Canterbury and placed by the Dean of Westminster on the High Altar.

Prime Minister David Cameron, who arrived without wife Samantha Cameron, gave a reading, as did the Secretary General of the Commonwealth Kamalesh Sharma.

Actress Claire Skinner, who stars in the BBC sitcom Outnumbered, also read a poem written for the anniversary by the Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.
