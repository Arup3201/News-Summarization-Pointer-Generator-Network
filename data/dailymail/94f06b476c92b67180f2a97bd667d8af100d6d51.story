A spokesman for Thames Valley Police 
said: 'We were called at 6.30am by a member of the public who reported 
they had come across a collision involving a blue Honda CBR motorcycle.

'The investigation remains at an 
early stage. However it appears a large rock had been placed in the 
carriageway, which the motorcycle struck.

His grieving family revealed how riding motorbikes was Mr Edwards' passion and he had been a rider for many years.

A family tribute said: 'He would do anything for anyone without question and should have been celebrating his birthday on October 12.

'Words cannot express how much he will be missed.

'He was married to Kim for 30 years. 
His passion was motorbikes and he had been riding them from a very early
age and was an extremely experienced and competent rider.

'He was a member of the Goldwing Owners Club GB and Thames Valley Wings.'

It added: 'He started his career in the building trade before changing direction to work in retail.

'He was on his way home from work at around 6.30am when he was needlessly killed by a person, or persons, who had moved a concrete block from the verge and put it in the centre of the carriageway.'

Relatives said they were devastated and urged anyone with information about the incident in Daws Hill Lane, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, to contact the police.
