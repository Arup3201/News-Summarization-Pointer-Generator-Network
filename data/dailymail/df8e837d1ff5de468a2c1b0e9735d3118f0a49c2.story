A frail woman was battered to death with a hammer after her killer tricked his way  into her home by posing as a  volunteer from the charity Age UK, a court heard yesterday.

Judith Richardson, 77, was  murdered after she opened the front door of her modest ground-floor flat to 48-year-old Graeme Jarman, the jury was told.

The pensioner, who had never  married and lived alone with her dog Hamish, was hit in the head at least 30 times by Jarman, it heard.

After bludgeoning Miss Richardson to 
death he then ransacked her bedroom before fleeing with her handbag and 
jewellery, it is claimed.

Robert Smith QC, prosecuting, said 
there was ‘compelling’ CCTV footage which showed that Jarman, who was 
jobless and living on benefits, had been stalking other elderly women in
the hours before her murder.

He had watched her walk home a day earlier and selected her as a potential victim, the court heard.

The murder last August was for no other reason than ‘personal gain’, Mr Smith told the jury.

Jarman stole a hammer from a store and
the next day walked to Miss Richardson’s home in the market town of 
Hexham on August 19, Newcastle Crown Court was told.

Jarman, who denies murder, took two 
leaflets issued by the charity Age UK, which he probably picked up in a 
shop, Mr Smith said. ‘They were no doubt produced to her at her home ...
as a means of persuading her to let him in.’

The leaflets were later found inside the hall of her home.

One of them had Jarman’s fingerprints 
on, Mr Smith said. The hammer used to kill her had been abandoned in a 
carrier bag and placed on a wall next to her home.

Mr Smith told jurors there was ‘clear 
and material evidence’ linking Jarman to the killing. As well as the 
fingerprints on the leaflets, his DNA was found on a blood-stained 
tissue in Miss Richardson’s bedroom.

On the day of the murder Miss Richardson, who had £105,000 in savings accounts, had just arrived home from the supermarket.

She had put her shopping away and was 
sitting down to have some toast when she was interrupted, the court 
heard. ‘It’s likely that the person who killed her rang her doorbell,’ 
Mr Smith said.

She was struck almost as soon as she 
opened her front door, with the blow knocking her back on to the floor 
of the hall, the court heard.

After the attack, Jarman took a bus to
Newcastle city centre where he allegedly dumped Miss Richardson’s 
handbag in a bin. The bag was later found and handed in to the police. 
Officers then discovered her body.

Over the next few hours Jarman allegedly sold her jewellery for £300 and shaved off his hair.

He was arrested two weeks later, 120 miles from Miss Richardson’s home, in Filey, North Yorkshire.

The court heard how Jarman arrived in 
Hexham two days before the murder, having ended his flat tenancy in 
Consett, County Durham, and with just £1.55 in the bank. The day before 
the attack he slept rough.

CCTV footage appeared to show him 
walking around the town centre, carrying a distinctive green bag and 
talking to elderly residents.

When he was arrested he admitted   
selling the jewellery, but claimed he had found the handbag near her 
home, as if by ‘divine intervention’.

The trial continues.
