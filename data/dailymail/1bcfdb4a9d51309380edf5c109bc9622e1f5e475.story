A gang groomed vulnerable young girls through Facebook before plying them with alcohol and raping them, a court heard yesterday.

Yasir Ali, 28, Daaim Ashraf, 19, Akash Yashin, 18, Mohammed Aslam, 24, and James Daly, 25, were involved in a sex ring spanning five years, it was said.

It was alleged that after messaging their eight female victims, who were between 13 and 16 at the time, over social media, ring leader Ali, along with Ashraf, began grooming them.

The young white girls, who cannot be 
named for legal reasons, were encouraged to meet up with the men - four 
of whom are Pakistani - and were plied with alcohol, Cambridge Crown 
Court heard.

They
 were driven around Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, by Ali - who used the 
nicknames 'Mr Nice' and 'Sketcher Pidox' on Facebook.

Mobile
 numbers would then be exchanged and the defendants, primarily Ali and 
Ashraf, would continue grooming the girls via Blackberry Messenger and 
text.

They
 would then meet up again and would go to a secluded location in cars or
 to a motel where the group of men would sexually exploit them.

The
 crown say the 'vulnerable' girls were picked out for their 'very 
difficult backgrounds' and thought they loved the gang members.

But they were 'used as sex objects' and the gang saw them as 'worthless' and 'passed the girls around'.

Opening
 the case yesterday, Patricia Lynch, prosecuting, said Ali - the oldest 
of the gang - was 'undoubtedly the primary offender'.

She said: 'The girls were flattered and complimented and if I use the colloquial term, chatted up.

'The girls would be driven from their home towns and villages and taken to Peterborough where they would be plied with alcohol en route and taken to secluded spots.

'The messages by the main two defendants became increasingly sexual.

'This resulted in the girls beginning to really like the defendants they were having contact with.

'The grooming worked and the girls in fact began to love the defendants they were contacting, thinking it was a real relationship.

'They found being driven round in flash cars, driving around Peterborough and being taken to hotels, they found that attractive.

'Because of this grooming they thought these men wanted loving relationships.'

She added: 'They thought they were respectful older men who gave them attention and that made them feel special.

'But it was quite the opposite. The girls were being quite deliberately used for sex and passed around.

'Their young age, their vulnerability, the grooming and the alcohol given to them negates any consent they could have given because it was not informed consent.

'The girls were groomed, manipulated and plied with alcohol and they were simply being used as sex objects by these defendants who simply viewed them as worthless.'

The case which is expected to last eight weeks is being heard at Cambridge Crown Court

The offences allegedly took place in 2008 and 2013 - with one in 2010.

Supermarket worker Ali is charged with six counts of rape, two counts of making indecent photographs of a child, one count of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and one count of intimidation.

Ashraf, who is a student, is charged with one count of sexual assault, three counts of rape, one count of sexual activity with a child, one count of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and one count of intimidation.

Ashraf and Ali are also jointly charged with seven counts of trafficking for sexual exploitation relating to six of the girls and Yashin is jointly charged for two of those offences.

Yashin, who is a student, is also charged with one count of sexual assault.

Aslam, who is unemployed is charged with one count of rape and one count of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and unemployed Daly is charged with one count of rape in 2008.

All five of the defendants deny all counts.

One of the first victims from 2008 said she 'really loved him' in reference to Ali, but the 'relationship' turned sour.

He is accused of pushing her to the floor and kicking her before passing her onto Daly to have sex with.

Daly, who is accused of raping her in a car 'despite her protestations', shook his head in the dock as he heard the allegation against him.

The court heard the victim got out of the car to tell Ali what had happened, but she was just told 'you're a slag anyway' and made to walk home alone.

On January 5, 2013, Ali is said to have had sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 in an alleyway while Ashraf is said to have touched a girl's breasts.

On February 2, 2013 Ali, Ashraf and Yashin allegedly took two of the girls to Days Motel in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

The ring leader allegedly filmed the other two sexually assaulting and raping their victims after giving them vodka.

A mobile phone, which was seized in May last year from Ali's home, showed the girls in their underwear engaging in sexual acts.

Footage is also said to show one girl drunk on the floor of the motel bathroom, where Ashraf is said to have sprayed her with cold water before urinating on her.

On February 16, 2013, Ali, Ashraf, and Aslam, who was known as Mr Teddy, allegedly took three of the girls to the same motel.

A 13-year-old girl is said to have watched on as the men raped the other two 14-year-old victims, the jury was told.

Cambridge Crown Court is to be shown CCTV images of the group entering the motel with the girls 'extremely drunk.'

Ms Lynch told the jury how the accused threatened to firebomb the homes of their victims if they went to police about what had happened.

She said that in May 2013, Ali and Ashraf allegedly met up with one of the victims from the incident.

They threatened her and told her to pass the message on to three of the other girls.

Mrs Lynch said: 'Threats were made by both defendants that if the girls went to court the defendants would "make their lives hell" and that their houses would be firebombed.'

One of the girls' parents told the police who arrested Ali and Ashraf.

The trial continues and is expected to last eight weeks.
