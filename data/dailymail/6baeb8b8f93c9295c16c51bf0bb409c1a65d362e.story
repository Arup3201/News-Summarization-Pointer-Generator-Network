Ravel Morrison's tumultuous time at West Ham has officially come to an end after his contract was terminated by the club.

It means the troubled 22-year-old, who has signed a pre-contract agreement with Lazio, is a free agent.

However, the midfielder cannot represent another club this season as he has played in two countries - England and Wales - this term and FIFA don't allow a third.

'West Ham United can confirm that the Club have reached agreement with Ravel Morrison to terminate his contract with immediate effect,' a statement from the Upton Park outfit reads on their official club website.

'The 22-year-old midfielder joined West Ham in January 2012 and made 24 appearances in his three years at the Club, scoring five goals.

'The Hammers would like to wish Ravel every success in his future career.'

Morrison only made two appearances under Hammers boss Sam Allardyce this season; with his last outing coming in a 3-1 home defeat to Southampton back on August 31. 

A series of disciplinary problems had hampered his progress at Upton Park and he was loaned to Birmingham, Queens Park Rangers and Cardiff City - with his three-month deal at the latter cut short earlier in December.

Appearances: 81

Goals: 14

Honours: FA Youth Cup (2011) 

However, the England Under 21 international will now look to resume his career with Serie A club Lazio.

In January reports in Italy, suggested that a three-year offer of £500,000 a year plus bonuses had been offered to Morrison.

The 22-year-old travelled to Italy last month to have a medical and complete his move from West Ham, before releasing a picture of a Lazio shirt with his name on the back and the caption: 'Ravel 4' via his Instagram account.

Other Premier League clubs also enquired about the Manchester United's academy graduate but he favoured a move abroad.

Upon his breakthrough at United, the club described Morrison as having the 'potential to be one of the real stars of his generation' with former legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson a firm admirer of his talents. 

But the then-champions let him go in January 2012 after a contract dispute.
