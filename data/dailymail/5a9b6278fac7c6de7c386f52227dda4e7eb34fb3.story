West Brom head coach Alan Irvine has warned potential suitors Saido Berahino is worth more than £15million.

The red-hot striker is the top scoring Englishman in the Barclays Premier League with five goals and helped fire England Under 21s to Euro 2015 this month.

Tottenham had been linked with a £15million move but Irvine dismissed the amount - insisting Berahino would cost much more in today's market.

'It doesn't sound a lot. I would be absolutely astonished if anyone could sign Saido from us for £15million,' he said.

'You look at some of the fees going around in the transfer market that's just been, everybody seems to start at £7million.

'Ross McCormack went for £11million Championship to Championship. What the right figure is I have absolutely no idea and I wouldn't make the decision as far as that was concerned.

'But £15million doesn't sound like a lot of money for a talented, young, English player with great potential who is playing really, really well in the Premier League at the moment and who is scoring goals. It would have to be higher than that.

'It was a seller's market in this particular transfer window. We know as we kept going to try to buy people and we realised how difficult that was.'

Irvine would not welcome any offers but believes Berahino can handle any speculation and it will not harm his performances.

'I have had a few conversations with him where it's been a case of 'You keep doing what you are doing and everything will happen for you',' he said, ahead of Monday's visit of Manchester United.

'But he is going to have to deal with that speculation. I don't think there are any alarm bells ringing for me at this particular time and if I saw a change in behaviour or anything like that I would probably have a little word with him.'

But Irvine admitted, should the 21-year-old continue his fine form, interest and bids are inevitable.

'That's something which could happen, there's no question about that but I don't want him to play poorly so that they don't come,' he said.

'I am desperate for him to play really well and if that means other clubs come and start knocking on the door then the club will make a decision on whether these clubs are making the right kind of offers or not.

'If Gareth Bale can be prised away from Tottenham I think it means every player has got his price.'

Meanwhile, Baggies skipper Chris Brunt is winning his fitness fight to face Manchester United.

The midfielder suffered a groin injury on international duty with Northern Ireland and missed their wins over the Faroe Islands and Greece.

Silvestre Varela (groin) and Claudio Yacob (personal reasons) will not feature against Louis Van Gaal's side at The Hawthorns on Monday, but Irvine has been boosted by Brunt's progress.

He said: 'Chris Brunt was the only man who came back and he came back early. Fortunately for us that's given us time to work with him and he hasn't trained with us yet but he will join in on Saturday.

'I'm expecting everyone who came back to be in contention for the game on Monday.'

Gareth McAuley and Chris Baird played for Northern Ireland while James Morrison helped Scotland beat Georgia and draw in Poland.
