The customised Captain America chopper Peter Fonda rode in 1969 classic 'Easy Rider' came to symbolise the counter-culture movement of the 1960s, and riding it has been described as like 'going out with Marilyn Monroe.

Now, the iconic stars-and-stripes Harley-Davidson is going up for auction, and is expected to fetch between $1million-$1.2million, because it is the only one which remains from filming, and was used in the famous climactic  scene, in which Fonda is thrown from the bike.

The seller is Michael Eisenberg, a California businessman who once co-owned a Los Angeles motorcycle-themed restaurant with Fonda and 'Easy Rider' co-star Dennis Hopper.

The bike is the only one remaining from filming and is one of the most recognisable motorcycles of all time

Mr Eisenberg bought it last year from National Motorcycle Museum and Dan Haggerty - perhaps best known for his roles in the 'Grizzly Adams' TV show and movies - who was in charge of keeping the custom-designed bike humming during the 1969 movie's filming.

The gleaming panhead chopper with chromed hardtail frame is accompanied by three letters of authenticity. One is signed by the National Motorcycle Museum, where it was displayed for 12 years. Another is from Fonda and a third from Haggerty.

The bike features a forward-angled front wheel and handlebars, fishtail exhaust pipes and a teardrop-shaped gas tank where the protagonists stashed their cash. It was designed with input from Fonda who insisted on it being decorated with the American flag.

The bike was a central part of the film, which was about two drug-using bikers who went on a cross-country journey from Los Angeles to New Orleans to discover the real America

'Easy Rider' (1969) is a classic road film about two drug-using, long-haired bikers, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper), who go on a cross-country odyssey from Los Angeles to New Orleans in search of personal freedom and easy money.

Four motorcycles were created for the movie, but only one is known to have survived. It was used in the final scene, when Billy is shot by a redneck, and Wyatt is blown from his bike while rushing to get help after the gas tank is shot.

The film ends with the flaming bike set in the middle of the deserted road. 

'Three of the motorcycles were stolen, even before the movie was released, which was a sign of the overwhelming power that these motorcycles had,' said Haggerty. 'They were never recovered.'

The bike is being sold by auction house Profiles in History both online and at its California galleries

After the film was finished, Hopper told Haggerty to keep it. Haggerty rode it often, an experience he likened to 'going out with Marilyn Monroe'. Parting with it was like having a 'child finally getting married and moving away and starting a new life on their own', he said.

That new life was at the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa, Iowa, run by a friend of Haggerty's. When the museum decided to sell it last year, Mr Eisenberg jumped at the chance to buy it.

An 'Easy Rider' fan since childhood, Mr Eisenberg ran the Thunder Road House in West Hollywood with Fonda and Hopper in the 1990s, until it burnt down due to an electrical fire. For years he had wanted to buy the bike from Haggerty, and then the museum.

'I always wanted to own it,' he said. 'But once it sunk in that I actually had it, then I realised how important it was.'

He added: 'The public needs to see it. It's that iconic. It needs to be on a podium.'

Eisenberg said he plans to donate 'a significant amount' of the proceeds to the American Humane Association to honour Fonda's involvement with the organization.

The auction is being held by Profiles in History online and at its galleries in Calabasas, California on October 18.
