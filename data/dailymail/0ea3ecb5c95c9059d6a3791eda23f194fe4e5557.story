Mick Jagger has caused outrage after making a tasteless joke at Wednesday night’s Sandy benefit where he compared the killer superstorm to London rain.

During his set at Madison Square Garden, the Rolling Stones' frontman made the thoughtless remark in front of an audience including storm survivors and emergency crews who responded in the devastating aftermath.

Jagger said: 'This has got to be the largest collection of old English musicians ever assembled in Madison Square Garden. But I’ve got to say, if it rains in London, you’ve got to come and help us, OK?'

The powerful storm left parts of New York City underwater and left millions of people in several states without heat or electricity for weeks.

The superstorm is responsible for at least 140 deaths, including 104 in New York and New Jersey, and it destroyed or damaged 305,000 housing units in New York alone. Rebuilding is expected to reach the $70billion mark.

Fans took to Twitter to express their anger and dismay at Jagger's remarks.

One user, @dwbohle, tweeted: 'Wait wait wait...did Mick Jagger say if it rains in London we should help them? Was it raining during WWII?'

'Anyone else think Jagger’s ''If it 
rains in London, you guys have to help us'' line was a bit 
out-of-bounds?” asked @OakParkVandy.

BenPurzak68 added: 'Not a big fan of the stones. Especially after what Mick jagger said about we have to help now when it rains in London. D***.'

Despite his ill-advised remarks, 
Jagger and band mates Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts wowed
the crowd of thousands who had packed out Madison Square Garden in 
midtown Manhattan.

The
Rolling Stones, who are celebrating half a century making music, were 
joined at the glittering event by legends including Bruce Springsteen, 
Paul McCartney, The Who, Bon Jovi and Billy Joel.

Before
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band kicked off the show with the 
Land of Hope and Dreams, the crowd were shown a video montage of how the
super storm descended on the east coast, damaging everything in its 
path.

Devastated residents of hardest-hit 
areas like Staten Island and Far Rockaway were shown sitting on piles of rubble 
with tears running down their faces as the realization they lost 
everything hit home.

One woman cried: 'I just want to go home, but it's 
not there any more.'

Swept away: In the wake of Sandy, only the flooded foundations of some homes were left like in the Staten Island neighborhood of Oakwood

But promises of 'We Will Rebuild' 
dominated the night as scores of music legends performed in front of 
tens of thousands of people with all proceeds going to help the victims.

An estimated $35million was raised in ticket sales alone.

While
top artists performed on stage, actors and comedians such as James 
Gandolfini, Jimmy Fallon and Jack McBrayer manned phone banks where they
accepted donations from viewers.

Through television, live streams, the
radio and theater simulcasts, an estimated two billion people around the 
world were given the chance to experience the concert live.
