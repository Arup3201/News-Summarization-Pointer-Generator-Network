Living in Florida, it is not uncommon to spot an alligator swimming in a creek or resting on the shore of a lake on any given day, but even a seasoned trapper was caught off guard when he got a call about a 14-foot reptile.

Lane Stephens, a contracted alligator trapper with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC), said he pulled the scaly monster out of Lake Talquin on August 11, making it the fourth critter to exceed 11 feet in the last few months.

Stephens has been catching and harvesting gators for the state agency for three years, and said that his initial reaction to the size of the animal was shock.

‘I didn’t know it was as large as it was,’ he told the Tallahassee Democrat. ‘I knew it was an extremely large gator because the complainant had told me it was an extremely large alligator (that had come onto her property).

‘I didn’t know exactly how big until we got him back to the boat landing and started trying to load him in my truck. Nobody is going to load a gator that size into their boat.’

At 14 feet, Stephens’ latest catch rivals the longest alligator ever trapped in Florida, which was a male reptile measuring at 14 feet and three-and-a-half inches that was captured in Lake Washington, according to FWC spokesman Stan Kirkland.

Kirkland said there are estimated 1.3 million gators living in Florida. Under the FWC’s policy, alligators measuring more than four feet in length are harvested – or killed - for hide, meat and skulls.

Danger zone: The behemoth gator was pulled out of Lake Talquin 10 miles west of Tallahassee

Stephens caught the alligator using a baited line, which only contract nuisance trappers with the FWC are allowed to use under state law.

According to the trapper, it took about two hours to harvest the gator from the time it took the bait, WCTV reported.

Lake Talquin is located on the Ochlockonee River between Leon County and Gadsden County about 10 miles west of Tallahassee. People are not advised to swim there due to the lake’s dangerous fauna.

Kirkland said some 20,000 alligators are harvested in Florida each year. Gator hunting season lasts from August 15 to November 1.
