Too pretty for prison? Stéphanie Beaudoin was arrested last month and has been charged with 114 counts including theft and owning an illegal cache of nine firearms

Not alone: Beaudoin allegedly worked with three underage accomplices to break in to 42 homes in the Athabaska and Maple areas

Canadian authorities believe Beaudoin worked with three underage accomplices - ages 13, 15 and 17 - to burgle residence in the Athabaska and Maple areas. 

The nursing student and her cohorts allegedly broke into the homes using the back door or basement windows. 

Last week, the Crown filed even more charges against Beaudoin, bringing the total up to a staggering 114 counts.

She faces charges of breaking and entering, receiving stolen property, as well as illegally owning and storing a cache of nine firearms.

Gunslinger: Beaudoin is also facing charges for illegally owning a storing a cache of nine weapons, which police discovered in the back of her car  

Police found the guns in the back of Beaudoin's white Mitsubishi Lancer.

'The record is impressive. I was given a document that [is] at least 12 inches thick,' her lawyer Denis Lavigne told La Nouvelle Union newspaper.

Mr Lavigne says his client has seen a doctor to determine her mental state during the time of the robberies.  

Beaudoin is due back in court on November 17.

Pictures have also been published to a Facebook fan page, which describes Beaudoin as a 'news personality'

The Facebook page has so far received more than 2,000 likes

A Facebook fan page, describing Beaudoin as a 'news personality', has received more than 2,000 likes. 

Since pictures of Beaudoin were published online, Twitter users have dubbed her the newest world's sexiest criminal 

'Stephanie Beaudoin will steal your heart, then your stuff,' one Twitter user wrote. 

Beaudoin is just the latest in a series of extremely attractive convicts to captivate the internet.

First there was Meagan McCullough, a Florida mother who was arrested in July 2010 after a DUI.

Her resulting tearful mugshot in an orange jumpsuit spurned several memes including one thatsaid 'I guess it's true...looks do kill'.

Earlier this summer another mugshot was released, showing the ex-convict Jeremy Meeks after his arrest for felony firearm possession in Stockton, California.

Meeks' smoldering looks and steel-blue eyes made him a national sensation.

In June, Meeks' lawyer told MailOnline that his client was in talks with top fashion designers to dress him for his trial. 

Reports that he was offered a $30,000 modeling contract were ultimately unfounded, his talent manager said.
