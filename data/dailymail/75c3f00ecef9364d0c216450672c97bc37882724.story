Steve Way celebrated with his first pint of lager for three months after breaking a 35-year-old British record to finish 10th in the Commonwealth Games marathon.

The bank worker from Bournemouth weighed 16-and-a-half stone seven years ago, but has given up his ‘couch potato lifestyle’ — smoking 20 days cigarettes a day, boozing and eating junk food — to shed nearly half his body weight and take his place among the elite.

The 40-year-old’s time of 2hr 15min 16sec yesterday smashed Ron Hill’s 1979 best for over-40s. Way was the second British man home after Scotland’s Derek Hawkins, who finished ninth.

Personal best: Steve Way completed a remarkable turnaround by finishing 10th in the marathon

Post-race recovery: Way used to weigh more than 16st and smoke 20 cigarettes a day before changing his lifestyle to become a marathon runner

Pleased: Steve Way tweeted shortly after the race describing it as the 'Best day ever'

Going the distance: Steve Way will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

‘I need to go have a drink and I’m not talking about water,’ said Way. ‘I’m going to have a pint or few as I haven’t had one for three months.

‘I can’t go completely off the rails because I’ve got a 90-kilometre (55-mile) race in Sweden at the end of August.

‘I’m absolutely delighted. This is the best day ever. Running is normally second place to my wedding day but this one matches it.

‘My wife Sarah won’t mind because my goals were top 10, personal best, British record and I’ve managed all three so I’ve couldn’t have hoped for a better day.

‘I hope I’m an inspiration. There are quite a few people out there that say they are getting themselves off the couch, getting out the door and seeing whether there is a marathon runner hidden underneath that couch potato.’

Way’s England team-mates Nicholas Torry, 37, and Ben Moreau, 32, finished 13th and 14th respectively. Australia’s Michael Shelley, who never bothers to look at a marathon course before he runs it, won gold with a time of 2hr 11min 15sec.

Shelley, 30, won silver in Delhi four years ago in only his second outing over 26.2miles and on Sunday became the second man after Steve Moneghetti, Australia’s chef de mission in Glasgow, to reach the podium in consecutive Commonwealth Games.

Turnaround: Steve Way was overweight and unhealthy before he changed his life through running

Shelley took up running because his parents did not want him to play contact sports after he was born with a hole in his diaphragm. The Australian said: ‘To come back and win now I’ve got a bit more experience is indescribable. It was a dream. I can’t believe it.’ Stephen Chemlany finished 43secs behind Shelley. He won Kenya’s first medal of these Games, but there were two more shortly afterwards in the women’s marathon as Flomena Cheyech Daniel, 32, took gold and Caroline Kilel, 33, won silver.

Scotland’s Susan Partridge was the first British runner home in sixth place, with England’s Louise Damen seventh and Amy Whitehead ninth. The third English runner, Alyson Dixon, retired with a calf injury.
