Four loggerhead sea turtles were taken to a Virginia park and returned to the ocean after they washed up seven months ago in Massachusetts.

The loggerhead turtles were escorted by a team from the New England Aquarium, who searched for 70-degree water - which would be warm enough for the turtles' safe return home, according a report by the Boston Globe.

The turtles were hypothermic last year when they ended up on Cape Cod.

The four loggerheads, who weigh between 40 and 100 pounds, were eventually taken to Assateague Island National Seashore in Virgina, the paper said.

Once taken out, the turtles trekked 25 yards on the sand toward the water - as a crowd of around 200 kept watch.

Scientists placed satellites on two of the turtles to track their movements in the next six to nine months, the Globe said.

The returned turtles were the last members of a group of over 85 that washed up last year on Cape Cod, the paper reported.

Loggerhead sea turtles range in size between 34 and 49 inches long, the aquarium says on its website, and can live between 30 to 50 years.
