The party company that made the Duchess of Cambridge's parents multi-millionaires has paid thousands to charity after they were sanctioned for breaching environmental rules, it emerged today.

Party Pieces handed £12,650 to the Woodland Trust for apparently failing 'to ensure packaging is recycled in the UK'.

In Britain companies with sales of more than £2million must comply with Britain's Packaging Waste Regulations, but it appears the Middletons did not not realise.

Breach: Carole and Michael Middleton, pictured last month at Prince George's christening, have made millions from Party Pieces, which has now made a substantial donation to charity after a recycling rule breach

Success: Party Pieces sells party items and fancy dress around the world online but was first run by Mrs Middleton from the family's kitchen table in 1987

Rather than be taken to court by the Environment Agency, and fined, the company instead opted to make a charitable donation.

The Woodland Trust has strong links with the royal family, having asked Britain to 'come together' to plant six million new trees for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in 2012.

'Party 
Pieces appears to have broken environmental laws aimed to ensure 
packaging is recycled in the UK,' Steve Eminton, editor of letsrecycle.com told the Daily Telegraph.

'Rather than facing a court appearance 
and a potential fine, the business has taken advantage of an option 
given to it by the Environment Agency of making a donation to charity.

'I would hope that Michael and Carole recycle more in the future
and adopt a greener approach to their business activities.'

The Telegraph claims that Party Pieces has now joined Paperpak, a package recycling scheme, which would have saved them thousands had they done so earlier.

A spokesman for the company said: 'In 2012 it came to our attention that
due to a misunderstanding we were breaching one of the guidelines. 
Party Pieces corrected this error immediately and is now fully compliant
with the Packaging Waste Regulations.'

Despite the success of Party Pieces, The Middletons have been accused of cashing in on their royal connections.

When Kate was pregnant their website offered miniature castles, ‘prince’ and ‘princess’ banners and balloons are among the other royal baby-themed products.

The website, set up by Carole Middleton in 1987 also offered paraphernalia themed around the Royal Wedding and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Its street party items included state carriage-shaped cardboard teapot vases, coat of arms cups printed with ‘Long Live G&T’ and canape flags featuring crown-wearing corgis.

The company – which Mrs Middleton started from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table – also had a dispute with Britain’s Got Talent after using the show’s logo on the site without permission and on another occasion fell foul of strict advertising laws covering the London Olympics.

It also rowed with Bond film producers Eon Productions after using the logo for the latest James Bond film, Skyfall.

Although accounts for the company are not publicly available, it is clearly a success for the Middletons, who recently bought a £4.7million country home and put their three children through private school.
