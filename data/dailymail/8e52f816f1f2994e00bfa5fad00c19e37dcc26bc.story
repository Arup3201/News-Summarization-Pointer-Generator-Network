A sickening video of an Arsenal fan and his three-year-old son singing a vile song about Robin Van Persie has been posted online.

His father films the youngster in his Gunners top and leads him in a song referring to the Dutch striker's arrest in 2005 after a false allegation of rape was made against him.

In the 38-second clip, the boy, named as Kye, also calls the Manchester United striker a c***.

Shocking: The young Arsenal fan filmed singing about Robin Van Persie referring to the Dutch striker's arrest in 2005 after a false allegation of rape was made against him

The pair sing: 'She said no, Robin, she said no' three times while the dad ends the video by chanting 'The Arsenal'.

The clip comes as various incidents have shocked the football community in recent weeks including a brawl at an England Serbia match involving English players and coach and the investigation of a referee accused of using 'inappropriate language'.

The song sung in the clip refers to Van Persie's arrest in 2005 when was held for two days accused of raping a beauty queen in Rotterdam, but the case was later thrown out.

The shocking clip comes after Van Persie joined fierce rival team Manchester United in a £24million deal in August.

The 29-year-old signed a 
£250,000-a-week deal at Old Trafford and last weekend scored against his
former side in a 2-1 win, angering fans.

Arsenal fans ignored the pre-match 
plea of manager Arsene Wenger to respect their former hero — the 
Dutchman scored an incredible 37 goals for the Gunners last season — and
booed Van Persie at every touch.

Angered fans: Robin Van Persie celebrates the 2-1 win last Saturday to Manchester United after Arsenal fans booed him when he scored a goal against his previous team of eight years

Goal against his old team: Van Persie scores past Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen during the match last Saturday but Van Persie did not celebrate the win so as to not antagonise Arsenal fans further

The striker did not antagonise the crowd further by celebrating his goal but insisted his big day 
had gone like a dream.

Van Persie told Sky Sports: 'I think it speaks for itself. I played there eight years and had a fantastic time there. I have respect for the fans, the players, the manager and the whole club.'

Van Persie moved to Manchester United in August after signing a four-year contract.

Speaking at his official unveiling press conference in August, he said: 'In these situations, when you have to make a hard decision in your life, I always listen to that little boy inside me. What does he want? That boy was screaming for Manchester United.

'Everyone knows me by now. I love football. I am quite principled in that perspective. It is always difficult to find the perfect match but I do feel this is the perfect match for me.'

Last month, Chelsea fan Gavin Kirkham was named 
on social networking sites after he was caught making an apparent monkey
gesture at Manchester United striker Danny Welback during the Wednesday
night game. Chelsea and the police have launched investigations into 
the incident while Kirkham, 28, from Letchworth Garden City in 
Hertfordshire, claims he is not a racist.

Troubles also flared at an England 
Serbia match on October 16 when a mass brawl broke out at the end of the
game in Krusevac involving England Under 21 international Steven 
Caulker, Tom Ince and coach Steve Wigley. Missiles were thrown and 
things turned ugly as some fans got on to the pitch, while there were 
clashes involving players and staff from both teams.

The Football Association are waiting to hear from Serbia about what criminal charges have been laid against them.

Referee Mark Clattenburg has decided not to referee a match for a second weekend running as he prepares to answer accusations from Chelsea as the Football Association investigate a complaint that the match official used 'inappropriate language' towards John Obi Mikel during a game against Manchester United, which is understood to have been interpreted as being racist.
