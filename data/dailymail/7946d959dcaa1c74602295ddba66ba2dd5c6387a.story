Patrice Evra was all smiles on Sunday during France's training session ahead of the World Cup after signing a one-year extension on his Manchester United contract.

The left-back was rumoured to be leaving Old Trafford this summer for Inter Milan, but the club announced in the week that he would be staying for another year.

Bacary Sagna's future at Arsenal is still unclear, with Manchester City close to a deal for the right-back. He looked in focused mood alongside Rio Mavuba, as Didier Deschamps stepped up preparations for the tournament.

Tottenham's Hugo Lloris was also in action in Clairefontaine, with friendlies against Norway, Paraguay and Jamaica to come.

France face Honduras on June 15 in Porto Alegre, with Switzerland and Ecuador the other teams in Group E.
