On trial: Daniel Pytlarz is accused of sexually assaulting 18 female clients, including a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney

A masseur groped a woman as she lay naked at his clinic then offered her a loyalty card when the ordeal was over, a court heard today.

Daniel Pytlarz, 34, left his victim fearing she would be raped after he ordered her to strip off her underwear at his upmarket spa in St John's Wood, North London, it was claimed.

The woman, who cannot be named, visited for her first ever massage after booking discounted treatment through a health and beauty website, Southwark Crown Court was told.

Giving evidence, she told jurors she had visited the clinic in March last year.

She said she had been asked to undress by the masseur and had taken her clothes off but left her bra and underpants on before Pytlarz asked her to remove them.

'I was a bit surprised,' she added. 'I was not sure why I had to take my undergarments off but as I had never had a massage before I just thought, "OK, this is what is supposed to happen".'

But she began to fear for her safety after Pytlarz groped her while she was lying naked on the massage table, the court heard.

'I was actually thinking I hope I get out of this,' she said.

'I wear glasses, I could not see properly and I was naked and did not know how I could get to the door and get my clothes and up the stairs before he got to the door.

'I have a bad back and I thought if I try and get off the bed then my back is going to go and it is all going to be terrible.

'I thought I was going to be raped.'

Ordeal: The woman, whose new husband had booked a massage for her birthday in November 2010, said she had asked Pytlarz for a deep full-body massage but 'completely froze' when he touched her intimately

When Pytlarz stopped and asked her if she wanted it to continue she said, 'No, thank you'.

She said: 'I got dressed and went upstairs.

'He said he hoped I had not minded what had happened because I seemed very tense and then he gave me a loyalty card.

Cancelled appointment: When Sir Paul McCartney's aide told him about the alleged assault he immediately cancelled his and wife Nancy Shevell's appointment with Pytlarz

'I just said, "OK, thanks", and then left.'

Pytlarz is also said to have sexually assaulted two lawyers who attended his spa together in January 2011.

Both had also booked treatment through the Wahanda.com health and beauty website.

One said she and her friend had made the appointments as 'something nice' for them to do together before a meal with their boyfriends.

She told jurors that after Pytlarz had touched her intimately while massaging her legs, she had wanted to alert her friend but had been surrounded by the masseur and a female employee.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'I wanted to say something to warn her but they were both standing there so I just said, "Enjoy your massage, I will see you later".'

Her friend added: 'I do not remember specifics I just remember two very poignant moments of the massage that have stayed with me.

'He was massaging up and down my calf and the bottom of my leg and then up my thigh.

'I've had my legs massaged before and usually people stop at the top of your legs - a good couple of inches from your bikini line or where your pants start.

'That was not the case here.'

Among his other victims - of which there are believed to be 18 in total - Pytlarz is said to have targeted a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney, who claimed he touched her intimately when he gave her a free massage at his clinic in December 2009.

It happened the day before he was due to give a massage to the ex-Beatle and his girlfriend Nancy Shevell, who is now his wife, at home in Cavendish Avenue, less than half a mile from the masseur's clinic.

When the employee told Sir Paul what had happened he cancelled the appointment, jurors have been told.

Pytlarz, from St John's Wood, denies seven counts of assault by penetration and 14 counts of sexual assault.

All the offences are alleged to have taken place between March 2009 and September 2011.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
