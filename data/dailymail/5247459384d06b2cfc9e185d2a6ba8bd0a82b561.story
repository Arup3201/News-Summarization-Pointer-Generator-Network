A Harvard professor took to the podium at a finance conference Friday and called major influencer of modern economics John Maynard Keynes wrong about his philosophies because he was gay and childless.

During a question and answer session in Carlsbad, California, well-known historian Niall Ferguson was asked how he felt about the theories of English economist John Maynard Keynes versus those of Edmund Burke.

What the prominent Obama critic said in response hushed the crowd of over 500.

According to Tom Kostigen, editor-at-large of Financial Advisor magazine, Ferguson made it clear that he believed Keynes was uninterested in the what was good for society, basically because of his sexual orientation.

‘Ferguson asked the audience how many children Keynes had,’ wrote Kostigen in Financial Advisor. ‘He explained that Keynes had none because he was a homosexual and was married to a ballerina, with whom he likely talked of "poetry" rather than procreated.’

Kostigen said many of the audience members took offense at the remark, but that Ferguson continued.

‘Ferguson, author of The Great Degeneration: How Institutions Decay and Economies Die,' wrote Kostigen, ‘says it's only logical that Keynes would take this selfish worldview because he was an "effete" member of society.’

It is worth noting that, though many conservatives use the term ‘Keynesian economics’ as derogatory, Keynes was not wholly liberal.

Keynes, whose most famous quote is ‘In the long run we are all dead,’ once called the market system the ‘best safeguard of the variety of life’ that preserved the ‘most secure and successful choices of former generations.’

However, rather than to Keynes’ ‘selfish worldview,’ Kostigen wrote that Ferguson endeared himself during the Q&A to Burke’s ‘social contract,’ a term used largely by liberals today.

Ferguson, a conservative former advisor to John McCain, has been a vocal critic of the Obama presidency from its beginnings. Perhaps most notably, the historian wrote a Newsweek cover story in the months before the 2012 presidential campaign entitled ‘Hit the Road, Barack,’ that many, including New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, criticized for misrepresenting facts.

Since Kostigen’s May 3 post, the story has spread quickly across the web.

Business Insider called Ferguson’s remarks ‘bizarre and offensive’ and the Huffington post reported that many, including Reuters finance blogger Felix Salmon, were quick to condemn them.

On Saturday, Ferguson took to his personal website’s blog to make an ‘unqualified apology’ for his earlier comments.

‘I should not have suggested,’ wrote Ferguson, ‘that Keynes was indifferent to the long run because he had no children, nor that he had no children because he was gay. This was doubly stupid. First, it is obvious that people who do not have children also care about future generations. Second, I had forgotten that Keynes’s wife Lydia miscarried.

‘My disagreements with Keynes’s economic philosophy have never had anything to do with his sexual orientation.’

Ferguson went on to apologize to his colleagues, students, and friends ‘straight and gay’ who have every right to be disappointed.’

According to his website, Ferguson is the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of History at Harvard University; a Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University; and a Senior Research Fellow at Jesus College, Oxford.
