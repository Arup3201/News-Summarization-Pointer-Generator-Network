Kirsty Taylor sleeps under a Frozen bed spread in a room jam-packed with products from the Disney movie. She loves to dress up as Queen Elsa and has seen the film so many times she knows all the words.

She sounds like every other five-year-old in the country. But Kirsty isn't a little girl - she's 21.

She's spent £1,000 on her haul of goodies, which includes a £100 custom-made glittery blue dress just like the one worn by Queen Elsa.

Frozen fan Kirsty Taylor appears on This Morning with her boyfriend Jake Martin, who she makes dress up as the Disney character Kristoff

She also has an outfit for her dog - named Elsa of course - and makes her boyfriend, Jake Martin, 20, dress up as the character Kristoff. 

The former drama student has even turned her love of the film into a career. 

Until recently, she worked as a sales rep for the Disney Store and has now set up her own business dressing up as Elsa to attend children's parties and schools. 

Explaining her obsession on today's This Morning, Kirsty, from Rotherham, said: 'I was obsessed from the trailers. I remember seeing the trailers and being desperate to go to the cinema to see it because I was so excited.

'When I first saw it, I loved the story, the music, the characters - especially Elsa. She's not your typical Disney princess, she wasn't going out to find her true love.'

Kirsty admitted the film helped her through a difficult period in her life.

'At the time I was suffering from severe depression and locked away in my room. 

'Elsa's character inspired me, she gave me hope. She was battling demons like I was battling my own. I know it's a film but I thought if she can do it, I can.'

Kirsty said she can 'really relate' to the character because of the way she 'battles her demons'

Not going to let him go: Kirsty said Jake is her Prince Charming

She added in an interview with The Sun that she can 'really relate' to Elsa - voiced by Idina Menzel in the animated film - who struggles to control a magical power that turns things into ice.

Kirsty said: 'She is my ultimate role model. I don't know what I'd do without Frozen. It's taken over all aspects of my life.'  

When the film was first released in 2013, Kirsty was single and wanted to find a Prince Charming of her own. 

'I needed my own Kristoff and then Jake came along,' she said.

Jake joined her on today's This Morning and admitted that when Kirsty puts the film on (again): 'I try and keep myself otherwise occupied.'

But he is willing to dress up as Kristoff in a £50 outfit she bought him - even though it means he gets 'stick from my mates'.
