A childless couple desperate to adopt has told of their heartbreak after being duped by a woman who pretended to be pregnant, even calling them claiming she was in the delivery room giving birth.

Mark and Tracy Dziekanski from Illinois, who are unable to have a baby of their own and could not afford to adopt in the traditional way, posted an heartfelt appeal on the Craigslist website.

They were soon contacted by a woman called Heather Taylor from North Carolina who said she was expecting a baby, but could to afford to keep it and was looking for a 'nice couple' to take care of it.

The delighted Dziekanskis thought their dream had come true and  agreed to support Taylor through the course of her pregnancy, promising her financial support.

Over the next few weeks, heartless Taylor continued to string them along, sending them photographs of her posing with a mocked-up baby bump and giving regular reports on her supposed 'condition'.

Then one day Mrs Dziekanski received a 
call from Taylor who said she had gone into labour and was speaking to 
them from the delivery room.

Taylor told them she was going to have a C-section and moments later played them a recording of a baby crying down to the phone to embellish the lie.

In an interview with ABC News, Mrs Dziekanski recalled: 'She's having a C-section, and I'm ... on the phone with her in the delivery room.

'You could hear like ... the heart rate and everything, like she was really at a hospital. ... Then a couple of minutes later, there's a baby crying.'

Taylor told the Dziekanskis that she had given birth to a baby girl and had named her Anna Rosemarie. She sent them a picture of a baby and promised to bring her to Illinois to meet her new parents.

The Dziekanskis had been completely taken in and were overjoyed at the prospect of finally becoming parents. But before long they began to realise something was wrong.

For a start, the photos Taylor was sending them of their daughter didn't appear to be of the same baby.

Later Taylor told them she was in 
Illinois and staying at a hotel close to their home, but said she had to
 rush back home because her brother had been involved in an accident.

Finally Taylor got in touch saying she had changed her mind and was going to keep the baby.

The Dziekanskis went back onto 
Craigslist and contacted other people who had posted adverts looking to 
adopt children, asking them if they had come across anyone called 
Heather Taylor.

It 
turned out she had played exactly the same trick on a woman from North 
Carolina, who just like the Dziekanskis had been promised a baby.

'I’ll never forgive her,' Mark Dziekanski said.

According to the North Carolina police,Taylor received less than $2,000 in total from both couples.

When contacted by ABC, Taylor said she hadn't done it for the money saying she did it for attention and to feel wanted.

Taylor was sentenced to between 6 and 17 months in jail, which was later reduced to 36 months probation.

She was also ordered to undergo mental treatment.

Mark and Tracy Dziekanski say they  now have a fostering license and hope to adopt children through the fostering process.
