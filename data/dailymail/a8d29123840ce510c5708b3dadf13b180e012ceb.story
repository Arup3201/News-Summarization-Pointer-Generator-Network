A businessman accused of raping a drunken woman at a five-star hotel today has been acquitted after his lawyer claimed the woman got herself 'into a silly position'. 

Mohammed Aneizi had sex with the woman at his suite at the luxurious Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington, west London, after swigging champagne with her at a West End nightclub. 

The 26-year-old was cleared of two counts of rape following a trial at Isleworth Crown Court in which his lawyer referred to the 'recipe for disaster' party lifestyle of some young women.

Aneizi was accused of raping the woman after taking her back to the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington following a night out. 

He denied the charges throughout, and was today acquitted of one count of rape. 

Speaking before the jury returned its verdict, his lawyer referred to the party lifestyle of some young women.  

'You have to wonder about club culture - it's a recipe for disaster,' said Davis Osbourne. 

'These girls are able to go out week after week, night after night, and not spend a penny.

'Promoters are able to get them into the clubs by handing out free drinks and entry. This was 0-60mph drunkenness.

'Mr Aneizi and this lady got themselves into silly positions that night, and would have made very different choices if they were both sober.'

The court heard how the businessman kissed the woman at the nightclub, and that she insisted on coming home with him. 

'She was very drunk, and when drunk made a decision to have sex with my client.

'She walked into the hotel of her own steam,' Mr Osbourne added. 

The pair had sex in his hotel room after the woman fell during the journey from the nightclub, the court heard. 

Following the encounter she fell asleep in the bathroom, with Mr Aneizi continuing his evening with guests in the lounge of his suite. 

Gurkhan Suleyman then attempted to rape the woman in the bathroom, throwing £20 notes over her body as she lay in the foetal position, the court heard. 

The gold-toothed 28-year-old, whom Mr Aneizi said he only met that evening, was convicted of attempted rape.  

He will be sentenced on November 21.
