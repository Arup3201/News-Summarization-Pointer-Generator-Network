American Horror Story actress Jamie Brewer has become the first woman with Down syndrome to walk the runway at New York Fashion Week.

The 30-year-old strutted the catwalk in designer Carrie Hammer’s show on Thursday morning wearing a bespoke ensemble which was inspired by her roles on the popular FX horror series. 

'Young girls and even young women… [see me] and say: "Hey, if she can do it so can I,"' Miss Brewer told Today. 'It’s a true inspiration being a role model for any young women to [encourage them] in being who they are and showing who they are.'

Miss Brewer walked in Miss Hammer's fashion show as a part of the designer's Role Models Not Runway Models campaign, which she first began after being asked to show her collection at New York Fashion Week last year.

'I called up my existing clients who were all incredible women and one of them happened to be a doctor and a sex therapist who happened to be in wheelchair,' Miss Hammer told the outlet. 'It was never intended to be this incredible statement.'

After Dr Danielle Sheypuk became the first woman to 'walk' the runway in a wheelchair, hundreds of people reached out to Miss Hammer to thank her, including campaigner Katie Driscoll, who runs a nonprofit organization which advocates for the inclusion of people with disabilities in the media. 

Miss Driscoll, who was a co-founder of Changing the Face of Beauty, has a daughter Grace, who was born with Down syndrome.

'Thank you for being the change that is long overdue,' she wrote to Miss Hammer. 'I could literally cry every time I read an article talking about your decision to include a model who just happens to have a disability! YOU are what this world needed!' 

Miss Driscoll also asked Miss Hammer to find a role model for Grace. 

Last September, Miss Hammer left a lasting impact on New York Fashion Week after she enlisted quadruple amputee Karen Crespo to model her spring 2015 designs.

But she never forgot about Grace - or her mother's request.

When Miss Hammer asked Miss Driscoll to suggest a model, she immediately chose Miss Brewer.

The actress, who is best known for playing Addie in American Horror Story: Murder House, Nan in American Horror Story: Coven and Marjorie in American Horror Story: Freak Show, is also an activist for intellectual disabilities.

Black magic: Miss Brewer played a clairvoyant witch named Nan in American Horror Story: Coven, in which she starred alongside Jessica Lange, Emma Roberts, Taissa Farmiga and Gabourey Sidibe 

At 19, she was elected to the State of Texas ARC Board, where she served for four years. She was also asked to join the Governmental Affairs Committee for the State of Texas where she was the only person with a disability.

During her two years of service, she worked with the committee and lawmakers to change the state’s wording to ‘intellectually disabled '. 

When creating an original design for the actress, Miss Hammer kept Miss Brewer's work on American Horror Story in mind.

'American Horror Story is dark, scary, bewitching so we had to go with black and Jamie has a beautiful body with a teeny waist and curves and we went with an A-line,' she explained. 

Miss Brewer, who was excited to make her runway debut, noted that Miss Hammer's design fits her personality.
