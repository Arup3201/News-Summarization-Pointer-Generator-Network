The estranged wife of celebrity chef Marco Pierre White appeared in court yesterday accused of vandalising his expensive Range Rover with a child's scooter.

Matilda 'Mati' Conejero, 47, is accused of damaging her husband’s car when it was parked outside his home in West London.

Conejero, who has three children with the restauranteur, is also said to have damaged a wall and the front door of Marco’s property at 8.30pm on May 7.

Criminal damage: Mati appeared at Isleworth Crown Court yesterday to deny allegations that she damaged estranged husband Marco Pierre White's Range Rover and property

Conejero, who was given bail, appeared at Isleworth Crown Court with her 10-year-old daughter Mirabelle.

She was only required to state her name in yesterday's proceedings, having previously pleaded not guilty to criminal damage.

In 2007 Spanish-born Conejero filed for divorce from 50-year-old Marco after she became convinced that the chef was cheating on her with two waitresses - with Marco strenuously denying the allegations.

But in 2011, amidst mounting legal costs the couple mutually withdrew the divorce filing.

Restaurateur Marco, who was the youngest ever chef to get three Michelin stars, was thought to be dating Silent Witness actress Emilia Fox after the pair were spotted dining out together and holding hands last month.

However, the 38-year-old actress is said to have broken up with the chef two weeks ago after the romance cooled between the pair.

A source recently spoke about Emilia and Marco to The Daily Mirror: 'They're still friends, but there isn't any romance anymore.'

The chef lives with his other two children from his relationship with Mati and one other child from a previous relationship.

Representatives for Marco have not yet responded to MailOnline’s request for comment.
