Now in its 25th year, the breathtaking Icehotel in Jukkasjärvi, Sweden, is gearing up for its latest massive re-build.

Opening again to guests in December, the hotel - located 200km north of the Arctic Circle and made entirely of snow and ice - is an architectural and engineering marvel.

Each year, hundreds of artists from around the world apply to design a room - called an art suite - at the Icehotel. The jury then selects a handful of artists to come to Sweden in November and December for their vision to take shape.

This year's artists have already been selected and room themes will range from a rainforest-inspired suite with orangutans to one art installation entitled 'Time Piece.' 

Each room is complete with a bed built by ice blocks, a thick mattress and reindeer skins, as well as a heavy-duty sleeping bag to keep the -7 degrees Celsius chill at bay. 

During the day, however, these 'cold rooms' must be vacated, since the hotel turns into an art installation for visitors. 

This season also marks the introduction of the Icehotel private function space - making icy cool weddings a stunning reality. The Aurora Hall will feature a private entrance, a stage for live performances, and inner walls made of solid ice, which will allow for unique acoustics and natural light conditions.

Certain signature fixtures will make their return this year, as well, including the popular Icebar BY Icehotel and a gourmet restaurant as well as the 61 rooms, a unicorn sculpture and a theatre.

Activities such as snowmobile tours, dog sledding, show-shoeing, and cross-country skiing are also available for guests.

The 2014/2015 season will last from December through to March, before the hotel melts away, beginning in April.

Nature takes its course: In the spring, the hotel will begin to melt - usually beginning in April - and water will return to the Torne River

Back to Mother Earth! Building the hotel takes eight weeks in total, but the melting process can take as long as three months
