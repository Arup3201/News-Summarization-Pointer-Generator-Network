Alberto Julian Meza, 25, has been arrested for dressing as a baby as a ploy to gain access to the homes of elderly women in Paraguay

A 25-year-old man conned his way into the homes of dozens of elderly women by dressing in nappies and sucking a lollipop as a ploy to steal from them.

Alberto Julian Meza pretended to be a lost toddler and asked for help to find his mother in the South American city of Paraguay.

Locals in the town of Villa Elisa, a suburb of Asuncion, said Meza was regularly seen walking around the streets and most people had assumed he was mentally ill.

However, Meza was using the disguise to get inside peoples' homes at which point he would steal whatever was at hand while they were making him a snack or getting him a drink.

Police have arrested Meza, but locals are surprised it took them so long.

Lara Orta Ornelas, 59, said: 'He has been doing this for years and I know the police have had complaints before, but it's incredible that they never realised the baby is actually a fully grown man. You can see him walking around the streets most days and a fully grown man in nappies is not exactly hard to find.'

Claudia Paiva, 43, told local TV: 'This man has been going around like this for a very long time and we are all amazed that they are only doing something right now about it.' 

A police spokesman defended the time it took police to make an arrest saying that the few complaints they had received all concerned the actions of a child, not a man dressed as one. 

The spokesman said, as a result they had not been looking for an adult man in a nappy. 

Meza was dressed in nappies and was carrying a lollipop and a bottle of milk when he was arrested

Police apprehended Meza after receiving a report that someone had been robbed by a man dressed as a baby with a lollipop. 

Meza was later found still dressed as a toddler. He was wearing nappies and was carrying a lollipop and a bottle of milk.   

The police spokesman said: 'When he saw the officers, he threw the wallet in a courtyard, but kept the money stuffed in his diaper where it was recovered and returned to the victim.'
