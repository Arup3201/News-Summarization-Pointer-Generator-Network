Bethenny Frankel has opened the doors to her gorgeous $5 million Manhattan apartment - the same home that the husband she is divorcing is refusing to leave. 

The TV star, 42, who has filed papers to divorce Jason Hoppy, 41, showed off her stunning 3,400-square-foot luxury apartment in the trendy Tribeca neighbourhood, in the pages of Traditional Home magazine.

In a sad touch, the pictures of the master bedroom feature bedside pictures of Bethenny and Jason in happier times before they announced their split in December.

The reality star turned Skinnygirl mogul told how she remodelled the property, which now features her own closet laden with designer heels - which was a former den - saying: 'I made this book 15 years ago of things I wanted but never could afford.'

She is in the midst of divorcing Jason, in what is shaping up to be a bitter battle - as TMZ reported that Jason has now filed for primary custody of their two-year-old daughter Bryn - and wants the apartment.

Bethenny - who sold her Skinnygirl Empire for $100 million 
in 2011 - bought the apartment in August 2011 and hired New York designers and mother-daughter duo Mariette Himes Gomez and Brooke Gomez, nicknaming them the Gomez Girls.

She said she was inspired by the interiors featured in films, adding: 'I loved the film Something’s Gotta Give, which reminds me of their style.

'They are very high-end. I think I may have taken them out of their comfort zone!'

Brooke Gomez said: 'The inspiration book was the bible. It is very helpful to have clients know what they like. Bethenny wanted calm and a ‘less is better’ approach. She knew what she wanted, and there was no hesitation. And that truly drove the process as a whole.”'

The cream-and-beige palette in the open living and dining space is accented with pops of orange-red—a favorite color for Bethenny and the signature color for Skinnygirl, as she said: 'Red is my lucky color and a power colour.'

The apartment features designer furniture and fabrics teamed with Bethenny's finds at Ikea and stories including CB2 and Restoration Hardware.

Bethenny said: 'I am a use-what-you-have type. I am all about not having a lot of stuff I don’t need.'

The pièce de résistance is the for den-turned-master-closet. A cloverleaf-backed chair and 
mirrored dressing table vie for attention with an enviable collection of
Manolos, Jimmy Choos, Valentinos, and Birkin bags.

Bethenny admitted: 'Every girl has her
vice', admitting it was her favourite room: 'I wanted a 
closet like this my whole life, and finally, I don’t have to shove 
things under the bed.'

The star runs her office from home and Skinnygirl posters abound, as well as books includingThe Power of Yes, health and
fitness volumes - and her own novel Skinnydipping.

Walls of off-white laminate with signature red accents house hidden storage at the touch of a fingertip.

With three work-stations and a makeup center, the office mirrors 
Bethenny’s work ethic. “Every single inch is utilized, and it’s very 
organized,” she notes. “It’s one of the most alive places in the 
apartment.”

Plus, there’s the whimsy of a Skinnygirl surfboard and 
oversize gifts from pals Anderson Cooper (microphone) and Andy Cohen 
(martini glass).

The apartment also features an all pink bedroom for little Bryn.

When asked how she managed her life, she said: 'I'm very 
organized and require everyone around me to be.

'My schedule is intense, and I am a multitasker. I do not 
procrastinate, and it’s all about checks and balances. I just do it!'

The strain of the past few months was etched on Bethenny's face as she walked Brynn home today, braving the freezing cold temperatures.

As MailOnline revealed, Bethenny is being helped through her split by billionaire pal Warren Lichtenstein.

Doting dad: Jason Hoppy looked after daughter Bryn while Bethenny Frankel was in LA this week. He's still living with his ex-wife and daughter

A friend said: 'she stayed at Warren's apartment one night earlier this month with her daughter Bryn as he was out of town, so  that she and Bryn 
could have some girl time.

'But she is not staying at Warren's home, nor did she 
move out of her home.'

Meanwhile,
businessman Jason continues to live at their luxury $5 million 
loft downtown with Bethenny, who is said to be keen that he finds 
somewhere else to stay after she filed for divorce.

A friend confirmed: 'Jason is still living at home with Bethenny and Bryn.'

Jason - who is still wearing his wedding band - was seen toting their two-year-old daughter around New York while Bethenny was away for work.

A
source stressed there was no romance between Bethenny and Warren, who 
runs hedge fund Steel Partners and is the Chairman and CEO of Steel 
Partners Holdings L.P.

The
couple spent Christmas together in Aspen with a group of friends, and 
Bethenny also accompanied Warren to Hong Kong in October.

Warren, 47, has a four-year-old daughter called Isabella with his former girlfriend, stunning blonde mountaineer Annabelle Bond. The couple broke off their romance five months into Annabelle's pregnancy, but are still amicable.

After Isabella's birth, Annabelle, who
was awarded an OBE for her mountaineering triumphs, told the Daily 
Mail: 'I am happy. He is happy. We're both thrilled about the baby, but 
we are no longer together. No one else is involved.'

Annabelle,
who is the daughter of  Sir John Bond,
the corporate genius who turned HSBC into a banking colossus and retired
from Vodafone in 2011, has conquered Everest and was the first woman to
complete the Seven Summits by climbing the highest peak on every 
continent in record time.

Meanwhile, Bethenny, who has filed 
divorce papers, is trying to get her life back on track and has 
reportedly hired Katie Holmes' divorce lawyer.

She
announced the separation from her husband of nearly three years over 
the holidays - after admitting how tough their marriage was - and said: 
'It brings me great sadness to say that Jason and I are separating.

'Support system: Warren Lichtenstein has been helping Bethenny Frankel. He has a daughter with stunning moutaineer Annabelle Bond, seen here

'This was an extremely difficult decision that as a woman and a mother, I have to accept as the best choice for our family.'

Last week, she tweeted: 'The ones in this world who succeed have the 
"figure it out" & "I'm on it" attitude & there are no problems, 
only solutions.'
