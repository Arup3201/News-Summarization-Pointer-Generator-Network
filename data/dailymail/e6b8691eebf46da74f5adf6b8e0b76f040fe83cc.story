This sprawling mansion with 19 bedrooms has become the latest 'mega mansion' to hit the London property market - for a staggering £45million.

Number 7 Balfour Place was built in 1891 as an Arts & Craft-style mansion but just over 20 years ago it was converted into six apartments.

But the building, in exclusive Mayfair, is now being sold and it is thought that potential billionaire buyers will want to convert it into a family home.

Prime location: 7 Balfour Place is located a short walk from Hyde Park and Grosvenor Square Garden

It is on the market for £45million and whoever ends up buying the 13,000 sq ft home could be making a shrewd purchase as property prices soar.

The building was designed by Eustace Balfour and has a five-storey brick façade, featuring large entertaining rooms and eight family bedrooms.

As six apartments, the building currently has 19 bedrooms, seven reception rooms, six kitchens, 17 bathrooms and a roof terrace.

Over the years it has had a number owners including several industrialists, a Dowager Countess and a City of London metal-trader magnate.

However the most famous person to covet the property never actually owned or lived in it.

On August 11, 1978, shipping heiress Christina Onassis flew into London on her private jet for a one-day tour of houses in Mayfair and Belgravia.

But she backed out of buying Number 7 because a neighbouring property was being rented by the DeGrimston family - whom gossips claimed were cult worshipers.

Their house was dubbed 'Satan's Cave' and it is thought this lead to the socialite getting cold feet on the purchase.

In 1991, the property was converted into six apartments and it is this internal configuration that is currently being offered for sale.

The flats range from 1,255 sqft up to 2,583 sqft in size, offering two to four bedrooms.

It has been put on the market with Wetherell Estates for £45million - making it one of the most expensive properties on the market in the UK.

Property prices are on the rise in Mayfair with homes changing hands for £4,000 and £5,000 per sq ft.

This could give 7 Balfour Place a potential value of between £52 and £65 million.

Some industry experts estimate values could hit £10,000 per sq ft in a decade - making it a £130million home.

Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: ‘Number 7 Balfour Place is one of the most magnificent Arts & Craft mansions in London.

'Built as a trophy property within the historic Grosvenor Estate it benefits from a prestigious Mayfair address, elegant architecture and rooms with princely proportions.

‘As apartments it could be used as an investment to generate rental income.

'Reinstated into a single residence, it could create one of London's finest mega-mansions, an outstanding home of world class quality and refined provenance.’
