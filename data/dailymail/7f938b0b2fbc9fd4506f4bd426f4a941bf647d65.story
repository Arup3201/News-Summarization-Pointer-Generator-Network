Owners of a stunning French-style chateau slashed £800,000 off its asking price in order to beat the new ‘mansion tax’.

The sprawling house, which boasts an indoor pool, jacuzzi, tennis courts and croquet lawn, has now been dropped to £1.9m - just below Chancellor George Osborne’s new levy on £2m-plus mansions.

A would-be buyer pulled out of purchasing the 11-bedroom house in the Welsh countryside due to the tax hike.

Price drop: Owners of the 11 bedroom mansion Plas Cilybebell near Swansea, South Wales, had to slash £800,000 off the asking price to avoid George Osborne's Mansion Tax

Palatial: Potential buyers pulled out of the sale at the 11th hour after realising the stunning property would be hit by George Osborne's new Mansion Tax

It was on the market for £2.7m to be sold as a plush retreat for professionals.

But
the Chancellor raised stamp duty for £2m-plus houses from five to 15 
per cent for company buyers - which would have added another £405,000.

The
luxury mansion called Plas Cilybebell is set two acres of gardens near 
Swansea, South Wales.

It was
bought for £1.4m two years ago by property and hotel chain Amazing 
Retreats who spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on a massive 
facelift.

The firm’s 
marketing manager Brooke White said: ‘Plas Cilybebyll was being bought 
by another company but it was put off by the 300 per cent rise in tax.

A quick dip: The house, which has an indoor pool among stunning features, is now on the market again for £800,000 less to entice bidders put off by the new tax levied on £2million-plus properties

In retreat: The 11 bedroom mansion Plas Cilybebell near Swansea, was on the market for £2.7m to be sold as a plush getaway for professionals until an offer fell through

‘The property was going to be purchased by a company for considerably more than £2m.

‘But following the budget and the substantial increase in stamp duty rates for properties purchased by companies they decided to withdraw.’

It is sold as a luxury country hideaway for professionals and company get-togethers.

National Association of Estate Agents former president Melfyn Williams said owners of properties around the more modest £250,000 mark have tried for years to keep their prices just below this level - so buyers pay less stamp duty.

He said: ‘A similar dynamic may now be entering the market for properties priced at around £2m.’
