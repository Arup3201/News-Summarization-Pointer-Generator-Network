Singles looking for a little affection on Valentine's Day can get some much-needed physical contact  at this year's first annual Cuddle Convention.

But don't get any bright ideas because the event is strictly non-sexual.

Cuddle Con will happen  on Saturday at several locations in Portland, Oregon and feature several workshops, classes and speakers.

But the highlight will be an afternoon 'snuggle party' expected to be attended by about 100.

Valentine's day plans: A Cuddle Convention will be held in Portland, Oregon this Valentine's Day. The event's organizer Samantha Hess pictured on the right in a previous broadcast about her cuddling business 

Samantha Hess is the woman behind the event and she says that everyone attending the party will need to go through a 30-minute consent class before entering the cuddle room. 

In the class, cuddlers will be briefed on what types of touch are appropriate and how to communicate with each other. Only those 18 and up will be allowed to participate and nudity is prohibited.

Ground rules: Hess says those who attend the convention's cuddle party must go through a 30-minute consent class where they will be briefed on appropriate touching 

'It has rules - it's touch that would be appropriate to do in front of children, basically,' Hess told the Oregonian. ' The space is big enough for about 100 people at a time.'

'Usually there's a lot of laughing, and sometimes we will get these things we call "puppy piles" with lots of people all just snuggling together. 

'There will probably also be some people just chatting in the corner, too. It's not all cuddling.' 

The idea for Cuddle Con came about two years ago, when Hess had just finished going through a trying divorce and saw a man advertising free hugs on Facebook. 

At the time she thought she would definitely pay someone money just for a hug. 

That led her to start her own business, Cuddle Me Up, where she provides platonic cuddles to clients.

The business has been so successful in Portland that she recently had to hire three more female workers. 

One of her clients is 47-year-old Kimberley Jenson who plans on attending this year's Cuddle Con. 

'I hated Valentine's Day, and now I am looking forward to it. I am hoping to cuddle non-stop,' Jensen told CNN. 

'Just because I don't have someone in my life doesn't mean I don't deserve affection and touch,' she added. 

Hess believes this year's Cuddle Con will show the many benefits of platonic cuddling, for both singles as couples.

In addition to the snuggle party, Cuddle Con will also feature partner yoga, acro yoga, a dance lift class, a blues dancing class, a breathing class, a posture class and a massage class. 

Tickets to the event start at $25.
