A massive brush fire threatened countless celebrity homes in the posh seaside California community of Pacific Palisades Tuesday before fast-acting firefighters were able to put out the blaze.

The Santa Anas, hot and dry winds that periodically parch much of California, helped fuel the blaze that scorched 10 acres and shut down the Pacific Coast Highway before it was contained with the aid of helicopters and SuperScooper aircraft.

The countless celebrities like Rihanna, Goldie Hawn and Jennifer Love Hewitt who call the area home can breathe a sigh of relief, but fire advisories will remain in effect into Wednesday.

SuperScooper aircraft dumped tons of water on streams of flame that rolled up a steep cliffside along Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades Tuesday afternoon.

The flames crept within feet of multimillion-dollar clifftop homes, but none were damaged and the fire was knocked down in about 1 1/2 hours, authorities said.

Earlier in Los Angeles, more than 100 firefighters and two helicopters responded when a large house caught fire in the Chatsworth area of the San Fernando Valley and strong gusts threatened to spit embers into a neighborhood downwind.

In the Santa Monica Mountains between Calabasas and Malibu, a blaze near a downed power line along Old Topanga Canyon Road was held to under two acres after a response that included more than 20 fire engines, eight hand crews, three Firehawk helicopters, two SuperScoopers and other units. Extra personnel had been positioned in the area because of the critical dryness.

'We were able to get kind of a quick jump on it,' said Inspector Scott Miller of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.

The Pacific Coast Highway was backed up for miles as crews struggled to put out the flames there.

According to KTLA, the fire was declared contained by 5pm.

No injuries or evacuations were reported and authorities say the exact cause of the blaze remained under investigation Tuesday evening.
