There's a first time for everything, isn't there? First time in a new country. First time you go on a holiday that leaves you speechless. 

And the first time you take one of those 'selfies' that everyone is talking about.

The country was Burma, which has  just started opening up to touris, and since the best way to see the sights is by taking a river cruise, I booked up for a few nights onboard.

'A floating paradise': A river cruise on the Sanctuary Ananda was the best way to see the sights

The brochure promised enchantment and luxury, along with the chance to experience this fascinating land close up.

I have to say, they were true to their promise. The boat, Sanctuary Ananda, is basically a floating paradise. 

The first thing I did when I got to my cabin was throw open the French doors and step on to the veranda. The second thing was to clamber on to the fluffy nest of a bed and enjoy the sight of a new world sliding past my windows.

At this point, I promised myself that one day I would lie there and watch the sunrise. Next morning, thanks to jet lag, that's exactly what I did. It was so superb, I set my alarm so I could enjoy it every day.

Ox-cart ride anyone? Stan enjoyed his bumpy ride in the back of the taxi

Our guide later explained that the owners of Sanctuary Ananda, obviously aware of the negative impact tourism can sometimes have on real lives like these, are working with the village elders to plan for the future. 

The first fruits of this philanthropic project are a full-time teacher and a library in the village.

The next few days passed in a blur of excitement. We stopped off to explore ancient ruins and temples that were still very much in use. One day I found myself wandering along a dusty path, wilting in the heat.

I hailed a passing ox cart, which had the word 'taxi' scrawled on the side, and got a delightfully bumpy lift back to the shore.

Next morning I was up before the sun had even thought about rising. I couldn't sleep, and couldn't face breakfast. 

Truth be told, I could hardly stop myself from doing a dance. The reason was simple. I live in Bristol, which is pretty much home of the hot air balloon. 

I've always wanted to go up in one of these outsized cuddly toys, but for one reason or another I've never got round to it. 

Until now. So there I was, on a gorgeous boat in a land of loveliness, crossing my fingers for good ballooning weather.

Luckily, the wind stayed away and the captain announced that conditions were perfect. A few of us scampered up the bank and climbed into a vintage coach that would carry us to the take-off field.

The balloon sighed into the sky just in time for the sun to rise over the 2,000 temples of Bagan.

As balloon rides go, it was magical. The early morning sunlight shone through the mist, picking out temples and pagodas with golden sparks.

That was when I decided it was time for my first selfie. I'm not saying it was the best picture I've ever taken, but it is definitely one click I am never going to forget.

On our last evening we were treated to a candlelit feast under the night sky. As I sat there thinking nothing could improve my world, a flurry of shooting stars whooshed overhead. Moments later, a harvest moon peeped over the horizon, lighting up the river.

I actually had to pinch myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming. Our host, Daniel, saw my dazed look and asked if I could think of any way, no matter how big or small, in which the company could improve my holiday experience.

I'll be honest, I tried. I really did. I gave it my full attention. I desperately tried to think of something I would have changed. But I couldn't think of a thing. Not a single, solitary one. 

I had to turn to Daniel and admit the truth. It had been the perfect holiday.
