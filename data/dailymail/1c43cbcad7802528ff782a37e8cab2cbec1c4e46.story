From Botox and lasers to surgery and 
high-end face creams, the beauty market is saturated with products and devices that promise to help delay the signs of ageing.

And the latest addition to the litany of products is a vibrating wand, likened by its makers to a Power Plate for the face.

Lift Away The Years is a £59.99 hand-held vibrating device that claims to give an instant firming and lifting 
effect to the whole face including eyes, brows, jawline and cheeks, as well as
plumping lines and wrinkles.

Latest anti-ageing tool: Lift Away The Years is a £59.99 hand-held vibrating device that claims to give an instant firming and lifting effect to the whole face

The battery-powered device, which is recommended to be used twice daily on the face and neck, combines vibration and skincare in a two-part system that claims to maximise 
wrinkle-fighting, moisturising and firming performance.

Crystal Clear, the company who make the product, explain that facial muscles are subject to 
deterioration and sagging, just as the muscles in the body are, and 
require much the same toning and exercise.

Before and after: Fine lines and wrinkles appear to be reduced by up to 27 per cent and testers noticed a 45 per cent increase in skin firmness

The wand is designed to provide these delicate muscles with the equivalent of a 
personal trainer for your face.

Vibration causes the muscles to 
contract, stimulating blood flow and increasing oxygenation of the skin 
to restore the shape and contour of the face.

The device also releases  an anti-ageing serum packed with scientifically proven 
peptides, including Syn-Ake.

Based on a polypeptide 
found in the venom of the Temple Viper snake, it is particularly 
effective in reducing expression lines and wrinkles by inhibiting muscle
contractions.

Good vibrations: Vibration causes the muscles to contract, stimulating blood flow and increasing oxygenation of the skin (photo shows lift to left hand side brow area and improvement in colour under the eye after using for one minute)

Syn-Ake is said to be loved by Cheryl Cole, Tulisa and Kate Moss.

The product was developed by Sharon Hilditch, MBE, MD of Crystal Clear and was tested on 30 volunteers over eight weeks.

They found that home use reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by 27 per cent and noticed a 45 per cent increase in skin firmness too.

Sharon Hilditch, said: 'Consumers want to see results based on evidence backed skincare formulations and far less hype in a jar.

'Lift Away the Years has been two years in development and is fully supported by scientific results.'

Fans: The device releases Syn-Ake serum, which is said to be loved by Cheryl Cole, Tulisa and Kate Moss
