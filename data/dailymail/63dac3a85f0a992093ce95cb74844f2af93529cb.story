Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal both comfortably sealed a spot in the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells with straight-set victories on Wednesday.

Federer beat American 22-year-old Jack Sock 6-3, 6-2 to set up a last-eight clash with Czech Tomas Berdych.

After a tight first set against Sock, Federer ran away with the match in the end as he notched up his 50th win in Indian Wells.

Nadal also reached the last eight, beating Gilles Simon 6-2, 6-4 to stay on track for a shot at his fourth career title in the desert.

The Spaniard next plays sixth-seeded Milos Raonic, who defeated 17th-seeded compatriot Tommy Robredo 6-3, 6-2 in a fourth-round match.

Nadal served a love game to close out his match that began as a dust storm swirled outside the stadium under overcast skies. He connected on 70 percent of his first serves in beating Simon for the seventh time in eight meetings.
