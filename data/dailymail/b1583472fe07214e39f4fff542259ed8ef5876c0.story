A woman has donated a kidney to a complete stranger in order to save her sister's life as part of a organ donation exchange.

Roseann Mcgee stepped in to help her sibling, offering to donate her organ to a stranger 'swapping' it to ensure her sister received a healthy organ.

When the 45-year-old from Peebles in Scotland discovered her sister Lisa, 42, was suffering kidney failure, she immediately offered to be a living donor.

But tests revealed she was not a perfect match for her sibling.

Determined to help, Roseann agreed to take part in a kidney exchange, donating one of her organs to a complete stranger in return for a healthy kidney for her sister.

When doctors found a healthy donor organ for Lisa Mcgee, the exchange programme dictated she could only recieve the organ if Roseann would donate hers to someone else.

Roseann said: 'The whole experience was really rewarding, I would do anything for my sister - I just wish I could’ve saved her myself but unfortunately my kidney wasn’t a match.

'I was already willing to give up my kidney to save a life so it made perfect sense to still donate it even if it wasn’t to save my own sister - instead I’ve saved the life of someone else’s sister, mother or daughter.

'As soon as Lisa’s donor was being operated on I was given the thumbs up and doctors began operating on me - like a huge domino effect.'

While Roseann shares the same blood group as her sister, the siblings' tissue is not compatible, meaning Lisa's body would reject the kidney.

To take part in the kidney exchange the sisters submitted both their details to a central bank system, collating information on donors from across the UK.

The search found two possible matches to allow Lisa to receive her kidney.

After suffering severe headaches in 2009, tests revealed Lisa, pictured in hospital having dialysis, was suffering kidney failure. Doctors revealed her organs had shut down after being destroyed by the tonsillitis virus, which she had suffered 20 years previously

Lisa, 42, pictured in hospital after her operation, said: 'I finally have some energy and I owe it all to my generous donor and of course my courageous big sister'

Paired or pooled donation is when a living kidney donor and recipient are incompatible with each other.

While they do not match, it is possible for them to be matched with another donor and recipient in the same situation.

The donor kidneys can then be 'exchanged' or 'swapped'.

The recipient receives a kidney from a stranger and the donor gives their healthy organ to another stranger.

When two pairs are involved in the donation chain it is known as a paired donation.

When more than two pairs take part it is a pooled donation.

Any donor and recipient pair who are considering a living kidney donation, is eligible for the scheme.

Ms Mcgee said: 'Last summer I got a call from the hospital saying there was a possible match.

'The
 altruistic donor said they would donate their kidney if I was still 
willing to be a live donor - of course I was - anything to save my baby 
sister.

'The donor 
stipulated that the process was to be done through paired exchange in 
order to create a domino effect so several people would be able to 
benefit.

'After all my 
kidney tests came back okay me and Lisa saw a consultant doctor to make 
sure I was not being forced into this operation, not getting any 
financial gain and to make sure I was in sound mind to go through this 
process.

'We were both in the same hospital and when Lisa’s donor had started the procedure it was all go for me too.

'The pain was much higher than I anticipated but it was all worth it to save my beautiful sisters life.'

Lisa first fell ill in January 2009, complaining of severe headaches.

Her sister said: 'My family have always been really close and my sister is more like my best friend - we’ve always shared everything.

As soon as she discovered her sister was severely ill and needed a transplant, Roseann, left, offered to donate her kidney to Lisa. But tests revealed the siblings were not the perfect match, meaning Lisa's body would reject Roseann's kidney

The sisters, pictured with their brother as children, signed up to the kidney exchange. The process required Roseann to donate her kidney to a stranger to enable Lisa to receive an organ from another stranger

'Lisa started telling me about these 
violent headaches she’d been having but typical Lisa brushed it off and 
said they were from playing her new iPod too loud.

'I advised her to get it checked out being the worried big sister and eventually she went to see the doctor.

'He
 checked her blood pressure mainly but again twice after by a machine as
 he could tell something wasn’t right - her BP was off the scale - it 
was so high that it wasn’t giving a reading.'

The doctor phoned for an ambulance straight away and the family rushed to be by Lisa’s side.

Medics later revealed Lisa could have died at any point due to her high blood pressure.

Tests eventually revealed she was in renal failure, her kidneys shutting down.

'I remember feeling completely overwhelmed and I was absolutely heart broken when I found out,' said Roseann.

'She was made to change everything about her life, she had to give up work and she was given up to 20 different drugs a day.

'It was gut-wrenching to see her in so much pain and looking more and more ill when there was nothing I could do about it.

'Just in time for Christmas Lisa’s was struggling to function on her own so it was time for a dialysis.

'Three months later she was put onto the transplant list and me, my brother and our parents were all tested hoping we would be suitable donors.

'My parents were both not suitable after both previously being treated for cancer.

'Our brother was her best chance but he had a successful career in the army and could be called for active service at any time.

'I prayed to be a match but due to her unusual high level of antibodies they would just fight mine - just usual sisterly stuff.'

Lisa
 and Roseann were then introduced to the idea of the kidney exchange, 
raising Lisa's chances of receiving a healthy new organ.

Matches were found and Roseann was able to donate one of her kidneys to a stranger, so another stranger could save her sister.

Following their transplant operations, Lisa was in hospital for six weeks, battling to stop her body rejecting her new organ.

Lisa said: 'I was finally allowed home at Christmas and I have such a new lease for life - I finally have some energy and I owe it all to my generous donor and of course my big courageous sister.

'I’m now fully on the mend and have recently done some fundraising of my own to give something back and I have now raised an incredible £4,000 after shaving my hair off for Kidney Research UK.

'Eventually doctors discovered the cause of my kidney failure - when she I was younger I had tonsillitis and the infection had stayed in my body which eventually destroyed my kidneys over a 20-year period.

'Both me and Roseann are now encouraging everyone to consider the kidney exchange program and becoming a live donor as it can save someone’s life.

'It’s not something you really think about until you find yourself in the position our family was faced with - it’s the most precious gift you can give.'
