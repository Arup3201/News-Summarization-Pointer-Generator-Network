A Little League coach known for his consummate dedication to mentoring children has been killed in Georgia.

Brandon Weaver, 37, was called by his young son to be picked from a birthday party about an hour north of Atlanta on Nov. 22.

The boy asked him to get him because the adults there began to act 'drunk' and 'rowdy,' WSB-TV reported.

Police say Weaver got into an altercation with Herman Seppenfield VII (right) at a birthday party. Seppenfield allegedly shot the coach twice, killing him

Weaver returned to the party a few hours later and  a fight broke out.

During the altercation, 50-year-old Herman Seppenfield VII allegedly fired two shots and struck Weaver.

Capt. Tony Wooten told WSB-TV that Weaver died shortly after police arrived.

'He had been shot twice, one in the chest and one in the side,' he added.

It remains unclear why Weaver returned to the party or what caused the fight. 

Seppenfield was arrested on Thursday in connection with the incident and remains held without bond.

For more than eight years, Weaver had been a popular volunteer coach with Dawson Parks and Recreation, where he led baseball, basketball, football and T-ball.

'He was just one of those people that everybody was attracted to and the kids really latched onto him,' department head Lisa Henson told WSB-TV.

Sherry Moon, whose child was coached by Weaver, said he was an 'absolute inspiration' to kids around him. 

Her husband created a wooden memorial in his memory, which now hangs behind home plate at the Rock Creek Park field.

'None of us know what happened that night and we may never,' Moon told WSB-TV.

'But I know he was sticking up for children and that is the bottom line, the same thing he always did.'
