In a white, immaculate interior, there stands a white, immaculate yacht.

But this is no ordinary yacht - it is one of the most luxurious ones that money can buy... and this is the almost heavenly place where they are built.

The workshop is owned by Monaco-based company Wally Yachts, which specialises in unique, high-performance boats.

Their clients range from your average captain of industry to multimillionaires with a James Bond fixation - which is just as well as the vessels can cost as much as £20million.

A rare glimpse inside the warehouse where super yachts are built: This is Wally Ace, a motorised vessel - no doubt destined for a multimillionaire

The workshop is owned by Monaco-based company Wally Yachts, which specialises in unique, high-performance boats. The Wally Ace, above, is 86ft long

At 164ft in length, Wally Sail, Better Place, is the biggest carbon fibre sloop so far built by the company

These images, photographed by Benedict Redgrove, show three different vessels: Wally Ace,
a motorised yacht; Wally One, a single-deck, with 630 horsepower; and Wally Sail, Better Place, which at 164ft is the biggest carbon fibre sloop 
so far built by the company.

And to give an idea of its owner's wealth, the latter was in the process of being painted the same color as 
their Bugatti.

Mr Regdrove, who specialises in shooting jets, cars and boats during their production, said: 'These were shot as part of a slight rebrand that I think came to a halt, which was a real shame as we never got round to shooting the final images of the yachts when they had been launched.

'I would love my own boat and can't see myself not owning one at some point, but maybe not as grand as Better Place.

Wally One (above) is 43ft long, and comes in a choice of colours including blue, black, white, red and green

Mr Redgrove said 'The yachts ride so well and so smoothly.' Above, Wally One

'I've heard it costs approximately 10 per cent of the build costs to run a boat each year - and the saying goes "The two best days of owning a yacht are the day you buy it and the day you sell it".'

Wally One is believed to cost around £300,000; Wally Ace, £3.5million; and Better Place, £20million.

The photoshoot took place in three locations which have dedicated Wally boatyards: Forli (for Wally Sail, Better Place) and Ancona (Wally Ace), both in Italy; and Monaco (Wally One).

'The shoot at Forli was unbelievably uncomfortable,' the photographer added.

'It was a ridiculously hot day and we spent most of it under a tarpaulin or inside a boat with no moving air and lots of wood dust and sweat dripping off us.

'The yachts ride so well and so smoothly. We had great captains.

'On the second day. we saw Eclipse, [Russian business tycoon] Roman Abramovich's mega-yacht. I can see why they called it Eclipse - it dwarfed everything.

As to the cost of running them... these behemoths can easily glug 15 gallons of fuel per nautical mile.

But if you can afford to buy one of them, surely that added financial burden is just a drop in the ocean.
