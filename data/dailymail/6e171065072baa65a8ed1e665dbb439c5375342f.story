An American college student may have cheesed off our neighbors by winning a Canadian eating competition featuring the Quebecois delicacy poutine.

Matt 'Megatoad' Stonie, from San Jose, California, chomped his way to the title by eating close to 15lb of the greasy snack - made up of french fries, cheese curds and gravy - in  ten minutes. The weight amounted to 29 boxes. 

Stonie, 22, won the professional eating competition during the fifth annual World Poutine Eating Championship in Toronto, Canada on Saturday.

The competition was run by Smoke’s Poutinerie and offered all those who gathered free boxes of the snack during the largest eating competition in Canada.

All proceeds from the event, which also featured a KISS cover band, went to Canadian homeless charity, Covenant House. 

Following his big win, Stonie tweeted: 'I just won the biggest trophy ever. Ever.' 

The college student reports on his Facebook page that he is the world number two in competitive eating.

Following his poutine record on Saturday, Stonie went on to gain a World Record on Sunday by eating 20Lbs 13oz (83.2 Slices) of pumpkin pie. 

On Tuesday, Stonie takes on the Horseshoe Casino's Pierogi Eating Championship in Chicago. 

Poutine was created in the province of Quebec some time in the late 1950s - with numerous towns claiming to have created the very first dish. 

The recipe typically requires fries of a medium cut with a crispy coating topped with bite-sized cheese curds and drenched in a light gravy, usually chicken or turkey. 

There are numerous variations - in Montreal they offer the dish with chicken, bacon or the city's special smoked meat. In Shawinigan and the surrounding area of Quebec, shredded cabbage replaces the cheese curds.
