Former AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd has revealed that the criminal charges against him have done little to destroy his rock and roll spirit, as he declares that he wants his job back - and his reputation.

Despite the 60-year-old currently being before the New Zealand courts on charges of threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis, Rudd told ONE News that he planned to enjoy his time by 'fishing, flying and fornicating'.

'I'm going fishing, flying this afternoon and lots of fornicating tonight,' Rudd, who has denied the charges against him, said when asked about his plan for the day.

Former AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd has said he wants both his reputation and his drumming job back

Rudd played on recording sessions for the Australian rockers' latest album, Rock Or Bust, but he hasn't been able to promote the album while he deals with the charges.

But the musician says he wants to rejoin the band.

'I'm going back to work with AC/DC and I don't care who likes it or who doesn't,' he told One News.

'I want my job back and I want my reputation back.'

In a summary of facts released to media earlier this month, the Crown says Rudd made a phone call to a man he knew, whose name is suppressed, on September 26, threatening to kill both him and his daughter.

This was consistent with another phone call made by Rudd earlier that morning, the summary of facts said.

It says Rudd denied threatening to kill anybody and denied making any of the phone calls he was alleged to have made when he was interviewed by police. 

The drug charges were laid after police executed a search warrant at Rudd's home on November 6. Police say Rudd had 0.71g of methamphetamine and 130g of cannabis in his possession.

Rudd was also charged with attempting to procure a murder when he appeared in court in November, but it was dropped by the crown solicitor the following day.

Rudd's lawyer indicated after the charge was dropped that it had done incalculable damage to his reputation and he was considering what remedies he might have.

The threatening to kill case is due back in Tauranga District Court on February 10, when a date for a judge-alone trial is likely to be set.
