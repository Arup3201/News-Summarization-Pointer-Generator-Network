She may only be 16 months old but with a style icon for a mother and a fashion designer for a father, it was clear that North West was going to be one fashionable tot.

After showcasing her fashion credentials at Paris fashion week, Kim and Kanye's daughter cemented her status as a global style icon.

In fact her A-list parents are taking Nori's new status so seriously that they've reportedly hired a personal tailor to ensure that Kim and her daughter always coordinate.

Mini me! North West may not be happy about it, judging by this picture, but Kim Kardashian has called in a personal tailor to ensure she and her 16-month-old daughter always coordinate

A source told Grazia magazine: 'Kim has hired North her own personal tailor whose sole job is to make mini versions of Kim's designer outfits and ensure that they always coordinate.

'The tailor, who is also paid to act as North's stylist, works with Kanye and Kim's styling team to create the toddler's looks. Some are collaborations or commissions to designers themselves, and others created in-house.

Matching on the frow: North and Kim were coordinated at the Givenchy show, which was apparently planned well in advance by the star's team of stylists

'Her wardrobe is planned well in advance with regular meetings to discuss looks for the family's public appearances, and North has versions to match a lot of what Kim wears, from dresses to handbags and shoes.'

The mother daughter duo were the talk of the town in Paris as they hit the fashionable front rows in matching outfits.

They wore coordinated outfits at the Givenchy SS15 PFW show, and even stepped out wearing matching white styles for lunch upon their return to LA. 

The small fashion icon has even already made her modelling debut, and of course she wore Chanel for her first foray. 

Next to the photo was a quote from the brand's creative director Karl Lagerfeld, which says: 'It is never too early to care about fashion.'
