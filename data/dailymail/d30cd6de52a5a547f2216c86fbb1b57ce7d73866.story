For more than 40 years it has gently chugged along giving joy rides to generations of delighted children.

But last week the model railway at Barshaw Park in Paisley, Scotland, was brought to an abrupt standstill at the insistence of health and safety bosses.

Excited youngsters who had flocked for the park's annual Gala Day were ordered off the miniature train moments before it was about to depart because council bureaucrats say the genteel attraction does not have the necessary certification.

All change: The miniature railway has been popular with young children and families for generations but now requires a health and safety certificate

Despite Paisley Model Engineering Society having safely operated the railway without incident since the 1970s, Renfrewshire Council now says the tracks must be subject to an 'independent inspection'.

Society member Alan Wallace accused the council of being heavy-handed and said the safety certificate they had been asked to produce was the kind expected of 'high-speed, money-making fairground rides'.

He said: 'We have been running the railway for over 40 years without incident but now the council needs to see a certificate stating that it is safe.

'It would appear that council 
officials are requiring the same level of certification as that required
for high-speed, money-making fairground rides.'

He
added: 'We would like to apologise to kids, of all ages, who hoped to 
have a ride on the miniature railway as part of their gala day outing.

'We especially want to apologise to the passengers who were ordered off the train just before its departure.'

Local councillor Brian Lawson pointed out that the Model Engineering 
Society is covered by public liability insurance and maintains the 
railway equipment to meet with Health and Safety Executive (HSE) 
guidelines.

He said: 
'While I appreciate the need to ensure public safety, I have to ask why 
this was not sorted out long before the gala day.

'I hope everyone concerned can put their heads together and get the Barshaw train back on the rails as soon as possible.

'It would be a terrible loss to generations of Paisley people if they were to lose the train.'

Local authority chiefs defended the decision to put
the brakes on the gala day railway fun.

A
spokesman said: 'An accident at Barshaw Park could have very serious 
consequences, particularly if a lot of children were riding on a train 
at the time.

'There are 
raised sections of track which need proper maintenance to make sure they
can take the weight of the train and passengers.

'On May 21, we asked the model railway society to have a safety check carried out by a suitable independent inspector.

'The council gave the society plenty 
of notice but we made it clear they would not be allowed to run rides 
for the public on Barshaw Gala Day if it didnâ€™t have a safety 
certificate.

'We offered to meet members of the 
society on the day of the gala but no one turned up, so we had no option
but to prevent the train rides from taking place.

'Some
members of the public were asked to get off the train and they were 
happy to do so when the situation was explained to them.

'The council will now arrange to have the inspection done.'

In 2011, the new boss of the Health and Safety Executive Judith Hackitt said she wanted to put an an end to misguided 'jobsworths' who wrongly use legislation to ban sensible activities.

Ms Hackitt said health and safety had become 'shorthand for someone, somewhere, 
stopping someone from doing something they want to'.

Here are ten more examples of council 'elf and safety decisions gone mad:
