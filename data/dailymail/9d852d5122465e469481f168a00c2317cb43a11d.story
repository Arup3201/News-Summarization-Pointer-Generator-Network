Key evidence from the day that O.J. Simpson's wife was murdered may have been stolen from Khloe Kardashian's mansion during her recent burglary.

The evidence in question is a set of golf clubs and golf bag that once belonged to O.J. Simpson and were last known to be in the possession of Khloe's father, Robert Kardashian.

Mr Kardashian was Simpson's friend and member of his legal defense team during his murder trial in 1995.

Khloe's mansion in Tarzana, California, which she shared with her estranged husband Lamar Odom was burgled earlier this month - she was robbed of at least $250,000 worth of jewellery.

But O.J. Simpson's manager Norman Pardo, told RadarOnline he believes people close to Simpson, as well as other individuals, were looking for the set of golf clubs that once belonged to the American football player as key evidence linked to the murder case.

RadarOnline reports that Kris Jenner 
described the golf clubs in her book in 2011, writing about an encounter
 with Mr Kardashian and Simpson days before the murder of Nicole 
Brown Simpson.

She claims Mr Kardashian told her: 'O.J. was really upset because we had to go to the airport to get his clubs.'

Jenner
 asked why, when he was grieving, he would do this, when the airport 
could mail them, to which Mr Kardashian replied in reference to 
Simpson's whereabouts during the murder of his wife: 'Well, Kris, he was
 at a golf tournament.

O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, are shown in this October 19, 1993. Nicole Brown Simpson was slashed to death along with a friend, Ronald Goldman, outside her condominium in Los Angeles

'When the police came and took him to the airport and he got on the plane, his clubs didn’t make it. They just arrived today.'

Jenner claimed that she thought this sounded 'suspicious' in line with many others, who RadarOnline claim believe that that Simpson had hidden the murder weapon, a knife, among the metal clubs so it wouldn’t set off security alarms.

Pardo told RadarOnline: 'It’s not the knife or anything like that, but there’s a lot of stuff in the golf clubs that’s not supposed to be in there.

'It wasn’t bloody gloves or bloody clothes. There were other things.

The mansion that Lamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian shared was broken in to earlier this month

'Rumor has it that the golf clubs were hollowed out and there was 
something inside them.

'I’ve been told by people very close to O.J. that 
what’s in that bag is worth more than most people’s homes.

'Nobody knows 
where the golf clubs went after Robert Kardashian died.

'Are they still buried at his house? I recently put the word out that 
I’m looking for them and people have been tearing everything apart 
looking for them.'

Following Khloe Kardashian's mansion break in, Pardo claims to have been suspicious, saying: 'I thought, people looking for the clubs went into her house.

'Khloe was 
the daughter — possibly — of both Robert and O.J. Is she hiding those 
golf clubs? Is that what those people were looking for?

'Khloe may not even know. She may have been too young. A lot of people 
don’t know those golf clubs mean anything other than Kris.'

Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman were murdered on June 12, 1994 outside Brown's condominium.

Simpson was charged with their deaths, but subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial.

In
 the unanimous jury findings of a civil court case in February 1997, 
Simpson was found liable for the wrongful death of Ronald Goldman and 
stabbing of Nicole Brown.

A police investigation is currently open.
