Arsenal are ready to make another move for Chris Smalling in the January transfer window following the defensive injury crisis that has engulfed them since losing Mathieu Debuchy last weekend.

Despite Smalling’s failure to live up to expectations at Manchester United, Arsene Wenger still rates the central defender, having been on the point of signing him from Fulham in January 2010, before a last-minute intervention by Sir Alex Ferguson saw the defender opt for United.

Last month Wenger had insisted on Smalling being part of any swap deal that took place with Manchester United for Thomas Vermaelen – but United refused to include him and Vermaelen ended up at Barcelona.

Smalling has struggled to live up to expectations himself at United, though new manager Louis van Gaal has started with him in games and the centre half is currently on his way back from a groin injury and available to play against Leicester today (Sun). But van Gaal has also indicated that he wants to add to his defensive positions in January and if that means Smalling is left out, Arsenal will make their move.

Wenger inquired about the availability of Smalling and Phil Jones, another player Arsenal tried to sign in 2010, when United and Arsenal were in talks about a potential Vermaelen move last month but was told neither was available.

United might be sensitive to a deal perceived to be helping Arsenal’s situation, given the criticism the club received for letting Danny Welbeck joining Arsenal for £16m on transfer deadline day and the fact the two clubs are likely to be battling for Champions League places.

Only last weekend Wenger was insisting that three centre halves could be enough to see Arsenal through the season, but with Debuchy now out, possibly for three months if he needs surgery, the club look incredibly frail at the back.

Calum Chambers can fill in at right back but is also the club’s first choice back-up in central defence and is only 19 years old. Hector Bellerin played at right back against Borussia Dortmund but struggled in a poor Arsenal performance.

Arsenal are already looking at possible free agents they could sign to bolster their defence in the short term but ultimately it looks as if they will need to make the move to sign another established defender.
