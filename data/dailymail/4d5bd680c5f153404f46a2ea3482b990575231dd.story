David Cameron finally said ‘sorry’ for the passport shambles last night as emergency measures were brought in to tackle the backlog.

After days of denials, the Government finally admitted that urgent action was needed to deal with the crisis.

In the face of mounting public anger, Mr Cameron caved in and apologised. ‘If people’s passports have been delayed and people have been inconvenienced, of course the Government is sorry for that,’ a Downing Street spokesman said.

Backlog: A pile of passport application wait to be processed at the passport centre in Liverpool

Those who desperately need travel documents to go on foreign trips will now have their applications fast-tracked free of charge, instead of paying an extra £55.50 a person. Those renewing their UK passports from overseas will be given an automatic 12-month extension.

And families applying from abroad for passports on behalf of their children will be given emergency travel documents, as long as they provide ‘comprehensive proof’ they are the parents. Ministers stressed security would not be compromised by the changes.

But in farcical scenes, the beleaguered Home Office could not say last night whether ‘urgent need’ included anyone with a holiday booked or, indeed, even how the new steps would work.

Under-fire Home Secretary Theresa May effectively admitted the Passport Office was in chaos after being hauled to the Commons to explain the 500,000 backlog of  applications

Nor could officials say how it would 
affect someone whose application was already lying in a file with 
hundreds of thousands of  others at a UK passport centre.

 Home Secretary Theresa May effectively admitted the Passport Office was
 in chaos after being hauled to the Commons to explain the 500,000 
backlog of  applications. She unveiled the new measures after days of 
negative headlines as ministers scrambled to tackle the delays.

The
 Mail has told how devastated families have been forced to cancel summer
 holidays, or leave loved ones at home, because their passports had not 
been issued by the departure date.

The Passport Office has ordered an extraordinary internal inquiry after a photograph, above, emerged of hundreds of files full of applications stacked in a meeting room.

A whistleblower took the picture at the passport centre in Liverpool. In a letter to staff, Passport Office security liaison officer Andy Bannon wrote: ‘This is being viewed as a serious security breach.’

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘Instead of wasting resources chasing a genuine whistleblower, the Passport Office should spend their time and money getting people their passports.’

People were still queuing for up to four hours at passport offices in Peterborough and Durham as the Government finally took action.

Hundreds of people headed to the passport
 offices to make sure they got their travel documents in time for their 
holidays – with up to 98,000 having been hit by delays.

In the Commons, Mrs May said the Passport Office would increase the number of examiners and call handlers by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12-year high.

She said the measures would help, but warned there was no quick ‘big bang, single solution’.

Mrs May added: ‘I understand their anxiety and the Government will do everything it can while maintaining the security of the passport to make sure that people get their passports in time.’ In a clear sign of ministerial frustration at the mounting political damage to the Government, the Home Secretary said she was considering stripping the Passport Office of its agency status and bringing it under direct Home Office control.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘This has been a sorry shambles from a sorry department and a Home Secretary who can’t even bring herself to say the word.

‘Government incompetence means people are at risk of missing their holidays, their honeymoons, their business trips. Every MP has been inundated with these cases and the Home Secretary hasn’t seemed to even know what is going on.’ Ministers say the Passport Office has dealt with 3.3million applications so far this year – an ‘unprecedented’ surge of 300,000 on the same period in 2013.

However, Home Office accounts show that as early as December 2012, ministers were expecting 350,000 additional applications when it transferred responsibility for dealing with passports overseas from embassies and consulates.

Some 97 per cent of standard applications are issued within the three-week target, although this leaves 3 per cent – or about 98,000 people – facing delays.

SAYING GOODBYE

Jayne Bunting, 50, fears she will miss her father’s cremation after he died suddenly in France while her passport was being renewed.

She sent off her application just under three weeks ago, but has no idea when it will be renewed.The mature student from Worthing is willing to pay the extra £55.50 to have it fast-tracked, but has been unable to speak to anyone to hand over the payment.

Miss Bunting said: ‘I’m absolutely devastated. I can understand people being upset about losing their holiday, but they can book another one. I won’t ever have the opportunity to say goodbye to my dad again. It’s awful. I’m disgusted by their lack of care.’

HOLIDAY RUINED

Amy Vernon, 30, missed out on a dream holiday with her family following weeks of problems with the Passport Office.

She and her husband James, 27, were planning to take their three children to a resort in Ibiza. The couple, both teachers, applied for all five passports on March 29 – five weeks before their flight.

The family missed their flights, but sent fresh applications which they were told would be fast-tracked, so they booked new flights for May 6, costing nearly £500. But further delays at the Durham passport office  on the day meant they arrived at the airport 15 minutes late.

Mrs Vernon said: ‘I cannot understand why it has taken so long.

‘We’re all heartbroken.’ A YEAR’S WAIT?

Caroline Dodson, 29, an expat living in Turkey, has been told it may take up to a year to get a passport for her new baby.

The doctor, who lives in Istanbul with her accountant husband James, 35, sent off her application on April 12, soon after son Wilfred was born. If they do not receive the document within 90 days, they will not be able to apply for a residents’ permit, which could mean a large fine when they eventually leave Turkey.

Mrs Dodson said: ‘We are very disappointed.’

SISTERS STRANDED 

Isla and Iona Meldrum look set to miss out on seeing their relatives after being grounded in the United Arab Emirates by passport delays.

The sisters, aged ten and 12, live in Dubai with their parents. But almost two months after their mother Fiona, 49, sent Isla’s passport off for renewal, it still has not been returned. Mrs Meldrum said: ‘They say it’s because they need to implement security checks. I don’t see why they need to do security checks on a ten-year-old.’

200-MILE CAR TRIP

Alison Miners, 57, thought she had applied for a new passport in plenty of time for her holiday when she sent it off six weeks ago.

But when it still had not arrived this week, she was forced to travel 200 miles from Cwmbran, South Wales, to the Passport Office in Liverpool. ‘It’s been stressful,’ Mrs Miners said. ‘I burst into tears in front of an open-plan office at work on Wednesday and had to ask them if I could go. They were nice about it, but I could have lost my job.’ A £120 CAB FARE

Steve Davis, 51, was so desperate to get his hands on a new passport, he paid more for a taxi journey to Liverpool than he did for the service. Mr Davis, from Bradford, said: ‘I paid £120 for a taxi – and I’ve only paid £103 for my passport.’

June 10 Home Secretary Theresa May rejects claims the passport service is at risk of breaking down. She says 97 per cent of applications are dealt with on time.

June 11 The Mail reveals families hit by the passport crisis are being asked to pay £55 extra a person to save their summer holidays by fast-tracking their documents. David Cameron, urged to ‘get a grip’ on the crisis, admits up to 10 per cent of the 300,000 extra applications have been delayed – affecting 30,000 people. But he denies there is a crisis.
