Google has had to apologise for accidentally wiping a small Scottish island from its Maps service.

The Isle of Jura should be shown off the west coast of the Scottish Kintyre Peninsula yet when users search for island on Google Maps a red outline appears where the land should be.

Google said it was 'so sorry' for the mistake and added its engineers are 'bevearing away' to fix the flaw. 

Google has had to apologise for accidentally wiping the small Scottish island of Jura from its Maps service. When users search for the island all that appears is a red outline, pictured where the mass of land should be

BBC News was the first site to notice that the mass of land had vanished.

It is visible on Google Earth and on the Satellite view of Google Maps, yet when the page is switched to Maps view, the island disappears.

Jura is part of Scotland's Inner Hebrides archipelago and is situated in between Islay and the Kintyre Peninsula off the west coast of the UK country. 

It only has around 200 residents that live in an area of approximately 140 square miles.

The island is renowned for its whisky and its deer, which outnumber the people 25 to one. 

It is only accessible by a small ferry that stops running at 18.30, small boats from Colonsay to Loch Tarbert or by water taxi.

A Google spokesman told the BBC: 'We are sorry about that.

'We're aware of the problem, and our engineers are beavering away to fix it.

'We hope to have the map of Jura back to normal as soon as possible.'

Google Maps has suffered similar mishaps before.

For a month last summer the city of Sunrise in Florida vanished from the map while users were redirected to Sarasota.

And in 2011, Google Maps placed the harbour in Emden, Germany, under Dutch sovereignty.

This border dispute is said to date back to the 15th Century.

According to the Dutch, the harbor lies between the northern Netherlands and Germany, but Germans claim the entire estuary as their territory.
