Flirting with cabin crew is one way of passing the time on board a flight - but research has revealed it's often in vain as only 6 per cent of cases develop into something more meaningful. 

Surprisingly only 14 per cent of Britons who have been on a plane in the past two years have attempted to flirt with a member of the cabin crew.

While 37 per cent of these felt that the cabin crew member flirted back with them, 11 per cent said they were ignored by the person for the remainder of the flight and only six per cent said it actually went somewhere after the journey. 

According to a survey, 14 per cent of Brits have admitted to flirting with cabin crew on board their flight

Of the 14 per cent of Britons who admit to flirting, 37 per cent said they received the same back

Jetcost.co.uk conducted the research as part of an ongoing study into the way airline passengers keep themselves entertained and interact with fellow passengers during a flight.

A total of 2,749 respondents from the UK, all of whom were aged 18 and over and stated that they'd been on a flight in the last two years, were quizzed about their flying experiences. 

When the 14 per cent of 'flirters' were asked why they did this, they stated that they had 'found them attractive' (37 per cent), 'heard stories about flight attendants' (21 per cent) and 'I was dared to' (18 per cent). Only 6 per cent of those who had flirted with a member of the cabin crew admitted that their efforts had lead to the pair swapping contact details and meeting at a later date.

1. Listen to music – 73 per cent

2. Talk to fellow passengers – 68 per cent

3. Watch in-flight movies – 56 per cent

4. Sleep – 49 per cent

5. Read a magazine / book – 35 per cent

6. Flirting with cabin crew – 14 per cent 

Those who had admitted to flirting with flight attendants were also asked how the cabin crew member had responded at the time, with 37 per cent of them stating the person had flirted back, while 23 per cent admitted they'd looked a bit taken aback and 11 per cent said the flight attendant had tried to avoid them for the remainder of the flight. 

Men were twice as likely as women to flirt with cabin crew staff, according to the findings.

In order to determine if this was purely a UK trend or something that was becoming popular with all those around Europe, 1,000 people from European countries outside of the UK were polled. 

When asked 'Have you flirted with a member of the cabin crew on a flight before?' 36 per cent of respondents from Spain said 'yes', with a further 22 per cent from Germany, 15 per cent from France and only seven per cent from Italy saying the same. 

Spain topped the polls for the greatest number of people admitting to flirting on planes

Furthermore, only 13 per cent of those from Spain and four per cent from France admitted that the flirtatious behaviour had carried on past the flight.

Antoine Michelat, co-founder of Jetcost.co.uk, said: 'Hooking up with a flight attendant seems to be a bit of a fantasy for many Britons; it makes you wonder if this is because of how they're portrayed in the movies. 

'Either way, it's not particularly nice for the cabin crew team when it happens, and it must happen to them on such a regular basis they see it coming before you even get chance to speak to them. 

'If you think about it, it's not the wisest idea either because you're then trapped on a plane with them for a few hours, so if it goes horribly wrong or you don't get the reaction you expected, you're stuck in a confined space with them until the flight lands.'
