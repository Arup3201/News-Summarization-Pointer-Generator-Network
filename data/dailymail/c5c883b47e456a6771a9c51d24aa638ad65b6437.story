Britain's bakers have pleaded with David Cameron to put sandwiches back on the menu after the Prime Minister declared he was giving up bread to lose weight.

Letters have been sent to No 10 from the Federation of Bakers, which represents manufacturers, and the Craft Bakers Association on behalf of 600 High Street bakers.

They are upset because sales of supermarket bread have declined by nine per cent in two years, largely due to the trend for ‘low-carb’ diets. 

Tasty: David Cameron is seen here admiring some loaves of bread, but has now cut back as he pursues a low-carb diet - causing Federation of Bakers to write to Downing Street

Federation director Gordon Polson said: ‘We have to combat this idea that carbs are bad for you. If you go to a dietician they don’t tell you to stop the carbs. The Government recommends they should be a third of your diet.’

The Prime Minister said recently that he was now watching what he eats and taking extra exercise, after admitting: ‘I have put on a bit of Christmas. I can feel a bit of tightening around the belt buckle.’ 

Mr Cameron added: ‘I was out pounding the pavements on a run yesterday and I will be doing a bit of light dieting over the next few weeks and hopefully I will shed the pounds.

'I’m running a couple of miles every other day. It is easier to put it on than to take it off.’

Cautious: The Prime Minister has admitted he is watching what he eats and taking extra exercise - including a New Year run - after putting on weight last year

Mr Cameron said he did not weigh himself but admitted he realised he had gained weight after photos emerged of him taking part in an annual Christmas mud run in his constituency of Witney in Oxfordshire. 

The Prime Minister has spoken several times about his battle with middle-age spread.

In an interview with Now magazine in 2012 he was asked about his New Year’s resolutions and replied: ‘Probably to lose a bit of weight, I think. That’s the key one for me.’
