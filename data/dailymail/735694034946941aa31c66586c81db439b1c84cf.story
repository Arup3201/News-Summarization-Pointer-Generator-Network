A Christmas storm could drench the East Coast next week and ruin holiday travel plans for millions.

According to forecasts, rain and snow will sweep virtually the whole eastern seaboard from Monday, pushing showers as far west as Texas.

On Tuesday and Christmas Eve the precipitation is expected to intensify, with strong winds and rain storms lashing vital commuter routes along the I-95 corridor and causing a travel nightmare those headed home.

Storm's brewing: On the east coast rains could begin as early as Monday and drive up the coast

Spread: By Tuesday the rain is forecast to cover around a third of the country, including virtually the whole eastern seaboard and the South

Snow could also take hold around the northernmost states, with wind effect snow pummeling areas around the Great Lakes and Ohio valley, according to the Weather Channel.

The coming storms - whose precise tracks remain uncertain - will be bad news for many of the 98million people that the AAA expects to make significant Christmas journeys this year.

The vast majority of travelers will go by car, contributing to what is expected to be the busiest Christmas travel season since records began.

Air passengers - expected to number 5.7million - could also suffer, with the fierce winds and rains threatening to choke up hub airports in the northeast, with conditions particularly intense on Christmas Eve.

Iced Christmas: The rain eases off for the big day, according to this forecast, as snow continues to strike Pennsylvania, upstate New York and much of New England

The bad weather is expected to kick in Monday, with rain spread right along much of the East Coast from mid-Florida as high as New York, with precipitation falling as snow in the west of the Empire State and parts of Pennsylvania.

On Tuesday the predicted storms get worse, with rain pushing west over all the South, as far as west Texas.

A mixture of rain, snow and ice is expected over New England. Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Illinois are also predicted to be pummeled with rain, with snow replacing it further west over Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin.

The bad weather is expected to keep up through Christmas Eve. Thunderstorms could strike alongside high winds in the I-95 corridor, while a cold front may sweep in from the Great Lakes and freeze over Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia.

Rain will continue over virtually the whole East Coast, according to the predictions, causing trouble at major airports just as many will be hoping to catch a last-minute flight to reunite with friends and family.

A rain and snow storm will move in at the same time over the upper west coast, bringing rain and ice across Washington, Oregon and northern California.

On Christmas Day itself the rain is expected largely to have abated, but snow will be the order of the day in the northeast, with flurries due over Pennsylvania, upstate New York, Vermont and New Hampshire. 

The predicted bad weather makes a holiday double whammy for the year after rains and snow devastated travelers over Thanksgiving.
