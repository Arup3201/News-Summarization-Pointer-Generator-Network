A coyote spotted roaming around a Manhattan park was captured after cops shot it with tranquilizer darts. 

The animal was spotted on the Upper West Side in Riverside Park by a woman at 9:30pm who called police.

When authorities arrived the animal sprinted off - leaving officers to run after it. 

Cops have caught a coyote trapped in a Manhattan basketball court on Saturday night.  It took officers an hour-and-a-half to capture the black and white animal - she was hit by two tranquilizer darts

'It's been running back and forth from 72nd and 79th streets and Riverside Drive,' said one officer to the New York Post.

'We're just trying not to hurt the little guy.'

It took officers an hour-and-a-half to capture the animal - she was hit by two tranquilizer darts.

The NYPD 24th Precinct updated its followers on Twitter about the progress of the capture 

The NYPD 24th Precinct updated its followers on Twitter and tweeted: Sorry for the delay-took a while. Had it corralled inside fenced-in BB court, but so cold out, the tranquilizer in the darts kept freezing!

It then added: 'NYPD Emergency Services did a great job & the coyote is unharmed (although now she is a little sleepy). The question is: What to name her?' 

The animal will eventually be released back into the wild. 

There have been an increased number of sighting of coyotes in New York in recent year -in June a coyote was found dead in the Bronx.

The animals have adapted to living in close quarters with humans and have learned to navigate tasks associated with built-up areas - such as crossing busy roads and avoiding cars.

Over the past few years they have spread to nearly every corner of the United States - wreaking havoc by preying on domestic pets and even attacking children. 

They are strictly nocturnal, curling up in a ball during the day just yards from where people walk, and are able to defend large settlement areas. 

In December police in Northern California shot and killed a wild coyote after it bit a man and a child and tried to attack a third person in separate attacks in residential neighborhoods on Christmas.

Police shot and killed the animal after it bit the 42-year-old man and the 5-year-old boy on separate streets nearly a mile apart. 

Police say the attacks started when the coyote quietly approached the man and bit his leg as he was walking to his car with his children. 

The man ran with his children to a house and the coyote followed them, but he got everyone inside and shut the door before the coyote could get in, police said. The coyote left the area after several minutes, and officers searched but couldn't find it.

Less than an hour later, a runner more than half a mile away said he was chased by what he described as a wolf. He kicked off the animal and wasn't hurt.

Officers were later told that a child in the same area was bitten on the leg.

The boy's father ran to his aid and tried to scare the animal away.
