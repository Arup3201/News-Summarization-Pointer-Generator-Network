A man who posted videos of himself injecting substances into pregnant dogs and performing a C-section on a dog has been arrested at his home in Homestead.

Lazaro Ruiz, 26, is charged with animal cruelty and resisting arrest.

Police had been on the man's case for more than a year before they finally carried out a search of a townhouse in Homestead near Miami. Ruiz has now been jailed on animal cruelty charges.

The dogs found on Tuesday were mostly pit bull mixes, and they are all now safe in the custody of Animal Services.

In the dog house: Lazaro Ruiz, 26, was charged with resisting arrest, battery on a police officer, animal cruelty, pretending to be a veterinarian and illegally selling animals

Four dogs are on the road to recovery after, officials said, their owner abused them and posted disturbing photos of the canines on social media

Police said some puppies were suffering from obvious injuries many of which appeared to have been inflicted onto the dogs on purpose. 

One YouTube video showed the 26-year old feeding the dogs a bowl of raw chicken and ground beef. In another, he super-glued the dogs' ears to pieces of cardboard after slicing them in his home, he said in the video.

Police saw the videos and received pictures but were unable to act until finally a witness came forward last week with tales of purchasing pit bull puppies outside a Walmart in Florida City.

He saw Ruiz administer some type of drug into the back leg of a pregnant pit bull that was having trouble giving birth.

Police reportedly obtained a picture of Lazaro cutting a female dog's stomach to perform a C-section.

On YouTube, investigators found a video of Lazaro who stated that 'He freshly cropped three pairs of Doberman dogs using a home remedy.'

It is also believed he used scissors to crop the ears of several of his dogs.

Extreme cruelty: Officials said he is responsible for putting the dogs through excruciating pain. Ruiz allegedly performed a C-section on a pregnant dog and cropped young puppies' ears with scissors.

Videos showed things like dogs fighting over food, puppies locked in a kennel and a puppy eating with its ears clipped.

Police said Ruiz does not have a veterinary license, and it has been illegal to own a pit bull in Miami-Dade for well over a decade. 

The arrest didn't come without a struggle. Police set up a fake purchase and made their way to Ruiz's home, where they had to wrestle him to the ground and an officer injured his hand during the scrap.

According to authorities, Ruiz is a back-door breeder, who illegally breeds pit bulls and Doberman's to fight or to sell.

'I've been involved in animal welfare for 10 years, and honestly this is the most arrogant and outrageous case of abuse I've ever seen,' said Jacqueline Johnston of No Paw Left Behind.

'There were some bully mix dogs and one bully mix puppy with the ears removed all the way to the base of the ear.'

Ruiz posted a series sick videos online showing off his pups, but cops still didn't have enough information to track him down

This two-month-old puppy has since been renamed Little Red and is said to be 'very nervous'

Animal rescue workers were tipped off to this case because of several videos they say Ruiz posted online, which show the dogs being abused.

One YouTube video showed the 26-year old encouraging two young Dobermans to fight over a bowl of raw chicken and ground beef

Investigators from Miami-Dade Animal Services and Homestead police first got a look at Ruiz in July when they linked an address obtained from one of the videos to his girlfriend. An inspection of the property found three adult dogs in 'grave distress,' in crates with no shade as the temperature inside the covering reached almost 120 degrees.  

Police caught a bigger break last week when the witness who bought the pit bull puppies outside Walmart came forward. 

Police set up a fake purchase on Monday, calling Ruiz and agreeing to meet his girlfriend at a Homestead fire station. 

The woman then took police to Ruiz's home. When police entered the home and called out for Ruiz, he came toward them swinging his fists and swearing and yelling, 'You can't touch me,' according to the arrest report.

A struggle ensued, and police eventually got Ruiz under control, but not before an officer broke a finger and tore a tendon on his right hand.

Miami-Dade Animal Services confiscated four dogs from Ruiz's home, all American bulldog and terrier mixes. They will be put up for adoption when Ruiz's case is resolved.

Animal Services Director Alex Muñoz called it a relief 'that this individual's reign of terror against innocent animals has come to an end.'

In another video he described his 'ghetto' method of cropping puppies' ears: he super-glued the dogs' ears to pieces of cardboard after slicing them in his home, he said in the video.
