A gang of Muslim women who attacked a passer-by in a city centre walked free  from court after a judge heard they were ‘not used  to being drunk’ because of their religion.

The group – three sisters and a cousin – allegedly screamed ‘kill the white slag’ as they set upon Rhea Page as she waited for a taxi with her boyfriend.

Miss Page, 22, was left with a bald patch where her hair was pulled out in the attack and was left ‘black and blue’ after suffering a flurry of kicks to the head, back, arms and legs while motionless on the pavement.

Attack: Three of the young women can be seen setting upon Rhea Page, 22, in the centre of Leicester. Despite leaving her traumatised, they were handed suspended sentences

Victim: Rhea Page, 22, lost her job after being traumatised by the attack by a gang of Somalian girls

Ambaro Maxamed, 24, students Ayan 
Maxamed, 28, and Hibo Maxamed, 24, and their 28-year-old cousin Ifrah 
Nur each admitted actual bodily harm, which carries a maximum sentence 
of five years’ imprisonment.

But Judge Robert Brown gave them 
suspended jail terms after hearing mitigation that as Muslims, the women
 were not used to being drunk. The Koran prohibits Muslims from 
consuming alcohol, although Islamic teachings permit its use for 
medicinal purposes.

After the sentencing, Ambaro Maxamed 
wrote on her Twitter account: ‘Happy happy happy!’, ‘I’m so going out’, 
and ‘Today has been such a great day’.

Yesterday Miss Page, a care worker, called the sentence ‘disgusting’ and said the gang deserved ‘immediate custody’.

‘It’s no punishment at all,’ she said.
 ‘And for them to say they did it because they were not used to alcohol 
is no excuse. If they were not supposed to be drinking then they 
shouldn’t have been out in bars at that time of night.

‘Even after the police came and they all ran away, one of them came running back to kick me in the head one last time.

‘I honestly think they attacked me just because I am white. I can’t think of any other reason.’

Miss Page was treated for bruises and 
grazes after the attack in June last year as she walked to a taxi rank 
with boyfriend Lewis Moore, 23, in Leicester city centre.

At the time she worked caring for 
people with autism and learning difficulties but gave up the job after 
repeated absences because of stress and flashbacks.

She is still having counselling and suffers panic attacks.

She said: ‘We were just minding our 
own business but they kept shouting “white bitch” and “white slag” at 
me. When I turned around one of them grabbed my hair then threw me on 
the ground.

‘They were taking turns to kick me over and over. I thought they were going to kill me.’

None of the defendants was charged 
with racial aggravation. Nur claimed Mr Moore, a fence builder, had been
 racially abusive, but this was not accepted by the prosecution.

Gary Short, mitigating for Ambaro 
Maxamed, said the attack was down to alcohol. He said: ‘Although Miss 
Page’s partner used violence, it doesn’t justify their behaviour.

‘They’re Somalian Muslims and alcohol or drugs isn’t something they’re used to.’

The four women, who all live in 
Leicester, were each sentenced to six-month jail terms, suspended for 12
 months, at Leicester Crown Court last month.

Hibo Maxamed also received a 
four-month curfew between 9pm and 6am, while the others were ordered to 
carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

Judge Brown said that ‘those who knock someone to the floor and kick them in the head can expect to go inside’.

But he said he accepted the women may 
have felt they were the victims of unreasonable force from Mr Moore as 
he tried to defend his girlfriend, and handed the defendants a suspended
 sentence.

Speaking at her home, Hibo Maxamed 
said: ‘I’m not proud of it, it’s not something I want to talk about. I 
just want to get on with my life.’

When asked if she wanted to apologise, she replied: ‘What, to the public? I really don’t care.'

Victims: Rhea, 22, was with her partner Lewis Moore, 23, when she was attacked. He tried to defend her, the court was told
