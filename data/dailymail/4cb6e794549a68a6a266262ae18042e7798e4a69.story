A grandmother has died from rabies after being turned away from the same hospital twice.

Sharanjit Ubhi, 58, was bitten by her son's pet dog when she was visiting him in India. The dog gave her the fatal disease and when she went to Darent Valley Hospital, Kent, two months later, complaining of pain in her right arm, she was turned away.

Mrs Ubhi had not mentioned being bitten by a dog and her observations appeared 'normal' but when she developed hydrophobia the family's GP recognised the symptoms and sent her for specialist treatment.

However, it was too late and she became the first person in the UK to die from rabies for seven years.

Sharanjit Ubhi initially went to Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent, but she did not mention a dog bite and observations showed up 'normal'

The inquest at St Pancras Coroners Court ruled Mrs Ubhi died of brain and heart failure as a result of rabies infection.

Giving a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe said: 'This was not a natural cause of death. It is quite clear this death resulted from an untoward incident, namely an injury by a dog.

'Whilst in India in March 2012 Mrs Ubhi was playing with a puppy and sustained a minor injury to her arm. But despite maximum treatment she died on May 27th, 2012, as a result of an accidental injury.'

The mortality rate of rabies is almost
 100 per cent if people who are bitten do not seek help within a few 
weeks of the symptoms starting to show.

The
 viral infection is spread by infected animals to humans most commonly 
by biting or scratching. It can also be spread by animal saliva coming 
into contact with a graze or cut on a human’s skin.

As well as other symptoms some victims also develop hydrophobia - a fear of water.

There are about 55,000 cases of rabies worldwide, but half occur in India.

The
 last known case of rabies in England occurred in July 2005 when a woman
 from Manchester died after contracting it from a dog bite in the Indian
 resort of Goa.

In 2002 
David McRae became the first person to die of the disease in Britain for
 100 years after being bitten on the hand by a rabid bat in Scotland.

Since 1946, 24 people have died after being infected with rabies abroad. Four of these were since 2000.

Speaking after the inquest Mrs Ubhi's son Gurpreet, 29, said: 'The stigma behind rabies is that it's a big, drooling dog with bloodshot eyes that bites you.

'But this wasn't. It was a puppy so small you could pick it up in the palm of your hand. My mum wasn't even bitten, it was a nick, and when she showed it me I had to squint to see it.

'It's a tragedy what's happened to our family, but if this can highlight to Brits travelling abroad the importance of being properly vaccinated maybe something good can come out of this.'

Speaking at her inquest today, her family said that the bite was so small she did not think of getting herself checked out by a doctor at the time.

It was only when she suffered three days of pain in her arm while at home in Dartford, Kent, that she sought help from doctors.

She was put into isolation at University College Hospital, London, but died on May 27 this year.

Gurpreet Ubhi, her son, told the inquest that the family was 'totally distraught'.

He said: 'What happened was a tragedy. It was very rare. My mum was a strong person. This is probably the only thing that kept my mum down.

Describing what happened he
 said: 'It wasn’t a bite as such. It was actually a pup which was so 
small she could hold it in the palm of her hand, not a big dog as has 
been depicted.

She was taken to University College Hospital, London, where she was treated in isolation but died as a result of rabies

'She was playing around with it and there was a slight nick on her arm. It was so minute it didn’t even register to her to get it checked out.'

Back in England Mr Ubhi said his mother seemed fine until a week-and-a-half before she got seriously ill.

'She said she had pain in her arm. In hindsight you think I could have done so much more but at the time we still didn’t think anything of it. I told her to take a paracetamol and go to bed and said in the morning you’ll be fine,' he said.

But the next day Mrs Ubhi’s symptoms had got worse and she complained of a burning sensation in her arm.

Her son said: 'That’s when she actually told me what had happened in India three months ago.'

A spokesman for Darent Valley Hospital said: 'We offer our sincere condolences to the family and friends of this poor lady. The UK is rabies free.

'If a patient does present at hospital with vague symptoms a doctor is unlikely to consider rabies as a diagnosis unless the patient highlights animal contact in an at-risk country. The hospital responded to the information supplied by the patient at the time.'
