Anyone planning on moving to New York City or San Francisco may want to consult their bank account before they hire a real estate agent, because the two cities are almost exclusively for the rich, according to recently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

New York and San Francisco have always been pricey places to live, but the new data shows that the once economically diverse municipalities are now dominated by the wealthy more than ever before.

To illustrate the widening gap between the rich and poor in cities like San Francisco and New York, the Census Bureau has created map images that show the difference of income in respective cities from 1990 and 2012.

Rich: The census map indicates that more of Manhattan is inhabited by people who make more than $75,000 a year than in 1990

City by the Bay: the vast majority of neighborhoods in San Francisco are home to people making more than $75,000 per year

The images show a clear shift in the economic demographics of several neighborhoods in both New York and San Francisco. 

The darkest red sections of the maps denote areas with a median household income of $75,000 per year or more.

The lightest white areas on the map show areas with a median household income of $35,000 a year or less. The other colors indicate a range of median incomes between $35,000 and $75,000 per year.

Motor City: The median household income in Detroit has significantly dropped since 1990 in many areas

Windy City: Like Detroit, Chicago also has seen a decline in median income in many areas

Downtown Las Vegas appears to have run out of luck, while outlying areas have seen an increase in median income

In both cases, many areas that were once lighter shades of orange or tan - areas with median incomes less than $75,000 - are now dark red, indicating that wealthier people and families are moving in.

The average incomes of New York state and California are $57,683 and $61,400 per year, respectively.

Economic diversity in other cities - like Detroit and Chicago - seem to have shifted in the opposite direction, with more of the city now having a median income of less than $35,000 than in 1990.
