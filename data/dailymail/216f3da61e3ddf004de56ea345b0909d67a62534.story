This grandiose heritage-listed mansion is the perfect setting for romance.

So much so, it has been rumoured that a hefty $25,000 is being paid each week for Network Ten's reality dating series The Bachelor.

The waterfront estate named Clifton located in Hunters Hill - Sydney's affluent north shore, has been owned by the McCaffrey family since 1993 when they bought it for $2.75 million, reported the Property Observer.

Although the official payment figure from production company Shine Australia has not been confirmed, it was reported that the ritzy estate was available for rent for $1,500 a week.

Before the show aired, Channel Ten uploaded a series of pictures to The Bachelor Australia's Facebook page revealing the stunning 120-year-old property expands over 5,124 square metres - just as lavish as last year's set at Bayview's La Joie de Vivre in Sydney's northern beaches.

The debut episode of Australia's second season of The Bachelor on Wednesday night also showed a glimpse of the luxurious mansion where the war for love takes place.

The 24 girls, who are fighting for Blake Garvey's love, officially moved into the mansion on Wednesday night.

The 31-year-old was tasked to cull the group down to just 20, meaning four girls had to say goodbye to the man, and the house, of their dreams.

The give who received a rose meant they were safe from elimination but not all roses were equal.

The white rose, new to the franchise, protects a girl from elimination during two rose ceremonies, which was enough for the 24 ladies to ramp up their wooing attempts.

And it was 23-year-old Holly, the first girl Australia was introduced to, that ended up snagging the coveted flower.
