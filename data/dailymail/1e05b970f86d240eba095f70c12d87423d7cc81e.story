The story of an exasperated New York Cosmos executive who, frustrated by the legendary Franz Beckenbauer's reluctance to stray from his defensive domain, remarked 'tell the Kraut to get his ass up front and score some goals', might possibly be the stuff of urban myth; a tall tale invented to mock America's ignorance of what they call soccer.

The one about the American sports reporter who cried foul because the US had to play both Trindad and Tobago on the same day in World Cup qualifying, sadly, is not.

That was in 1989 when Paul Caligiuri's goal in Port of Spain sent the US through to their first finals in 40 years. Optimistically they called it 'the shot heard round the world' but, in truth, there was little genuine interest even in their own country. The North American Soccer League had folded four years earlier, taking the star-studded Cosmos with it, and soccer faced a bleak future.

A quarter of a century on, and it is a rather different scenario. This summer the US national team's progress in the World Cup in Brazil has sparked unprecedented interest among the American public, while English clubs have been beating a path Stateside like never before.

Arsenal were here for the first time in 25 years and there is already talk of both Manchester clubs coming back next summer. A sell-out crowd of 109,000 watched United's game against Real Madrid in Michigan and despite the pitch problems City encountered in Minnesota, there is no doubting the club's belief in this most valuable of markets.

City's American brand New York City FC will launch in the burgeoning Major League Soccer next year. They will soon be followed by a new Miami team owned by David Beckham, whose move to LA Galaxy in 2007 made the world sit up and take notice of MLS.

'It's not a promise any more, it's a reality,' says Manchester City chief executive Ferran Soriano. 'No matter how you look at it, soccer is the No.1 global sport and there is no reason for it not to be growing in the US – I think it's unstoppable.'

'Frank Lampard was telling me that only five years ago he could walk on the street in New York and nobody would recognise him. Now he can't.'

Lampard and David Villa are New York's star signings. A third 'designated player' is allowed by a league still treading cautiously, anxious to avoid the lavish folly of the NASL.

No-one is kidding themselves that Lampard and Villa would have considered coming here at the height of their careers. But the days when star players from Europe and South America – Pele, Beckenbauer and Best – could enjoy an easy pay-day at the end of their careers are in the past.

'All the players are well aware that this isn't a retirement league,' said New York City's director of football Claudio Reyna. 'In saying that, I'm waiting for some of these big players who want to come who aren't looking for the money.

'The business model of the old NASL didn't work and that's why the league collapsed. It wasn't sustainable. MLS has done a great job in making sure the league grows at the right pace. We need to continue to be mindful of our growth but we're ready to take the next step.'

Progress has been built on the popularity of youth soccer, a football-mad Hispanic population (up from 14million in the days of the NASL to 55m now), and massively increased media coverage of the sport.

Soccer is increasingly prominent on the television screens dotted around bars across America. Curiously, one in downtown Manhattan last week was showing a re-run of last season's Championship Playoff Final between QPR and Derby on the big screen. These days, almost every Premier League game can be watched live on the NBC Sports Network.

'It's like being locked in a candy store,' says veteran New York soccer writer Michael Lewis. 'There is no stopping the sport now. When the NASL went out of business, I feared it would be difficult for big-time soccer at that level to come back. I would never have predicted what we have here today.'

Driven by an ambition to tap into the massively profitable US sports market, obligated by sponsorship deals like United's £355m partnership with car giant Chevrolet, and attracted by first-class sports facilities, nine Premier League clubs have played in America this summer.

It's not only the soccer hotspots of LA, New York and Chicago either. The International Champions Cup brought City here to Minneapolis, Liverpool to Charlotte and United to Ann Arbor. Swansea City pitched up in Milwaukee and Blaine, Minnesota.

As the last of them arrived home on Tuesday, they leave behind a country still dizzy on a World Cup high that saw Jurgen Klinsmann's team qualify from a group including Portugal, Ghana and Germany. They only lost by a single goal to the eventual world champions before going out with all guns blazing against Belgium, and afterwards President Barack Obama called captain Clint Dempsey and goalkeeper Tim Howard to offer his congratulations.

There is still much work to be done; many people to convince and convert. But it appears that football has finally established a foothold on the American sports landscape. Even the Cosmos are back, albeit in a reduced capacity.

'Soccer has grown in popularity and it exploded at the World Cup,' says MLS executive vice-president Dan Courtemanche. 'It captured the hearts and minds of the US public like never before. This is truly a rising soccer nation and it's ripe for MLS to take advantage.

'In the past, if the person next to me on a plane asked what I do, they would say, 'when will soccer make it in the US?'. This summer we passed that mark – that discussion won't take place in the future.'

US residents purchased 196,000 tickets for this summer’s World Cup before the tournament began. That was more than any other country apart from hosts Brazil, and more than England, Germany and France combined.

Major League Soccer has grown from 10 teams in 2004 to 19 this season. Orlando and New York City will launch next year, Atlanta in 2017 and David Beckham’s Miami franchise will raise the total to 23. Of the current 19 teams, 15 play in stadiums built or renovated for soccer.

MLS average attendance ranks third among America’s professional sports leagues behind the NFL and MLB, and ahead of the NBA and NHL.

MLS has signed a new £330m eight-year television deal with Fox Sports, ESPN and Univision which is worth almost five times the current agreement with NBC. That is still dwarfed by the new £23.5billion deal the NFL has signed with US networks to show American football over the same period.

Having failed to qualify for the World Cup for 40 years before 1990, the US has reached the last seven tournaments. Only Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Italy, South Korea and Spain have done the same.
