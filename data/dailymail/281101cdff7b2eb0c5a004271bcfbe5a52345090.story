It was tied deliberately in a simple knot around the girl's neck, but was not a hangman's noose, St. Clair County Sheriff Terry Surles said.

Salers went to bed after she was taken to the hospital but was arrested in the early hours of the morning.

Police said he admitted to killing Katelynn and told officers a motiveâ€”but that motive was not revealed.

The boy and girl were living with their aunt and uncle as part of a foster home situation, Surles said.

According to the Katelynn's maternal grandfather John Henry Arnold, this was because their mother struggled with personal problems.

'She had problems and was working on them,' Arnold told WBRC last year. 'She's not handling this very well at all.'

Nevertheless, he said, 'the kids were where they should be.'

Arnold said at the time that he believes his granddaughter's death was an accident.

'I've never seen him angry or aggressive or nothing like that,' Arnold said of Salers.

Katelynn had been riding her bicycle on Thursday evening and her aunt noticed she was missing so drove around looking for her for 45 minutes.

When she returned home, she found the girl handing from a tree outside the home. The sheriff's department was called at 8.10 p.m.

Adult: St. Clair County Sheriff Terry Surles said the rope had deliberately been knotted. The district attorney's request to try Salers as an adult for the crime has been granted

By the time officers arrived, rescuers had removed Katelynn from the tree. She was pronounced dead at a hospital.

An autopsy showed she died as a result of strangulation by ligature and her death was ruled as a homicide.

The case has now been turned over to a grand jury.

The girl was remembered as a 'sweet little angel' by her school principal Roger Wilkinson. 'If you were a teacher, you'd like a room full of them,' he told the Birmingham News.
