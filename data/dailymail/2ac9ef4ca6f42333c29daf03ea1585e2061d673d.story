A horse rider who had her leg sliced off in a horrific motorbike crash is hoping to win a place in the Paralympics after learning to walk again with the help of a prosthetic limb made by her grandfather.

Kerry Waters, 30, was lucky to survive after being thrown from her motorcycle when she crashed into a ditch in October last year after being blinded by sunlight.

However, as she was flung from the motorbike, she collided with a telegraph pole and the supporting wire sliced her right leg off from just above the knee.

The horse enthusiast, from Ashingdon, Essex, was left distraught that she may never be able to walk or ride again, but has now surprised doctors by getting back on her feet after just four months.

The dental nurse, who has been riding horses since the age of two, now hopes to represent the UK at the Paralympics after her grandfather Dennis made her a prosthetic wooden leg.

She said: 'When I was lying in hospital I never thought I'd be back riding ever again, I thought it was all over for me.

'I was a very sporty person and I've had to learn to adjust my life around my leg, I think my passion to get back on the horse has helped my recovery.

'I've always loved horses and needed to start riding again, but the NHS were quite slow making a riding leg me so my granddad started work on his own version.

'It doesn't look very pretty but he painted the toenails pink for me just to give it a more girly feel.

'I'm a real fighter but it was tough learning how to walk with my prosthetic, thankfully my family and friends helped me get through it all.

'I don't think I could have done it without them - I'm eternally grateful.

'Sometimes I think they forget I've got a prosthetic leg when we're out walking and I have to ask them to slow down for me to catch up.'

She has now been given hope after her grandfather Dennis made her a prosthetic wooden leg to help her get back on her feet. He even went to the effort of painting the toenails on the false limb with pink nail varnish

Ms Waters (pictured with friends after a fundraising run) now leaves a fairly active life and goes to the gym

Ms Waters said she feared she would never walk or ride again after being thrown off her motorcyle in the crash last October.

She recalls: 'I remember looking down at the speedometer, I was doing 40mph and looked up to be blinded by the sun.

'Then the handlebars started shaking, I barely had time to think other than to realise the danger I was in and hit the ditch.

'I can't remember hitting the telegraph pole or the supporting wire that took my leg clean off.

'I woke up with my hands by my side facing down without my helmet. I started to panic and tried to stand up to see where it was.

'A lady came over to help me while I sat up, it was then that I realised I didn't have a leg.

'I kept shouting at her, asking where my leg was over and over.

'It was all very surreal, it's weird but there wasn't any pain at all.'

Before falling unconscious she managed to give her phone to the woman who came to her aid and asked her to call her family.

She was then airlifted by Essex Air Ambulance to St George's Hospital in London and rushed straight into surgery, where doctors decided to amputate to the knee because her wound so full of dirt and gravel.

Ms Waters was a keen biker before the crash in October last year in which she was thrown from her vehicle

Her leg was virtually sliced off in the crash but had to be further amputated above the knee due to the injury

Ms Waters has undergone four months of rehabilitation but is now able to walk with the help of prosthetics

Ms Waters also suffered a fractured femur and severe grazing across her body in the crash, leaving doctors no other option than to induce a coma with breathing apparatus to keep her alive.

She said: 'I remember waking up to my sister stroking my forehead and mum holding my hand, I was in a state of shock.

'I couldn't talk because there were tubes in my throat, all I could do was look at my missing leg.

'My mum couldn't keep eye contact with me and I panicked so much that I had to be sedated.

'All I kept thinking was how my life would change and how active I used to be, I really struggled to comprehend what happened.'

However, after months of rehabilitation she can now walk and ride again and uses the prosthetic limb to help her move forward with her life.

She said: 'My life has been completely changed, it's a struggle to put on my prosthetic leg but I still lead a very active life, I got to the gym several times a week and enter the Paralympics.

'I'm not as active as I used to be but I'm still able to do a lot.

Ms Waters said she is eternally grateful to her family for their support and help, particularly her grandfather Dennis (together left after the accident), who created her a wooden prosthetic leg to help get her riding again

The dental nurse has joined Riders for the Disabled Association in the hope of breaking through into the Paralympic team. She hopes she will be able to represent the UK at the Games with the help of her false leg

'At first I blocked the accident out - I don't think I'll ever be able to accept what happened - but I'm learning to live with it and at least I can still walk.

'I've overcame a lot to get where I am now, I keep setting the bar high and pushing myself more and more.'

Ms Waters has even joined her local Riders for the Disabled Association in the hope of breaking through into the Paralympic team.

She added: 'It's everyone's dream to represent their country doing something they love.

'I'm entering a lot of competitions and hope to be picked for the team.

'Horse riding for Great Britain after everything I've been through would be the best thing imaginable - I have a lot of fun riding and reckon I have a good chance.'
