Stuart Hall has appeared in court to face 15 charges of rape and one of indecent assault

Disgraced broadcaster Stuart Hall was 
led from prison to court in handcuffs yesterday to face new charges of 
raping two young girls.

The 
83-year-old, who is currently serving a 30-month jail term for sexually 
abusing 13 girls over a period of nearly 20 years, was charged with more
historic sexual offences last month.

The latest claims relate to two alleged victims aged between 11 and 16 at the time of the offences.

He
is said to have committed seven counts of rape against one girl between
January 1976 and September 1978 in Manchester when she was aged 16 and 
under.

Hall is also accused
of eight counts of rape and one count of indecent assault against a 
second girl between 1976 and 1981 at various locations in Manchester and
Cheshire.

Two female prison
officers ushered Hall out of a prison van with both hands chained 
together.

Another security guard in a fluorescent jacket stood behind 
him as he walked out into the rain.

The
former BBC broadcaster appeared to be holding a paperback book which he
handed to the security guard before being escorted into the underground
cells of Preston Magistrates’ Court.

Standing
in the dock Hall, dressed in a black suit, appeared unable to hear very
well during the brief 12-minute appearance.

Asked to identify himself, 
he replied: ‘I beg your pardon?’

Judge Jane Goodwin then asked the 
former It’s A Knockout presenter to confirm his date of birth and he 
once again appeared confused as he replied: ‘I’m sorry?’

Hall then sat 
down as he listened to the fresh charges against him.

Hall
did not enter any pleas to the charges and was remanded into custody.

District Judge Goodwin said the fresh allegations were ‘more serious’ 
and told Hall he would be sent back to prison to appear at Preston Crown
Court on November 29.

The charges against Hall relate to two alleged victims aged between 11 or 12 and 16 at the time

In 
June this year Hall, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, was jailed for just 15 
months after admitting that he indecently assaulted 13 girls between 
1967 and 1986.

The sentence prompted a wave of anger, with victims 
condemning it as ‘incredibly lenient’.

After receiving numerous 
complaints, Attorney General Dominic Grieve referred the case to the 
Court of Appeal which ruled that his original 15-month term was 
‘inadequate’ and his sentence was increased to 30 months.

Last month he was stripped of his OBE for broadcasting and charity work in the wake of his conviction.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
