The early bird really does catch the worm… but he saves it for dinner. 

Blue tits, great tits and other small garden birds scout for food in the morning but only return to eat it in the late afternoon, a study found.

The Oxford University researchers believe the strategy allows them to stock up on food while avoiding the clutches of predators. 

A full belly in the morning would slow them down in the hunt for food and make them easy prey.

So they search out food when lean and lithe and then dine in the evening to ensure they have a big enough store of fat to survive through the night. 

The ‘early bird’ strategy was revealed in an experiment in which over 2,000 birds were fitted with tiny radio tags which activated when they landed on feeders hidden in Wytham Woods, near Oxford.

The feeders were moved around over the course of the day and the researchers noted when the birds landed on them.

This revealed that the birds were much better at finding the feeders’ new locations in the morning.  However, they waited until the afternoon to get tucked in. 

The researchers said the complex strategy acts as an insurance policy, with birds remaining light yet still able to get enough fat to survive the night. 

It is particularly important in winter when the risks of predation are high and just one day without food can make the difference between life and death for small birds.

Zoologist Damien Farine said: ‘Birds have to store body fat to avoid starving during the cold winter nights, but this can make them slower and less manoeuvrable so they are more likely to be caught by predators.

‘So there is a trade-off, where birds need to remain lean enough in order to “outrun” their predators, or at least the next slowest bird, during the day but also store enough fat to survive each night.’

Writing in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, he added that the study shows that rather than ‘idly waiting’ to until the afternoon, the birds start searching out food in the morning.

‘Our results show these birds display very different patterns of food discovery in the morning and afternoon; very few new food sources were found during the afternoon, whereas nearly every new food source we put out during the morning was quickly discovered. 

‘It supports the idea of an ‘early bird’ strategy of scouting for food early on so they can return to feast a couple of hours before dusk in preparation for a long winter’s night.’
