Ryanair's loose-cannon boss Michael O'Leary is looking for a 'brave soul' to become his new spin doctor and take on what he calls the 'worst job in PR'.

The outspoken Irishman is well known for using madcap schemes to chase publicity and his current Director of Communications Stephen McNamara is leaving after 'four years of being battered and abused'.

There is an upside, however, as Mr O'Leary says the successful candidate will be 'high profile and incredibly overpaid'.

'Brave soul': Michael O'Leary is looking for a new Ryanair spin doctor after admitting he 'battered' the last one for four years

But the new man or woman faces an uphill struggle as consumer champions Which? have just named Ryanair the least-popular short-haul airline based on baggage allowance, boarding, seating allocation and food and drink.

And anyone who wants to take the challenge hasn't got long as applications will not be accepted after today.

In a statement announcing Mr McNamara's departure to the Irish Rugby Union, Mr O’Leary said: 'We look forward to recruiting another brave soul to take on the worst job in Irish PR and look forward to grooming the next candidate to take over the high profile and incredibly overpaid position.'

The statement said his spin doctor had been ‘battered and abused by Michael O'Leary on one side and the European media on the other' and ‘has decided to pursue an easier life’. 

Ryanair's campaigns and sometime gaffes have become legendary.

In the past it has floated many controversial cost-saving ideas and decisions that have infuriated passengers. But it will still fly 79.4million passengers this year.

Disliked: Ryanair is the least popular short-haul airline, according to a survey by Which? magazine released this week

The budget airline announced this year it 
is to reduce the size of its in-flight magazine and encourage its staff not to pile on the pounds.

The latest policy will see the airline's 
in-flight magazine 'Let's Go with Ryanair' being reduced from an A4 to 
an A5 format and it will also double as a menu, which could save 
thousands of pounds in fuel thanks to the reduced amount of paper used.

The low-cost carrier also estimates it will save more than £400,000 in printing costs.

Other
measures implemented include cutting the amount of ice taken on board a
flight, and reducing the weight of trolleys and seats.

Money-raising schemes have included removing conventional seating and offering air passengers just standing room.

The airline also faced an outcry in 2009 over plans to charge passengers a pound to visit the plane toilet, in a bid to limit loo facilities on the aircraft and replace them with extra seats.

Ryanair has also suggested it could put passengers in the hull, in bunks and has called for flights with only one pilot instead of the usual two.
