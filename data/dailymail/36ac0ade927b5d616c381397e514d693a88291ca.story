Hampshire have signed former West Indies fast bowler Fidel Edwards for the latter half of this summer.

Edwards will be registered as a Kolpak player and will arrive at the Ageas Bowl in late July. He will be available for all formats.

The 33-year-old from Barbados has played 55 Tests, 50 one-day internationals and 20 Twenty20 games for the Windies, taking 241 wickets across all formats with a Test best of seven for 87 against New Zealand in 2008.

Edwards has taken three international five-wicket hauls in England, his last coming in 2009 at Lords

He has taken three five-wicket international hauls in English conditions - five for 112 at Chester-le-Street in 2007 and six for 92 at Lord's in 2009 in Tests, and five for 45 in an ODI at Lord's in 2007.

Edwards said: 'I'm delighted to have signed for such an ambitious club as Hampshire. I hope I can play a part in helping to bring success to the Ageas Bowl this year.

'I'm very much looking forward to my first taste of county cricket. It's also an honour to follow other Bajans like Malcolm Marshall and Gordon Greenidge to Hampshire.'

Director of cricket Giles White added: 'Fidel is a good option for us - he arrives ahead of the Royal London One Day Cup and should give our attack variety which we feel is key in the 50-over format.'
