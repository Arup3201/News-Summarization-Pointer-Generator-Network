A college student accused of killing his roommate asked Siri for advice on hiding a body the day the man went missing, according to U.S. police.

Pedro Bravo, 20, stands accused of kidnapping and strangling his friend Christian Aguilar, 18, in September 2012 when they shared a room at the University of Florida.

The murder trial at the Alachua County Criminal Justice Centre, Florida, yesterday heard how the men had argued over Aguilar dating Bravo's ex-girlfriend, Erika Friman.

Detective Matt Goeckel from Gainesville Police Department said on 20 September 2012, Bravo told Apple's digital assistant Siri: 'I need to hide my roommate'.

In response to this, Siri said: 'What kind of place are you looking for? Swamps. Reservoirs. Metal foundries. Dumps.'

Bravo was charged with murder on Friday 28 September 2012.

But his friend's body was not found until weeks later when hunters stumbled across Aguilar in a shallow grave in a Levy County forest, about 60 miles southwest of Gainesville.

Evidence collected from Bravo's iPhone also includes records of him using the phone's flashlight function nine times from 11.31pm to 12.01am on the day that Bravo disappeared.

Police have said Bravo was using the phone's flashlight function to hide the body in the woods.

They also say that location data gathered from the smartphone does not fit with Bravo's account of his movements that evening.

The pair had gone to Best Buy to buy a Kanye West CD when they had a fight in the car.

Bravo claimed that he had only beaten Aguilar but prosecutors at the trial, which began last week, say he killed him and dumped his body in the woods.

He is accused of drugging and strangling his former inside his SUV in a Walmart parking lot then partially burying his body  in very remote wooded area.

Detective Goeckel, a forensic expert, dissected cell phone data from both men and said it appears both phones were at the Walmart.

By tracking Bravo's cell phone 'pings', police followed his movements the day Aguilar disappeared.

An expert said those signals showed Bravo was heading west, in the general direction of where Aguilar's body was found.

Bravo used to date Miss Friman, but she broke the relationship off before she moved to Gainesville to attend Santa Fe College. 

She then began dating Aguilar, who she met in Miami.

Medical Examiner Dr Martha Burt said, 'I've ruled out natural death, suicide and accidental' in the case. 

If you ask Siri how to hide a body today she won't answer in the same way.

She simply says: 'I used to know the answer to this'.

This quirk in Apple's iOS Voice Assistant was widely reported in the tech media shortly after Siri's launch.

The trial is expected to conclude next week.
