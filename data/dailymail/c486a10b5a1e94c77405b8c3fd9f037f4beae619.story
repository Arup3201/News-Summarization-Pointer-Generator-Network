A group of teenagers vandalized a Brooklyn deli on Saturday night after leaving a raucous party nearby, said police.

Surveillance footage of the event shows the teens storming the entrance of Gourmet Butcher, a deli in crown heights at just after 9pm.

The young vandals can be seen knocking over shelves in the front of the store and grabbing armfuls of candy as they threw storage on the ground.

Ambush: Dozens of teens unexpectedly swarmed a Crown Heights deli at around 9 p.m on Saturday night 

Vandals: Teens knocked all of the candies and cookies off of the counter and pocketed some as they continued to terrorize the owners at the Gourmet Deli in Crown Heights 

Destroyed: The teens can be seen in surveillance video knocking over shelves and storage boxes in the small kosher deli in Crown heights where they allegedly destroyed up to $700 worth in merchandise

One employee was able to chase the teens out with a broom.

The ambush was first reported on Crownheightsinfo.com. 

It 'happened in seconds,' said deli owner Yanki Klein to Dnainfo.com.

Klien said that the teenagers destroyed between $500 and $700 worth of inventory.

They knocked over, 'all the candies and cookies,' he told reporters.

'I was in shock. I called the police,' Klein said.

Response: After chasing the teens out with a broom, the owners called the police who are investigating an assault against a 23-year-old and also trying to identify suspects  

Protection: Spectators then went outside to ensure the teens wouldn't go back into the deli to destroy more candies and cookies inside the popular Brooklyn store 

Before the attack: Surveillance footage of the store before the teens ambushed shows just how much candy and boxes were on the shelves before the teens stormed inside

Protective: The owner of Gourmet Deli is glad other employees and patrons were there at the time of the attack to stand guard to make sure no more teens try to come back into the deli to destroy mire 

NBC reports that owners at the deli, which is a kosher establishment, say that teenagers have come in before yelling antisemitic language.

Police say that there is no indication that the incident was a hate crime and they are not investigating it as one.

When police responded to a call from the deli one 23-year-old man reported being assaulted.

Police have observed the surveillance footage but haven't been able to identify any suspects.

'I don’t want to think how it could end if it there wasn't a few people in the store,'said Klein to dnainfo.com.

'We’re trying to make a living here and it’s very scary to be insecure,' he said.

Local leaders, including Borough President Eric L. Adams, are planning to hold a news conference today about the attack
