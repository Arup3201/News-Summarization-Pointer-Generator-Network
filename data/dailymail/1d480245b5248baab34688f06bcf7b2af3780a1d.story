Jailed: Philip Burgess, 22, from Salford, was sentenced to three years for inciting violence during the Manchester riots

A Facebook user who posted on the social networking site that rioters should 'put Manchester on the map' has been jailed for three years.

Philip Burgess, from Salford, wrote the message when the August riots were at their most fervent, and urged his friends to wreak havoc in the city centre.

The 22-year-old, who admitted encouraging the commission of offences of riot and inciting racial hatred, sobbed as the sentence was handed down at Manchester Crown Court.

Unemployed Burgess logged on to 
Facebook on August 9 under his profile name 'Philip Rio Burgess', at 11.44am posted: 'Message to all - we need to start riot
 'n we need to put Manchester on the map, first lets riot king street 
Manchester, haha.'

At that point Manchester had not yet been targeted by rioters, but shortly afterwards trouble flared up in the city.

King 
Street, one of the most important thoroughfares of the city and an 
affluent shopping area, was hit within hours of the message being 
written, with marauding bands of hooded youths running amok.

The copycat riots in England's third-largest city - and 
nearby Salford, where Burgess lived - also saw widespread looting and 
vandalism which threatened to stretch police resources to breaking 
point.

Burgess went on to post a string of 
racist comments about the ethnicity of the rioters and also posted 'bring bk the riots' on Facebook in the 
aftermath of the violence. 

Manchester
 Crown Court heard his crime was so serious he would have to go to jail 
on the spot - and serve a sentence 'measured in years'.

The court heard that Burgess's remarks could potentially have been seen by his 475 Facebook 'friends' and anyone else who stumbled across his page.

Jonathan Sandiford, prosecuting, said: 'Within hours of the message being posted, rioting did occur in the very place named.

'In reality we can't say any person who saw the message decided to riot because of it, but it was plainly the defendant's intention and it may well have encouraged some of those who did behave in that way.' 

Burgess, who has a previous conviction for racially aggravated common assault, was arrested at his home on August 16, a week after posting the first message.

When cautioned he reportedly replied: 'Riot? I wanted to be part of it but I wasn't.' 

Two other young men, Jordan Blackshaw and Perry Sutcliffe-Keenan, are currently serving four-year sentences for encouraging people to riot in Cheshire.

The pair's bid to have their jail-time cut by the Court of Appeal failed earlier this month. 

David Abbot, defending Burgess, said he had not gone as far as Blackshaw and Sutcliffe-Keenan, who set up dedicated pages calling for disorder.

He said Burgess had 'got caught up in what was going on' and was remorseful and ashamed. 

Sentencing him, Judge Michael Henshell said the disorder in Manchester was 'simply lawlessness'.

He said of Burgess's remark: 'Even if one or two people had read it and talked about it to others, it had the potential of causing real public mischief.' 

Police constable John Hepke added: 'The widespread disorder in Manchester city centre and Salford drew disbelief and shock.

'Everyone witnessed the disgraceful scenes of violence, looting and arson and it is clear that social networking sites were used to incite certain elements of this disorder.

'At that time, Greater Manchester Police vowed that we would identify anyone involved in using social networking sites to stir up hatred, and once Burgess had been exposed, our team in Bolton was brought in to investigate.

'The sheer scale of the disorder meant that teams from across Greater Manchester Police were brought in to help bring the offenders to justice.

'The comments Burgess posted on Facebook were clearly designed to incite people to commit disorder in Manchester just hours before those awful scenes.

'Not content with that, he continued to post racist and inflammatory comments.

'I hope today's sentence sends a powerful message to those who choose to follow Burgess's example and use social networking sites irresponsibly and criminally that they will be dealt with harshly by the courts.'

Constable Ian Hopkins added: 'At the time of the disorder, we made a public pledge to our communities that we would pursue not just those involved in looting, violence or arson, but those who used social networking sites to stir up trouble and encourage others to get involved.

'The disorder brought shameful scenes to our cities and those who used social networking sites to organise what happened are just as responsible as those who physically took part.'
