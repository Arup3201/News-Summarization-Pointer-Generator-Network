A pet Siberian lynx attacked a woman who was feeding it in an affluent Atlanta neighborhood on Tuesday, landing her in the hospital with injuries to her head and raising questions about the right to raise exotic cats.

The owners of the dangerous animal were out of town and made arrangements with the woman to care for their exotic pet, police said. 

Another woman called police to say her friend, 21-year-old Rachel Hightower, had been attacked by the large cat, which can weigh up to 90 pounds.

The woman - identified only as Mackenzie, who had accompanied Hightower for the feeding - was heard in the 911 describing the attack.

Scene: Police say this Siberian lynx - which is kept as a pet by a licensed owner - attacked a woman who entered its enclosure in Atlanta on Tuesday

Investigation: Police inspect the large enclosure in the backyard of a home in Buckhead, an affluent suburb of Atlanta. At least 

Dangerous: There are at least nine exotic cats living on the property, four of which are Siberian lynxes 

'The next thing I know she is down on the ground and she is screaming,' the friend told the 911 operator, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

'It was a Siberian Lynx and it was attacking her and it cut her head open and she's bleeding a lot.'

When officers arrived in Buckhead, a posh suburb north of downtown Atlanta, the woman was bleeding heavily from her head. 

Hightower sustained claw injuries to her scalp and was taken to hospital. 

The animal's owner has a Georgia Department of Natural Resources wild animal breeding license and is in compliance with state law, according to Mark McKinnon from the agency's law enforcement division. 

The licensed owner, Fred Boyajian, has two serval cats, two caracal cats, one Canadian lynx, and four Siberian lynx, McKinnon said in an emailed statement.

Police investigated the attack and said the owner has a Georgia Department of Natural Resources wild animal breeding license and is in compliance with state law

Emergency: The female victim was taken to hospital with head injuries

Owner: Fred Boyajian has had a Georgia Department of Natural Resources wild animal breeding license for over 30 years. He breeds the cats as a hobby but also sells them

The lynx was returned to its cage and local animal control officials were notified, said Atlanta police spokesman Greg Lyon. 

The lynx's caretaker, David Laws, told 11 Alive that Hightower had gone 'against protocol' by entering the cage.

Laws said she was confused about the animal's feeding schedule and that the cat posed no threat to the community.

'On her own judgement, against protocol, she went into one of the cages for whatever reason,' he said.

Boyajian  has been licensed by the Georgia DNR to raise exotic cats for more than three decades.

Boyajian keeps the animals as a hobby but also sells them, mostly to zoos.

Past problem: In 2004, this smaller Siberian lynx escaped from its enclosure and was found roaming the neighborhood

Dangerous: Siberian lynx's - also known as a Eurasian lynx - are native to the forests of Siberia and typically prey on small to large mammals, from birds to moose and reindeer 

'They are not house pets,' Boyajian said on his personal website.

'Although they can be very loving, they can also inadvertently be destructive and dangerous. 

'We will not sell them to inexperienced owners, without permits, or for use as house pets.'

In 2004 another Siberian Lynx belonging to Boyajian escaped its enclosure and was found roaming the streets.

The cat, which weighed about 50 pounds, was caught and returned to its cage without incident.
