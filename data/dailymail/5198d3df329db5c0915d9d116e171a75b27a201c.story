With news of Steve Martin becoming a father at 67 and Hugh Grant at 52, it seems that you're never too old to have children.

But the ideal age to start to procreate, according to a recent study of British mothers and fathers, is just 26-years-old.

A third of parents claim that having 
children at a younger age meant they could have a bigger family, while a
fifth felt they will have more in common with their children.

Are they ready? Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Zac Efron are both 26, the perfect age for having a first child

A quarter of those questioned weren’t sure how long it would take to conceive, and so wanted to start early.

Owning a house and getting married were the two key milestones most parents wanted to have reached before having children.

Despite these milestones, six in 10 parents were happy to be earning a collective wage of just £25,000 a year before settling down to have a family.

Collective wage: Six in 10 parents were happy to be earning a collective wage of just £25,000 a year before settling down to have a family, Blake Lively and Ed Westwick are both 26 but earn a lot more than that

Claire Halsey, Clinical Psychologist and contributor to the Seven Seas Pregnancy whitepaper, who carried out the research, said: 'The results of this survey are quite surprising, as we would have expected parents to think the perfect age to start a family to be late twenties to early thirties, as opposed to mid-twenties.

'Contrary to popular belief younger women are planning a family after just a few years of working rather than waiting to establish a career, going travelling or spending time on hobbies.

'Perhaps there is a realisation that as the recession affects work prospects, planning for a family can come first and career later.'

Perfect age: Like Hilary Duff, most Brits think that 26 is the perfect age to have a child. Reasons include worrying that they won't be able to conceive when older

The report also questioned 2000 childless adults about their plans to have a family.

While one in 20 claimed they never wanted to have children, the average age across the rest of the respondents was 28.

So despite two thirds of people without children wanting to have achieved something in life before starting a family, most reckon they will have done this before hitting 30.

As well as wanting to have a house and marriage sorted, half of those polled wanted to earn a decent amount of money, while 47 per cent want job security.

Four in 10 people would like to have savings in the bank before settling down with kids and 26 per cent wanted to have enjoyed lots of holidays.

Older fathers: The average age for wanting children across childless respondents was 28, much younger than celebrity fathers Steve Martin who had a baby at 67 and Hugh Grant, 52

Childless couples also wanted to make a number of preparations before starting a family, but financial stability outweighs pre-conceptual health planning  – six in 10 wanted to save money for months in advance, while only a fifth would take folic acid, vitamins and supplements.

Despite government recommendations, 85 per cent of mothers and pregnant women didn’t take a conception supplement containing folic acid, omega-3 and vitamin D during their pregnancy.

Adopting a healthier attitude to life was a big concern – just under half of those polled on pregnancy wanted to eat healthier food, a quarter would take up more exercise and the same percentage would like to lose weight.

Of those mothers who have already had children, a fifth admitted they were initially worried that they weren’t healthy enough to start a family.

And of the six in 10 mums who planned their conception, one in 10 stopped smoking, and 23 per cent made healthier food choices and cut down on alcohol.
