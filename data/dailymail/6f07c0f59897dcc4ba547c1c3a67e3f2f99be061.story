Margaret Thatcher made repeated attempts to win a knighthood for Jimmy Savile  despite warnings about his ‘manner of life’.

The former prime minister made at least five requests for the now-disgraced DJ to be considered for the top honour, but senior civil servants voiced fears about his ‘strange and complex’ private life.

Previously unseen documents from the Cabinet Office reveal the extent of unease about the BBC presenter, almost three decades before he was finally unmasked as a predatory paedophile.

Misgivings...and the PM's retort. Civil servants were 'worried' while Mrs Thatcher felt press reports on Savile were no forgotten

There is no suggestion that Baroness Thatcher or her aides were aware of his vile abuse of children as young as eight.

But the official documents show that 
while BBC bosses were apparently willing to ignore the presenter’s 
private life, Whitehall mandarins privately voiced their misgivings 
about handing him a knighthood.

The files, made public under the 
Freedom of Information Act, show Mrs Thatcher wanted to bestow the 
honour to reward Savile’s charity work.

But her aides feared a scandal would 
engulf him and expressed fears he would ‘exploit’ a knighthood and taint
 the entire honours system.

Mrs Thatcher eventually succeeded in 
her quest and the DJ and Jim’ll Fix It presenter was made Sir Jimmy 
Savile in 1990, a month after she left Downing Street.

The Cabinet Office correspondence 
showed her requests on his behalf began at least seven years earlier in 
1983 – the year Savile boasted to journalists that he bedded women he 
met while running charity marathons.

Her request was vetoed by the honours
 committee, whose chairman Robert  Armstrong said it was too soon after 
Savile’s ‘unfortunate revelations’.

Mrs Thatcher repeated her request in 
October that year but Mr Armstrong, who was also her Cabinet Secretary, 
voiced ‘continued misgivings’.

The civil servant said: ‘We remain  
worried ... Fears have been expressed that Mr Savile might not be able 
to refrain from exploiting a knighthood in a way which brought the 
honours system into disrepute.’

Warnings: Lady Thatcher's aides were critical of Jimmy Savile's private life, but the Tory leader insisted his charity work meant he should become 'Sir'

Later requests were also refused, to Mrs Thatcher’s evident exasperation.

A letter from her private secretary 
Nigel Wicks in 1986 said: ‘She is most disappointed that Mr Savile’s 
name has not been recommended ... She wonders how many more times his 
name is to be pushed aside.’

The Government was spearheading a 
high-profile campaign to highlight the spread of Aids and Mr Armstrong 
said ‘sexual promiscuity’ like Savile’s should not be encouraged.

He wrote: ‘The case of Jimmy Savile is difficult. Mr Savile is a strange and complex man.

‘He deserves high praise for the lead he offers in giving quiet background help to the sick.

‘But he has made no attempt to deny the accounts in the press about his private life two or three years ago.’

Savile raised more than £30million 
for good causes, including £12million to rebuild the National Spinal 
Injuries Centre at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire, and he 
was given an OBE in 1971.

But misgivings about his private life
 meant civil servants continued to veto Mrs Thatcher’s requests for him 
to be given a higher award.

Mr Armstrong’s successor Robin Butler said the honours committee had rejected him for a knighthood again in 1987.

A constitutional bar preventing the dead 
from having their knighthoods removed means the government cannot strip Savile of the accolade

Those given a knighthood are awarded 
lifetime membership to a ‘living order’ and the title no longer exists 
when the holder dies.

The TV host, who died aged 84, was 
knighted in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list in 1990 - an award which 
followed the OBE he was given 
in 1971.

Whitehall sources admitted they considered awarding him a posthumous knighthood – so he could then be stripped of it.

The Queen has the power to remove honours after they have been recommended by the forfeiture committee.

Last year Fred Goodwin, former chief executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, was stripped of his knighthood.

He wrote: ‘My Committee and I still 
fear that his manner of life – on his own confession – has been such 
that a high award for him would be an unhelpful signal when we are still
 having to grapple with an Aids problem which threatens to intensify. A 
knighthood for him would not benefit the honours system in the eyes of 
the public.’

Previous government correspondence 
has revealed that Savile wrote to Mrs Thatcher in 1980 and she invited 
him to lunch at Chequers.

She subsequently spent 11 consecutive New Year’s Eves with him and oversaw his eventual knighthood in 1990.

It was only after his death in 2011, aged 84, that he was finally unmasked as a predatory paedophile with more than 450 victims.

His decades of child abuse prompted 
calls for the Honours Forfeiture Committee to revoke his knighthood, but
 officials claimed it was impossible as the honour formally ended when 
he died. The Cabinet Office originally refused the Freedom of 
Information request to release the secret files, made by The Sun 
newspaper last October.

But the Information Commissioner’s 
Office upheld an appeal, ruling there was ‘compelling public interest’ 
to release the files from the 1980s.

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: 
‘There is no indication in the papers that anything was known then about
 the allegations that have subsequently come to light about Jimmy 
Savile. The honours process was followed in accordance with the system 
at the time.’
