A stunning bracelet given to a Russian dancer by the King of Siam is set to go under the hammer for £8,000.

The ornate pure gold 2oz bracelet with an enamel picture of the Thai royal family was given to Nadia Yerusalimsky in around 1912 by the then King Vajiravudh - King Rama VI.

It is thought the dancer bewitched His Majesty when she performed at the palace after moving to Bangkok with her father who was a tailor.

King and I: The bracelet was a gift from King Rama VI, the grandson of the monarch who supposedly was the inspiration for the story, turned 1956 musical film, The King and I

King Rama VI was the grandson of King Rama IV, the monarch who was supposedly the inspiration for the story, turned 1956 musical film 'The King and I'.

The real-life story imitates the film, based on the 1944 novel Anna and the King of Siam by Margaret Landon, starring Yul Brynner as the king who falls for a Victorian governess played by Deborah Kerr.

But unlike the film, Ms Yerusalimsky went on to marry another man, Welshman Henry Hopkin in Bangkok in 1916.

Now their grandchildren are putting up the historic piece of jewellery for auction on November 1.

Bewitched by dancer: The King of Siam gave the bracelet to Nadia Yerusalimsky (left with unidentified dancer) in about 1912 after she performed at the palace in Bangkok

For sale: The pure gold 2oz bracelet, which features this enamel picture, is now going under the hammer as the dancer's grandchildren put it up for sale at auction on November 1

Auctioneer Thomas Plant, from Special Auction Services, Berkshire, said: ‘Although this has great value because it is almost completely pure gold, if not 99.9 percent, it's the history and romance behind it that is the real story.

‘King Rama VI was the grandson and the king who many think was the inspiration for the film and book the 'King and I'

‘And with this gift to Nadia it was in many ways a case of history repeating itself as it appears this king was very fond of her.

‘I don't think would have happened after the time of the Great War, this was a more innocent time.

Pure gold: The bracelet has seven gold bullet coins from the time of Rama V, King Chulalongkorn in the 1870s and is expected to fetch £8,000 at auction

‘Nadia actually went on to marry a rather naughty Welshman Henry Hopkin who had fled to Bangkok after having an affair with the village policeman's wife.

‘Henry, from Wales, and Nadia, from Russia, were married in Bangkok in 1916 and went on to have two children together.’

The bracelet features seven gold bullet coins from the time of Rama V , King Chulalongkorn, in the 1870s with two impressed strike marks, one for Chakra, the other possibly for Rama V, joined by oval links.

A circular medallion with enamel design for the Siamese Royal family is then joined to it by a later loop clasp.
