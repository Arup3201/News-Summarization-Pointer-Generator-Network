Its harrowing storyline about a missing child has captured an audience of eight million people.

And those viewers will be rejoicing today after the BBC confirmed its abduction thriller The Missing will return for a second series, with producers promising a ‘new case’.

The first series dramatically concluded last night on BBC1 as the mystery of who abducted five-year-old Oliver Hughes from a hotel bar in France during a family holiday in 2006 was finally solved.

James Nesbitt and Frances O’Connor starred in the first series as an English couple struggling to come to terms in the present day with their son’s abduction during the World Cup eight years ago.

And the BBC last night trailed a cryptic message suggesting a second storyline, with a short advert accompanied by a voiceover from detective Julien Baptiste, played by Tcheky Karyo.

He said: ‘To lose somebody can destroy a person. But to find them again, when so much has passed… Well, sometimes, that can be worse.’

The second series is expected to keep the show’s overall structure of a story set over two different time frames, but it will be a fresh case with different characters and a different location.

The writers behind the show, London-based brothers Harry and Jack Williams, said: ‘We always knew that the story of Oliver Hughes would have an ending.

‘But in writing the first series we found there were many themes and issues we didn’t have the chance to explore. The response to the show has been fantastic.

‘And we’re thrilled to be telling a brand new story which we hope will surprise and intrigue and tell an even bigger tale on an even more ambitious canvas.’

Charlotte Moore, controller of BBC One, said: ‘The Missing surprised at every turn, weaving a gripping and complex story across two timescales which kept viewers guessing until the very end and demonstrated the range and ambition of drama on BBC One.’

And Ben Stephenson, controller of BBC Drama, said: ‘Harry and Jack Williams’ original drama series has had the nation gripped for the last eight weeks and has proved both a critical and ratings hit with our BBC One audience. With a brand new and fresh case ahead - we can’t wait to learn what Harry and Jack have in store for series two.’

Star: Nesbitt had a leading role in the first series, which Daily Mail TV critic Christopher Stevens said has brought us 'the most baffling whodunnit of the year'

The show had a consolidated audience of nearly eight million including seven-day catch up viewing, reported The Guardian. The new series will consist of eight hour-long episodes.  

The show - which has received two Golden Globe nominations - will be produced by New Pictures with Two Brothers Pictures and Playground, and will also air on Starz in the US.

It has also been sold to networks in Australia, France, Denmark, Sweden and Canada.

(SPOILER ALERT) Last night’s finale of the first series, which Daily Mail TV critic Christopher Stevens said has brought us ‘the most baffling whodunnit of the year’, had a dramatic twist.

It turned out that Oliver was not abducted and had simply wandered off - into the path of a drunk driver, who hid the boy’s unconscious body in his car boot.

But instead of being taken to hospital, the boy was killed and his body dumped. The culprits were the drunkard, who ran the hotel where the Hughes family were staying, and his brother the Mayor.
