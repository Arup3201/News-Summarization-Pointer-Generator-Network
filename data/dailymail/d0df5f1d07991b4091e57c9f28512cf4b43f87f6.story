A woman who was so obese she struggled to stand upright has lost more than half her body weight to be crowned Rosemary Conley's Slimmer of the Year.

Liz Knight, who used to weigh 25st, 10lb and 
wear size 34 clothes, lost more than half her body weight to drop to a size 14
and a healthy 11st 4lb.

The 26-year-old from Preston, Lancashire, would start to the day with a double sausage and egg McMuffin, followed by a McDonald's meal for lunch, dinner at a friend's house before following it with a second supper cooked by her grandmother. 

In between, she snacked on cakes, 
biscuits, crisps, chocolates and cheese baguettes, leaving her, in her 
own words, 'a walking time bomb'.

Biggest loser: Liz Knight, 26, was morbidly obese before shedding more than half her body weight to become a healthy size 14. She is now retraining as an exercise-to-music instructor

Yummy mummy: Laura Mack's weight was preventing her from getting pregnant but now the svelte size 12 is now mother to two little boys aged two and three

But despite the difficulties caused by her large size, it wasn't until a friend challenged her to lose five stone that Knight decided to make a change.

Surpassing all expectations, including her own, she managed to lose a whopping 14st, 6lb.

Now a slim size 14, Knight's new goal is to become an exercise-to-music instructor in order to help other obese people shed the pounds.

But Knight isn't the only slimmer celebrating her success.

A young mother who shed half her body weight has been crowned 'Yummy Mummy Slimmer of the Year'.

Laura
Mack, once a weighty size 28, is now a svelte size 12, having shed 11st after being told that her excess pounds were stopping her from getting pregnant.

The 28-year-old is now a mother of 
two.

Also enjoying the benefits of a 
lighter life is nurse Charmaine White, 52, from Exeter, who lost 8st 7lb
after three decades of failed dieting and picked up the Over 50s 
Slimmer of the Year award.

White, who used to weigh 19st and
wear a size 26, said: 'Before I lost weight, I was self-conscious about
giving advice to my patients and wasn't a very good role model.'

She now wears a size 14 and weighs 10st,  7lb.

Couples who slim together... The Wanklyns from Tamworth pooled their willpower to achieve their goal

was holding her back from her dream of becoming a hairdresser.

Now a confident size 10/12, she is finally studying hairdressing at college.

Tamworth couple Diane and David Wanklyn took home the Mr and Mrs Slimmers of the Year after shedding 14st 12lb between them.

Mrs

their weight problem.
