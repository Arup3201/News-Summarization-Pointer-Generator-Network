Craig Hignett’s shock exit from Middlesbrough was triggered by a post-match fallout with manager Aitor Karanka, Sportsmail understands.

The Spanish boss was sent off by referee Mark Clattenburg in the wake of Blackburn’s controversial 95th-minute equaliser during Saturday's 1-1 draw at the Riverside Stadium and has since been charged with misconduct by the FA.

Karanka – who it is claimed pushed the fourth official during his protest - felt that assistant Hignett did not support him enough over the incident and words were exchanged.

What a difference a few days can make. On Saturday, Karanka and Hignett appeared on the BBC's Football Focus together and sang each other's praises... 

Hignett on Karanka: 'Aitor wanted someone who knew the club, who knew the fans, who knew the league, who could help him with things that perhaps he didn't know about.' 

Karanka on Hignett: 'When we played against Rotherham I didn't know the team, I didn't know the players. I didn't know a lot of things and he is the person who helps me with these kind of things. He helps with training sessions and he is very, very important for me.'

That led to Tuesday’s surprise news that the popular former Boro midfielder – who was not with Karanka and his backroom team at Sunday’s North East Football Writers’ Awards - would be leaving his position with immediate effect.

A club statement read: ‘Following discussions between Craig, head coach Aitor Karanka, and the club, all parties have agreed for Craig to leave his position with immediate effect.

‘The club would like to place on record its thanks for Craig’s efforts since joining us from Hartlepool last season and wish him all the best for the future.’

Karanka was furious that Clattenburg allowed Rudy Gestede’s last-gasp leveller to stand after what appeared a blatant foul on goalkeeper Dimi Konstantopoulos by Chris Brown.

Afterwards, the former Real Madrid defender said: ‘I don't know if I can say everything I am thinking I might have a problem (with the authorities).

‘The first thing I want to do is apologise for my behaviour because my behaviour has been bad and Middlesbrough Football Club doesn't deserve my behaviour, so I want to apologise, but I am going to fight for this club to the last second and put in 100 per cent myself every day.

‘But it was a moment that I was very frustrated because when you are working, when you are fighting for 93, 94 minutes and you have your objective in your hand. 

‘It's amazing, I can't believe my keeper is on the treatment table.

‘Someone asked me if I had seen the image (replay) and I said I watched the image but I didn't need to because Dimi is on the treatment table and I don't know if he is going to play in the next game.

‘The referee, two linesman, the fourth official - everybody in the stands and on the bench could watch the foul – except those four people, that's the interesting thing for me.’

The result left Boro two points off top in fifth place. Former favourite Juninho has been mentioned as one possible successor to Hignett.
