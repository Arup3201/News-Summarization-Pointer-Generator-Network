Barack Obama has revealed that when he leaves the White House in 2016, he wants to take over Sports Center.

He made a joke about the prospect during a meeting with Bob Iger, the chairman of Disney which owns ESPN, but the CEO apparently did not take the offer seriously.

Obama was in California touring the headquarters of DreamWorks Animation during the week before Thanksgiving when he went on a private tour of the facility and spoke with the company's top executives.

Talking to the right people: President Obama made the joke about joining the SportsCenter team while visiting DreamWorks headquarters in California on November 26

The Hollywood Reporter revealed that it was a wide-ranging conversation that touched on subjects like piracy and foreign policy before ending on a light-hearted note.

'At least I know what I want to do when I retire... host ESPN SportCenter's Top 10 List,' he said while facing Mr Iger.

Joke's on you: Disney chairman Bob Iger reportedly laughed at the suggestion

Sources in the room during the closed meeting said 'everyone had a good giggle' including Mr Iger, but aside from the laugh, he is not believed to have made any other remarks about the issue.

It wasn't the only time he had the crowd laughing during that California trip as he went on to kid that his ears were the inspiration for that of one of DreamWorks' best-known characters: Shrek.

The President's love of sports is well-known but he has largely kept his opinions neutral- with exceptions being made for his hometown Chicago teams.

The prospect of trading the Resolute Desk for a desk on the SportsCenter set would certainly help the President de-stress after two terms in office, but he has been able to keep up with the NBA while in office.

He regularly takes in basketball games at Washington's Verizon Center and was seated in the front row alongside his wife and daughters when Oregon State University played the University of Maryland on November 17. (Michelle's brother Craig Robinson is the head coach of Oregon's team.)

Should the joke of a retirement plan come to fruition, it won't be the first time that he tries out such a gig.

In January 2010, President Obama joined the CBS commentators during the third quarter of the Georgetown-Duke face off.

During that appearance, he told CBS' Clark Kellogg that he'd better watch out because he'll be vying to take over.

'After retirement Iâ€™m coming after your job, Clark, just letting you know. You either have three more years or seven- I'm not sure which but you need to plan accordingly,' the President said during his first year in office.

'I'm going to do some play by play.'
