The recording of the song was broadcast on Israel National News and shows the children singing a song called 'Cry No More'.

It features the voices of Yakob, 5, Moshe, 8, Yeshua, 10, and David, 12, Sarah, 6, Rivkah, 11, and Elian, 15 as well as Tzipara, who survived the blaze.

The song was made popular by Orthodox Jewish singer Yaakov Shwekey and is about the tragedy of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Hauntingly, the lyrics detail various tragedy and ends with a rejoicing in the coming of Redemption.

The children were buried in Jerusalem on Monday, where hundreds of mourners turned out to attend their funeral 

The children's father, Gabriel, paid a moving tribute to his children saying they were 'seven innocent lambs' 

At one point the children are heard singing: 'Many brokenhearted, friends lost and departed. Please, no more.'

The song Cry No More was originally recorded by Orthodox Jewish singer Yaakov Shwekey.

It was released in 2012 and became a major hit within the Jewish community.

The song details the struggle for peace in the Middle East and ends with the hope in the coming of Redemption.

Among the lyrics are the words: 'Many tears have fallen, many years we’re calling, please no more.

'Many broken-hearted, friends lost and departed, please no more.

'Now the time has come, everyone must stand together, and be strong forever more.'

In the recording the older children can be heard singing at the top of their voices, with the younger siblings also eager to join in.

According to the New York Post, the family are yet to commit the recording  to a CD because it was made so soon before the fire.

Today Mr Sassoon is expected to return to New York following the children's funerals.

On Sunday, the devastated father and hundreds of mourners attended a memorial for the children at Shomrei Hadas Chapel in Borough Park before a procession of hearses led their coffins to New York's JFK airport where they were boarded onto a flight bound for Israel.

His wife Gayle and daughter Tzipora were the only two in his family to survive the blaze, after jumping from the second floor. They both remain in hospital.

Mr Sassoon was away from the home at a religious retreat in Manhattan at the time of the fire. 

He said: 'My wife gave her soul to our children every day, until their last day. 

'They were such innocent children. I didn't know there could be such tears. Seven roses, so beautiful and pure.'

A fire ripped through the Sassoon family home in Brooklyn in the early hours of Saturday morning

The blaze was sparked by a malfunctioning hot plate left on to keep food warm during the Sabbath

The New York Fire Department said it was the most devastating blaze seen by the city in seven years and confirmed a smoke detector was found in the basement but that there were none others throughout the home.

Firefighters received a call at 12.23am about the blaze at a single-family home in Midwood, a section of Brooklyn known for its low crime and large Orthodox Jewish population. More than 100 firefighters responded and brought the blaze under control at around 1.30am.

Investigators said the fire started in the kitchen, when a hot plate that was left on caught fire.

The hot plate was left on for the Sabbath, which lasts from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday.

The Sassoons' hot plate apparently malfunctioned, setting off flames that tore up the stairs, trapping the children in their second-floor bedrooms as they slept, investigators added.
