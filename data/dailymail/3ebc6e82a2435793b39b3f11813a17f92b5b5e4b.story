The ‘bad’ type of cholesterol – which causes heart disease – is linked to Alzheimer’s, researchers have found.

Such cholesterol has previously been associated with a narrowing of the arteries.

Now a study has revealed that the bad type is related to the amyloid peptide protein in the brain, which is present in Alzheimer’s.

A study has revealed that the bad type of cholesterol - which causes heart disease - is related to the amyloid peptide protein (pictured) in the brain, which is present in Alzheimer's

In patients affected by disease, clumps of the protein stick to brain cells, affecting memory, mood and behaviour.

The discovery may explain the well-known link between raised cholesterol and an increased risk of Alzheimer’s.

Researchers found the link depended on whether people had more good cholesterol, known as high density lipoprotein (HDL), or the bad form called low density lipoprotein (LDL). 

High levels of LDL can lead to narrowed arteries and heart disease, whereas HDL is protective.

The new US research suggests the two kinds of cholesterol have the same effect on the brain as on the heart.

Study leader professor Bruce Reed, from the University of California at Davis, said: ‘Unhealthy patterns of cholesterol could be directly causing the higher levels of amyloid known to contribute to Alzheimer’s, in the same way that such patterns promote heart disease.’

The scientists looked at 74 men and women aged 70 and over. All had brain scans using a tracer chemical that binds with amyloid plaques in order to highlight them on the images.

Higher fasting levels of LDL and lower levels of HDL were both associated with more amyloid in the brain, according to the findings published online in the journal JAMA Neurology.

Professor Reed said: ‘This study provides a reason to certainly continue cholesterol treatment in people who are developing memory loss, regardless of concerns regarding their cardiovascular health.’

Fellow author Dr Charles DeCarli said the discovery was a ‘wake-up call’ for those with a poor cholesterol balance.

Dr Laura Phipps, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘The findings add to existing evidence that cholesterol could play a role in the Alzheimer’s disease process.

‘The best way to keep our brain healthy is to eat a balanced diet, maintain a healthy weight, not smoke, exercise regularly  and keep blood pressure and cholesterol  in check.’
