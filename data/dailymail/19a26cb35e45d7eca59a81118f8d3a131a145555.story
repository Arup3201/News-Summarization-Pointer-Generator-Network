'My 8-year old daughter Maddie is a big 
Chicago Bears fan. Oops! I guess NFL Shop must have messed up or 
something and sent her the wrong jersey ;),' reads the video 
description.

At first, Maddie is all smiles. She voraciously eyes a box wrapped up in holiday paper. She grimaces a bit as she uses all her might to tear open the box.

She pulls out the jersey, gives it one disgusted look, then throws it directly at her father who is holding a camera to witness her reaction.

As if throwing the jersey were no enough, Maddie then Kicks the jersey on the floor and walks over to her mother angrily, with her arms crossed.

She is overcome by tears as she crawls into her her mother's arms. When asked if she likes the jersey, she turns to her father and yells, 'It sucks!' and makes an angry hand motion (not quite the middle finger) towards her father.

Her somewhat amused yet sympathetic dad says, 'go bears.'
