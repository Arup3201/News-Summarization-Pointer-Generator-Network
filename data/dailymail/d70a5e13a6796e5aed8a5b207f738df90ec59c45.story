Marie Curie, Florence Nightingale and Margaret Thatcher have been named as the top three women who have 'changed the world'.

The definitive list, which also includes campaigners, royals and authors, was compiled following a poll of 2,000 British adults.

Also included were fashion pioneer Coco Chanel, Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling and iconic sex symbol Marilyn Monroe.

Pioneer: Marie Curie's work in chemistry made her the first woman ever to win a Nobel Prize, which she then went on to win again before dying of radiation poisoning in 1934 at the age of 66

Powerful women: The founder of modern nursing Florence Nightingale (left) and Britain's only ever female Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (right) came second and third in the list respectively 

Curie, who died from radiation exposure in 1934 at the age of 66, came top.

Her pioneering work in chemistry made her the first woman ever to win a Nobel Prize, which she then went on to win again.

Hailed as the founder of modern nursing, 'Lady of the Lamp' Florence Nightingale, who passed away in 1910 aged 90, came second.

Britain's first and only female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who died in April 2013 aged 87, rounded off the top three.

The 'Iron Lady' led the Conservative party for 15 years and was known for her uncompromising approach to politics.

Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst was voted fourth place and the revered Mother Teresa came fifth. 

British royals featured highly with Princess Diana (sixth place) receiving more votes than long-serving monarchs Queen Victoria (seventh), Queen Elizabeth I (10th) and Queen Elizabeth II (12th).

The Duchess of Cambridge also made the top 40 featuring in 36th place.

Way with words: Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling (left) got generations of children reading, while Anne Frank's (right) diary of her time hiding from the Nazi made the horror of the Holocaust real for millions

Influential: TV host and the first black woman billionaire ever Oprah Winfrey is 26th on the list

The writing of Anne Frank gave a moving commentary on the war through one little girl's diary until her tragic death in 1945 and sees her placed inside the top 10.

When quizzed on the common characteristics of the women in the list, the fact that so many were unafraid to challenge the beliefs of their time was the thing admired most.

Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat on a bus launched a revolution in human civil rights in 1955 featured in 11th, while former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi came 13th.

The adventurer Amelia Earhart flies in at 14th, while Harry Potter scribe J.K. Rowling also appears inside the top 20, as do Marilyn Monroe and Jane Austen.

Media mogul Oprah Winfrey's power is clearly recognised and sees her appear among the women who changed the world, alongside Hillary Clinton and youngest ever Nobel prize recipient, Malala Yousafzai.

However, only a third of those polled felt there were enough inspirational figures for today's younger generation.

In fact, a resounding eight in ten felt young women idolise modern celebrities far too much.

The research was commissioned to mark the return of Sky Arts' hit comedy series Psychobitches, the satirical show which playfully delves into the minds of some of history's most influential and iconic women.

A spokeswoman for Sky Arts said: 'There's no doubt that the women on this list changed the world and continue to inspire people today.

'These characters - and all the women in the series - offer us a light-hearted look at what these incredible women might have confessed on the psychiatrist's couch, given the chance.'
