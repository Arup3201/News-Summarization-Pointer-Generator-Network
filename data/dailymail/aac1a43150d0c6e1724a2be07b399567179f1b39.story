It's the worldwide hit that's spawned a thousand impersonators, some impressive, some downright shocking.

And it is probably fair to say Channel 4 news reader Cathy Newman's attempt at taking off Gangnam Style falls firmly in the latter category.

The presenter broke into the worst type of dad-style dance to the smash hit during an online segment called 'What 2012 has taught me'.

At that, the distinctive beat kicks in and Mrs Newman's awkward-looking, shuffling danceÂ  - and vocals - begins in her re-named version of the song, 'This is C4-style'.

Struggling to sing and dance in time with the music, Ms Newman lurches from side-to-side as she tries to replicate Psy's horse-riding-style, seemingly struggling to move freely in her high heels as she belts out the words, 'Heeeeyyy, sexy newsroom'.

Since being
released in June by South Korean act Psy, the hit has gone viral on the
internet and reached Number 1 in more than 30 countries.

It has been viewed more than 1bn times on YouTube, surpassing the site's previous record with Justin Bieber's 'Baby'.

Gangnam refers to a district of Seoul in South Korea.

Mercifully, the performance only lasts a few seconds before a slightly out of breath Ms Newman admits defeat, blaming her dancing on her shoes and urging viewers not to try it with similar footwear.

Writing on her Twitter feed later, the presenter seemed red-faced, saying: "Good idea at the time but having watched it back it's the most embarrassing thing I've done since losing teenage drinking game #gangnam."

She later wrote: "Thanks all #gangnam tribute tweets. Think the consensus is don't give up the day job...so I won't!"

Despite her fears, some viewers praised her effort, with @_jordanJBryan writing that 'it was absolute gold and possibly better than the original', while @MargoJMilne said '"Hey sexy newsroom" is genius'.

The popularity of the original song seems to know no bounds.

By the end of October 2012, the it had topped the music charts in countries including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom.
