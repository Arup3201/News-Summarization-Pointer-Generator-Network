It's undoubtedly the hottest ticket in 
town and only a selection of fashion's finest VIP guests will get to grace the front row
 at today's Burberry Prorsum show.

But
 that doesn't mean you have to miss out on seeing the latest styles from
 the luxury British brand (or close ups of rumoured guest Harry Styles) as FEMAIL will show the action live from 
the catwalk.

The live stream of the AW14 collection will be available to watch below and on the MailOnline Femail channel as it unfolds at 2pm direct from Kensington Gardens.

Famous faces rumoured to be attending include Harry Styles, Suki Waterhouse, Bradley Cooper and Daisy Lowe and Burberry stalwarts likely to be walking include Jourdan Dunn, Karlie Kloss and Cara Delevingne.

As for the fashion Burberry's
 chief creative officer Christopher Bailey is famed for his ability to 
reinvent trends whilst still staying true to their 
more-than-a-century-old heritage.

Last
 season he gave us a feminine, 
genteel collection – he described it as ‘tender’ - replete with 
Victorian lace in soft macarón hues of mint and rose, mauve and 
lavender, gentle shapes that borrowed just enough from the archives, the
 occasional graphic print in black and white or a splash of red, and more than a sprinkling of bling.

Burberry are even offering fashion fans the chance to order items straight from the runway - perhaps it's best to hide those credit cards now, ladies.

Burberry was founded in 1856 but has
 moved with the times under Bailey. Their flagship Regent Street store 
in London is not just a place to shop but a hub of new technology with interactive mirrors, concert-quality sound systems and giant screens streaming their catwalk shows.

Speaking
 to the MailOnline, Bailey said it's all about 
involving people around the world and making them feel part of the 
experience - even if they can't be there in person.

He
 said: 'It's about doing something that makes people smile, that makes 
people want to engage, whether it's online, whether it's physical, 
whether it's at the show like this.'
