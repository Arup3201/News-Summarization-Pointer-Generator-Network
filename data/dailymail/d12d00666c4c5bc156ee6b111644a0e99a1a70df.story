The chilling text messages a young father sent to his ex before allegedly murdering their two young children were revealed in court on Friday.

Gabriel Armandariz, 32, of Graham, Texas, is accused of strangling his two sons, Gatlin, 2, and Luke, who was just 8-months-old in April 2011.

This shortly after he sent a string of chilling and odd text messages to their mother telling her he planned to kill the boys because of her partying ways while possibly pretending to be his new girlfriend. 

Gabriel Armandariz reportedly sent text messages threatening to kill his two sons to the boys' mother Karen Smith (above) shortly before strangling them

Gatlin, 2, and Luke, who was just 8-months-old (above), were found dead in a crawl space in April 2011

In one text massage Armandariz wrote, 'I commend the spirits of these two boys to the Lord. I would much rather be with them than to be out partying with friends'

'I commend the spirits of these two boys to the Lord. I would much rather be with them than to be out partying with friends,' wrote Armandariz to his ex, Lauren Smith, just hours before the boys are believed to have died.

This was quickly followed by another in which he wrote; 'Look, I’m trying to offer you another opportunity to see our children. But as usual you would much rather be with your friends.'

According to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, prosecutors in the case argued that Smith was not even aware the texts were coming from Armandariz, and actually believed they were coming from the woman he was dating at the time.

This seems to be backed up by the woman's responses to these texts, as she wrote in one; 'If I were you I’d get the hell away from him. Looks can be deceiving.'

On the day the boys died, Armandariz also sent a photo to Smith that appeared to show Luke dead and dangling from the closet with rope around his neck. 

This was followed by the final text, which also showed both boys alive and lying next to him, and read; 'We love u, goodbye.' 

Armandiriz also reportedly sent a photo to Smith of Luke dead and hanging from the ceiling of the closet with a rope around his neck

Armadiriz later told a 911 operator that his girlfriend made him strangle the boys

Earlier in the week, Lt. James Reeves revealed that after seeing the picture of Lukje hanging from the closet, police rushed to Armandariz's home hoping to save Gatlin.

'We were operating on the belief that Luke was dead,' Reeves said. 

'We didn’t know about the older son.'

That is when they found a tarp in the crawl space under the home. 

'We saw four little feet inside the tarp,' Lt. Reeves said. 

'One of the feet had a shoe on it. It was a little camel tennis shoe and that’s how we knew. We never laid eyes on the bodies other than to see those feet.'

Prosecutors claim that Armandariz strangled both boys with handle of a cloth grocery back before putting their bodies in a pillowcase that he then wrapped in a tarp and shoved into the crawl space.

Armandariz's bizarre 911 call shortly after he killed the boys was also played for the jury this week, in which he told the operator; 'My girlfriend asked me to kill my babies. What was I supposed to do? My girlfriend told me to kill both of them. What was I supposed to do? I hate her, I hate her, I hate her so much. I’m so scared now.'

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in the case,
