Fuelling a motor passion, former soldier Nick Priest has built Britain's biggest mobility scooter - with the power of SIX small Ford Fiestas.

His motor trike - nicknamed Grunt - is 11 feet long and boasts a 7.2 litre engine from a V8 Dodge Charger, the car made famous by the Dukes of Hazzard TV series.

The 54-year-old former soldier spent seven years assembling it from old car and motorbike parts.

Disabled biker Nick Priest has built Britain's biggest mobility scooter, with as much power as six small cars

Nick, of Penryn, Cornwall, was a radio operator in the British Army before becoming a technical illustrator for Haynes motor manual.

Five years ago, he had to give up work because he suffers from fibromyalgia syndrome, a condition which causes debilitating pain and extreme tiredness.

But he's fired up by his love of cars and satisfies his passion by designing and adapting motorbikes for disabled people.

'I have mobility issues,' said Nick. 'I also get chronic fatigue. It's like somebody has switched off the power. Sometimes I haven't got the energy to even stand up.

'And I get terrible pain. Once it felt like I had broken my shoulder. My shoulder wasn't broken, but the brain told me it was. I also get muscle spasms – the shakes.

'On a bad day I'm rocking in pain and I just can't get up. It just comes and goes.'

Former soldier Nick is currently making another vehicle for a friend whose false leg can't reach the pedals

Some days Nick says he has to use a walking stick but he gets comfort from working with metal.

He is currently working on adapting a motor trike for a friend who has one leg.

'I can make anything out of metal,' he said. 'I really enjoy it. I'm adapting this different trike as a favour for my friend who can't reach the pedals with his false leg.'

Since serving in Ireland and Germany as a radio control sector commander – full corporal – with the 2nd Armoured Division – he has also designed and built petrol go-karts for children and all-terrain vehicles.

In June he hopes to ride to Scotland to raise money for the National Association of Bikers with Disabilities (NABD), which provides training and grants advice to disabled riders to get them back on their bikes.

Through NABD's network of national bike clubs and local radio stations, he plans to raise funds through donation and by selling passenger rides on his trike.

'I plan to do 50 miles per day,' he said. 'As long as I don't overdo it and take my medication I should be fine.'

Nick will drive his vehicle from Land's End to John O'Groats.

The General Lee is the Dodge Charger driven by the Duke cousins Bo and Luke in the television series The Dukes of Hazzard.

It is known for its signature horn, its chases and stunts - especially its long and high jumps - and for having its doors welded shut, leaving the Dukes to climb in and out through the windows. The car appeared in every episode but one.
