A man who threw a glass at X Factor judge Redfoo during a night out has pleaded guilty to assault.

When Arian Berisha, 21, entered his plea at the Downing Centre Local Court, in Sydney, on Tuesday the more serious charge of reckless wounding was dropped.

Redfoo - whose real name is Stefan Gordy - was hit by the glass as he left a VIP section at the popular pub The Golden Sheaf Hotel, in Sydney’s Double Bay, on August 28.

The big-haired American singer suffered a cut above his right eye and was treated by paramedics.

Berisha, from Waverley in Sydney's eastern suburbs, appeared briefly in court.

He will be sentenced at the same court on May 26.

Lawyers for Mr Berisha told the court in September the only information they had on the case came from Twitter, and that they were 'seeking statements of more than 140 characters.'

At the time of the incident, the X Factor judge said he was dancing with some girls in the roped-off VIP section of the pub when a 'dodgy' guy threw a glass, cutting him on the head.

'It was shocking to me, when something like that happens,' Redfoo told Daily Mail Australia following the incident.

'There was quite a bit of blood.

'My hand was all bloody, I looked in the mirror, the whole side of my face had blood on it.'

His alleged attacker - who Redfoo labelled a 'real glasshole' in one interview - attempted to flee the scene.

The injured star sprinted after him but was restrained by security guards and one of his friends.

Redfoo said: 'I have no clue on why you could do such a thing, I can only think of the word jealousy.'

'It's one of the big questions I have. Why, why would he do that? Why would somebody throw a glass at somebody?'

The singer was treated for a small, centimetre-wide cut on the right side of his head and delivered a statement to police.

Redfoo has never been attacked before. It was the first time he had visited the Sydney hotel and he said if he returns he would wear a Ducati motorcycle helmet.

'They gotta' get rid of the glass cups, the glass bottles,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It's just unnecessary in the club and it's very dangerous.'

'I don't do shows unless there's everything plastic in the clubs and the shows.

Redfoo was  in Australia acting as a judge on the popular reality TV show X-Factor

'It's something that now I will have to check before I go out anywhere. "What is their policy on glass"?'

The managers of the Golden Sheaf Hotel said in a statement they were 'appalled' by the attack and was assisting authorities with their investigations.

'This behaviour is not tolerated,' they said. 'We are in discussions with Redfoo and his management and we’re glad that he is ok.'

The injured singer was quick to respond to the incident on Twitter at the time, writing at 1.42am: 'Jealousy is a hell of a drug!'.

In an interview with Triple M, pubgoer Josh Allerton recalled the chaotic scenes.

'(Redfoo) went down in pain, all of a sudden it just unfolds.'

'He starts sprinting after the guy who gets caught by security... Blood starts coming from his head and we realised it was a bottle being thrown.'

Golden Sheaf customer Erik Bonetti also recounted the dramatic events on Twitter. 'Just saw @RedFoo getting taken out of the Golden Sheaf bleeding from the head,' he tweeted.

'What the hell just happened?'

Redfoo is the son off Berry Gordy, Jr, founder of the Motown record label, and writer-producer Nancy Leiviska.

He attended highschool with The Voice judge and Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am. The pair have been best friends for more than 20-years.

Redfoo first found fame as one half of electro-pop duo LMFAO, which founded with his nephew Sky Blu in 2006.

The pair found success with hits I'm In Miami B***h, Party Rock Anthem and Sexy And I Know It.

LMFAO worked with some of the biggest names in the business, appearing on tracks for Madonna, Black Eyed Peas, Justin Bieber, Pitbull and Nicki Minaj.

The band announced in late 2012 that they were going on hiatus - not breaking up - so they could focus on their solo careers.

Redfoo, who now spends four to five months of the year in Australia, has released several solo singles recently, including Bring Out The Bottles, Let's Get Ridiculous and New Thang.
