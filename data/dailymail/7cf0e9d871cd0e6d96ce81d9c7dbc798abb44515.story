This is the shocking moment an SUV plowed through a donut shop in Los Angeles - killing a man and leaving four others 'critically injured'

The vehicle was caught on surveillance cameras crashing into Jolly Donuts at the intersection of De Soto Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard in Canoga Park shortly before 10pm yesterday.

Footage shows the silver car driving into the front of the store, before smashing into a glass case containing donuts, sending it flying through the air. 

It can then be seen speeding through the shop's interior - hitting customer Bruce Bowman, who was sitting at a table - and exiting out of its side windows.

Although the victim killed in the crash is yet to be identified by police, the shop's owner, Sivlai Chung, described him as 'a regular'.

'He comes to the shop every night to charge his phone cause he’s homeless,' said. 

'He has a cup of coffee and he sits there until his phone’s charged up and he leaves on his way.' 

Last night, witnesses reported seeing the SUV speed through the parking lot, before smashing into the front of the busy store, causing glass and debris to fly on to the street.

Injured: The driver of the SUV is thought to be a young woman. Above, a crash victim is taken to hospital

One witness told KTLA 5 News they had seen bodies lying on the floor of the shop, with one man heard 'moaning and groaning' as they waited for emergency crews. 

The driver, who has also been transported to hospital, is thought to be a young woman. She will now be evaluated by police and medics to determine whether alcohol was involved.

Police Sargent William Kelly told the Los Angeles Times it has not yet been determined how many of the injured victims were inside the donut shop when the SUV struck

He added that there was no further information available at this time.
