Victim: Ruth Christopher died after she was involved in an accident with a Domino's delivery driver

A jury has awarded $32 million to the family of a Southeast Texas couple involved in a deadly crash with a Domino’s Pizza delivery driver.

The Jefferson County jury concluded the Ann Arbor, Michigan-based chain was partially responsible for the death of 65-year-old Ruth Christopher.

A Domino’s delivery driver lost control of his car while delivering a pizza in Beaumont in 2012 and hit a vehicle carrying Ruth and and her husband Devavaram Christopher.

Ruth Christopher died the next day; her husband, now 70, was injured severely.

The accident was blamed on defective, worn tires on the delivery vehicle. The driver was also cited for speeding.

Jurors concluded on Tuesday that Domino’s was partly responsible by not enforcing a policy that drivers' vehicles be inspected.

A Domino’s spokesman says the company plans to appeal.

Tim McIntyre, vice president of communications for the Ann Arbor-based Domino's, said the company offered its condolences for the 'terrible accident'.

But he said it was difficult to comprehend 'that a corporation is responsible for whether an independent franchise employee is driving on bald tires'.

'The employee in question did not work for us; he worked for an established independent franchise operation.

'Franchisors do not control the day-to-day operations of franchisees, especially to that minute level of detail. We are saddened by this tragedy, but do intend to appeal the decision.'
