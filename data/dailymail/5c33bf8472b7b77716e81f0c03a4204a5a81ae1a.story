Doctors forced a heavily pregnant woman to walk five miles home in the rain - just hours before she gave birth on her bathroom floor.

Katie Baker, 19, was rushed to hospital on Sunday after showing signs of going into labour - four days before her due date.

She waited eight hours before a bed became available but, after being examined by doctors, she was discharged the following day.

Without her bank card to pay for a taxi and no one to collect her, Miss Baker was forced to hike the five-mile journey home along a busy dual carriageway

Without her bank card to pay for a taxi and no one to collect her, Miss Baker was forced to hike the five-mile journey home along a busy dual carriageway.

It took her two hours to walk from Walsall Manor hospital to her home in Tipton, West Midlands on Monday afternoon.

She was so exhausted that Miss Baker, who was due to give birth tomorrow, was forced to take a break at a library before continuing her painful journey.

But just three hours later, she went into labour on the toilet but there was not enough time to take her back to hospital.

Her partner Clint Jones, 25, dialled 999 and paramedics were forced to deliver daughter Kelsey Jones, weighing 7lb 6oz, on her bathroom floor.

Miss Baker, who has another daughter, one-year-old Demi-Leigh, today blasted the hospital’s maternity unit for failing to listen to her.

She said: 'I’ve already had a child before so I knew that it was going to come soon but they still discharged me.

'I said, "the only way I can get home is walking and that’s all the way in Tipton".

'They said, "you still have to be discharged".

'I rang my mum but she lives over 60 miles away in Banbury, Oxfordshire, but she didn’t have her car with her.

'I had left my bank card at home so had no money and me and Clint were forced to walk home.

'We told the doctors and nurses we had no transport but they shrugged their shoulders and said we had to go.

'It was really exhausting because I had my overnight bag with me and it was cold and starting to rain.

'I had to stop a few times to get my breath back and was so out of puff I had to sit down in a library half way home before carrying on.

'When we finally got home, I had 
pains in my stomach so I had a warm bath and then an hour later I went 
on the toilet when the baby’s head popped out.

'We rang 999 and the ambulance rushed round but there was no time to take me back to hospital so I gave birth on the bathroom floor.'

The couple got a lift to hospital on the Sunday from a friend but her car was not available the following day.

Miss Baker was taken back to hospital by paramedics after the birth as the baby had turned blue from swallowing amniotic fluid.

After staying in for two nights, she finally returned home with her healthy baby girl.

The family are now demanding an apology from the hospital.

Full-time mother Miss Baker added: 'Nobody listened to me. What sort of a country do we live in when doctors force a woman who is nine months pregnant to walk home in the wet and cold?

'I’m furious because the doctors put my baby at risk, I could have gone into labour on the path on the way home with cars whizzing by.'

Mr Jones, a factory worker, said: 'It was awful, there were spots of rain, it was cold and windy and we had to walk along a busy dual carriageway.

'I couldn’t believe it when we were told to walk home.  It’s a disgraceful way to treat a heavily pregnant woman.'

An NHS spokesperson said it was 'carrying out a full investigation'.

Karen Palmer, head of midwifery at Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, said: 'I am saddened to hear about this patient’s experience in our maternity department.

'The trust is carrying out a full investigation into the concerns that have been raised on behalf of the patient and we will be happy to speak with the patient directly to try to address these.'

The scandal comes days after 11 medics were suspended after a man collapsed and died on the doorstep of Walsall Manor Hospital.
