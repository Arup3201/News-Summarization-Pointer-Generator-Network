Scores of firefighters have been tackling a blaze following an explosion at a primary school in Weybridge today.

Eight fire engines and more than 40 crew members are currently at the scene where flames and a huge plume of black smoke can be seen rising into the air.

The explosion and resulting fire happened on the construction site of a new development at the £12,000-a-year St George's College Junior School, where children's ages range from 3 to 11.

Plumes of smoke: Scores of firefighters have been tackling a fire in Weybridge following an explosion next to a primary school

Residents living nearby described hearing 'very nasty bangs' followed by a 'really nasty smell'. All of the school's pupils are accounted for, say police.

The fire is believed to have broken out on the roof of an 'environmentally friendly' development in the school's grounds which is set to house new classrooms, an assembly hall and an IT suite. 

Speaking to The Surrey Comet, local Councillor Andrew Davis said: 'There is a plume of black smoke and the firefighters are dousing it now. The school has been evacuated.

'At this stage, there is a lot of smoke in the neighbourhood. I think the new building has a flat roof. The main thing is, I trust, none of the workers were put in danger.

'It is mayhem here – all the roads are blocked. The emergency tape is keeping people quite a long way back.'

Dozens of people in the surrounding area watched and took pictures as emergency services arrived to tackle the blaze.

Reaction: A number of people on Twitter have said that the fire was caused by an exploding gas cylinder

'I didn't see any emergency services at that point but did see children being evacuated and holding hands with adults who looked calm, but there were a few people panicking - it was awful, terrifying.

'The whole area is just covered with a smog. It smells like some kind of cable fire, not a bonfire, but like chemicals - it is just horrible.'

A number of other witnesses took to Twitter to describe the dramatic scenes in Surrey today with many expressing concern over the safety of the local school's children.

One Twitter user suggested there had been a gas explosion.

Miranda Schunke, wrote: 'Weybridge school explosion - gas cylinder exploded after insulation caught fire - unconfirmed.' 

Work began on the new development, believed to be the building on fire, in July 2014.

On the St George's Junior School website it states: 'The new facility has been designed to be very environmentally friendly with energy efficiency and sustainability in mind and will include low energy lighting, extra insulation and materials sourced from sustainable forests'.

A statement released by the school today read: 'St George's Weybridge can confirm that a fire took place on the roof of a building under construction at St George's Junior School in Weybridge late this morning (Friday 13 March 2015).

Headmaster Anthony Hudson said: 'While this has come as a great shock, I am very relieved that not a single person was hurt'

'The building is in a separate compound under the control of our building contractor and no school personnel or children were in the vicinity.

'Everyone within the School was evacuated quickly, the emergency services are attending and it can be confirmed that there are no injuries to pupils, staff, visitors or building workers.

'The emergency services and School have allowed children back into class this afternoon and school is continuing normally, whilst allowing parents to collect their children early should they so wish.

'The Headmaster, Mr Antony Hudson, took the normal Friday assembly soon afterwards for all the older children. The Chief Fire Officer was able to explain to them that fires like this are extremely rare and that he was very impressed by the manner in which they conducted themselves very safely.'
