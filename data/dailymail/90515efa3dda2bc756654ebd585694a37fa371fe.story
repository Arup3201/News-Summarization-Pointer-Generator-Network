This is the shocking moment three masked men forced their way into a supermarket and threatened staff with knives and swords.

The trio burst into the Co-op store in Wollaton, Nottingham, as staff cashed up for the day shortly before midnight.

Grabbing one woman by the hair, they held a sword inches from her face and emptied her bag.

They then bundled them into a store room, repeatedly assaulting them, before making off with their phones.

Nottinghamshire Police have now released CCTV footage which shows the three men - who are all wearing black - during their sinister attack.

The 2.21-minute clip shows the thugs rushing in armed with the enormous blades at 11.30pm on June 16.

It culminates in them fleeing the main room to find the store's safe.

Appeal: Police have launched an appeal to find the men, describing the incident as an 'ill-planned robbery'

Terrified: Staff were left traumatised but escaped without severe injuries from the sinister attack

Aggressive: Nottinghamshire Police urged people to contact them if they recognise the thugs' mannerisms

Detective Constable Jim Bravant, from 
Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'This was an ill-planned robbery where 
staff were subjected to a very aggressive assault.

'The
 last thing these workers should expect in their jobs, serving members 
of the public, is the fear of violence or to be involved in a 
frightening robbery.'

'If 
you know anything about this robbery, recognise the offenders, or even 
their mannerisms, please get in touch with us or Crimestoppers in 
confidence. Donâ€™t let them do it again.'

The staff members were left extremely distressed by the ordeal but not seriously injured.

Crime scene: The robbery happened at the Co-op in Wollaton, Nottingham after the raiders gained access via the rear garden of a nearby pub

All three men were dressed head to toe in black clothing with their hoods pulled up.

Police described one of the gang as mixed race with brown eyes and said he was of medium build and stood at about 5ft 10ins tall.

Another man was chubbier than the third and the first chubbier still. The thief was carrying a distinctive Nike rucksack on his back and his black jacket also had white patches above the pockets.

Officers believe the offenders gained access to the shop via the rear garden of a nearby pub.
