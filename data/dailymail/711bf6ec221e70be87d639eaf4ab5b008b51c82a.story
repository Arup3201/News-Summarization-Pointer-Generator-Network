Attack: The Fathers4Justice advert targeting Kate Holmes. She hit back at the 'baseless' campaign

Actresses Katie Holmes, Halle Berry and Kim Basinger are being targeted in  a new ‘crummy mummy’ campaign by Fathers4Justice, which accuses them of denying their children access to their fathers.

The pressure group is using the Hollywood stars in a series of adverts criticising their childcare arrangements.

The new controversy comes after actress Kate Winslet, who has three children by three fathers, last week threatened to sue for being singled out in a Christmas advert by Fathers4Justice.

Undeterred, the group says it will continue to highlight high-profile mothers who, they say, deny their children access to their fathers for no good reason.

The Katie Holmes poster features a large picture of the star and the headline: ‘Katie, do you believe in equal parents, equal love?’

Text on the advert reads: ‘Katie Holmes demanded  sole custody of her daughter Suri in her divorce from  Tom Cruise, limiting the time the actor spends with her.’

Last night Ms Holmes’s lawyer Jonathan Wolfe criticised Fathers4 Justice, saying: ‘The campaign is baseless and offensive. Katie will continue to have no comment on personal and private matters  that affect her family.’

The 38-year-old actress is believed to have divorced Cruise last year because of her long-held concerns over Cruise’s status as one of the leading figures in the Church of Scientology.

She was said to be determined to shield her daughter from it.

Another poster features a picture of Oscar-winning star Halle Berry with the headline: ‘Halle, a father is for life, not just conception.’ It reads: ‘Actress Halle Berry tried to take her daughter Nahla to live in France against her husband’s wishes.’

In fact, a judge in Los Angeles refused her application to move to France after hearing objections  from Nahla’s father, French-Canadian model Gabriel Aubry. Berry and Aubry then announced an amicable joint custody arrangement.

The poster targeting Kim Basinger, who has daughter called Ireland with Hollywood actor Alec Baldwin, is headlined: ‘Kim, never hate your ex more than you love your child.’

The advert claims that Ms Basinger ‘fought’ with Mr Baldwin over his access rights to  their daughter.

Baldwin blamed the stress of a seven-year custody battle on his decision to leave an angry voicemail message in which he called his daughter, then aged 11, a ‘rude, thoughtless, little pig’.

Last night a spokesman for Fathers4Justice said the crummy mummy adverts were part of its ongoing campaign against the ‘fatherless society’.

He added: ‘As an organisation we strongly believe in 50/50 shared parenting and are concerned that contact denial – where one parent denies a child access to the other parent, normally the father – is not only increasing, but is a serious human rights violation and an abuse of a child’s right to their father.

‘The behaviour of female role models shapes public thinking and we will promote those  celebrity mothers who support shared parenting while naming those who fail to support it.’

The group claims that 200 children lose contact with their fathers every day in secret family courts, that half of court orders are broken and not enforced, and that there are 3.8 million fatherless children  in Britain.

The first advert appeared after Kate Winslet said in an interview: ‘My kids don’t go back and forth. None of this 50/50 time with the mums and dads – my children live with me; that is it.’

Fathers4Justice then produced a poster that said: ‘Kate, every child deserves a father for Christmas.’ Her lawyers said it was ‘misleading and defamatory’.

Ms Winslet’s ex-husband, director Sam Mendes, father of her son Joe, also expressed his disapproval of the campaign, saying: ‘It is inappropriate for this organisation to involve my family and me when they know nothing of our personal circumstances. While I fully support fathers’ rights, I can state this has never been a concern for me or my son.’

Kim Basinger and Halle Berry declined to comment.
