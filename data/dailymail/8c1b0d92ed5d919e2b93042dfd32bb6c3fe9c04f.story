New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman today broke his leg and dislocated his ankle after a fall - from 12,500 feet in the air.

He will now join several of his players on the disabled list after the misstep while skydiving for charity today.

The incident occurred at the Homestead 
Air Force Base near Miami, Florida, as Cashman did his second jump with 
the U.S. Army’s Golden Knights.

One for the money: Cashman suffered the injuries on Monday while skydiving at Homestead Air Force Base

After a successful jump earlier this morning, 
Cashman reportedly found the experience so exhilarating that wanted to 
go up again - a big mistake.

During the landing, his foot became caught in the ground, breaking his right fibula and dislocating the right ankle, the Yankees said.

Cashman told the New York Daily News 'I heard a pop in my ankle' as he made the landing.

He was scheduled to undergo surgery later today to fix the broken bone.

Cashman took the leap out of the plane to raise awareness about the Wounded Warrior Project.

The YES Network reported that the event was the first times he had attempted skydiving, but despite his injuries, it may not be the last.

Despite the injury, Cashman texted reporters on the way to the hospital to say that the leap was 'an awesome experience.'

And Cashman is no stranger to extreme sports to benefit charity, as he has rappelled down the 22-story Landmark Building in Stamford, Connecticut, during the holidays in the past few years.

His injury comes about two months after it was revealed that he was leading a 'triple life' - accused of cheating on his wife with multiple women.

Caroline Meanwell, the mother of Louise Neathway - one of Cashman's alleged mistresses - filed an explosive lawsuit in Manhattan Supreme Court  in January, accusing Cashman of being a 'manchild' who conspired to have his ex-lover committed so the affair would never be revealed.

The explosive suit also accuses Cashman of using scare tactics to force Meanwell into helping him, his lawyer and her daughter's therapist - who are referred to as 'The Gang' - and to turn against Neathway with the sole purpose of discrediting her.
