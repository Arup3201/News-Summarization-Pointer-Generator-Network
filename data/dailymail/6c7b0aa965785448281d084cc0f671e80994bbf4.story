Uber terrifying: New York business traveler Ryan Simonelli was in Washington DC when he says he was picked up by an Uber driver who then proceeded to flee from a city inspector in a high speed chase

An executive visiting Washington, DC says he was taken on a terrifying high-speed race down a busy freeway Monday by an Uber car service driver who held him against his will.

Ryan Simonetti says he and two colleagues were traveling on business when he hopped into a car from the trendy service as an inspector spoke to the driver.

The driver soon pulled off, but Simonetti and company quickly realized that--though the inspector wasn't quite done with his questioning--the driver was very much done being questioned.

'That 
cop’s following you. What’s going on?' Simonetti, in an interview with 
the Washington Post, recalled asking the driver as the car began to 
accelerate.

But the driver tried playing it cool as he headed toward I-395 and away from the District of Columbia.

'Oh
 no, he’s not a real cop,' said the driver as the inspector continued 
his pursuit. 'Sorry, we're going to have to run this red light.'

In a scene Simonetti told the Post was like an episode of COPS, he tried desperately to get the driver to stop.

He said he even resorted to getting physical with the driver.

'It was insane,' Simonetti said. 'I physically tried to force his leg to hit the brake. I ripped off his pant leg.'

Even then the driver refused to stop. Only after Simonetti threatened to injure the man did he finally pull off at an exit.

Crazed: Simonetti says he was taken on the 10-minute high speed ride out of DC and into Virginia where the driver finally dropped him and his colleagues off at an exit before fleeing again--the wrong way up an exit ramp

At that point, Simonetti said the inspector pulled in front in order to try and impede the driver from going any further.

But even that wasn't enough to halt the Uber man's progress.

He soon turned around and escaped by driving the wrong way up an exit ramp.

Simonetti almost immediately spread the word about his shocking experience.

'Was
 just kidnapped by an @uber driver in DC, held against my will, and 
involved in a high speed chase across state lines with police #Crazy,' 
he tweeted.

Though
 crazy certainly is an apt description of the 10 or so minute chase, 
Simonetti soon left the case to the proper authorities as his friends 
and followers tweeted their horror.

'Thanks everyone for the concern.  We're safe.  @uber and law enforcement are dealing with it now,' he said.

Simonetti got a big response when he tweeted about his experience with the trendy service
