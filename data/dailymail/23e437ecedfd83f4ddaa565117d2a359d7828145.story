George at Asda launched its first ever plus size clothing line this week.

Called George Plus, the supermarket fashion brand's new line starts from size 18-20 depending on the garment, and goes up to a 30-32.

As the average British woman is now a dress size 16, the brand has responded with a collection of fashion-led pieces made to flatter fuller figures.

Stripe and butterfly tops are £10 each, the textured blazer is £16 and the leggings £8 each

The launch range consists of 35 pieces, including blazers, skater dresses, embellished and long line tops, leggings and maxi skirts.

Prints include breton stripes, florals and jacquard. 

All pieces are designed in an easy to wear, flattering way while still incorporating a nod to the latest fashion trends.  

George says the plus size market is still significantly under-represented in the fashion world, so it wanted to deliver style and choice for the best value.

Prices start at a competitive £8 for leggings or a simple top, making them more affordable than other High Street plus size ranges like Evans and ASOS Curve. 

Blue butterfly and black and white floral print dresses, both £12 each

Plus Size V-neck Floral Top and Amour top, both £10 each (and just £8 for the leggings)

Head of Design for George, Helen Low, said: 'George shoppers want plus-size clothing that is on-trend, affordable and great quality. 

'It’s important to us that we created a range designed specifically with plus-size silhouettes in mind. 

'We have used our expertise to really work with garments that are cut perfectly, so the look and fit of these pieces means that our shoppers never have to compromise on style. 

'Our range will take each of these important elements and deliver a fashion-forward capsule wardrobe that will make women look and feel great.'

The full range will be available online now at www.george.com

George at Asda launch its so-called Bum Enhancer Jeans promising the look a more pert derrière in an instant.

The illusion garment features shaped padding sewn into the bottom cheek area to enhance the look of the wearer's assets.

From today, the George jeans can save women hours in the gym doing endless squats in a bid to get the perfect bottom. But while your behind may look curvy in clothes, the effect will inevitably disappear once you take the jeans off.

At just £18, they are much cheaper than surgery, and turn flatter bottoms (l) into pert ones (r) instantly

Inspired by the brand's successful Bum Enhancer Briefs, the jeans use clever volume to give slender women the curves they crave.

A survey commissioned by George to mark the launch revealed 64 per cent of women want help with enhancing their curves.

Half of the nation's women admit to being unhappy with the shape of their bottoms in particular. 

The perfect silhouette as voted for by 40 per cent of women belonged to curvaceous Kelly Brook, Holly Willoughby and Kim Kardashian. 

At just £18, they are much cheaper than surgery - or even a gym membership. They come in indigo and black, in sizes 6-24.

Strategically placed pockets, curved stitching details and subtle padding ensure bottoms look peachy in all the right places.

George at Asda expect the Bum Enhancer Jeans to fly off shelves, just like its Great Bum and Tum Jeans which sold at the rate of 120 pairs an hour when they first hit stores.

Head of design Helen Low said: 'The search for the perfect pair of jeans is over! Not only are the styles a fashionable and flattering slimline fit, but the cleverly designed pockets, stitching and secret padding will give women curves in all the right places.

'Shapewear lingerie is a wardrobe staple for so many of our shoppers, so it is really exciting we can now combine our expertise in bottom enhancing briefs with our on trend denim designs. We want our customers to feel confident and look great - and I just know they will fall in love with these ingenious figure fixers.

'For those who already have a pert derriere, we have launched a full denim range that go from straight leg to bootleg, catering for all shapes and sizes.'
