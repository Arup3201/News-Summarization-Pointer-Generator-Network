Solicitor-general Robert Buckand is claimed to have been a member of the Invicta Film Partnership No 25 for nearly a decade

A Tory MP has denied attempting to avoid tax after being named as an investor in a film partnership scheme under investigation by the tax man.

Solicitor-general Robert Buckand is claimed to have been a member of the Invicta Film Partnership No 25 for nearly a decade.

The scheme is thought to be under investigation by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) into whether it is a legitimate business or whether it was primarily set up as a way for investors to avoid paying tax.

It follows a court ruling against two other film partnership schemes in 2011 that found they were primarily used for tax avoidance.

Mr Buckland’s involvement in the scheme is potentially hugely embarrassing for David Cameron who has pledged to tackle tax avoidance.

The revelation comes just days after Mr Cameron faced questions in the Commons about Smythson, the upmarket leather goods firm employing his wife, being based in a tax haven.

Mr Buckland  insisted that the companies he invested in were beyond reproach.

In a statement, the Conservative MP for South Swindon, said: ‘I have not attempted to avoid tax, and my investments are a matter of public record.

‘Before making them I asked an independent, accredited financial adviser to look into the companies, who found them to be completely beyond reproach.

‘HMRC look into many different types of investments, but I have been assured that there is no active investigation into my tax affairs.

‘I pay my taxes as required each year, and I have been fully open with government officials and declared my interests in line with usual reporting processes.’

The office of the Attorney General would not comment on whether Mr Buckland had provided legal advice on tax avoidance issues.

The Sunday Times reported Mr Buckland had joined the Invicta Film Partnership No 25 scheme in 2005, but a memo sent to members last year showed it was now ‘the subject of an open HMRC inquiry’.

HMRC has declined to comment on the case.

The partnership is a sale and leaseback scheme where the rights to a film are bought and then leased back to its producers.

Film partnership schemes were intended to boost the UK film industry by offering tax breaks for investors of low budget films.

But tax tribunal ruled in 2011 that investors in two film partnership schemes were not entitled to claim the tax relief as they were primarily being used for tax avoidance rather than for business purposes.

Most tax inquiries involving such schemes are currently at a standstill as the ruling is subject to appeal.

Chancellor George Osborne has branded ‘aggressive tax avoidance’ as 'morally repugnant’

Following a number of high-profile cases involving celebrities, the Coalition government pledged to crack down on tax avoidance – which is legal.

Chancellor George Osborne deemed ‘aggressive tax avoidance’ to be ‘morally repugnant’.

On Saturday, Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘There is nothing pro-business about defending tax avoidance.’

He added: ‘I am not going to back down. The time has finally come to put an end to a society in which one group of people can play by different rules to the rest.’

Last year after Mr Buckland, a barrister, was appointed solicitor-general, it emerged that he had been found to have breached the legal profession's code of conduct in 2011.

A spokesman for the Attorney General's office said at the time: ‘It is a matter of public record that in May 2011, Robert Buckland was found to have committed a minor breach of the Code of Conduct of the Bar of England and Wales.

‘He was not suspended or fined and continued to practice and sit as a recorder.

‘This finding was removed from the Bar records after two years and therefore Mr Buckland was not required to declare it upon appointment as solicitor general.’

Last week it emerged that Samantha Cameron’s employer Smythson is owned through a holding company in Luxembourg and linked to a secretive trust in the Channel Island of Guernsey, another well-known tax haven.

The leather goods and luxury stationery firm, which has a store on New Bond Street that sells £2,000 python skin handbags, has employed Mrs Cameron as a creative consultant since 2010 on a salary thought to be up to £100,000 a year.
