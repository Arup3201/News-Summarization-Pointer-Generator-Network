Surgeon Marco Moraci, pictured with his wife, who has been suspended by the General Medical Council

A foreign plastic surgeon who left a pensioner scarred for life has been suspended after it emerged there have been 60 complaints about his work.

The General Medical Council has barred Marco Moraci, who is one of a number of 'fly in fly out' surgeons who jet into the UK from Europe to operate in private hospitals and then return home.

Moraci, who lives in Naples with his TV star wife, is understood to have quit working in the UK last year after he failed to compensate Pearl Richman for a bungled facelift in 2010.

Mrs Richman, 67, from Kenilworth in Warwickshire, has been left with scars after suffering from necrosis, a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of skin cells - and was left with open flesh wounds. 

She was awarded £43,000 in compensation by a court in Birmingham but is unlikely to receive the cash as the surgeon's insurance company say he did not report the bungle to them.

The Harley Medical Group, which organised the £8,000 surgery, went into administration but is not legally responsible for the surgeons it uses.

Last month, the GMC stepped in after it became clear that there may be other victims of Moraci, after as many as 60 patients are understood to be complaining about their care.

He has also been stopped from working as a doctor for 12 months while it is decided if he will face a disciplinary hearing.

Moraci has also worked for the Hospital Group, who say that his rights to treat patients at their hospitals had been withdrawn.

Now Mrs Richman is calling for the government to take action over 'fly in fly out' foreign doctors who fly into the UK and undertake procedures before returning home.

She said: 'He never talked about necrosis at all. It wasn't mentioned. He talked about the normal risks but at no point at all did he mention necrosis. I just remember him saying that he would make me happy.

'When they took the drains out of my face it hurt so much, I screamed and it started to go purple. It went from a large purple bruise to a huge black scab that had the feel and look of leather.

'Surgeons should not be limited to their country but the government should make sure there is a level of accountability through qualifications and insurances.

'Clinics should also be responsible for the actions of the surgeons they use.'

Clinical negligence lawyer Jeanette Whyman, of law firm Wright Hassall, is now pursuing the case.

She told the Sunday People: 'Clinics normally ask the surgeon themselves to be insured. If something goes wrong a patient cannot sue the clinic, they have to pursue the surgeon, which is extremely difficult if they are based abroad.

'It is really easy money for surgeons as the procedures are more expensive here and they don’t have to pay for the clinics.

'But if things go wrong very often it falls back on the NHS to put things right, which begs the question why there is not more regulation.'

Dr Moraci refused to comment on the allegations against him when contacted at his Naples home.
