learning disability and a characteristic range of physical features.

Herman's mother wrote on YouTube: 'Hernan, is a bit withdrawn and flees from physical contact.

'He does not like be touched, but Himalaya (the dog) insisted so patiently, and she was so soft that's why it is so moving, she is left to do anything. '
