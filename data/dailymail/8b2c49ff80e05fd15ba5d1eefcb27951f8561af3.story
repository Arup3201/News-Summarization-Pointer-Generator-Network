Rampaging protesters yesterday threw petrol bombs at police and set shops on fire as a march in Athens to commemorate the anniversary of the police killing of a teenager turned violent.

Riot police used teargas and water cannon to beat back protesters in the bohemian Exarchia neighborhood, where about 200 black-clad youths hurled stones and Molotov cocktails at them. A cloud of smoke billowed into the sky from the clashes.

At least two shops were set on fire, and dozens of others damaged. Police said they detained nearly 100 demonstrators.

The clashes erupted after about 6,000 protesters marched to commemorate the 2008 police shooting of Alexandros Grigoropoulos - a killing that led to two weeks of the most violent rioting Greece had seen in decades.

This year's protest was in solidarity with a jailed self-proclaimed anarchist who witnessed the death of Grigoropoulos and who is now on hunger strike demanding he be allowed to attend university classes.

Nikos Romanos, 21, was sentenced to prison for robbery in October and began his hunger strike on November 10. He is in critical condition in hospital. 

The protests come at a sensitive time for the government, which is negotiating to make an early exit from an unpopular European Union and International Monetary Fund bailout programme that has meant years of austerity for Greeks.

At a shrine at the spot where Grigoropoulos was shot dead, mourners left roses and notes.

'I'm leaving this red flower, red like your blood spilled on the pavement,' read one note. A banner was unfurled reading 'When the state murders, resistance is demanded.'

The government had appealed for calm in the days leading up to the protest and submitted an amendment to parliament allowing prisoners to follow university courses via distance learning. But Romanos has insisted on attending classes in person.

Romanos said: 'I won't back down. My response is: struggle until victory or struggle until death.'

The main opposition Syriza party, the country's most popular political force, has supported Romanos's appeal. His parents have also appealed to authorities, saying Greece would soon 'mourn its first dead political detainee'. 

Doctors have said his health is failing. He was jailed with three young men following a February 2013 bank robbery in which they took a hostage as they tried to escape. 

Police released doctored mug shots of the four at the time to remove signs of severe facial bruising caused during their arrests, leading to an outcry.

Clashes also broke out between police and demonstrators marching through the northern city of Thessaloniki. At night, police fired tear gas and stun grenades after a crowd of marchers assaulted two plainclothes policemen.

Prime Minister Antonis Samaras will meet with Romanos' parents on Monday morning, following a request made through their lawyer on Saturday, the government said.
