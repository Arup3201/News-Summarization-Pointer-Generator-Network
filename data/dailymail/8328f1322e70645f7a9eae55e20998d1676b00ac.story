Bill Haas landed his sixth PGA Tour title after a tense finish to the Humana Challenge in La Quinta, California.

The 32-year-old from Greenville, South Carolina, posted a closing five-under 67 for an aggregate 22-under 266, holding his place at the summit where he began the day in the company of three others.

Rivals from further down the leaderboard scored lower over the final day on the PGA West Palmer course, with Charley Hoffman and Brendan Steele charging to a share of second place with rounds of 64.

But Haas went clear with a 20-foot birdie putt at the 16th, and stayed clear.

He found the fringe of a fairway bunker with his drive at the par-five 18th, leaving the ball precariously placed on a ridge.

It meant the five men one shot off the lead - Americans Hoffman, Steele, Matt Kuchar, and Steve Whitecroft, together with South Korean Sung Joon Park - were put on alert for a possible play-off.

Haas, needing to make par, considered a host of unorthodox shots as he assessed the position of the ball, before settling for smartly punching out to make certain of a safe fairway lie for his third shot. From 175 yards, he put the ball 20 feet away from the flag.

With two putts for the title, Haas sent the first to within two feet and coolly obliged with the tiddler to take the trophy and million-dollar pay cheque.

Minutes earlier, Kuchar had missed an 11-foot birdie putt at the last to join Haas on 22 under, rolling the ball narrowly past.

Haas managed to recover from a bad drive on 18 to make sure that victory was his

Haas, earning his first win since the AT&T National in June 2013, said on Sky Sports 4: 'I called my wife before the week started and said I didn't think I'd be able to score this week.

'On the last hole I was grinding it out to the end. Sixteen was huge. I needed that one to give me a chance.

'This is unbelievable. This is great.'

The fright coming down 18 was one he was relieved to come through without any damage on his scorecard.

'I can't tell you what I was thinking,' Haas said of his wild tee shot.

'It was a bad drive. To end up there was pretty bad luck. It was a terrible break but maybe deservedly so with the bad shot.'
