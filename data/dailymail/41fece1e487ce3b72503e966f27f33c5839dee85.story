For someone who became famous as a right-to-die campaigner, Debbie Purdy enjoyed life as much as anyone I have ever met. 

Despite having the most severe type of Multiple Sclerosis, her quick, self-deprecating sense of humour, her deep love of music and fierce pride in her appearance never left her.

That’s why the manner of her death last week, at the age of 51, is so distressing. 

Instead of being allowed to die painlessly and with the dignity she’d fought so hard for, Debbie — who I’d come to know after interviewing her five years ago — was forced to starve herself to death, very slowly and very unpleasantly, in a Bradford hospice.

Hilary Freeman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of just 25 and is calling for a change in the law  to allow assisted dying in this country

It’s the end she didn’t want. It’s an end none of us wants. Who would honestly wish to die in this way when it’s perfectly possible to slip away in your own bed, pain-free and surrounded by your loved ones?

That’s why I, like her, want the law changed to allow assisted dying in this country. I know it’s a controversial view and no one was more shocked than I to read in this paper yesterday of the situation in Holland, where people who are not terminally ill are helped to die by medics.

But that does not mean a better thought-out law in this country would not benefit us all.

Ours is a country where we let vets put dying animals down, but insist that people carry on living in agony and suffer the death of nightmares.

This is something I find particularly frightening. Just like Debbie, I have Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a neurological condition that can cause anything from blurred vision and slurred speech to blindness and paralysis.

I know full well the horror of receiving the initial diagnosis and the constant worry that your symptoms might be worsening. I have felt the cold hand of fear that grips you when you think about the future, about death. 

How you pray you’re one of the lucky ones. How you hope against hope you don’t die like Debbie. Surely in this day and age, no one should have to go through that?

I first met Debbie in 2009 after I’d interviewed her for the MS Society’s magazine about her legal battle to clarify the law on whether a person would be prosecuted for helping a loved one take their own life abroad.

She invited me to the Jazz Café in London to see her husband, Cuban violinist Omar Puente, play. She greeted me warmly, throwing her arms around me with a beaming smile — you’d never have known she was in constant pain and losing the strength in her arms.

I remember watching her as she danced in her wheelchair, losing herself in the music, clearly proud of her talented husband.

I’d been diagnosed 12 years earlier, at the age of 25, after having vision problems and losing both sensation in and control of my legs, which made me fall over like a rag doll.

After months of tests and scans, I was given the news by a rather unsympathetic doctor and sent off to deal with it alone. Like most newly diagnosed people, the diagnosis left me reeling and I feared the worst.

Although MS is a highly individual disease — and rarely a fatal one (most people die of other causes) — no one knows how their condition will progress, so it inevitably makes you confront your own mortality. I knew from the start that if the day ever came when I knew only suffering and dependency, and had no quality of life, I wouldn’t want to go on living.

Thankfully, unlike Debbie, who had the most disabling, progressive form of the disease, I now know that I have a more benign type.

As the years have passed, leaving me still able-bodied and relatively well with only mild sensory symptoms such as numbness and tingling, I know I have been incredibly fortunate. But I also know that the majority of people with MS do eventually get worse, and that my future remains uncertain.

Since my diagnosis, I’ve watched many friends steadily become disabled and dependent on others. And I’ve known a few who have reached the final stages of MS.

Believe me, this is not a pleasant prospect. In ‘end stage’ MS, you become bedridden, paralysed, in pain, incontinent, unable to speak and swallow, blind and deaf, and possibly demented, too.

However good my palliative care might be, I wouldn’t want to end up like this, or to become a burden on my loved ones. And, like Debbie, I wouldn’t want my partner, Mickael, to face prison for helping me to die.

He’s known about my condition since we met — I’m very open about it — and he’s taken it in his stride, but it’s impossible to predict how he might cope if I were suddenly to deteriorate. 

Like Debbie, I’ve always believed that how and when you die should be your personal choice. Yes, I think life is precious, but only those faced with a ghastly death can know how important the manner of your passing actually is.

For me, the crux of the issue is being able to take charge of my destiny. If I were ever to lose the ability to control my bodily functions, to feed or dress myself, or even to eat without assistance, the one thing left to me should be the ability to choose the timing and manner of my death.

Why shouldn’t a medic be able to help me do this? I’m not saying that everyone with end-stage MS or cancer or any other condition should be euthanised, just that assisted death should be an option for them. It’s not for a judge or a doctor or a relative to decide, it’s up to the individual: a way out if you need or want it.

I don’t think it’s too much to ask, after all, we’re already allowed to refuse life-saving medical treatment — for example, a Jehovah’s Witness may turn down a blood transfusion — or ask not to be resuscitated, so why can’t we ask for help in dying too?

Debbie tried her hardest to win this concession for us.

But even though five Law Lords ruled in her favour and insisted the Director of Public Prosecutions must clarify the law on assisted dying, those new legal guidelines, while suggesting prosecution was not likely, didn’t guarantee it. Helping someone die abroad is still illegal.

I can understand the point of view of Debbie’s opponents, particularly that allowing assisted suicide would put severely ill or disabled people in mortal danger — giving greedy, exhausted or selfish relatives the opportunity to bump them off at will.

But, a carefully constructed law would ensure only a sick person who is judged to be mentally capable could ask for help to die.

Someone like Debbie was mentally capable of knowing how she wanted to end her life, but in the end the only choice she could make was to enter a hospice and starve herself. She was too weak to take an overdose or kill herself in another less painful way.

The problem with the law as it stands is that you are allowed to make the agonising choice to refuse food, but you can’t ask for a painless injection. 

And the irony is that with no adjustments to the law on assisted dying, people will continue to kill themselves when they aren’t yet ready to die, when they still have quality of life, because the alternative is too horrific to imagine.

Former university lecturer Cari Loder, 48, from Godalming, Surrey, who also had MS, took her own life five years ago using helium gas she’d bought on the internet.

Her friends say that if assisted suicide had been legal, she’d have chosen to continue living but, aware that no doctor could help her die when her suffering got too much, she took her own life while she was still physically capable of doing so.

Being able to enjoy her life — and wanting to help others do the same — was what motivated Debbie Purdy. She’d been diagnosed with Primary Progressive MS — the most severe form — in 1995, soon after meeting Omar. 

He stuck by her and they married in 1998, but her condition rapidly deteriorated and within three years of their wedding, she was wheelchair-bound.

If it hadn’t been for the case of Diane Pretty, the Motor Neurone Disease sufferer who lost a similar court battle, Debbie might have remained in obscurity.

But when Diane choked to death in 2002 — the very death she’d most feared — Debbie realised she didn’t want to end up that way (although MS isn’t a terminal illness, many of its symptoms, such as choking, are life-threatening) and so mounted her legal campaign. 

Like most people, I prefer to believe I will die peacefully in my sleep. But, in my darkest hours, I imagine how horrific it would be to die — helpless and paralysed — from choking.

I’m not sure I’d be brave enough to face the torture of starving myself to death, like Debbie, or that I’ll have the means or resources to take myself to Switzerland. So I hope that for my sake, and for yours — I’m not just talking about MS here — that the law will change soon.

Meanwhile, I shall continue to celebrate the life of Debbie by remembering the way she could make me laugh out loud about the even most serious of subjects. ‘Because I can no longer feel my legs, having them waxed is now completely painless!’ she’d joke.

I’ll close my eyes and see her dancing in her wheelchair with a big grin on her face and her eyes full of life.
