The NSA has turned to Twitter to help expand their workforce and are trying to lure in new recruits by releasing a code to be cracked.

The tweet was posted on Monday in an illegible code followed by the hashtags #MissionMonday, #NSA and #news.

The code itself- tpfccdlfdtte pcaccplircdt dklpcfrp?qeiq lhpqlipqeodf gpwafopwprti izxndkiqpkii krirrifcapnc dxkdciqcafmd vkfpcadf- has since reportedly been cracked, with the help of an codebreaking website.

Coded message: The NSA tweeted this phrase on Monday and it has since been cracked using an internet codebreaker

The Daily Dot used the site Quipquip to determine the code, reporting that the secret message is: Want to know what it takes to work at NSA? Check back each Monday in May as we explore career essentials to protect our nation.

The code was described as a rather standard- and simple- letter substitution, though it still doesn't qualify as automatically obvious.

Administrators at the National Security Agency argue that this kind of test to root out potential employers makes sense given their role in the intelligence community.

Â 'NSA is known as the code makers and code breakers,' Agency spokeswoman Marci Green Miller told The Daily Dot.

'As part of our recruitment efforts to attract the best and the brightest, we will post mission related coded Tweets on Mondays in the month of May.'

The NSA has tried a number of different recruiting tactics in the past.

Bringing in talent: The NSA has turned to hacker conferences and more traditional web searches in the past

One more creative approach was their decision to attend hacker conferences to find the best from the other side.

More recently, their filled their Twitter feed with rather typical job postings, listing locations of openings and links to full releases.

Previous postings include listings for software engineers, global network analysts, cyber intelligence analysts and network vulnerability analysts.
