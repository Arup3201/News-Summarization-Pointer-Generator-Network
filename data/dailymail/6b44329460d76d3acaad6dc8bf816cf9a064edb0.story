Millions of British TV viewers could lose their signal as a result of new high speed 4G mobile phone signals.

The firm set up to monitor the problem today admitted it was in a race against time to distribute filters to an estimated 2.3 million viewers before the networks go live in the summer.

40,000 homes will lose their signal entirely, and will be forced to use alternatives such as satellite or cable to receive a TV signal.

Bad Reception: The introduction of 4G mobile networks could cause problems for over 2 million British TV viewers - with a race against time underway to get them filters in time.

With the switch-over of TV services to 
digital, a band of frequencies previously used by TV is being made 
available for phone firms to offer high speed 4G services.

This 800 MHz 
band is currently being auctioned by Ofcom to companies that wish to 
provide 4G services.

In certain circumstances, it is possible that new 4G services at 800 MHz
could interfere with some existing terrestrial digital TV signals, meaning viewers will need to fit a filter or, in around 40,000 cases, use cable or satellite providers.

Digital Mobile Spectrum Limited, a new company funded by £180m of the proceeds of the ongoing 4G radio spectrum auction, is in charge of the problem.

The auction is expected to finish later this month, allowing mobile operators to begin building the 4G networks by the summer.

'We need to be fully operational by March to be in place to mitigate any interference issues,' said Simon Beresford-Wylie, a telecoms industry veteran today appointed as chief executive of DMSL.

'I look forward to working closely 
with broadcasters and mobile network operators to ensure everyone 
continues to be able to receive their current TV service.'

He told The Telegraph engineers will be able to predict where interference will occur, based on a 'sophisticated model' developed with the mobile operators.

'We expect to be able to identify affected households.

'We will need to procure millions [of filters] in the first instance,' he said.

'We’re focused on being able to 
provide anyone who may be affected with the information and equipment 
they’ll need to ensure they continue to receive free-to-air TV.'

The launch of 4G networks could leave up to 2.3million consumers without TV services - unless they fit a filter

The areas likely to be worst hit identified by Ofcom include those served by the Crystal Palace transmitter in London and the Winter Hill transmitter in Lancashire.

However, the firm has not yet revealed detailed information of the affected areas.

The services are not the first 4G networks to operate in the UK.

However, EE’s 4G network, operating in major cities, does not interfere with television signals because it reuses the 1,800MHz radio spectrum band originally allocated for 2G mobile networks.

The 800MHz band, ideal for covering rural areas with 4G, is likely to interfere, however, as digital terrestrial television uses the adjacent 700MHz band.

Of the 2.3 million potentially affected homes, regulators have calculated that for almost 40,000 could permanently lose their Freeview signal because a filter will be ineffective.

The chairman of DMSL, Andrew Pinder, said, 'Ensuring Britain’s terrestrial TV continues uninterrupted while Britain benefits from 4G at 800 MHz is a huge responsibility.'
