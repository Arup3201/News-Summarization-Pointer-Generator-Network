A pair of sisters crowned the world's oldest siblings have died within months of each other - just a year after they claimed the title.

Dorothy 'Dorrie' Richards' family revealed the centenarian had died of a stroke just four weeks before her 110th birthday.

Her death comes months after sister Marjorie Ruddle passed away aged 105 on Boxing Day last year.

Dorrie, 109, was the 20th oldest person in the UK when she died last Monday at the care home where she had lived for over ten years.

At the time of Majorie's death the pair had a combined age of 213 years, three months and 27 days - making them the oldest siblings in the world.

They last saw each other at a family ceremony in June 2012 - thrown when the sisters were officially recognised by Guinness officials for their world-beating longevity.

Dorrie's son Philip, 75, from Stamford, Lincolnshire, said his mother would be much missed but had experienced many wonderful things since her birth in December 1903.

He said: 'It is very sad and the end of an era but didn't she do well.'

Dorrie was born on December 15 1903 just two days after the 
Wright brothers had made the world's first successful flight.

While
her sister Majorie was born on April 21, 1907 a couple of months after the Old Bailey Court opened in London.

The sisters grew up in Northampton where their father ran a men's shoe factory, GT Hawkins.

After
school the sisters went to London with Dorrie studying at a physical 
education college in London and Marjorie going to the Buckingham Palace 
College of Domestic Science.

Dorrie's funeral will take place on December 3.
