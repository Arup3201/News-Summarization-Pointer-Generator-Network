A bridesmaid says she owes her life to the chiffon gown she wore on her best friend's wedding day - because it was too tight.

Felicity Hallett, 37, could feel the off-the-shoulder dress digging into her side - and found a strange lump which was diagnosed as breast cancer.

Mrs Hallett, of Bristol, was one of three bridesmaids when her best friend Claire Thomas wed groom Christopher Jones.

Mrs Hallett (right), 37, could feel the off-the-shoulder dress digging into her side - and found a strange lump when she went to adjust it

The mother-of-two said: 'I wouldn't wear a dress that tight normally but all the bridesmaids were in matching outfits.

'It felt a bit tight under my arm while the wedding pictures were being taken.I was wriggling to make the bodice more comfortable when I found a lump.

'I didn't know it at the time, but the dress saved my life.'

Mrs Hallett, a student teacher, saw her GP the next day and was given antibiotics for a suspected cyst.

Mrs Hallett, with husband James, said: 'I didn't know it at the time, but the dress saved my life'

She added: 'It was surreal - one moment I was dancing and laughing and enjoying being a bridesmaid, then I found a lump the size of a golf ball in my armpit'

Mrs Hallett, 37, with Noah, 4, and Martha, 2, said: 'I wouldn't wear a dress that tight normally but all the bridesmaids were in matching outfits'

But when the lump didn't go down she had more tests and was found to have breast cancer.

Mrs Hallett said: 'I knew immediately from the expression on the doctor's face that it was bad news.

'He asked me how I discovered the lump and I explained it was because my bridesmaid's dress was too tight.

'I normally wear loose fitting clothes, so I felt the lump for the first time when I was wearing something snug.

'It
 was surreal - one moment I was dancing and laughing and enjoying being a
 bridesmaid then I found a lump the size of a golfball in my armpit.

Her GP originally gave her antibiotics for a cyst, but when thee failed to help, she was given the devastating news that she had breast cancer

Mrs Hallett has almost completed an eight-week course of chemotherapy and will have surgery to remove the cancerous lumps next month

She has now bravely faced the cameras for a photo shoot to raise awareness of breast cancer

'I'd never felt it before. I couldn't take it in at first because I felt so well in myself, I hadn't felt poorly at all.

'Being a bridesmaid probably saved my life.'

Mrs Hallett has almost completed an eight-week course of chemotherapy and will have surgery to remove the cancerous lumps next month.

When she lost her hair, her husband James, 34, a civil servant, also shaved his head while she was undergoing chemotherapy.

Mrs Hallett said: 'Cancer is such a sneaky disease - I want to tell other women to make sure they examine themselves properly'

Mrs Hallett, mother to Noah, four and Martha, two, later bravely faced the cameras for a photo shoot to raise awareness of breast cancer.

She said: 'Cancer is such a sneaky disease - I want to tell other women to make sure they examine themselves properly.

'I was absolutely hopeless at doing it even though we're continually told how important it is. Doing it could save your life.

'I wonder what might have happened if I hadn't been a bridesmaid and wore that dress.

'Who knows? I just know that I am very lucky.'
