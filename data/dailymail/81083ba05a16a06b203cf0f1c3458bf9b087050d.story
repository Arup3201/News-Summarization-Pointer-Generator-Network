A controversial French comedian is facing up to seven years in prison after he was charged with inciting terrorism while 54 people have been arrested over hate-speech comments following last week's Paris massacre.  

Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, 48, who has convictions for anti-Semitism, has been arrested and is currently in custody at a police station in Paris.

In a post on his social media account, Dieudonne appeared to sympathise with terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, who took hostages and killed five people at a kosher supermarket in Paris on Friday.

Prosecutors launched an inquiry on Monday into the comment by Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, who has already faced accusations of anti-Semitism and mocked the killing of U.S. reporter James Foley by ISIS. 

French justice officials have ordered a major clampdown on hate-speech following last week's attacks in Paris. 

Authorities said 54 people had been arrested for hate speech and defending terrorism since terror attacks killed 20 people in Paris last week, including three gunmen. 

The crackdown came as Charlie Hebdo's defiant new issue sold out before dawn around Paris, with scuffles at kiosks over dwindling copies of the satirical weekly featured an apology from the Prophet Muhammad on the front cover.  

Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack, but French intelligence officials believe the terror group provided inspiration, rather than any logistical or financial support. 

Controversial: Comedian Dieudonne, 48, has previous convictions for anti-Semitism

Since the attacks, France has deployed 10,000 troops and 120,000 security forces in an area the size of Texas to protect sensitive sites, including Jewish schools and synagogues, mosques and travel hubs. French police say as many as six members of the terror cell may still be at large.

France has been tightening security and searching for accomplices since the terror attacks began, but none of the 54 people mentioned Wednesday have been linked to the attacks. That's raising questions about whether Hollande's Socialist government is impinging on the very freedom of speech that it so vigorously defends when it comes to Charlie Hebdo. 

The Justice Ministry sent a letter to all French prosecutors and judges urging more aggressive tactics against racist or anti-Semitic speech or acts. The order did not mention Islam. 

Dieudonne's lawyer, Jacques Verdier told BFM-TV that arresting him for the 'Charlie Coulibaly' comment was 'completely out of proportion'. If found guilty of glorifying terrorism, Dieudonne could face up to seven years in jail.

Dieudonne drew international attention last year after former France striker Nicolas Anelka celebrated an English Premier League goal with a salute popularised by him and which critics say had an anti-Semitic connotation. 

Dieudonne joked that his humour was no different to Charlie Hebdo, but seemingly indicated in the post that he had something in common with Coulibaly. 

'Tonight, as far as I'm concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly' he wrote.

It was a play on words of 'Je suis Charlie' (I am Charlie), the phrase that has become a rallying cry for free speech supporters around the world following last week's massacre.

Footballer Nicholas Anelka, pictured, was fined £80,000 last year for making an anti-Semitic gesture 

Dieudonne said: 'For a year, I have been treated like public enemy number one, while I seek to do nothing but make people laugh. 

Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who visited Paris's Jewish quarter in the Marais last Monday, described Dieudonne's remarks as 'contemptible'.

He said Dieudonne faced court action for 'a lack of respect and a willingness to stir up hatred and division.'

Confirming the opening of a criminal enquiry, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said: 'Racism, anti-Semitism, Holocaust denial, and apology for terrorism are not opinions, these are offences.'

Dieudonne faces up to seven years in prison and a fine of around £80,000 under France's strict anti-terror laws.

The comedian made headlines last year when French footballer Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches by the English Football Association for using a hand gesture created by Dieudonne that many people consider anti-Semitic.

Called a 'Quenelle', the gesture has been described as a reverse Nazi salute, and was used by Anelka while he was playing for West Bromwich Albion.

Dieudonne's arrest came as a 'survival edition' of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine, sold out in minutes and upped its print run to five million.

On the front cover is a cartoon mocking the Prophet Mohammed - an image typical of the one which led directly to an attack on their Paris offices last week in with 12 people, including eight members, of staff were murdered.
