Bookings have surged at the luxury Scottish hotel owned by Andy Murray after it was reported it would be the venue when he weds fiancee Kim Sears.

The 27-year-old is understood to be tying the knot with Miss Sears at the £1.8million Cromlix House Hotel, near his hometown of Dunblane in Stirling on April 11.

The two-times Grand Slam winner owns the exclusive retreat, where plush suites can cost up to £600 a night.

Since it was revealed that Cromlix House would be the venue for the nuptials of the Murray and Miss Sears, pictured, other couples have been snapping up dates at the hotel

And since it was revealed that Cromlix House would be the venue for the nuptials of the 2013 Wimbledon champion, other couples have been snapping up dates at the hotel for their big day, which opened last year after a major refurbishment.

A source said: 'There is still some availability at Cromlix into September but it's going fast.

'Interest has really rocketed since Andy announced he was getting married there.'

Experts are now predicting that the publicity surrounding the couple's wedding is likley to put the hotel in the same league as other famous venues such as Skibo Castle, near Dornock, where Madonna married film director Guy Ritchie in December 2000.

The hotel has its own private chapel, where the privacy conscious couple will be able to say 'I do' away from prying eyes

The hotel underwent an extensive redevelopment after it was bought by the tennis ace and re-opened last year where suites can go for up to £600 per night

Nastasha Radmehr, editor of the Scottish Wedding Directory, said couples will be desperate for some of the tennis star's glamorous celebrity lustre to rub off on their own nuptials.

She said: 'It is going to be Scotland’s version of a Royal wedding and the excitement is already building.

'A lot of women really admire Kim and will want to emulate her.

After winning the Wimbledon titled in 2013 Murray celebrated by climbing through the crowd to share a kiss with Miss Sears

'There’s going to be a great deal of media attention and people calling the venue to try to have their weddings there.'

Murray presented Miss Sears with a diamond engagement ring which is believed to be worth £200,000

Murray bought Cromlix in 2013 for £1.8 million and it opened last year after a refurbishment.

The privacy conscious couple will be able to say 'I do' away from prying eyes, as the hotel boasts its very own private chapel.

The wedding party will also have 10 bedrooms and five suites to chose from, each of which is named after a great Scot, including Robert the Bruce, William Wallace, Robert Burns and even fellow sporting legends Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Chris Hoy.

Several of the luxury suites feature hand-painted freestanding gold, silver and copper baths and the rooms’ 32in televisions screens are disguised as mirrors.

The hotel overlooks 34-acres of secluded woodland, manicured grounds and tennis courts.

Mr Murray and Miss Sears will also be following in the footsteps of the star's older brother, Jamie, who also got married at Cromlix.

He wed Alejandra Guitierrez in a 2010 ceremony, in which Mr Murray acted as best man.

Murray, who last weekend reached the final of the Australian Open, proposed to his 27-year-old girlfriend of nine years with a  three-carat diamond engagement ring, believed to be worth around £200,000, in November.

Ahead of his proposal Murray, who became the first British man to win the Wimbledon singles title in 2013 since 1936, was repeatedly forced to bat off questions about when he would ask Miss Sears to marry him.

Miss Sears is the Sussex-born daughter of the former Lawn Tennis Association Head of Women's Tennis Nigel Sears.

The happy couple will be following in the footsteps of Murray's older brother Jamie, who wed Alejandra Gutierrez, at the same venue in 2010

The tennis player's mother Judy, who appeared on Strictly Come Dancing, has previously described Miss Sears as the 'best thing to happen to Andy' 

She was just 17 and still studying her A-Levels when she met the up-and-coming tennis player at the US Open in 2005.

She was said to have been wooed by the star, who is now said to be worth of £30 million, with a series of phone calls and flowers.

The couples relationship became public when Murray, who grew up in Dunblane, Scotland, won his first tournament in California in 2006 and ran through the crowd to kiss Miss Sears.
