Nasa has said a six-ton satellite doomed to fall to Earth this week will not hit the U.S. as incredible video was captured showing the start of the spacecraft's descent.

Scientists today said that the Upper Atmospheric Research Satellite (UARS) will make its final fiery plunge on Friday afternoon when it is not due to be passing over North America.

Americans had been warned that the 20-year-old bus sized satellite could cause injuries and damage to property as it falls through the atmosphere and drops about two dozen pieces of debris on to Earth weighting up to 300lbs.

Danger: The six-ton Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite will crash to Earth and could land in Britain

The latest predictions of the 
satellites re-entry mean that the U.S. will miss out on the stunning 
sight of the spacecraft as it re-enters the atmosphere.

A Nasa spokesman said: 'Re-entry is expected sometime during the afternoon of Sept 23, Eastern 
Daylight Time.

'The satellite will not be passing over North America 
during that time period.

'It is still too early to predict the time and 
location of re-entry with any more certainty, but predictions will 
become more refined in the next 24 to 36 hours.#

The predictions came as a astrophotographer in northern France captured video of the satellite.

Thierry Legault's clip shows the spacecraft appearing as a beaming mass of light as it plummets to Earth.

Best guess: The satellite could fall anywhere between the two latitudes, where billions of people live

Mr Legault's footage of UARS was 
captured through the lens of his Celestron EdgeHD 14in 
Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope in Dunkerque, France on September 15 - 
eight to nine days before its estimated re-entry.

Filmed at an altitude of only 250km, the body of the UARS is visible, as are its solar arrays.

Mr Legault told the skywatching 
website Spaceweather.com: 'The satellite appears to be tumbling, perhaps
because a collision with satellite debris a few years ago. The 
variations in brightness are rapid and easily visible to the human eye.'

The Upper Atmosphere Research 
Satellite, or UARS, ran out of fuel in 2005. NASA says it will point between 57 degrees 
north and 57 degrees south.

Most of the satellite will burn up 
during re-entry, but a 1,200 pounds of metal metal will still plummet to 
the Earth’s surface.

Astronomer Dr Ian Griffin, from the UK Association of Science and Discovery Centres, says the Earth's atmosphere slows down falling satellites a great deal.

He explained that what remains of UARS will hit the ground relatively slowly and 'certainly not at orbital velocity of 17,500mph'.

Much of any satellite crashing to Earth will be disintegrated by heat, caused by friction with the atmosphere. It's the reason we get shooting stars - created by meteors burning up in the upper atmosphere. UARS is large enough, though, that up over a ton will strike the ground. It will not be in one piece, however:  space vehicles experience incredible stress on re-entry. The load can be as much as 10Gs. An F1 car experiences around 5Gs with maximum braking from high speed.

The reason why the location of the crash site is so hard to predict is because the density of the atmosphere varies so greatly higher up, producing different amounts of drag.

A prediction that was wrong by even a few minutes would mean the satellite landing a huge distance away, owing to its speed.

It’s
being tracked by the Joint Space Operations Center of U.S. Strategic 
Command at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

A Nasa spokesman pointed out that there has yet to be any reported injury from falling space debris.

He said: ‘The risk to public safety or property is extremely small, and safety is NASA's top priority. Since the beginning of the Space Age in the late-1950s, there have been no confirmed reports of an injury resulting from re-entering space objects.

This satellite is far smaller than 
the 135-ton Russian space station Mir, which fell to Earth in 2001 or 
the 100-ton Skylab that fell in 1979. So far this year alone, two large Russian rocket stages have fallen to earth without inflicting any injury.

Mir
fell into the South Pacific, while Skylab hit the Indian Ocean and 
parts of sparsely populated western Australia. Because two-thirds of the
Earth is ocean, space debris usually hits water.

Nasa is urging anyone who finds a piece of the UARS satellite not to touch it.

The
spokesman added: ‘If you find something you think may be a piece of 
UARS, do not touch it. Contact a local law enforcement official for 
assistance.’

It was launched
back in 1991 by the Space Shuttle Discovery to measure ozone levels, 
wind speeds and temperatures in the stratosphere.

But now it’s one of 370,000 pieces of junk floating in space at speeds of up to 22,000mph.

The volume of debris was greatly increased by a 2007 Chinese anti-satellite weapon test and a 2009 crash-in-orbit of two satellites.

The widely criticised Chinese test used a missile to smash an ageing weather satellite into 150,000 pieces of 1cm debris and 3,118 pieces can be tracked by radar on the ground.

The UARS is something of a relic - these days, Nasa satellites are designed to be light enough to burn up on re-entry, or to have fuel to fly up into a higher, longer-term orbit.
