Older people on the hunt for a romantic relationship are increasingly finding it while travelling abroad, new research has revealed.

One in five senior travellers say they would be more likely to contemplate having a holiday romance now than when they were younger and a tenth have admitted to having an exotic fling already.

A small minority even admitted to planning their holidays based purely on their chances of finding love while away.

Romance: Older travellers are now just as likely to find love while abroad as their younger counterparts

The look of love: Pauline Collins starred as Shirley Valentine in the 1989 film about an older lady who finds romance while on holiday in Greece

Although holiday romances have traditionally been the preserve of teenagers and twenty-somethings, older people are no strangers to the concept.

Along with films such as Shirley Valentine, in which a middle-aged Liverpudlian housewife finds life-changing love while on holiday in Greece, there have been numerous reports of marriages arising from older unions - although they haven't always ended happily.

Among them was Mary Cotnoir, now 61, who married a Gambian waiter 35 years her junior only to discover that his real interest was in gaining a British visa.

Perhaps that is why the poll, conducted by over-50s travel insurance provider Staysure, also found that 61 per cent of those indulging in holiday romances wouldn't tell their friends about it.

A lack of a long term future was another reason cited, with half of mature holidaymakers saying that although relationships often continued after arriving home, the majority lasted only a few weeks.

Nevertheless, almost a quarter of the over-50s questioned said that they knew 
somebody who had met their husband or wife on holiday.

Despite the pitfalls, holidays are seen as a good route to romantic success, according to 60 per cent of mature travellers, although almost half ended up with a British man or woman.

Just 15 per cent chose to strike up a relationship with one of the locals.

Ryan Howsam, Chief Executive at Staysure, said: 'For over-50's holidaymakers, whether they are single and going on holiday to find love, or married couples having second honeymoons, romance is increasingly on the cards.

'Our research shows that one in five know someone who has met their partner on holiday. While this is heartwarming we do urge people to err on the side of caution as their own personal safety should be the number one priority.'
