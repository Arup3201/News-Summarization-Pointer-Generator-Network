Daphne Oxenford, former BBC presenter for Listen With Mother, has died at the age of 93.

The presenter and actress became the voice behind 15 minutes of magic for a generation of children during the 1950s and 60s.

They sat eagerly around the wireless to hear her familiar opening words: 'Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.'

Iconic: Daphne Oxenford, actress and presenter was the voice for BBC radio show Listen With Mother

Daphne Oxenford - a perfect balance between no-nonsense matron and kindly aunt - went on to enthral around a million juvenile listeners every weekday, simply by telling a story or introducing a song.

So perhaps the greatest compliment to the lifelong actress and voiceover queen was that scores of adults, who recognised her at various stages during a long and varied career, were delighted to tell her: 'I grew up with you!'

Yesterday the BBC announced that the voice had finally fallen silent. Daphne died peacefully at the age of 93, her family said.

To anyone who didn't grow up in the 1950s and 60s it is difficult to explain how such a basic formula captivated huge swathes of the nation for 15 minutes after lunch, slotted in before mum finished the washing up and sat down to Woman's Hour at 2pm.

But television was still in its infancy - and a narrated tale of animals, cars or some fantastical adventure was entertainment enough for all those comfortably-seated youngsters. It didn't last, of course.

The show, which Daphne presented for 
two decades from its first broadcast in 1950, was eventually shunted 
into an obscure slot with a different format and presenters, and 
inevitably fell victim to TV.

A petition signed by high profile fans such as John Cleese, Harry 
Secombe, Glenda Jackson and Alan Ayckbourn failed to save it from the 
chop when it went out with a whimper, and a tiny audience of fewer than 
40,000, in 1982.

Few may 
have realised, however, that Daphne enthusiastically embraced the 
future. The acting school graduate and former wartime ENSA entertainer 
appeared in early episodes of Coronation Street (as spinster Esther 
Hayes); and later in The Sweeney, Man About The House and Heartbeat.

She played village shop-owner Mrs Patterson in the 1970s sitcom To The Manor Born, and was one of the voices behind Granada TV's irreverent weekly press review, What The Papers Say.

Bizarrely, perhaps, she forged a long partnership with comedian Les Dawson, appearing on various shows as his comic foil.

Her last role was in 2008, playing an elderly Dame Agatha Christie alongside David Tennant in a DVD episode of Dr Who.

Daphne's husband David Marshall, whom she married in 1951, died nine years ago and her twilight years were spent in a retirement home for actors in Northwood, Middlesex.

She is survived by two daughters, Kate and Sophie - and by two grandsons who may yet come to tell their own children how great granny's voice became friend to a generation.
