Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke 
out publicly for the first time on Monday in favor of immigration 
reform, an issue he's been working on behind the scenes for several 
months.

The 29-year-old billionaire made his remarks in San Francisco at the debut screening of 'Documented,' an autobiographical documentary by activist and journalist Jose Antonio Vargas.

Wearing
 his trademark hoodie and sneakers, Zuckerberg disputed the notion that 
he and other Silicon Valley leaders are just trying to secure more H1B 
visas for high-tech workers.

Mark Zuckerberg co-founded  Facebook out of his college room. He took a risk by leaving Harvard University after his sophomore year to concentrate on the site

'This is something that we believe is really important for the future of our country - and for us to do what's right,'
 Zuckerberg told several hundred attendees, including House Minority 
Leader Nancy Pelosi and San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, at the Yerba Buena 
Center for the Arts.

Zuckerberg
 and his former Harvard University roommate Joe Green recently founded 
the organization Fwd.us to advocate for a pathway to citizenship for 
nearly 11 million immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.

But Monday was the first time Zuckerberg spoke about the issue in public.

The
 Facebook Inc. founder said he first became aware of the need to change 
the immigration system while volunteering to teach a class on 
entrepreneurship at a Menlo Park school. Many of the students had been 
brought into the U.S. illegally.

'No
 matter where they were born, (these students) are going to be 
tomorrow's entrepreneurs and people creating jobs in this country,' he told the audience.

'These are issues that don't just touch our part of the industry, but really touch a whole country.'

In April, Zuckerberg teamed up with other Silicon Valley leaders to launch Fwd.us, with the aim of revamping immigration policy, boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research.

In an op-ed article in The Washington Post at the time, Zuckerberg said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues if it is to get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering talented, skilled immigrants a path to citizenship.

'We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, Zuckerberg wrote. 'And it's a policy unfit for today's world.'

Of Jewish extraction, Zuckerberg's interest in immigration stems from the fact that his own great-grandparents arrived as immigrants via Ellis Island, to America, coupled with his experience teaching entrepreneurship at an after-school program.                     
Fwd.us, Zuckerberg said, was created 'to build 
the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, 
innovation and investment'. Screen grab of the Fwd.us website

'My great-grandparents came through Ellis Island.

'My grandfathers were a mailman and a police officer.

'My parents are doctors. I started a company.

'None of this could have happened without a welcoming immigration policy, a great education system and the world’s leading scientific community that created the internet.'

At the top of the Fwd.us website it explains in bite-sized facts just why immigration is important to the future of America and reminds users that: '40 per cent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children' and that '57% of engineering grad students are immigrants. Many will have to leave if we don’t pass comprehensive immigration reform.'

Zuckerberg also called for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and maths.

Today's knowledge and ideas-based economy, the 28-year-old Harvard dropout wrote, is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources, industrial machines and labor.

Fwd.us, he said, was created 'to build the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, innovation and investment.'

Also backing the group are tech leaders such as Bill Gates, LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, serial entrepreneur Sean Parker, as well as Ruchi Sanghvi of Dropbox, who was Facebook's first female engineer.

Major contributors include Google chairman Eric Schmidt, Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer.
