'Mastermind': Prosecutors say Croey Frederick, 43, the owner of the book-buying and selling company Doorkeeper Textz, had paid a dozen school district employees $200,000 to steal and resell thousands of textbooks

A dozen employees from four struggling Southern California school districts have been indicted in an alleged scheme to steal and resell thousands of textbooks.

Those indicted included two librarians, a campus supervisor and a former warehouse manager from financially troubled school districts including Los Angeles Unified and nearby districts in Inglewood, Lynwood and Bellflower, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey said in a statement.

‘Taking books out of the hands of public school students is intolerable — especially when school employees sell them for their own personal profit,’ Lacey said.

All were recruited into an alleged scheme set up by 43-year-old book buyer and seller Corey Frederick, who operates Doorkeeper Textz in Long Beach. 

Doorkeeper Textz was one of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District's approved used book vendors in 2010, 
the Los Angeles Times reported. 

The 37-count indictment unsealed Thursday
alleges that between 2008 and 2010, Frederick paid the employees 
between $600 and $47,000 per person for stolen language arts, economics,
physics, anatomy and physiology books stolen from schools, then resold 
them to Amazon and other major book buyers.

Bitter irony: Investigators say the books were sold to Amazon and other retailers, and some of them ended up in the same school districts they had been stolen from

The indictment alleges that Frederick paid the employees a total of more than $200,000. Prosecutors had not established a total of books stolen, but said at least 7,000 were taken from LAUSD alone.

Some of the books were sold back to the very districts they were stolen from, prosecutors said.

LAUSD said in a statement that district officials just learned Thursday that seven of their employees were among those indicted for acts they called ‘reprehensible.’ 

‘We are outraged by the alleged behavior of these employees, which is the equivalent of stealing directly from our students,’ the statement said. ‘We are taking immediate action to suspend any accused employee currently working for LAUSD.’

Twelve of the 13 indicted pleaded not guilty. The status of the 13th was unclear.

The
suspected scheme came to light after Inglewood Unified School District 
police alerted prosecutors to allegations of embezzlement in their 
district.

Scheme: The Los Angeles Unified School District, which listed Doorkeeper Textz as one of its approved used book vendors, had at least 7,000 textbooks stolen

Prosecutors say the four district at the center of the case have no proper tracking systems, making it impossible to say with certainty how many books had been stolen. 

Mr Frederick has been charged with a dozen counts of embezzlement and 13 counts of bribery. He is being held on $843,000 bail and could face more than 19 years if convicted.
