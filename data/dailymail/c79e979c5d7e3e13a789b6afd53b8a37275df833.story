Working almost 100 metres above those charged with running the country, five timekeepers worked frantically behind the scenes to ensure things ran like clockwork.

They are the Keepers of the Clock and have the unique job of upholding the world's most iconic timepiece - Big Ben.

And last night was the dawn of their busiest hours of the year as the clocks went back and we moved from British Summer Time to Greenwich Mean Time.

As millions enjoyed an extra hour in bed, Ian Westworth and his colleagues faced a five-hour mission to turn back the hands of Britain's most iconic clock

The bell was made in 1858 in East London and took two weeks to cool before being transported to the tower on a horse draw carriage

Once the arduous task of turning back the hands of Big Ben was complete the team set about changing the 2,000 clocks in Parliament which will take them until Monday

While millions of people welcomed the extra hour's lie in this morning, the five-strong team set in motion a complex, five-hour process to move the most famous hands in Britain with millisecond precision.

The foursome were tasked with altering the 154-year-old, 13-and-a-half-tonne ageing timepiece, a focal point on the capital's famous skyline.

If the notoriety was not enough, the keepers faced the prospect of high winds, the famous four faces being plunged into darkness, and the potential uproar were anything to happen to the priceless chime.

However former soldier turned horological forerunner, Ian Westworth, was not fazed by the daunting job, which passed off smoothly.

The veteran of nine years scales the 334 steps to the top of the iconic tower three times a week to carry out regular health checks, measure the pendulum's swing and keep a watchful eye on any deteriorating parts.

The 51-year-old father-of-one, from Beddington in south London, sett up base for his two-day marathon shift to ensure everything went like clockwork.

Pennies are used to adjust the 14.5ft pendulum’s swing, adding or taking them away to alter the time by two fifths of a second

The whole process requires painstaking precision and immense skill to ensure the hands are not wound too far, as there is no rewind mechanism

As the 9.45pm chime rung out over the capital, Mr Westworth and his team went to work, beginning the intricate process. The clock wass not heard chiming again until 2am

'We meet up as usual and take on the foreboding staircase, there’d be no other way for us as it’s part of the romance making your way up them,' said Ian.

'And when you reach the top and move into the belfry you can hear the immense ticking.

'The beauty of the mechanics is what intrigues all of us. It runs on remarkable precision and the fact it is more than 150 years old is extraordinary.'

Big Ben is the giant bell in the belfry of the clock tower, renamed Elizabeth Tower last year.

It stands at adjacent to the Palace of Westminster and was cast at Whitechapel Bell Foundry in east London in April 1858.

It took two weeks to cool and once it was ready, it was transported the Westminster on a horse drawn carriage.

Thousands of Londoners lined the route and cheered as the bell went past.

Once it was hoisted 96metres up into the tower, the finest clock-makers in the capital set about fine tuning every part of the Great Clock, finally getting it to start working at the end of May 1859.

The first chimes rang through Parliament six weeks later on July 11, 1859.

Former soldier, Mr Westworth, said: 'After the job is done you realise just how privileged you are. When I walk over Westminster Bridge and see the thousands of people taking pictures and waiting for the hour strike it is charming to know I am part of that'

It ran uninterrupted for 57 years until the lights were turned off for two years during the First World War to prevent attack by German Zeppelins.

The lights were extinguished again throughout the Second World War but the clock continued to chime despite a German bombing raid damaging two of the dials in May 1941.

'The people who built the clock were pioneers and designed something so solid it could withstand enemy attacks – most clocks can’t handle a bit of rain,” said Mr Westworth.

'The bell was cast in iron and built to last, hopefully for another 150 years.'                     

The first time the clocks were changed coincided with WWI and during 1916 mechanics set about forcing Big Ben’s levers and cogs an hour forward on May 21.

Every year since men have fought through tired eyes and tired instruments to set Britain’s watch.

For some, it brings a heady 
excitement that Christmas is just a few short shopping weeks away. For 
others, it heralds months of doom and gloom until we see the sun again.

British Summer Time officially ends this weekend when the clocks went back an hour this morning.

Debating
the effects of turning the clocks back has been a British pastime for 
more than a century, when the first Daylight Saving Bill was brought 
before the House of Commons.

During
the Second World War the Government moved the clocks forward one hour 
to help munitions factories maximise productivity and allow people to 
get home safely before the blackout.

Between
1968 and 1971 the Government carried out the same experiment but was 
forced to end it after complaints in Scotland and northern England.

Plans
have also been mooted to move to Central European Time - something that
would mean lighter winter evenings, which supporters claim would cut 
road deaths, boost tourism and reduce energy use.

But
the proposals have faced opposition from many in Scotland who do not 
relish the prospect of an extra hour of darkness in the morning.

Clocks should have been put back 60 minutes at 2am this morning as the UK reverted to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

They ensure temperatures are at an optimum level for the changeable metal parts, using heaters in winter and fans in summer to regulate it.

Pennies are used to adjust the 14.5ft pendulum’s swing, adding or taking them away to alter the time by two fifths of a second.

Mr Westworth joked: 'This is the most pampered clock in the world, we still follow traditional techniques to maintain it. 

'It would be much more straightforward to have an electrical motor inside – but all magnificence would be lost.'

He joined lead engineer Mike McCann and the rest of the team, Paul Robertson, Huw Smith and Steve White to complete the arduous task. 

The last chimes sounded at 9.45pm last night before the bell tolled again at 2am on Sunday.

The dial lights are extinguished to allow the hands to be wound forwards without drawing too much public attention.

And the hands are then advanced rapidly to midnight by releasing the escapement mechanism, which regulates the accuracy of the clock.

The team took immense care to ensure the hands did not overrun, as they faced the prospect of winding the hands right round again if it had happened.

In order to ensure the accuracy of the clock is not lost the pendulum is allowed to carry on its motion.

Mr McCann, 51, said: 'On the Saturday we ask a specialist inspection engineer to join us, and we also arrange for scaffolding to meander through the belfry tower to allow us to reach parts that need inspecting.

'We then ring up the BBC to confirm when the bells will be stopped and restarted, as Radio 4 still broadcast Big Ben live at midnight.

'It is a job that requires unfathomable skill from our clock engineers, particularly in moving the hands forward to midnight - if they overshoot we cannot go backwards.'

Between 10 and 11pm the team carried out inspections on various parts of the clock after the going train is stopped and clamped.

The going train clamp was removed and the clock time adjusted to the correct time within one second. 

The clock ran for the next two hours without the hour or the quarter chimes, giving the team chance to check its accuracy and make any final adjustments.

At 1.46am, now GMT, the chime side and strike side hammers were unlocked to allow the strikes to sound the bells on the hour.

Two minutes before 2am the dial lights were switched back on and moments later the bells rang out across the River Thames, completing the process for another six months.

But for the team the next step was to change the 2,000 clocks inside Parliament – working through until Monday morning to make sure everything from David Cameron’s oak grandfather clock in the Prime Minister’s office to the Commons’ wall piece is reached.

Mr Westworth added: 'By this time we are running very nearly on empty so we do our best not to miss any – but not doubt we’ll get a phone call on Monday morning saying we’ve missed one.

'But after the job is done you realise just how privileged you are. When I walk over Westminster Bridge and see the thousands of people taking pictures and waiting for the hour strike it is charming to know I am part of that.

'You forget the eyes of London are on you until you’re back down on the ground – and you have kept the country running on time.'
