A low-pressure system that moved in from Canada at the weekend - dumping as much as 14 inches of snow in New England and battering the Midwest with extreme record-lows - has now moved across to the east coast as America continues to be blasted with ice.

And winter isn't due to officially start for another four days.

All of New England is expected to receive 1 to 3 inches of snow on Tuesday, with 3 to 6 inches likely for Hartford, Conn., Providence, R.I., Portland, Maine, and Boston.

Parts of eastern Maine and into Atlantic Canada will be the most affected, with more than 6 inches of snow, possibly as much as a foot.

Boston could get as much as 5 inches of new snow, while New York - which received 5 inches on Saturday - and Philadelphia are expect to get 2 to 4 inches.

'It's just one (storm) after another,' senior meteorologist at the Weather Channel, Jonathon Erdman, told NBC.

milder air will move into the Midwest, helping to melt the snow from the
 last few days.

Sunny forecasts slated for Wednesday morning will hopefully melt some of the snow, officials said.
