Police in New York are hunting a 24-year-old man suspected of shooting dead a door-to-door pots and pans salesman.

The 54-year-old victim and a colleague were walking from house to house selling kitchenware on Staten Island on Friday night – but one resident gave them an angry reception and told them to scram, police said.

The pair left, but the man who’d shouted at them followed them down the street in Mariners Harbor with an accomplice to the corner of Arlington Place and Grandview Ave and fired six shots.

The victim, who has not yet been identified, was hit in the lower back and right knee and rushed to Richmond University Medical Center, according to the New York Daily News.

He died shortly after arriving, police said.

The suspect, meanwhile, also not identified, has not returned to his home and is currently at large.

Police found several .380-caliber shells at the scene of the crime.

The cold-blooded shooting took place just one block from where 51-year-old Chinese food deliveryman Richard Salvia was ambushed and shot dead in April.

James Sanders, 16, Otoniel Carty, 17, and Devin Hill, 19, have been charged in connection with Mr Salvia’s murder.

The City Council is calling for 1,000 extra cops to patrol the streets.
