Channel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman has apologised to a mosque after wrongly claiming she had been 'ushered' out the door by Muslims during a visit.

The TV newsreader turned up for the British Muslim Council's 'Visit My Mosque Day' last month, but later took to Twitter claiming she had been told to leave.

After CCTV contradicted her claims, she was reprimanded by her bosses and today apologised over the row, vowing to 'take a break' from Twitter.

The mosque at the centre of the row accepted the apology but slammed Miss Newman's 'exaggerations' and the 'deafening silence' which followed, saying her actions  'endangered our congregation'.

Channel 4 newsreader Cathy Newman claimed she was 'ushered out' of a mosque in south London last month - but CCTV later emerged showing her leaving on her own just a few seconds after going inside

Today, Miss Newman admitted the original tweets were 'inappropriate' and said she has written to the mosque

Today she tweeted: 'I have written to South London Islamic Centre and offered my sincere apologies for tweets sent in haste after I visited there in error.

'I accept my tweets were inappropriate and regret the use of the word "ushered".

'My language was poorly chosen and has caused a great deal of offence. I deeply regret that this happened. I shall now be taking a break from Twitter.'

He tweets came after it emerged she had been rebuked by Channel 4 News editor Ben de Pear over the row.

Mr de Pear, who has since visited the Islamic Centre, has also written to those in charge of the mosque saying: 'I have spoken to her [Miss Newman] at length and expressed my disappointment at her actions.

'Her language was poorly chosen and caused your mosque untold and undeserved hurt. This was never her intention and we deeply regret that it happened.'

The argument started after the TV journalist arrived at the South London Islamic Centre in Streatham wearing a headscarf.

But soon after her arrival, she went onto Twitter claiming she had been 'ushered' out of the door, implying the centre had unfriendly attitudes to Western women. 

Miss Newman tweeted about the reception she said she received at the mosque, which was later criticised

Miss Newman's original tweets sparked a row about sexism in mosques on Visit My Mosque Day

On the day of the row, Miss Newman later reported receiving a 'warm welcome' from another mosque nearby

It later emerged the mosque was one of many not taking part in the event and she was supposed to be at another location nearby where her camera crew had been waiting. 

CCTV clips later showed Mrs Newman entering the mosque and start to take off her shoes while having a very brief conversation with a man in the lobby. 

The man at the mosque gestured several times to the left before she put her shoes back on and leaves alone, walking out through the courtyard, the CCTV showed.

Miss Newman spoke to no-one else inside the premises and the entire encounter lasted no more than a few seconds.

Shortly after the incident, she was back on the street and told her 78,000 followers: 'Well I just visited Streatham mosque for Visit My Mosque day and was surprised to find myself ushered out of the door.

'I was respectfully dressed, head covering and no shoes, but a man ushered me back on to the street. I said I was there for Visit My Mosque. But it made no difference.'

The mosque later reported receiving a torrent of online abuse and two telephone death threats which have been reported to police.

Miss Newman, 40, later apologise for the incident and today accepted her tweets were 'inappropriate'.

Miss Newman - who has appeared on Channel 4 news for nine years - says she is 'taking a break' from Twitter

A trustee of the South London Islamic Centre today accepted the apology but hit out at Miss Newman, whose tweets he said had 'endangered members of our congregation and tarnished our centre's reputation'

He told MailOnline: 'The last few weeks have been some of the toughest in our small Mosque's history.

'After initially standing by her claim that she was "ushered" out of our Mosque, CCTV evidence showed no such event took place.

'Then ensued a deafening silence from both Cathy Newman and Channel 4 news after footage from the CCTV emerged. An apology eventually followed, over a week after the tweets.'

He added: 'In her apology, Cathy Newman laments her "poorly" chosen words which she believes "caused offence". We were not offended by her choice of words. We were deeply disappointed that her instinctive reaction to a confusing episode was to assume that she was being mistreated by Muslim men on the account of her gender.

'It was this assumption, exacerbated by the hyperbole in her tweets that caused the maelstrom of abuse and national controversy our centre was subjected to.

'These were not just poorly chosen words - they painted a picture of an incident that never occurred.'
