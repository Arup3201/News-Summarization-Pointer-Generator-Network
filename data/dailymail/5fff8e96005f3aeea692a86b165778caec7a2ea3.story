Dozens of French gipsies have set up camp at an iconic pottery factory in an attempt to snap up prestigious Royal Albert tableware for their caravans.

Up to 40 travellers  descended on the car park of British ceramics designer Emma Bridgewater’s factory in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, earlier this week.

However, despite hoping to pick up Royal Albert plates and saucers from the factory, the travellers have been left disappointed after being told the premises doesn't stock the sought-after collectables.

Up to 40 gipsies have set up camp at the back of Emma Bridgewater’s factory in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire

The gipsies said they had travelled from France to Stoke-on-Trent to stock up on Royal Albert tableware

The gipsies said they had travelled all the way from Europe just to buy the tableware – which is more commonly associated with the Queen and Royal households across the world.

However, they were surprised to learn that they had set up camp outside the wrong factory – as it was the Wedgwood factory on the opposite side of the city which was once home to Royal Albert tableware.

Matthew Rice, the boss of the Emma Bridgewater factory which stocks the famous ceramics designer’s works, told the gipsies the pottery was no longer made in Britain.

He said: ‘They were all French and arrived here on Sunday night.

‘I had a conversation with them and they asked where they could buy Royal Albert tableware and I told them to go to the Wedgwood factory shop in Etruria in Staffordshire.

‘Traditional English gipsies have been known to collect Royal Crown Derby but these wanted Royal Albert. They have great taste.

The group, who brought about 12 caravans with them, were disappointed to learn they couldn't buy Royal Albert china at British ceramics designer Emma Bridgewater’s factory

The travellers have left factory workers needing to find alternative places to park when they arrive at work

‘I told them that it should be made in Stoke-on-Trent but unfortunately it is now made abroad and they tutted.’

The arrival of the 12 caravans has left factory workers needing to find alternative places to park when they turn up to work.

Mr Rice added: ‘The only disadvantage is that they do take up a lot of the car park which could become awkward for our customers, especially when we get quite a lot of visitors.

‘It could affect our business if people can’t park but they did say they wouldn’t be staying long.

‘We have had trouble in the past with things going missing but that happens even when we don’t have gipsies nearby so I am not overly concerned.’

The car park is owned by Stoke-on-Trent City Council but is leased to the pottery factory which means the owners must take action to remove them and clean the site.

Residents living near the site said they wanted to see the back of the French travellers as soon as possible. 

It is understood the travellers mistakenly set up camp outside Emma Bridgewater's factory (above) instead of the nearby Wedgwood Factory Store which once was home to the prestigious Royal Albert tableware

Josh Laenen, 31, said: ‘I noticed the car park was full of caravans on Monday morning and I was shocked.

‘I will be increasing security. I wouldn’t like them to stay for long.’

And Jane Thompson, 45, added: ‘I hope they don’t stay for long now they know the stuff they want isn’t made here.

‘It is nice that they came and wanted to buy our famous pottery but sadly they will have to travel elsewhere to try and get what they are after.’

Experts believe the gipsies want the Royal Albert ware to decorate their caravans.

Travellers’ Times editor Damian Le Bas said: ‘Traditionally china was one of the main means of investment.

‘It goes back to the days when most gipsies didn’t have bank accounts, so they would invest in gold jewellery and china, but nowadays it plays more of a decorative role.

‘Royal Crown Derby is very popular. It is refreshing to hear that the owner of the business spoke to them and is being patient. 

The travellers are said to be moving on from the area in due course after being unable to buy the Royal china

Residents living near the site said they want the gipsies to move away from the area sooner rather than later

‘There are many families who take pride in not leaving a mess and there is nothing more depressing than knowing you will be tarred with that brush when others do it.’

The Royal Albert brand was created 110 years ago in 1904 and the prestigious ware was first made at a factory in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent.

Its roots are found in the Albert Works in the Staffordshire city which were bought by Thomas Wild Senior and his son in 1896.

A year later the company produced a range of Commemorative Pieces for Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee - leading to the presentation of a Royal Warrant.

They then built up a reputation of producing beautiful china tea and breakfast sets and firmly established the Royal Albert brand.

Their English bone china is widely admired for its lightness, translucency and its soft subtle almost pearly white quality.

Earlier this year, model Miranda Kerr announced a partnership with the Royal china brand and the 31-year-old recently unveiled a four-piece set in Australia which she designed herself.
