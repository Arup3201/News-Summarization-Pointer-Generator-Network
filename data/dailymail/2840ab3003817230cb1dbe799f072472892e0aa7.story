Prime Minister Tony Abbott is finishing the year with disasterous results in public opinion polls, with the latest showing voters rate Opposition Leader Bill Shorten as stronger, more trustworthy and more competent.

Mr Shorten leads the prime minister as the country's preferred leader by a margin of 47 per cent to 39 per cent, according to a Fairfax-Ipsos poll. 

The Opposition Leader is considered to be 'more trustworthy, competent and open to new ideas' than Mr Abbott.

Labor Opposition Leader Bill Shorten is seen as more trustworthy and competent that Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the latest Fairfax-Ipsos opinion poll

The result is a marked decline from a survey conducted just four weeks ago, in which the two leaders were level pegging on 41 per cent each.

On a two-party preferred basis, the latest poll shows Labor leading the coalition 53 per cent to 47 per cent - slightly behind a recent latest Galaxy poll, which put the opposition ahead of the government 55 per cent to 45 per cent.

The latest Fairfax-Ipsos poll, a survey of 1401 voters taken by phone December 4-6, come after what Mr Abbott conceded was a 'ragged week for the government.'

The government's image has taken a battering due to the stalling of important budget measures in the Senate and the Coalition's election defeat in Victoria after just one term.  

The Fairfax Ipsos poll results suggest the government's problems run deeper than just having a tough week.

It is the government's worst approval rating since coming into power in September 2013.

Despite the poll numbers Mr abbott has declared 2014 'a year of achievement' for the Government.

According to the poll, Mr Shorten leader Mr Abbott in six out of 11 key attributes.

The study found Mr Shorten is considered to be more competent, more strongly supported by his party, stronger, more trustworthy and is preferred for his stance on social policies.

Mr Abbott scored ahead of Mr Shorten on economic and foreign policies, and on 'vision for Australia's future.'

Two-party preferred support for Prime Minister Tony Abbott's Coalition government has plunged to 47 per cent compared to Labor's 53 per cent in the latest Fairfax-Ipsos poll. It follows what Mr Abbott conceded was a 'ragged week' for the government

There are concerns that Mr Shorten is more easily influenced by minority groups.    

The result represents a huge drop since the government's election in September last year, when the Coalition secured over 53 per cent of votes are preferences were distributed compared to Labor's 46.5 per cent.

The new figures come after a week Mr Abbott admitted was difficult for the government, which included embarrassing back downs on a number of policies.

'I'll be the first to admit that last week was a bit of a ragged week for the government… and I read with great interest the assessments some of you have offered of the government's performance over the weekend,' Mr Abbott said at a press conference last Monday.

He later added: 'Obviously I take responsibility for everything, the buck stops here… I take full responsibility.'

Treasurer Joe Hockey has been a focus of the government's budget troubles, and polling shows his standing among voters has plummeted.

In a recent Galaxy poll, voters asked for their preferred treasurer gave Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull 41 per cent of support while Mr Hockey gained just 22 per cent.

Communications Minister Malcom Turnbull strongly outpolled Joe Hockey as preferred treasurer, receiving 41 per cent support to Mr Hockey's 22 per cent in a recent Galaxy poll of votes. Mr Hockey insists he has no fears of being replaced in the post

Mr Hockey told the ABC he wasn't worried about being replaced as treasurer, despite conceding some of his colleagues 'aren't too happy' with his proposed budget saving options.

The government has been slammed for a number of policies and actions in the last week including university reforms, their planned $7 GP co-payments and allegations that Defence Minister David Johnson spent thousands of dollars on food and wine.
