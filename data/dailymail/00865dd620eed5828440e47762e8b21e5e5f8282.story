It was a tough lesson for this learner driver.

While first time motorists are expected to stall or hit the sidewalk, this novice managed to completely flip their car on Calvary St in Waltham, Massachusetts.

Waltham Police tweeted a photo of the unfortunate Friday afternoon accident with the caption, 'First driving lesson didn't go well.'

Motorist Rebecca Roeder was driving behind the learner and watched the car roll over.

'I saw this live. That's my white car behind it. They drove into a tree, and the wheels rolled up the tree causing the flip,' she tweeted on Friday.

Fortunately the driver and their passenger sustained only 'very minor' injuries, according to cops.
