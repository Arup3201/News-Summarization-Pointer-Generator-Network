A southeast Iowa woman's decision to drive her minivan around a warning signal at a railroad crossing proved fatal after two of her three children were killed when a freight train struck them.

A Dodge Caravan driven by 25-year-old Tara Lewman stopped at a train crossing Monday afternoon in the tiny city of Batavia, where she and her three children lived.

Lewman saw a stopped train on the two sets of tracks in front of her and drove ahead and around the cross arms signalling motorists to stop, unable to see a second oncoming train, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright said.

Fatal mistake: Officials say Lewman went around the cross arms, not knowing that there was an oncoming train hiding from view behind another parked train

‘She could not see because the train was blocking the view,’ Bright said.

Witness Verdae Blom, who works just yards from the railroad corseting in Batavia, told The Des Moines Register that he heard a loud noise at around 4pm Monday and then saw a plume of dust rising from the tracks.

He walked over to the railroad 
crossing, only to discover that two children had been thrown out of a 
crushed minivan which he said looked like a 'tangled mess' lying in a 
ditch.

The
second train, hidden from view, had suddenly appeared as Lewman drove over 
the tracks. It plunged into the minivan's passenger side, killing 
Lewman's young daughters.

The children, identified as Erika, age four, and Kallie, age five, in the press, are called Erica and 
Callie by their grandmother.

Lewman
and her 1-year-old son, Jordan, survived. The pair were airlifted by 
helicopter to University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. 
Their conditions remain unknown.

The
newspaper reported that Batavia Fire Chief Dave Wells said railroad 
crew at the scene helped authorities in trying to revive the children 
and treat the survivors.

Lives cut short: The young girls, Erika and Kallie, were described by those who knew them as happy and playful

‘When our guys got there, the railroad people were already doing CPR on one of the kids,’ he said. ‘It's a very sad thing. Crashes with small children are never easy to deal with.’

Just minutes 
earlier, Tara Lewman allegedly drove around a lowered crossing gate in 
her 2004 Dodge minivan, which ended up being struck by a westbound 
Burlington Northern Santa Fe freight train.

Officials
say the mother of three could not see the train coming because her view
was blocked by an eastbound Burlington Northern that was parked on the 
tracks.

'She knew better,' Tara Lewman's uncle, Bert Lewman, told the Register. 'She shouldn't have ridden with the arm down, but it's just one of those things.'

Bert Lewman described Tara's daughters, Kallie and Erika, as playful and happy, and said that his niece is a 'real good mom' who would do anything for her children.

Kallie and Erika Lewman attended school at the Cardinal Community School District in Eldon, according to another parent Lacey Mills.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, the 
school district posted a message on Facebook that read: 'We are working 
with staff and students to process this loss.'

Mills said she told her 7-year-old son that his two schoolmates had died, 'he had tears in his eyes. 'He's like, "Are they gonna come back?"'the mother said.

Being
a small community, trains do not slow down while passing through 
Batavia as they do in bigger cities, usually going at about 60mph. 

Kind words: A relative called Lewman, far right, a great mother who would do anything for her children

Sgt Bright said the incident is a reminder about train safety.

‘The best thing to do is to wait and not take for granted that the train is coming,’ he said.

Since 1975, the Batavia crossing has been the scene of two other collisions involving vehicles being struck by trains, according to federal data.

In 1991, a driver went around a crossing gate, and a passenger was killed by a train.

Batavia, a city of about 500 people in Jefferson County, was also the site of a 1990 train derailment in which more than 85 people were injured, the Journal Express reported.

The April 23, 1990, incident that involved a California Zephyr train also caused $1.8million worth of damage, or more than $3million in today’s money.
