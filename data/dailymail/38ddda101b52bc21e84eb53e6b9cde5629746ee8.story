The police have issued an official warning urging people to beware the dangers of having a one-night stand.

The warning came after a married man was robbed of his wallet and phone after a one-night stand in a hotel room.

The man, whose wife was not in town, met the stranger in a Manchester bar and invited her back to his hotel room, Greater Manchester Police said.

But his secret tryst turned into theft overnight and he was left feeling rather sheepish. 

The man fell asleep at around 3am yesterday morning and woke at 7am to find the woman had disappeared with his wallet, mobile phone and cash from his trouser pocket.

He rang Greater Manchester Police to report the theft.

Officers were called to an apartment hotel in Manchester city centre at 7.23am.

Following the incident, the police warned of the perils of one-night stands.

In a tweet, they wrote: 'Beware the one-night stand. Call this am from married man who invited girl back to hotel 3am and woke at 7am to find wallet and phone missing.'

Twitter users reacted by saying 'karma' and 'what goes around comes around'.

But others suggested he may not necessarily have been unfaithful.

One user tweeted: 'He might only have played a game of Scrabble with the lady! Surely that's not being unfaithful?'

But Greater Manchester Police responded by saying: 'He'd get 19 points for using the letters "unfaithful" and 50 extra for word over seven letters :)'

They later tweeted: 'Unsurprisingly, he doesn't want a victim of crime letter going to his home undermining the web of lies he has spun with his wife.' 

A recent survey by the site MaritalAffair.co.uk found that Manchester was the most adulterous city in the UK, with one subscriber for every 27 people.
