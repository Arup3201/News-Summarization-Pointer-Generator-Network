Arsenal will face Besiktas in the Champions League play-off round. 

Arsene Wenger's avoided ties against Athletic Bilbao, Lille , FC Copenhagen, Standard Liege but will now face the Turkish side - who recently signed Demba Ba from Chelsea for £4.7million.

Besiktas finished third in the Turkish championship last season but have qualified for the Champions League after champions Fenerbahce were suspended from European competitions over domestic match-fixing.

Arsenal will travel to Turkey for the first leg on either August 19 or 20 with the second leg at the Emirates on August 26 or 27.

Midfielder Mesut Ozil, who has Turkish heritage, was delighted with the draw and took to Twitter to say: 'what a draw! already looking forward to the matches against! @Besiktas! #Turkey #İstanbul #Arsenal #AFC #UCLdraw'.

Arsenal club secretary David Miles said: 'It's nice we have got the second leg at home. They (the playoff ties) come relatively early in the season, and our three German World Cup winners won't even be back, or will be just starting training then, so probably we won't have the full squad to choose from, Nevertheless, we've got a good squad, quality in depth and I'm sure will be okay.'

Meanwhile, Celtic were dramatically reinstated into the competition on Friday morning after it was revealed Legia Warsaw fielded an ineligible player.

A UEFA disciplinary meeting convened before the draws in Nyon and decided Celtic should be awarded a 3-0 second leg victory - meaning the club advanced on away goals.

Warsaw defeder Bartosz Bereszynski came on during the last few minutes of Wednesday's game but was due to be serving a suspension having been sent off against Cypriots Appollon Limassol in a Europa League game last season. 

Victory for Arsenal and Celtic will see them go into the draw for the group stage with the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool who have already qualified. 

Elsewhere the stand-out tie in the draw will see Rafa Benitez's Napoli will take on Athletic Bilbao. 

UEFA said that the vanishing spray, used at the World Cup and to be used in England this season, will be used in the tournament.
