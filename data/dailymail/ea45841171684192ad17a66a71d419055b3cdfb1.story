Kate Robertson was on the other side of the world when she received a mysterious message from her fiancé asking her to call. 

Expecting the good news that Mike Brandon had landed a job, Miss Robertson felt her future disappear when he uttered the words ‘I think I’ve got leukaemia’. 

But given only 60 days to find a life-saving stem cell donor, Miss Robertson found herself racing home with one thought – to save her husband-to-be’s life and their dream wedding.

Match: Kate Robinson's campaign has found a donor for Mr Brandon who was told her husband had leukaemia

An ecstatic Miss Robertson, 31, was yesterday told that a match had finally been secured after she launched a desperate nationwide campaign to find a donor.

And her ‘inspirational’ quest could now save thousands of other lives after the blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan revealed that the couple’s story had prompted a surge in donors coming forward.

The charity said that Miss Robertson’s online drive had led to a 650 per cent increase in the number of people joining the bone marrow register.

Miss Robertson said last night: ‘It’s been an incredibly difficult time so the relief we’re feeling is overwhelming.

‘We know we have a rocky road ahead as a transplant is a serious procedure, but knowing there is a good match for Mike is a fantastic boost that we desperately needed.’

Mr Brandon, 29, will undergo the operation in June and is currently in Bristol Royal Infirmary undergoing an intense course of chemotherapy.

The zoology graduate proposed to Miss Robertson while walking across Porlock Bay in Exmoor only three weeks before she was due to go on a six-month backpacking trip of South Asia.  

Shortly after she left he started to experience night sweats and fatigue and was delivered the shock diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in March. 

Doctors told Mr Brandon that his condition was so severe that he only had until the start of July – when his chemotherapy ends – to find a donor. 

Miss Robertson described the revelation as the ‘the worst day of her life’, adding: ‘I was completely shocked when he told me. My only plan was to get home.’

Luckily, she returned her fiancé’s call only a day before going on a three-week trek in Nepal where she would have been out of contact.

Mr Brandon was initially told that there was a 60 per cent chance one of his three brothers would provide a positive match.

When none of the brothers were deemed suitable, the couple contacted Anthony Nolan and soon took their race against time to the internet where it grabbed attention across the world.

Miss Robertson, a physiotherapist who lives in Bristol, described the response to her campaign as ‘astounding’. 

‘Knowing that there is so much support out there and to be able to visibly see the results of what we are trying to achieve has lifted everyone’s spirits,’ she said.

‘Both Mike and I have loved reading through the posts and messages that have been coming through.’

Behind Miss Robertson’s vigorous drive to find a donor for her husband is a poignant tale of previous personal tragedy.

Her father developed a blood clot in his leg in 2005 and collapsed and died in front of her mother and sister. 

A few weeks later her grandmother died, with her grandfather dying of a broken heart eight days after the tragedy.

When her mother’s best friend Simon moved in to the family home to provide support, they were delivered another blow when he suffered a brain haemorrhage and died within two months.  

...‘Even at the outset we wanted to help 
make sure that there will be matching donors for other people going 
through the same agonising wait - other people’s brothers and sisters, 
sons and daughters, mums and dads, and lifelong partners’

After meeting her future partner in 2009, Miss Robertson found fulfilment in life once again and her determination to act as his ‘rock’ has been driven by this love.

As well as remaining determined to support her husband-to-be throughout his illness, Miss Robertson said it was always her intention to help others.  

She said: ‘The campaign was never just about finding a donor for Mike. 

‘Even at the outset we wanted to help make sure that there will be matching donors for other people going through the same agonising wait - other people’s brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, mums and dads, and lifelong partners.’

Although reluctant to think beyond the operation, the couple have already got plans in place for the future. 

A job as an ecology assistant is being held for Mr Brandon, whose family is from Somerset, and their wedding reception is due to be held in the Roberston family’s garden next summer.  

Speaking about the wedding, Miss Robertson said: ‘Pre-diagnosis he didn’t get too excited about wedding plans anyway, you know what boys are like.

‘I’ve told him that until we get past the transplant, we don’t have to mention it.’  

She is also running the #shake4mike campaign, encouraging people to post pictures of themselves online ‘shaking their faces at leukaemia’ and urging them to join the register.

The couple’s Facebook page has already attracted more than 2,000 members, while Miss Robertson was also invited to sing up donors before Tottenham Hotspur’s last game of the season. 

Anthony Nolan said that more than 7,000 people applied to the register online between May 4 and 12, compared to 939 people during the same period in 2013.

The charity’s Ann O’Leary said: ‘We are absolutely delighted that a matching donor has been found for Mike. 

‘His story inspired thousands of people to sign up as donors, any one of whom could go on to save the life of someone like Mike in years to come.’
