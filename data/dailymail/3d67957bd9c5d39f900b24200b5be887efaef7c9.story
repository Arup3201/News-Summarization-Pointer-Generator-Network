These terrible estate agent photographs showing homes with wild colour schemes, oddly place furniture and even random animals might make you question how the owner ever made a sale.

The genuine online adverts feature a house with a toilet in the utility cupboard and pictures with family pets and even residents in the frame.

Andy Donaldson, from Aberdeen, stumbled across the awful pictures while looking for a new flat in London in 2013 and decided to set up a hilarious blog to show friends his discoveries. 

Peek-a-boo: This dog doesn't come with the house but wanted to make sure he was part of the picture as he popped up in this living room shot

Lounging about: This image has all the makings of a classic estate agent picture - except the resident has decided to take a seat for the shot

Unusual: This house has an interesting downstairs bathroom - it's in the utility cupboard with a precariously placed washing machine above it (left) while this man didn't even have time to wake up before the estate agents arrived to take the picture as he laid in bed (right)

But the digital media manager’s Tumblr site went viral after it started to draw in 100,000 hits a day.

Mr Donaldson said: ‘To begin with I spent a few hours a week searching for funny or bad images for the blog, but since it went viral I am now sent pictures from all over the world.

‘I get up to around 100 new images each week - and I have more than 2,000 great images saved for publication.

‘The photos I am sent come from websites all over the world - from the UK, US, Canada, across Europe, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and even Khazakstan.

A real pigsty: This peculiar room's main resident appears to be a huge pig, which rests its head on the sofa and lies across a rug while washing is suspended from the middle of the ceiling on an iron bar

Multi-purpose: The bathroom in this house doesn't have to be used for its main function - one can also enjoy sitting in a comfy armchair

Worried about the suns harsh penetrable rays? No worries, this kitchen has an outdoor garden table and chairs complete with a parasol 

Caught short: This man appears to have been unable to hold it in as he demonstrated the use of the bedroom's en-suite bathroom (far right)

‘The intention of the blog is not to ridicule individual agents or agencies - it is a difficult job, and everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

‘But if an agent wants to complain about their photograph being used on my website, they would have to admit that it was their photograph, and I think the estate agents prefer to remain anonymous.’

Some of the pictures include an outdoor picnic table with parasol in the kitchen, a house with four front doors and even one occupant sleeping in bed.

Oops: The kitchen fitters probably hadn't planned ahead with this one and barricaded the door in with counters (left) while this home has a strange looking hair piece on the table

Ways to confuse a burglar: This house comes with four front doors so the new owner will have to make sure they have a big enough key chain

The owners of this house decided to demonstrate that a couch can be a garden feature as well as household furniture in this terrible estate agent picture

Conspicuous: This probably wasn't the best place to hide a gun when estate agents are coming round to take pictures of your house

Freaky: This projector room is not for the faint-hearted as it's surrounded by creepy looking clowns and features in Andy Donaldson's book

The clowns are running theme in some of these terrible estate agent pictures - let's hope the new buyer doesn't suffer from coulrophobia (the fear of clowns)

Scary: Another frightening room that featured on an estate agent advert was this one with a Victorian theme - and dolls in plastic cases 

Others show a room with a pig sprawled on the floor as it rests its head on a sofa and another has an armchair and rug in the middle of a bathroom.

He has now turned the photographs into a book called Terrible Estate Agent Photos and the UK version flew off the shelves over Christmas, completely selling out.

The US version is set for release in April and Mr Donaldson is in the process of producing a 2016 calendar which will be available in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

At least you won't get cold feet: This bathroom comes carpeted with a boiler directly above the sink in and a slightly out of place toilet

Wonky: The photographer couldn't quite get the angle on this one as the showroom toilet has not been plumbed in and sits in the middle

This photographer has gone for the 'basement in an earthquake look' with a blurry shot that gives no perception of what the room is really like

Peculiar: This room once had a roaring fire but has since been replaced with a brand new central heating system... directly in its place

Great for the kids: This room has a huge mural painting to Thomas the Tank Engine, but looks slightly out of place with the grown-up bedding

'This place comes with great views': One estate agent even had the audacity to take a picture out the window - a string of huge satellite dishes

Door for The Borrowers? The living room in this house has a slightly unusual entrance with only the top of the door visible from the skirting board

I predict a riot: It's not that easy to make out which room of the house this is - and the upturned furniture doesn't give much away either

Mysterious window: This house comes with large bay windows in the front room which are attractive to small children, according to this advert

A real party house: Mr Donaldson came across these pictures while looking for a flat to rent in London in 2013 and decided to put them on a blog to share with friends. The blog has now become a best-selling book, which sold out in the UK over Christmas

The photos come from websites all over the world - from the UK, US, Canada, across Europe, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan and even Khazakstan

A small child plays on the front lawn in this picture, which was used to used to advertise the sale of the house - although the child definitely isn't included

Secret tomb? This house comes with an ominous looking set of marble cabinets and three mirrors that appear to be built into the walls
