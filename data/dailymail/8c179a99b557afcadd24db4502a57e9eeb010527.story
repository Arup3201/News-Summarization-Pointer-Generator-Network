Valencia will banish a fan who hit Barcelona forward Lionel Messi on the head with a plastic bottle for life once they have been identified.

Messi was celebrating Barca's 94th-minute winner from Sergio Busquets with his team mates near the corner flag on Sunday when someone threw the bottle from the Mestalla stands and it struck him on the head.

The Argentina captain was examined by a member of Barca's medical staff and did not appear to be hurt, giving the thumbs-up as he walked off the pitch after the final whistle.

But to add insult to injury, the Argentina captain was booked for wasting time as he returned to the pitch. 

'Valencia CF regret and condemn the isolated incident in the game against FC Barcelona, in which a small, uncapped bottle of water was thrown from the stands at opposition player Lionel Messi,' the club said on their website.

'The club will endeavour to locate the person who threw the bottle and they will be banned for life from the Mestalla.

'Valencia CF operate a zero tolerance policy on such actions and rigorously enforce all security measures set out by legislation.'

Barca's 1-0 win kept them hard on the heels of leaders Real Madrid, who are two points clear of their arch-rivals after 13 matches thanks to Saturday's 2-1 victory at Malaga.
