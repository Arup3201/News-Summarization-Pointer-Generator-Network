Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg met with the president of South Korea today as part of his attempt to expand the social network's international presence.

The 29-year-old tech mogul even managed to shed his trademark hoodie as he donned a smart suit for the encounter in Seoul.

President Park Geun-hye has held summits with a number of leading figures from the tech world as she seeks to entrench South Korea's position as one of the world's most connected countries.

Meeting: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks to South Korean president Park Geun-hye in Seoul

Formal: The 29-year-old wore a dark business suit for the meeting at the Blue House in Seoul

Mr Zuckerberg visited Ms Park at the Blue House, the official presidential residence where she has lived since being elected in February this year.

The pair were photographed looking friendly but formal - and unlike Bill Gates, who committed a faux pas by keeping one hand in his pocket while greeting the president, Mr Zuckerberg seems to have avoided offending his host.

Ms Park praised Facebook's achievements in becoming the world's most popular social network, and joked: 'It is pleasing to meet people via Facebook, but it is even more pleasing to meet face to face like this.'

Mr Zuckerberg is usually seen in a charcoal-grey hoodie, but has been known to dig out a suit during meetings with world leaders such as Russia's Dmitry Medvedev.

However, he soon returned to his favoured laid-back look when he visited the Samsung headquarters for a meeting with executives.

Facebook is keen to collaborate closely with Samsung, the world's largest manufacturer of smartphones, in order to start making money from users who access the social network through their mobiles.

Ms Park, who heads the fourth-largest economy in Asia, is keen to promote entrepeneurship in South Korea and to boost the tech sector in order to lift employment rates.

In April, she invited Microsoft's Mr Gates and Google CEO Larry Page to the country for a series of talks.

The summit was overshadowed by a notorious photograph showing Mr Gates and Ms Park shaking hands while the American had his other hand in his pocket, prompting accusations of disrespect.
