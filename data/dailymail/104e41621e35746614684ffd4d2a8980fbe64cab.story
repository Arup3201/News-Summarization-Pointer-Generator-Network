We've already had complaints against TSA agents of toddlers getting patted down, a woman's breasts being exposed and groping.

Now a 95-year-old woman in the final stages of a battle with leukaemia has been allegedly detained and humiliatingly searched at a Florida airport while in a wheelchair - and the TSA is defending their actions.

Jean Weber, of Destin, Florida, claims her mother Lena Reppert was asked to remove an adult diaper in order to complete a pat-down search.

Jean Weber claims her leukaemia-stricken mother, 95, was made to take off her adult diaper by airport security in Florida, who are standing by their actions

Ms Weber has filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security after the incident last weekend at Northwest Florida Regional Airport.

‘It’s something I couldn’t imagine happening on American soil,’ she told the Northwest Florida Daily News.

‘Here is my mother, 95-years-old, 105lbs, barely able to stand, and then this.’

Ms Reppert was trying to board a plane to fly to Michigan in an attempt to be with relatives as she battles the disease, Ms Weber said.

Her mother entered security in a wheelchair because she could not walk through by herself and was detained for 45 minutes.

But Ms Reppert was pulled aside into a separate area and patted down before being moved to another room to protect her privacy.

Security staff then said they needed her diaper removed because it was soiled and was preventing them from completing their search.

Ms Weber, who removed her mother's diaper in a bathroom for her, said she did not understand why her mother had such an extensive search.

The TSA released a statement defending its agents' actions in the search.

'While every person and item must be screened before entering the secure boarding area, TSA works with passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive manner,' the TSA said.

'We have reviewed the circumstances involving this screening and determined that our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure.'

A TSA spokesman told the Northwest Florida Daily News it would be dangerous for them to exempt any group from screening.

‘We know from intelligence that there are terrorists out there that would then exploit that vulnerability,’ a TSA spokesman said.

Wheelchairs are swabbed for explosives and patted-down, the spokesman said.
