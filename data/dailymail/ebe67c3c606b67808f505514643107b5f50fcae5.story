West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka has released a statement via his Facebook page asking the FA to drop charges on him for his 'quenelle' gesture.

Anelka has long maintained the 
gesture he made after scoring in West Brom's 3-3 draw at West Ham on 
December 28 was not anti-Semitic, as condemned by many, but instead 
anti-establishment.

The row over the gesture has caused club sponsor Zoopla to decide not to renew their £3million-a-year deal beyond this season, and could also see German sponsors Jack Wolfskin end its backing.

Gesture: Nicolas Anelka performs the controversial 'quenelle' gesture after scoring against West Ham

On Wednesday, Anelka posted on his 
Facebook page: 'The English Football Association has hired an expert to 
decide the meaning of my quenelle... The latter concluded that my 
gesture was an anti-Semitic connotation, which led to my indictment by 
the FA.

'It would have been legitimate for this expert is French, living in France, and may have an accurate knowledge of my actions.

The Black Country club counts German clothing company Jack Wolfskin among its partners and the firm has issued a statement in which it does not rule out the possibility of ending its backing.

'What
 better expert Mr. Cukierman, president of CRIF (Representative Council 
of Jewish Institutions in France), which explains very clearly that my 
dumpling could not be regarded as anti-Semitic!

'He also explained precisely and when the gesture could have such a connotation. 

'I
 therefore ask the English Federation kindly removed the charges alleged
 against me. And I repeat, I am not anti-Semitic or racist.'

West Brom are facing the prospect of losing further sponsors, depending on the outcome of the FA's investigation.

Charged: Anelka has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to the FA's charge over the 'quenelle' gesture

The Black Country club counts German clothing company Jack Wolfskin among its partners and the firm has issued a statement in which it does not rule out the possibility of ending its backing.

So far this week, property company Zoopla, West Brom's club sponsors, have confirmed they will be finishing their £3m-a-year deal with the club at the end of the current campaign.

And now Marvin Troemer, a corporate communications spokesman for Jack Wolfskin, said: 'We are following the developments closely but has no decision has been taken yet.

'The FA is waiting for a statement of Nicolas Anelka before coming to a final judgment. We consider the charges as serious and strongly disapprove of any gestures or statements which are meant to discriminate a single person or a certain group of people.

No more: West Brom announced the that Zoopla would not extend their contract with the club

'We are now awaiting the judgment of the Football Association before taking further steps.

'And depending on what our partner West Brom says, which measures they will take and considering our legal possibilities (contract) we would also consider to end our sponsorship as one option.'

One other sponsor, Holler Watches, have also admitted to monitoring the events at the Hawthorns after Zoopla's announcement earlier in the week.

Zoopla.co.uk is a property website and is part of the Zoopla Property Group Ltd, a privately held company whose shareholders include DMG Media, a division of DMGT plc, the company which owns the Daily Mail and MailOnline.

Anelka earlier offered a cryptic insight into how he might plead after the FA charged him over his controversial salute.

Anelka
 has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to the charge he made an improper 
gesture, and that it was an aggravated breach in that it included "a 
reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or religion or belief".

His conviction appears to be unwavering.

In a post on his Twitter feed on Tuesday night, the 34-year-old has written 'Rien a ajouter', which when translated reads 'Nothing to add'. Pertinently, Anelka includes a link to a video clip on Le Figaro that shows an interview with Roger Cukierman, president of Crif, the council representing French Jewish institutions.

In the short 40-second segment, Cukierman claims Anelka's gesture was not anti-Semitic and that he should not be heavily punished. The FA have the power to sentence him to a minimum five-match ban.

Cukierman said: 'It seems a bit severe to me because it seems to me that this gesture only has an anti-Semitic connotation if the gesture is made in front of a synagogue or a memorial to the Holocaust.

Cryptic: Anelka tweeted 'nothing to add' and linked to a video from a prominent French Jewish leader

Controversy: Anelka (right) has been charged by the Football Association for his improper gesture

'When it's made in a place which is not specifically Jewish it seems to me that it's a slightly anarchic gesture of revolt against the establishment, which doesn't deserve severe sanctions.'

'Zoopla
 pay £3million to sponsor West Bromwich Albion. That gives them the 
right to spoil the famous striped shirts a little, but not to pick the 
team.'

Other pressure groups, however, have called for Anelka to be handed more than a five-game suspension due to his lack of an apology.

Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: 'I know under the rules that on a first-time offence there is a minimum five-game suspension.

'But I think what he did was sufficiently serious to justify a longer suspension than five matches.

'He has not indicated one bit of remorse or regret or apologised for his actions.

'He has simply said he wouldn't do it again and that is not good enough.'

Salute: The 'quenelle' gesture originated from Anelka's friend, the French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala

The quenelle has been described as an inverted Nazi salute and was created by French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, who has been prosecuted for anti-Semitism.

Anelka is a friend of Dieudonne's and the player has insisted his salute was a gesture of support and aimed at the French establishment.

Mark Gardner of the Community Security Trust, which advises the Jewish community on security and anti-Semitism, said the FA should take action against Anelka.

He said: 'Anelka has introduced a very ugly phenomenon into British football.

'Anelka's action risks the 'quenelle' being taken up by actual anti-Semites and used against British Jews: as it has been in France and elsewhere.

'The FA should throw the book at him.'

December 28, 2013

After
 scoring in West Brom’s 3-3 draw at West Ham, striker Nicolas Anelka 
celebrates by making the quenelle — an inverted Nazi salute created by 
his friend, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M’bala M’bala — 
which has anti-Semitic connotations.

The
 gesture is relatively unknown in the UK but there is an angry reaction 
in France with the country’s sports minister calling Anelka’s actions 
‘disgusting’.

Headline: Martin Samuel called for Anelka to be kicked out for the gesture

December 29

Anelka
 says on Twitter: ‘I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic. The meaning of 
quenelle is anti-system. I do not know what religion has to do with this
 story. With regard to the ministers who give their own interpretations 
of my quenelle, they are the ones that create confusion.’

The
 FA begins investigating the incident while Sportsmail’s Martin Samuel 
calls for Anelka to be banned for knowingly bringing an anti-Semitic gesture to a wider audience.

The FA reveal that they are working with an ‘appointed expert’ as part of their investigations into  Anelka’s quenelle. But the delay in making a decision is widely criticised.

West
 Brom’s shirt sponsors Zoopla threaten to end their £3million deal 
unless Anelka is axed. They say they will remove the Zoopla name from 
the home shirts if he is picked for the next match.

Just hours before Monday’s
 kick-off against Everton, Zoopla, who have sponsored West Brom since 
2012, announce that they will not renew their deal with the club at the 
end of the season as a result of Anelka’s gesture.

When
 West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in 
Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a
 gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football.

But
 the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a 
fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and
 stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland.

Here,
 we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of 
its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political 
activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala:
