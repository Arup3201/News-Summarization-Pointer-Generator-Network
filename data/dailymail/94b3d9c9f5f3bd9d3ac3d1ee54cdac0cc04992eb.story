Labour supporters demanding an end to trivial speculation about their leader's kitchen are in for a disappointment: Ed Miliband has invited the cameras into his home again.

Days after it emerged his £2million house has a large family kitchen and a smaller 'functional kitchenette' upstairs, ITV is expecting to film him relaxing in at least one of them.

Confusion about why the family have two kitchens deepened today, when it emerged that the larger family kitchen picture on Mr Milband's Christmas card last year is in fact used by the live-in nanny. 

The godmother to one of Mr Miliband's children revealed that the kitchen Ed Miliband and his wife were pictured in was in fact a 'functional kitchenette' next to the family's sitting room

Mr Miliband tried to cool the row over his unusual domestic arrangements on Friday, insisting he prefers the 'functional kitchenette' where he was seen posing for TV cameras as part of a short film about his wife, Justine. 

The poky room the couple were pictured in last week, albeit with an oven and hob, was revealed by a family friend to mainly used for 'tea and quick snacks'.

The revelation opened up the Labour leader to claims that he was trying to make his family life look more humble than it is, even though his home is reputed to be worth £2.5million.

And 'two kitchens' Miliband invites unwelcome comparisons with the controversy over John Prescott for having 'two Jags'.

Mr Miliband denied choosing to be filmed in the smaller kitchen because it was less imposing.

'The house we bought had a kitchen downstairs when we bought it,' he told the Birmingham Mail

'And it is not the one we use. We use the small one upstairs.'

Pressed again on why he was shown in the smaller kitchen, Mr Miliband added: 'This is the kitchen Justine and I use.'

He joked: 'I think Justine would probably say she wishes I'd spend more time in the kitchen.'

But now it has emerged that the kitchen will appear on screens again. ITV has already filmed David Cameron and Nick Clegg at home.

An ITV told the Sunday Telegraph said: 'Cameron and Clegg have already been filmed in their kitchens and elsewhere and we are due to begin filming in Ed Miliband's home in the next day or two. We were always going to shoot in the family kitchen so we shall have to see what happens.' 

It was also claimed that the second bigger kitchen is used by the live-in nanny who looks after the couple's children Daniel and Sam. 

Jenni Russell, a newspaper columnist, said the kitchen Mr Miliband was pictured in was used for 'tea and quick snacks' and insisted the family's main kitchen was 'lovely'

Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine, the wife of Tory chief whip Michael Gove, wrote an article in the paper sympathising over the 'forlorn' kitchen as depicted on BBC News on Tuesday evening.

She wrote: 'Very rarely do I feel sorry for Ed Miliband, but seeing him standing there in his forlorn little kitchen, staring into the middle distance while sipping from a stripy blue-and-white mug, part of me wanted to rush home from work, sling some jolly painted crockery in a bag and head over there with a tin of home-made brownies.

'Surely that can't really be Ed and Justine's kitchen? All that lovely huge, fancy house, and that is where they do their cooking?

'I hope for their sake that it's actually their utility room, and that some bossy spin doctor has shoved them in there to make their £2million-plus townhouse in North London's trendy Kentish Town look less fabulous and to bolster Ed's man-o'-the-people image.'

In his Christmas card last year, Mr Miliband posed with his wife and children in what appeared to be a larger kitchen

Mrs Miliband, a child actress-turned-barrister, is expected to make a series of high profile appearances in the run-up to polling day

Yesterday this prompted Jenni Russell, the Times political commentator and family friend, to come to the Labour leader's defence – by revealing his actual kitchen is 'lovely'.

She tweeted: 'Ed Miliband's kitchen is lovely. Daily Mail pix: the functional kitchenette by sitting room for tea and quick snacks.' Mr Miliband is godfather to her child.

When a Twitter user expressed surprise, she replied: 'It's not 2 kitchens! More like Times' tea prep area. Can't even sit in it.'

Last night Tory MP Nigel Adams said: 'Clearly there's no cost of living crisis for 'Two Kitchens' Miliband.

'It's a bit rich lecturing people about poverty from his £2million mansion. Red Ed can try as much as he likes to portray himself as a man of the people but the only people he's in touch with are the North London metropolitan elite.'

Last night a Labour Party spokesman declined to comment.
