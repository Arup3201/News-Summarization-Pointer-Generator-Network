The Coalition has been branded a ‘zombie 
government’ after it emerged MPs will take a 19-day break because there 
are not enough new laws to debate.

The Commons is set to break up early for the Queen’s Speech because there are not enough issues to debate.

With David Cameron and Nick Cleg’s parties at loggerheads on several fronts, MPs are preparing to pack their bags on Thursday and not return until the Queen’s Speech on June 4.

The Commons is expected to break up on Thursday, a week earlier than expected, because MPs have run out of laws and issues to debate

Ministers have been stung by the idea they have run out of policies to debate, with Commons Leader Andrew Lansley branding the idea a ‘fantasy’.

The House of Commons was due to sit until May 22, the day of the European and local elections.

But MPs are likely to be given an extra week off, because there is no more legislation to debate ahead of the prorogation for the Queen’s Speech.

It will fuel suggestions that the Queen’s Speech itself will contain little in the way of major new laws, because the two coalition parties cannot agree on their final legislation programme before the general election.

Labour has repeatedly accused the government of running out of ideas, and the latest break will only add to the impression.

Shadow Commons leader Angela Eagle said: ‘We are likely to rise a week early showing that this is a government that hasn't only run out of ideas, it's run out of steam.’

Jon Ashworth MP, Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: 'This is just the latest example of David Cameron's zombie government that simply staggers on despite the fact that Ministers have run out of ideas and have nothing left to say. 

'We need positive measures to deal with the cost-of-living crisis which the Tories and the Lib Dems cannot provide. Only Labour has answers.'

It means MPs will not be back in Westminster until June 4, when the Queen will announce the last package of laws before the general election next year

Embarrassingly MPs have only been back in Westminster for eight days since they returned from a 17-day Easter recess.

They also had nine days off in mid-February for a half term break, which came only four and a half weeks after their Christmas break which last from December 19 to January 6.

In a debate last week Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn said the government is ‘obviously grappling with how to fill up the hours of the day and the days of the week’.

He called for the spare time to be used to allow backbench MPs to pass their own laws.

Leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley dismissed the idea the coalition has run out of ideas as a 'fantasy'

‘In that way, Parliament could become a real debating Chamber, enabling us to debate the issues that affect ordinary Members of this House rather than being sent into yet another recess because the Government have run out of business.’

Shadow welfare minister Chris Bryant also raised fears that if Parliament is prorogued early it cannot be recalled to debate emergencies.

He said: ‘It will be impossible for this House to be summoned, even if the Prime Minister wants it, even if the Leader of the House wants it, even if 649 Members of this House write to the Speaker and demand it, even if the Clerk of the House wants it.

‘We will not be able to sit for three weeks, and during that time, first, there will be elections in Ukraine, which could well be an important flashpoint for NATO troops, let alone anybody else; and, secondly, the Prime Minister will have to decide who will be the British Commissioner, and how Britain will vote on replacements for Mr Van Rompuy and for the President of the European Commission.

‘Would it not be better if we did not prorogue until the day before the Queen’s Speech, so that it was available for us to summon the House if necessary, to hold the Government to account?’

Mr Lansley insisted no final decision has been made. ‘We have no intention of proroguing unless and until all the business that requires to be transacted in this Session has been completed,’ he told MPs.

However, when he set out fortchoming business for the Commons he gave no details beyond this Thursday.

Tuesday 13 May—If necessary, consideration of Lords amendments, followed by remaining stages of the Consumer Rights Bill.

The agenda for this week is hardly packed. At 2.30pm on Monday they will put questions to defence ministers before considering Lords amendments to a Care Bill and the last stages of the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill.

On Tuesday Nick Clegg will face Deputy PM's questions, before a debate on all-party parliamentary groups and any other amendments to laws proposed by the House of Lords. 

Wednesday will see the last Prime Minister's Questions of the session, and debates on the Deregulation Bill and more consideration of Lords amendments.

And on Thursday itself there is only questions to Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and 'If necessary, consideration of Lords amendments'.
