Freed: Tracey Connelly will get a new name and her appearance will be changed when she is released

The grandfather of Baby P has criticised the ‘crazy decision’ to release his daughter from prison.

Tracey Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009, with a minimum five-year tariff, for causing or allowing the toddler’s death.

But she was let out this week following a second Parole Board review of her case last month. Her father Richard Johnson, 56, believes his daughter should stay in prison for life.

He said: ‘Who in their right mind would allow her out? It’s a crazy, stupid decision. She hasn’t served nearly enough time. She allowed her own son, my beautiful baby grandson, to be tortured to death. She’s evil and should never ever be freed.’

Baby Peter, who was 17 months old, died in August 2007 at his home in north London having sustained more than 50 injuries after months of abuse.

Connelly admitted her role in the death and was jailed along with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted of the same offence.

Having left Low Newton women’s prison near Durham, the 32-year-old will be given a new surname and officials will help her disguise her appearance.

Speaking from his home in New Parks, 
Leicestershire, Mr Johnson added: ‘I’ve got no idea what she looks like 
now and don’t care.’

The
 Parole Board says it took into account the nature of the offence, her 
previous offences and progress made in prison. Connelly will remain on 
licence for life.

She 
is thought to have been released on Tuesday – the day it was reported 
former Haringey child protection boss Sharon Shoesmith is to receive 
around £700,000 compensation for her dismissal over the tragedy.

It
 was reported that Connelly will be given a new name and hairstyle in an
 attempt to live her life anonymously – but not a full new identity.

The Ministry of Justice has refused to confirm the reports of Connelly's release.

The
 news comes days after it emerged that sacked child protection boss 
Sharon Shoesmith, whose council department failed to protect the child, 
is to receive almost £700,000 for unfair dismissal.

A Probation Service source said Connelly could be ‘smuggled’ out of jail to avoid her being attacked.

Barker
 and Owen are both currently in prison - Barker was given a life 
sentence after being convicted of rape in a separate case, while Owen 
was returned to jail earlier this year after apparently breaching his 
bail conditions.

Sharon Shoesmith, the former director of children's services at Haringey Council, was sacked over the Baby P scandal

Peter's death caused widespread outrage, not only because of the horrific 
nature of his injuries but because he was repeatedly let down by the 
social services which were supposed to ensure his wellbeing.

Connelly was first arrested in 2006 
after a GP noticed bruises and scratches on Baby Peter’s face and chest.
 He was consequently put in care, but returned home just a month later.

The child was later hospitalised following further abuse, and police were told, but Haringey Council’s children and young people’s service concluded that the ‘threshold to initiate care proceedings’ had not been met.

Connelly was arrested again in May 2007, just three months before her son's death, but was not charged despite his injuries.

Baby Peter’s death came a day after he was taken to hospital, where a broken back and broken ribs are thought to have gone undetected by doctors.

At the time of his death he was also found to have had his fingers mutilated, while he had swallowed a tooth after being punched.

Following the tragedy, a full 
investigation into child protection services at Haringey Council was 
carried out and former child protection boss Sharon Shoesmith was sacked
 from her £133,000-a-year job.

Four other council workers, including Shoesmith's deputy, were also dismissed, while the Labour-run council's leader and the councillor responsible for children's services both resigned.

But earlier this week it emerged that Shoesmith will receive up to £700,000 after winning a court ruled 
she had been unfairly dismissed.

The precise sum has not been made public due to a confidentiality clause signed by the council and its former employee.

Yesterday it was revealed that taxpayers also paid £196,000 to fight her compensation claims. The legal fees were handed over to lawyers by Haringey Council as it tried to oppose her claims through tribunals and court hearings.

It means the full price to the taxpayer of sacking Shoesmith over the death of Baby P and then paying her compensation for unfair dismissal has reached close to £1million.

Ed Balls, who was Children's Secretary at the time of her dismissal, said that the payout left a 'bad taste in the mouth'.
