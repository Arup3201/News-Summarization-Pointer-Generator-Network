In light of Thailand's changing surrogacy laws following the emergence of baby Gammy's story, Australian parents with children born to surrogate mothers are being turned away from Thai airports.

An Australian couple, the biological parents of a young baby born via a Thai surrogate mother, were sent home from Bangkok Airport on Sunday, Fairfax Media reported.

This comes as dozens more parents are waiting anxiously for any news, trying to determine whether the closure of one of Thailand's biggest IVF clinics and possibly many more to come will have an impact on their unborn children.

The couple in question were reportedly detained for more than eight hours by immigration officials, who tried to get them to sign a waiver which stated they had not paid and money for a surrogate or egg donor.

When they refused, they were told they had to remain in Bangkok as they were not allowed to leave the country with the child - whose future is now uncertain.

Officials in Thailand have been sweeping the country shutting down clinics, such as All IVF in Bangkok which could see as many as 50 Australian couples left in limbo, with no information about their children being carried by Thai surrogate mothers.

Permanent secretary of Thailand's Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said his focus is to make sure no children are abandoned during the process.

'My concern... is to ensure that any legislation the Thai authorities are considering takes into account those Australians who already have arrangements in place', he told SMH.

Thailand is preparing to fast-track legislation to outlaw commercial surrogacy, banning agencies acting as brokers, or accepting financial or other benefits.

Advertising for women to act as surrogates for commercial purposes would also be illegal.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Saturday called on the Thai government to allow a transitional period for 'humanitarian reasons' before the ban, to enable Australians to receive children still being carried by surrogates.

The Australian families have already paid thousands of dollars to agents and the surrogate mothers for the procedure, and the fate of any stored embryos is unknown.

There are also rising concerns about the surrogate mothers who may abort their babies as they now have no support from the clinics.

Thai authorities cracked down on the growing surrogacy business after the plight of Gammy, a seven-month-old baby with Down syndrome, whose Australian biological parents allegedly left him behind in Thailand but took his twin sister to Bunbury in Western Australia.

Human trafficking laws carrying a sentence of up to 10 years will be enforced while a surrogacy bill is in parliament, according to the head of Thailand's Department of Health Services Support, Boonruang Triruangworawat.
