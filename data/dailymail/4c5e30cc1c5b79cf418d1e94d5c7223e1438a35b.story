Not so long ago, Daley Blind – Manchester United’s new £14million signing, World Cup star and current Dutch Player of the Year – was in danger of seeing his career disappear down the pan.

Shipped out on loan to Gronigen and mercilessly derided by the Ajax fans on his return to the Amsterdam Arena in the summer of 2010, Blind’s confidence was in tatters and his future in doubt.

He was, they said, only there because of his father, Ajax legend Danny Blind. At times, the youngster’s performances did little to deflect the flak coming his way. Blind looked out of his depth and it seemed inevitable that he would have to leave a club he had joined at the age of seven.

‘The public was not always kind to me, they are quite critical here,’ he admitted later.

It was former Tottenham and Fulham boss Martin Jol who decided to give Blind another chance, and Jol’s successor Frank de Boer who spotted his true potential.

Even then, as recently as two years ago, he was substituted on the opening day of the 2012-13 season at home to AZ Alkmaar with sarcastic cheers ringing in his ears.

That was to be Blind’s breakthrough campaign. He was voted Ajax’s Player of the Year as they lifted a third successive Dutch title – a fourth followed in April together with the honour of being voted the best player in Holland – and he was called up to the Netherlands squad by Louis van Gaal in February 2013.

Blind has been an automatic choice for his country ever since. When Van Gaal’s side finished third at this summer’s World Cup, Blind caught the eye with his high-energy performances as a left wing-back and outstanding range of passing.

People are bound to remember Robin van Persie’s spectacular diving header in the 5-1 win against reigning champions Spain more than the pin-point 50-yard pass that picked out his run.

Blind rounded off an outstanding tournament with a well-taken goal in the third-place play-off victory over hosts Brazil, and his remarkable rise was complete late on Monday night when United confirmed that the 24-year-old had followed Van Gaal to Old Trafford.

It had been expected for some time, not least after the player was seen strolling through Manchester with his girlfriend Candy-Rae Fleur, a model and dancer, on Sunday.

In spite of Blind’s impressive performances on the left for Holland, he is expected to be deployed in a deep midfield role at United. It is the position he filled as he progressed through Ajax’s much-vaunted youth system and one that he returned to so successfully under De Boer last season. ‘I’m indebted to Frank de Boer,’ says Blind.

In many ways he is the archetypal Ajax product; an intelligent, disciplined and tactically astute player capable of operating in a number of different positions and following his coach’s orders to the letter. Exactly the type of player that Van Gaal wants to bring to United.

Some may question Blind’s lack of pace or physicality, even though he has beefed up significantly from the skinny youngster who made his senior debut at the age of 18, more than a decade after joining the Amsterdam giants.

But he has tremendous stamina and a sharp football brain that enables him to dictate the tempo of a game when his team are in possession and then lead the pressing game to win the ball back when they are not.

Most of all, those harsh early years toughened him up mentally and helped mould a formidable character somewhat at odds with those boyish looks and trademark mop of blond hair.

It’s worth noting that Blind Snr also endured a difficult start to his career before going on to achieve legendary status at Ajax by lifting the 1995 Champions League under Van Gaal. Now his son is following a different route, but fate has brought him together with the enigmatic coach.

‘He has put a lot of trust in me and I feel really good about that,’ said Blind after completing his move to Old Trafford.

‘It’s a little bit crazy. I was with Ajax from seven years old which feels like a whole lifetime. But I’m 24 now and I think it’s a good move to make – a chance like this may never come again.’
