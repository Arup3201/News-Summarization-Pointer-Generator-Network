Acute pain: Sarah Bignell contracted Lyme disease whilst on a walking holiday in the Scottish Highlands

When Sarah Bignell developed pain in her hands and wrists in autumn 2011, she thought she might be developing arthritis that was being aggravated by the cold.

In fact, Sarah, 37, who is a vet, was displaying the first signs of a disease picked up on her summer holidays - in the UK - and her case was so severe that she ended up in a wheelchair, unable to work.

'The stabbing, burning pain became excruciating quite quickly, spreading to my toes, knees, back, jaw, neck and shoulders and then shooting down my limbs,' recalls Sarah.

'It was intermittent, but the worst pain I've ever experienced - there were occasions when I thought I'd black out.' She also suffered tingling and loss of sensation.

Sarah, who describes herself as a 'healthy, outdoorsy type', was so debilitated that her GP referred her to a neurologist.

After an MRI scan and various tests ruled out conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Sarah was finally diagnosed with unexplained neuralgia, or nerve pain, four months after her symptoms first began.

By now she couldn't operate at the animal hospital where she practises without plunging her arms into buckets of ice afterwards to ease the pain. Then a colleague mentioned that his sister who'd had similar symptoms had been diagnosed with Lyme disease.

'I'd been on a walking holiday in the Scottish Highlands about a month before the symptoms appeared and remembered seeing leaflets about Lyme in the cabin I stayed in,' says Sarah, who lives in Ashford, Kent.

'But I hadn't paid much attention - I knew it was passed on by ticks and, as a vet, I remove them from animals all the time. I felt my training would have alerted me if they carried a real risk for humans.'

But Lyme disease is a risk, affecting increasing numbers as milder winters and damper summers provide perfect conditions for ticks to thrive, according to the charity Lyme Disease Action.

Official figures suggest 3,000 people a year in Britain are affected by the disease, although with symptoms similar to so many other conditions, such as fibromyalgia - a long-term condition causing pain all over the body - multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome, the charity estimates many people may have been misdiagnosed.

The disease begins with a bite from an infected tick. The insect injects an anaesthetic, so the bite can't be felt, as well as the Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria into the blood.

In two-thirds of cases, this causes a distinctive bullseye-shaped red rash that spreads outwards, usually from the site of the bite.

But it doesn't hurt and may go unnoticed - ticks can be as small as poppy seeds, and often climb up into the groin, armpit or scalp, where any redness may also go unnoticed.

The victim may not even be particularly ill or may have only minor, flu-like symptoms that soon pass.

However in some cases - particularly if they're not promptly diagnosed and treated - the disease can

Sarah then went to see a private specialist in Lyme disease, who recommended doxycycline antibiotics.

'I responded beautifully,' she says. 'Within three weeks the pain had gone and I was back operating on sick animals. Life returned to normal - I even fell in love.'

However, Sarah relapsed last summer. 'I didn't think it possible, but the pain was 100 times worse,' she says. 'I couldn't brush my hair or lift a kettle. I was so weak.

'Nick, my boyfriend of just three months at that point, had to feed me and dress me. And the one time I did manage to make it downstairs from my sick bed, I couldn't get back upstairs again.'

Sarah was signed off from work and had to use a wheelchair. 'My job is my vocation so it was just awful,' she says.

'There was a general fatigue and brain fog so dense I couldn't even remember the names of those closest to me. I was in such agony I wanted to die.'

Dr Tim Brooks, a consultant microbiologist who works with Public Health England testing for Lyme disease, explains: 'If the Lyme organism isn't defeated by the immune system in the early stages, it can spread to other sites - particularly the nervous system and joint tissue, including the brain, causing inflammation that can lead to tingling, Bell's palsy (partial facial paralysis) or even, possibly, low-grade meningitis.

'If the disease is treated at this stage, the patient will usually make a quick recovery, although damage caused by the infection, such as tissue scarring or deterioration of nerve function, can take time to resolve.'

This can take from six weeks to six months, and occasionally even longer.

Dr Brooks is sceptical about patients relapsing, however, saying some take a long time to recover or get re-infected.

'The key is to get it early,' he advises. 'So our job is to increase awareness, among GPs as well as the public, to ensure patients with Lyme are recognised, diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.'

But clearly prevention is also key. An estimated 10 per cent of ticks are thought to carry the Lyme bacteria.

They are usually found living in long grass or undergrowth and are therefore common in woods, moors, parks and even gardens where there is also wildlife to feed on, explains Stella Huyshe-Shires, chair of Lyme Disease Action.

'They attach themselves to passing animals such as sheep, rabbits, mice, cats, dogs and even birds,' she adds.

'In humans, they can grab on to the outside of clothing and find their way onto skin under a waistband or up a sleeve and tend to keep going until they find somewhere moist and warm.'

This means it's important to keep covered outdoors in areas of vegetation where there is also wildlife.

'And not just in the countryside,' Stella warns. 'Hedgehogs, badgers and foxes are common in urban areas and there are deer in increasing numbers in some public parks.'

She recommends checking yourself, and children, for the tiny black specks, including around the hairline, then carefully detaching any found with a cotton thread wound around the tick close to the skin and pulled upwards, or a special tick remover available from vets or the Lyme Disease Action website.

'It's vital to avoid leaving behind the head, which can still then infect,' she says.

If infection has occurred, symptoms typically take from a couple of days to a month to manifest.

'Flu-like symptoms developing after you've been in a potentially tick-infested environment should flash warning signs - particularly in summer and definitely if accompanied by a red rash,' says Stella.

The test for Lyme involves a blood test to screen for antibodies and usually another to confirm the results. Results may come back negative, as antibodies can take weeks to develop, so the test may need to be repeated.

Treatment is with antibiotics, which may also need to be repeated.

After seeking help from specialists in the U.S. - where Lyme disease is more common - and persuading her GP to follow their advice on medication, Sarah began a second course of antibiotics last December which has reduced her pain by three-quarters.

She is still on medication, but has less need for her wheelchair. 'It takes two days in bed to get my energy back after having a bath,' she says. 'But I feel much better and hope I will soon be back at work.'
