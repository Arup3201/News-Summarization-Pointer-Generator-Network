Braintree District Council took chicken farmer Anthony Block to court after one of the residents neighbouring the farm made a complaint

A magistrate has laughed a council out of court after they hauled a rural farmer to the dock for failing to stop his chickens crowing too loudly.

Anthony Block, 52, laughed when he first heard Braintree District Council's plan to drag him in front of magistrates over his free range chicken farm near Finchingfield, Essex.

Mr Block is accused of falling fowl of a noise abatement order he received three years ago calling on him to prevent his chickens ‘crowing at a level likely to result in reasonable cause for complaint from occupiers of nearby residential properties'.

But despite baffled magistrates refusing to enforce a fine, Mr Block has still been left with £115 legal costs and a criminal record following the barmy conviction.

He said: 'What next? Are they going to complain about the birds in the trees being too noisy?

'My business has been here since 2002 and all of a sudden they are too noisy - it just doesn't make any sense.

'The magistrates laughed the case out of court as they thought it was a waste of time and money so I don't understand why the council were allowed to take it this far.

'I thought it was a joke when the council first phoned me up about a complaint from a neighbour about my chickens being too loud - it's absolute madness that I now have a conviction for it.'

Mr Block claims he was 'bullied' into pleading guilty to failing to comply with the noise abatement notice after council officials threatened to involve costly lawyers and charge him for the legal bills.

He added: 'The council have been totally against me the whole way. They threatened to get a barrister in and charge me for costs.

'I was worried it was going to end up costing me thousands so I felt bullied into accepting the charge.'

Mr Block appeared in the dock charged with breaching a noise abatement notice - despite the council admitting no decibel readings were ever taken.

Instead the charge was brought merely on the basis of a council officer's ‘professional opinion' following a visit to the farm.

The life-long farmer was handed a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £115 legal costs at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court last week.

Chairman of the bench Michael Rothon said: 'I am not sure it's written down anywhere how many decibels a cockerel is allowed to make.

'It's a farm with chickens so you expect to hear noise.

'We're giving you a conditional discharge as we really don't want to waste any more time on it.'

The neighbour who made the complaint against Mr Block declined to comment when approached for an interview.

Wendy Schmitt, a Braintree district councillor, defended the court action saying: 'Although this is quite an unusual case, it is clear that the noise caused by the animals was excessive, often taking place over night, and as such action was required.

'Excessive noise either from a residential or commercial property can make people's lives a misery and in this case despite having a large

plot of land, the cockerels were being housed in a way that was causing upset for neighbours.

'The council will always look to act when appropriate to do so.'
