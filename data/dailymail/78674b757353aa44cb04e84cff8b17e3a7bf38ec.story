The surviving accused Boston Marathon bombing suspect wants a second lawyer added to his taxpayer-funded legal brain trust.

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s current lawyer filed a motion Monday in court requesting Virginia attorney David Bruck, said to be a death penalty expert, be added to the alleged terrorist’s publicly subsidized defense team.

Bruck was able to negotiate life sentences for several notable terrorists including one of the hijackers of Pan Am flight 82 in 1986 and one of the four men convicted for bombing the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, according to reports.

This is the second request made by Tsarnaev lawyer Judy Clarke to add Bruck, the first one was denied in April by a judge, according to New England Cable News.

Tsarnaev, 19, pled not guilty last week to 30 federal charges, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction, related to the bombs both he and brother Tamarlan Tsarnaev set off near the Boston marathon finish line April 15, killing three and wounding hundreds, according to WCVB. Tsarnaev also pled not guilty to charges from a carjacking and the murder of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer during a next-day getaway attempt.

Hospitalized since capture with severe wounds sustained during repeated exchanges of gunfire that terrorized local residents and forced police to close many roads and shut down mass transit, effectively paralyzing the region, Tsarnaev is looking to avoid being executed if found guilty of the 17 charges that carry the death penalty.

In the filing, Clarke wrote ‘If this case did not present ‘exceptional circumstances’ justifying appointment of an additional lawyer learned in the law applicable to capital cases ... no case would,’ according to the Boston Herald.

Tsarnaev, who is currently being held without bail in a federal prison in Massachusetts, has pleaded not guilty to 30 counts - including the four killings - associated with the bombing

‘Media reports have described the global scope of the investigation, involving hundreds of agents and witness interviews,’ Clark continued, according to the Herald, ‘counsel expect that the amount of discovery that this investigation will produce will be truly massive. Thus even were this not a potentially capital case, the magnitude of the task confronting Mr. Tsarnaev’s attorneys would be daunting.’

Clarke is also a death penalty expert, having negotiated life sentences for Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and 1996 Atlanta Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph, the Herald said.

Prosecutors have not yet decided whether to pursue the death penalty, according to reports.
