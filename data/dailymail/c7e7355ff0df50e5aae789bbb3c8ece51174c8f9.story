For ardent bibliophiles, a shopping trip to this book shop must be close to a spiritual experience.

Broerenkerk, the famed 15th century Dominican church in Zwolle, Netherlands, has been transformed into a stunning modern book store.

Architects BK. Architecten were allowed 
to radically redesign the interior of the 547-year-old Gothic building on the 
strict condition they left the original features, such as the pipe 
organ, stained glass windows and decor intact.

Transformation: A collection of book stands now fills the void beneath the stunning vaulted ceiling of the 15th century cathedral in Zwolle, Netherlands

Design constraints: Architects BK. Architecten were allowed to radically redesign the interior of the 547-year-old building on the strict condition they left the original features, such as the pipe organ, intact

The tight building conditions and regulations associated with this unique project means designers had to come up with clever solutions in order to maximise the use of space.

Designers have managed to squeeze three floors of retail space into the lofty wings of the cathedral by installing a freestanding and temporary structure.

It can be removed at a later date so that the church can be returned to its original purpose.

The shop, Waanders in de Broeren, opened earlier this summer and so far has welcomed tens of thousands of shoppers through the grand entrance.

Spiritual experience: Architects tried to retain the character of the majestic medieval cathedral, leaving the stained glass window, pipe organ and decor unchanged

Heavenly: Visitors to the book shop's restaurant are bathed in light from the huge stained glass windows at one end of the hall

The architects said: 'We wanted all the additions made to the church to be sober, in respect to the church, modest.'

They have now incorporated more than 700 square meters of shopping space - including a restaurant.

The Broerenkerk church was part of the Dominican monastery founded in 1465.

The monastery was closed in 1580 and the monks were expelled.

From 1640 until 1982 the church was used for Protestant services. After a restoration in 1983 to 1988 it served as a venue for cultural events.

pectacular: A temporary structure that holds three levels of retail space has been added inside the wings of the church

Attraction: The shop Waanders In de Broeren has been attracting thousands of customers to the 15th Century cathedral since it opened in the summer

Good read: Three retail floors have been squeezed into the colossal wings on either side of the cathedral

Redesign: The interior of the famous Broerenkerk cathedral, pictured, was transformed into a light-filled modern book shop
