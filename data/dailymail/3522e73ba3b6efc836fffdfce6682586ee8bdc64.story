This is the moment an inquisitive squirrel was spotted taking time out to smell the daisies.

The curious creature couldn't resist sniffing some local Erigeron flowers as it made its way through fields near Vienna, Austria.

But while it might look like its simply taking the time to appreciate the summer blooms - the squirrel was in fact on the hunt for the tastiest flower of the bunch.

That smells nice! The squirrel stands up on its hind legs, grasping the stem with its paws, and takes a sniff of the daisies. The moment was captured as the inquisitive squirrel scampered across a field in Vienna, Austria

Seen pulling the plant towards its nose, the rarely-seen animal was captured by Austrian photographer, Julian Ghahreman-Rad, 23, who was hiding in the bushes nearby.

Reaching out with a tiny paw, the squirrel is first seen bending the stem closer, before bringing the blooms to its nose with a gentle tug.

After sniffing the individual flowers, the squirrel decides on the one that smells the best - and leans in for a bite.

Mr Ghahreman-Rad used a camouflage net to stay hidden from the timid animal.

Hewas forced to stay hidden for three hours before catching a glimpse of the endangered European ground squirrel.

And he was able to stay still enough to capture the animal in these tender photographs.

Which one? With a tiny paw, the squirrel brings the buds close enough to touch its nose. The photographer captured the incredible images by lying quietly on his stomach in some nearby bushes for three hours

Lunchtime! After spending time sniffing out its favourite one, the hungry squirrel takes a bite of its pick of the bunch. Mr Ghahreman-Rad said the trick to taking photos of the timid creature was to make yourself 'invisible'

Mr Ghahreman-Rad said:
 'It wasn't an easy task getting these shots, European ground squirrels 
are not easy to find, but I knew I just had to be patient and wait.

'When
 you want to take professional photos of them you have to be at eye 
level with the squirrels, that means you have to lay on your stomach for
 quite a few hour in order to get the squirrels in front of your lens.

'Basically, you have to make yourself invisible, they are extremely timid so you it is important that they have no indication you are there.

'The moment I saw the ground squirrel reaching for the flower I knew it would be a special and unique shot.

'I was so pleased with the results, it really does look as if it is smelling the flowers but of course it is searching for some lunch.

'Those few shots are some of my favourite pictures I've ever taken and I feel lucky to have them in my own photo collection.'
