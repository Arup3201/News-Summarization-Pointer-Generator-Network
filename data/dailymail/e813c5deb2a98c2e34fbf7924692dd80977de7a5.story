A British cruise line company has been forced to divert two ships with thousands of passengers due to visit Argentina because of increasing tensions over the Falkland Islands.

The Argentine government refused to guarantee P&O Cruises permission to dock in three ports as its two luxury liners were planning visiting the Falklands before Buenos Aires.

This follows last week’s accusations by the British government that Argentina is ‘intimidating’ British cruise liners near the Falkland Islands.

Refusing entry: P&O Cruises' Arcadia has been diverted from Argentina in the latest 'intimidating' move by the Argentine government blocking British cruise liners

Seven such incidents, where protestors or industrial action by militant unions have disrupted cruise liners bound for the Falklands, have now occurred in the past two months.

It is understood that last month, the British Government ‘formally summoned’ the Argentine Ambassador Alicia Castro to protest against the incidents involving thousands of passengers since mid-November.

The move by Argentina to effectively block the British liners comes after a year of tense negotiations between P&O's sister company Cunard and rulers of the South American country.

Argentine officials are unhappy the luxury liners, Arcadia and Adonia, planned to visit the Falklands before docking in Buenos Aires, Puerto Madryn and Ushuaia, to refuel and collect food supplies.

P&O had also arranged for 400 passengers, who pay up to £10,000 for tickets, join the cruise in Buenos Aires but and have now had to re-route them to Uruguay or offer a full refund.

Word war: Last week, President Kirchner published an open letter, disguised as an advert in several newspapers including The Guardian, saying the Falklands were 'forcibly stripped' from Argentina

Hugo Swire, Foreign and Commonwealth 
Affairs minister Hugo Swire said last week: We condemn unequivocally any
 efforts to intimidate companies from pursuing their lawful business.

‘The
 British government deeply regrets that elements in Argentina have 
recently taken action aimed at disrupting cruise ships that visit the 
Falklands.’

The Foreign Office last night said there had been around six incidents in recent weeks.

They
 include officials refusing permission entry Argentine ports or delaying
 ships, masked militants attacking and ransacking offices of shipping 
companies and scheduled cruise itineraries either altered, or abandoned,
 to appease locals.

Tensions
 escalated between Britain and Argentina last week after Cristina 
Kirchner, Argentina’s president, published an open letter to David 
Cameron calling for the region to be returned to her Government’s 
control.

The letter, disguised as an advert published in several newspapers including The Guardian, Kirchner said the South Atlantic islands were 'forcibly stripped' from Argentina 180 years ago today 'in a blatant exercise of 19th-century colonialism'. 

The FCO has 
accused Argentina of trying to strangle the islands’ economy, which 
earns £10million from cruise ship tourism which employs around a quarter
 of the working population.

 restaurant owner Hattie Kilmartin said: ‘Ours is one of many small 
businesses being destroyed by Argentina's bullying tactics. They are 
driving us out of business.’

A P&O spokesperson said: ‘On 
numerous occasions over the last year ships associated with Britain and 
flying the red ensign have not been permitted to call into Argentina or 
have been severely delayed.

‘Over the past few months we have been
 working with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and our local agents 
to gain assurances from the Argentine government that our ships will be 
allowed to call into their ports.

‘We have been unable to gain these assurances and the risk of being refused entry or being delayed is too high.

‘As
 a British cruise company we cannot allow ourselves to be the subject of
 any political dispute or put our customers and crew into any situation 
where their enjoyment may be compromised.

‘With
 this in mind, we have had to take the difficult decision to remove all 
Argentinian ports of call in 2013 from Arcadia and Adonia itineraries.’

The 2,106-passenger Arcadia and 710-passenger Adonio will still be calling at the Falkland Islands capital Port Stanley.

An
 inside source said: ‘We worked through the night preparing for the mail
 drop. It could end up costing the company thousands if passengers 
decide to take up the offer of a refund.’

A referendum of 3,000 residents is set to be held in March to get their approval of its status as a British overseas territory.

Cunard spokesperson Michael Gallagher confirmed more ships are likely to be diverted, saying: ‘We will probably follow suit with P&O.’

America and Holland are also considering pulling their cruise liners out of Argentina.
