Residents of Norfolk Island are outraged by a request from the Australian Government asking them to use the Advance Australia Fair as their official national anthem, it has been claimed

Since Queen Victoria handed over control of the small island - off the coast of Australia - to Pitcairn islanders in 1856, the 2,000-strong population have been singing God Save the Queen to showcase their allegiance to the British monarchy.

But residents have refused to comply with the Australian Government's request that was made last month by its newly appointed administrator Gary Hardgrave, U.K. paper The Times reported.

Residents of Norfolk Island are outraged the Australian Government have asked them to stop using God Save the Queen as their official national anthem

In the ultimate act of revolt, attendees of the island's annual Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Show on Monday proudly belted out a rendition of God Save the Queen - with some brandishing the Union Jack flag.

Mr Hardgrave wrote to Norfolk Island Chief Minister Lisle Snell last month saying the act of singing God Save the Queen was 'surely wrong' as it had been '40 years since God Save the Queen was first replaced as the national anthem of the Commonwealth of Australia'.

But Mr Snell fired back at the administrator and wrote they were a nation of 'staunch monarchists', and had a long and binding history with the British royals.

In his letter of reply, Mr Snell protested against the change and flatly refused to adopt the move.

'Norfolk islanders in general regard their island as the homeland of descendants of the settlers from Pitcairn Island who, in 1856, were moved as a community to Norfolk Island, a community that came as a fully self-governing ethnic community with its own laws, language culture and traditions,' he wrote.

Mr Snell went on to say that it was a controversial matter and God Save the Queen had been the chosen anthem for many years, which was sung on days that paid tribute to the fallen soldiers of World War I and World War II. 

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Office of the Prime Minister in relation to this matter. 

Mr Hardgrave - a former Queensland Liberal National Party MP - was appointed in July as the 37th Administrator of Norfolk Island.

But it appears it has not been smooth sailing for the nation island - who usually enjoys its autonomy from Australia - since Mr Hardgrave took the post. 

In a Norfolk Island Government press release date October 9, Mr Snell accuses the Federal Government of taking away the nation's rights to self govern, which it has done for four years.

'I believe the Federal Government intends to impose on Norfolk Island a slightly modified Christmas Island model, which has proven to be dysfunctional, inoperable and does not allow for community representation and input above that of Local Government status as clearly identified by the recent Administrator of Christmas Island,' he said.

 

Norfolk Island is located more than 1,400km off the coast of New South Wales

After the British invasion of Australia in 1788, Norfolk Island - which was originally inhabited by East Polynesians - became a convict settlement.

It lay abandoned from 1814 to 1825 until it was decided by the then-Governor of NSW that the criminals who committed the most severe offences would be sent there due to its remote location.

Again the island was abandoned in 1853 and then re-inhabited when Tahitians and mutineers of HMS Bounty were sent to it when the Pitcairn Islands were no longer suitable for the size of the population.

Soon farming and whaling became sources of income for those living on the island.

Norfolk Island was given the right to govern as an external territory after the federation of Australia in 1901.

It was also used as an airbase and a refuelling station for planes during World War II.
