He confirmed to the world he's split from Vanessa Paradis after 14 years together earlier this week.

And Johnny Depp is ensuring he takes his mind off the break-up and intense scrutiny into his love life doing what he does best.

The Pirates of the Caribbean star has thrown himself back into work, attempting to hide from the crowds deep in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.

First sighting: Johnny Depp is spotted for the first time since announcing his split from Vanessa Paradis on set of The Lone Ranger in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado

Johnny, 49, was spotted in full character on set of The Lone Ranger yesterday.

He wore full Native American face paint with a headscarf and was shirtless as he walked along with a crew member.

The actor has been working steadily on the film and as yet has made no comment following recent events regarding his private life.

However, it seems that the problems for Depp are not confined to his personal life.

Filming on his next movie the Thin Man has been delayed. The remake of the 1934 comic detective film was set to star Depp as retired detective Nick Charles, with Rob Marshall directing.

But Deadline.com reports the studio are willing to put the project on hold so Depp can take a break, so Marshall has pulled out.

Also Warner Bros were said to have been unhappy with the box office performance of his last release the Tim Burton movie Dark Shadows, which only earned a slim profit margin following mixed reviews.

Since Depp's split from Vanessa was confirmed, revelations regarding the actor's closeness to other women have emerged.

Close: It's been reported that Johnny Depp and his publicist Robin Baum formed a relationship that went beyond work

Not only has it been reported that 
he's growing closer to his Rum Diary star Amber Heard, it's also being 
claimed that Depp was spending time with other beautiful women as his 14
year union with Paradis crumbled.

Be-Witched: Johnny described Dark Shadows co-star Eva Green as a 'different level of human'

Depp
was forced to deny rumours that he was involved with his Dark Shadows 
co-star Eva Green who he shared a sensational, supernatural love scene 
with in the Tim Burton film.

But a report suggests that he has struck up a more serious bond with his pretty publicist, Robin Baum.

'Robin and Johnny spend a lot of time together obviously because of work but their relationship seems to be getting much closer than just business,' a source told RadarOnline.com.

'Robin is twice divorced and a mom but she and Johnny really seem to have some kind of crazy connection that goes way beyond a professional level.

'They travel a lot together for work and get to spend a lot of time together and they definitely have a total flirty vibe between them. I would put money on them having more than just a friendly relationship.'

They added that Johnny's French 
partner Paradis was aware of the close relationship between her partner 
and Robin... and wasn't happy about it.

'She
knew that Johnny and Robin were together a lot and she didn’t like it, 
but there was nothing she could do because it was a working relationship
she was told,' the source said.

But
currently, bisexual actress Heard, 26, is a 'regular visitor' to the 
New Mexico set of The Lone Ranger where Depp is currently filming.

And
Johnny, who made an official 
announcement that he had split from partner of 14 years Vanessa Paradis 
on Tuesday, is even said to have bought Heard a horse so they can ride 
together, according to a report in Globe magazine.

A source claims Depp is smitten by 
the Hitchcock blonde, and reportedly said: 'When I first saw Amber, it 
was like seeing an old-time movie star like Lauren Bacall.'

The American actress who was born in Austin, Texas, previously worked as a model and before starring in The Rum Diary, had had small roles in a number of films.

She attended a Catholic school in Austin until her junior year, then the ambitious teen left to pursue a career in Hollywood.

Heard was active in her school's drama department and appeared in local commercials and campaigns.

While she was raised a Catholic, after the death of her best friend died in a car crash Heard declared herself an atheist.

Heard has described her role as Johnny Depp's love interest in the film, The Rum Diary, as 'the best experience of my life'.

She gushed to magazine Dazed about Depp: 'He’s such a wonderful presence; he is enigmatic and compelling and a true artist, seriously intelligent and incredibly sensitive.

'Everybody on set respects and likes him, which says a lot about an actor. It’s a gruelling job at times and the stress level that everybody feels in the industry is intense – but it doesn’t affect Johnny.

'It seems like he has time to look everybody in the eye and I like that, it was wonderful to see.'

The 26-year-old actress's profile is 
set to rise as she recently joined the case of  thriller Paranoia as the
female lead alongside Gary 
Oldman, Harrison Ford, and Liam Hemsworth. 

She also recently 
landed a role as an assassin in the sequel Machete Kills.

Vanessa and Johnny had not been 
pictured together in public for months, but the Dark Shadows star 
insisted last month that there was no truth to talk of a split.

'The rumours are not true,' he told The Sun newspaper. 'They are absolutely not true.'

'No matter what I say about this, people believe the opposite. I can’t say enough about it not being over,' he said.

It's over: Depp's spokesperson finally ended months of speculation by revealing that Depp and Paradis, seen here in 2010, had split

Despite
Johnny's denials, a number of publications carried pictures and reports
that he and Heard enjoyed a trip together to Las Vegas on a private
plane.

Depp was in town promoting Dark Shadows, and Vanessa was nowhere to be seen.

It's unclear why Amber was in the gambling town.

Amber was alleged to have joined Johnny in Vegas, and was pictured boarding his private plane the next day.

Johnny and Vanessa have declined to appear at their respective premieres and public events together recently, with the French actress attending her premiere, of Café de Flore in Paris alone, and not accompanying the actor on promotional duties for Dark Shadows.

They are parents to Lily Rose,12, and ten-year-old Jack.
