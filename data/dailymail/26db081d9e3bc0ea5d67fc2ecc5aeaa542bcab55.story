After five months of undergoing treatment for cancer, Cincinnati Bengals player Devon Still's daughter will finally get to watch her father play in person for the first time on Thursday night.

Since 4-year-old Leah was diagnosed with stage 4 Neuroblastoma in June, the defensive tackle has been immersed in helping her get through surgery and chemotherapy to fight the cancerous growth found in her abdomen.

She's feeling good enough to leave a hospital back home in Philadelphia and fly to Cincinnati for a game on Thursday night against the Cleveland Browns at Paul Brown Stadium, where she'll get to watch her father play for the first time.

Leah is hoping he'll do the robot dance just for her.

‘I got to do something for her,’ the third-year player from Penn State told WCPO. ‘You got to make a play. You can't just be out there dancing for no reason.’

After the first quarter of the game, Leah is expected to be part of a ceremony in which the team presents a check to Cincinnati Children's Hospital for more than $1 million to go toward pediatric cancer research.

The team raised money from sales of Still's jersey, No. 75, which sold out, according to the team's website.

‘All the money that's been raised for the cancer research is because of her strength and because she's fighting this disease. So it's definitely going to be an emotional game for me.’

The Bengals (5-2-1) helped Still and his daughter by excusing him from offseason activities so he could spend time with her in Philadelphia. They kept him on the practice squad to start the season even though he was hurt so that he'd keep his medical coverage.

‘It's going to be added motivation just knowing my daughter is watching me,’ Still said.

‘I want her to be able to hear how the crowd cheers that loud whenever I make a tackle, so I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to put a smile on her face.’

It will be a special night for the team, Bengals spokesman Jeff Berding said at a news conference.

"It's a little extra special because we have Leah Still in the house," Berding said. "There's been a tremendous amount of support from the community and across the country to support her and Devon Still and their fight against pediatric cancer."

Fighting: Still posted a video of himself giving Leah a peptalk ahead of major surgery, which then went viral
