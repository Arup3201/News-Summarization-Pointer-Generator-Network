A campaign to buy prosthetic limbs for a super-fit mother-of-two who lost both legs after getting pneumonia at Christmas has topped £85,000 in just five days.

The tragic story of Tracy Ralph has inspired more than 2,000 donations from members of the public, while also capturing the hearts of celebrities including Alan Carr, Robbie Savage and Deborah Meaden.

Mrs Ralph, who turned 35 on Wednesday, fell desperately ill on Christmas Eve and had to have her lower legs and fingers amputated after being hit by pneumonia.

Tracey Ralph had to have her lower legs and fingers amputated after suffering multiple organ failure and developing septicaemia after coming down with pneumonia shortly before Christmas

The mother, of Hawkwell, Essex, is a keen runner who was training for a half marathon when she reported feeling short of breath of December 24.

She was found to be suffering from pneumonia and her condition rapidly deteriorated over the following days.

After being put into a medically-induced coma on Christmas Day, she has since battled multiple organ failure, meningitis, septicaemia, blood clots and bleeding on the brain.

Tragically Mrs Ralph, who has two sons aged four and 19-months, had to have her fingers and legs amputated below the knee.

She came out of her coma on New Year's Eve, but is still in intensive care in St Thomas's hospital, London.  

Desperate to give her the best chance of leading a normal life again, her sister-in-law Amanda Ralph set up a fundraising campaign to help with her rehabilitation and buy the best prosthetic limbs possible.

The mother-of-two's family, including husband Brad and sons Miller and Hudson, didn't realise just how ill she was before she was suddenly rushed to hospital on Christmas Eve

And in just five days, Amanda's £100,000 goal is in reach, after donations topped £85,000 today.

Speaking to The Mirror, she said: 'Tracy's husband Brad is overwhelmed by all the acts of kindness and generosity. He is still trying to come to terms with Tracy's situation.' 

Pneumonia is a swelling of the lung tissue, usually caused by an infection. Early symptoms include a phlegmy cough, fever or difficulty breathing.

Mild cases can be treated with antibiotics but more serious cases, which can be exacerbated by underlying health problems, can lead to more serious complications.

If left untreated, oxygen levels in the heart and brain can fall, leading to confusion, coma and organ failure, which can  be fatal.

Pneumonia can also lead to septicaemia, which can in turn mean amputations are needed.  

'We decided to start fundraising because we want to give Tracy what she needs.

'The house will need to be renovated, she'll need prosthetics, an adapted car, a wheelchair, support from carers - we have no idea how much that's going to cost.'

Speaking earlier in the week, Amanda said: 'The first we knew anything was seriously wrong was when she couldn't breathe and she had to be rushed to Southend Hospital in an ambulance on Christmas Eve.

'We have been living through it, it has almost been an out of body experience, there has been no good news at all.

'We were close to losing her before she got transferred to London, the doctors said she might not make it at one point.' 

Tracy's husband Brad, 37, has been at her side throughout the ordeal, but he has kept their children, four-year-old Miller and 19-month-old Hudson, away until their mother is up to seeing them. 

Her family have now set up a fundraising campaign to pay for her rehabilitation when she is out of hospital

Speaking about the fundraising campaign, her sister-in-law added: 'It's really humbling, we were up to nearly £18,000 in less than 24 hours.

'It just proves that Tracy is such a beautiful, lovely and caring person that so many people want to help her out.

'We have had people who didn't even know Tracy contributing and those saying they can't afford much but giving what they can.

'We know that when she comes out of hospital she is going to need a lot of help.

Touched by her story: Ex-footballer Robbie Savage and TV presenter Alan Carr (R) have both donated money to help Tracy Ralph afford the best prosthetic limbs possible

'Every penny will help Tracy and we are so grateful to everyone who has donated, we are raising the money for her rehab and ultimately the best prosthetic feet we can buy.'

Mrs Ralph, who works for Clarins at Debenhams in Southend, had been training to run the Southend Half Marathon later this year and had been training with the Essex Ladies Running Club before becoming ill.

A fellow member has now taken her spot and will donate everything she raises to Tracy's cause.
