'Beloved husband': Captain Jeff Haney died when his F22 Raptor crashed during a routine test mission in 2010

The widow of a U.S. fighter pilot killed when his multi-million dollar F22 Raptor plane malfunctioned has said the cowardly 'incompetence' of the Defense Department and its private contractors is to blame for her husband's death.

The Air Force had said pilot error was behind the crash that claimed the life of Captain Jeff Haney during a routine training mission in the $420million plane in November 2010, but his family always maintained he was not at fault.

Now Captain Haney's wife Anna has publicly lashed out at the Defense Department and its 'inferior equipment' after a Pentagon report concluded the Air Force did not have the facts to support its claim.

Mrs Haney, said the publication of 
the report from the Pentagon's Inspector General this week had simply 
confirmed 'what we knew all along'.

'....
The cause of the death of my beloved husband and the father of my 
children was not pilot error, it was incompetence by the Defense 
Department and its contractors,' she told ABC News.

'The
F22 is not ready to serve its country, but my husband Jeffrey Haney was
and he gave his life to demonstrate that brave men will serve while the
cowards in the military-industrial complex systematically loot our 
Treasury to build inferior equipment upon which our servicemen and women
stake their lives every day.'

Mrs Haney's emotional statement was her first since her husband's death in 2010.

Haney died during a routine training flight in Alaska when his plane 
malfunctioned and his oxygen system shut down completely.

He did not 
make a distress call but took the plane into a dive and crashed into the
wilderness a little over a minute later.

The Air Force released an Accident Investigation Board (AIB) report after a lengthy investigation which said that, while the pilot was likely to have suffered a 'sense similar to suffocation' before his death, he was still to blame for the crash because he was too distracted to properly fly the plane.

The report suggested he may have been struggling to activate the manual emergency oxygen back-up system. After breaking her silence, Mrs Haney described how she told the Air Force official who informed her of the reports findings in 2011 he 'should be ashamed'.

The pilot's family have always disputed the findings of the December 2011 report.

Captain Haney's sister previously said the Air Force was more concerned with protecting its multi-billion dollar fleet of F22s than its pilots.

'To them, Jeff was just a number, it feels like sometimes. But those jets are worth a lot of money,' Jennifer Haney said last year.

In March 2012 the late pilot's wife filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Lockheed Martin, the F22's primary manufacturer, and other firms involved in its production, which alleged they knowingly supplied the Air Force with a dangerous aircraft. Neither the Air Force nor the Department of Defense were named in the action.

ABC News said the suit was settled under undisclosed terms last August, shortly after the broadcaster made inquiries with Lockheed Martin and the Air Force about an internal memo flagging up a design flaw in the F22's oxygen system a decade before Captain Haney's death.
