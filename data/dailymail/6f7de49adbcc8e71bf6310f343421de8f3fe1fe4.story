Aged only 60 minutes, Keira Robertson had suffered more than most people do in a lifetime.

Not only had her heart stopped beating for 25 minutes, she then needed surgery as doctors battled to save her.

Her parents, Michaela and Christopher, had earlier been warned she was unlikely to survive beyond 21 weeks in the womb.

They were told that as well as having four major heart defects, their unborn child had a high risk of cystic fibrosis and Down’s syndrome.

Survivor: Miracle baby Keira Robertson, aged seven-months, from Brechin, Angus, died for 25 minutes before she was revived by doctors and underwent life-saving heart surgery - all before she was an hour old

In hospital: Keira Robertson was just nine minutes old when her heart stopped beating. Doctors worked for 25 minuted until they finally revived her

Despite the warnings, Mrs Robertson, from Brechin, Angus, rejected advice to terminate her pregnancy and when Keira was delivered ‘pink and screaming’ a week early, the couple could not have been happier.

However, only nine minutes later Keira’s heart stopped. When doctors finally managed to revive her, she needed two heart operations – after 40 minutes of life and at eight days old – and a week of hypothermia treatment to reverse any brain damage.

But having survived her gruelling start to life, Keira is a happy, smiling seven-month-old baby and taking on her next challenge – learning to crawl.

Mrs Robertson, 23, said: ‘She’s amazing, She’s doing everything she should be doing for a seven-month-old. She’s sitting up and rolling, quicker than her brothers did. And she doesn’t have Down’s syndrome or cystic fibrosis.

‘At my 20-week scan they gave me three weeks to decide whether to continue with the pregnancy.

‘They said she wouldn’t make it past 21 weeks in the womb. But I wasn’t giving up on her, I decided to carry on.

‘Every week were told the pros and cons but I ignored it, I knew she’d be OK. And she’s proved them all wrong.’

Through
a routine scan half-way through her pregnancy Mrs Robertson – who is 
also mother to Kaiden, four, and Bayley, two – discovered that Keira’s 
arteries were transposed. She also had two holes in her heart and 
narrowing of the pulmonary valves.

The combination of these problems meant there was limited blood being pumped around her body or to the lungs.

For the remainder of her pregnancy Mrs Robertson received growth scans and was told that Keira would weigh only about 4lb at birth.

Her delivery by caesarean section at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow on March 28 took more than two hours because of Keira’s position.

Mrs Robertson said: ‘The surgeon actually lifted me off the operating table with the force needed to pull the baby out.’

But when Keira finally arrived she weighed in at a healthy 8lb 5oz.

The plan was to transfer her to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, Glasgow, within 24 hours.

Lucky to be alive: Doctors had believed it was unlikely Keira would survive beyond 21 weeks in the womb

Mrs Robertson recalled: ‘When she came out she was pink and was screaming, but at nine minutes old her heart stopped and she passed away for 25 minutes.

‘The doctors came down and told us that things weren’t looking too good and she probably won’t make it.

‘I just sat there in shock. My mum and my husband sat there crying, but I just didn’t register what they were saying.’

Doctors massaged the newborn’s heart to try to keep the blood pumping and she was given five doses of adrenaline to re-start it.

Just as medics were on the verge of giving up, Keira’s heart began to beat a minute after the final attempt to resuscitate her.

Mrs Robertson said: ‘They had been trying for so long that they said it would have been better to let her go.

‘But after 24 minutes they gave it one last attempt and she pulled through.’

Minutes later, when she was only 40 minutes old, doctors carried out an emergency operation to keep the arteries in her heart open.

Her body temperature was cooled to 24c (75f) in an attempt to reverse any brain damage as it had been starved of oxygen for so long.

At eight days old she had a ten-hour open heart operation to correct her arteries, two holes in her heart and widen the pulmonary valves.

Her body temperature was gradually brought back up to the normal body temperature of 37c (98.6f).Mrs Robertson said: ‘After the operation we finally got to see her, although nothing prepared us for seeing our poor girl’s chest wounds and dressings.

‘But a few days later she opened her eyes for the first time, aged two weeks, and I finally got to hold her.  It was such an emotional day.’

Despite all that happened, Mrs Robertson said it was not until she got home that she cried: ‘I stood there and broke down.’

She added: ‘I never thought we’d be looking forward to spending Christmas with her.’

She added: ‘To look at Keira you wouldn’t think she has been through everything that she has. She‘s as healthy as can be.’
