Two British soldiers shot dead last week in Afghanistan may have been the victims of a revenge attack by local police.

Corporal Channing Day, 25, of 3 Medical Regiment and Corporal David O’Connor, 27, of 40 Com-mando, Royal Marines, were previously thought to have been caught up in a so-called ‘friendly fire’ incident.

But after interviewing witnesses and recovering fragments of ammunition, Royal Military Police investigators have ruled out the theory that the pair were shot by British Forces.

Last night a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman confirmed that the deaths were caused by ‘a third party... not UK personnel’.

Military detectives are exploring whether the soldiers were killed after British troops shot dead an Afghan policeman.

And Defence Secretary Philip Hammond –
asked whether the British personnel had been killed in a ‘green on 
blue’ attack, when Afghan personnel turn on their British partners – 
said: ‘There is a possibility that that is what has happened but it is 
not clear at this stage.’

On Wednesday morning, Cpl Day and Cpl O’Connor were patrolling through the district of Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand Province.

Military sources say that when the 
patrol reached the village of Char Kutsa they saw an Afghan male 
crouching on the bank of a stream. The man was shot dead and later 
identified as a local police officer.

An Army source said: ‘The man wasn’t wearing a uniform, so there was no way of knowing he was an off-duty policeman.

‘It now seems that he was washing, a 
ritual before conducting daily prayers. If the soldiers saw him with a 
weapon he might have been mistaken for Taliban.

‘The investigation is focusing on the reasons for the decision to open fire and what happened next.

‘Other Afghan police or villagers 
reacted badly to this mistaken shooting, believing they were all under 
attack. The situation was messy and confusing.’

The Ministry spokeswoman added: ‘Further investigation into the involvement or otherwise of the dead Afghan male is on-going.

‘Analysis of the events surrounding 
this complex incident continues and is likely to take some time while 
forensic and other tests are carried out.’

Channing Day harboured a schoolgirl dream of joining the Army, a teacher at her former school said.

As a bubbly and sporty teenager in Northern Ireland she completed work experience with the forces in 2002 and worked well with everybody there, Strangford College acting principal Paul Maxwell added.

She was always physically fit and achieved top grades in PE, excelling at gymnastics, trampolining and netball.

Mr Maxwell said: 'She always said she wanted to join the Army, she was pretty much focused on wanting to join the Army.'

He said her sporting prowess revealed her gritty determination to succeed.

'It was not just that she was good but that she always showed commitment, she stayed after school and did all the practice,' he added.

Ms Day left school at 16 and Mr Maxwell said he believed she went straight into the Army.

The acting principal added: 'Every pupil is dear to us and I can remember Channing as if it was yesterday, somebody we remember as being young, and still so young, is suddenly killed in such a tragic way.'

Cpl Day, from County Down, Northern 
Ireland, was the third female member of British Forces to be killed on 
operations in Afghanistan.

Colleagues considered her a rising star and 
she was an outstanding sportswoman.

She joined the Army in 2005 and 
deployed to Helmand Province at the beginning of October.

She had completed previous tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Cpl O’Connor, from Havant, Hampshire, was on his third tour of Afghanistan having joined the Royal Marines in 2002.

He had deployed to Helmand at the end of September.

A total of 435 British military personnel have been killed in Afghanistan since operations started in 2001.

Yesterday Cpl Day’s sister, Lauren, said there were no words to describe the sadness felt by her family in Comber, County Down.

She said: ‘We are an extremely close family and this has hit us all hard.

‘Channing loved the Army.

If there 
was one thing she knew growing up, it was that she wanted to be a 
soldier – she would march around the living room and never missed 
cadets.

‘Channing grew up into the bravest, beautiful, determined woman.

‘She has done more in her 25 years than most women her age and we are so very proud of everything she  has achieved.
