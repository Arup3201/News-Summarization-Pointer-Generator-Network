'Concerned': Foreign Secretary William Hague today said Britain 'should be concerned' about the activities of North Korea

William Hague has urged everyone to remain ‘calm’ in the face of ‘paranoid rhetoric’ coming out of North Korea.The Foreign Secretary said scaremongering by Pyongyang amounted to an authoritarian government trying to justify to its own starving people why it had missiles but no tractors.He said there was little evidence of the sort of military build-up that would be expected ahead of a major conflict.His call for caution came as the US defence secretary Chuck Hagel said he would delay testing a missile from a California airbase until next month to reduce tensions.Mr Hague said: ‘We have to be concerned about the danger of miscalculation by the North Korean regime, which has worked itself up into this frenetic state of rhetoric in recent weeks, and the danger that they would believe their own paranoid rhetoric.

'But it is important that the international response to this, including our response, must be clear and united and calm.” He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show that leader Kim Jong-un’s behaviour was typical of authoritarian leaders who were keen to justify the need to arm themselves in the face of an external threat.‘What is going on here could easily be what we have often seen throughout history among authoritarian and totalitarian regimes.

'Remember that this is a regime that has to justify the intense militarisation of their society and the development of these weapons and missiles, even though many people in their country are regularly and seriously short even of food,’ Mr Hague said.

'Threat': Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show today, Mr Hague said there was a threat to the world 'from any country breaching the non-proliferation treaty, which North Korea is doing'

‘To justify that you have to have an external threat ... or danger you can point to.’ 
Pyongyang’s warning last week that it could not guarantee the safety of 
foreign embassy staff from this coming Wednesday was consistent with 
that, he said.

But Britain has refused to withdraw embassy staff from the peninsula, signalling that it believes it is all a bluff.

Mr Hague warned North Korea that it would remain ‘isolated’ and without 
friends if it continued to build up missiles while its citizens went 
hungry.

‘There is an enormous gap. This is a country where many people are 
working in the field. It is a case of manual labour in the fields 
without many tractors - so they are short of tractors. But they do have 
the machines that carry long-range and intermediate-range missiles 
around.

He added: ‘If the leadership of North Korea continue on their current 
path over the coming months and years, they will end up leading a broken
 country that is internationally isolated.’ 

At the weekend, the US announced it would suspend a ballistic missile test in the region to avoid any ‘miscalculation’.

Meanwhile, China yesterday distanced itself from its North Korea ally.

Chinese President Xi Jinping, addressing a forum on the southern island 
of Hainan, said no country 'should be allowed to throw a region and even
 the whole world into chaos for selfish gain', in apparent reference to 
North Korea.

Last night, South Korea said its neighbour was still planning to test a missile or engage in a provocative act.

A top security official added, however that the North’s clearest 
objective was to extract concessions from Washington and Seoul Kim 
Jang-Soo said the notice to diplomats could be an attempt to force 
America to offer dialogue.

It is believed that North Korea could launch a Musudam missile which could strike American bases in Guam, some 2,490 miles away.

Switzerland - where the young Kim Jong-un was educated - has offered to mediate as tensions escalate on the Korean peninsula.
