Jailed: Valerie Bell, pictured outside Newcastle Crown Court, hit an 89-year-old patient with slippers, forced a can of deodorant in her mouth, and called her a 'flithy animal'

A care home worker has been jailed after it was discovered she hit a patient with slippers and forced a can of deodorant into her mouth.

Valerie Bell also sprayed her victim, who has dementia, in the face and called her a 'filthy animal' when she was meant to be caring for her.

The 51-year-old's campaign of abuse was eventually stopped when two other carers who worked for Bell blew the whistle on their boss.

Bell was sentenced to nine months in prison after she was convicted of four counts of ill-treatment or neglect, relating to two residents at Sutherland Court Care Home, in Fenham.

Judge John Milford, at Newcastle Crown Court, told her: 'The serious
aspect of this sort of offending is the victims can’t protect 
themselves, they are entirely dependant on the care of those who are 
charged with looking after them.'

Bell was accused of offences against nine elderly residents at 
Sutherland Court but was only convicted with regard to two of them.

She worked a permanent night shift at the care home and was in charge of a floor where elderly dementia suffers were housed.

Bell had worked in the industry for 18 years and was regarded as a senior figure at Sutherland Court.

However,
two other care workers, Victoria Rooks and Melanie Ledger, were 
appalled at how Bell treated residents and eventually revealed all.

Judge Milford said the abuse had not been reported straight away because the two other carers were afraid of the consequences.

The women told how, on August 19 last year, an 89-year-old woman was heard screaming in her room at around 5am.

Bell
and Mrs Rooks went to the woman's room and found she had wet the bed. 
She was lifted out of bed and wheeled into a shower, where water was 
sprayed onto her chest without Bell testing it’s temperature and she 
complained it was too hot.

Bell then placed the shower head against the resident’s bottom lip, as the elderly woman screamed.

The woman was then wheeled back to her room where the defendant struck her three times round the face with a slipper.

Mrs Rooks told the court that the attack had hurt the pensioner and described it as a 'full-blown whack' which left a red mark.

Mrs Rooks recorded audio from part of the incident on her phone and the pensioner could be heard screaming and crying.

Judge
Milford said: 'The recording makes chilling listening, it’s clear you 
lost your temper with her and she was manhandled back into bed.'

Mrs Rooks said Bell made it clear she did not like the victim, saying she was 'not one of my favourites'.

The
court was told that Bell also subjected the 89-year-old to another 
ordeal, spraying deodorant in her face and calling her a 'filthy 
animal'.

On that  occasion, last spring, she went to the 
pensioner’s room after she wet the bed, and as she put her on the 
commode the pensioner spat at her.

Care: Helen McArdle Care, which operates Sutherland Court, said Bell's behaviour was not tolerated and that 'justice has prevailed' for residents and their families

Bell called her a 'filthy 
animal', slapped her arm and sprayed deodorant in her face, the court 
heard. The  woman was screaming loudly and Bell pushed the can into her 
mouth sideways three times as a gag.

Bell was convicted of three counts of ill treatment or neglect of a person who lacks capacity with regard to the 89-year-old.

She was also found guilty of the same offence against another resident, an 84-year-old woman described as 'frail'.

The court heard that one morning, at around 5.30 or 6am, the 84-year-old had been woken up by Bell and ordered to hurry up.

She was then put in a wheelchair and banged her head when Bell tipped her backwards.

After a trial Bell was cleared of two counts of assault against two other residents and acquitted of five further counts of ill-treatment against other residents.

Tom Finch, defending, said: 'She had worked in the care industry for 18 years with an unblemished character and committed many many years to caring for the elderly and vulnerable.

'What happened was a momentary lapse of patience and tolerance at times when the circumstances were particularly stressful.'

A spokesperson for Helen McArdle Care, which operates the home, said: 'We do not tolerate behaviour of this kind in our care homes and justice has prevailed for our residents and their families.'
