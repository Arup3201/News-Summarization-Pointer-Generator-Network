Residents in a street in Bangor, Maine, have got themselves in such a flap over birds appearing on their street that authorities have had to step in with an ordinance to limit out of control bird-feeding.

Some residents  of Drew Lane in Bangor like to feed bird seed to the pigeons that regularly congregate around their homes.

However others say the creatures are a plague that leave droppings and feathers and cause disruption around the area.

Besieged: Residents of Drew Lane in Bangor have to clean piles of pigeon poop off their cars each morning to prevent the corrosive droppings damaging the paint jobs on their cars

After 'angry exchanges' and years of 
neighborhood clashes over the issue authorities have now stepped in - 
warning the feeders that they face fines of up to $200. 

Resident Steve Coleman, who is legally blind, is in the anti-bird camp. 

'My deck gets nailed all the time,' Coleman told Bangor Daily News.

Others claim they have to clean their vehicles every day as piles of corrosive pigeon poop build up, damaging the paintwork.

John Bruneel says verbal exchanges over the issue have taken place over the years leading to authorities need to weigh in.

They say one particular unnamed man is responsible.

Neighbors say he dumps piles of birdseed on his driveway every morning, leaving the atmosphere filled with floating feathers and houses, cars and driveways caked in pigeon droppings.

Drew Lane residents had ended up with a 
situation reminiscent to Hitchcock's 'The Birds', and felt there was little choice 
but to take the matter to the City Council.

Bruneel and Coleman spoke about their
ordeal at a Government Operations Committee in May to plead with the 
city to do something about the bird feeding in Drew Lane.

The City Council passed an ordinance 
in May 29 that prohibits people from feeding birds or other animals in a
way that creates a 'disturbance or unsanitary condition.'

'The sheer number of birds located around Drew Lane at some times is pretty out of control,' Assistant City Solicitor Paul Nicklas told Bangor Daily News.

Fines for violating the ordinance begin at $50 for the first offense, then $100 and $200 for subsequent offenses within a year.

Bruneel and Coleman are likely to be hailed neighborhood heroes for the ordinance, which will bring relief to Drew Lane residents, with perhaps one exception.

'I’m just glad the city stepped in and did something about this,' Bruneel said.

Coleman, himself a bird-lover, says he's looking forward to the neighborhood returning to normal and living in Drew Lane 'without this issue hanging over our heads.'

The marauding birds won't go hungry, and it's likely the flock will spread its wing and disperse to other areas of the city and leave Drew Lane residents to enjoy a pigeon-poop-free existence.
