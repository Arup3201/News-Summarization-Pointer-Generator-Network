Those who watched the Prince of Wales embellish his credentials as the defender of the countryside in a special edition of Countryfile on BBC1 at the weekend will have been impressed by his love of all things rural.

They will have noted his fervour as he spoke of the importance of protecting the countryside for future generations.

But his words sounded rather hollow this week to some country folk living near the Prince’s experimental new town of  Poundbury in the most beautiful part of Dorset.

Hard-y words: The royal proposal to build on the field near author Thomas Hardy's home, owned by The Prince of Wales, pictured yesterday during his visit to Jordan, has outraged Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes

For royal aides are evaluating the prospect of building another small town on a vast cornfield.

However, this isn’t just any old cornfield. It is the one that forms a spectacular valley at the centre of Thomas Hardy country and is overlooked by the author’s former home, Max Gate, now owned by the National Trust.

It is also the very same field Hardy describes in lyrical detail in many of his novels.

The proposal has outraged Downton Abbey creator Lord Julian Fellowes, who lives nearby and is president of the Thomas Hardy Society.

He tells me: ‘I am absolutely sure that the Prince of Wales, of all people, would be horrified.

‘The Prince loves the countryside like nobody else. Everyone has been jumping up and down about this locally. It’s the most beautiful swooping cornfield, which goes down into a dip and then up to a wood on the far side. I just don’t believe Charles has been made aware of any of this.’

The valley is jointly owned by the Prince and a local landowner who, I understand, has no wish to see the land developed.

But Charles’s Duchy of Cornwall, which owns 66 acres of the 103-acre site, is about to employ experts to look at the feasibility of building up to 1,000 houses — a proposal bound to provoke fierce local opposition.

It comes after West Dorset District Council informed the Duchy it wants to include the area in its draft housing plan.

‘The council has put forward a proposal to develop this land and we are undertaking a feasibility assessment,’ says a Duchy spokeswoman. ‘It is our duty to assist.’

That assistance, of course, could potentially earn Prince Charles around £50 million.

Crime writer Minette Walters, who lives nearby, says: ‘They want to stick something half the size of Poundbury in front of Max Gate. Hardy’s house will disappear from view.’

Surrounded by his family, including daughter Holly, 31, it should  have been the jolliest of occasions for Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson as they celebrated publication of his remarkable mother Eve’s memoir, Mum’s The Word.

But what was on the tycoon’s mind was the reputation of the Duchess of Cambridge, someone he considers to be a friend.

Branson had remained silent throughout the furore when Booker prize-winning author Hilary Mantel described Kate as  a ‘shop window mannequin’ with no personality, whose only purpose was to breed.

No bad word: Kate is 'well-informed and intelligent'

But when the panel game show presenter and comedienne Sandi Toksvig  accused the Duchess of having no opinions, Sir Richard felt this was the last straw.

‘Miss Toksvig is so wrong,’ he tells me. ‘I know Kate, and this is not the person I know.

‘We’ve been on family holidays together.

'I can say with conviction that she is well-informed, very intelligent and wonderful company.’

Speaking at the women-only Grace Belgravia club, Sir Richard adds: ‘Kate certainly has strong opinions about a whole range of subjects.

‘But because she is a member of the Royal Family, she simply cannot express these opinions.

‘She certainly doesn’t deserve this criticism. It is just inaccurate.

‘And coming from a comedienne? Please!’

ITV bosses are despairing over viewing figures for Daybreak relaunched six months ago.

Hosted by Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones, it is attracting around 700,000, less than half the audience of rival BBC Breakfast and way short of the one million target they set.

But might there be a solution close at hand?

Refreshing change: Kate Garraway's stint on Daybreak brought figures up

For what has not been reported is that Daybreak did come close to a million viewers on one day during the February half-term week when Kate Garraway and John Stapleton stood in for Lorraine and Jones.

It's true a strike by some BBC staff affected Breakfast Time. But it has sparked speculation that mother-of-two Kate, who already presents Daybreak on Fridays as well as standing in for Kelly during her holidays, will appear more often.

The programme has floundered since replacing GMTV in 2010. Big money signings Christine Bleakley and Adrian Chiles have come and gone, and at one stage ratings fell as low as 300,000.

Broadcasting belle Kate, of course, is a veteran of 13 years of breakfast telly, while the excellent John Stapleton has been around longer than me.

It is a debilitating illness that she likens to a hammer blow every 15 minutes to her knees, back, shoulders and hips.

This is how singer and actress Toyah Willcox describes the ‘peculiar virus’ she’s been suffering for the past three months.

Her symptoms have been so painful that she has had to undergo daily physiotherapy at a sports injury centre. But despite her illness, she has just started a nationwide tour of a play, Hormonal Housewives. ‘Bizarrely, I know four other people with the same symptoms — they all live locally.’

Her husband, rocker Robert Fripp, has also developed the virus.

She tells fans on her blog: ‘Weight loss is the main concern. I’ve dropped about a stone and lost muscle tone.’

Happily, she is improving, and adds: ‘This is mainly due to the fact I went back to work and didn’t stay at home feeling sorry for myself.’

Actor Sir Michael Caine, who is 80 tomorrow, tells his Twitter followers: ‘Thank you for your kind birthday messages. Will blow the candles off.’  Fans will recall his famous line from the 1969 comedy film The Italian Job: ‘You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!’

He's played some of the great theatrical roles, from Hamlet to Uncle Vanya. But veteran thespian Sir Derek Jacobi admits one opportunity has eluded him — Coronation Street.

Taking a break from filming ITV sitcom Vicious, in which he plays Sir Ian McKellen’s boyfriend, Jacobi, 74, says: ‘I’d love to do Corrie. Ian has been on it and I’m so jealous.

‘They haven’t had anyone  playing a professional actor yet, so maybe my character could have a room in Emily’s house while he’s doing a local gig.’

Despite President Francois Hollande’s plans to impose draconian soak-the-rich taxes, actress Kristen Scott Thomas will not be deserting her beloved France.

But The English Patient star — in London yesterday to present a theatre gong at the Sky Arts South Bank Show Awards — does retain a residual loyalty.

‘I was planning to cheer for France at the Six Nations game against England,’ she says.

‘But then I heard God Save The Queen and I was on my feet. I was welling up. The National Anthem does it for me.’
