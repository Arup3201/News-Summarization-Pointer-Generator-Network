The US transport police have strict rules about prohibited hand luggage items.

But judging by the photographs it has posted on Instagram, they regularly discover extremely dangerous weapons - being concealed in a number of inventive ways.

From knives disguised as keys and hidden within zimmer frames to a hand grenade found stuffed into a toy penguin.

Recently, a Samurai sword was discovered in a carry-on bag at the Boston Logan 
International Airport and a knife was found under the insole of a shoe at Detroit Metropolitan Airport.

After its annual review, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) released a shocking list of weapons confiscated from passengers trying to board planes in the past year.

The deadly haul of weapons included maces, fake suicide vests and an assortment of concealed guns and knives.

Officers discovered the assortment of guns and knives as they screened 638,705,790 passengers at airports across the US.

And criminals are coming up with more and more inventive ways to conceal weaponry. In 2012, a knife was discovered mounted to a walker at the Newark International Airport in New Jersey.

Guns were the most frequently confiscated item, with 1,813 firearms - roughly five a day - found during passenger checks at 205 airports.

More worryingly, the TSA said that in about 80 per cent of cases, the guns were loaded.

The largest number were found at Atlanta's international airport, with Dallas/Fort Worth International coming in second, according to the Huffington Post.

In one case officers found a .380 pistol, loaded with eight rounds, that had been strapped to the lower leg of a passenger.

At Boston Logan airport, an alarm on a checked bag alerted officers to a disassembled 30-30 rifle concealed in the bag lining. When they ran checks on the serial number they discovered it had been stolen.

A shotgun was also found in a checked golf bag in Detroit, and seven undeclared firearms were found in a toolbox in Miami.

As well as guns, passengers were also found to have stun guns, shock grenades, flare guns, inert demolition devices and, in one case, a Second World War bazooka, in their carry on bags.

At Chicago's Midway International, TSA officials even found a medieval wood and metal mace.

Often seemingly innocent looking items such as pens, combs and walking stalks were found to conceal an array of knives and swords.

And cigarette packets and lipsticks were used to try to conceal stun guns and pepper spray.

The discovery of a suicide vest shocked one group of officers. It was found to be deactivated and belonged to an explosives instructor.Â
