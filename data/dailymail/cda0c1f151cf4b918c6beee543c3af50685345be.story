When a wedding reception organiser decided to help out two hard-up friends by laying on a half price champagne buffet, the least she could have expected was a thank you.

Instead, the bridegroom decided to repay the kindness by vandalising and stealing from the venue - leaving the owner with a £60,000 bill.

Catherine Murphy, 34, decided to help out hard-up Bridie Sparks, 24, and her husband to be Christopher Richards, by laying on the half-price champagne buffet for 90 guests.

Woes: Bride-to-be Bridie Sparks told the venue owner that she and fiance Chris Richards were short of money

Big day: The couple look thrilled as they say their vows in front of friends at the venue

The bride-to-be had approached the 
owner of the Bacup Hub in Lancashire in tears, and explained how the 
couple would be unable to get married because they did not have enough 
money.

But 
after mother-of-two Ms Murphy decided to put on the discounted reception, unemployed 
Richards, 25, and his usher George Taylor, 23, returned to the venue and
carried out a sickening late night raid.

Caring: Venue owner Catherine Murphy burst into tears when she had who had robbed her

CCTV cameras captured the ungrateful 
pair, along with four others, stealing cash, champagne, beer and wine 
from the community centre venue last month.

During the 10-hour raid, the gang also smashed doors and ripped cabinets off walls.

After appearing before magistrates in Burnley, both Richards and Taylor admitted burglary.

Ms Murphy, an accountant, said: 'I feel ashamed that I trusted them. It's shaken my belief in people and I hope I'll be a better judge of character in future.'

She only charged the couple £1,060 for the whole day - including venue, champagne, chocolate fountain and bouncy castle - paying the rest of the £2,400 total herself.

'I've done the same for a few people and tried to bring some community spirit back to the area, which is quite impoverished,' added Ms Murphy, who is seven months' pregnant.

'But I would do the same again - I'm just that kind of person.

'I'm upset they've taken help away from people who really need it.

'I told the police I didn't want to see any of their group here again and I've not spoken to any of them since.'

No cash: Ms Sparks had approached the venue owner in tears, saying she did not have enough money to get married

The businesswoman, from Rossendale, Lancashire, was approached by the bride-to-be in October 2011.

'She
explained her circumstances, and she got a bit upset,' said Ms Murphy. 
'I starting meeting with her every week after that to give her the 
wedding she wanted, and we became friends.

'She'd had a bit of bad luck, her mother had died when she was younger, but she wanted the wedding of every girl's dreams.

'We had a chocolate fountain, chairs with bows and coverings, sashes in a light blue, a children's craft corner, children's and adult's buffet and a bouncy castle.

'The wedding was in July and we were burgled on January 6. It didn't even cross my mind that it would be somebody local. I've invested a lot in this area.

'The police didn't tell me the news at first because I'm seven months pregnant. When I heard who had done it in the station, I burst into tears.'

Ms Murphy bought the venue in Bacup for £175,000 from the council, who had 'mothballed' it.

Richards and Taylor will be sentenced at Burnley Crown Court next month.
