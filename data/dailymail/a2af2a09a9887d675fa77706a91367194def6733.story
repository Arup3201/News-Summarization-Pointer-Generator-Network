Luis Suarez's stunning double has left Manchester City clinging to their Champions League dream after Barcelona beat them 2-1 at the Etihad.

Suarez scored twice in the first half for Barca on his return to English football before Sergio Aguero brought City back into the tie with a goal in the 69th minute.

Lionel Messi, the game’s outstanding player, missed a 90th minute penalty when Joe Hart saved and the Barcelona forward sent the rebounded wide.

Manchester City chief Manuel Pellegrini said: ‘It was a very important save and it was a very unnecessary penalty.

‘It gives us more chance to win in Barcelona because 3-1 would have been a very difficult score to try to erase.

‘It is important for this team to continue in the Champions League as far as possible. ‘It is possible for us to demonstrate we can compete at this level. This tie isn’t over until the game ends in Barcelona. We can analyse it then. We haven’t invested more in the team than them: Suarez, Neymar, Messi was a big investment by Barcelona.’

City will be without Gael Clichy, tormented throughout by Messi, for the second leg in the Nou Camp after he was sent off for two reckless bookings.

They will need to score twice to stand any chance of progressing to the quarter-final and one bookmaker had odds of 1/25 against City getting through to the next round.

Pellegrini added: ‘Barcelona managed to get through the game without committing errors. We committed mistakes. Until the goal the game was quite even.

‘With the way we play, I think we can do it. In the second half we demonstrate we are a good. ‘It is important not to make the same mistakes. We cannot have a player sent off every game against Barcelona.

‘We played two different games: the first half and the second. Until the first goal was a very normal game and after that we concede an easy goal and played very bad until the first half finished. ‘In the second half I think we played well, we scored one goal and had two or three more chances to draw. ‘After that we repeat the same mistake as last year, which was to have one player sent off. ‘It is very difficult to play against Barcelona with 10. We finished with the penalty and Joe saved very well.

‘In the first half we couldn’t put three passes together and there was a bit of confusion. ‘We committed a very soft error for the first goal. We managed to be calmer in the second we pressed well and did well to hang on and almost get something from the game.’
