The father of a two-year-old boy crushed to death when a 30-metre gum tree fell on his home says he felt helpless as he tried for hours to get to the bedroom where his son was trapped.

Toddler Eli Marnock was killed during wild storms in Melbourne on Saturday night in a tragic accident that saw his five-year-old sister pinned under a wall and his grandfather trapped for hours as his parents tried desperately to get them out safely.

Eli's father, Stefan Marnock, 41, described his anguish as he tried in vain to get to the boy after the tree destroyed the home at The Patch, in the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, just after 9pm.

Toddler Eli Marnock, two, was killed when a 30-metre gum tree fell on his home during wild storms on Saturday

Eli's father Stefan Marnock says he felt helpless as he tried for hours to get to the room where Eli was trapped

Eli'  five-year-old sister Nicola pinned under a wall for more than an hour after the tree fell on the living room

'I was trying to get to him - that was my only concern,' Mr Marnock told Daily Mail Australia.

'He had two storeys worth of debris and a tree on top of him.

'There was no hope, I just couldn't get to him. It was a complete feeling of absolutely helplessness.'

The extent of the damage meant Mr Marnock and rescue workers couldn't access Eli's bedroom until after midnight.

'I stayed there until I got him out,' he said.

'I had the firies (fire service officers) with me, we ended up going through the wall in our bedroom cupboard.'

And the tragedy could have been even worse.

Mr Marnock said it was a nap in the car that saved the life of Eli's five-year-old sister Nicola – who wasn't tired and was on the couch watching TV instead of sleeping in the bedroom she shared with her little brother.

Mr Marnock said he was devastated by the loss of his 'cheeky' little boy who was his 'little dude'

Earlier that day the family visited Mr Marnock's father's grave as it was the fifth anniversary of his death.

When the family was back at home that evening, Nicola was on the couch watching TV and Mr Marnock and Eli's mother Suzie Surridge, 37, had walked to the front of the house to investigate the storm.

'We had actually stood up to go and look out the front door because we heard the gust of wind,' Ms Surridge said.

'We opened the front door but had to close it immediately because of the wind.

'Nicola had stayed sitting in the armchair then all of a sudden the tree from above us just came down on top.'

Ms Surridge said she and Mr Marnock were in an archway which protected them from the debris, but Nicola was trapped under a collapsed wall.

Emergency Services Minister Jane Garrett said it was the council's responsibility to make sure trees located near houses were safe, amid reports neighbours had complained about the size of the tree

'We were able to get across over the debris to where Nicola was pinned, fortunately the angle of how things had gone down it didn't crush her upper chest or head,' she said.

'I was able to sit and speak with her and keep her talking the whole time.'

Mr Marnock said Nicola was a 'little trooper' throughout the terrifying ordeal.

'She was just amazing,' he said.

'She got stressed out at times and she was a little bit concerned as to where Eli was - she knew she couldn't see their bedroom door.'

It took an hour for rescue workers to free Nicola. She was taken to hospital where she was treated for injuries including bruising and a torn liver, but she did not suffer any broken bones or haemorrhaging.

Mr Marnock's 13-year-old son Jesse, who was in a hallway when the tree came down and was not injured, ran up the street to get help from neighbours before the emergency services arrived.

Ms Surridge said Eli's death was going to hit his brothers and sisters hard, and she was struggling to come to terms with the tragedy

Ms Surridge's parents John and Sue Surridge were at the rear of the property, where they lived in the back part of the dual dwelling. Mr Surridge was trapped in a room for two hours before rescue workers got him out

'He was absolutely amazing - he was able to go up into the back section of house where Grandma Sue was and was able to vocally communicate with Grandad John because we had no visual,' Mr Marnock said.

'He helped me so much, he was my legs.

'He was my star, he was just brilliant. For a 13-year-old kid to do that is just amazing.'

Ms Surridge's parents John and Sue Surridge were at the rear of the property, where they lived in the back part of the dual dwelling.

Mr Surridge was trapped in a room for two hours before emergency services managed to get him out.

Ms Surridge's 18-year-old daughter Jackie had been out at dinner with friends before she returned home to the devastation. Mr Marnock's 11-year-old son Blake was staying at his mother's house.

Emergency Services Minister Jane Garrett said it was the council's responsibility to make sure trees located near houses were safe, amid reports neighbours had complained about the size of the tree, The Age reported.

'I just miss him,' Ms Surridge said. 'He was such a huge chunk of our world.'

'In light of the tragic circumstances of last night, we will be reviewing all of these processes and making sure that everything's being done to prevent a tragedy like this happening again.' 

Mr Marnock said he was devastated by the loss of his 'cheeky' little boy.

'He was my little dude, he was the definition of a little boy,' he said.

'He was a little monster with devilish charm.

'He was the cutest little kid with a cheeky smile.

'He'd just look at you and he knew he was doing something wrong but he'd look at you and just do it anyway.'

Ms Surridge said Eli's death was going to hit his brothers and sisters hard, and she was struggling to come to terms with the tragedy.

'I just miss him,' she said.

'He was such a huge chunk of our world.'
