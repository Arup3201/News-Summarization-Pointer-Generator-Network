Some privates in the Army fighting in Afghanistan are earning less than the National Minimum Wage (NMW), a new report claims.

The Armed Forces Pay Review Body found the long hours worked by troops, whose pay starts at £17,767 a year, means they may earn less than the £6.31 an hour NMW for those over 21 and £5.03 an hour for those over 18.

The report says: ‘It is possible for those on the lowest pay level to be earning below NMW levels if they work over 55 hours per week, for those aged 21 or over, or more than 68 hours per week if they are aged between 18 and 20.

'As the average number of hours worked is much higher for those personnel on overseas operations or at sea, the more time someone spends in these locations the greater the chance of breaching NMW thresholds.’

The body has recommended a series of measures to improve pay in the military, including a one per cent increase in base pay and an increase in certain allowances, such as the Unpleasant Living Allowance, which compensates service men and women when living conditions fall below a minimum standard.

But an MoD spokesman said: ‘We have worked hard to ensure that the sacrifices and dedication of our personnel is recognised, which is why they have continued to receive pay rises and also qualify for other benefits including subsidised accommodation, generous non-contributory pensions and substantial periods of paid leave.

'It is therefore entirely misleading to suggest that personnel earn less than the minimum wage.'

The MoD says the findings of the Armed Forces' Pay Review Body are 'misleading'. File picture

In 1998 the armed forces were excluded from the minimum wage, when ministers claimed it was hard to calculate hourly earnings as servicemen are always available for duty.

Meanwhile, shortages in the 
Armed Forces have triggered a rise in ‘Golden Hello’ one-off payments 
for personnel to stay in service.

On
 top of their salaries, military nurses are being offered £20,000 and 
weapons engineers aboard submarines £50,000 to sign-on for an extra five
 years.

On the Golden Hello payments, the spokesman added: 
‘As is common practice among commercial organisations, we use financial 
retention incentives to ensure we retain essential skills and experience
 within the Armed Forces.’

The news comes as Nato's secretary general called for increased defence spending in a bid to curb Russian military aggression.

Anders Fogh Rasmussen said member states must modernise their armed forces to check Moscow's intervention in the Crimea.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'Every ally needs to invest the necessary resources in the right capabilities.

'That means modern equipment, intensive training for our forces, and closer cooperation among Nato allies and with our partners.'
