A British-born photographer kidnapped by Al Qaeda could have been saved if US special forces hadn’t attempted a rescue operation, his family said yesterday.

US Navy SEALS - with the help of British special forces - mounted a dramatic rescue bid to save Luke Somers but he was shot dead by his captors as they moved in to the compound in Yemen.

His heartbroken family were kept in the dark about the operation and were against a rescue mission because they believed he would have been freed through negotiations.

British-born photographer Luke Somers, kidnapped by Al Qaeda, could have been saved if US special forces hadn’t attempted a rescue operation, his family said yesterday

A South African teacher being held prisoner alongside Mr Somers was due to be released by the terrorists yesterday but he too was killed in the raid as it emerged forces in the botched rescue attempt were not aware he was there.

Speaking from her home in Deal, Kent, Mr Somers’s stepmother Penny Bearman, 55, told the Mail: ‘At no point were we told of the plans.

‘The FBI have been keeping Luke’s dad informed of developments, but only after they have happened.’

She said, had they been told, ‘certain family members would have been very much against it’.

‘There was every chance his release would have been secured by a negotiation as the South African’s captive had been.

‘As a family we believe, like we think Luke would have, negotiation would have been the way forward.’

US Navy Seals crept within 100 yards of the compound in a remote mountain hideout in Yemen where the hostages were being held on Saturday.

The raid was thwarted when the advancing forces were spotted by a lone insurgent.

The mission was ordered by Barack Obama after terrorists on Thursday had threatened to kill photographer Mr Somers, 33, if the US did not meet the group’s unspecified demands or if another rescue was attempted.

Mr Somers, who spent most of his childhood in London but later became a US citizen, was killed shortly after the dawn raid began in Shabwa province, a stronghold of the terrorist network Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

It is understood a British force of 10 SAS and intelligence operatives based in the region provided key information to their US counterparts.

Pierre Korkie was shot dead by the terrorist group alongside Mr Somers after mediators had been working on an ‘arrangement to take him out’.

A charity working with Mr Korkie said they had expected his release on Sunday, and that the US rescue attempt had ‘destroyed everything’.

Gift of the Givers’ Yemen project director Anas Hamati said: ‘His passport was ready, everything was ready.

‘In that time the attack happened by US special forces in Yemen and that has destroyed everything.’

A senior official in the US administration said that the rescuers were not aware that Mr Korkie was being held with Mr Somers.

It is understood that a payment had been made to enable the release of Mr Korkie.

Mr Korkie was abducted with his wife Yolande in May last year in Taiz, Yemen. She was freed on 10 January without ransom and returned to South Africa.

The charity said in a statement: ‘The psychological and emotional devastation to Yolande and her family will be compounded by the knowledge that Pierre was to be released by al-Qaeda tomorrow.’

Mr Somers was kidnapped in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 2013 by an Al Qaeda affiliate 

Mr Somers moved from London to Sana'a, Yemen in 2011 to become a teacher, but soon started taking pictures of public demonstrations and established himself as a photojournalist working for the Yemen Times

Mr Somers had moved to Yemen in 2011 to teach English but soon began photographing protests in the capital.

He was taken hostage in 2013 and sold to AQAP by local criminals.

Mrs Bearman told the Mail how Mr Somers’ family members were kept in the dark about what was happening.

She said: ‘It has all been very hush hush. The individual family members are not supposed to get involved with political decision making.

‘It has been very frustrating but not at all surprising.’

She added: ‘The more publicity these cases get the more they seem to end badly.’

Asked if the family were supportive of the rescue operation, she responded: ‘No. We think Luke would have believed that talking to them would have led to his release.’

His sister Lucy, 25, said: ‘Luke was a loving, creative and curious person.

A charity working with Mr Korkie said they had expected his release on Sunday, and that the US rescue attempt had ‘destroyed everything’ 

‘He found a way of life and people that he loved in Yemen, and worked tirelessly to raise awareness where he saw suffering around him, to join people together, and help change situations for the better.

‘The tragedy of his death, and injustice of how he was used, must be undone by the warmth, strength, and humanity in his images.’

The dramatic raid was launched under the cover of darkness following a desperate search for the terrorists’ hideout.

A team of up to 20 Navy SEALS then watched the Al Qaeda compound in the village of Wadi Abadan for 24 hours, fine-tuning their preparations.

On Friday evening, up to a further 80 Navy SEALS and Yemeni troops were flown from a US ship in the Arabian Gulf and touched down at a secret landing zone near the village.

According to US and Yemeni reports, a dramatic firefight took place after an insurgent spotted their advance and raised the alarm just as the Navy SEALS were poised to snatch the hostages.

The heavily armed SEALS sprinted from house to house, surrounding the compound and shooting up to ten suspected terrorists.

US commanders appealed for the terrorists to surrender but they shot the two hostages which prompted the forces to open fire.

US forces pulled Mr Somers and Mr Korkie on to V-22 Osprey aircraft and medical teams began performing surgery in mid-air.

One hostage died during the short flight and the second died after the Ospreys landed on the USS Makin Island, a navy ship in the region.
