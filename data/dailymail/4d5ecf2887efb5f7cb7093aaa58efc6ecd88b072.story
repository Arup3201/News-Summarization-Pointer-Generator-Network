Patients in England will have to pay 20p more for their prescriptions starting next month, ministers have announced.

From 1 April, charges will go up from £7.85 to £8.05, and they will rise again to £8.20 the following year.

England remains the only country in the UK where patients still pay for prescriptions, which are free in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Patients in England will have to pay 20p more for their prescriptions starting next month, ministers have announced

The Government said the increase was necessary to meet the growing demands on the NHS - its spending on drugs has more than doubled since 2000

But charities say the charges unfairly tax sick patients - particularly those with long-term conditions such as asthma, multiple sclerosis, diabetes and migraines who are on several drugs.

And senior pharmacists say some patients are having to choose between paying for drugs to alleviate pain or buying food and keeping their homes warm.

They are also routinely being asked by frail patients whether there are any drugs they could possibly to without as they are unable to afford all those their GP has prescribed.

Announcing the increase yesterday, health minister Earl Howe said: ‘This government has made tough decisions to protect the NHS budget and increase it in real terms, but charges for some items remain an important source of revenue to support the delivery of high quality NHS services.

‘This is particularly important given the increasing demands on the NHS, with spending on medicines alone almost doubling since 2000.’

But Neal Patel, spokesperson from Royal Pharmaceutical Society said: ‘Prescription charges have risen for 34 of the past 35 years.

‘Many have to choose between paying for their medicine or household bills such as food and heating. They face medicines poverty because they have a lifelong illness they don’t want.’

England remains the only country in the UK where patients still pay for prescriptions

Last week research carried out by the Prescription Charges Coalition - which represents 30 health charities - found that a third of patients had stopped taking drugs because they were too expensive.

The organisation - which surveyed 5,000 patients with long term conditions - also found that three quarters had to take time off work.

David Barker,chief executive of Crohn’s and Colitis UK, one of the charities represented by the organisation said: ‘These findings tell a heartbreaking story of people facing medicine-poverty because of the spiralling cost of their essential drugs.

‘Many are risking their health, and their ability to work, by having to make the impossible decision between taking their much-needed medicines to enable them to remain in employment, or putting food on the table for their families.

England is now the only country in the UK still making patients pay for prescriptions as there were abolished in Scotland in 2011 in Wales in 2007 and in Northern Ireland 2010.

It means that English patients are effectively subsiding free drugs for those living elsewhere in the UK.

But recent concerns over poor hospital care in Wales - in particular long waiting times - have been linked to the abolition of prescription charges.

A number of hospitals have high death rates and patients are waiting far longer for tests to diagnose cancer as well as in A&E.

Experts have said prescription charges are necessary to fund a high standard of NHS care.
