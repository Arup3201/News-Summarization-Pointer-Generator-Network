Robert Lewandowski has made a good impression in his first week at Bayern Munich, scoring an outrageously good goal with his heel.

With many of their stars still away on World Cup duty, Lewandowski is adapting to life at Bayern after being unveiled officially on Wednesday, but this strike will remind Bayern fans why they signed him.

After playing a one-two, Lewandowski received the ball with his back to 
goal, flicked it up in the air, and then back-heeled it past the 
onrushing goalkeeper.
