Google today added stunning footage of the Arctic Tundra and its Polar Bear inhabitants to Street view - and also revealed staff had had a close encounter when capturing the images.

Aware of the animal's ferocity, Google wisely decided to mount its cameras on top of a 'Street View ice buggy' rather than its traditional backpack - but this didn't stop one animal taking a closer look.

The images, to celebrate International Polar Bear Day, were captured in Churchill.

The Street View Trekker camera took more than a year to develop.

It weighs 40lb and includes a multi-lens 15-megapixel camera, an on-board hard drive, and enough battery to run for an entire day.

Cameras are positioned to give a 360-degree view so every possible angle is captured and photos are automatically captured every 2.5 seconds.

The Trekker can be fitted inside a backpack meaning it can be worn by Google photographer - or mounted on vehicles to avoid bear attacks.

Google worked with Krista Wright, Executive Director of Polar Bears International to capture the images, converting one of the organisation's research vehicles into a roving 360 degree camera.

She revealed a buggy was the only option to capture the animals.

'In Inuit poetry, the polar bear is known as Pihoqahiak, the ever-wandering one,' she said.

'Some of the most majestic and elusive creatures in the world, polar bears travel hundreds of miles every year, wandering the tundra and Arctic sea ice in search of food and mates.

'Today, with the help of Street View, we’re celebrating International Polar Bear Day by sharing an intimate look at polar bears in their natural habitat.'

The Street View Trekker, usually carried on a backpack was mounted on a Tundra Buggy, with the help of outfitters Frontiers North.

'This allowed us to travel across this fragile landscape without interfering with the polar bears or other native species,' said Wright.

'Through October and November we collected Street View imagery from the shores of Hudson’s Bay as the polar bears waited for the sea ice to freeze over.'

'We’ve joined forces with Google Maps to collect Street View imagery from a remote corner of Canada’s tundra: Churchill, Manitoba, home to one of the largest polar bear populations on the planet.'

PBI has been working in this region for more than 20 years, and claims to have witnessed firsthand the profound impact of warmer temperatures and melting sea ice on the polar bear’s environment. 

It hopes that regular visits from the Google team will help it spot changes.

'Understanding global warming, and its impact on polar bear populations, requires both global and regional benchmarks.

'Bringing Street View to Canada's tundra establishes a baseline record of imagery associated with specific geospatial data—information that’s critical if we’re to understand and communicate the impact of climate change on their sensitive ecosystem.

'As we work to safeguard their habitat, PBI can add Street View imagery to the essential tools we use to assess and respond to the biggest threat facing polar bears today.'

The organisation has also been working with Google to create a live 'bear tracker'

'We also use the Google Maps API to support our Bear Tracker, which illustrates the frozen odyssey these bears embark on every year.

'As winter approaches and the sea ice freezes over, polar bears head out onto Hudson Bay to hunt for seals.

'Bear Tracker uses of satellite monitors and an interactive Google Map to display their migration for a global audience.'

The project, which can be seen below, lets people track the animals in real time as they move.

The project is the latest from Google in the area, which has already visited the Arctic communities of Cambridge Bay and Iqaluit.

In the town of Churchill, the Google Maps team conducted a community MapUp, which let participants use Map Maker to edit and add to the Google Map.
