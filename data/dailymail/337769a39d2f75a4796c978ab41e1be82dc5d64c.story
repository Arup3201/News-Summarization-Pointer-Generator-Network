A wardrobe full of the finest haute couture pieces combined with urban street style and some serious posing on Instagram.

No, we're not talking about Rihanna. Say hello instead to Montjiro, a Japanese chihuaha widely believed to be the best dressed dog on internet.

With a wardrobe so well stocked it would be the envy of most two-legged fashion fans, let alone his canine contemporaries, designer dog Montjiro has become a star on Instagram with 4,700 fans now following on his page.

Fashion, darling: Meet Montjiro, the most fashionable pup on Instagram who owns more than 200 outfits

Montjiro is in the unlikely position 
of having his own clothing line, handcrafted by his owner and modelled 
by Montjiro himself (of course).

The stylish animal works the camera 
in a variety of on-trend outfits that his owner designs and dresses him 
in, helping to market the range to fellow dog owners so they can clothe 
their own pampered pups.

Called Monâ€™t, the brand offers hats, ties, vests, jackets, and kimonos.

Here is a selection of the best bits - showcased by the one and only Montjiro.
