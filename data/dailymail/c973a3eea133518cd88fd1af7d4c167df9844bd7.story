Media mogul Rupert Murdoch grinned broadly as he reached an 'amicable' divorce deal with his wife of 14 years Wendi Deng after only six minutes of negotiations, in which she they decided she will reportedly receive their New York home and he will get their California mansion.

Mr Murdoch, 82, and a stoney-faced Wendi Deng Murdoch, 44, shook hands and briefly hugged after a brief proceeding in a New York  court.

The couple said they were parting with 'mutual respect' after telling a judge they had reached a divorce deal.

'Amicable': Smiling media mogul Rupert Murdoch and wife of 14 years Wendi Deng, who was positively stoney-faced, are pictured outside court in New York today where they said they were parting with 'mutual respect'

According to a report in the LA Times, Mr Murdoch will keep his Beverly Hills estate and his $28 million 16-acre Moraga Vineyards in the hills above Bel-Air.

Meanwhile Wendi Deng will keep the three-floor penthouse apartment on Manhattan's fifth avenue which Mr Murdoch reportedly paid $44million for in 2004.

The stunning property occupies the 14th 15th and 16th floors and is roughly 8,000 square feet with 20 rooms.

The Murdochs reportedly spent a further $50million refurbishing the home which was once owned by Laurance Rockefeller.

Mr Murdoch has two young daughters with Wendi Deng and is understood to want them to remain living with their mother in New York.

The terms of 
the agreement weren't disclosed in court.

'We
 are pleased to announce that we have reached an amicable settlement of 
all matters relating to our divorce,' the two said in a statement 
released through a publicist.

'We move forward with mutual respect and a shared interest in the health and happiness of our two daughters.'

The
 divorce isn't technically final; it will happen after state Supreme 
Court Justice Ellen Gesmer signs some yet-to-be-submitted paperwork. She
 told the couple Wednesday she was 'glad that you have been able to 
resolve these matters amicably.'

The
 two answered Gesmer's yes-and-no questions about whether they 
understood and approved an agreement ending their marriage. Asked 
whether he was satisfied with the agreement, Rupert Murdoch replied in a
 strong voice, 'Yes, your honor.'

The
 settlement is largely based on two prenuptial agreements and two 
'postnuptial' agreements that modified the original agreements, a person
 familiar with the situation said Tuesday, speaking on condition of 
anonymity because the matter is personal.

Wendi Deng will reportedly receive the couple's apartment in New York 
which Mr Murdoch is understood to have paid $44million for back in 2004

Mr Murdoch reportedly put his yacht up for sale in September with an asking price of $29.7million

The yacht's interiors were designed by Christian Liaigre and features pale oak woods, Hermes leather furnishings and neutral palettes throughout

The
 divorce will end a third marriage for Rupert Murdoch who got his 
start in his family's newspaper business in his native Australia and 
built a global media conglomerate. Forbes pegged his and his family's 
wealth at $13.4 billion in September.

Murdoch's
 News Corp. split this year into two companies: the journalism and 
publishing portion, still called News Corp., and the more profitable 
film and TV unit, 21st Century Fox. Both are publicly traded and based 
in New York.

The 
divorce won't affect control of the companies or the succession plan for
 them. Rupert Murdoch controls them through a family trust that benefits
 his four children from previous marriages - Prudence, Elisabeth, 
Lachlan and James. The latter three have had active roles in the 
companies.

Upon Rupert 
Murdoch's death, all four will have an equal say in what happens to the 
roughly 38 per cent voting stock the trust holds in both companies.
