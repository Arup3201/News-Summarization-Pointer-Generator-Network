Four inmates were killed by gunfire  and another 11 wounded, mostly with knives, at a prison in central Bolivia after a party exploded into gang violence.

Among the injured were two women, one of them pregnant, police said. The foetus didn't survive because a bullet perforated her womb, said Dr Eduardo Amaya.

Families often live together in Latin American prisons. 

The fight broke out after drunken partying that began on Sunday in the El Abra prison, which is just outside the city of Cochabamba.

The four dead were all Bolivian and included a prison gang boss named Ariel Tancara, whose throat was reportedly slit.

Rivalry between Bolivian and foreign prison gangs was to blame, according to the regional police commander, Alberto Suarez.

'Because of these power struggles, fighting has broken out in which unfortunately people have been wounded by knives and firearms,' Suarez told Radio Fides.

He did not say where the foreign inmates were from, but Bolivian media reports said they were Colombians jailed for drug trafficking.

Witnesses said the inmates held a party Sunday night that included alcohol and live music.

Inmates' family members condemned prison officials for allowing alcohol into the prison, accusing them of corruption.

Authorities periodically confiscate weapons and drugs in Bolivia's overcrowded prisons but, just as in other nations in the region, inmates bribe prison guards to smuggle them in

Local ombudsman Edgar Julio Flores added: 'The authorities need to explain how people got guns into the prison.'

Amaya said most of the wounded had knife wounds.

In August 2013, a battle among rival gangs in the Palmasola prison in the eastern city of Santa Cruz claimed 35 lives, including an 18-month-old. Many of them were burned to death by homemade flamethrowers.

Three of the instigators were sentenced last week to 30 years in prison each.

According to official figures, 1,500 Bolivian children live with a parent behind bars 

Bolivia's prisons are the most crowded in Latin America after El Salvador's, according to the Organization of American States.

Its jails have the capacity to hold 3,738 prisoners, but currently house 13,840.
