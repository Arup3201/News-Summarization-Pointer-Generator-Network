Every driver's worst nightmare became a horrific reality for one Queensland woman who was lucky enough to escape with her life.

Judy Sokol was driving to Maryborough, just north of Brisbane, last Wednesday when she found herself in a heart-stopping, unavoidable situation, the Courier Mail reports.

A camera attached to her dashboard recorded the moment that a white semi-trailer, which was driving directly towards her, came into vision through the mist.

Ms Sokol's bewildered gasps could be heard as she noticed the truck and instantly swerved her car off the road.

Despite her quick action, the huge truck struggled to avoid her Ford Territory by attempting to switch lanes at the last moment.

The footage shows the moment the side of the truck slammed into her driver's side door.

A second bang, which can be heard after the initial blow, came from the car travelling behind her which then rear-ended her vehicle.

Despite quickly swerving off the road, the truck had lost control in the wet conditions and struggled to avoid her vehicle

'My beautiful Territory is a write off, but kept me safe,' Ms Sokol wrote in the video's caption after sharing it on Facebook.

'[I] have a fat lip and a few bruises, but happy to be alive.'

The video has been viewed over 4000 times since it was posted five days ago.

It has also received hundreds of comments from people who are bewildered that Ms Sokol managed to both survive and refrain from swearing during the ordeal. 

It slammed into her driver's side door, destroying her car, but Ms Sokol said she was just happy to be alive
