A Fox News presenter yesterday launched a live tirade against a secular seasonal display set to be erected next to a Christmas display at a state Capitol building.

Florida governor Rick Scott's office last week gave the green light to proposals to install a Festivus pole made of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer cans next to a nativity display.

Festivus is a well-celebrated parody alternative to Christmas popularised by the Nineties sitcom Seinfeld and invented by the family of one of its scriptwriters.

'Outraged': Fox News host Gretchen Carlson launched an outspoken tirade against the plans for a Festivus pole outside Florida's capital building during a broadcast alongside religious experts on the network yesterday

The holiday, which has evolved into a form of playful resistance to the commercialisation of Christmas, involves an unadorned aluminium 'Festivus pole' in place of a tree, as well as farcical traditions such as the 'Airing of Grievances' and the 'Feats of Strength'.

However, the joke was lost on Fox host Gretchen Carlson, who pronounced herself 'outraged' during a broadcast alongside Catholic League president Bill Donohue yesterday.

'Why do I have to drive around with my kids to look for a nativity scenes and be, like, "Oh, yeah, kids, look, there’s baby Jesus behind the Festivus pole made out of beer cans!" It’s nuts!

Mr Donohue chimed in: 'We don’t have 
to have the Klan out there on Martin Luther King Day with their 
monuments right next to a bust of Martin Luther King.

'We don’t want to have neo-Nazis out there to stick it to Jews on Yom Kippur. And we shouldn’t have people out there ready to trash Christianity given that proximity.

'Let them do it some other time and some other place.'

But David Silverman, president of American Atheists, who was also part of the panel discussion, defended the idea of a public display of secularism so close to Christmas.

'The season doesn't belong to Christianity, the season belongs to everyone,' he said. 'Christianity stole the season from the Solstice.'

He added: 'There is no wrong way to celebrate the season, it belongs to all of us. I say it’s much better without religion. Dump the church, you don’t like it anyway. Happy Festivus! For all of us!'

The row over Festivus marks a coming of age for the parody winter festival, which first entered popular culture after it was made the focus of a 1997 episode of Seinfeld.

It had its genesis in the family of Dan O'Keefe, a writer for the long-running sitcom, whose father Daniel Lawrence O'Keefe, a Reader's Digest editor, invented it in 1966 to commemorate he and his wife's first date.

That was a date in February, however in the original O'Keefe family tradition, the holiday would take place in response to family tension, 'any time from December to May.'

After a rapid rise in popularity, these days Festivus is celebrated on December 23 as a parody alternative to Christmas.

In 2005, Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle was declared 'Governor Festivus' and during the holiday season displayed a Festivus Pole in the family room of the Executive Residence in Madison, Wisconsin.
