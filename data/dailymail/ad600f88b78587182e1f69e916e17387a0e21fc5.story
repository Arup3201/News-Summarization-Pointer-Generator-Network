Sir Ian McKellen paid a visit to Oxford University recently to speak to students about the importance of revision for their exams.

The subject matter led him to slip into the character of Gandalf from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and recite one of the films' most famous lines.

'If you don't work hard, if you don't do your revision, you know what will happen,' McKellen tells the seated students at the elite university.

The cheering fans were certainly pleased with whistling and an extended round of applause for the legendary 75-year-old actor.

One PPE student said 'He made me feel like the happiest person ever – it was worth the two hour wait!'

'I'm glad he had to courtesy to come out and talk to us, given that the Union made us stand outside for two hours and didn't tell us we weren't getting in,' added another Geography student.

The 'You shall not pass,' line appeared in the first Middle Earth-based film The Fellowship of the Ring.

McKellen's appearance at the Union  led to queues of over two hours. The event was massively oversubscribed, with many left unable to get in due to the hordes of students there to see Gandalf in the flesh.
