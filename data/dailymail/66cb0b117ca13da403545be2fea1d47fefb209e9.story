Clutched in her mothers arms, she looks like a healthy three month old baby.

But Maria Lorena was in fact born just a few days ago - weighing a staggering 13lbs 3oz.

Her mother, expat Briton Maxine Marin, became the first woman in Spain to give birth naturally to a baby heavier than four kilos (8lb 8oz) in the early hours of Tuesday morning - without even an epidural painkiller.

Pictured holding her new heavyweight arrival for the time, Maxine, 40, revealed how even the pregnancy with husband Jaime came as a big surprise as she'd recently undergone an operation to remove an ovary.

The mother-of-four, who has three sons from a previous relationship, said: 'I went in for an op to remove a cyst on one of my ovaries a year ago and they ended up removing the ovary itself.

'A lot of people panic and think they've no chance of getting pregnant with just the one ovary.

'But it wasn't a real worry for me and Jaime since we weren't planning on having children because of our ages.

'It was a complete shock to say the least when I found out I was pregnant.

'My youngest child was 12 at the time so it's been a while since I've changed a nappy.

'But I'm over at the moon to have a daughter after three sons and Jaime's pleased because he's a first-time dad.

'To be told I'm the first woman in Spain to give birth to a baby over four kilos without a caesarian is an amazing feeling.

'I knew she was going to be big but not this big. She looks just a teddy bear. She's a beautiful miracle.'

She christened the child Maria Lorena after her mother-in-law and a colleague at the travel agency where she works.

Big baby: The child is almost twice the size of the average newborn baby girl

Heavyweight: Maxine Marin, pictured with her husband Jaime and baby girl Maria, revealed how she was stunned when she became pregnant as she'd recently had an ovary removed.

Maxine, originally from Burntwood, Staffordshire, went into labour just after midnight on Tuesday and Maria Lorena arrived at 4.43am that morning.

Doctors at the hospital in the Costa Blanca resort of Denia where she gave birth didn't even need to give her an epidural.

Maxine, who married construction worker Jaime in September last year, said: 'I was asking for an epidural but the midwife kept telling me I didn't need one and I was only worried because the baby was big and not because I was in any pain.

'She told me to calm down and relax and as soon as I did, she just popped out.

'Everyone gasped when they saw the saw the size of her and then weighed her.

'Even the doctors thought she was only going to weigh around 11lbs right up to the day she arrived.

'Everyone who sees her is amazed by just how big she is.

'I'm only normally around eight and a half stone and my husband weighs around 11 stone.

'In
 the first months of my pregnancy before it became apparent Maria was 
big, I thought it might be something to do with me eating too much. But I
 think the big baby thing must come from my side of the family.

'My mum Vivien weighed 12lbs when she was born and my uncle George was even bigger.

'All three of my boys have been born big, from nearly 8lbs to more than 10lbs, although they're all normal-size now.

'I don't know why. I've got absolutely no clue. All I know is that the clothes and the nappies I've bought are going to be too small because I've given birth to a baby who needs a clothes size three to six months straight away.'

Maxine, who is also mother to Steffan, 22, Dale, 16, and Callum, 13, is expected to leave hospital later today.

Her new daughter is due to remain in a neo-natal observation unit but only as a precaution because large babies sometimes experience breathing problems.

She said: 'I called her Maria Lorena because Jaime's mum is Maria and I've got a south African work colleague called Lauren - Lorena in Spanish - who's stunningly beautiful.

'I told her I wanted to name my daughter after her because that's the way I'd like her to be when she grows up, with her looks and her character.

'I think the hospital staff are just proud to be able to say the only baby to be born naturally in Spain over four kilos has been born in their hospital.'

Javier Rius, Head of Gynaecology at Denia's Marina Salud Hospital, added: 'In 40 years professional practice I've never known a case of a baby with this weight being born naturally.

'We are very happy with the work we've done,' he added.
