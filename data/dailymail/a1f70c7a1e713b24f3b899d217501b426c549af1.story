A homeless man drowned one of the contestants at a Saturday morning fishing match in a totally random attack, a court heard.

Anthony Ogburn, who had been having a 'psychotic episode' at the time, claimed he was doing God’s will, Chester Crown Court was told.

In the run-up to the killing he had been making bizarre allegations about his family and he had books about murder and the Lancashire Witches in his possession, prosecutor Andrew Thomas QC said.

Ogburn, 41, drowned angler Harry Morris, 57, a much-loved family man and father-of-six in the canal at Sankey Valley Park, Warrington in June this year.

He denied murder but admitted 
manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

His plea was accepted by the prosecution
and Judge Elgan Edwards, QC, the Recorder of Chester, ordered him to be
detained at Ashworth secure hospital.

Mr Thomas said: 'When challenged by one of the others present during the attack he said: ''He has killed my dad and done my family''.

Both claims were untrue.

Mr Thomas added: 'He was a complete stranger to Mr Morris and it was a completely random attack'.

In the weeks before the drowning Ogburn, originally of Widnes, who had no history of mental problems, had been making bizarre allegations which prompted his daughter to call the police, said Mr Thomas.

He told the centre manager at Warrington YMCA, where he was living, that he was 'fleeing violence towards myself.'

After he had made false complaints that his sister had been murdered, police searched his room and found books on murder and the Lancashire Witches.

Ogburn told the YMCA manager (prior to the drowning) that he had been out fishing and some males had stolen his drink, kidnapped him and held him in a van.

Police became concerned about his mental state and referred him to a local mental health crisis team.

Assessments were done at two venues. It was established that Ogburn had a history of drug and alcohol addiction since the age of 16.

Judge Elgan Edwards, QC, the Recorder of Chester, ordered Ogburn to be detained at Ashworth secure hospital in Merseyside

Mr Thomas said: 'The assessment at the time was that there was no obvious mental disturbance and his methadone dosage was reduced'.

Ogburn had been receiving treatment for drug addiction since 1995. Since 2009 he has been clean of Class A drugs but he was still taking methadone, alcohol and cannabis.

Three psychiatrists who examined Ogburn after his arrest all agreed he had a 'psychotic disorder' at the time of the incident.

Ogburn was ordered to be detained at Ashworth secure hospital under Section 37 of the Mental Health Act.

Judge Edwards said: 'At present I consider you to be a profoundly dangerous man. You will not be released until a Mental Health Tribunal considers it safe to do so.'
