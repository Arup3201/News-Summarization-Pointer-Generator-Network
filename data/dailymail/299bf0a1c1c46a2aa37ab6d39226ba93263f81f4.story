Intricate: All the items in the room, including this pot of flowers, have been made from Belgian chocolate

Sculptor Elena Kliment used over 600kg of Belgian chocolate to create everything from the 
fireplace to the tea cups to the chest of drawers.

The masterpiece took two months to prepare and two weeks of work to transform the chocolate into furniture and home decorations.

The
room will be on display in the ALL shopping mall until April 14 after 
which some of the chocolate in the room will be cut into small pieces 
and offered to visitors.

This is not the first room to have been crafted entirely out of chocolate.

The room, featuring everything from 
bookshelves to atwork to chocolate lettuce leaves was on display in a 
local supermarket for two weeks over Valentine's day.
