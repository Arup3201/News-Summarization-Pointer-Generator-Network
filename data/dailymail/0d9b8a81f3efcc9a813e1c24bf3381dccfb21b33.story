Knit wear certainly made a big appearance at the men's fashion week in London today with male models donning huge super-sized hats, scarves and gloves.

Many of the knitted offerings during the Sibling show at London Collections were so big that the models' faces were barely visible underneath.

Some outfits paired a large knitted hat with a model's bare torso and colourful pants while others teamed the winter warmers with furry pink shorts and the trendy onesie.

And a few of the knitted jumpers had 'Please Kill Me' spelled out in flowers on the front.

The
 Sibling brand - described as being 'all for one and one for all' -  is a
 collaboration between designers Joe Bates, Sid Bryan and Cozette 
McCreery.

Sibling
 is relatively new after being launched in 2008 'out of a desire to give
 knitwear for men a good old fashioned shake-up with cartoon ka-pows of 
colour and bams of very English humour'. 

Asked to name their trade mark piece, they've said: 'If it were a popularity contest, it would be a fight between the Knit Monster and the printed Knitted Biker.'

Their show comes after a less than 
traditional start to the London show yesterday with bizarre hats made 
out of wooden planks, models with 'blacked out' faces, and some ankle 
swinging sportswear among some of the truly outlandish designs which 
kicked off Men's fashion week.

Martine
 Rose's A/W 2013 collection took inspiration from the traditional pub 
with garments made out of beer mats and bar towels.

Meanwhile YMC'S knitwear party and Margaret Howell brought back the French beret with their collections.

All were sat in the front row of the Richard James Autumn/Winter 2013 collection today - making his shows one of the most hotly-anticipated.

Model David Gandy - who is a British Fashion Council member - said he wants to make London the menswear capital of the world.

The ambassador for Men's Fashion Week said the event would be 'bigger than ever' this year.

Gandy said that he believed London was 'number one in the world' in the fashion stakes adding that fashion was a nine 'billion dollar' industry in the UK.

The lesser-known men's fashion week, sponsored by Topman, sees 60 menswear designers showcase their wares for autumn/winter 2013 over three days in the city in front of assembled press and buyers from over 45 countries.
