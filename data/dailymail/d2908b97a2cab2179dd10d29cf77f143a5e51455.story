By the time Rory McIlroy has finished you do wonder if there will be any meaningful record left in Europe that doesn’t have his name attached.

The bar appeared to have been set forbiddingly high with Sir Nick Faldo’s six majors and Colin Montgomerie’s remarkable tally of eight Orders of Merit, but the Northern Irishman is now so far ahead of the game even these storied records will surely not survive the passage of time.

Faldo and Monty were both 30 years old when they first started on their twin pillars of achievement.

Rory McIlroy has sealed another Race to Dubai victory with the season's climax still to come

The world No 1 has earned more than twice as many points as his closest competitors on the tour

At just 25, McIlroy is two-thirds of the way to Faldo’s total and on Sunday was formally declared the winner of the Race to Dubai for the second time in three years. The latter is the modern-day equivalent of the Order of Merit but might also have to be renamed if McIlroy keeps winning it before the race ever gets within view of the Emirate.

With more than twice as many points as the man in second place, McIlroy actually lapped the field despite not playing for the past six weeks and there’s no reason to think this will not happen again and again over the next decade, just as it did in America with Tiger Woods.

One smidgeon of hope for the rest might be if he concentrates on the PGA Tour but his schedule this year suggests the opposite will be the case.

Look at what happened. After a year’s absence, McIlroy played in the Dubai Desert Classic in February and admitted it had been a mistake leaving it off his list. In May, his previous ambivalence towards the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth was dismissed with a series of statements where he declared it is the event all Europeans should compete in.

The Irish Open is now run by his own charitable trust, while the Scottish Open can surely look forward to McIlroy’s support for the foreseeable future after this year’s event proved such a valuable dry run for his victory at The Open the following week.

He also turned up at the Alfred Dunhill Links in Scotland in October.

If he continues at this rate McIlroy could dominate Europe the way Tiger Woods did in America

One criticism of the Race to Dubai is that you can win it almost without setting foot in Europe, given winnings from the American majors and World Golf Championship events all count. Well, McIlroy not only won more money than anyone else on the European Tour’s international schedule, he also won more than anyone else if you just counted events in Europe.

I’m told it might be nine months before we know the name of George O’Grady’s successor as the tour’s chief executive.

Whoever it proves to be, what a stroke of fortune to have a world No 1 on board who is both fully committed to playing his part and set to dominate for years to come.

Koepka closes in on Rookie prize

It took 49 years for an American to win the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year award on the European Tour. Now, following Peter Uihlein’s success last year, it appears almost certain his great friend Brooks Koepka will become the 50th.

Brooks Koepka is almost certain to become the second American in two years to be Rookie of the Year

Koepka’s victory over Ian Poulter at the Turkish Airlines Open on Sunday was the most rewarding part yet of their wonderful three-year road trip.

Forsaking the chance to establish themselves in their homeland, the two great buddies set out in 2012 to see the world and earn their playing privileges far away from home.

They started out on the Challenge Tour and have graduated so spectacularly they’re now claiming prestigious prizes on the main circuit.

In particular, 24-year-old Koepka (left) looks ready to add his name to the crop of driven young Americans who are going to make the next Ryder Cup an awful lot closer than the last one.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK

‘The last psychiatrist I spoke to recommended taking up golf to relieve stress — and that’s a bad idea. Golf’s more stressful than combat.’

It might sound like a bad joke from a second-rate comic but the eye-catching remarks actually belong to Rob O’Neill, the Navy SEAL who shot dead Osama bin Laden. He was speaking to the New York Post.

On Turnberry’s own website, the par-four ninth on the Ailsa course is described as a spectacular par four but it’s clearly not enough for Donald Trump, who recently bought the Open venue on the Ayrshire coast. 

Donald Trump wants to make the picturesque course even more spectacular by tranforming the ninth hole

The tycoon has declared his intention to turn it into a breathtaking par three. To be fair, from the back tee over the rocks to a green perched just the other side, with the fabled lighthouse adjacent, you can see what he is envisaging. His hopes are naturally understated.

‘It will be the most spectacular short hole in the world,’ he said.
