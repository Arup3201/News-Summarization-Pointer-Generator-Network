Despite European Championship elimination, a new list of cities with the most beautiful women in the world reveals men in Russia and Ukraine still have plenty to cheer about.

After Wayne Rooney's winner for England last night, people in the Ukrainian capital Kiev will be happily looking to each other for consolation.

Travelers Digest's Top Ten Cities With The Most Beautiful Woman says Kiev is 'without a doubt, home to the world’s most beautiful women'.

Stunner: Ukrainian born actress Mila Kunis who starred in Hollywood film Forgetting Sarah Marshall comes from the country whose capital city Kiev was named as having the world's best looking women

Eastern beauty: Karina Zhyronkina, the 21-year-old Ukrainian student, (left) who 
was crowned Miss Ukraine 2012 in Kiev this year comes from a city with 
the worlds most beautiful women as does Stogniy Olena (right) a student from Kiev, crowned Miss Ukraine in Kiev in 2002

Lookers: Ukrainian fans at Euro 2012 were likely to be better looking than most, especially if from Kiev, according to a new list of the top ten cities with the most beautiful women

In praising its population the online magazine notes: 'A visit to Kiev is truly awe-inducing and it’s almost hard to believe that women this beautiful even exist.

'And for anyone who thinks that beautiful women must be vapid as well, Ukrainian women are ready to disprove that theory.

'The women in the country are well educated and always ready to talk about literature or philosophy.'

Russia's team was also knocked out in the group stage to the Greek team, who are renown for winning ugly on the pitch.

Close call: Stockholm born actress Malin Akerman (right) comes from the city named as having the second best looking women in the world, while Swedish football fans proved pretty as a picture at Euro 2012

But men in Moscow were more likely 
than most to have a beautiful shoulder to cry on, with their city rated 
as having the world's sixth most attractive females.

Travelers Digest's says: 'This may surprise the cold-war generation who grew up believing the stereotypes of Russian women being plain and ordinary.

'A quick visit to Moscow should set you straight on that front. Think tall, blonde or brunette and blue-eyed goddesses.

'That’s not to say these girls are easy to talk to; Russians can be an intimidating bunch.'

Natural beauty: Israeli model Bar Refaeli is an example for the beauty's found in the country's capital Tel Aviv

Argentinian actress Luisana Lopilato (right), wife of singer Michael Buble and model for Ultimo, comes from the country whose capital Buenos Aires was named as having the world's fourth most beautiful women and Russian beauty Irina Shayk (left), who goes out with Real Madrid and Portugal star Ronaldo, who comes from Russia whose capital Moscow came sixth on the list

Stockholm is on the second on this list, with the website saying: 'What you have seen on the beer commercials is true; Sweden really does 
have some of the world’s most beautiful women.

'The streets of Stockholm 
are literally packed with these gorgeous women, who are as tall as they 
are luscious.

'Even better, is that Scandinavians are world renowned for 
their friendliness, so there’s a good chance that the girl you’re eyeing
 is actually a sweet and down to earth person.'

The only American city that makes the list is third placed New York.

Talent: Former Russian spy Anna Chapman, 30, photographed last month was deported from the U.S. and appeared on Moscow catwalks after finding her good looks were better suited to modelling than espionage

The website notes: 'New York was a close
 call for the number-one spot. Because New York is a melting pot of so 
many different cultures and ethnicities, the city has some of the most 
diverse and beautiful women in the world.

'The
 clubs in the Meatpacking District are packed full of models, and 
Brooklyn has enough cute hipster chicks to fill a thousand Apple 
stores.'
