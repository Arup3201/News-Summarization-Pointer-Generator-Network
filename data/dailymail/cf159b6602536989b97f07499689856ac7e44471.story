A British hostage who was killed by his captors in Nigeria during a rescue mission by UK special forces 'always made people feel special', mourners at his funeral heard today.

More than 600 people gathered to pay their respects to Chris McManus, 28, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, who was killed earlier this month.

Mr McManus and Italian co-worker Franco Lamolinara died on March 8 as Nigerian troops and UK Special Boat Service (SBS) commandos tried to end their captivity.

Great sadness: The body of Chris McManus is taken into his funeral service today. He died earlier this month while being held hostage in Nigeria

The
deaths of both men sparked a diplomatic spat between London and Rome, 
with Italian politicians complaining they had not been told of the 
rescue operation until it was under way.

In a eulogy to Mr McManus read out on their 
behalf at Oldham’s Our Lady of Mount Carmel and St Patrick RC Church, 
his parents Michael and Laura said:

'He
felt lucky in making friends in all areas of his life. He was able to 
establish long-lasting friendships without understanding this was his 
knack.

'He treasured his family. He loved us all so much.

'He always made people feel so special and we feel privileged that we knew him.'

They added that he loved his girlfriend, Katy, 'so much'.

'We know that when he was kidnapped his foremost thoughts would have been with Katy,' they said.

Girlfriend: Katy Bailey gave an emotional tribute to her 'soulmate' and revealed they planned to marry

'He wanted to offer Katy the best life and future possible. We know he would still wish that for her.'

Katy Bailey, 24, wept as she waved an emotional goodbye to her 
'soulmate'.

She said: 'He was the love of my life and I'll never 
stop loving him' and revealed that the couple planned to marry.

Mr McManus’s sister, Justine, told 
the congregation: 'Chris always made the most of everything. He saw the 
positives that others could not.

'Chris’s interest in the wide world and his sense of adventure led him to some magnificent places and friends.'

Together with brother Benet, she concluded: 'We are the people we are today because of you.'

Officiating the service, Father Phil 
Sumner said: 'It is a terrible occasion yet one on which the family feel
touched that the church is full of people concerned. People concerned 
as family, as friends, as a town.'

He said it had been 'a pleasure' to 
have got to know Mr McManus’s family in the last few weeks.

He revealed how the family would all 
meet up on the 12th of each month - following his capture on May 12 last
year - and talk to each other and lend support.

The priest continued: 'The family 
told me as well there was a Muslim cleric who tried to intervene for 
Chris and was killed for having the audacity to do so.

'Chris was so thankful for the relationship he had with the Nigerian people whatever their background, except in his capture.

'He was blessed with so many relationships in his life.

'He felt so so lucky in the relationships and love he had in that he was able to reach out to others because of it.'

Speaking before his funeral today, his family praised those who had tried to rescue him for their 'determination and bravery'.

They said: 'Today is a sad and emotional
day for our entire family as we say goodbye to Chris. But it is also a 
day for us to celebrate Chris’s life and remember our loving son, 
brother, boyfriend and true friend to many.

'Chris
was all about love and he lived his life to the full. He loved to 
travel and enjoyed experiencing new countries and meeting new people.

'We often talked about where he had been. One particular favourite was a family trip down the Nile.'

A passionate Oldham Athletic Football 
Club supporter, he could regularly be seen on the terraces cheering on 
his team, they said.

They went on: 'Chris went to Nigeria to gain professional experience and was welcomed like a family member by his employer and colleagues at B Stabilini & Co.

'He loved Nigeria and the people and made many friends in the country.'

The family professed themselves 'overwhelmed' by the support they had received from friends and relatives in the wake of the tragedy.

They added: 'We know how much everyone thought of our Chris.

In love: Katy Bailey, 24, right, wept as she waved an emotional goodbye to her 'soulmate' today. She said: 'He was the love of my life and I'll never stop loving him'

Fun-loving: Mr McManus' parents Michael and Laura told mourners at the funeral that when he was kidnapped his 'foremost thoughts' would have been with Katy, his girlfriend

'He had a positive and happy outlook on life and everyone who met and knew Chris will know that he had a heart of gold and always had time to help anyone in need.

'We know that many people both here and in Nigeria worked hard to free Chris. We are grateful for their determination and the bravery of those who tried to rescue him.

Time to remember: The Order of Service for Chris McManus' funeral today

'There have been far too many people involved over the past 10 months to thank individually. They know who they are and we thank them all most sincerely.

'Chris would have been proud to know that every effort was made to try and bring him home.'

Mr McManus, a contract worker for the construction company B.Stabilini, was kidnapped by a 'horde of gunmen' in May last year.

Raiders stormed his apartment in Birnin-Kebbi, in the north-west of the country, and captured him along with Mr Lamolinara.

The men were in the city to build a bank.

In December a Nigerian group calling itself Al Qaida in the land beyond the Sahil announced it had captured Mr McManus.

It
released a hostage video to a news agency claiming it had kidnapped the
Briton and showed a blindfolded and bearded man in an orange vest.

It
was reported that the man pictured in the video called for the British 
Government to respond to the demands of the group, so they would spare 
his life. The Government said those demands were never coherent.

Violent end: This is the house where Chris McManus and Italian Franco Lamolinara were killed by their captors when British-backed Nigerian troops surrounded their compound in the Nigerian city of Sokoto

Resistance: Gun shot holes can be seen surrounding a doorway at the house

Grim: Youths look out from the compound where the two hostages were being held. The barred windows are marked with large bullet holes

The bid to rescue Mr McManus and Italian co-worker Franco Lamolinara was 
apparently brought forward because the kidnappers became aware that 
the net was closing around them.

There were reports of a fierce firefight after a house in the north-western town of Sokoto was surrounded.

The men's bodies were found by the 
troops in a room at the rear of the compound. They are believed to have 
been shot by automatic gun fire from their captors.

Britain
and Italy announced plans yesterday to set up a joint counter-terrorism
group to improve co-operation in light of the incident.

Among those present at today's service was Mr McManus's boss at B.Stabilini.

Mourners were told of the quantity surveyor's love of his home football team, Oldham Athletic, and also listening to music and reading.

Among the hobbies listed in his order of service were 'learning to play the guitar' and 'not interested in cooking but loved to eat'.

Hymns sang were Do not be afraid; I watch the Sunrise and Walk with me O my lord.

His girlfriend, Katy Bailey, gave a reading of David Harkins' 'Remember Me'.

Music played was 'Teardrop' by Massive Attack and 'Here Comes The Sun' by The Beatles.

People were asked to donate to Amnesty International - Mr McManus's chosen charity - as they left the service.

A private burial followed.
