The Tetley tea folk, those bluff northerners who sing the benefits of their round teabags, have suffered a nasty blow after taking on PG Tips and their pyramid bags - and losing.

Executives at the company behind the plain speaking popular cartoon characters were furious after their rivals appeared to trash their round teabags in a fun TV commercial.

PG Tips and their brand ambassadors, comedian Jonny Vegas and his monkey puppet, suggested that their pyramid tea bags were better at letting the flavour flood out than round ones.

The Advertising Standards Authority launched an investigation after PG Tips and their brand ambassadors, comedian Jonny Vegas and his monkey puppet (pictured), suggested that their pyramid tea bags were better

Tetley complained to the Advertising Standards Authority that this attack on their popular product was both unfair and untrue.

However, in a ruling published today the watchdog has sided with PG Tips and decided that Tetley and its tea folk were simply wrong.

Significantly, it accepted that the PG Tips pyramid bags really are better at releasing the flavour than the round ones promoted by Tetley’s characters in their flat caps.

The decision could have serious consequences, for it may be enough to convince the nation’s tea lovers to switch to PG Tips and its superior bags.

The ASA said the commercial featured the comedian and the puppet monkey in a kitchen comparing the performance of the PG Tips pyramid bag against a round one.

Vegas said: ‘Monkey, you know how you always say, ‘there’s no other tea to beat PG’ … What if you’re lying?’

Research showed the leaves in a pyramid bag had 77 per cent more room to move than in a round one

The monkey then set about proving his point and made two cups of tea, one with a pyramid bag and one with a round bag and stated: ‘PG Tips uses pyramid bags, so if we test one against a regular tea bag ... you’ll see the tea has got more room to move, freeing the great fresh taste for a perfect cuppa.’

Tetley is owned by the Indian company, Tata Global Beverages, which complained the images exaggerated the performance of the PG Tips pyramid bags. It challenged the claim the tea has more room to move so ‘freeing the great fresh taste’

It also argued that the comparison with a round teabag ‘denigrated’ the Tetley brand – even though it was not named - and portrayed it in a negative light.

PG Tips, which is owned by Unilever, countered by offering evidence of tests comparing the performance of different bags in hot water after 40 seconds and two minutes of brewing. Both showed a win for the pyramid over round, in terms of colour and strength.

Separate research showed the leaves in a pyramid bag had 77per cent more room to move than in a round one.

PG Tips insisted the commercial was not meant to be seen as a direct comparison to Tetley because round teabags are also offered by other brands and supermarkets.

Backing PG Tips, the ASA said: ‘Unilever provided test results which showed that the infusion of tea, at 40 seconds and two minutes into brewing, was greater when using a pyramid teabag than when using a round teabag. We therefore concluded that the ad did not exaggerate the capability and performance of the advertised product and was not misleading.

‘Unilever provided relevant modelling and measurements to demonstrate that the tea in the pyramid teabag would have more room to move… and that the pyramid teabag had a greater brewing efficiency than the round teabag.’

Tetley, which is owned by the Indian company Tata Global Beverages, complained the performance of the PG Tips pyramid bags had been exaggerated and challenged the claim the tea has more room to move

The watchdog added: ‘While a large portion of round teabags were owned by Tetley, we considered that consumers would not immediately identify a round teabag as being a Tetley teabag.

'Because we considered that the comparison was not made with an identifiable competitor, we concluded that the ad did not denigrate Tetley.’

A spokesman for PG Tips said: ‘We’re thrilled that the ASA have agreed with what PG Tips fans have known for years, pyramid bags really do make the best cup of tea.’

Tetley had no one was available to comment on the ruling.
