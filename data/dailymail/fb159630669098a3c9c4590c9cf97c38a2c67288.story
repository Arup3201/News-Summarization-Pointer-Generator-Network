Businessman Ronald Stocker is not the first man to ‘trade his wife in’ for a younger model.

But the multi-millionaire’s ex-wife – the mother of his 13-year-old son – opted for a decidedly 21st Century revenge.

Instead of giving away the 63-year-old property developer’s favourite claret or chopping up his suits, Nicola Stocker took to the social media website Facebook to provide her rival with a devastating critique of him.

Devastating critique: Nicola Stocker posted messages on the Facebook page of her ex-husband's new partner Deborah Bligh which accused him of trying to strangle her. Miss Bligh subsequently ended the relationship

After finding Deborah Bligh’s online page, the 46-year-old equestrian posted a series of damning messages – visible to all Miss Bligh’s Facebook friends – in which she said her ex-husband had tried to strangle her and was a love cheat.

‘I hear you have been together 2 years?’ she wrote. ‘If so u might like to ask him who he was in bed with the last time he was arrested.

‘Wouldn’t bring it up. Last time I accused him of cheating he spent a night in the cells, tried to strangle me. Police don’t take too kindly to finding your wife with your hand prints round her neck.’

In a barbed sign-off, she added: ‘But don’t worry, you will get a nice watch for Christmas!’

The withering messages were read in horror by Miss Bligh, a divorced mother of two.

Court action: Ronald Stocker has, in response, issued a £150,000 writ for libel in the High Court against his ex-wife, which she intends to defend

But Ms Stocker – who had never met the younger woman – had more to say.

She emailed Miss Bligh’s ex-husband too, saying she believed Mr Stocker had ‘deep psychological problems and anger management issues’.

She also wrote: ‘He likes to watch porn and leaves the television on all night.’

This, apparently, proved the final straw for Miss Bligh, who walked out on Mr Stocker.

As a result, the businessman has issued a £150,000 writ for libel in the High Court against his former wife, which she intends to defend.

Mr Stocker, who lives in a £2 million detached house in Aston Clinton, Buckinghamshire, admits that his 2012 divorce – after 14 years of marriage – was ‘acrimonious’.

His ex-wife, a professional event rider who runs her own stables, lives 20 minutes away, in her own £2.5 million detached property. She is currently being treated for breast cancer.

Mr Stocker admits in the writ that, since May 2011, before his divorce, he had been in a relationship with Miss Bligh.

But he claims that the email sent to Miss Bligh’s ex-husband last year implied that he was ‘a dangerous and thoroughly disreputable man’ as well as being ‘a vile, angry misogynist, who was psychologically unwell and unfit to look after children’.

Ms Stocker, however, stands by her accusations and, according to her lawyer, vigorously contests her ex’s counter-claims.

Mr Stocker is also seeking aggravated 
damages due to ‘the gratuitous nature of her communications with Deborah
 Bligh’. The posts were apparently widely read, causing Mr Stocker 
‘embarrassment and stress’.

A close friend of Mr Stocker said: ‘Ronald offered Nicola the chance to apologise and withdraw the comments. Ronald has now split up with Deborah because of all this. The incident that Nicola brought up was over 12 years ago. They were having an argument and Ronald put his hand over her mouth to stop her shouting because he thought it would wake their baby son Joshua up.’

David Price QC, representing Ms Stocker, said: ‘The court has ordered the claim to be put on hold as my client is receiving treatment for breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy on Wednesday.

‘But for this delay my client would either have applied to  strike out the claim or served a defence which would have set out her case.’
