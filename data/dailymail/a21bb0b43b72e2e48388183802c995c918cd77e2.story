A British tourist thought he was going to die after he was bitten by a deadly spider in Mexico which can cause organ failure.

Bobbi Harris, 31, had been holidaying in Cancun, Mexico, with his girlfriend, Tina, when he felt something bite him in bed. 

To his horror, when he pulled back the covers he discovered an inch-long spider had injected poisonous venom into his leg.

Tina managed to trap the spider in a glass which experts later identified as a brown recluse - a deadly venomous spider which can cause organ failure. 

Mr Harris, who already had a phobia of spiders, was rushed to hospital and given an injection for the swelling.

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, he said: 'When I got home I took off the bandages and there was a disgusting green lump. 

'It kept weeping lumps of tissue and I could see down to my bone. The venom was eating at my skin.'

Sore: Mr Harris needed to take a month off work after he was bitten by the spider causing his leg to weep

The pair missed their flight home and Mr Harris, a tiler, from Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, needed to take a month off work. 

He has also been left with a huge scar on his leg. 

'That is one holiday I will never forget,' he said.

The brown recluse, or Loxosceles reclusa, is one of the most feared spiders in North America. 

Its bite can kill a child under seven and anyone with a weakened immune system.

When provoked, or squished up against the skin by accident, the brown recluse injects a powerful venom that can kill.

In some cases the bite can kill the skin tissues at its site, leading to painful sores and deep scarring.

A brown recluse has a dark brown violin shape on the part of the body where the legs attach.

It also has six eyes in pairs, but most spiders have eight eyes in two rows of four.
