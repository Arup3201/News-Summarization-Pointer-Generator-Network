It's something you think would never happen to you.

This is the moment a 'Peeping Tom' was caught on video, peering through the window of a 37-year-old woman's apartment whilst she was in the shower.

The victim of this creepy incident set up cameras after her boyfriend had previously confronted the same man twice for lurking in the bushes outside her Boston apartment.

When confronted by the woman's boyfriend, the 'Peeping Tom' insisted he was looking for his dog, the Boston Globe reports.

At the time of recording, the woman, who lives alone, was taking a shower.

'After I got out of the shower ... I decided to check the camera and all of a sudden I saw the footage of a man peering through my bedroom window while I was in the shower a few windows down,' she told the Boston Globe.

Bound to give anyone goosebumps, the video documents the face of the man as he slowly makes his way closer and closer to the woman's bedroom window, before quickly disappearing.

'It's terrifying to see someone so close... where I sleep, it is horrifying,' she added.
