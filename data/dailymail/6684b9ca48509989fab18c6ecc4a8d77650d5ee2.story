The EU’s disastrous Common Fisheries Policy suffered a blow last night after MEPs gave local fishing groups more control over the seas.

Campaigners hailed a victory against ‘micro-managers’ in Brussels after MEPs voted for reform. A ban on the scandalous practice of discarding dead fish also moved a step closer to completion.

The Common Fisheries Policy was originally adopted in the name of protecting depleted stocks

Reform: MEPs voted for reform of European fisheries policy that would hand more power to regional fishing organisations

It has handed control over Britain’s historic fishing rights to other member states and potentially cost the country billions in lost jobs and revenue.

Fishermen are forced to dump hundreds of thousands of tons of dead fish into the North Sea because it is illegal to land them.

Some British politicians have called for the policy to be scrapped completely, arguing that every country enforces the rules differently.

MEPs stopped short of total repatriation, but agreed to hand more powers to regional fishing organisations.

Measures approved in the vote included a ban on the practice of dumping dead fish back in the sea, which should now come into force within three years.

The final stage of the deal will involve negotiations between MEPs, EU fisheries ministers and the European Commission in June.

No control: Centralised control over Britain¿s historic fishing rights, with decisions made by other member states, has potentially cost the country billions in lost jobs and revenue

Scottish Conservative MEP Struan Stevenson said the deal would ‘wrest control away from the micro-managers in Brussels who have made such an absolute mess of fisheries policy for the past 30 years’.

He added: ‘We will also see an urgent timetable set for an absolute ban on the scandal of dumping and discards.

‘Every vote counted, but I believe the public would never have forgiven MEPs if we had failed to take this opportunity to stop the discards debacle.’

UKIP MEP Stuart Agnew, who is also the party’s fisheries representative, said the Common Fisheries Policy was ‘one of the EU’s biggest disasters to date’.

Celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall said he hoped the decision will 'be seen as a historic turning point in Europe¿s fisheries management'

The National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations said the package would result in a ‘more rational and effective fisheries policy’.

Celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall highlighted the issue as part of his Fish Fight series and encouraged viewers to petition Europe.

Writing on his blog yesterday, he said: ‘It’s fantastic news that MEPs in the European Parliament voted today for a strong discards ban and a legally-binding end to overfishing.

‘I hope in years to come this will be seen as a historic turning point in Europe’s fisheries management.
