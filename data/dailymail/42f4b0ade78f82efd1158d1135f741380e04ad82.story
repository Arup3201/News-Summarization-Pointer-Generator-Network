Council planners have banned a grandfather from selling his flowers outside his village home in aid of a children’s charity - in case the colourful displays distract passing driver.

Award-winning gardener Joe Poultney, 69, donates hundreds of pounds made from the sale of his flowers to a local children’s hospice and his village church every year.

But he was stunned when bureaucrats from Stafford Borough Council ordered him to stop selling the plants - claiming the vibrant display distracted motorists.

Colourful display: Pensioner Joe Poultney, has been ordered to stop selling flowers outside his home in Barlaston, Staffordshire, in case it distracts passing drivers

Congestion: Stafford Borough Council said it received the complaints that the selling of plants from the house on Tittensor Road in Barlaston was causing traffic problems

The pensioner has now been told he must spend £385 to register a planning application for permission to continue selling the blooms outside his home in Barlaston, Staffordshire.

Mr Poultney originally started giving away his plants for free but now charges just £1 for a tray of six.

Despite donating all the money to charity, he was told he needs to register as a business because he has altered the use of his property.

He said: 'This whole episode makes me feel quite sad because I won’t be able to give as much money to the children’s charity and the church as I did last year.

Dedication: Mr Poultney spends three hours every single day just watering his prize-winning plants

'I have always been interested in gardening and I grow a lot plants in my garden as a hobby now I have retired.

'At first I gave any excess plants I had to other residents in the village and then more people asked me whether I could sell some to them.

'If there were any left, I usually sold them for about £1 for a tray of six. It was never intended to be a business.

'I
know the council is worried it might cause problems with congestion on 
the road, they even told me the colourful displays could distract 
drivers which could cause accidents.

'I have always asked people to park around the corner where Barlaston Methodist Chapel is and I walk to give them their plants.

'I also donate some money to the church for them letting me use the car park.

'It’s ridiculous, I don’t run a garden centre, it is just killjoy council officials.'

Mr
Poultney has even received an award from Barlaston Parish Council for 
making a valuable contribution to the community for his attractive 
garden.

He donates his 
profits to the Donna Louise Children’s Hospice Trust and has received 
thank you letters from the charity and Barlaston Methodist Chapel.

It
takes Mr Poultney, who gardens with his wife Heather, 67, three hours 
to water his plants as well nurturing their hundreds of seedlings.

Mr
Poultney, who has two sons and two grandchildren, added: 'I only really
sell the plants at weekends and normally get up to six people coming in
a day so I don’t understand why it would cause problems.

'The ironic thing is I won an award 
two years ago from Barlaston Parish Council for making a valuable 
contribution to the community for having such a nice, well-kept garden.

'It takes three hours to water the garden every other day and my wife helps me. We spend hours out there every day.'

Expensive hobby: Mr Poultney, who donated all the money made by the sale of his plants, has been told he must pay £385 to apply for planning permission if he wishes to continue selling them

Neighbours also backed his planning fight and said there was never any traffic congestion outside his house.

Peter Hulme, 58, said: 'I don’t think Joe is causing any problems by selling plants from his house.

'Most of his customers come on foot to the house and it is not very often that I see cars parked outside his house.

'Joe has a lovely garden and it is a real asset for the community to have something as nice as that here.'

A spokesman for Stafford Borough Council said: 'We had a complaint that the selling of plants from a house was causing traffic problems.

'We visited the owner and told him he needs permission to be allowed to sell from the property.'
