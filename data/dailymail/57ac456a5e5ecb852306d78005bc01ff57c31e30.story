You could say that Luke Sharples has followed in his father’s flight path.

The 24-year-old became an airline pilot just like his father, John, and the pair achieved a major milestone today they flew their first commercial flight together.

It was a proud moment for the father-son duo, who work for Luton-based Monarch Airlines and were behind the controls as they flew passengers from Birmingham to Turin, Italy.

John served as captain and Luke as first officer on the flight, which was made even more special by the fact that it coincided with John’s 56th birthday.

Thanks to his father’s job Luke was given access to places that most children can only dream of, and it led him on a path towards becoming a pilot.

He said: ‘Dad really is my inspiration when it comes to flying. Aviation was all I knew from a young age.

‘The house was full of books that were either flying related or an aviation manual of some kind. I started logging flying hours towards my pilot’s license from the age of 14 and I was flying before I could drive.’

He added: ‘I was very fortunate to have seen so much of the world and industry growing up, going away on trips with dad and back then, before the "locked flight deck door" policy, I was sat in the flight deck watching it all first hand.

'I’ve tried other jobs in different industries but nothing compares to flying.’

The father-son flight occurred nearly 25 years to the day that Luke was born.

That night, John was a pilot on a Monarch flight from Madrid to London’s Gatwick Airport and joined his wife at the hospital just 15 minutes before Luke arrived.

During the flight he received a call from operations staff, who asked him when the aircraft would be landing.

He thought the question was unusual until he landed at Gatwick and learned that his wife, Liz, was in labour.

John said: ‘Unbeknown to me operations had kindly arranged for a taxi to be waiting to whisk me to the hospital where Luke was born 15 minutes after I arrived.’

John joined Monarch from British Midland in 1986 and has flown its fleet of Boeing 757s and 767s.

When Monarch’s 757s were retired last year, he flew one of the final three planes remaining from Mallorca to Birmingham.

Luke obtained his private pilot licence in 2007 at the age of 17 and later studied in New Zealand before he joined Monarch as a cadet on its Airbus A320 and 321 fleet in 2012.

They were able to fly together after John retrained on the British carrier's Airbus fleet.

The pair's first commercial flight together, from Birmingham to Turin, coincided with John's 56th birthday

John said: ‘What a unique and wonderful way to celebrate my 56th birthday. This flight will be a little strange for me in that I am still quite new to this type of aircraft, although I have over 21,000 flying hours.

‘Luke will be the more experienced pilot on the Airbus. I will be expecting some constructive criticism.’

Luke added: ’It has been an aspiration to be able to fly with him. It has taken a long time and a lot of luck but finally I can tick off one of my major life goals.

‘Knowing how hard and long I have worked for this opportunity to fly with my dad makes it very exciting.’
