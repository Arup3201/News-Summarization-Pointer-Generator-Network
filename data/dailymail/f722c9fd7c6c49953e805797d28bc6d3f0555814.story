The mighty Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland's Highlands began erupting on August 29 last year. 

Five months on, it is still going, producing a lava-field spanning around fifty miles.

Lava over 40-feet deep is seeping out of the volcano while the concentration of sulphur dioxide has, at times, been so high that the Icelandic authorities have urged local residents to stay indoors. 

The Holuhraun eruption, in Iceland, began in August 29, 2014, and is continuing to seep lava and emit sulphuric ash clouds

Icelandic scientists are uncertain about what the future may hold for the eruption. 

Some predict it could go on for a matter of months while others argue it could develop into a potentially more disruptive ash-producing eruption.

The 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption grounded over 100,000 international flights and cost airlines more than £2 billion.

The eruption has caused no disruption to flights, unlike the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption which grounded over 100,000 international flights

The Icelandic eruption, which began north of the Bárðarbunga caldera, is now in its fifth months

Dutch photographer, Robert Meerding, took these incredible photographs in October, during two flights in a six-person fixed wing aircraft.

As the photographs were taken over two flights, Robert has  captured the magnificence of the eruption, by day, showing the incredible scope of the ash cloud, and by night,  showing the lava-field in all its lit up glory.

Robert said: 'We flew along the edge of the lava field so we had a good view of the eruption itself. It was a bumpy ride. The lava emits so much heat that there's naturally a lot of turbulence.'

'It was a bumpy ride. The lava emits so much heat that there's naturally a lot of turbulence,' said Meerding of the flight above the volcano

'What surprised me was the viscosity of the lava: it looked like boiling water and it moved at an incredible speed,' added the photographer

The biggest hazard produced by the eruption so far has been to the air quality in Iceland

Lava over 40-feet deep is continuing to seep out of the volcano, which began to erupt in August, 2014

'As the sun sets you can see lava glowing that you can't see at daylight,' said the photographer, Robert Meerding

 Robert said: 'To me it was an amazing experience, especially the evening flight.

'As the sun sets you can see lava glowing that you can't see at daylight and the light emitted by the eruption itself is amazing too.' 

He added: 'What surprised me was the viscosity of the lava: it looked like boiling water and it moved at an incredible speed.

'I can see why it might be a scary experience for some people but, for me, it was thrilling. I loved every minute of it.'
