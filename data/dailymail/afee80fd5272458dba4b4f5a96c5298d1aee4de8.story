England have wrapped Jimmy Anderson in cotton wool by ruling him out of their one-day tour of Sri Lanka to safeguard his fitness for the World Cup.

England’s prize bowling asset was troubled by his left knee during the summer and was still feeling it when he joined up with the rest of the 50-over squad on Tuesday at the start of their three-day training camp in Loughborough.

Now he will miss the seven-match one-day series in Sri Lanka, which starts on November 26, along with his strike partner Stuart Broad, who is still recovering from an operation on his right knee.

First ODI - November 26, Colombo (9am BST)

Second ODI - November 29, Colombo (4.30am)

Third ODI - December 3, Hambantota (9am)

Fourth ODI - December 6, Colombo (4.30am)

Fifth ODI - December 10, Pallekele (9am)

Sixth ODI - December 13, Pallekele (4.30am)

Seventh ODI - December 16, Colombo (9am)

England remain confident that both will be fit and ready for the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in February but there will remain a question mark over both crucial figures until they are ready to bowl again.

Anderson has now been told to rest but hopes to continue his recovery in South Africa before Christmas with the England Performance Programme and if all goes well he will return for the triangular series that precedes the World Cup.

England do not plan to call up a replacement to face Sri Lanka, meaning more opportunities for the likes of Steven Finn, Chris Jordan, Chris Woakes and all-rounder Ben Stokes.

However, not having a bowler who has taken 257 wickets in 184 one-day internationals is a blow to England’s hopes of upsetting Sri Lanka in their own conditions in a crucial segment of their World Cup preparations.
