Derek Percy, who died last year, has been found guilty of the death of a Melbourne child 

Convicted child killer Derek Percy is responsible for the death of seven-year-old Melbourne girl Linda Stilwell who vanished 46 years ago, an inquest has found. 

Percy had demonstrated a capacity to commit a heinous act and his writings demonstrate an intent in torturing, killing and mutilating children, Victoria's deputy state coroner Iain West found.

'It is highly unlikely that another child molester was in the vicinity when Linda disappeared,' Mr West said.

'I am satisfied it is more probable that Derek Percy would have taken advantage of an opportunity presenting itself than anyone in the vicinity not so affected by such a rare and dangerous condition.'

Mr West said witness descriptions of a man seen loitering near Linda before she vanished matched Percy's appearance at the time, and witness descriptions of the vehicle matched the one Percy drove.

Linda disappeared from the St Kilda foreshore near Melbourne's Luna Park on August 10, 1968.

Mr West made an interim finding in 2009 that Percy was in the area at the time.

At the time of his death in July last year, 64-year-old Percy was Victoria's longest serving prisoner and had been linked to child killings in four states.

He abducted and killed 12-year-old Yvonne Tuohy in Victoria in 1969, but was found not guilty on the grounds of insanity and ordered to remain in jail indefinitely.

Mr West on Thursday said he took into consideration a statement from Professor James Ogloff, who said Yvonne was unlikely to have been Percy's first attack.

Yvonne was killed 11 months after Linda disappeared. 

In an emergency bedside hearing before he died, Percy denied any involvement in Linda's disappearance, despite earlier saying he couldn't remember.

'Percy had a capacity to make false denials, as was demonstrated in the Yvonne Tuohy case,' Mr West said.

He formally found Linda Stilwell was deceased, having met her death by foul play.

'I find that Derek Percy caused the death of Linda Stilwell,' Mr West said.

Linda's mother Jean Priest broke down as Mr West delivered his findings.

Mrs Priest, who fought for years to have Percy say what happened to Linda, says the family has been through hell, but the coroner's ruling feels like closure.

'We just hope that eventually someone will find her remains so that we can give her a decent funeral and show her the respect she deserves,' Ms Priest says.

'But this has been marvellous today ... a form of closure, yes.

'I would have liked to have got the full answers, but it doesn't look as though we'll ever get them.'

Victoria Police Detective Senior Sergeant Wayne Newman, who worked on the Stilwell cold case, said he has no doubt that Percy would have gone on to kill again had he been released.
