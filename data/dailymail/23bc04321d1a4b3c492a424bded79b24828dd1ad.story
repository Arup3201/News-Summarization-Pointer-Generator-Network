Edward Doyle has been charged with endangering children after he fell on his two-month-old daughter who later died, according to court documents

A 28-year-old man has been charged with endangering children after his two-month-old daughter died over the weekend.

Edward Doyle, 28, of Philadelphia, was taken into custody Sunday, according to the Montgomery County District Attorney's Office, reportsÂ The Philadelphia Enquirer, after the death of his daughter Makayla.

Makayla was found unresponsive in the family's apartment on Sunday morning, according to court documents. She was taken to Hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

Police say her death is still under investigation and an autopsy is underway.

Officers who arrived at the home saw 'red swelling on Makayla's forehead and bruising and cuts on the bridge of her nose', according to court documents.

Doyle told detectives he was carrying the child and hit a baby swing in the living room while he was walking. He fell and landed on top of her, according to the documents.

He then checked to see if the girl was still breathing and put her in the baby swing, adding that he 'drank too much' and shouldn't have been caring for the child.

The night before Doyle had been out for a friend's birthday celebration and drank six beers, returning home in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Doyle initially told police that Makayla was in the baby swing when he went to sleep. After he woke up he found her 'white as a ghost' and 'limp' and called 911.

He later told detectives that he fell on her and said he had picked up Makayla because she was crying, adding that he checked on the child at about 7.15am and gave her a pacifier, though he was 'groggy' at the time.

He is being held on $1million bail.
