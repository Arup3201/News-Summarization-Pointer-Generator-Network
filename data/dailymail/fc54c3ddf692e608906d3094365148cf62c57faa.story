An 8-year-old boy has written a heartfelt letter to Santa Claus asking for help to stop his twin sister from being bullied at school.

Mom Karen Suffern said she wept openly when she read the letter written by her son Ryan in which he told Santa he was willing to forgo any Christmas presents this year if the bullies would leave his sister alone.

Ryan and twin sister Amber have just started in the third grade at Rocky Mount Preparatory in North Carolina.

Mom Karen Suffern said she wept openly when she read the letter her son Ryan had written in which he told Santa he was willing to forgo any Christmas presents this year if the bullies at school would leave his sister Amber alone

At 140 pounds, Amber is almost twice the size of her brother. Her mom says she has attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder and other mental and mood disorders - and is an emotional eater.

Ryan’s letter to Santa started off normally: ‘Dear Santa… I wanted a (remote control) car and helicopter, but I don’t want that anymore (sic).  

'Kid at school are still picking on Amber and its (sic) not fair,’ he wrote. ‘I prayed that they will stop but god is bisy (sic) and needs your help.’

Ryan wrote the touching letter after single mom Suffern had asked her kids to write to Santa so she could get an idea of what presents they wanted for Christmas.

Dear Santa,

My mom said to send you a Christmas list. I wanted a remote control car and helicopter but I do not want that anymore.

Kids at school are still picking on Amber and it is not fair because she does not do anything to them and it makes me mad.

I prayed they would stop, but God is busy and I need your help.

Is it against the rules to give up gifts early?

Can you ask Big Time Rush to come to Amber’s birthday party? It will make her so happy.

If you do not get them to come that is fine, just get her everything she asked for.

Thanks Santa,

Love Ryan

PS- My mom throws the best birthday parties. You can come if you want.

Suffern said she had a vague idea her daughter was being teased, but reading Ryan’s letter she had opened her eyes to what her daughter was dealing with on a daily basis.

‘I try to build up my daughter's self-esteem and tell her she is beautiful, but people say hurtful things to me, because I also have a weight problem, and that hurts me,’ she told CNN. ‘I can't imagine what she goes through.’

Suffern said her daughter has never mentioned being teased, but Ryan has told her that in gym class kids laughed at Amber because she couldn’t do the bear crawl on the floor and that she has been teased in class and told she must be adopted because she is multiracial.

‘Every day when she goes to school, she says, “Mommy, can I just stay at home?” and she just doesn't want to go.’ And now every time I send her to school, I feel like I am not protecting her and I am letting her down,’ Suffern said.

She decided to share he son’s letter 
online with some friends including Tony Posanski, who blogs about weight
 loss after losing more than 200 pounds himself.

Posnanski said he was moved by Ryan's letter because it reminded him of his childhood.

Now that Ryan's letter has shed new light on Amber's situation, their mom plans to speak to their teachers and the parents of the bullies at school.

'If my kids don't call names and pick on others, I would expect other parents to teach their kids to be respectful, too,' she told CNN.

'There have been times my kids would point at others and say, "why is her hair so strange" and things like that, and I would say, "You know, people are different, and that is just the way they are.'"
