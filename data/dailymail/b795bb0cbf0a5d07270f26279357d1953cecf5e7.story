Sebastian Vettel has been hit with a five-place grid penalty after Red Bull were forced to change his gearbox.

It means the world champion will start 15th for tomorrow's Spanish Grand Prix after losing drive at the start of the final qualifying session, forcing him to pull his ailing Red Bull over to the side of turn three at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya.

It was another kick in the teeth for the reigning four-times world champion after missing virtually all of Friday's practice sessions due to his car incurring a wiring loom fault.

Blow: Sebastian Vettel has been hit with a five-place penalty after Red Bull were forced to change his gearbox

Asked whether this weekend was a test of his mettle as a driver, Vettel replied: 'Well, I haven't been tested on the track much so far because I haven't driven much.

'It is tough because you would obviously love to get more info about the car, get into a rhythm.

'After missing near enough both practice sessions, I caught up a little in final practice, but then qualifying was tricky.

'In Q3 I left the pits, tried to go up to second (gear), but lost drive.

'I tried third, had third, so I decided to keep going because it is possible to do a lap around here even without second gear.

'But by turn one I was stuck in fifth gear and couldn't go up or down, I had lost all drive, so had to stop.

'These things happen, but now I just have to do the best I can from the position I am in.'

Vettel added: 'With all these reliability issues it's a bit disappointing, and now a bit boring. We've had all sorts of problems this year.

'In practice, unfortunately a very small cable got caught in the wrong place which was impossible to see in putting the car together, but obviously now we know where it belongs.

'Up to that stage you could say we've been lucky because we've never been caught.

'As for today I don't know yet what was the cause. I hope there was no damage to the gearbox otherwise that would mean another penalty for tomorrow.'
