A runner kept herself - and her Instagram followers - entertained during the New York City half marathon by snapping selfies with unsuspecting 'hotties' in the background.

Brooklyn resident Kelly Roberts, 24, spent the bulk of the March 16 race making funny faces in photos she took on her phone, sneakily capturing good-looking fellow runners behind her.

She used the hashtag '#hottguysofthenychalf' for each of the hilarious 13 photos - one for every mile in the race.

Caught in the act: Brooklyn resident Kelly Roberts, 24, spent the bulk of the New York half marathon on March 16 making funny faces in selfies with hotties in the background

Silly series: She used the hashtag '#hottguysofthenychalf' for each of the hilarious 13 photos - one for every mile in the race (pictured at the finish line)

Miss Roberts told Good Morning America that she thought of the idea for the series when she spotted a cute guy running behind her.

'I thought, "Oh my God, I should make a hashtag #hottguysofthenychalf,"' she explained. So each time she saw a good-looking man from afar, she'd sprint to get ahead of him and then snap the shot.

In one photo, she looks wide-eyed at the camera, her mouth agape as she ogles the brown-haired man strolling in the background. 'Oh yeah walker,' she captioned the image.

Another sees her striking a pose at the finish line, her tongue sticking out. In the background are two men in neon T-shirts that seem to have caught her attention.

Inspiration: She'd spot good looking men from afar, sprint to get ahead of them and then snap the shot. 'Ladies and gents I present to you, hott guys of the nyc half,' she captioned this gem

Red-handed: While some of Miss Roberts' subjects appear oblivious to the fact they're in her photos, others stare confusedly at the camera, making for an even more hilarious snap

Number one hottie: Her favorite selfie was with an older man in bright blue shorts, which she captioned: 'Who doesn't love short shorts'

While some of Miss Roberts' subjects appear oblivious to the fact they're in her photos, others stare confusedly at the camera, making for an even more hilarious snap.

In one such photo, she puckers her lips and squints her eyes as the camera focuses in on a man in the background, his brow furrowed as he realizes he's in the shot.

'Dat headband,' Miss Roberts captioned the photo, which amassed 79 'likes'.

On the lookout: Miss Roberts wrote beneath this image: 'Mile 12 eye candy!'

On the run: 'Some beard action for 5,' she said of this bearded runner

No age limit: Miss Roberts pulled a humorous face in front of thsis 'dad' runner

Another one shows her jogging during mile five in front of a man in glasses who seems to notice that she's snapping a selfie. She wrote on this one: 'Some beard action for 5'.

Her favorite selfie, though, was one taken in front of an older man in bright blue shorts, which she captioned: 'Who doesn't love short shorts'.

Miss Roberts explained that this particular 'hottie' was 'a hoot and a half'.

'I love sweaty men!' Nine miles down, she snapped a photo of this man as he went about his business

Tourist attraction: She dubbed this runner 'Times square handsome'

The look of love: Miss Roberts looked particularly excited to see this handsome guy running behind her

Not only did she keep herself entertained by taking pictures, but she also amused her 929 Instagram followers, many of whom shared their thoughts in the comments sections.

'You're hilarious! Mad props for taking selfies WHILE running!' wrote one fan. Another said: 'You are a genius! This is a great idea!'
