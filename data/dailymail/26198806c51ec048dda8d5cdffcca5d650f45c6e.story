Adam Woodyatt, best known for his role as Ian Beale in Eastenders, was over the moon to meet former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry at the National Television Awards on Wednesday.   

Gunners legend Henry, who scored 228 goals in 376 appearances over two separate spells for the North London club, was on stage to present the award for Best Talent show after Eastenders had claimed the gong for Best Serial Drama.

And Woodyatt, despite being a huge Liverpool fan, failed to hide his excitement at sharing the stage with Henry, smiling gleefully and lifting his arms into the air.

'We'd like to accept this for the Weatherfield One,' he said.
