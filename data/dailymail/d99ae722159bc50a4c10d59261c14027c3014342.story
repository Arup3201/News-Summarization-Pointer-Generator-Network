Dr Nemat Shafik said more should be done to punish traders following a series of 'truly shocking evidence'

The woman charged with cleaning up the City of London has launched a stinging attack on ‘outrageous’ behaviour in the financial markets.

Bank of England Deputy Governor Nemat Shafik said last night that more could be done to punish traders following ‘a series of appalling cases of misconduct’ over recent years.

The 52-year-old highlighted ‘truly shocking evidence’ of traders manipulating the prices of everything from gold and oil to lead and coffee, as well as fixing interest rates and currencies.

‘I find this behaviour outrageous,’ she said in her first speech since being brought in by Governor Mark Carney to root out wrongdoing and restore trust in financial markets.

Speaking at the London School of Economics last night, Dr Shafik said: ‘The initial argument that it is just the case of a few bad apples is no longer credible. It seems there were deep-rooted problems.’

Dr Shafik, who studied at the LSE and Oxford and was permanent secretary at the Department for International Development for three years before joining the International Monetary Fund, is now leading a review into the Fixed Income, Currency and Commodity markets (FICC).

She said: ‘It is clear that, in the run-up to the crisis, some firms in FICC markets had allowed the culture on their trading floors to get out of control.’

Egyptian-born Dr Shafik said she was particularly struck at the ‘casual’ attitude of traders involved in the scandals, and that the review she is heading to tackle their ‘anything goes’ attitude should think about imposing harsher punishments.

‘The review wants to consider whether more needs to be done to punish misconduct,’ she said.

She highlighted the case of one Lloyds trader who sent a message to his manager about a request to manipulate Libor interest rates – used to set savings and borrowing rates throughout the economy.

Playing on the Tesco slogan, he joked: ‘Every little helps… it’s like Tesco.’ Dr Shafik pointed out that, far from being concerned, the manager simply replied: ‘Absolutely, every little helps.’

The damning exchange was published by regulators in July as the state-backed lender was fined £217million for rigging Libor. 

Barclays was fined £290million in June 2012 for its part in fixing the rate, and another £26million in May this year for rigging gold prices.

Dr Shafik cited the example of one Lloyd's trader who sent a message to his manager about a request to manipulate Libor interest rates (The Lloyd's Building in the City of London is pictured)

It is also fighting a £300million penalty in the US for manipulating electricity prices.

Dr Shafik, who is known by her nickname Minouche and is arguably the most powerful woman in the City, said progress has been made to clean up the financial markets, including a clampdown on bumper bonuses, however, she added: ‘The risk is that, as memories of recent enforcement cases fade, bad practices may re-emerge. Some say that may already be happening.’

Although the string of financial scandals has cast a shadow over the lenders, not a single senior banker has been jailed.

But the manipulation of the Libor interest rate has now been made a criminal offence carrying a jail term of up to seven years. 

The Government now wants to extend this to cover the rigging of other markets.
