Alabama authorities are investigating what caused an airport sign in a recently renovated space to fall and kill a 10-year old boy and leave his mother in serious condition.

Heather Bresette of Overland Park, Kansas, and several of her children were pinned under a flight display sign weighing 300 to 400 pounds (140 to 180 kg) that fell inside the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport as they traveled home on Friday from a spring break vacation in Florida.

Luke Bresette, 10, was killed. His brother Sam, 8, was in good condition on Monday at the Children's of Alabama hospital, and 5-year-old brother Tyler had been released, said hospital spokeswoman Kathy Bowers.

Heather Bresette suffered a crushed pelvis and two broken ankles, said the family's priest, Father Don Farnan of St. Thomas More parish in Kansas City, Missouri.

'It is horrible. They are trying to 
pick up the pieces and go on with life. Ryan has four other children to 
take care of,' Farnan said of Ryan Bresette, Luke's father.

Airport officials said they would not speculate on the cause of the incident, which remained under investigation.

The probe will include talks with 
contractors and subcontractors who recently updated the part of the 
airport where the sign was hung, airport officials said in a statement. 
The renovated area opened on March 13, said spokeswoman Toni Bast.

Birmingham Mayor William Bell called for a swift review of the 'horrible accident.'

'No parent should have to endure the 
death of their child,' he said. 'I have met with the father, and he is 
heartbroken and wants and deserves answers. I want a full report on my 
desk as quickly as possible.'

Ryan Bresette remembered his son on 
Facebook over the weekend, asking friends and family to wear their 
favorite sports jerseys to church in honor of his sports-loving child.

'He was spunky and energetic and very 
bright. Ornery on occasions,' Farnan said on Monday. 'He had one of 
those faces, that when in trouble, you had a tough time holding him to 
it once he gave you that smile.'

Steve Stine, an assistant city 
attorney, said the flight information display that killed Luke Bresette 
as his family returned home from a Florida beach vacation was a movable 
cabinet containing video monitors that didn't require inspection under 
municipal codes.

He said in emailed response to 
questions from The Associated Press on Tuesday that the unit rested on 
the floor as a free-standing cabinet, similar to a home entertainment 
center.

'The building code does not 
contemplate, and the city does not inspect furniture or cabinetry like 
this object,' Stine said in the email.

The cabinet and monitors, previously 
described by authorities as weighing between 300 and 400 pounds, were 
installed in a recent $201 million terminal upgrade and expansion at 
Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport.

Stine also said inspectors were not required to inspect the display because it was not a structural component of the building.

The family was flying home to Overland
Park, Kansas, after a weeklong beach trip to Destin, Fla., when the 
unit fell in a renovated area of the airport that opened March 13. It's 
unclear what made the display fall.

Neither the Alabama Department of 
Transportation nor Federal Aviation Administration is investigating. 
They lack jurisdiction over airport terminals.

Stine's description of the unit 
matched that of Birmingham real estate manager Albert Osorio, who was 
inside the terminal and helped other men lift it off the child.

'I saw no bolts, nothing holding the thing to the wall at all,' Osorio said. 'It looked like a bookcase up against the wall.'

Osorio said it appeared someone had 
applied heavy-duty construction adhesive to the bottom of the unit in a 
bid to secure it to the terminal floor.

Osorio, who helped hold up the unit 
while others tried to aid the injured, said he has a 10-year-old son of 
his own and was angered by the boy's death. Airport workers did not have
first aid equipment to help the child, he said.

'The city failed this family,' Osorio said.

First responders: The massive flight information board is seen propped up against the wall by rescue workers

Scene: Witnesses reported a loud crash with people screaming in the area before eight to 10 people hurried to lift the massive board off of the family

Rushed away: One of the injured is seen being taken away from the scene on a stretcher

Immediate care: One of the young is taken away from the scene by emergency personnel

Toni Herrera-Bast, a city airport 
authority spokeswoman, said the airport has heart defibrillators for 
cardiac emergencies but relies on Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service for
emergency medical care. Fire Marshal C.W. Mardis said crews arrived 
outside the terminal within five minutes of receiving a 911 emergency 
call.

Herrera-Bast said she did not know 
whether anyone had inspected the flight display before officials opened 
the building to passengers earlier this month. She referred questions to
contractor Brasfield & Gorrie-Bloc Global Services Group of 
Birmingham, which declined comment

'Because of the ongoing evaluation, it
would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time,' the 
company said in a statement.

'The analysis is being conducted with the 
cooperation of the airport authority, design partners and other local 
officials.'

Ryan Bresette, in a public post on his Facebook page, said he and his wife love their children 'more than they will ever know.'

'It is not fair to have to watch the pain on my children's faces,' he wrote.

Closed off: Two workers are seen cleaning in a closed off section of the terminal where the large sign, said to be between 300-400 pounds, fell off the wall

Safety measures: As a precautionary measure barricades have been placed around the airport's other flight status boards, the fallen one is seen here

A witness Tweeting a photo near the scene described it as 'blood everywhere and a mom screaming.'

The terminal has since closed with no word yet on when it will reopen.

Barricades have since been positioned around the airport's other flight status boards as a precautionary measure.

Birmingham's mayor William Bell released a statement immediately after the incident promising his full support in the investigation.

Emergency rescue: Fire trucks rushed to the terminal at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport

Crews: Emergency crews rushed to the scene just after 1.30pm on Friday

'I have offered our full support to the Airport Authority as they 
investigate what has occurred this afternoon. I have asked our public 
safety staff to assist this family in their time of need in any way 
possible as they grapple with what has happened,' the statement read.

The board was in a new terminal of the airport which opened last week following a $201 million modernization effort.
