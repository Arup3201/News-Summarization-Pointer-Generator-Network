Natural disasters across the U.S. are causing death and destruction as wildfires tear through northern Colorado and a tropical storm is drowning Florida and Alabama.

More than 250 homes have been incinerated in Colorado's devastating wildfires - 57 homes in one subdivision on Sunday - which is the highest loss of property in the state's history.

The High Park Fire is the 
second-largest wildfire and among the most expensive in Colorado's 
history, having scorched more than 130 square miles.

more than 3 square miles by early Sunday, prompting the evacuation of 
more than 11,000 residents and scores more tourists.

'We're
used to flooding and tornadoes, nothing like this,' said Amanda Rice,

'It was just this God-awful orange glow. It was surreal. It honestly looked like hell was opening up,' Mrs Rice added.

After
spotting flames, Mrs Rice and her husband took their four children and 
their pet dog from a Manitou Springs hotel to the evacuation centre late on 
Saturday.

planning whitewater rafting trips or visits to the stunning red-rock

But,
instead of being upset, Mr Stein said: 'I think it's the best vacation 
ever. This is what the real world is about. There's a lot of people that
need help.

Wildfires have also been reported in Utah, California, New Mexico, Montana and Arizona.

Florida and Alabama remain under a 
tropical storm alert as Debby continues to bring torrential rain and 
high winds to the Gulf of Mexico.

There
are fears the slow-moving tropical storm - which has unleashed 
tornadoes killing one and ripping apart homes - could become a hurricane
as it batters Florida with rain and kicks up rough surf off the coast 
of Alabama.

Describing the 
storm as 'unpredictable', forecasters discontinued a warning for 
Louisiana, saying it was was unlikely to move west, but said they 
expected it to move northwards as the week progresses.

The storm is moving
slowly, allowing its clouds more time to unload rain. A public advisory
said parts of northern Florida could receive 10 to 15 inches of rain, 
with some areas getting as much as 25.

The
Highlands County Sheriff's Office said in a news release that several 
tornadoes moved through the area southeast of Tampa, damaging homes.

Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Nell Hays 
said a woman was found dead in a house in Venus that was destroyed in 
the storm.

A child found in the same house was taken to the hospital. No
further information was available on the child's condition or either 
person's age.

Residents in several 
counties near the crook of Florida's elbow were urged to leave low-lying
neighborhoods because of the threat of flooding.

Authorities
urged residents to leave low-lying neighborhoods in Franklin, Taylor 
and Wakulla counties because of flooding. Shelters were open in the 
area.

Debby already 
has dumped heavy rain on parts of Florida and spawned some isolated 
tornadoes, causing damage to homes and knocking down power lines.

High
winds forced the closure of an interstate bridge that spans Tampa Bay 
and links St. Petersburg with areas to the southeast.

Debby
was essentially stationary about 115 miles (185 km) south-southwest of 
Apalachicola, Fla., on Sunday evening. While storm tracks are difficult 
to discern days in advance, a forecast map predicted that the storm 
would meander north as the week unfolds.

Debby's top sustained winds were at about 60 mph (95 kph).
