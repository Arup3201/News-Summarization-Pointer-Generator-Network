The father of the schoolgirl abducted by Jeremy Forrest has said that he approves of their plan to marry and that he would happily walk his 16-year-old down the aisle.

As the teenager publicly declared her love for her jailed former teacher, her biological father said he supports their relationship and even wants to thank Forrest for what he did.

His comments come on the same day that Forrest’s sister revealed that he had told the family that he intends to marry his victim when he is released from prison.

Jeremy Forrest is to serve five and a half years after being found guilty of abduction and five counts of having sex with a child.

Today it has been revealed that the maths tutor told his parents during a prison visit: ‘I love her and we want to get married,’ and that his victim is planning on visiting him in jail.

Despite his confession of having under-age sex with his daughter – and running away with her to France when she was 15 years old - the victim’s father said he wants to shake Forrest’s hand.

‘I’d like to visit him in prison and, shake his hand, and say, “Thanks for looking after my daughter”,’ he told The Sun.

Describing his daughter’s upbringing as 
unsettled, the 41-year-old lorry driver said the pair have his blessing 
should their relationship continue after Forrest’s prison sentence.

’It would be a dream for her to settle down and marry the man she loves,’ he said adding that he would be ‘proud’ to walk her down the aisle.

The victim’s father would not condemn 
Forrest saying that although he wishes the couple would have waited 
until his daughter was 16 to have a physical relationship, he never 
feared for her safety.

He added: ‘People get suspended sentences for worse crimes.

‘Hopefully with good behaviour he may be freed on parole in a few years.’

Meanwhile, Forrest’s sister revealed the couple’s plans to meet up with him behind bars.

‘The girl’s been told that she can visit him,’ Carrie Hanspaul, 33, said.

'She’s planning on doing that as soon as she can. Jeremy told me that he’d been told that she wanted to visit.

‘In court on the day of his conviction, he said to me, ‘‘Tell her she’s allowed to visit,’’ and when I did she just smiled.’

The victim is currently living with her stepfather after her relationship with her mother deteriorated.

In a witness statement during court proceedings the teenager’s mother said her relationship with the girl would ‘never be the same again’.

She added: ‘I feel like the daughter I know has died and I’m grieving for her.’
