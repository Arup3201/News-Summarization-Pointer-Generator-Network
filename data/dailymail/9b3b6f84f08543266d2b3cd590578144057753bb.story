Chelsea took to Instagram on Saturday to back up their manager and attack the pundits who criticised their behaviour during the Champions League exit at the hands of PSG in midweek.

Graeme Souness and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher branded Jose Mourinho's team 'a disgrace' after they surrounded the referee to get Zlatan Ibrahimovic sent off during the 2-2 draw.

But afterwards, Mourinho accused the pair of having short memories, pointing out both men's own on-field reputations.

Jose Mourinho spikily replied to comments made by Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness

And the club have put their weight behind his claims, publishing pictures of both Carragher and Souness confronting officials from years gone by.

The post was captioned with the message 'For those with short memories...', and shows Carragher with his Liverpool team-mates protesting a decision in 2007, and Souness as Benfica manager in the late 1990s.

Earlier this week Mourinho had hit out at both Souness and Carragher after the defeat to PSG on away goals.

‘When Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness speak, it’s because they are having a problem for sure,' Mourinho said. 'Jamie stopped playing a couple of years ago and, in two years, he forgets everything he did on the pitch. Mr Souness also, but he stopped playing a long time ago.

‘I coached Benfica, I know a lot about him, so much about him. But I’m a certain kind of education, not just in football but in life, and I prefer to laugh.’ 

Carragher responded to the post on twitter, writing: 'I'm contesting a shocking penalty decision against Chelsea which the ref apologised for & Souey is backing his players like Jose does!!'
