Frank de Boer has designs on taking the Newcastle United job, should the club come calling in the summer.

The former Holland international, now manager at Ajax, claims his options are open – but did reveal he wouldn’t be leaving the Eredivisie side mid-season.

De Boer is making a name for himself in coaching circles and, when asked if a move to the north east appealed, the 44-year-old did nothing to suggest he wasn’t interested.

‘I have everything open,’ he said.

‘But I will be ready that’s for sure. I only said if they asked I don’t go now because I am with Ajax and I don’t want to go halfway through a season while also stepping into a team that are already halfway too.

‘So, for me, if there will be a chance it is always in the new season.’

The search for Alan Pardew’s successor at St James’ Park has stretched into a third week, with caretaker John Carver urging Mike Ashley to make a swift appointment – although managing director Lee Charnley has said they could wait until the end of the season.

Carver has yet to win a game in charge – picking up a solitary point against Burnley on New Years’s Day.

De Boer also confirmed that he was sounded out for the vacant positions at both Liverpool and Tottenham.

‘Two years ago, I was very honoured that Liverpool asked me if I was interested in the job,’ he told Sky Sports.

’There  still were other candidates also. But I just signed a new contract and I said you are too early at this moment.

‘Tottenham, last year, I was one of the candidates and in the end they chose Pochettino and all respect to the choice. There were two clubs that I was quite interested in.

‘I would like to manage in England but also Germany and the Spanish league because they are the three best leagues in the world, so I would like to get that experience.’
