British police were said to have spent several weeks tracking the movements of Saad Al-Hilli at the start of the last Gulf War

Stationed on a driveway just yards from their target's £1million home, British police were said to have spent several weeks tracking the movements of Saad Al-Hilli at the start of the last Gulf War.

Officers thought to be from Special Branch maintained constant surveillance on the aeronautical engineer and his family, regularly following Mr Al-Hilli – who fled Iraq as a boy – and his brother whenever they drove off.

Last night Philip Murphy, a neighbour in the wealthy village of Claygate, Surrey, recalled how police asked if they could use his driveway to spy on the massacre victims' mock-Tudor house.

The retired finance director said: 'I watched them from the window and they were watching Mr Al-Hilli and his brother.

'I thought they were from Special Branch. They would sit there all day in their parked car just looking at the house.

'When
 Mr Al-Hilli came out and drove off, they would follow him. It was all 
very odd. I never told the family they were being watched.'

The surveillance happened as the invasion of Iraq by US and British forces began in March 2003.

Any operation on the family would almost certainly have been backed up by bugging devices within their detached home.

Last
 night it remained unclear why a surveillance team would be sent to 
watch a man who, on the outside at least, was a respected engineer.

The home of murdered aeronautical engineer Saad Al Hilli, in Claygate, Surrey, was under police guard yesterday

Mr Al-Hilli, 50, a keen cyclist and 
badminton player, worked on a freelance basis for a satellite and 
aerospace technology company in Guildford.

He
 also owned a computer design company called SHTECH Ltd, which was 
formed in 2001, and was the company secretary for a Wiltshire-based 
aerial photography company in Swindon.

The dead man's apparent family links to Saddam Hussein's ruling Ba'ath party in Iraq may be of significance.

A
 close friend told how Mr Al-Hilli's father Kadhim, a former factory 
owner, and mother Fasiha fled Baghdad in the late 1970s. The friend told
 how Mr Al-Hilli's father had fallen out with the Ba'ath party and was 
forced to flee the country.

It
 was during this time that Saddam Hussein became powerful in Iraq before
 becoming its leader in 1979. Mr Al-Hilli came to Britain as a teenager 
and was educated at Pimlico comprehensive school in central London where
 he took O- and A-levels, specialising in maths, physics and technical 
drawing.

He later took a degree in mechanical engineering and a computer qualification. His CV reveals that he was comfortable with using several software packages and had a string of jobs in the engineering field for the past 20 years. He became a British citizen in 2002.

Yesterday Jack Saltman, another neighbour, said Mr Al-Hilli had told how he was grappling with a 'personal problem' on August 29, the day the family left for France.

'He told me something about a problem he had,' Mr Saltman said. 'I told the police that I knew what this problem was but I still haven't been able to speak to them about it.

'I've known about it for several 
months now. I knew he had family in Iraq. He did say he was worried 
about their safety. He came around to see me the night before he went 
and asked me to keep an eye on the house. He wasn't particularly 
stressed. He was looking forward to taking the kids to France again.'

Mr Saltman declined to reveal the nature of the 'personal problem'.

Other neighbours in Claygate described Mr Al-Hilli as a devoted family man who 'had no enemies'.

George
 Aicolina said: 'This doesn't add up. He's no Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.
 I very much doubt the Establishment would want to get rid of him.

surveillance team would be sent to watch a man who, on the outside at 
least, was a respected engineer

'Every time I had a problem, I would go to him. He was a very clued-up person and a precise man.'

Mr Al-Hilli met his future wife Ikbal ten years ago while on holiday in Dubai.

The couple married a year later in Surrey. Mrs Al-Hilli, an Iraqi who trained as a dentist in Sweden, then moved into her husband's home in Claygate. There were just six people at their register office wedding in Weybridge and Mr Al-Hilli once wrote on the Friends Reunited website: 'I am very happily married with a seven-month-old daughter that has me wrapped around her little finger already.'

He recently sold his beloved Suzuki Bandit motorbike, writing ruefully in the for sale advert: 'Unfortunately it has to go as it is hardly used now with kids on the scene.'

Zainab was born in 2005 and attends nearby Claygate Primary School. Her younger sister Zeena was due to start in the 'reception year' of the same school next week.

The family loved travelling across Europe in their caravan and were understood to own a property in the Dordogne region of south-west France.

On this occasion, Mr Al-Hilli told neighbours how the family were going on a spur-of-the-moment two-week holiday to 'get some sunshine and cure his sore back'.

Mr Aicolina said: 'He met his wife in Dubai. He went there on holiday and he met her there. It was a great love affair. She was Iraqi by origin but her parents live in Sweden. She was practising dentistry in the Middle East and they met by chance I think.

'They were very, very close and loved the girls very much – a happy loving family, very caring.

'He was a nice neighbour. Bad things always happen to the wrong people.'

Julian Stedman, 67, who was Mr Al-Hilli's accountant, insisted his client was 'straight up'.

'I have been to the house quite a few times and had tea there, Middle Eastern style,' he said.

'I have known Saad, his wife Ikbal and his father as well. Saad and I had talks possibly once a week and longer ones once every month.

'Saad is very much a family man. He was very much in love with his wife and his daughters. He adores them. He is a very kind and gentle person.

'I have had a tremendous shock. He never talked about what he did in Iraq.

'I never thought something of this kind would happen to him and his family. I am very saddened – especially for the little girls who have been left behind.

'He was a straight-up guy. There was never any suggestion that he might be up to no good. His accounts were perfect.'

Neighbour Lorna Davey added: 'It's shocking. I can't believe it. They were just like everybody else – very friendly and with two sweet little girls. The family was very westernised. There was no hint of an accent.'
