A guest on BBC radio made an 'outrageous' joke live on air suggesting there should be a referendum to decide whether the Queen should be beheaded.

The shocking comment was made by comedian Andy Zaltzman  during the Christian O'Connell Manifesto show on Radio 5 Live.

The remark, played out live at 10am on Saturday, came after the high-profile beheadings of three hostages by ISIS militants and prompted a number of complaints to the broadcaster. 

A video showing the beheading of Scottish aid worker David Haines - the third western and the first Briton to be beheaded by the extremists - was released on September 14.

The first victim, US journalist James Foley, was murdered in a video released on 19 August.

Weeks later, a video showing the beheading of Steven Sotloff was also released by the Jihadist group. Another Briton, journalist John Cantlie, is still being held hostage by the militants.

Zaltzman - described at the start of the show as a 'super satirist' - was one of three guests who were invited on the show to discuss the independence vote in Scotland. 

The debate, which also included presenter Dougie Anderson and comedian Lucy Beaumont, involved Mr O'Connell - who also presents a show on Absolute Radio - asking the guests what else there could be referendums about.

Zaltzman suggested a vote on whether the Queen should be beheaded. The excerpt has been removed from the repeat of the show on BBC's iPlayer.

Listener Becky Robbins, from London, said: 'It was a completely outrageous thing to say, it really is shocking.

'It not only shows a complete lack of respect for the Queen but jokes about beheadings are also insensitive and totally inappropriate. The timing could not be worse.

'This was a live broadcast on a Saturday morning. The BBC really needs to look at itself and take much more care.'

A blurb about the show on the BBC states that the presenter and his guests 'rant, cajole, debates and discuss how to make things better, tearing up rules and inventing new ones along the way'.

The comment was made on the Christian O'Connell Manifesto, a hour-long show presented by Mr O'Connell, pictured, at 10am on a Saturday

It adds: 'This week's Manifesto is a Scottish independence referendum special - now the results are in, how can we make Scotland better?'

After the incident, a BBC spokesman said: 'The Christian O'Connell Manifesto is a light-hearted entertainment programme.

'The comment was made by a guest - comedian Andy Zaltzman - and we have received five complaints.'
