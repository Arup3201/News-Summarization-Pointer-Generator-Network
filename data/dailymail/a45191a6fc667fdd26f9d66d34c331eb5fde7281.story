Incredibly loyal:  Lefty the pit bull saved her owner's life when she launched herself at a gun fired by an intruder

A pet dog has lost its leg but saved its owner's life after leaping in front of a gun fired by an armed intruder.

'Lefty' the pit bull interrupted four men who had broken into a family home, in Accomack County, Virginia, U.S., where the parents and children were sleeping.

One of the robbers pointed a firearm at the father but the small but fearless pet launched herself at it.

Putting herself between the muzzle of the gun and the owner, Lefty took a direct hit.

The shot shattered her right shoulder and blew away the muscle on her leg.

Bleeding heavily and in shock, Lefty was rushed to the nearby veterinary centre.

Surgeons got to work almost immediately, but were unable to save her leg, so they decided to amputate.

While Lefty had saved her family's 
life, they were now left unable to pay the bill for her operation and so
 the vets posted a plea for help on their Facebook page.

Alongside a picture of the adorable pet dog they explained her remarkable story.

'The outpouring of compassion and support for this sweet girl has been outstanding,' the veterinary centre said on its Facebook page

Within a matter of days, Facebook friends of the Atlantic Animal Hospital, Accomack, had donated enough funds to help cover the costs.

And today, Lefty is adapting well to her new life as a three-legged dog.

The
 practice posts regular updates on her progress including a video of her
 only a day after the procedure, getting to grips with her new way of 
walking.

The remarkable story of Lefty saving her owners' lives has received so much support and attention that the practice posts regular updates on her condition

A recent update says: 'Lefty is doing amazingly well! The outpouring of compassion and support for this sweet girl has been outstanding.'

It goes on to say: 'Today she is trotting around like she's been a 3-legged dog her entire life! She is eating very well, is in great spirits and will be heading home in the very near future.'

'I saved my family member’s lives on Monday night and now I need your help!!

Before the op: A photo of brae Lefty shortly before surgeons had to remove her front right leg, was used to plea for help to find the procedure

'In the middle of the night, 4 intruders entered my family home while my parents and the children were sleeping. They tried to shoot at my Dad - but I jumped in the way and the shotgun blast hit me instead.'

This is Lefty’s scary story – and it really happened right here on the Shore. She arrived at Atlantic Animal Hospital in shock and bleeding from a huge wound in her shoulder which tore up her muscles and shattered her humerus bone. She is doing very well after emergency treatment but since her family was robbed, they have no way to pay for all of her care, including the surgery she needs on her shoulder.

If you can help her and her family pay for some of her surgery expenses, they would be so grateful. They want to get her home as soon as possible because the children are very afraid without her. If you can help in any way, please contact Atlantic Animal Hospital to make a donation to the Lefty fund.
