Stunned police found 70 guns and a Second World War hand grenade when they made a routine search of a dead man's house.

Officers were tipped off by a relative who was clearing out the semi-detached bungalow in Brighton, East Sussex, after 72-year-old owner Barrie Hollington passed away.

Thinking they would find 'two or three' weapons, police were astonished to discover 30 rifles and 40 handguns - many of which were live and loaded.

Haul: Thinking they would find 'two or three' weapons, police in Brighton were astonished to discover 30 rifles, 40 handguns and a Second World War grenade in a routine search of a dead man's house in suburban Brighton

Overgrown: Police visited this suburban house in Brighton after its owner died, where they found the weapons

A bomb disposal team was called to the overgrown empty home, which is in a leafy street on the outskirts of Brighton lined with semi-detached bungalows.

The weapons they found included Second World War Sten gun, a Dirty Harry-style Magnum revolver, rusty bayonets and even a belt-fed automatic machine gun.

They made sure the grenade was safe before officers removed the weapons for further investigation.

Mr Hollington was believed to have lived in the £220,000 bungalow with his brother Robert Hollington, and neighbours said the house also contained a book collection.

Neighbour Alicia Taylor, said: 'I didn't know there were weapons there until someone told me.

'He was a bit of a loner and an oddball. He never did anyone any harm though.

'He was taken into care about a month or so ago.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'Who would have thought it, hey? Barrie seemed alright. He was an eccentric but never violent at all.

'It's a nice community round here, the sort of last place you would expect to find one gun, let alone 70.'

Clutter: A view through one of the windows of the house, whose owner was described as an avid collector

Mystery: Sussex Police have not revealed any more details about the man, including his age or cause of death

The weapons have now been catalogued 
at police headquarters with a green tag attached to each of the guns, 
which vary massively in shape, size and heritage.

A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'They were reported to us by a relative who was clearing out the house after the man died.'

Sergeant Chris Lane added: 'Let’s say it was not our usual day at the office.

'We were told we might found two or three firearms at the house but were amazed to find 70.

'The late owner of them who lived at the house was obviously an avid gun collector.

'The firearms have been removed and secured by officers and enquiries will be made into their origins.'

Police are now trying to establish where the guns came from.

Leafy: Police were called to this street on the outskirts of Brighton, lined with semi-detached bungalows

 Police have not revealed whether Mr Hollington had a gun licence, but one of Britain's leading firearms experts said at least some of the collection was probably legal.

David
 Dyson, who is regularly used as a gun expert in court, said: 'As a principle and looking at the number of 
weapons, I would think that many of the guns would have been collected 
legally.

'There are a number of weapons from many different decades, but the majority look to be from the Second World War. It would be very difficult for someone to amass a collection of guns that size totally illegally.

'It's very hard to price weapons without handling them, but that collection would be worth thousands of pounds, or maybe more.

'If one of the revolvers is an antique, that could be worth a thousand pounds on its own.'
