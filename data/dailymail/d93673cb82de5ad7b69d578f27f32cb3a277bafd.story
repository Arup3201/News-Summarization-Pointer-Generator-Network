TV baking competitions have got us all giving cake making a go, but some passionate pâtissiers really do go the extra mile.

In fact, one couple from south west London have turned their enthusiasm into a business. 

The Tattooed Bakers have only been going a year but its latest creation, a giant cake of Angelina Jolie's wicked character from new Disney film Maleficent, has caused ripples of excitement through the baking world.

Blood and gore: The red velvet cake was intentionally morbid

Eddie Lebeau, 26 and Richard Amon, 33, created the dish as a private commission for a Disney fan - and Eddie says the blood-coloured red velvet was intentionally gory.

The cake got plenty of attention from the world of showbusiness with TV chef Gizzi Erskine posting it on Instagram, and many others following suit.

It's a busy and exciting time for the couple, who have a 15-month-old baby daughter named Ophelia.

Richard, who owns a nightclub in Wimbledon, and Eddie, who used to work in retail management, have only been in the baking business for two years.

They both have artistic backgrounds - Rich studied art and Eddie's father is a chef.

'I learned how to bake from him,' she tells us.

The name Tattooed Bakers set the couple apart from other bakers. Also, they are both quite tattooed!

TV chef Gizzi Erskine posted about her admiration for the cake on Instagram, and many others followed suit

'We started
 baking in a weird way... we launched a company called Cake Doggy Dog in 
2012 (cakedoggydog.com) creating bespoke cakes of your dog.

'Baking
 and cake artistry is continuously growing in popularity so we wanted to
 break into the cake world with something a bit different - hence the 
dog cakes.

'But we found that they were too niche, so we started Tattooed 
Bakers in April 2013. It meant there would be no restrictions to the kind of 
cakes we'd be commissioned to do.

'We
 chose the name Tattooed Bakers to set us apart from other bakers and to
 break the stereotype of who typical cake bakers are and what can be 
created in cake.  Also, we are both quite tattooed!'

For larger scale cakes like the rainbow layer Unicorn cake the Bakers start with a scale drawing and then create a structure for the cake to be built on

'When we make the cakes, I do all the baking then we sculpt a rough shape out of the sponge, Rich does most of the sculpting in sugarpaste and I paint them,' Eddie explains.

'For large-scale cakes like the Unicorn (5ft 'life-size' rainbow cake-filled shape) and Hell Horse we start with a scale drawing and then create a structure the cake to be built on.'

The cake created for Mick Jagger's 70th Birthday

The couple have plenty to boast about, with countless commissions from the A-list, TV appearances and press coverage.

'We've made a cake for Mick Jagger's 70th Birthday, a cake of an elbow for Guy Garvey (from the band Elbow) for The Jonathan Ross Show, we made a cake for Alex Jones that was shown on BBC Sport Relief this year, we've made dogs for The Only Way Is Essex.

'We've just finished something that is top secret but will be aired in June, and we are currently working on something for BBC Three that we can't talk about!

'We recently make a cake version of Marc Quinn's Self that featured in Time Out.'
