Dogan Ismail, 17, pictured, died outside a block of flats on the Aylesbury Estate, in Walworth, south east London

Detectives wantl to trace a 15-year-old boy in connection with the murder of a teenager who was stabbed to death in the street.

Sixth form student Dogan Ismail, 17, bled to death in front of his older brother after he was stabbed following 'an altercation' outside a block of flats on the Aylesbury Estate, in Walworth, south east London, yesterday.

Police have now taken the unusual step of naming a youth wanted for questioning in connection with Mr Ismail's death.

Dawda Jallow, 15, from the Peckham area, is described as black, clean shaven with cropped black afro hair, 5ft 5in tall and of slight build.

He has brown eyes and speaks with a London accent, although he is a Gambian national.

Detective Chief Inspector Matt Bonner of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command, leading the investigation, said: 'I am seeking help from the local community to locate Dawda Jallow.

'I appeal to anyone who knows of his whereabouts, or has any information that could assist us, to come forward.

'If Dawda is seen, please do not approach him but contact police.

'I appeal direct to Dawda to present himself at a police station so this matter can be dealt with.'

Dogan was attacked after he and his brother encountered a group of four males, Scotland Yard said.

The Metropolitan Police and London Ambulance Service were called to Latimer House, Beaconsfield Road, at 4.20pm, where the victim, from Peckham, south-east London, was subsequently pronounced dead.

A post-mortem examination was taking place at Greenwich Mortuary.

Mr Bonner added: 'My thoughts go out to Dogan's family, who have been left devastated by his senseless killing.

Flowers from the murder of Shaun Chambers, 21, which took place in September are still visible next to the more recent crime scene, which police have said is not related

'That it should happen at this time of year is all the more tragic. I would like to urge anyone with information about this incident to come forward and speak with my officers or, if they would prefer to remain anonymous, Crimestoppers.'

The murder scene is yards from where 21-year-old Shaun Chambers died on September 26 after being stabbed in an apparent gang-related killing.

Mr Chambers, 21, from Greenwich, was stabbed in the heart.

However Mr Bonner said there was 'no evidence' to suggest Dogan's death was gang related.

He said: 'I know there will also be local speculation about the fact that this murder took place on the same spot that Shaun Chambers was killed on 26 September, but I would like to make clear that there is no link between the incidents aside from the location.'

Dogan is the eighth teenager to be murdered in London in 2012.

Neighbours in the area have said they are living in fear following the second incident in a matter of months

A 16-year-old girl who lives near the scene said: 'I heard someone was trying to take his mobile phone and he ran up the stairs and that's when he was stabbed.

'His older brother who is about 20 was with him and saw it happen. I came outside and could see he had been stabbed in the chest.

'His brother was on the phone to his mum, just screaming what had happened. I don't think she believed him at first. He was saying "mum, Dogan's been stabbed".'

Dogan, who is believed to have studied at the Walworth Academy, is of Turkish origin and lived in nearby Peckham.

And residents on the estate today said they were living in fear following the second such incident on their doorstep in the space of a few months.

A mum-of-two, who did not want to be identified, said: 'This is a very bad estate. It's so dangerous. I want to move, but I have to wait for the council to move me because I am poor.'

A forensic tent was still up at the scene and the stairwell remained cordoned off on one side as police stood guard at the scene.

Two people have been arrested in connection with Dogan's death.

Another 15-year-old boy has been arrested on 
suspicion of murder and a 39-year-old woman on suspicion of perverting 
the course of justice.

Anybody with information should call the incident room on 020 8358 0200 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
