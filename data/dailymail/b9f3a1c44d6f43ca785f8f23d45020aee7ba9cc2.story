Most couples prefer to keep their marital spats behind closed doors.

But Eamonn Holmes and his wife Ruth Langsford seem curiously eager to air their dirty laundry in public.

The pair, who co-present ITV’s This Morning on Fridays, have filmed themselves arguing at home and invited YouTube viewers to judge their disputes online.

Airing their dirty laundry: This morning presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford have posted their marital disputes on YouTube

Some may view the project as a transparent bid to replace Richard and Judy as the nation’s favourite bickering TV couple.

The videos, entitled He Says, She Says, are certainly designed to provoke debate between the genders on a series of mundane domestic issues.

But some viewers will just be interested in their revealing asides and excruciating  bedroom humour.

In their three videos to date, Mr Holmes and Miss Langsford, both 52, have argued over whether men can cook, whether married couples need to have ‘date nights’ and whether ornamental cushions are pointless.

Sitting in her tidy kitchen, Miss Langsford proclaimed: ‘All the cooking that happens here is done by me. Except of course when the sun comes out, and then Eamonn suddenly decides – a man that never cooks – that he can cook a barbecue.

‘And of course he can’t cook, so eight hours later we have a few burnt sausages and a bit of raw chicken.’ Clearly riled by his wife’s attack, Mr Holmes retorted: ‘It’s me that is making the house a home. We find it difficult getting people to visit us because people don’t like you.

‘But they come because they think, “Eamonn, he’s sociable, he knows how to throw a good BBQ”. This is really about you resenting me in your territory. You don’t want me cooking or in the kitchen. It’s a control thing.’

So far, the videos have gathered a total of 29 comments from viewers siding with one or the other. At times, the clips revel in excruciating innuendo best left in the bedroom.

Making no effort to spare the blushes of her online audience, Miss Langsford snapped a pair of barbecue tongs at her husband, and said: ‘Don’t let me come after you for your sausage.’ Discussing date nights, Mr Holmes complained she never makes time for romance.

The pair, who have a son Jack, ten, married in 2010 after 12 years together and live in Surrey. Miss Langsford said: ‘When you have kids you can’t be that spontaneous any more, sadly’, prompting her husband’s reply: ‘Your loss. Think of what you’re missing. Think of what it could lead to.’

Mr Holmes was also scornful about his wife’s habit of buying ornamental silk cushions for their bed. She complained he scrunches them up during his daytime naps. In a revealing aside, he said: ‘If I was beside you in bed I would like to scrunch you…You’re not too keen on that either.’

Talking point: The videos are designed to spark debate on everyday household issues between couples
