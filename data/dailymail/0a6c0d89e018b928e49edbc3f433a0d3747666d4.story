The parents of a missing teenager whose abandoned car was found four days ago say he could have been inspired to run away after watching the film 'Into the Wild'.

Johnathan Croom, 18, left a friend's home in Seattle on August 16 and was driving home to Arizona, but he failed to turn up to his first classes at Mesa Community College last Monday.

His abandoned SUV was found in Riddle, southwest Oregon close to Interstate 5 on Wednesday.

His family said they are worried that he was inspired by the film, which is based on the real-life experiences of graduate Christopher McCandless as he lived alone in the Alaskan wilderness.

Missing: Jonathan Croom vanished as he drove from Seattle to Arizona earlier this month. His abandoned car was found in southwest Oregon and his family fears he may have been inspired by 'Into the Wild'

McCandless headed to the wild with no money and few provisions in a bid to live simply and appreciate nature. He was found dead in August 1992, when he was just 24.

Croom's father David said the teenager had hinted that he was attracted to the same adventure.

'He was talking to another friend that it
would be great to just leave penniless and just work along the way and 
get resources like they did in the movie,' he told MyFoxPhoenix.com.

A friend told the family that their son might have planned the trip.

Copycat? The film, which stars Emile Hirsh, chars the experiences of a college graduate seeking adventure and a simpler life. He travels across the U.S. with few provisions and without contacting his family

'She said "he had left to go on an adventure and I haven't been able to get ahold of him for two days",' Mr Croom said.

'As far as we know he left in shorts 
and a T-shirt and a backpack with some socks in it and he left the car 
and that's all we know.'

His mother Monica added that her son 
is 'super smart' and has Boy Scout experience.

She added that his SUV didn't 
break down, wasn't out of gas and was unlocked with money inside. Officers added that the vehicle had not been broken into.

Search teams have scoured the area for clues to his whereabouts but have turned up nothing.

Johnathan was traveling alone on his 
way back from Seattle where he had visited a female friend but failed to
return home. He had originally left Arizona on July 30.

On his blog earlier this year, he described himself as someone looking for excitement and adventure.

'I am definitely searching for my purpose in the world and writing about Life,' he wrote. 'I want to teach people to live 
extraordinarily unusual, fun, exhilarating lives. In order to do so, I 
need to be living the excitement myself.'

But he added in a post written in May: 'I do recognize that I make very bad decisions, quite often.

'These
decisions lead to a lot of remorse and unhappiness. I know I should 
just let these things go and push forward, as I’d recommend to anybody, 
but it’s hard.

Vanished: On his blog, Croom said he wanted to live an exciting life so he could teach others how to do so

'I am trying though. I truly am... I will look back and see how far I’ve come and I will know that anything is possible.'

Mr Croom is in now in Oregon putting up missing posters in the hope someone will recognize his son.

'I'm just trying to stay busy and proactive and asking a lot of people to pray - that's my way of coping,' he said.

Johnathan Croom is 6-foot-1 and weighs 140 pounds and might be carrying a multi-colored backpack, his mother said. Anyone who thinks they might have spotted Croom is asked to contact the Douglas County (Ore.) Sheriff's Office at 541-440-4471.
