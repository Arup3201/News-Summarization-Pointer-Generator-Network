A nasal cancer patient has found a novel way of ensuring he does not misplace his prosthetic nose - by sticking it to the side of his fridge.

Bert Eastham's nose was removed three years ago when it was found to contain cancerous cells.

Last month the 64-year-old was fitted with a prosthetic nose - it is held on to his face using magnets.

Novel storage: The prosthetic nose has magnets that attach to magnetic studs implanted in Mr Eastham's face - this also means it easily sticks to the fridge in his kitchen

Mr Eastham, from Chorley, Lancashire said: 'My new nose has given me a new lease of life but I was so worried we would lose it.'

But after repeatedly buying fridge magnets as souvenirs from his holidays, Mr Eastham came up with a brainwave and now sticks his prosthetic nose alongside the others on the side of the fridge freezer before he goes to bed.

'I used to wear my nose to bed when I first got it, but one night it fell off and landed in one of my slippers, when I got up in the middle of the night, I stood on my own nose. I got the shock of my life.

'It was only when I noticed the fridge magnets in our kitchen that I thought I would test out whether my new nose would stick to the side too.

'Now if I’m cooking dinner, sometimes I’ll just stick my nose on the fridge next to the magnets because I don’t know when my nose is running and I wouldn’t want anything going into the food.

'Or if I’m at a party with my 
friends, I’ll maybe stick it on the fridge just to lighten things up. I 
can’t wait for the next time we go on holiday and go through security 
because I’ll have to take my nose off - I bet they won’t have seen that 
before.'

Mr Eastham was diagnosed with nasal cancer in 2009, after noticing growths on his face.

He
said: 'For a year I had two scabs at the entry of each nostril, which I
assumed were cold sores. I just used to pick them off - I didn’t think 
it was anything serious.'

The
sores were swabbed and Bert was prescribed antibiotics but in February 
2009, he was transferred to Preston Royal Hospital for a biopsy where he
was diagnosed with cancer.

Mr Eastham, who
lives with his wife Olwyn, 62, an accounts manager said: 'I felt like I
was in a dream, you always know someone with cancer but you never think
you’ll be the one to get it.

'It was such a blow - I had been made redundant the month before, so it was already a difficult time.'

Mr Eastham,
who has seven grandchildren, was told the operation would be the most 
effective treatment so he agreed to go for it - even though his face 
would never be the same.

Result: 'I burst into tears when I saw it for the first time - it looked so real', said Mr Eastham

He
said: 'I was told it would leave me very disfigured but would be the 
best option to fight the disease. It was life or death - so I didn’t 
care about losing my nose.

'I
wanted to carry on living and see my grandchildren grow up, that’s what
was important to me. I must have sat in the car outside the house for 
40 minutes thinking of ways to break the news to my wife.

'She
burst into tears - she wasn’t expecting it. She phoned our family who 
came round, it was very emotional. They were all so positive and told me
they were behind me.'

Mr Eastham underwent the operation to remove his nose and most of his upper lip on April 16, 2009, before receiving four weeks of radiotherapy in June.

He said: 'It was all very quick - I was home the next day. I was looked after by a fantastic team of nurses who would come to change the dressing - I can’t praise them enough.

'The dressing was removed every day until it healed - but I just couldn’t force myself to look at it.'

Although Mr Eastham had the confidence to go out with friends and to the shops within two weeks of his operation, it took him six months to look at himself in a mirror.

He said: 'I refused to look. I thought I looked so ugly the first time I did, my stomach dropped. The vain man in me would have likened me to Paul McCartney - my hero - but I just looked so different.'

'I went back for the prognosis, it was the first time I’d seen the surgeon smile.

He said it was good news and that I had the all clear. It was such a big relief, I just felt brilliant', he added.

Up until four weeks ago Mr Eastham wore a triangular-shaped plaster on his face in a bid to improve his appearance - but he added: 'Teenagers would actually shout abuse across the street, they would be laughing and pointing at me.

'Adults would avoid me - when they saw me they’d hurry their kids across the road. Some people thought I’d been in a terrible fight and had brought it on myself. I felt ignored and was sick of people patronising me.

'But it didn’t stop me going out, my amazing wife helped me and told me I was better than them - I wouldn’t let them stop me getting on with his life.'

Surgeons operated to improve the appearance of Bert’s top lip last September and he was finally fitted with a silicon nose produced by Oral Maxillofacial Surgery UK last month.

Technicians at the firm spent months designing and producing the prosthetic nose, which was a rare task for them, as they were used to creating eyes, nipples and ears.

'They looked at photos to create an exact replica of my nose and matched my skin colour perfectly. It is so life-like, the detail is incredible - there are even varicose veins.'

Mr Eastham had waited more than three years for his new nose, which is held on with magnets.

'I burst into tears when I saw it for the first time - it looked so real', he said.

Within the last months, his self-confidence has shot up and he is delighted.

'When I walked out of the hospital with my new nose, not one person looked at me. I felt normal again. Although I’ll never look the same, I am so pleased I can get on with my life', he said.
