David Cameron yesterday backed a college’s controversial decision to ban pupils wearing the full facial veil for security reasons.

All students, staff and visitors to Birmingham Metropolitan College were told they must have their faces visible at all times so they are ‘easily identifiable’.

But the move has been criticised by some students, one describing the policy as disgusting.

Today a protest organised on Facebook – supported by the local Labour MP – is being held at the campus in central Birmingham.

Split: David Cameron backed schools and colleges to enforce uniform rules but Nick Clegg said he felt 'uneasy' about telling people what they should wear

More than 800 people claimed they planned to attend to stand up to what they said was an ‘Islamophobic’ decision.

Mr Cameron’s spokesman said the Prime 
Minister defended the right of educational institutions to be able to 
‘set and enforce their own school uniform policies’.

But Deputy Prime
Minister Nick Clegg said he felt ‘uneasy’ about a veil ban in a 
schools, although he could understand why it was needed to identify 
people at airport checkouts.

The college which has 44,000 students 
and is the third largest in the UK, say headwear poses a security risk 
and their policy ‘includes the removal of hoodies, hats, caps and veils 
so that faces are visible’.

This would stop female Muslim pupils from
wearing the niqab, the full facial veil where only the woman’s eyes are
visible, or the burqa where the eye area is covered in mesh.

Outrage: Imaani Ali, 17, believes the ban on veils is a breach of her freedom - this veil is not allowed because it covers all, but Imaani's eyes

Student
Imaani Ali, 17, who studies applied sciences said: ‘We would happily 
show the men at security our faces so they could check them against our 
IDs, but they won’t let us. It’s a breach of my freedom and I feel 
discriminated against.’

Another 17-year-old student, who was not named, 
said: ‘It’s disgusting.’

The Prime Minister’s spokesman said: ‘We back schools being able to set and enforce their own school uniform policies.’

Nick
Clegg, asked about the decision on his LBC radio phone-in, told a 
caller he ‘set the bar very high to justify something like that’

He 
added: ‘I’ve always defended people’s right to wear what they want and 
that’s very much what I would apply here.’

The Education Department 
said it is up to the governing body of a school to decide whether there 
should be a school uniform or any other rules about appearance, and if 
so what they should be.

But Shabana Mahmood, the Labour MP for 
Ladywood, said she was shocked by the policy, and has written an open 
letter to the college’s principal calling for an urgent meeting.

In the 
letter to Christine Braddock CBE, she expressed ‘deep concerns’ that it 
would deter young women from her constituency from attending the 
college.

In a statement the principal said the policy, developed 
after consultation with students, ‘will mean everyone allowed on the 
premises can understand and know each other in a safe environment.’

The college provides A-level and vocational training for around 9,000 16 to 19-year-olds and 35,000 mature students.

Case by case: Schools can outlaw veils but only after a consultation

Headteachers have the power to order students to remove veils after a series of high profile legal cases.

In a key 2007 case, a High Court judge rejected a bid by a pupil to be allowed to wear the niqab in class.

Although the 12-year-old’s three older sisters had worn the headwear at the same school in Buckinghamshire, teachers said it impeded their ability to communicate with her.

They said they needed to be able to tell if a pupil was paying attention, engaged with her work or distressed.

After the case, the Government issued guidance that enabled headteachers to ban full-face veils on grounds of security, safety or learning.

It said teachers were justified in enforcing uniform rules which mean they can see and make eye contact with pupils.

Schools need to be able to identify pupils to maintain order in classrooms and to spot any intruders, it added.

But rather than a French-style blanket ban on face coverings in all public spaces, the Department of Education said institutions could outlaw the coverings as long as they carried out a proper consultation.

Updated Government guidance released last year clearly continues to back heads who choose to ban face-coverings.

It says it is ‘still lawful’ to restrict the freedom of pupils to express their religion on the grounds of ‘health, safety and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others’.

And religious freedoms do not mean pupils can practise their beliefs ‘at any time, in any place, or in any particular manner,’ the  guidance adds.
