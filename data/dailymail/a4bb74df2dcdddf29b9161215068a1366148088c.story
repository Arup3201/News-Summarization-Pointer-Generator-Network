The multimillionaire creator of an internet search engine creator has been accused of adultery by his wife in a very public Twitter shaming.

Scott Jones, 53, the man who created ChaCha, a boutique search engine backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, was accused of having an affair with a colleague.

His wife, who is known as Vee Vee Jones, accused him of having sexual relations with a fellow worker at ChaCha. 

Mr Jones, an American inventor,  is 
worth an estimated $150 million - he has already been divorced twice - once in
 1997 and again in 2004.

Yesterday
 his third wife, who he met via match.com, tweeted: 'I'm dying inside, its hard to give my newborn 
& my 5 y/o proper attention. Thanks Scott for screwing 
our family big time.'

She then posted a photo of her breastfeeding a baby reading: 'While I was doing this' to her 50,000 Twitter followers.

Gawker reported that Jones' wife is a pro poker player.

This morning she wrote: 'Had a nightmare that this whore ruined my family, then realize it's reality.'

Scott A. Jones (born in 1960) is an American inventor.

In the early 1990s Jones made about $50 million on his company, which created the predominate form of voicemail, and he 'retired' at age 31.

But he could not stay out of the game

He founded Internet-based music service company Gracenote, now utilized by Apple, Yahoo, and Sony.

Gracenote services are accessed 
globally at the rate of 24 billion times per year by applications such 
as iTunes - the company was sold to Sony in 2008 for $260 million.

In 2008 he came up with ChaCha - a 
popular mobile service that allows users to text virtually any question 
to 242-242 and receive answers within minutes.

His father told CNN he is a stickler about his good reputation.

'He doesn't like to be the bad guy," says his father, George

'If there's a problem at the house, [his chief of staff] is the bad guy.'

On her blog today Mrs Jones  wrote: ' It’s been over 24 hours since I found out the love of my life was capable of deceit. We weren’t a story book match made in heaven… But I honest to god love him with all I know. Odds were against us, and no one said we would last… They are right.

'I thought I found my forever love with him. My adult love.'

Mr Jones said the couple met  on the dating website when she was living in Miami and he was living in Indiana.

She wrote that she fell pregnant a month into their relationship and claimed that Mr Jones cheated on her when she was eight months pregnant.

She claimed she was going leave him, but Mr Jones was diagnosed with cancer so she stayed.

They got married in November 2011, but Mrs Jones claims: 'Between Thanksgiving and Christmas was when I realize he fell out of love with me…'

'But can you blame him? I gained weight (pregnant). Puking 6 times a day… Can’t go out to eat… No sex :-/ Of course he’s going to cheat.'

Mr Jones who has the handle @chachaman has not replied to any of the tweets - his last message read: 'We must become the change we want to see.' – Mahatma Gandhi.'

The couple live in a mansion on a 53-acre estate in Carmel, Indiana with their children.

According to CNN money: 'The home features a 33-foot-high great room, an indoor tree house, a circular mahogany slide connecting two floors, a 25-foot-long saltwater aquarium, two waterfalls in the master bathroom, a separate indoor basketball court, and a full-scale cast of a T. rex skull.'

Forbes wrote: 'The home is divided into 46 audio and video zones, 246 lighting circuits, and numerous security cameras and sensors. One can only gain entry into the master suite by pressing his fingerprints against a security pad. Even the boys’ tree house is wired with a T1 line (high-speed Internet access).'

When his son Andrew was sixteen years old, Mr Jones was featured on MTV's Teen Cribs - Kim Kardashian announced the home was the winner.
