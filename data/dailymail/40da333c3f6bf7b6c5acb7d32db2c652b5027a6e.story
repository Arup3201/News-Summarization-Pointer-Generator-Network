Fiorentina striker Giuseppe Rossi is set to return to Italy next month to continue his recovery from a knee ligament injury which has blighted his season.

The former Manchester United youngster's problems with his right knee began in October 2011 when he missed 18 months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament.

In January this year he strained ligaments in the same knee and suffered a recurrence of the injury in early September.

Manchester United: 14 appearances, 4 goals.

Newcastle: 13 appearances, 1 goal. 

Villarreal: 79 apperances, 38 goals.

Fiorentina: 24 appearances, 17 goals.

Italy: 34 apperances, 11 goals.

When fit, Rossi has been a revelation, scoring 16 goals in 19 Serie A starts for the Viola since joining from Villarreal in January last year.

Rossi is currently in America receiving treatment, but is set to return to Italy in the next few weeks.

'Fiorentina announce that Giuseppe Rossi has today been assessed by Professor S. Singleton in Vail (Colorado, USA),' the club said in a statement.

'The assessment revealed the meniscus suture is healing in the correct way.

'There will be a gradual increase in weight loads until the next scheduled inspection in three-four weeks.

'After this period, the athlete will return to Florence.'

Fiorentina head coach Vincenzo Montella will be delighted to hear of the progress made by his star striker
