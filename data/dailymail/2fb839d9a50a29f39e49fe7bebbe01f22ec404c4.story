Monster: Care worker Colin Stokes who has admitted raping three women in a Gloucestershire care home. He was arrested for a sexual offence in 2007 but continued to work in care after the case was dropped

A care worker who raped three vulnerable women could have been brought to justice nearly a decade ago if a sex abuse prosecution had not been dropped.

Colin Stokes, 48, attacked the victims - who all lived in supported accommodation in Gloucestershire - when he was supposedly looking after them.

The victims, aged 32, 50 and 54, all have learning disabilities, difficulties communicating and require 24-hour care. He was today jailed for 14 years.

Now it has been revealed that in April 2007 Gloucestershire Police arrested him on suspicion of inciting sexual activity with a mentally ill woman.

The alleged victim had severe communication difficulties and there was also no witnesses to support her account - meaning it was her word against Stokes, who lives in Dursley, Gloucestershire.

He was released on bail and police presented a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service but four months later lawyers decided there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction.

The case against Stokes was dropped and he continued to work in the care industry.

But Gloucestershire Police admitted it did not tell social services of the allegations made against Stokes - leaving him free to rape his victims.

Detective Chief Superintendent Bernie Kinsella, head of specialist crime operations at Gloucestershire Police, said the force had carried out a comprehensive inquiry into Stokes in 2007.

'There was a very full and thorough investigation and we liaised with the Crown Prosecution Service and gave them a file of evidence,' he said.

'They have to make an assessment and they decided there was insufficient evidence on this particular occasion to support a prosecution.'

Stokes was employed to work the night shift and help with day-to-day tasks. Due to staff cut backs he worked alone, Gloucester Crown Court heard.

In April last year a second investigation into Stokes began when one of his colleagues reported that a resident had told them they had been abused by him, the court was told.

Stokes, who had worked in the care industry for 13 years and in his current job since 2007, was immediately arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault and suspended.

Detectives used a specialist intermediary with Makaton cards (a visual language system used to communicate with people who have learning difficulties) to question residents who Stokes had been in contact with, after the first victim suggested there were others who had been abused.

Those inquiries found the second victim and forensic inquiries linked Stokes to a third vulnerable adult.

In August he was charged with three counts of rape and three of sexual assault.

Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Stokes 'These three ladies had the bodies of adults but the minds of children and little children at that.

'They were every bit as vulnerable as little children and in some ways they were more vulnerable.

'Whereas a child might later have been able to explain what had happened to them when they had reached maturity these three ladies will never be able to explain fully either what happened or how they feel.

'I have no doubt you chose them as your victims because of their respective vulnerabilities.

'You had sex with each of them. Such behaviour was cruel and depraved. None of those ladies was capable of giving consent as you well knew.

'Although they find it difficult to explain what happened there is no doubt that your behaviour has left them very disturbed and deeply upset.'

Mr Kinsella said there had been many changes to the way crimes against vulnerable adults were now investigated by the police both in Gloucestershire and nationally.

'We now have a specialist team of officers investigating offences such as this,' he said.

'But we also have much closer working with Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults, so we have a much more effective exchange of information.

'So any incident involving any potential abuse in a care home setting, we will be exchanging information about that, so we are much better placed to be able to prevent any further incidents from occurring.

'I think we are much better placed now and it is much less likely that offending such as that will be able to continue because we do have the effective warnings and information exchange between the police and Safeguarding Adults.'

Rachael Scott, head of the CPS South West rape and serious sexual offence unit, explained why Stokes had not been prosecuted in 2007.

'All offences of a sexual nature are considered serious and every effort is made to prosecute such cases subject to the Code for Crown Prosecutors being met,' she said.

'In 2007 a complainant made an allegation of a sexual assault by Colin Stokes. Stokes was interviewed and denied the offence. This was one person's word against another.

'In the absence of any corroboration the decision was made that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.'

Stokes had been subjected to an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check by his employer, which means police would have been able to disclose information about the 2007 invetigation because it was relevant to his employment.

'Police informed his employer of the allegations and it was his employer’s responsibility to inform social services,' a force spokesman told the Press Association.

Gloucestershire County Council said it did know about the allegations against Stokes and has now commissioned a serious case review.

'The county council was aware of a police investigation in 2007, but no charges were brought and the case was closed,' a spokeswoman said.

'However, we have now asked the Safeguarding Adults Board to carry out a serious case review to understand exactly what happened in the past and to check we are doing all we can to keep our vulnerable people safe.'

Stokes pleaded guilty to three counts of rape, which were all committed between January 1 2012 and April 1 2013. He denied two offences of sexual assault and they were ordered to lie on file by the judge.

Distressed parents and relatives of Stokes’ victims were in court, several in tears, as prosecutor Sarah Regan detailed Stokes’ offences.

She read statements from the mothers and sisters of the victims describing how their lives had been devastated by what Stokes did.

One mother said that her daughter had not been expected to live more than a few days after birth but had survived - only to become a victim of Stokes.

'I vowed as long as I lived that no-one would hurt her,' she stated.

'How wrong was I?'

She said her daughter went into the home in 2009 after her father had a heart attack.

On April 15 last year when she was told what Stokes had done to her daughter ‘our world fell apart,’ she stated,.

'I felt numb and shocked and physically sick. My husband had to go outside to get some air. I wanted to hold her tight but I was in such a state that she would have been upset to see me like that.

'We thought she would be safe and would never come to any harm.'

'Predator': One of the detectives who brought Colin Stokes said he has not shown a shred of remorse for his sickening actions

One of the detectives who brought Colin Stokes to justice branded him a 'sexual predator' who has not shown a shred of remorse for his sickening actions.

Detective Sergeant Mike Rich was the second-in-command during the inquiry and interviewed the perverted care worker.

'He is somebody who gave me a great deal of concern,' the officer said.

'Clearly he is a sexual predator and one of the things that struck me was that at no point did I see anything that suggested any kind of remorse for what he had done.

'I still don't think that he can understand the ramification of his actions.

'These victims already face some pretty difficult challenges in their lives and then they find themselves being abused in this callous and cruel way by a man supposedly looking after them.

'It is not just the victims who he has hurt but the families who have to live with this for the rest of their lives.

'He did deny these offences and it was quite frustrating for the investigating officers that as the evidence mounted against him, and that evidence was put to him, he maintained his position.

'I can't account for why he did that but perhaps he thought it was something he might get away with.

'I think he might have thought that because his victims were very vulnerable getting accounts from them can be quite challenging.

'But we managed to do that with the use of intermediaries to interview the victims and when he came to court in January he was left with no option but to plead guilty.'

Det Sgt Rich added: 'I wish he had done it earlier so that the victims would not have this hanging over them for so long.

'I think it was a combination of the amount of evidence that was against him.

'I'd like to say it was compassion for the victims but I still see no reaction from Colin Stokes.'

The detective, who has worked in public protection for two years, said the three victims were relieved when told Stokes would be going to prison for a long time.

'I am told at various stages some of the women have been quite disturbed by it,' he said.

'When he pleaded guilty in January officers from Operation Innisbrook went to speak to the victims and told them that 'Colin' would never be coming back and could not hurt them again.

'I am told there were lots of smiles and lots of relief.'

But their families have been left devastated at what Stokes has done to their loved ones.

'When you have vested your trust in somebody to look after your daughter, your auntie, your mum and they are exploited like this, I think it is very difficult to comprehend how they must have felt,' he said.

'The families have been very supportive of our investigation and have been very patient, very brave and very resolute.'
