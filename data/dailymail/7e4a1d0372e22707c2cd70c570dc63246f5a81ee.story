The British Army drew up secret plans to train a 100,000-strong rebel army to defeat Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

The ‘shock and awe’ strategy, drawn up by General Sir David Richards, would have seen the Syrian force march on Damascus with jets from the UK and the West providing cover.

But the plan was shelved two years ago after David Cameron and senior ministers deemed it too risky.

Under the extraordinary plan, members of the Free Syrian Army would have spent a year training in Jordan and Turkey before marching on Damascus

The extraordinary plot, revealed by BBC Newsnight, was considered on both sides of the Atlantic before it was dropped.

It would have seen 100,000 Syrians vetted and spend a year training in military combat at bases in Turkey and Jordan.

They would then have flooded Damascus in an audacious attempt to bring down the Assad regime.

The details of significant British involvement in the civil war are all the more surprising because last summer Mr Cameron lost a key vote in the Commons on even considering military action.

Lord Richards, who was made a peer after standing down as chief of the defence staff, thought the ambitious plan was needed to counter the might of forces loyal to Assad.

It reached the National Security Council in London and was also put to senior figures in Washington, the BBC reported.

General Sir David Richards, now Lord Richards, pushed the idea that the only way to end the bloody civil war in Syria was to allow President Bashar al-Assad, or take decisive action to topple him

At the time it came to nothing, but just last week US President Barack Obama announced a £300million plan to train and equip ‘moderate’ opposition forces in Syria.

Mr Cameron was left battered and bruised after MPs refused to support his plan for military intervention against the use of chemical weapons.

Parliament was recalled for an emergency session in August last year, with Downing Street anticipating cross-party support for intervention.

But in an extraordinary assault on Mr Cameron's authority, 39 coalition MPs joined Labour in voting against a watered-down Government motion supporting the only ‘principle’ of military action.

There were shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the result was announced to a shocked House of Commons.

Monzer Akbik, spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, an opposition alliance, told the BBC: 'The international community did not intervene to prevent those crimes and at the same time did not actively support the moderate elements on the ground.

'A huge opportunity was missed and that opportunity could have saved tens of thousands of lives actually and could have saved also a huge humanitarian catastrophe.'
