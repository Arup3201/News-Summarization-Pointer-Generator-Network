Joachim Low's Germany side appeared in good spirits as they trained ahead of their clash with Spain.

The match, which will be played at Celta Vigo's stadium in north-west Spain, will see the current world champions taking on their predecessors.

Neither, though, are in particularly good form. Both sides have lost two of their last five games and both are currently only second in their Euro 2016 qualifying groups.

Tuesday's meeting may only be a friendly but Loew and Vicente del Bosque will view the match as a good test of their teams, both of whom are going through transitional phases following very different World Cup performances.

While Spain's group-stage exit necessitated the reshuffle of a previously unbeatable formula, Germany's success led to the retirement of a number of influential players, including captain Philipp Lahm and Arsenal's Per Mertesacker. 

Meanwhile, Del Bosque even revealed he would be prepared to drop Chelsea duo Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas as he continues to look for the right balance. 

He said: 'As I have said, when a player who comes to us plays well, others that want to get into the team will find it more difficult.

'If I say that Diego Costa and Cesc may find it hard to play I'm not threatening any sort of revenge or reprisal against anybody, it merely reflects a truth about football that we all know. If someone doesn't play and his replacement does well, the other player has to do better to get into the team. But nobody is ruled out.'
