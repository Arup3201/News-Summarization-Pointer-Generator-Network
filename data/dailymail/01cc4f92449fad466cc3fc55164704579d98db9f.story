Besiktas are keen on Chelsea striker Demba Ba after cooling interest in Samuel Etoâ€™o.

Senegalese striker Ba has been frustrated by his lack of playing time this season, with Eto'o and Fernando Torres often picked ahead of him.

And with chelsea looking to sign Diego Costa from Atletico Madrid and Ezequiel Lavezzi from PSG, Ba's appearances next season could be even more limited.

Last-gasp: Demba Ba scored a crucial goal to put Chelsea into the Champions League semi-final

Limited: The striker celebrated that goal wildly but has been frustrated with a lack of playing time

Options: Jose Mourinho would like to hold on to Ba having already seen Samuel Eto'o leave the club

Replacements: Chelsea have had talks with Diego Costa (left) and enquired about Lavezzi's availability

However it is understood that Jose Mourinho is still keen to hold on to the forward, despite seemingly preferring his other striking options last eason.

Striker Ba netted just five times in the Premier League this season, although he did score the vital Champions League goal which saw Chelsea knock out PSG and reach the semi-finals.

Besiktas are looking to boost their striking options after finishing third in the Turkish league.
