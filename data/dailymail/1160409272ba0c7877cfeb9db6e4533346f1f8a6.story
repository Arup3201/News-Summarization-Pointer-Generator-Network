Dozens of Palestinian protesting against British policy have tried to attack a senior British diplomat while on a visit to a university today.

The hostile demonstration forced the British consul general, Sir Vincent Fean, to cancel a speech at the Birzeit University near Ramallah.

He was not hurt, although one demonstrator was seen kicking him in the shins.

Student activists said they were protesting against decades of British policy supporting Israel over Palestinians.

They said their chief grievance was over Britain's support for a Jewish homeland in what was at the time still Palestine.

In 1917, Britain published the Balfour Declaration calling for 'the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people'.

The letter also said 'nothing shall be done' that would prejudice the civil rights of non-Jews. Israel gained independence in 1948.

Britain is an ally of Israel but has been highly critical of its policies toward the Palestinians, especially settlement construction in the West Bank.

In recent days tensions have risen in the West Bank, with demonstrations, some of them violent, in solidarity with Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons. Some have predicted that the protests could escalate into a full-scale uprising.

'We asked the university to cancel his visit because Britain is the cause of the Palestinian tragedy,' said Taha Afghani, student leader of the Palestinian Fatah group, one of several political factions that organised the protest. Fatah is headed by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas.

The university's administration decided to
the cancel Sir Vincent's lecture after dozens of students, some waving 
Palestinian flags and signs, gathered outside the office.

Sir Vincent was returning to his vehicle after meeting Birzeit University officials when he was ambushed by protesters.

The Foreign Office said that Sir Vincent had hoped 'to engage in an open dialogue' about Britain's policies in the Middle East. 'Sadly, such a dialogue was not possible on this occasion.'

Birzeit University condemned the incident. 'We believe it would have been much more useful if the students had a dialogue with the guest and expressed their political views in a peaceful way,' it said.

Dozens of Palestinian students at the West Bank university heckled the British diplomat and attacked his car as he attempted to leave

The protesters held up banners reading: 'I am a refugee because of Balfour' in reference to Britain's publication in 1917 of the Balfour Declaration calling for 'the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people'
