Dundee United confirm they rejected Blackpool's approach to talk to McNamara

McNamara insists he is happy managing the Tannadice club

Blackpool are in the search for a new manager after Barry Ferguson rules himself out

Dundee Utd have kicked out an approach from Blackpool for their manager Jackie McNamara.

The English Championship strugglers only escaped relegation on the last day of the season after Barry Ferguson’s uninspiring spell in caretaker charge of the club.

The former Rangers skipper this week all but ruled himself out of the running to get the job on a permanent basis and yesterday Blackpool turned their sights on the highly-rated McNamara.

Making his point: Jackie McNamara expressed his deire to stay at Dundee United despite Blackpool's interest

United moved quickly to reject their advances and a club statement read: ‘Dundee United confirms it has denied Blackpool FC permission to speak to Manager Jackie McNamara.

‘The manager has been kept aware of the situation and declared that he is fully committed to the Club and very happy to remain at Dundee United for the foreseeable future. The Club will make no further comment on this matter.’

Insisting he is happy where he is, McNamara added: ‘While flattered at the interest shown, I am very happy at Dundee United and wish to continue the job and build upon the foundations laid down over the last 18 months or so. ‘I view the approach as a positive endorsement of all the hard work undertaken by everyone at the Club in that period and have no plans to leave.

‘All of my focus is on the forthcoming William Hill Scottish Cup final and preparations for the new season ahead.’

McNamara replaced Peter Houston at Tannadice 18 months ago after leaving Partick Thistle.

He is widely credited with developing youngsters such as Ryan Gauld, John Souttar, Stuart Armstrong and Andrew Robertson and is seen as one of the country’s most promising managerial talents.

Indeed Tannadice defender Mark Wilson expressed surprise yesterday that McNamara had failed to feature prominently on manager of the year shortlists.

Promoting Thursday’s TSB under-18s Senior Shield final at New Douglas Park between St Ambrose High School of Coatbridge and Springburn Academy, Wilson said: ‘I was surprised he wasn’t nominated for Manager of the Year. I think they name it a bit too soon. He has come in to United at a time when it was a real test for him.

‘The wage bill had been cut and he had a lot of players to shift. He gave a lot of young players their chance. Maybe other managers would have put them in for one or two games, then brought them back out, but he had the confidence to stick with them.

‘The football Jackie encourages United to play has been a breath of fresh air for Scottish football. It is fitting for him to be in the cup final this season, especially going back to Celtic Park. He truly deserves it.’

Sportsmail has learned that Armstrong and Robertson were watched once again by Everton in Tuesday’s 3-1 defeat to Aberdeen.

And Wilson fears the forthcoming final could be a United swansong for some of his young team-mates.

‘Of course it would be good for our young boys to stay at Dundee United. But it can be really difficult for clubs to knock back serious offers,’ he said.

‘As soon as a big offer comes in it’s hard for chairmen to knock it back and say they want to keep their best young players for at least another year.

‘From a chairman’s perspective, who’s to say these boys aren’t a flash in the pan, that they go off the boil and they are out of the team the following year?

‘So it’s a touchy subject.

‘It would be good for them to stay for their teams, the leagues and their education.

‘But it’s very difficult when money gets offered and contracts get put in front of young guys that are three or four times their wages. It’s hard to knock back.’
