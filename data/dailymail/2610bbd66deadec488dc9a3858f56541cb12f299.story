Projected sales of whiskey are set to surpass vodka sales for the first time this year since 2007.

That means whiskey will take the reigns as America's biggest selling liquor over gin, rum, tequila and all the rest. 

Vodka still beats the rest big time in terms of volume sold, but the more refined dark liquor will pull in more sales in dollars by year's end.

Battle of the booze: Projected sales of whiskey are set to surpass vodka sales for the first time this year since 2007

Quartz reports that the shift comes as vodka simply runs out of ways to interest consumers.

In 2013, Euromonitor analyst Jared Koerten tells Quartz, vodka growth grew by just 1 percent.

In the five years prior, that number was closer to five times that. 

After growth from the top shelf brands like Grey Goose topped out, vodka makers moved on to market flavored products. Now a seemingly unending variety from smoked salmon to cotton candy are available, but interest has slowed.

Experts also blame the 'Mad Men effect,' as popular culture has shifted toward an appreciation for more complex booze and as the trend in drinking establishments moves toward craft cocktails.

Overall, vodka is facing slower growth in the United States as consumers' liquor preferences change. Sales increased just 1.4 percent to $17.3 billion in 2013, according to market research firm Euromonitor International, marking the slowest pace since at least 2000.

That is because newer generations of drinkers are increasingly shifting toward brown liquors such as bourbon and whiskey in what analysts call the "Mad Men effect" - a reference to the Prohibition-era drinks consumed on the popular television show. According to the Distilled Spirits Council, an industry trade group, sales volumes of whiskey in 2013 were up 6 percent, outpacing vodka's 1 percent growth.

"Vodka's appeal to a lot of people has been that it doesn’t taste like anything," said Drew Dupuy, a 35-year-old communications manager in Washington, D.C. He used to drink Bloody Marys with vodka at brunch with his friends but now orders the drink with tequila or gin. "There's a wide range of liquors with interesting profiles that you can make really flavorful cocktails with."

Why the shift? Experts point toward the 'Mad Men effect,' as popular culture has shifted toward an appreciation for more complex booze and as the trend in drinking establishments moves toward craft cocktails
