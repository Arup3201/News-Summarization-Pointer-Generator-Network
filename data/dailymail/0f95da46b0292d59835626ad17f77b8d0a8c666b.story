John Bercow was forced into a humiliating climbdown last night over his bid to appoint an ‘unqualified’ Australian to run Parliament.

The Speaker announced a ‘pause’ in the recruitment of Carol Mills to the £200,000-a-year post of Commons clerk, following a barrage of criticism from MPs on all sides.

In an extraordinary public revolt, Tory MPs openly heckled Mr Bercow while he made a statement on the issue.

There were jeers and heckles from MPs in the Commons as Mr Bercow read his statement on his plans to fill the £200,000-a-year post of Commons Clerk

Then
 they queued up to question his judgment over Miss Mills, who has been 
dubbed the ‘Canberra caterer’ because her duties at the Australian 
senate include managing the kitchens.

Leading
 Tory Jesse Norman, who is heading a cross-party Commons revolt on her 
selection, said Miss Mills was ‘not qualified’ to carry out the role of 
clerk – who advises MPs, including the prime minister, on constitutional
 matters.

Miss Mills, currently head of the Department of Parliamentary 
Services in Canberra, was selected by a panel led by Mr Bercow in July.

But Downing Street has sat on the recommendation for weeks rather than 
passing it on to the Queen for approval, because of mounting concern 
among MPs.

'Canberra caterer': Carol Mills' appointment has been criticised by MPs from all parties

Carol Mills is the current Department of Parliamentary Services secretary in Canberra, Australia, a service department that supports the work of the Federal Parliament and is the principal support agency for Parliament House.

It works closely with the Department of the Senate and Department of the House of Representatives to support the operations of the Parliament and its Committees, has around 800 staff and an annual budget of around $120 million. 

She is the former director general of Communities NSW and the Department of Arts, Sport and Recreation. 

Whitehall sources believe Miss Mills is now unlikely to ever take up the post.

One said: ‘Her letter of appointment is more likely to end up in a museum than ever reaching the Queen.’

In
 a face-saving move, Mr Bercow yesterday said he would hold a 
consultation over whether the post should be split – with the clerk 
advising on constitutional matters and a new chief executive responsible
 for managing Parliament’s £200million budget.

Tory MP Crispin Blunt 
likened Mr Bercow’s retreat to the British Army’s ‘evacuation from 
hopeless positions’ at Dunkirk and Gallipoli.

Former Commons Speaker 
Betty Boothroyd warned that Miss Mills would be ‘totally out of her 
depth’. Senior Labour figures, including former foreign secretaries Jack
 Straw and Margaret Beckett, also raised concerns.

Opposition has 
been led by Conservative MPs, some of whom believe the appointment 
undermines Mr Bercow’s credibility.

Former Tory vice-chairman Michael 
Fabricant said the Speaker should stand down in 2015, adding: ‘This is 
going to get worse, not better. Mr Bercow yesterday insisted there was a
 ‘compelling’ case for splitting the clerk’s job because of the growing 
‘complexity’ of Commons affairs and budgets.

He added: ‘Thus, highly 
skilled management is now vital, as much as expertise in procedure.’ The
 move, which would require a change in the law, was called ‘very 
foolish’ by Tory MP Rob Wilson.

MPs meet today to decide whether to 
hold a full parliamentary debate on the issue. Mr Bercow indicated he 
would bow to pressure for Miss Mills to face a scrutiny hearing.

Experts
 have warned she could take legal action if her appointment is blocked 
or the job downgraded.

Deputy clerk David Natzler is also reported to be
 considering legal action after being overlooked.

But Mr Bercow said no legal action had so far been launched.

The Clerk of the House is the impartial main political adviser to the House, and adviser on all its procedure and business. 

They often appear before Select and Joint Committees to examine Parliamentary and constitutional matters.

They sit at the Table of the House, and wear court dress, with a barrister's wig and silk robes. The Clerks of the table are consulted by the Chair, Ministers, Whips, and MPs on any matter that may arise in the conduct of a sitting.

They also act as the Chief Executive of the House of Commons Service, which is made up of 2,000 people, and chairs the Management Board.

The current Clerk is Sir Robert Rogers, who has held the position since October 1, 2011, and was knighted the following year. On April 30, he announced he intended to retire at the end of August, after four decades in the House.
