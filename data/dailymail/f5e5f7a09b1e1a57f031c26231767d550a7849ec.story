The European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize yesterday, despite a year marked by rioting  and the prospect of an acrimonious break-up of the euro.

Awarding the prize, the Norwegian committee praised the EU for its  six decades of contributions 'to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights  in Europe'.

However, the announcement caused widespread bemusement and derision, with critics pointing out that it comes as the eurozone battles the worst recession for nearly a century.

The past 12 months have also seen Brussels help to push aside the democratically elected governments in Greece and Italy, and widespread civil unrest and rioting.

This week saw Greek citizens dressed as Nazis burn swastika flags to protest at a visit to Athens by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Last night former Chancellor Lord Lamont ridiculed the decision, saying: 'Today's decision seems preposterous and absurd.

'It would require a heart of stone not to die of laughter. It is the most ridiculous decision since the committee gave the peace prize to Barack Obama when he had been US President for two minutes.'

Norwegian Nobel committee chairman Thorbjoern Jagland today said the award was for the 'advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe'

The world's media gathered for the shock announcement at a press conference in Oslo, Norway

Nobel committee chairman  Thorbjoern Jagland acknowledged that the EU was facing 'grave  economic difficulties and considerable social unrest'.

But he insisted: 'The stabilising part played by the EU has helped to transform most of Europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace.' The announcement was greeted with glee in Brussels, where European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso added: 'The EU is something very precious.

We should cherish it for the good of Europeans and for the good of the entire world.'

And former prime minister Tony Blair said: 'The EU is one of the defining concepts of the last half century.

We would do well to remember that when the Second World War ended Europe was in ruins. What followed has been over 50 years of peace and progress.'

In winning the Nobel Peace Prize, the EU has joined an inglorious list of people and organisations, including:

Barack Obama was given the prize in 2009 – nine moths after his election –  for ‘strengthening international diplomacy’ shortly before his  escalation of the drone wars in Afghanistan. Critics claim he was actually handed it for being the first black President in US history Guatemalan Rigoberta Menchu won the prize in 1992 for her campaigns to help the poor. She was later exposed as having made up many of her achievements.

Here is a list of recipients in the last decade:2012: The European Union2011: Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberian activist Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karman of Yemen.2010: Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo.2009: US President Barack Obama 2008: Martti Ahtisaari, UN Special Envoy at the Kosovo status process talks2007: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Al Gore2006: Bangladeshi banker Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank2005: International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei2004: Kenyan enivronmental activist Wangari Maathai2003: Iranian lawyer and human rights campaigner Shirin Ebadi2002: Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter

However, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said: 'Never a week goes by that we don't see riots and protests in capital cities against the economic prison they have imposed. Rather than bring peace and harmony, the EU will cause insurgency and violence.'

Arch eurosceptic Bill Cash said: 'It is like giving an Oscar to a box office flop. It is thanks to Nato, the Marshall Plan and the help of the United States that Europe maintained peace after World War Two, certainly not the European Union.'

Ridicule also flowed in from the City, where businesses and banks fear a breakup of the euro. Peter Hargreaves, co-founder of financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'It's mad. It will be interesting to see if they take it back if Greece dissolves into martial law.'

'The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize for 2012 is to be awarded to the European Union (EU).

'The union and its forerunners have for over six decades contributed to the advancement of peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights in Europe.

'In the inter-war years, the Norwegian Nobel Committee made several awards to persons who were seeking reconciliation between Germany and France.

'Since 1945, that reconciliation has become a reality.

'The dreadful suffering in World War II demonstrated the need for a new Europe. Over a seventy-year period, Germany and France had fought three wars.

'Today war between Germany and France is unthinkable. This shows how, through well-aimed efforts and by building up mutual confidence, historical enemies can become close partners.

'In the 1980s, Greece, Spain and Portugal joined the EU. The introduction of democracy was a condition for their membership.

'The fall of the Berlin Wall made EU membership possible for several Central and Eastern European countries, thereby opening a new era in European history.

'The division between East and West has to a large extent been brought to an end; democracy has been strengthened; many ethnically-based national conflicts have been settled.

'The admission of Croatia as a member next year, the opening of membership negotiations with Montenegro, and the granting of candidate status to Serbia all strengthen the process of reconciliation in the Balkans. In the past decade, the possibility of EU membership for Turkey has also advanced democracy and human rights in that country.

'The EU is currently undergoing grave economic difficulties and considerable social unrest.

'The Norwegian Nobel Committee wishes to focus on what it sees as the EU's most important result: the successful struggle for peace and reconciliation and for democracy and human rights.

'The stabilizing part played by the EU has helped to transform most of Europe from a continent of war to a continent of peace.

'The work of the EU represents "fraternity between nations", and amounts to a form of the "peace congresses" to which Alfred Nobel refers as criteria for the Peace Prize in his 1895 will.'
