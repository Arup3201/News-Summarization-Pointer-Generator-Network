Britain's most famous midwife, who has delivered babies for celebrities including Thandie Newton, Davina McCall and Stella Tennant, says birth in Britain has become 'industrialised', and should be stripped back to a simpler and more natural experience.

Caroline Flint, 71, from Vauxhall in London, is the former president of the Royal College of Midwives, and has said she believes all babies should be given the opportunity to enter the world at home during a 'normal' and non-medical birth.

Speaking about her new guide to birthing for mothers, Do Birth, Flint told the Guardian's Susie Steiner: 'Most women can give birth perfectly well on their own without interference. Of course, some need a caesarean, some need extra medical care but most don't.'

She added: 'I think if women could start
off with a midwife in their home, whether they are high-risk or 
low-risk, and then if she needs to go into hospital, she can go with 
them. Much less intimidating.'

'A brutal entry into the world, where the baby is pulled out of his mother's body, accompanied 
by loud voices and bright lights, and then rubbed with a rough towel, 
teaches this oh-so-sensitive baby that the world is a tough place where he may not always be welcome.'

Flint says: 'Think of every genius you have ever heard
of and the likelihood is that they will have been born at home – 
Mozart, Beethoven, Einstein, Elgar'

Flint also says the theory that children born at home will not flourish academically (compared to those born in hospitals) is nonsense.

She says: 'Think of every genius you have ever heard of and the likelihood is that they will have been born at home - Mozart, Beethoven, Einstein, Elgar.'

Maintaing 'my life experience is that things very, very, very, very, very, very, very rarely go wrong', Flint also explains that some women have such an enjoyable experience giving birth that they can even reach orgasm - and the best place for this to happen is in the home.

She says: 'After the birth you will snuggle in bed with your beloved partner and gaze at your baby, telling each other how very clever you are...fragrant, joyful and transcendent.'

She adds: 'I can't imagine becoming sexually aroused in a brightly lit hospital. Can you?'

Making Preparations

In practical terms, to arrange to have your baby at home, you need to contact the community midwives in your area and ask them to book you in for a homebirth.

It is a fairly straightforward procedure. You can discuss it with the midwife at your booking-in appointment, or simply ring the community midwives directly.

In some areas, you email the homebirth team - every area is different. It is unlikely, though, that your doctor will know what you should do as this is not his or her area of expertise.

If you can't locate the number for the community midwives in your area, ring your local Maternity Hospital and ask them for it.

If you have no response, contact the Head of Midwifery at your local Maternity Hospital.

You may want to follow up your phone call with a letter so that you have a written record that you requested a homebirth.

Once you have booked yourself in for a homebirth, you will be allocated a midwife who will start to visit you regularly at home.

She will perform all your antenatal checks, such as taking your blood pressure and doing urine tests.

She will also feel your tummy to see how well your baby is growing. She will tell you what to get ready for the birth and will give you a number to ring when you think you are in labour.

When your due date approaches, she will bring all the things she will need for the birth and drop them off at your home. I keep saying 'she', but of course there are some male midwives, although the majority are women.
