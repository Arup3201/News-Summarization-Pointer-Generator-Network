Janet Bell, 43, believes she only has about six months to live unless she has a kidney transplant using an organ donated by a living donor

A woman who has been given just months to live unless she has a kidney transplant is so desperate to find a donor she has placed an advert in her local newspaper.

Janet Bell, 43, was diagnosed with kidney failure 17 years ago and has already had two transplants.

The second transplanted kidney has now failed and she is dependent on daily dialysis to keep her alive.

But, her veins have been so badly damaged by years of dialysis that doctors are finding it increasingly difficult to find somewhere to insert a needle for the dialysis.

As a result, she will die if a live donor is not found soon.

The beauty salon owner told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I can’t stand the idea of just lying there waiting to die. I’ve asked friends and family, I’ve asked customers in my salon. I even put a status on Facebook but I still can’t find a match.

‘Short of walking down the street with a sandwich board on, there’s nothing else I can do. This advert is my last hope of survival.’

Ms Bell, from Cheshire, was first diagnosed with kidney failure in 1997 and she has since received two transplants from deceased donors.

She had the first operation when she was 26 but her body rejected the new kidney meaning she had to have a second transplant.

She was on the waiting list for eight years before eventually receiving another new kidney. This has now failed as well.

As a result, she now needs another transplant.

However,
this time she needs a live donor as the antibody levels in her body are
so high it would be impossible to find a deceased donor whose kidney 
her body would not reject.

An
antibody is a protein substance that is made by the body's immune 
system in response to a foreign object - such as a transplanted organ.

Ms Bell is so desperate to find a kidney donor she has placed an advertisement in her local paper, the Cheshire Chronicle, appealing for potential donors to come forward

These antibodies will attack a transplanted kidney if it is seen as a foreign object.

As a result, all potential donors have to be screened to see if they have antigens which react with the recipient's antibodies.

As
she has already had two transplants, Ms Bell has so many antibodies her body would reject any new kidney she received from a deceased donor.

Ms Bell is currently dependent on daily dialysis for her survival but she has had so many years of dialysis her veins are damaged and doctors are finding it increasingly difficult to find somewhere to insert the needle

This means she has to find a living donor.

Ms
Bell told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Dialysis is only buying me time. Without a
living donor I probably have about six months or a year left at most.’

She explained that she is desperate for a new kidney as she wants to be around to look after her parents as they get older.

She said it is heart-breaking to think of them having to watch her die before them.

In a last ditch attempt to find a donor, Ms Bell placed an advertisement in the Chester Chronicle.

It read: ‘My name is Jan and I've got just months to live unless I can find a live kidney donor.

Ms Bell told the Sunday Mirror: 'I can't stand the idea of just lying there waiting to die. I've asked friends and family, I've asked customers in my salon. I even put a status on Facebook but I still can't find a match'

‘This is my last chance as I've tried everything and not found a match. If you would be willing to help save my life and donate a kidney please call for more information.'

Ms Bell told ITV’s Daybreak that she has already had one response to the advert.

She said: ‘It’s a start, which is great.’

However, she went on to explain that the chance of that person being a match is very small meaning she needs more people to come forward to give her the best chance possible.
