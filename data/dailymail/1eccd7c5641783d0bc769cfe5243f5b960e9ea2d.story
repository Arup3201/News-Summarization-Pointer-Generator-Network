A former-supermodel-turned-parliamentary candidate is under investigation for allegedly throttling a bus driver in a row over luggage.

Turkish model Tugba Ozay, 37, had flown to the city of Antalya in south-western Turkey where she went to get an airline coach to transfer to a resort two hours away.

But the trip was disrupted when she and the bus driver broke out in a heated row over where she could put her luggage.

A Turkish bus driver claims former supermodel Tugba Ozay (pictured) throttled him during an argument

Bus driver Halil Kizliyer said he attempted to put her bags in the undercarriage like everyone else's when the row broke out

Driver Halil Kizilyer, 28, said: 'I went to put her bags in the undercarriage holdall like everyone else's and she started getting angry saying she wanted to keep it on her.

'I explained that she had too many bags and they wouldn't fit on the coach and she went ballistic.

'She grabbed me by the throat and started squeezing my neck and screaming that she was going to have me fired.'

Passenger Ahmet Buze, 27, said: 'I of course recognised her straight-away as she's very famous.

'But she seemed to think that she was entitled to special privileges and when she attacked the driver I was completely shocked.

'I took out my phone and began videoing it but then one of her security people or whoever he was came over and made me delete it.'

Ozay, who was the highest paid model in Turkey at the height of her career, is now running for parliament with the centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP).

When questioned by local media over the incident, she said: 'The matter is not important. We have also filed a complaint against him.'

A police spokesman said: 'We are aware of the allegations and we are looking into what happened.'
