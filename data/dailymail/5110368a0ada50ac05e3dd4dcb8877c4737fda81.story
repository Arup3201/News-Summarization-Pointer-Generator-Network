The bigger a CEO's signature the more likely he or she is to be a narcissist, a new study claims.

The research which compared the signatures of some 605 CEOs of U.S. firms found that size does matter where boss's autographs are concerned.

It found that bosses with bigger signatures also tended to get the highest pay, but were in fact more likely to run their companies into the ground.

The study by academics at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina took 
the signatures of CEOs from company accounts filings with the U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission.

The authors identify narcissism as an egotistical character trait 'associated with conceit and disregard for others'.

'Similarly, narcissism creates biased self-perception in the form of upwardly biased evaluation of one’s own abilities and performance,' they say in the paper.

These qualities make them bad decision makers, the study says, but enables them to convince directors and shareholders of their competency to the extent that they get better pay.

Professor Sean Wang, one of three authors of the study, told ABC News
that the 605 signatures analysed were found largely on annual reports 
and other documents filed by S&P 500 companies as of July 2011.

The S&P 500 index tracks the most valuable 500 companies listed on U.S. stock markets.

Signatures
were fed into a custom coded computer program which drew a rectangle 
around each of them and measured the area they covered.

'We standardized the measure by dividing the area by the number letters in the CEO's signature,' Professor Wang said.

Professor Wang said he and his 
co-authors relied on findings from previous psychological studies which 
claimed that bigger signatures mean bigger egos.

Using
the size of the signature as a proxy for the writers' narcissism, they 
found that 'narcissistic CEOs invest more in capital expenditures and 
acquisitions but pay lower dividends, with overinvestments being largest
in magnitude when financial slack is high.

Aggressive managers who bully their staff are more likely to enjoy career success than even their more competent rivals because people are impressed by their dominance, a study claims.

Researchers found that people who were dominant had a greater influence on others, and could be easily and quickly picked out of a crowd.

In a two part study, 200 participants completed a problem-solving task in small groups while being videotaped, with volunteers rating each other's dominance, prestige and influence during the task, as well as their own.

The researchers defined prestige as the appearance of skill and competency, and dominance as having the ability to impose ideas on others through bullying and intimidation.

Results showed those who were more dominant or prestigious had a greater influence on the task and were seen as more influential by the participants.

In the second part, 60 extra participants watched a total of 120 seconds of short videos of the initial group interactions while wearing an eye-tracking device.

The University of British Columbia team found these participants paid significantly greater attention to individuals who appeared more dominant or prestigious, indicating their higher levels of influence.

The study also revealed while participants preferred leaders with prestige, they were more likely to choose dominant leaders, and were more forgiving of their behaviour.

'In
addition, narcissistic CEOs exhibit worse performance as measured by 
the contemporaneous return on assets, with the effects being largest 
when operating environments are most uncertain.

'Despite
the negative relationship between narcissism and firm performance, 
these CEOs receive both higher cash and stock compensation, as well as 
higher compensation relative to the next highest paid executive at their
firm.'

However, other experts where sceptical
of the paper's conclusions because of its assumption that a larger 
signature correlates to a bigger ego.

James Westerman and Jacqueline Bergman of Appalachian State University told ABC that other factors can determine signature size, including high self-esteem and an extroverted personality.

They also said that if high self-esteem was what lay behind a company boss's oversized autograph, it's possible that the firm could even benefit from such positive self assurance.

Professor Wang conceded this could be the case, but countered that he and his colleagues do not claim to have found a one-to-one correspondence between large signatures and badly run companies, merely that the relationship holds true on average.

To illustrate the point the researchers compared the relative performance of two companies competing in the same industry to the size of their CEOs' signatures.

Dell boss Michael Dell has a smaller scribble that Hewlett Packard boss Carly Fiorina, and HP underperformed Dell by getting a lower return on its investments.

Professor Wang told ABC that the CEO they studied with the biggest signature was Timothy Koogle, former boss Yahoo as CEO between 1995 and 2001, and chairman between 1999 and 2003.

Even allowing for the fact that Mr Koogle led Yahoo during the rise and fall of the internet bubble, the professor said he very much fitted their model.

The signatures of high-profile figures came under the spotlight in the U.S. last month when Barack Obama formally nominated White House chief of staff Jacob 'Jack' Lew for the post of Treasury Secretary.

If Mr Lew is confirmed as Treasury Secretary his 'childish' signature - which has been compared to a curly French fry - will grace the dollar bill.

The President joked that he had considered abandoning the nomination after learning of Mr Lew's bizarre and illegible signature.
