It’s taken 144 years for a statue of Charles Dickens to be built in Britain.

And his great-great-great-grandchildren took no time in snapping a selfie with him.

The life-size bronze sculpture of the writer was unveiled today in Portsmouth, the city of his birth, on what would have been his 202nd birthday.

The £140,000 bronze sculpture is the first statue of the author in Britain after he expressed a dying wish for no monument to be made of him after his death

The likeness was unveiled on what would have been the 19th century author's 202nd birthday

Great-great-great grandson Oliver Dickens, nine, said: ‘It feels really special. I’ve read his books and love Oliver Twist the best.’

There has been a 20-year row over whether a statue of the great novelist should ever be erected – because it is against his dying wishes.

The £140,000 statue was commissioned despite Dickens writing in his will that he should never be made the ‘subject of any monument, memorial or testimonial’.

More than 40 descendants of the 19th 
century novelist attended the ceremony at Portsmouth's Guildhall Square 
which is less than a mile from the house where he was born 202 years ago
 today.

The statue has 
been created by sculptor Martin Jennings whose previous subjects include
 Sir John Betjeman at St Pancras Station, London, and Philip Larkin in 
Hull.

The over life-size statue in bronze, which cost £140,000, features Dickens sitting down surrounded by books.

It is not the first of Dickens' posthumous requests to be ignored - his decision to be buried at Rochester Cathedral was over-ruled and he was instead laid to rest at Westminster Abbey

While it may be the first statue in Britain, another statue was erected in Philadelphia, USA, in 1891 and another created later in Sydney, Australia

Following his stroke in 1870, the writer's other wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral was over-ruled

Mr
 Jennings said: 'I wanted the statue to express Dickens's energy, the 
richness of his imagination and the abundance of his output.

'It's also quite theatrical, fitting I
 hope for a man who loved the stage. It's taken many months to make but I
 hope people think it does justice to the great man.'

Having the statue built is not the first of Dickens' dying wishes to be ignored.

Following
 his stroke in 1870, his other wish to be buried at Rochester Cathedral 
was over-ruled and he was laid to rest in Poets' Corner at Westminster 
Abbey.

Another statue was erected in Philadelphia, USA, in 1891 and another created later in Sydney, Australia.

Defending
 the decision to create a statue for Portsmouth, Professor Tony Pointon,
 chair of the Charles Dickens statue committee, said: 'He did not 
mention a statue, he didn't say 'I do not want a statue', he didn't want
 a monument for his funeral, he didn't want a funerary monument, in fact
 he sat for three sculptors when he was alive.'

Oliver
 Mark Charles Dickens, 21, another great-great-great-grandson, from 
Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said: "Dickens touched so many people and the 
best thing about the statue is that it is at ground level so people can 
interact with it, can touch it.

While Dickens' family said they were happy with the likeness, one protester objected and covered the statue with a sheet saying 'it's not what he would have wanted'

The statue is in Guildhall Square, less than a mile away from the house where he was born

'We are 202 years from his birth, he has made us so proud as a family and we are giving something back.

'I do not feel we are taking liberties, we want to celebrate him, not annoy him.'

Stage
 and screen actor Edward Fox and his wife Joanna David gave a reading at
 the unveiling and they were joined in the Guildhall Square by members 
of the Pickwick Cycle Club on their penny farthing bicycles.

Mark
 Charles Dickens, a great-great-grandson, and head of the Dickens family
 said: 'The Dickens Family is delighted that a statue of our famous 
ancestor will at long last be erected in this country, and most fitting 
that it should be on his 202nd birthday in the city of his birth, where 
by coincidence his mistress and childhood sweetheart are also buried.

'This
 is the culmination of years of hard work by many dedicated people and 
we really hope that this magnificent statue will stimulate and inspire 
future generations to discover the genius of his writing and his 
passionate campaign for social justice.'

Ian Dickens, a great great grandson of Charles Dickens, stands with the statue. The Charles Dickens statue committee has spent 20 years raising funds for the sculpture

Councillor Lee Hunt, Portsmouth City Council cabinet member for culture said: 'Everyone living, working or visiting in the city is welcome to witness the first UK Charles Dickens statue.

'This is a marvellous tribute to an incredible man. Everyone in Portsmouth should feel immensely proud that the statue of Dickens is here in his home town.'

Other guests at the event included the youngest member of the family 26-month-old Joe Robinson who is a great-great-great-great-grandson while two members of the Dickens Pickwick Club, Michael O'Reilly and Dennis Babcock travelled from America specifically for the unveiling.
