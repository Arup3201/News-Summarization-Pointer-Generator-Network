Last year Brazilian oil tycoon and seventh richest man on the planet Eike Batista had a total wealth of $34 billion. 

But the 56-year-old, who bankrolled the bid to bring the 2016 Olympics to his home country, has gone from top of the pile to number 100 on the Forbes rich list after losing $33 billion over 16 months.

It is a big drop for a man who had boasted of his plans to take over from Mexican Carlos Slim as the richest man in the world.

Losses: Eike Batista has lost billions of dollars, and his place as the seventh richest man in the world

The father-of-two, who bought his first gold mine at the age of 24, lost a vast chunk of his fortune when his oil conglomerate, OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA, lost 90 per cent of its value over the past year, leaving Mr Batista with an estimated net worth of $200 million when the debts he owes to investors have been deducted, according to the Huffington Post.

The charismatic tycoon, known for his love of speedboats, had told Bloomberg last year that he exemplified a 'Brazilian dream' of entrepreneurial success.

However, it is claimed that the businessman may have been overly optimistic with his investments at a time when Brazil's economy was faltering.

'His loss of credibility is explained by
not delivering on the results promised when he listed his companies,' 
Elad Revi, an investment analyst in Sao Paulo told Bloomberg. 'There was a chain reaction: he lost credibility in 
one, then he lost it in all of them.'

While his loss hasn't expelled him from Forbes' top 100 billionaire list, it was a long way to fall for a man used to success.

Even in his private life, Mr Batista was on to a winning streak. He has won the World Championships in powerboat racing in the 1990s, and in 2006 he broke a speed record on his $19 million super yacht Spirit of Brazil, according to Elite Choice.

The Brazilian had a reputation for his luxurious lifestyle, which included a fleet of private jets as well as a $1.2 million Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren which he kept parked in the lounge of his Rio home.

The car was crashed by his 20-year-old son last year, when he knocked over a cyclist who later died. Thor Batista was sentenced to two years' community service and fined $500,000 for the fatal crash in June, according to Fox News.

During an interview with the billionaire in 2008, a Bloomberg reporter noted that he conducted meetings in his office overlooking Sugarloaf mountain, while hooked up to an IV drip feeding him vitamins in an effort to delay aging.

'I think big, and I'm not afraid to take risks - even if I'm alone,' Mr Batista said at the time. 'I started out in the gold business. I know about risk and loss and having to build a business from scratch when nobody believes in you.'

Ambition: Eike Batista had boasted of plans to become the richest man in the world

The businessman, who has invested a large part of his fortune in his beloved city, Rio, over the years, has vowed to make sure any debts from his current losses are cleared.

'I will honor all of my obligations. I won’t leave a single
penny unpaid for each one of my debts,' he said.

He has also reminded investors that his companies still have billions of dollars of available cash and told his 1.3 million Twitter followers that anyone who bet against him would be 'caught with their pants down', the New York Times reported.
