A multi-millionaire football club chairman accused of making anti-Semitic and racist remarks faced calls to quit last night.

Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan provoked a storm of criticism by reportedly saying Jews ‘chase money’ and suggesting it was acceptable to call Chinese people ‘chinks’.

Yesterday the 77-year-old tried to defend himself by insisting he has ‘hundreds and hundreds of Jewish friends’ – but Jonathan Arkush, of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, branded the alleged comments ‘outrageous and offensive’.

He added: ‘His half-hearted apology does not go far enough. You cannot insult a whole group of people, and then say, “I would never insult them”, and hope that’s OK.’

Mr Whelan’s comments reportedly came as he tried to defend his appointment of Malky Mackay as the club’s new manager. Mr Mackay is currently the subject of a Football Association investigation following offensive texts he allegedly sent while manager of Cardiff City.

However, Mr Whelan is said to have found little offence in messages referring to Cardiff’s Malaysian owner Vincent Tan as a ‘chink’, or others referring to Jewish people pursuing money.

Labour MP Ivan Lewis, who is Jewish, told BBC Radio Manchester that both men appeared to share the same ‘abhorrent anti-Semitic and racist views’.

Calling for the Wigan chairman to step down, he added: ‘In my view the FA has to now take the toughest possible action against Dave Whelan.’ Yesterday Mr Whelan apologised for causing any offence – but the controversy deepened as he tried to justify his comments, saying: ‘I would never, ever insult a Jewish person. I have got hundreds and hundreds of Jewish friends.’

He had reportedly told The Guardian: ‘The Jews don’t like losing money. Nobody likes losing money.’

He later told the BBC: ‘I don’t think there’s anything wrong in chasing money, because we work for it’. Claiming he also had ‘loads of Chinese friends’, he said: 

‘If somebody says to a Chinaman “You’re a chink”, would he be upset about it? I don’t know really. If he was, I would say “I’m very sorry, I won’t call you that again”.’ 

Mr Tan reacted angrily to Mr Whelan’s comments, saying: ‘This is a racist chairman hiring a racist manager.’ He said he thought Mr Whelan had ‘insulted the dignity’ of all Jewish and Chinese people.

Vincent Tan reacted angrily to Mr Whelan, saying: ‘This is a racist chairman hiring a racist manager' 

Anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out called for tough action against Mr Whelan, saying: ‘He has brought into question whether he is a fit and proper person who should be running a professional football club.’ 

However, Hull manager Steve Bruce claimed that words ‘can be misplaced’, while former England manager Graham Taylor described Mr Whelan as ‘good and honest’.

The FA has launched an investigation into the matter.
