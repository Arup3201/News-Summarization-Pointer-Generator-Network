Chancellor George Osborne, pictured today at the Tory party conference, said he will spend more than £800million to enable local authorities to avoid painful increases

Council tax is to be frozen again next year as the Government tries to show it understands the mounting pressures on family budgets, it was revealed today.

Chancellor George Osborne said he will spend more than £800million to enable local authorities to avoid painful increases.

The freeze will save the average family £72 next year, on top of another £72 saved from a similar move this year, and means council tax will not rise before April 2013 at the earliest.

'My message is I am doing everything, this Government is doing everything to help you, your family, to help the economy, to get people into work, to keep people in work,' he told ITV1's Daybreak.

'That is what we are working flat-out on. We reject the idea that governments can't do anything in the face of these global storms.

'My job is to take the difficult decisions that help families to put food on the table and keep the people in work who bring home the bread. That's my job.

'We are working flat-out, using every tool available to us. We are not standing on the sidelines.'

No U-turn: David Cameron said he understood the shocks family finances were experiencing but said there 'was something better at the end of this'

He
 said the heart of the Government's economic policies remained the 
overriding need to get the state deficit down, in order to maintain the 
confidence of the markets and keep interest rates low.

Mr Osborne will say: ‘I want to help families and pensioners with the cost of living.’

The
 spending commitment, to be funded from ‘underspends’ in Whitehall, 
comes as a surprise after repeated Government claims that there is no 
room in the public finances for tax cuts.

The Institute of Directors has said the top rate of tax should be cut to help growth

The body wants the 50 per cent income tax rate for the highest earners to be scrapped 'to kill the perception that the UK is a high-tax country'.

It also wants corporation tax to be slashed from 26 per cent to 15 per cent by 2020 to create more jobs.

Employment regulation needs to be shaken up to stop the 'gradual erosion of the UK's flexible labour market' to encourage businesses to take on more staff, it argues.

They also want state spending to be cut from 47.1 per cent of GDP 35 per cent by 2020.

IoD director-general Simon Walker said: 'No aspect of economic policy is more important than returning Britain to a growth trajectory.

'Without the belief that UK economic growth is expanding, confidence will wane, international investment will dwindle and British consumers and taxpayers will be left picking up the crumbs at the tables of faster-growing competitors.

He also called for spending on infrastructure projects to be protected and for the Bank of England to announce a return to quantitative easing for the first time in nearly two years on Thursday by injecting a further £50 billion into the economy.

The
 Chancellor is also thought to be planning to use more unspent money 
from Government departments to inject into capital projects to try to 
kickstart the flatlining economy.

Both
 Mr Osborne and the Prime Minister will insist the cash can be found 
without deviating an inch from the Government’s tight deficit reduction 
plans.

As the Conservative 
party conference started in Manchester yesterday, David Cameron said 
there were ‘elements of truth’ to the idea that Britain was in the 
economic equivalent of a war.

He said the debt crisis engulfing the eurozone was a threat not just to the British economy but that of the entire world.

The Prime Minister ruled out any 
U-turn on spending cuts, but went out of his way to suggest that he 
understood the ‘shocks’ to family finances. ‘We have got to explain to 
people there is something better at the end of this,’ he declared.

‘I
 think one of the biggest shocks for people has been the electricity 
increases, the gas increases. Put that on top of what’s happening to the
 family shop, what’s happened at the petrol pumps . . . these things 
combined are making life difficult.

‘We are doing the right thing, but we’ve got to explain all the time why it’s necessary, how we’re going to help people.’

Council tax in England doubled under Labour, with the average bill for a Band D home rising to £1,439 a year.

In other developments at the Conservative conference:

The Government has been under pressure from Tory MPs to complement austerity measures with a coherent strategy for growth and measures to put cash in the pockets of hardworking families.

Up to two million council houses could be sold to their tenants under plans to revive Margaret Thatcher’s ‘Right to Buy’ scheme.

Ministers are to offer heavy discounts – worth up to 50 per cent – to persuade people to buy their homes. The proceeds will then be ploughed back directly into building new houses in the area.

David Cameron suggested yesterday that the new drive could result in another 100,000 homes for rent being built, creating 200,000 jobs. Right To Buy was one of the most popular policies of the Thatcher era. Discounts of up to 60 per cent were offered, encouraging some two million tenants to buy their council homes between 1980 and 1998.

Although the scheme continued under Labour, the level of discount was capped by John Prescott at a maximum of £38,000. Last year just 3,690 homes were sold under the scheme. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said local authorities would be required to replace every council house sold on a ‘one-for-one basis’.

And he said limits would be set to ensure that council tenants in fashionable areas were not turned into overnight ‘millionaires’.

Mr Cameron also announced that thousands of acres of  publicly-owned land are to be released by the Government  for house building, which has fallen to the lowest level since the 1920s.

The Prime Minister insisted: ‘We are firing up the engines of the British economy.

‘There is a step change taking place right now. This Government is not just sitting back.’

Aides said the Chancellor will use his address to the conference today to accept that the cost of living is ‘the big issue’ for most families.

But he will insist that the deficit reduction plan is more important than ever, given the debt crisis overwhelming countries such as Greece.

A resolution to the turmoil in the eurozone, he will say, would be the biggest single boost to confidence in Britain.

The Chancellor will insist that he has a longer term plan for growth, highlighting his plan to cut corporation tax to the lowest level in the G20 group of leading nations.

He will also confirm that the qualifying period for unfair dismissal claims is to rise from one to two years, as the Daily Mail revealed last week.

Last night Mr Osborne announced plans to set up new enterprise zones to deal with the fallout from the decision by defence giant BAE Systems to slash 3,000 jobs in the north of England.

The zones will encourage firms to expand or relocate to the BAE sites at Warton and Samlesbury, in Lancashire, and Brough, in East Yorkshire.

Angela Eagle, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘David Cameron is so out of touch with what’s happening to jobs and the cost of living that he seems more interested in protecting a plan that isn’t working than protecting our economy.

‘With unemployment rising and the recovery choked off last autumn the Prime Minister is stuck with the old lines and has nothing new to say.’

Warning: Lord Ashcroft says David Cameron must convince voters over the budget deficit if he is to win an outright majority in the 2015 General Election

David Cameron must do more than convince voters he is right about cutting Britain’s towering budget deficit if he is to win an outright majority at the next election, Lord Ashcroft warns today.

The former deputy party chairman and polling guru says it is clear that Conservative support has held up since Mr Cameron entered Downing Street, despite economic turmoil and unpopular spending cuts.

Many voters have decided that Ed Miliband is ‘weird’, Lord Ashcroft’s latest research shows, and the Prime Minister remains far and away the best-rated of the three main party leaders.

The proportion of 2010 Tory voters staying with the party who give Mr Cameron very high marks for his performance has actually increased over the year, the peer says in an article for the Daily Mail.

But while Conservative voters back the Coalition’s focus on the deficit and are relatively ‘sanguine’ about cuts, those whom the party needs to win over to gain an outright victory in 2015 are more concerned about the impact on public services. Lord Ashcroft argues that Mr Cameron must demonstrate that deficit reduction is part of a broader economic strategy for restoring growth.

Floating voters see the deficit as part of a range of issues to be dealt with, including tackling crime and improving schools and hospitals.Lord Ashcroft’s poll of 8,000 adults showed people feel ‘uncertain’ and ‘anxious’ about the economy, and were not confident Britain would be in a better state even in three or four years’ time.

The rising cost of living, he said, was a recurring theme. The NHS is widely thought to be suffering because of budget cuts, though in fact the Coalition has protected its budget.

Voters also said they hoped for a tougher approach to immigration from a Conservative-led government, but were not clear that it was being delivered.
