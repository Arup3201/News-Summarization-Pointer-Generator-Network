The great grandson of Ernest Hemingway has run with the bulls in Pamplona exactly ninety years after the author visited the festival for the first time.

Michael Hemingway took pictures of the famous run. Ernest Hemingway made the festival so famous it now attracts around one million visitors.

Dressed in white with a red neckerchief Hemingway junior joined several thousand other thrill seekers as they sprinted through the narrow cobbled streets of Pamplona chased by six half-tonne Iberian fighting bulls and six steers.

In 1923 Hemingway made his first visit to San Fermin to cover the nine-day festival for Canada's Toronto Star, a visit he used as the basis for his novel 'Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises'.

The fiesta in northern Spain is now one of the biggest street parties in the world and each year the population swells from just under 200,000 to more than a million as people travel from all over the world to experience it.

Since Hemingway's visit there are some notable changes, back then women were not allowed to take part in the morning runs, when the bulls charge from one end of the old quarter to the other to be killed that evening in the bullring.

Topical: The Sun Also Rises is a 1926 novel written by American author Ernest Hemingway about a group of American and British expatriates who travel from Paris to the Festival of San Fermín in Pamplona to watch the running of the bulls and the bullfights

The event demands nerves of steel, quick relfexes and the ability to run like the wind.

During Spain's infamous running of the bulls, thousands of daredevils race through the streets of Pamplona - with a herd of bulls hot on their heels.

Runners - or 'mozos' - raced through the streets of the northern Spanish city of Pamplona today in a hair-raising but relatively clean second bull run of the famed annual San Fermin festival. 

Run! The festival is a symbol of Spanish culture that attracts thousands of tourists to watch the bull runs despite heavy condemnation from animal rights groups

Look out! The annual Fiesta de San Fermin was made famous by the 1926 novel 'The Sun Also Rises' by Ernest Hemmingway

The daredevils - quickly followed by the bulls - run through the historic heart of Pamplona for nine days as part of the adrenalin-fuelled fiesta

There were no gorings in the run and four people were treated in city hospitals for injuries suffered in falls, Navarra Hospital chief Javier Sesma said.

The early morning race saw thrill-seekers dashing alongside six fighting bulls and six bell-tinkling steers that try to keep the creatures together along the narrow 930-yard (850-meter) course from a holding pen to the city bull ring. Today's run lasted just over two minutes.

The run is televised nationally and is the highlight of the nine-day street partying festival, which became world famous following the 1926 publication of Ernest Hemingway's novel 'The Sun Also Rises.'

'Never again,' said Jonathan 
Chadwick, 31, an engineer from Auckland, New Zealand, who said it was 
his 'first and last time' to run.

Rex Ryan also  spent part of his summer vacation running from angry bulls.

The New York Jets coach came to the event too.

The team confirmed Monday that Ryan was uninjured while participating both days in the run.

Ben Patton, a contestant on NBC's matchmaker show "Ready for Love," tweeted an Instagram photo of himself and some friends posing with Ryan in Pamplona.

Well, it's something to do! Rex Ryan ran twice with the bulls and hung out at the Fiesta de San Fermin. Photographic evidence of the Jets coach wearing a 'Bad Toro' T-shirt surfaced at the weekend courtesy of Ben Patton

The heart-stopping run and subsequent parties were originally organised in honor of San Fermin, patron saint of Navarra

The origin of the controversial fiesta stems from the need to move the bulls from the off-site corrals to the bullring where they would be killed in the evening.

Foolish youngsters would dash in amongst the creatures to prove their bravery.

In Pamplona the festival is run to honour San Fermin, the city's saint, and runs between July 6 and 14.

Runners wear red and white, ask San Fermin for protection, and hold rolled up newspapers in case they need to distract the bulls.

They run from the corrals, through the streets, before finally ending in the bull ring.

Each year hundreds of people are injured, and occasionally killed, in the fiesta.

Three Spaniards and a 41-year-old man from Pheonix, Arizona, were injured but none were in a serious condition, according to the Navarra regional government press office.

The bulls that are run each morning are invariably killed in evening bull fights, and their meat is served up in Pamplona's restaurants.

Animals rights groups have previously slammed the event, branding it cruel to the bulls forced to run.

A PETA spokesman slammed the event, and called for a boycott of the annual festival.They said: 'In this day and age, it's appalling that sensitive animals are still being tormented and killed in front of a screaming crowd.

'PETA and Spanish group AnimaNaturalis are joining compassionate people from around the world in condemning this cruel blood sport – and in urging tourists to stay far away from the bullfights.'

The heart-stopping run and subsequent parties were originally organised in honor of San Fermin, patron saint of Navarra, although the religious aspect has now faded.

The bull run begins with the runners 
chanting for protection as they stand just a few metres up the slope 
from the corral where the bulls are waiting.

They
raise their rolled newspapers and chant to an image of San Fermin 
placed in a small recess in the wall in the Cuesta de Santo Domingo.

Against
a backdrop of silence, they chant: 'A San Fermin pedimos, por ser 
nuestro patron, nos guie en el encierro dandonos su bendicion,' 
translated as: 'We ask San Fermin, being our patron saint, to guide us 
in the bull run and give us his blessing'.

When they finish they shout 'Viva San Fermin!, Gora San Fermin,' the official website said.

This chant is sung three times before 8am, until the gates are opened and the bulls released.

After the launching of two rockets, the bulls charge behind the runners for 825 metres, the distance between the corral and the bullring.

When a third rocket is fired from the bullring it signals that all the bulls have entered the bullring.

A
fourth and final rocket declares that all the bulls are safely in the 
corral located inside the bullring, and that the bull run has ended.

Although Pamplona is arguably the most famous of places for the running of the bulls, the tradition is carried out around Spain.

But in one place, people ended up swimming, rather than running, with the bulls.

Many jump into the sea during the traditional ''Bous a la Mar' festival in the eastern Spanish coastal town of Denia, near Alicante.

Boats could be seen sailing up to the bulls to help guide them to shore afterwards.

During this festival, revellers emerging from protective barriers provoke bulls to chase them until they both fall into sea. The bulls are then rescued by small boats which will tow them to safety.

Animal rights groups have criticised the nationwide event, which sees bulls chase people - even into the sea
