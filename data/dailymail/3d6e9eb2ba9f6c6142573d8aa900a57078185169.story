It's enough to make you open another box of Christmas chocolates.

For when we were stuffing our faces, gorging on mince pies and turkey with all the trimmings over the festive period, these Victoria's Secret models were showing off their stunning svelte physiques on a paradise beach.

The lingerie brand's Angels Candice Swanepoel, 26, Behati Prinsloo, 25, Lais Ribeiro, 24, Andreea Diaconu, 23, and Lily Aldridge, 29, cavorted in skimpy bikinis on a dream Hawaiian coastline for the new Swim 2015 campaign.

Their lithe bodies were proof that unlike the rest of us, these women had steered clear of fattening festive fare.

And just weeks earlier, the Amazons were strutting their stuff in heels, undies and ornate angels' wings in London at the Victoria's Secret fashion show.

But the lengths the models go to, to ensure their bodies are in tip top shape for the show is legendary. 

Candice soaks up the rays while on the shoot for the brand's new swimwear wearing Very Sexy Double-strap Plunge One-piece $98.50

Behati smoulders during the shoot wearing Very Sexy One-shoulder Triangle Top $42.50 & Very Sexy Double-strap Cheeky $38.50, left, and Very Sexy The Hottie Halter $58.50 & Very Sexy The Cut-out Itsy $32.50, right

From intense stationary bike workout, SoulCycling, and  BalletBeautiful classes to boxing, the women train like they're entering an athletic event. 

Unlike most mere mortals, they don't stop for Christmas. 

Lily Aldridge told US magazine Life & Style, 'Being an Angel, you're in shape all year long.'

The Victoria's Secret shoot took place on a beach in Hawaii with the Angels - Nadine Leopold is pictured wearing Beach Sexy The Lace Midi Beach Bandeau $52.50 & Beach Sexy The Lace Itsy $22.50

Candice, left, wearing Very Sexy Drape-back One-piece $88.50, and, right Lais in The Bombshell Add-2-cups Push-up Halter $66.50 & The Knockout Bikini Bottom $46.50

Two months before the December fashion show she begins to prep for the event eating lean protein, low-glycaemic fruit and vegetables. 

Alcohol is the first to go.   

'The big thing I cut out is wine and then a week before the show, I stop salty foods.' 

The Victoria's Secret 2015 swimwear is divided into three main trends: boho, sporty and sexy.

The Swim 2015 campaign video opens and pans around a lush tropical locale, before settling on the models standing provocatively on boulders and inside caves, their perfect silhouettes stark against the crystal sea.

South African-born Candice posed in a selection of clinging strappy black bikinis either on her knees in the sand, or leaning provocatively against a rock face.

Lily, who is married to Kings of Leon singer Caleb Followill, is seen lying in the surf in a pink and black printed cut-away swimsuit.

Brazilian beauty, Lais Ribeiro, reclines on the beach in a white costume with the sides cut out and tassels dangling from the hips. 

There are shots of lingering close-ups, sweat-dewed thighs and seductive expressions. The models float in the sea, or lie on the sand, arching their backs as the sun sets or standing alone on the rocks as the waves crash beneath them.
