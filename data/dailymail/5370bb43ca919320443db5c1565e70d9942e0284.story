Professor Sir Roger Boyle told the BBC that care at the centre at the Leeds children's heart unit was 'on the edge of acceptability'

A senior National Health Service executive has declared he would not want his daughter treated at the crisis-hit child heart unit in Leeds.

Professor Sir Roger Boyle spoke out only days after the centre reopened after it was shut at short notice because of data he leaked on its comparative death rates.

Sir Roger, who now oversees NHS death rate data but was national director for heart disease until 2011, said that care at Leeds was ‘on the edge of acceptability’.

The father of a ten-year-old daughter, Amy, and three grown-up sons, he said: ‘I tell you that I have a young daughter, I would go somewhere else. I would go to Newcastle.’

His comments will alarm parents and enrage supporters of the unit at Leeds General Infirmary. They want him to be sacked, accusing him of  ‘conducting a cynical vendetta’.

Paediatric heart surgery at Leeds  was suspended at the end of last month after data leaked by Sir Roger appeared to show death rates running at twice the national average.

Surgeons at other units also raised concerns and parents told of children who were lucky to be alive.

But others claimed the closure was politically motivated as it came just 24 hours after the High Court quashed plans to close the centre as part of measures to streamline  children’s heart services.

The hospital insisted the data was incomplete and that full figures would confirm the unit to be safe.Surgery resumed earlier this week and NHS England said it was satisfied that immediate safety concerns had been dealt with.

However, Sir Roger’s comments on  Radio 4’s The Report programme will reignite the controversy.

He insisted that, despite safety assurances, a comprehensive analysis of the data showed the unit should remain under supervision.

‘We find they’re just on the edge of what we call an alert.

‘In other words, showing that they were right on the edge of acceptability,’ he said.

Children's heart surgery at the hospital was suspended at the end of last month after data showed the unit had a death rate double that of other centres. It re-opened again on Wednesday

Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said that the quality of its  service had been independently  verified during a rapid review.

A spokesman added: ‘This was publicly reconfirmed at a meeting of councillors in Leeds on Wednesday when the deputy medical director of NHS England reaffirmed that all child heart surgery units in England, including Leeds, are safe to undertake surgery.’

The Save Our Surgery campaign group said Sir Roger’s involvement in deciding which child heart units should close means he is far from impartial.

His comments, added spokesman Sharon Cheng, were ‘extremely unhelpful and undermine the progress made over the last few days to begin to rebuild heart patients’ families’ trust and confidence’.

Greg Mulholland, Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds North West, called for Sir Roger to be sacked.He said the remarks had caused huge and unnecessary distress to families as well as slurring the  reputation of those working at the unit.

NHS medical director, Sir Bruce Keogh, took the decision to suspend treatment at the unit but said he now ‘disagreed’ with Sir Roger.

‘Having reviewed the unit, having reviewed the data, the performance in Leeds is in keeping with good national standards and I would be very happy to have my child operated upon in Leeds,’ said Sir Bruce.

Leeds General Infirmary is at the centre of a long-running row over the future of children's heart services at the hospital.

The NHS announced last July it wanted to close three units and keep seven open, the idea being to concentrate specialist services in fewer but larger centres that would give a higher quality of care for child heart patients.

Those currently chosen to stay open are at Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Newcastle, Southampton and two London centres.Facing closure are units at Leicester’s Glenfield Hospital, London’s Royal Brompton and the Leeds site.

This means patients in Yorkshire would be being forced to travel to Liverpool or Newcastle for treatment - a 150 or 200-mile round trip respectively.

There is huge support for keeping child heart surgery in the Yorkshire and nearly 600,000 people signed a petition against closure of the unit, organised by the group Save Our Surgery (SOS).

Last month, a High Court judge derailed plans to close the unit because of the ‘secretive’ approach of NHS chiefs.

Mrs Justice Davies backed claims by SOS that the consultation process to decide which units should be axed was unfair because details of how a panel of experts marked individual hospitals were kept secret.Last month, she ruled the decision was 'unfair and legally flawed'.

But within 24 hours, Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, had travelled to Leeds to suspend congenital heart surgery after data emerged suggesting it had a death rate twice the national average.

He said the figures were among a 'constellation of reasons' behind the suspension.
