A beach hut no bigger than a garden shed has gone on sale for £120,000 - and it can only be used in daylight hours.

The small hut overlooking the Isle of Sheppey comes with timber decking and a barbeque area on the freehold in Whitstable, Kent.

For £50 less, you can pick up a modern three-bedroom semi-detached home in Hartlepool, County Durham, with an en suite for the master bedroom.

Estate agents Christopher Hodgson advertise the sea-facing beach hut as being in an ‘enviable beachfront location’ enjoying views over Sheppey.

The hut has been fitted with a roll top work surface with storage beneath and a sink with a drainer unit below.

It has windows on three sides, overhead storage in the roof and its double doors open to a decked area leading to Whitstable beach.

And a paved terrace area with brick built barbecue over a tiled base is included in the freehold to the rear of the blue-painted hut.

Martin Gullett, of Christopher Hodgson estate agents, said: ‘We have had plenty of interest in it already.

‘There are dawn until dusk restrictions on it due to planning permission granted by the local authority.

‘It’s an appealing property to a range of people - from local people who live by the sea to someone who wants to use it at weekends.

‘There’s high demand for it and Whitstable is an expensive area - we have just sold a five bedroom house on the sea front for £2million.’

For those living in the capital who think they might want to pop down for the day, Whitstable railway station is a 73 minutes from London St Pancras.

A short stroll will also take you into the high street for local independent shops, a Post Office and restaurants specialising in seafood.
