Prince Andrew this week said foreign firms should invest in Britain, not other European nations, because 'unlike them it is open for business'

Prince Andrew has risked causing another political controversy by poking fun at EU nations plunged into chaos by the collapse of the euro.

The Duke of York told entrepreneurs at the Davos summit in Switzerland that foreign firms should invest in Britain, not other European nations, because ‘unlike them it is open for business’.

And he boasted it had another huge advantage – its own currency, not the ailing euro.

Fresh questions were being raised about the Prince's attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he is staying in a luxury ski chalet - at the expense of the taxpayer, it has emerged.

His controversial remarks were made at a private 
cocktail party at the conference, attended by international 
political and business leaders.

They
 came on the eve of tomorrow’s EU summit in Brussels, where Prime 
Minister David Cameron faces another bruising confrontation over his 
refusal to accept EU curbs on the City of London.

Chancellor
 George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson were also at the Davos 
reception, hosted by the Prince to promote British business, even though
 he is no longer a special envoy for UK Trade & Investment, the 
Government-backed body.

Prince
 Andrew was forced to quit the role last year following disclosures in 
The Mail on Sunday about his friendship with US billionaire Jeffrey 
Epstein, a convicted sex offender.

But
 he was allowed to maintain a lower-profile role and was guest of honour
 at its reception for British business leaders in Davos on Thursday.

According
 to witnesses, he said in his welcoming speech: ‘The message to get 
across here tonight is that Britain is open for business – unlike one or
 two other countries I could mention.’

To warm applause, he added: ‘And what is more, we have our own currency!’

One
 businessman said: ‘He knew he was chancing his arm a bit but most of us
 thought his comments were great. That is what he is there for, to bang 
the drum for Britain.

‘If any European takes umbrage at what he said, they lack a sense of humour.’

The
 Duke of York has made hundreds of trips to promote Britain. But his 
role was dogged by claims of lavish spending. A spokeswoman declined to 
comment.

Questions have been raised over 
Prince Andrew's role at the World Economic Forum, six months after he 
was forced to stand down at UK trade envoy over his friendship wit a 
convicted sex offender.

So 
far he has given a dinner for Indonesian businessmen, hosted a reception
 for UK trade delegates - including George Osborne - and held a 
one-to-one meeting with President Ilham Aliyev, the billionaire dictator
 of Azerbaijan.

This is despite him being forced to 
stand down as the UK's Special Representative for International Trade 
last July, amid controversy over his friendship with sex-offender 
Jeffrey Epstein and his close links with despots.

The 51-year-old Duke has been accompanied to the event by two publicly-funded aides and royal protection officers.

Yesterday, he was spotted going in 
skiing in nearby Klosters, where he is staying in a luxury, 
eight-bedroom chalet - accommodation which could up to £39,000.

The bill for the chalet - which 
features its own chef, chauffeur, sauna and steam room - could cost 
anything between £21,000 and £39,000, and it is expected to be paid for 
out of taxpayers' pockets.

The latest revelation about Prince Andrew has sparked outrage amongst his critics.

Shadow
 Justice Minister Chris Bryant told the Sunday Mirror: 'I thought we had
 dispensed with his services. There were plenty of UK representatives - 
David Cameron, George Osborne, Andrew Mitchell - who could have all met 
with Aliyev if it was in our national interests.

'At a time when everybody is feeling 
the pinch, it's shocking Prince Andrew still thinks he should be 
entitled to an eight-bedroom mansion.'

The Duke's meeting with President 
Aliyev only emerged through Azerbaihan state news agency, which released
 a picture of the pair together.

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace 
said Andrew had been invited to the World Economic Forum and was 
attending in his capacity as a senior member of the Royal family.

He 
also added that his meeting with President Aliyev was one of many 
official engagements planned during his visit.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'His role 
is to continue to support UK business and travel overseas as a senior 
member of the family, and visits which were already in the diary will be
 kept. He will relinquishing it gradually.'
