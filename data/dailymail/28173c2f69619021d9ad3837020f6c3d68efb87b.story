Prince William and Kate Middleton were at the centre of a safety scare tonight as it emerged a council is giving the public access to security plans for Kensington Palace.

Despite the local authority being asked to keep the documents secret, anyone can request access to them.

New security measures are being introduced at the Palace before the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge move into a new apartment late next year.

A former head of the Metropolitan Police
Royal Protection Squad said it was 'unbelievable' the plans were being 
put on public display.

The royal household are currently seeking planning permission to carry out the work.

The work includes fitting a dirty bomb proof air-lock double door to prevent intruders, rising bollards and a CCTV system.

Former Scotland Yard protection officer Dai Davies told the Evening Standard: 'I'm speechless that lessons have still not been learned by those responsible for their security. It beggars belief at the level of incompetence by those who purport to be experts in security.

'The problem you have got is not just terrorists, it's "fixated persons".

'There is a list at Scotland Yard of people who have an unhealthy interest in the royal family. You wouldn't want someone like that getting hold of it."

Roy Brown from the Buckingham Palace property department wrote to the council that they did not want the plans to be made available for the public to see.

'We would appreciate if this application could be treated as 
confidential and not be allowed to enter the public domain, owing to the
nature of the works and their location,' he said in a letter.

William and Kate already have a temporary home within the grounds of the residence where Princess Margaret used to live.

They will move into apartment 1A next year.

Anyone who wants to view the documents must request a meeting with officials at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council.

They will be required to produce a passport or driving licence before they see the documents at Kensington town hall and will not be allowed to make any copies.

A spokesman for council said: 'We have followed the rules and the documents have not been put on our website.

'Anyone who wants to see the documents will have to ring up in advance and arrange an appointment and must produce identification.

'They won't be allowed to make any copies and will be supervised at all times.

'It is being done so residents and other interested parties can see the proposals and comment on them in the usual way for an application.'

A spokesman for Buckingham Palace refused to comment tonight.
