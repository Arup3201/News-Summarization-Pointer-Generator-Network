A proposal to fire 'missiles' into the surface of Mars packed with probes rather than explosives is seeking $250,000 (£149,500) in funding.

The mission known as ExoLance is aiming to provide a cheap and simple way to find out what is underneath the surface of the red planet.

And the scientists hope their vessels will be taken by future spacecraft to Mars with a view to performing the deepest search for life on Mars yet.

A team of scientists from the non-profit group Explore Mars have come up with a proposal that they say could find life beneath the surface of the red planet. Called ExoLance, the mission would fire missiles at the surface and bury experiments underground

'Is there life on Mars? 'We don't know, but we do know that Mars has all the elements required for life,' the team writes on their Indiegogo page.

'Explore Mars, Inc. has a new mission concept designed to answer that question. 

'It is called ExoLance, and it is engineered to look below the surface of Mars for current microbial life.'

The proposal comes from the non-profit group Explore Mars based in Beverly, Massachusetts.

Amongst its team includes Dr Gilbert Levin, who previously led an experiment on one of Nasa’s 1976 Viking Mars landers that he was certain found evidence of life, although Nasa disagreed. 

Now he and the rest of the team are hoping to prove once and for all that the red planet is habitable with their ambitious proposal.

If funding is reached, the team hopes to build prototypes in 12 to 14 months and test them at a range in the New Mexico desert.

'Many areas of the Mojave Desert feature Mars-like characteristics,' they write.

'There, we will be able to test both the delivery system (from an aircraft) as well as the ground penetrating arrows.

'These tests will verify the average depth of penetration as well as testing the necessary parameters for a viable life detection experiment within the arrows.'

Once the concept has been sufficiently tested the team plans to approach Nasa and other space agencies and ask them to carry ExoLance on one or more future Mars missions.

Exolance would be carried to Mars by another spacecraft. The mission could comprise several penetrator probes, known as 'Arrows', that would be held in a 'Quiver' on the carrier vehicle, which would safely transport them through the atmosphere (artist's illustration shown)

Once through the atmosphere the lander carrying the Quiver would deploy its parachute and begin its gradual descent to the surface, at which point the Arrows would be released to various locations

The Arrows would bury initially to about 6.5 feet (two metres). Using a drill, however, they could bury to a total depth of 16.5 feet (five metres) where life detection equipment would be deployed

‘Exolance incorporates a delivery system that was originally designed for military purposes,’ the team writes on their website.

The mission would use a series of small lightweight penetrator probes called ‘Arrows’ that would take life detection equipment underground.

They would do this by impacting the surface at high speeds after being released from a carrier spacecraft.

A series of Arrows the company calls a ‘Quiver’ would be integrated into a lander and released as it makes its way to the surface.

Within each impactor would be experiments at the tip and communications equipment at the back so it could relay information to an orbiting spacecraft and then back to Earth.

The Arrows would also have a drilling capability allowing them to dig down to a total of 16.5ft (five metres).

Each missile, known as an Arrow, has a hardened penetrator on the front end and has a set of fins on the back end.

The middle of the probe is a cylinder that splits into two pieces when the arrow impacts the surface.

The first piece stays with the penetrator and burrows into the Martian surface to a depth of up to 6.5 feet (two metres)

This piece contains the life detection experiment in a small cylinder behind the penetrator.

This ‘metabolic test’ could distinguish between non-living chemistry and living microorganisms.

The team says if it detects life the experiment could determine if it is related to Earth life or is a new strain.

The second piece stays on the surface, where the fins act as stops to prevent it from going down into the hole.

This piece houses the radio equipment that sends the signals back to an orbiting relay on one of the existing Mars orbiters.

Once successfully deployed, the life detection experiment begins.

By deploying multiple probes, data sampling is expanded to multiple sites, which improves the science and reliability.

Having multiple probes allows for individual probe failures without losing the entire mission.

This
 concept borrows from several engineering designs already in practice. 
The penetrator design is based on military ‘bunker buster’ technology.

The split segments concept was pioneered by Nasa in the late 1990’s on the Deep Space 2 mission.

The team hopes to begin testing the concept in the Mojave Desert next year.

This location, they say, features Mars-like characteristics that will allow the concept to be tested to an adequate degree.

This will be phase 1 of the tests - phase 2 will be to test the microbial life detection experiments.

The
 team says that a number of upcoming Mars missions, including Nasa’s 
2016 Insight mission and Esa’s 2018 ExoMars mission, could carry 
Exolance.

Nasa's Curiosity rover (artist's illustration shown) is currently on Mars trying to ascertain if the red planet was or still is habitable. The Exolance team hope that their mission can be incorporated on a future Mars mission such as Nasa's Insight in 2016 or Esa's Exomars in 2018.
