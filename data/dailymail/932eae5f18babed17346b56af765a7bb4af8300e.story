Musician will.i.am adds a new string to his already overloaded bow with the launch of his new eyewear, humorously named ill.i Optics. But luckily the collection is not only for those with ill eyes and includes funky shades for those with 20:20 vision, too.

'I see a gap in the world of eyewear and this is my installment of what I feel is missing. I want this to be an honest brand - it's about dedication and passion,' says the star, who has worn and collected glasses for 20 years.

The musician, who describes himself as an 'eyewear connoisseur', says the range, which includes men’s, women’s and unisex styles, is inspired by the hip hop pioneers and graffiti characters of the Eighties, as well as by his own personal collection.

The first collection consists of 12 different sun shades and optical glasses in many different colourways – the palette includes gold, tortoiseshell, gunmetal, black, silver, grey, white, burgundy and red and the pieces come in different finishes and unique material combinations.

The eyewear is a collaboration with Australian designer George Gorrow, best known as co-founder of fashion label ksubi. All pieces were designed in LA but handmade in Italy.

The 
campaign film and images, shot in LA, give an exclusive glimpse into 
will.i.am’s carefully curated personal collection spanning over twenty 
years.

And
 of course there's a dedicated soundtrack on the video, created by the 
man himself, which he says 'captures the mood' of the collection.

The ill.i Optics website (ill.i.am), which went 
live yesterday, sheds further light on the new label's style: 'The 
collection pays homage to the evolution of eyewear; drawing inspiration 
from rare vintage shapes – twisted and reworked to create something new 
and fresh, progressive and timeless.'

So how much will a pair of ill.i shades, available at a handful of exclusive stockists, set you back? For sunglasses, prices start at £180 and for optical frames, £170.

But if you can't find your perfect pair, hold tight. More ill.i shapes will be dropping early next year.
