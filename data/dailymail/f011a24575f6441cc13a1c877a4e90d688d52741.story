Max Schrems, an Austrian law student, wants compensation from Facebook for alleged breaches in privacy

An Austrian court will consider a class action against Facebook by 25,000 people who are claiming their privacy has been breached.

The David v Goliath case is being spearheaded by law student Max Schrems, who wants Mark Zuckerberg’s social media site to compensate him and his supporters with a symbolic £400 each.

A hearing in Vienna on April 9 will consider whether the lawsuit is admissible.

Mr Schrems began his legal challenge last June, claiming that Facebook supplied personal information to the US Prism spy programme.

Over the next few months 25,000 people added their names to the lawsuit.

The programme is the U.S. secret service's worldwide monitoring and data mining system and was exposed by whistleblower Edward Snowden last year.

Mr Schrems said that the court in the Austrian capital would have the power to make a judgment in the absence of a counter-statement from the social network.

Mr Schrems is claiming damages of £397 (€500) per supporter, meaning that if the case was expanded and the activists won, Facebook would have to pay out a total of £23.8m.

As it stands, the company could still have to pay more than £9.9m if they lose the case.

The action is being taken against the Irish subsidiary of the New York-listed web giant.

The class action claims Facebook Ireland is in breach of European law on users' data and it violates rights by tracking internet use on external sites, including the use of 'like' buttons.

Facebook has more than 1.3 billion users and is worth around £118bn on the stock market.

Founder Mark Zuckerberg has previously denied any link between Prism and his company.

Facebook told MailOnline it had no comment to make on the case.

On Monday Facebook and Instagram were down worldwide for around an hour after an alleged cyber attack.

The online group Lizard Squad have claimed responsibility for the hack, which took the two social media sites down at around 6am GMT. 

Both sites, which have a total of 1.5billion users, appeared with error messages in the United States, Europe and Asia for around an hour.

But despite hackers claiming they took the social media giants offline, Zuckerberg's Facebook, which also owns Instagram, refused to say what the fault was.

There were claims online that the super-snowstorm that is over America's east coast may have knocked out its servers.

The allegations centre around three main concerns including:

Facebook's Graph Search - this feature lets users discover information about other member's likes and activities.

External website tracking - Facebook monitors Likes on other sites through embedded buttons.

Big data analysis - the social network analyses interactions to learn about member behaviours.

Graph Search was launched in July 2013 and appears as a bigger search bar at the top of each page.

It lets users find people who like cycling in London, for example, or which 18-year-olds in San Francisco are interested in horror films.

When a user searches for something, that search not only determines the set of results they get, but also serves as a title for the page.

Graph search uses the same privacy settings as a user's normal profile.
