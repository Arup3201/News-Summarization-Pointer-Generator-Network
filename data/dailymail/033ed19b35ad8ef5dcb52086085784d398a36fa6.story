Andy Murray is all but qualified for next month’s season-end finale in London, dredging up another supreme effort on Sunday to almost cement his place in the illustrious eight-man field.

The 27 year-old Scot, who at the US Open expressed indifference about ‘overplaying’ to fight his way to the O2 Arena, strained every sinew in saving five match points and win the Valencia Open with a 3-6, 7-6, 7-6, victory over world No 16 Tommy Robredo.

The Spaniard jokingly gave him a two fingered salute as they collapsed upon each other at the net after another epic battle. Last month Murray also saved five match points against him in the Shenzen Open final, which was to kick off a remarkable five-week run that will carry him all the way to the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals.

Andy Murray can seal qualification for the ATP World Tour Finals by reaching the quarter-finals of this week's Paris Masters.

Even if he was to lose his opening match, all of the following would have to happen for him to miss out on the season-ending finale in London:

Murray will drag his battered frame to the Paris Masters this week but the hard work is surely done with this third title in 31 days, which has seen him win 17 out of 19 matches and revive a year that had fallen short of his usual standards.

At Flushing Meadows he pledged not to overdo it in trying to make the prestigious London event which offers huge ranking points and prize money, but has had a strange way of showing it ever since.

The result has been a surge up to the fifth qualifying place, and even if he was to lose his opening match in Paris – where he has a bye into the second round - there would need to be an extraordinary confluence of results to keep him out.

The arithmetic is infernal, but it will take stellar Paris performances from Tomas Berdych, David Ferrer, Milos Raonic and Grigor Dimitrov to pull off the mathematical miracle required.

Murray missed the whole of the late season twelve months ago after undergoing back surgery and had not won a tournament prior to China but it is now possible he will end the season back in the top four.

The question is how much he will have left in the tank for the last two significant events of the year after pulling himself around Asia and then making unscheduled entries into Vienna and Valencia, which he won as part of a nine-match winning streak.

Above him the wider intrigue will surround Roger Federer and his attempts to join Serena Williams – who beat Simona Halep to win the WTA year-end finale in Singapore on Sunday – as the season’s official number one player at the ripe old age of 33.

Federer, who won the ATP event in Basle on Sunday by beating David Goffin 6-2 6-2, will be tired but not as much as Murray, who is now due to compete for his sixth week in succession.

One of the last players you would wish to meet under the circumstances is Robredo, who is like his fellow Spanish 32 year-old Ferrer in having remarkable stamina to cover enormous mileage.

Murray has beaten them both in his three recent finals and needed to overcome them both this weekend, and it was amazing his legs could take the strain.

At times in the three hour and 20 minute final he looked on the verge of keeling over and lost his temper several times, with even the indefatigable Robredo showing signs of cramping as they went down the stretch again.

While Murray’s fighting spirit will be the abiding memory of one of the tennis year’s best contests the fact is that he could have wrapped it up in straight sets. He was a little tentative on his six break points in the first set and should have gone a double break up for 5-2 in the second.

Robredo had two match points before Murray came through 9-7 in the subsequent tiebreak. In the second tiebreak Robredo got to 6-5 and pushed Murray way into the corner, but he somehow managed to keep the rally going to stay alive before saving two more, and then reeling off three winning combinations from 7-8 down.

That brings 500 points – double the haul from Shenzhen or Vienna – and it should mean the home crowd will get to see this remarkable competitor by the Thames early next month.

It was a heartbreaking defeat for Spaniard Tommy Robredo who failed to capitalise on five match points against Andy Murray in front of his home fans.

It was the second time in a month that the British No 1 saved five match points against Robredo, the last time being in the final of the Shenzhen Open on September 28.

And this time a shattered Robredo reacted with a light-hearted double middle finger salute.
