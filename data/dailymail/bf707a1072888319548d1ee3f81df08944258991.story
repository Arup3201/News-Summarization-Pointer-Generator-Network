Jenna Bush may not have lived in the White House full-time when her father was in office, but she did take advantage of it while she was there.

Last night, the former First Daughter, now 33 and married to Henry Hager, admitted to Andy Cohen that she may have engaged in 'a little hanky panky' on the roof when she was younger.

The mother-of-one implied that the man she kissed that night was Henry himself, who was in the audience as she spoke on the show.

Confession: Former First Daughter Jenna Bush Hager, now 33 and married to Henry Hager, has admitted that she may have engaged in 'a little hanky panky' on the White House roof when she was 19

Playing innocent: At first, Jenna remained coy when she was asked if she had ever fooled around in the White House, telling the audience: 'Am I blushing? Listen, a lady never talks!'

Tell-all: Andy also asked if she ever romped around in the Lincoln bedroom. 'No, no,' she said, before conceding jokingly: 'Maybe I missed an opportunity there'

At first, Jenna remained coy when she was asked if she had ever fooled around in the White House, telling the audience: 'Am I blushing? Listen, a lady never talks!'

But eventually, she confessed: 'Maybe there was a little kiss on the roof.' 

Jenna implied that the lucky man on that fateful night was her husband-to-be, explaining: 'I was 19 years old when my dad became president... meaning I knew [my husband] for a long time.

'And you know, maybe there was a little hanky panky. There was maybe a kiss on the roof,' she revealed with a sly smile.

The Today show correspondent, who met her husband during father George W Bush's 2004 campaign, was also asked if she ever romped around in the Lincoln bedroom.

'No, no,' she said, before conceding jokingly: 'Maybe I missed an opportunity there.'

All grown up: These days, she is happily married to Henry Hager, with whom she has a one-year-old daughter named Mila

Jenna, who welcomed daughter Mila in April 2013, also talked about being 'fiercely protective' of Malia and Sasha Obama, who were recently criticized by a GOP aide for not showing enough 'class'.

'It's not easy, and it's not a job that they wanted. And so it's hard!' said Jenna.

'I mean I, obviously, heh, had a hard time. But it's also a privilege. So I mean... they've done an incredible job.'
