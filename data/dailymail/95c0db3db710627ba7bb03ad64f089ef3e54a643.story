Chancellor Angela Merkel has shrugged aside a book that suggests she may have been closer to East Germany's communist system than previously thought, saying she's never hidden anything.

The 58-year-old Merkel grew up in East Germany and entered politics as communism crumbled in 1989. It's long been known that, like many, she joined the communist youth organization. She has said she 'politically lived an assimilated life'

A book appearing this week revives questions about whether Merkel was a propaganda secretary for the youth organization, which she denies, and says she was an active labor union official.

Comrade Angela: Angela Merkel, 58, grew up in East Germany and entered politics as communism crumbled in 1989 and it's long been known that, like many, she joined the communist youth organization

Merkel said at an event late on Sunday that she had never hidden anything about her life in East Germany, though acknowledged some things may emerge 'because no one has ever asked me about them.'

Indeed, in 2010, she admitted to a German magazine that she still does her laundry with an East German liquid detergent, prepares East German Soljanka soup - made with sausages and pickle juice - and can't fight the urge to stockpile at the supermarket.

'Sometimes I can't stop myself from buying things just because I see them - even when I don't really need them,' Merkel told SuperIllu ahead of celebrations for the 20th anniversary of unification.

'This inclination to hoard is deeply ingrained in me, because in the past, in times of scarcity, you took what you could get,' Merkel said, referring to life under communism.

Germany was divided into communist East Germany and capitalist West Germany following the defeat of the Nazis in World War II. The eastern German Democratic Republic formally joined the western Federal Republic of Germany on Oct. 3, 1990, after months of peaceful protests brought down the East German system.

A night to remember: Berliners from the east and west celebrate on November 11 1989 - the day the Berlin Wall was knocked down, bringing an end to Communism in Germany

Great divide: Youngsters take a peek over the wall into east Germany in 1989, left, and East German guards watch as West Germans bring down parts of the wall in the same year

Fall of the wall: But while boundaries have blurred over time, many 'Ossis' and 'Wessis' - the nicknames for those born and raised in the east and west - still seem to stick to old mindsets and keep to themselves

But while boundaries have blurred over time, many 'Ossis' and 'Wessis' - the nicknames for those born and raised in the east and west - still seem to stick to old mindsets and keep to themselves.

Ossis are considered more insular, cherishing the few East German products that have survived the unification - like Rotkaeppchen sparkling wine or Spreewald pickles - and taking holidays at their Russian-style dachas in the countryside.

West Germans, on the other hand, are seen as more outward-looking, gravitating toward new trends in music, art or literature.

Despite all the efforts to adjust the standard of living, East Germans are still underrepresented in many parts of society.
