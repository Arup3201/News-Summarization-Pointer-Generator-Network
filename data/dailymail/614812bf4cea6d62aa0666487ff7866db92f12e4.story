Lewis Hamilton drove immaculately through the gloom of Shanghai to become the most successful one-lap Briton in history, ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix.

The Mercedes man's third pole position in four races took him to 34 in total, eclipsing the legendary Jim Clark, and into the top four on the all-time list, behind Michael Schumacher, Ayrton Senna and Sebastian Vettel.

Hamilton's qualifying brilliance in 
unremitting drizzle meant he finished more than half a second in front 
of Daniel Ricciardo and over a second ahead of Vettel, the Red Bull pair
 who will start second and third.

'It's great to be up there with the great names,' said Hamilton. 'I'm very proud of that, but it's only qualifying.'

Only
 qualifying, yes, but the pole position had added piquancy because of 
the simmering tensions between the Mercedes and Red Bull teams.

Before qualifying Niki Lauda, Mercedes' F1 chairman, took a cake he 
had brought from Vienna into the Red Bull hospitality area as a peace 
offering, after his team mounted an aggressive campaign to have them 
banned from this and the next three races for a fuel irregularity in 
Australia last month.

But 
Helmut Marko, Red Bull's motor racing consultant, threw the delicacy 
away. He instead joked that Lauda should wear a bullet-proof vest if he 
ever came back to their paddock home.

Lauda was made aware of Red Bull's dismay when they contacted him 
directly after seeing the 95-page dossier Mercedes submitted to the FIA 
court of appeal hearing, which sat last Monday.

The judges found against Red Bull and ordered them to pay the costs but rejected Mercedes' call for a harsher punishment.

Fourth: Nico Rosberg was unable to mount a serious challenge when he spun on the final lap

Second fiddle: The German had to settle for another qualifying session behind his team-mate

Hamilton's
 team-mate Nico Rosberg was fourth fastest after a lock-up on his 
penultimate lap and then, pushing hard, spun on the last corner of his 
final lap.

That means Hamilton is well-placed to supplant Rosberg in the drivers' standings from 11 points behind.

Red
 Bull's resurgence after a torrid few months is testament to the 
strength of their team. The aerodynamic qualities of their RB10 afforded
 plenty of grip in the wet conditions.

Sadly for them, rain is not forecast for Sunday.
