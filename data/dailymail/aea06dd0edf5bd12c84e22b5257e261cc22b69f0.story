U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice has warned that the fight against the Islamic State will be a 'long-term effort' - and one in which  Iraq must take the lead.

Speaking on NBC's 'Meet The Press', the 49-year-old said that ground troops will be a part of the campaign to combat the terror group, which has seized swathes of both Iraq and Syria.

But she repeated administration pledges that they will be Iraqi forces - not American - saying: 'It's got to be the Iraqis. This is their fight. This is their territory.'

She added: 'When we had over 100,000 U.S. troops in Iraq, it still came down to whether the Iraqis were willing and able to fight for their own country.'

Instead, Rice said that America would continue to 'do what we can from the air' to support the Iraqi and Kurdish security forces in their fight to 'degrade and destroy' ISIS, also known as ISIL and IS.

So far, the U.S.-led coalition has carried out more than 430 airstrikes on the militant group, which is currently approaching Baghdad, according to the U.S. Central Command.

But Rice warned that we should not under-estimate the lengthy nature of the fight, saying: 'We are in the early stages of what is going to be, as President Obama has said, a long-term effort.'

President: She also warned that we should not under-estimate the lengthy nature of the fight, saying: 'We are in the early stages of what is going to be, as President Obama (pictured) has said, a long-term effort'

During the conversation with Chuck Todd, Rice also said she hoped the new Iraqi government would rebuild the county's armed forces, which 'atrophied' under the rule of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.

Although this task 'is not going to be easy' and 'there is a long way to go', it would enable Iraq to battle ISIS on its own and take back territory from militants, she said. 

She added that the U.S. is not coordinating its military efforts with Iran, which has fallen into dispute with Washington over its nuclear program. The two countries are working 'very differently', she said.

The U.S. military said yesterday it launched airstrikes north and west of Baghdad, hitting a small ISIS fighting unit and destroying armed vehicles. It said Britain participated in the airstrikes.

New York-based Human Rights Watch meanwhile said militants from ISIS are holding hundreds of Yazidi captives, including women and children, in detention facilities in Iraq and Syria.

Based on accounts by relatives of detainees, it said the group has systematically separated young women and teenage girls from their families and has forced some of them to marry its fighters.

Hundreds of people from the Yazidi religious minority were killed and tens of thousands were forced to flee for their lives after militants overran their hometown of Sinjar in north-west Iraq in August.

Also today, activists claimed Kurdish fighters have halted ISIS’s advance in the Syrian border town of Kobani, where the U.S.-led coalition has been carrying out airstrikes for two weeks.

The Syrian Kurdish enclave has been the scene of heavy fighting since last month, with the heavily armed ISIS fighters trying to capture the border post and deal a blow to the coalition air campaign.

The extremist group has carved out a vast stretch of territory stretching hundreds of miles from northern Syria to the outskirts of Baghdad and imposed a harsh version of Islamic rule.

The fighters have massacred hundreds of captured Iraqi and Syrian soldiers, terrorised religious minorities, and beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers.

Since the offensive on Kobani began, 550 people have been killed, including about 300 ISIS fighters, 225 Kurdish gunmen and 20 civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

During today's NBC show, Rice also referred to the Ebola outbreak that has claimed the lives of more than 4,000 people across the world, mostly in the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea.

She said other countries 'haven't done enough to help', adding: 'This is going to take all hands on deck, because the goal has to be to contain this epidemic in the three countries that we've seen in West Africa to try to prevent its spread and to provide the appropriate care to those that need it.'

And in relation to the absence of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Rice said the administration has not seen any indications of a transfer of power at present.
