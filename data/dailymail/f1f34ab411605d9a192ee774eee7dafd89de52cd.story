Family birthdays at my French in-laws' rambling farmhouse are mandatory but lively affairs, with anything from 20 to 25 noisy personalities gathered under one roof.

Every time I travel to a celebration with my husband to meet his sisters and brother, and their respective families, it is with some apprehension. They are daunting.

From the off, I found these reunions terrifying. But as time passed, and Pascal and I clocked up five years of marriage, I hoped my place as the second wife of my in-laws' eldest child was finally, firmly, established.

Second best? Samantha fears she can't live up to Pascal's first wife Eleanor

So I was astonished by events at a recent birthday lunch. We were sitting round the table when my father-in-law poured himself another generous glass of Malbec then asked: 'Can you pass the cheese, Eleanor?' 

The uncomfortable silence was palpable. Everyone knows 'Eleanor' is not my name. It is the name of Pascal's first wife. An embarrassed titter erupted from a guest and my sister-in-law, Manuelle, gave my hand a reassuring squeeze under the table. My cheeks burned.

Pascal swiftly came to the rescue. He broke the pregnant silence by asking if anyone wanted more wine.

I have known Pascal and his family for more than six years. It pains me to admit it, but such blunders - and they have happened more than once - still leave me feeling bewildered and distressed.

Perhaps I should be more generous to Pascal's father, who is in his early 70s and can be forgetful. But I'm at his house regularly: I help him with DIY, bring gifts and take him out to lunch, so the very least he can do, surely, is remember my name.

Mine is not the name which passes my in-laws' lips the most, it is Eleanor's. At that birthday lunch, she was again, the spectre at the table, worming her way into a family gathering at which she had no place.

Daphne du Maurier’s novel Rebecca - in which the unnamed heroine lives her life in the shadow of her husband's eponymous first bride - celebrates its 75th anniversary this year. It is a book I love but which has always haunted me. And today, the echo of the oh-so perfect first wife has shifted from powerful fiction to troubling fact.

Today I am in the shadow of my very own Rebecca: I live, day-in, day-out, with my husband's ex. 

Baby quest: Samantha longs to give her husband children like his first wife did

Du Maurier's son Kits Browning has revealed the novel was based on his mother's jealousy of her husband's first wife. She, like me, recognised that the ghost of the first wife can never be exorcised.

When I first came across pictures of Pascal and Eleanor together, my heart plummeted. Flicking through album after photo album, I began to compare her relationship with Pascal to mine. They were married for eight years. How could I possibly compete, I wondered.

As I flicked through, they went from loved-up boyfriend and girlfriend to happily married couple, before becoming the proud parents of a daughter, and then a son - Joëlle, 29, and Hélios, 26. To my envious eyes, they seemed the perfect family.

Perhaps the biggest blow to my ego was that it was obvious they were each other's first love. I have never dared delve too far into the reasons why she and Pascal split, but they got together when young, and it seems, simply grew apart.

'While I'm in no doubt I am the love of 
his life, he is reluctant to take his family to task over Eleanor, and 
her seemingly privileged status'

It would make my life infinitely more bearable if Eleanor was fat, frumpy and past her prime, but she isn't. Even though she is 15 years older than me, Eleanor - who is also British - is blonde, beautiful and intelligent.

It is even more galling that she was a professional sportswoman, excelling at badminton, and is now a professor of English.

The perfect Eleanor has imposed herself with frustrating regularity - even on my wedding day.

My stepdaughter mentioned her mother had wanted to send a card. I balked at this. Joëlle explained, awkwardly, that Eleanor had wanted to write 'Good Luck' inside - as she thought I would need it.

Why would this woman feel the need to poke her nose in, 20 years after Pascal had left her?

She has also guarded her friendship with my husband's sister, Veronique, staying in such close contact with her that I could never hope to form my own bond.

What does Pascal have to say about it? Very little. While I'm in no doubt I am the love of his life, he is reluctant to take his family to task over Eleanor, and her seemingly privileged status.

How does this make me feel? Disappointed and, on occasion, very nearly murderous. 

Art imitating life: Daphne du Maurier's son said her novel Rebecca was based on her jealousy of her husband's first wife

In 2009, without our say-so, she joined us with Pascal's family on a weekend break.

My in-laws take a summer holiday together every year, and it's a tradition for the children to meet up with them for a long weekend. Imagine my horror when, two years into my marriage, Pascal and I arrived to discover his first wife was there too.

At first, I had no idea who she was. My legs almost buckled when she bounded over, introduced herself and kissed Pascal on the cheek. It was mortifying.

Needless to say, it's a day I would rather forget. Not only did Eleanor insist on taking constant photographs of Pascal and I, she also dominated the conversation at the dining table. She sat next to me - speaking perfect French, which at the time I couldn't do - but interrogated me in English, goading me about why I'd given up being a vegetarian.

'I look to the future, to weddings, 
christenings and grandchildren, and shrink with misery when I think how 
Eleanor will dominate them'

A heavy silence hung between Pascal and myself on the journey home, and it took until the next day for me to pluck up the courage to ask if he had known beforehand Eleanor would be there. He said he'd known nothing about it, and we later found my in-laws did not tell us, because they knew we would not have gone.

So the next year, I told Pascal that if 'she' was going on the family holiday, I wasn't. For once, he took a stand and told his parents we would not be going and why.

The fall-out was ugly. There were many heated telephone discussions between Pascal and his parents, and since then the family holiday has been dropped. But it's not Eleanor’s looks, her French or even her equanimity with my in-laws which really irritates me.

Eleanor has something I will never have. She gave birth to, and raised his children. And it's becoming increasingly clear to me, midway through yet more IVF, that I will never achieve the same.

Pascal and I have been trying, unsuccessfully, to have a family of our own for the past five years. My stepchildren, though lovely, are the product of their marriage. They mean my husband's life will forever be entwined with his ex-wife's.

No escape: Samantha hates the fact Eleanor will always be in her life as the mother of Pascal's children

I look to the future, to weddings, christenings and grandchildren, and shrink with misery when I think how Eleanor will dominate them. Sadly, I have no alternative but to avoid them.

Today, I am constantly reminded of Eleanor's status as 'mother' and 'first wife' whenever my stepchildren come to stay. She sends cards and presents which the children must hand over to their grandparents in front of me. 

These days, Joëlle rarely discusses her mother in front of me.

I have left the table more than once when this conversation comes up. While Pascal sympathises, he tries to keep the peace. I sometimes ask how he would feel if my parents discussed my ex-husband in his company.

Pascal's response is logical, but cuts me to the quick. 'Why would they talk about your ex?' he asks. 'You don't have children so there's no reason for him to continue to play any part in your life.

And so, my IVF battle continues, while the fragrant, fecund Eleanor wafts around my family.

Veronique, pointedly asks how things are going on 'that front' whenever we meet. I do not doubt my answers are always faithfully reported back to Eleanor.

I can't help but feel Veronique disapproves. When she gave my husband a 'friendly' warning of how difficult the IVF process is, I had to wonder whether these were Veronique's true feelings, or whether she was parroting something Eleanor had said to her.

Slowly, I have come to realise that the spectre of my husband's oh-so perfect first wife will not go away. I may resent and regret that fact, but I know she will be in my marriage for the rest of my life. I only hope we can survive her presence.
