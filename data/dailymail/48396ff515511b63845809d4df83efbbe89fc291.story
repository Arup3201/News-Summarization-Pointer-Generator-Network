Experiencing Oculus Rift for the first time can be an amazing experience for new users.

But for one dad the experience was even better than he imagined when his son took him on a virtual rollercoaster ride.

He whoops with delight with his arms raised for most of the ride as the headset takes him on a track around a virtual house.

A son has filmed his dad riding an Oculus Rift rollercoaster (screen grab shown), with his dad seemingly thrilled by the experience as he's taken round a track. In the video he's shown whooping and cheering throughout the ride. It highlights how unique the headset can be for people who are trying it for the first time

The video was made by Austin Hooper on YouTube channel Hoopernation.

His dad seems a little skeptical at first but after the first drop - which makes your stomach jump even without a headset - he quickly begins to enjoy himself.

Halfway through he’s in for another surprise, when a virtual cannon launches him up a steep incline on the track.

Oculus VR was founded by 21-year-old college dropout Palmer Luckey.

It is designed to provide users with an immersive virtual reality experience not only for conventional video games, but for other activities as well.

Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their £1.2bn ($2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved.

It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg.

A commercial version is rumoured to launch in 2015.

The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year. 

‘Oh my god, oh my god,' the dad explains as the rollercoaster plummets into a dive at the start.

The dad then whoops and hollers as the track twists and turns, taking him under a sofa at one point and then to a launcher, which fires him up the side of the room. 

And the dad is then tilted sideways as the rollercoaster spins round, before returning back to the start. 

‘So, since the reason as to why I got this thing was thanks to my dad, I was more than willing to let him try it out,’ Hooper writes on YouTube.

He adds: ‘Me and my dad are absolutely blown away by all the people that liked the video.’

‘According to him, you've all made him a “YouTube idiot”.’ 

Virtual reality headsets, such as Oculus Rift, allow gamers to use a pair of hi-tech ‘goggles’ with a screen instead of glass to play video games.

While they are currently only available for developers, commercial virtual reality headsets are expected to launch next year.

A set of lenses on the screen focuses and reshapes an image for each eye, which creates a 3D image.

This image matches a wearer’s movements and makes it seem as if they have stepped into the realistic world they are seeing in front of them - with 360° views.

Oculus, which has now been acquired by Facebook, has been fine tuning its technology for years and a commercial version of its headset is tipped to launch next year.
