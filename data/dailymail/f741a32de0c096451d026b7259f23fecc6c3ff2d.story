Clutching flaming bundles of straw these Nepalese revellers were praying their torches would light the way to a bumper harvest as they celebrated a traditional festival.

The excited men and women were marking the final day of the Rato Machindranath chariot festival, also known as Bhoto Jatra, in Bungamati, on the outskirts of Kathmandu.

While many people in the UK spend their summers wishing for good weather, in Nepal it is quite the opposite as the festival is held every year in the hope of bringing on the monsoon rains.

Fired up: The event is celebrated every year to herald good monsoon rains for increased rice harvest, prosperity and good luck

Monsoon weather will bring with it an increased rice harvest, prosperity and good luck.

The rain festival is one of the Asian country's major events, and is observed by both the Buddhist and Hindu communities of the country's capital, Kathmandu.

During the month-long celebration devotees ask the rain god, Rato Machindranath, for rainfall to prevent drought during the rice harvest season.

The revelries start every year in Pulchock when locals build a huge chariot, containing a carved image of the rain god, and commemorates an ancient legend in which a king named Narendra Dev brought an idol of Rato Machindranath from India to Nepal to help ease a drought.

The chariot is then pulled around Kathmandu for a month when the celebrations come to a climax with a government official displaying a jewel-studded black vest from the chariot so onlookers can catch a glimpse of it.

The spectacle is a re-enactment of another legend in which a farmer lost a special vest he had been given as a gift from the serpent god Karkotaka Naga.

One day, the farmer had come to watch the chariot pulling festival when he saw someone wearing his missing garment.

A quarrel ensued, and it was agreed that the vest would be kept with the chariot until the rightful owner was able to prove it had been theirs.

Since then, the vest has been shown to the public annually as a call to potential claimants to step forward.
