Four friends are living the adrenaline-rush dream - getting paid to go base jumping and skydiving.

Daredevils Marshall Miller, Neil Amonson, Jesse Hall and Jt Holmes are the GoPro Bomb Squad.

The group have travelled the world over the last five years, showcasing their talents in disciplines as diverse as paragliding, speed flying, wingsuit cloud surfing, base jumping, and skydiving.

Their stunts have included dangling from the bottom of a helicopter thousands of feet in the air and base jumping from bridges.  

'When you’re dangling from bottom of a helicopter, it’s a pretty amazing feeling, you feel like you shouldn’t be there. Usually the helicopter pilot doesn’t want you to do it but we assure them that it’s fine,' Marshall said.

'It’s actually really scary to climb down on to the skid, so we really like to take people for their first time and watch their face as they do it. If it was a jungle gym it would be really easy to do, but when you’re thousands of metres in the air, it’s a little unnerving!'

The full-time thrill-seekers formed the Bomb Squad in 2008 after approaching portable action camera maker GoPro for sponsorship in the hope of turning their extreme sports holidays into a paying job.

'We were all really good friends and jumped together anyway and travelled together,' Marshall said.  

'One day we were in Switzerland, staying in a little chalet cabin. We were paying for the trips on our own and two of us started talking and saying "wouldn’t it be cool if we could somehow do this for a living?" 

'We thought it would be a good idea to approach GoPro and ask them if they wanted to sponsor us – that we would jump at their events. They said yes and each year we have worked with GoPro our relationship has grown and grown.'

But the father-of-two, who lives in Alpine, Utah, with wife Nicole, was happy to give up property deals to pursue a life of high-altitude high-jinx.

While the Bomb Squad are all high-performance athletes at the peak of their game, Marshall acknowledges that there is a real element of danger involved when the margin for error is so tiny.

'To fly a wingsuit along the ground for 30 seconds to a minute in the Alps, that’s really scary, but that the stuff I really like,' he said.

'There’s ways to control it for sure, but it’s definitely like you’re on the edge where any mistake you make you don’t don’t just crash, unfortunately you die.

'The other guys are all single, but I have a family, so I’m very aware of the safety aspect of it. This stuff’s really amazing and all,  but I definitely don’t want to die doing it!'

Marshall's first experience with a parachute was a base jump off a 500ft tall bridge close to his home, with his wife standing by to film the event and offer moral support.

'I climbed over the rails and my wife
 was saying "Are you sure you know what you’re doing?" but it all worked
 out fine,' Marshall sad. 'I’m not sure if she was more scared or I 
was.'

Growing up with 
legendary rock climber Kim Miller as a father, it's perhaps unsurprising
 that Marshall feels comfortable with risk, although the parachute 
fanatic admits he also practices yoga every day as a calming contrast to
 his death-defying leaps.

And
 although the Bomb Squad boys have made thousands of jumps between them,
 you sense this is one job it's not ever going to be hard to get out of 
bed in the morning for.

'I’ve had over 10,000 flights in my life, and at least 1,600 jumps,' Marshall added. 'It’s very, very exciting still.

'Every time I go do a demo jump, I have to pinch myself just to remind me that this is really what I do for a job. Every time I walk up to the helicopter I get this feeling of "Okay, here we go, this is going to be awesome!"' 

'Can't believe it': Mr Miller says he has to pinch himself to remind him this is what he gets paid to do
