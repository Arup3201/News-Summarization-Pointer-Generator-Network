A runner who was just half a mile from completing the Boston Marathon when a bomb detonated has spoken of the simple but overwhelming kindness of strangers amid the scenes of devastation. 

Runner Laura Wellington was told 'You are a finisher in my eyes' as she was comforted by another athlete who handed her the medal from around his own neck.

She had been nearing the finish line of the 26 mile race when the explosion happened, killing three people and injuring 183.  Her first thought, she said, was not for her own safety but for that of her family who were waiting for her at the finish line.

She has told how she was given the medal from around another runner's neck as he comforted her by the roadside

After several frantic attempts, she finally made contact and discovered all were safe.

As she sank to the floor, weeping and weak with relief, the fellow runner stopped to comfort her.

She described the moment she sat on a pavement, scattered with bomb debris, in a Facebook post which has now been shared by more than 88,690 people.

She said: 'At that moment, a couple walking by stopped. The woman took the space tent off her husband, who had finished the marathon, and wrapped it around me.

'She asked me if I was okay, if I knew where my family was. I reassured her I knew where they were and I would be OK.

'The man then asked me if I finished to which I nodded "no." He then proceeded to take the medal off from around his neck and placed it around mine.

'He told me "you are a finisher in my eyes." I was barely able to choke out a "thank you" between my tears.'

Three people were killed and more than 170 injured when two bombs exploded near the finish line of Monday's race

The scenes of devastation left after the attack. Those who died were an eight-year-old boy, a woman, 29 and a postgraduate student from China

'Odds are I will never see this couple again, but I'm reaching out with the slim chance that I will be able to express to them just what this gesture meant to me. I was so in need of a familiar face at that point in time.

'This couple reassured me that even though such a terrible thing had happened, everything was going to be OK.'

Three people were killed and more than 170 injured when two bombs exploded near the finish line of Monday's race.

Those who died were an eight-year-old boy, a woman, 29 and a postgraduate student from China.

Vigils for the victims were held across the city on Tuesday night.

Images released by a joint Homeland Security and FBI bulletin have revealed the bombs may have been packed in pressure cookers.

The pictures show the remains of a dark backpack, a detonation device and mangled pieces of metal.
