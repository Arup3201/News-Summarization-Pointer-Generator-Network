The author of The Snowden Files, the book that claims to tell the inside story of Edward Snowden's NSA leaks, has revealed some of the very odd things that happened while he was writing it.

Writing in the Guardian, Luke Harding tells eye-opening tales of possible spooks, surveillance, strange meetings and suspicion.

Yet the weirdest experience that Harding relates is when his work-in-progress began to self-delete, with the words disappearing before his eyes. He still doesn't know what, or who, was responsible.

The journalist explained that the alarming incident happened on his own computer at his family home in England in September last year.

It happened after it seemed his laptop could have been tampered with and he met a American who he believed was a CIA spy in Brazil.

Harding was writing a chapter on the links between the NSA and Silicon Valley.

Then, as he explains in the Guardian article: 'Something odd happened. The paragraph I had just written began to self-delete.

'The cursor moved rapidly from the left, 
gobbling text. I watched my words vanish. When I tried to close my 
OpenOffice file the keyboard began flashing and bleeping,' he wrote.

Harding writes that similar incidents occurred over the next few months, then suddenly stopped before his book The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man was finished.

The author recalls that he used to write messages for what he believed was his secret reader, but he never got any response.

'All authors expect criticism. But criticism before publication by an anonymous, divine third party is something novel,' Harding added.
