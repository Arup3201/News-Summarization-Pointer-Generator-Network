The girlfriend of a man who shot and killed a German exchange student in his garage broke down in tears as her 911 call was re-played to a court.

Janelle Pflager's  distraught voice was heard by the court during the 911 call she made after her boyfriend, Markus Kaarma, allegedly shot and killed Diren Dede, 17. 

She described how the teenager was lying face down 'barely breathing' and bleeding from 'everywhere' in their Missoula, Montana home.

Family: Marcus Kaarma, right, is followed into Missoula District Court by his girlfriend Janelle Pflager with their child, the court heard a 911 call made by Pflager about the events that unfolded 

Fear: Kaarma allegedly felt targeted and increasingly anxious for the safety of Pflager and their infant son

She told dispatchers that Kaarma didn't help her as she tried to aid the  wounded high school student, who died a short time later at a Missoula hospital. 

Kaarma is charged with baiting the teenager into sneaking into his Missoula garage early on April 27 and killing him with four shotgun blasts after being alerted by a motion detector. 

Defense attorney Paul Ryan says Montana's 'stand your ground' law allows homeowners to protect their residences with deadly force when they believe they are going to be harmed.

But Kaarma didn't know whether the person inside the garage was armed, Ryan said. 

However he had allegedly felt targeted and increasingly anxious for the safety of Pflager and their infant son after the couple had been burglarized twice in the days leading up to the shooting. 

On the first day of testimony, two teenagers, Mykle Martin, 17, and Trisitan Staber, 18, described how they went 'garage hopping,' or burglarizing garages, in search of alcohol and other things after dark and hit Markus Kaarma's house. 

'I was the previous break-in,' Martin said, his voice at times barely audible. 'I'm the reason he (Kaarma) was waiting for another person.' 

The court also heard audio tapes of Pflager's police interview after the shooting. 

She told officers that Dede had pleaded for his life, saying, 'No, no, no, no, no, please!'

However, she later testified that Dede had not said anything and that she was 'rambling' to officers because she was traumatized.

'I did not hear those words,' she said. 'I wish I said those words.' 

Pflager's testimony came during the second day of Kaarma's deliberate homicide trial.

Pflager said Thursday that she kept a baseball bat nearby while Kaarma moved a shotgun to the first floor of their home after the previous burglaries. 

Testimony indicated Kaarma was upset and on edge at the time.

Michael McMillan, who works for a local lawn care company told how he came to the Kaarma house on April 23 to spray for insects. 

While he was setting up, he said an angry Kaarma come out the front door naked, pointed a shotgun at him and asked what McMillan was doing there.

'I was scared, frozen,' McMillan said.

He said Pflager started screaming at Kaarma to stop and he went back inside the house. McMillan said Pflager later apologized and told him they were on edge due to burglaries. 

McMillan said he did not call police.

That same day, Kaarma went for a haircut, and three women from the shop testified Thursday that they heard him say he had been waiting up nights to shoot an intruder.

The dead teenager's father, Celal Dede, grimaced while listening to the 911 recording and then whispered to his attorneys that accompanied him and his wife.
