Chris Rushworth claimed an incredible 15 wickets as Durham beat Northamptonshire by an innings and 219 runs at Chester-le-Street. 

The 28-year-old paceman took nine wickets for just 52 runs in 12 overs as Northants' were bowled out for just 83 runs in their first innings. 

Ben Stokes got a scalp of his own with the wicket of Maurice Chambers to prevent Rushworth from claiming all ten.

In the second innings, Rushworth claimed another six wickets to reach 15 wickets for the match - and the day - surpassing Alan Walker's 19-year-old Durham record.

Walker previously took 14-177 against Essex in 1995 but Rushworth's figures of 15-95 means he is the first Durham bowler to take 15 first-class wickets in a match. 

And after play finished, Rushworth was embraced by Walker on the balcony.

Rushworth dismissed Keaton Jennings for a duck, with a score of just one on the board, and then continued to take wicket after wicket before claiming Northants' final batsman Muhammad Azharullah for two runs to wrap up the innings.

And, after forcing Northants to follow on, Rushworth then claimed another six wickets as Northants' crumbed to 90 all out in their second innings. 

He was later given a rest, having bowled 20 overs - in between a lunch and innings break - and Peter Chase and Varun Aaron completed an innings and 219-run victory for Durham.

Last season's County Championship winners Durham had put the visitors into bat at the Emirates ICG after posting 392 in their first innings.

Captain Paul Collingwood (101) and Scott Borthwick (136) both made centuries and set a Chester-le-Street record fifth-wicket stand of 187.

Rushworth's remarkable spell appears to have put the final nail in the coffin of Northants' Division One status.

They sit bottom of the table - 76 points adrift of Lancashire and 88 from safety - and look certain to lose this match too, with just one game remaining in the season.

Chris Rushworth rewrote Durham's history books with 15 wickets in 20 overs in their innings victory over Northamptonshire.

But what else is known about the 28-year-old seamer?

Few outside Durham, and perhaps not that many inside either, will be able to tell you much about an unheralded ex-Northumberland Minor Counties cricketer who is making the most of his second shot at the professional game after being released by his current employers seven years ago.

Undeterred, the Sunderland-born cousin of Durham and former England wicketkeeper Phil Mustard, fought his way back into the reckoning after spells selling satellite dishes and working in a call centre.

In that time, coincidentally, Northants were one of two other counties to reject him after a trial - and Rushworth went back to club cricket with Sunderland to try to catch Durham's eye again.

It worked - and in 53 first-class matches before his date with destiny in an end-of-season championship fixture at home to relegated Northants, he had taken a 167 wickets at a laudable average of 26.5.

Balding, Rushworth cuts a throwback figure to another recent Durham favourite Neil Killeen - and he was a near ever-present in his team's unexpected march last summer to a third championship title in six seasons.

Others then grabbed most of the headlines nonetheless, but this time the limelight is his alone.
