An overweight nurse claimed her £10,000 NHS gastric band made her sick, so she had it loosened – only to balloon to nearly her original weight.

Faye Attwood, 26, said the band ‘ruined her life’ after she dropped half her bodyweight to 12st, then quickly piled most of it back on.

Miss Attwood was once 24st and a size 24 and would gorge on 12 packs of Wotsits and 600g chocolate bars for breakfast.

She had surgery in December 2010, and lost a dramatic 12st in the next year, going to a size ten.

However, she said she spent months in pain, always hungry but unable to keep food down.

With
 the gastric band in place, her appetite should have decreased 
significantly, but Miss Attwood claims that she noticed no difference.

In March 2012, doctors slightly loosened the band, which is designed to reduce the size of the stomach and limit food intake.

Today, Ms Attwood has yo-yoed back to an unhealthy 20 stone - almost the same weight as she was when she first underwent the operation

She stopped being sick – but started to gain weight, and has now reached 20st. She is also back on virtually the same diet of pizzas and chips.

Miss Attwood, of Kings Norton, Birmingham, said people should think twice about gastric bands.

She said: ‘It has been a horror story from the start.

Dr Ahmed Ahmed, consultant batriatric surgeon at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital told MailOnline that it was 'very rare' for gastric bands to fail in this fashion.

He said: 'They are one of the safest operations. Of the 2,100 operations carried out each year, the complication rate is only 0.09 per cent, according to the National Bariatric Surgery Registry.'

As well as the silicone plastic ring that is the gastric band, there is also a balloon inside it that determines the tightness - depending on how much liquid is in it.

Dr Ahmed said: 'I can only imagine some liquid was taken out of the band to loosen it before gallbladder surgery - although there is no reason for this - and the correct tightness has never been achieved again since.'

He added there was no reason why having gallstones or the gallbladder removed should affect the outcome of the surgery.

‘Instead of never feeling hungry, now I never feel full. I would go to a buffet and just eat everything, I would just keep going back.’

The
 mental health nurse claims the surgery is not effective and says people
 should ‘do things the  natural way by going to the gym and eating the 
right foods’.

She said: ‘I 
want to appeal to everyone not to have a gastric band, even if it is 
offered to you for free on the NHS, because it has ruined my life and 
could ruin other people’s.’

Miss
 Attwood had surgery at Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham after being 
diagnosed with gallstones, which could only be removed if she lost 
weight.

She began eating healthy chicken and vegetables and went to the gym five times a week.

But doctors feared the band was not working and tightened it eight times, until she slimmed to 12st by January last year.

However,
 she claims the weight only came off because the tight band made her 
constantly unwell.

She said: ‘I couldn’t keep anything down, I was being
 sick all the time, it was awful.

‘Every six weeks the band was re-tightened.’

Ms Attwood (before surgery) is now warning others to think twice about having gastric bands fitted. She said 'It has been a horror story from the start and it has ruined by life'

In March last year, the band was loosened because she felt so ill – triggering rapid weight gain.

‘Because I had been so deprived of food I suddenly rebelled and literally couldn’t stop eating,’ Miss Attwood said.

‘I started to load back up on fatty cakes and greasy chips and in the end I was eating more than I was before surgery.

‘Before
 long my new size ten clothes were way too tight. I realised the gorging
 had to stop, but the fatter I got the more I comfort ate.

The doctors 
said this has happened before but it is rare. I stopped going to the gym
 and put all the weight back on and now I weigh 20st.’

Dr
 Andy Carson, a Birmingham GP, said: ‘Gastric bands can often be an 
effective means of losing weight, but there is much additional work to 
be done in terms of counselling to make sure that there is psychological
 support in place afterwards.

‘Not being her doctor it is difficult to pinpoint what has gone wrong in this individual case.’
