Playing golf is about to get a whole lot easier - as courses across the U.S. introduce a 15-inch hole on the putting green.

The hole will be boosted from 4 inches to 15 inches in a pilot scheme - which is to be trialled at 100 courses across the country.

It is hoped the move will improve player's scores, increase game speed and encourage more
 beginners to take up the sport - which has lost around five million players
 in the U.S. alone over the past 10 years.

The average size of a golf hole is to be increased to 15inches in a pilot scheme which will be introduced to 100 courses across the U.S. and Canada. It is hoped the move will encourage more people to take up the sport

Sergio Garcia, pictured during day one of the 2012 Open Championship at Royal Lytham & St. Annes Golf Club, says the holes will help encourage more beginners to take up the sport

The new holes, which will be about the 
size of an average pizza, have the backing of Ted Bishop, the president 
of the Professional Golfers Association of America.

He said: 'We’ve got to stop scaring people away from golf by telling them that there is only one way to play the game.'

The Reynolds Plantation in Greensboro, Georgia, is to install the 15-inch holes. Top players Sergio García and Justin Rose played on the new course during a promotional event held last month.

At the event, Mr Garcia said: 'A 15in hole could help junior golfers, beginning golfers and older golfers score better, play faster and like golf more.'

One course in Canada, the Redwoods Golf Course in Langley, British Columbia, is also to install the larger holes.

Doug Hawley, managing director of the course, told CBC News : 'Younger folks just don't think it's cool.

'Golf hasn't really grown. It hasn't really declined. It's just staying stable.

Justin Rose misses a putt on 18th hole at the European Ryder Cup. The sport is thought to have originated in Scotland in the 15th Century - although some suggest it originates from the Roman game paganica

'If you can take out some of the frustration out the game ... the more relaxed they are, the more they'll enjoy their day, and the more they'll want to come back.'

According to the National Golf Foundation, the sport has lost about 5million US players in a decade.

Their research found that players under the age of 35, many of whom say it is too difficult, are most likely to give up playing.

Nobody was available from the golf's professional body, The R&A, to comment on the changes.

Golf historians differ as to where the game originated. Some say it originated in Scotland in the 15th Century.

However, others insist the sport dates back to the Roman game of paganica - where players used a bent stick to hit a leather ball.

Certain historians say paganica spread through Europe as the Romans conquered the continent before it developed into the modern game.

A boost in hole size is far from the only change in golfing history.

Until the fifties, a golfer was not allowed to move an opponent's ball if it fell in front of theirs. After a series of revisions, the so-called Stymie Rule was abolished in 1952.

Until 1974, golfers were allowed to use a ball that was 1.62inches in diameter in the British Open - but it was made illegal in 1988. Since then, the United States Golf Association's 1.68inch diameter model has been the only one allowed.

Currently, if a player wishes to drop their ball back in to play, they must extend their arm out in from of them and drop it from shoulder height. Until 1984, the ball had to be dropped over the shoulder.

Previously, players were penalised if an element beyond their control caused their ball to move on the green. However, after several high-profile players were affected, the USGA took action and from 2012, players are allowed to play from the new spot if their ball moves due to reasons beyond their control.

Those using long putters - such as Adam Scott and Webb Simpson - were hit with a shake-up last year. Although the 2013 USGA rule doesn't completely ban long putters - which are, as the name suggests, longer versions of their regular counterparts -  it prohibits players from anchoring them to their body during the stroke.

Following the controversial ruling, USGA Executive Director Mike Davis said: 'This decision gets back to the USGA and R&A feeling that fundamentally golf for 600 years has been about picking up the club, gripping it with two hands and making a free swing away from the body.'
