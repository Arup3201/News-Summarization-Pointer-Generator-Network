He’s the new man about town and eight-year-old Dunlop is making quite a splash with the ladies.

The stocky sea lion has puckered up for a whiskery kiss with just one of his girlfriends at the Sea Life centre in Mooloolaba, on the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, to celebrate Valentine’s Day.

Sitting back on his flippers, Dunlop holds his head high and closes his eyes as his latest lady friend reaches to give him a wet peck.

Dunlop only arrived in Mooloolaba in December but the charismatic mammal is already fitting in well.

Along with 18-year-old female Katanya, Dunlop was brought to the Sea Life centre as part of its breeding and marine protection program.

Sea Life Mooloolaba Mammals Manager, Mark Ryan, said while the two are yet to officially seal the deal, all signs are pointing towards breeding success. 

‘Dunlop is taking a liking to some of the females we have here at SEA LIFE Mooloolaba and he certainly has his pick of the bunch, so we are confident these signs of affection will result in breeding,’ Mr Ryan said.

Dunlop reportedly has more than one girlfriend at the seal life sanctuary where breeders hope he will become a father 

‘Not many people realise that Australian Sea Lions are an endangered species, with less than 15,000 left in the wild, so it is important that we work together to further educate the public on seals, while enhancing conservation efforts and breeding programs.

‘It will be a major step towards understanding and protecting the species, while continuing the attraction’s conservation mission to educate the public about these animals.’

The centre recently launched an interactive ‘Seal Discovery’ experience, where visitors can experience the sounds, smell and sight of the creatures – including a pod where you can learn to talk like a seal.
