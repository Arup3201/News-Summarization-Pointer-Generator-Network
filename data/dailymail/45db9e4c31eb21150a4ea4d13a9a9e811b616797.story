Howard's Way actor Nigel Davenport, has died at the age of 85

Actor Nigel Davenport, best known for 
his roles in Chariots of Fire, A Man For All Seasons and the TV series 
Howards’ Way, has died at the age of 85.

The
 versatile star developed a reputation for playing strong, brooding 
heroes and dark villains – aided by his imposing stature and intense 
glare.

But he will also be remembered for his powerful voice, said to be the ‘envy of many an aspiring actor’.

His
 characters, in a career of more than 50 years, ranged from a detective 
in the cult film Peeping Tom to aggressive boss Jim Fraser in Oil Strike
 North. His on-screen authority saw him frequently cast as aristocrats 
and monarchs, such as George III in the TV mini-series Prince Regent.

But
 whether on stage or screen, Davenport’s roles were all enhanced by the 
resonant rasp in his voice and what he referred to as his ‘dodgy’ stare.

He
 suffered from a strong squint that meant he could see little out of his
 right eye and, in 1953, had an operation to repair it after overhearing
 a director say: ‘That young man will never get anywhere unless he does 
something about his eyes.’

The
 surgery failed and the problem remained for the rest of his life. But 
for many it was that distinctive gaze that made his performances so 
memorable.

His agent, 
Nicholas Young, said yesterday: ‘It was a privilege, a pleasure and an 
honour to have represented Nigel. Not only was he an excellent actor, 
but he was also a charming, warm and witty man.

‘His
 performances over the years were powerful and moving. His voice, the 
envy of many an aspiring actor, was a joy to listen to.’

Mr
 Young added that the actor, who died on Friday after suffering from 
pneumonia, was ‘never afraid to give his opinion’ and was ‘immensely 
popular’.

Although 
Davenport appeared in more than 40 feature films and TV programmes, he 
began his career in theatre, joining Oxford University’s drama society 
while studying English there.

He
 honed his vocal skills working as a military radio DJ in Hamburg in the
 1950s during service with the Royal Army Service Corps, before landing 
his first professional acting job – in the Noel Coward play Relative 
Values – at the Savoy in 1952.

His huge presence led one writer to describe him as someone who looked ‘as if he might knock you through the wall for sport’.

It
 was a characteristic he used to full effect in his breakthrough role as
 the powerful Duke of Norfolk in A Man For All Seasons in 1966.

Davenport
 was an active member of actors’ union Equity and was its president from
 1986 to 1992. But he was less consistent in his politics, starting out 
as a staunch left-winger, before becoming an early supporter of Margaret
 Thatcher.

He then switched
 allegiance to the SDP before returning to Labour and then declared 
himself a ‘Radical’, declining to vote at all.

As
 well as playing Lord Birkenhead in 1981 film Chariots of Fire, 
Davenport will be best remembered as tycoon Sir Edward Frere in BBC1’s 
Howards’ Way, the Sunday night drama featuring a wealthy yachting set.

Shortly
 after appearing in a 2000 dramatisation of David Copperfield, he 
retired from acting as he could no longer memorise lines.

The
 actor had three children – Hugo, a writer, and Laura, an actress, with 
his first wife Helena White, and Jack, also an actor, with his second 
wife Maria Aitken, whom he divorced in 1981.

He
 spent his last years in Gloucestershire, enjoying fiercely competitive 
games of backgammon,  Scrabble and Monopoly, and indulging his lifelong 
passion for horse racing.
