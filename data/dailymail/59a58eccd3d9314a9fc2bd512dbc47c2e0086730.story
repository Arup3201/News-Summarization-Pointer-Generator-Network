A sorority girl at the University of Maryland is facing outrage after she posed for a photo with a racist birthday cake made of alcohol bottles that reads, 's*** a n**** d***' on her 21st birthday.

The photo from Delta Gamma Sorority was posted online to Instagram along with an offensive hashtag comment that featured the 'n-word.'

University of Maryland student Chandler Perry told Pulsefeedz that she saw the photo on her Instagram feed and was angered by what she saw.

Made headlines: This Instagram photo of a girl at the University of Maryland from Delta Gamma Sorority Inc. with a cake along with a racist remark has some students fuming

Controversy: Offended students took to Yik Yak to express their disdain for the post while others defended it

I was so baffled that 77 people liked it and none of those 77 people told her it was inappropriate,' Perry said.

The photo reached the eyes of the vice president of public relations for the University of Maryland's Black Student Union Samira Jackson who wasn’t pleased.

'I didn’t know it was okay for white people to say n**** now? Who knew?'

As soon as the University heard about the backlash surrounding the photo, The University of Maryland Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life posted a response to their Twitter and said, 'We are aware of an insensitive post from a community member and are addressing it with the chapter as it does not align with our Greek values.'

Hitting back: Upon hearing about the racist Instagram photo the University of Maryland's Greek life organization made it clear they were not linked to the post  

Taking responsibility: The Delta Gamma sorority chapter in Maryland took to Facebook to label the photo and comment inappropriate and not in line with their beliefs 

The sorority posted on their Facebook saying, 'We have become aware of an unacceptable Instagram post by a member of our chapter. The Fraternity volunteers and staff are working with our chapter at the University of Maryland at this time to hold this member accountable.'

'Delta Gamma Fraternity is a dynamic organization committed to diversity and does not discriminate on the basis of race, religious affiliation, color, creed, national origin, sexual orientation, marital status or physical disability. All efforts are in place to guarantee those selected for membership are committed to living our values. Delta Gamma stands for high ideals of friendship, promoting cultural and educational interests, a true sense of social responsibility and developing the best qualities of character,' they concluded.

Delta Gamma made headlines back in April of 2013 when a tirade of an email was sent to the sorority sisters telling them to stop being so 'f****ing awkward and boring.'

'And for those of you who are offended at this email, I would apologize but I really don't give a f***. Go f*** yourself,' concluded the email.

It seems as though offensive public outcries are a bit of an unofficial tradition for the University of Maryland's Greek organization.
