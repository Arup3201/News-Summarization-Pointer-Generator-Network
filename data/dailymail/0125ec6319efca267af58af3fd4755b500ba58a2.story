The National Security Agency collects hundreds of millions of text messages from around the world every day, according to the latest Edward Snowden revelation.

NSA spies cast a global net collecting about 200million texts a day for the purposes of extracting phone metadata such as location, contacts and financial info, the Guardian reported.

The spy agency also shares the collected information with British spy agency GCHQ, according to the paper.

The report details the program codenamed ‘Dishfire.’

Dishfire indiscriminately collects and stores ‘pretty much everything it can’ without discerning between actual surveillance targets and innocent civilians.

The messages gathered are usually automated messages people receive when they miss calls, are roaming internationally or come from bank and credit card transactions.

Spies are then able piece together people’s travels, contacts, spending habits and more – this work is not limited to persons of interest.

The Guardian revealed several slides from a 2011 NSA presentation titled ‘SMS Text Messages: A Goldmine to Exploit.’ The presentation, just like others published in the paper, details exactly how the dragnet operates.

A program referred to as ‘Prefer’ is used in tandem with Dishfire to mine the automated messages and source ‘content-derived metadata.’

Typical days saw more than 5million missed call alerts, roughly 1.6million border crossings, about 110,000 names and over 800,000 financial transactions mined by the spooks.

Geolocation data was also extracted from a further 76,000 texts a day from ‘requests by people for route info’ and ‘setting up meetings,’ as well as travel advisories including flight delays and cancellations.

Documents shown in the Guardian report suggest that U.S. phone numbers are removed from the database, but others – including U.K.-based communications – are retained.

GCHQ is not permitted to search through the data without a warrant, but are able to historically = see who U.K.-based persons are texting.

A GCHQ memo published in the paper details what sets the NSA program apart from the rest.‘In contrast to [most] GCHQ equivalents, DISHFIRE contains a large volume of unselected SMS traffic,’ the memo reads.

Mostly automated messages: The texts snared by the NSA are mostly automated notifications from a variety of services used by everyday people

‘This makes it particularly useful for the development of new targets, since it is possible to examine the content of messages sent months or even years before the target was known to be of interest.’

Security analysts are asked in a separate GCHQ memo to limit their searches to no more than 1,800 numbers at a time, a show of how encompassing the program can be in the right hands.

An NSA spokesperson denied the agency has unfettered access to global text messages, and claimed to the Guardian that any suggestion to the contrary is false.

A GCHQ spokesperson declined to comment to the paper, saying that ‘it is a longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters.’

The revelations came only one day before U.S. President Barack Obama is set to publicly speak about possible NSA reforms.
