Losing 22-0 would normally be seen as a disaster – but when it is a non-League side facing Russia's Under-19 national side then it is important to take the positives.

On an afternoon when Chelsea were beating Arsenal at Stamford Bridge and Manchester United returned to winning ways against Everton, Cheadle Town were trending higher on Twitter thanks to their thrashing.

Cheadle, currently seventh in the North West Counties League first division, found themselves on the end of the heaviest defeat in the club’s history when they faced the Russia U19s.

Cheadle Town could do little to prevent Russia's Under-19 national side storming to an incredible 22-0 win

Cheadle Town have decided to make the most of the 22-0 defeat by celebrating their Twitter followers doubling

Twitter saw 8,800 retweets for the full-time score

It is not the first time Cheadle have faced high-profile opposition as they were on the end of a 5-0 score line against Dinamo Bucharest in pre-season.

On Sunday, it took Russia's youngsters just four minutes to go 1-0 up. By half time it was 9-0 and Cheadle had no substitutes available. 

In between, though, they were rather excited when the home side edged forward as Cheadle wrote on Twitter: 'WE'VE GOT A CORNER!!'

But the main positives to be taken from the defeat is that the club’s Twitter account saw its followers double.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5Live, Cheadle Town’s website and social media manager Karl Florczak said: ‘We played Dinamo Bucharest in a pre-season summer friendly, and there was a contact who got back in touch with us and said the Russia U19 side were knocking around in the North West and would we like to play them.

‘If you are a football club at level 10 of the pyramid and someone approaches you and asks if you would like to have a go at the Russia U19s then you are not going to turn them down.

‘To the best of my knowledge it is the heaviest defeat in the club’s history. But in the club’s defence we have three squads, the 1st XI, the reserves and also the U21s. All three squads had matches this weekend and what we put out was a bit of a scratch squad.

‘To be fair, the Russia U19s were technically superb and even if we had put out our strongest XI then we would still have been on the end of a very severe beating.’

Cheadle return to league action on Wednesday when they face Widnes, and Florczak thinks one or two of the players may need an arm around the shoulder as they try and forget about this scoreline.

He added: ‘Time will tell how the players will take it. They were frustrated halfway through the game, but there were a few smiles at the end, but I think we need to have a word with them before Wednesday night and remind them that it was the Russia U19 national side.

‘Today was a one-touch football master class. It was superb to watch for the neutral to watch, but it was not great for me as I was tweeting every goal as they went in.

‘On Wednesday we have another first team game against Widnes and if I were a betting man then I would say that we will win that game 1-0!’

But for Florczak, who tweeted all the goals as they went in, he saw the club trend on Twitter as the game and the scoreline became the talk of social media on Sunday afternoon.

He added: ‘Before the game we had the region of 1,500 twitter followers, now we are knocking on the door of 3,000 now. When I posted the full time score of 22-0 it was retweeted 5,000 times.’

While Cheadle face Widnes on Wendesday, the Russia U19s will face the Faroe Islands U19s on Thursday.
