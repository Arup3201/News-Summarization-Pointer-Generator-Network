Jailed: Matthew Hudson (above), 22, left his friend Mark Bennett with life-threatening injuries after attacking him with a glass at his sister's wedding

A man who smashed a pint glass into a friend's neck during his sister's wedding reception was jailed for three and half years today.

Matthew Hudson, 22, left Mark Bennett with life-threatening injuries after  attacking him without warning as they walked out of a marquee set up in the grounds of a luxury farmhouse.

Mr Bennett was left with shards of glass in his neck narrowly missing a vital artery and was aided by two trained nurses attending the wedding before being rushed to hospital and operated on. 

He said he was lucky to survive the attack  given the nature and location of his injuries.

In a victim impact statement Mr Bennett said: 'I hope he recognises his reckless actions could so easily have been fatal.' 

Hudson never gave an explanation for the incident or give any indication as to why he had attacked his friend at the wedding of his sister Chantelle and Brett Gregson.

At Preston Crown Court, Lancashire, self-employed plasterer Hudson, of Kirkham, was found guilty of wounding after a trial. 

The incident took place in May last year at a £500,000 farmhouse owned by the bridegroom's parents in the rural village of Wrea Green. 

A marquee had been erected at the farm for the guests attending the event following the wedding of Hudson's unnamed sister.

The court heard Hudson went after Mr Bennett with a glass and confronted the victim before smashing it against his neck.

Prosecutor Mr Richard Haworth said: 'The complainant wishes he could understand why it took place and hopes the defendant is remorseful and regrets what he has done.

'He recounts how he lies in bed at night and relives matters and thinks about the consequences. He expresses his gratitude to the surgeons at the Royal Preston Hospital to remove the shards of glass still in the very vulnerable area of the neck.

'He describes having problems sleeping, taking prescription sleeping tablets and describes how he awakes often in distress. His self confidence had hit rock bottom and feels very self conscious as to the scar on his neck. He feels on edge when he is out and aware of stares and finger pointing.

'He is paranoid that everyone is looking at him and does from time to time wear clothing to hide it, scarves to avoid people asking questions. He doesn't want to go out at all.'

He added that Mr Bennett attends therapy and may need plastic surgery in the future for the 'raised and angry scarring'. 

He added: 'The impact upon his social life, he avoids get togethers and family meals and hates being the centre of attention. he is embarrassed and vulnerable to questions put to him about how he is.'

Mr Haworth added that he had been an avid Manchester City fan and had held a season ticket for many years travelling to home, away and even abroad games. However since the attack he is no longer confident enough to go.

Mr Haworth added that it was 'a huge change to what his social life used to be' and that his circle of friends has reduced. 

Mr Bennett also suffered at work and found it difficult dealing with customers, feeling self-conscious and said his business had suffered.

Hudson had two convictions in the last six years for battery and disorderly behaviour and nine years ago he was given a caution for assault occasioning actual body harm. 

His counsel Iain Simkin said the single but 'damaging' blow had occurred whilst he was drunk.

He added: 'He does present as a docile character whilst in drink he behaves in a wholly different way. 

'There is genuine remorse even though there was a trial, particularly as he considers the victim was a friend. 

'His judgement was skewed by drink. He has the support of a loving family, they understand what is going to happen to him and understand he is going to prison for what he has done.'

Passing sentence Judge Stuart Baker told Hudson: 'You now realise the enormity of what you did and realise how close Mr Bennett came to possibly losing his life'

Passing sentence Judge Stuart Baker told Hudson. 'You now realise the enormity of what you did and realise how close Mr Bennett came to possibly losing his life. 

'Quite why you behaved in the way you did, no one is likely to know. Others who speak well of you are at a loss as to why you behaved the way you did. 

'Your conduct is not excused by being in drink. Committing an offence whilst fuelled by alcohol is aggravating to the offence, it is not an excuse.

'You committed the offence when Mr Bennett was leaving the premises where the party had taken place. 

'He was beyond the gateway, he was on the road walking away from the property when you attacked him when you had a glass in your hand. It may have been that when you left you did not have in your mind attacking him with the glass.

'You went after him, when you did confront him for reasons known only to yourself you struck him with the glass to the side of the neck that caused not only life threatening injuries but very unsightly scarring he will have to live with for the rest of his life long after you have served your prison sentence.

'The effect on his has been quite substantial. He realises how close he came to losing his life. He is troubled at night. 

Hudson was sentenced to three and a half years at Preston Crown Court, above, today

'He can't fully understand why it happened. His confidence is at a very low ebb, understandably he is very self conscious. I have no reason to doubt it has had a significant impact upon his social life.

'You used a glass as a weapon, thankfully it was not a weapon which was already smashed but even in its state it was still a weapon.'

He added that he must also bear in mind Hudson's previous convictions.

'You have resorted to violence rather than walking away from violence. This incident occurred at what should have been an extremely happy event. 

'Many people were present, they would have been understandably shocked by what they saw when Mr Bennett returned in his injured state. 'All those who saw Mr Bennett would have been greatly shocked by the scene.'
