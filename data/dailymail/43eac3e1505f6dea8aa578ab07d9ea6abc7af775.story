Lewis Hamilton dedicated his victory at the Russian Grand Prix to Jules Bianchi, the Marussia driver whose desperate condition in a Japanese hospital cast a shadow over Sunday’s race.

His team-mate Max Chilton pulled out of the race after nine laps because he felt ‘uncomfortable’ in his car, which was vibrating.

Marussia did not race their other car out of respect to Bianchi, who hit a tractor seven days before in Japan and remains in a life-threatening condition.

Before the race, the drivers stood in silence in a show of support for the Frenchman. Jenson Button, who came fourth for McLaren, said: ‘When you put on the helmet and get in the car and race, it is a nice place to be because you are in another world.

‘On the grid was emotional for everyone and we, the drivers, had our time together. We were there for Jules.

‘Then getting back into the car was the trickiest bit. Every driver feels the same pain but when we get into the car and close our visors we get on with it. It is good we drive our hearts out.

‘Different things go through your head and you have your emotional moments. For us drivers, we weren’t thinking about the national anthem; we were thinking about Jules.’

Yesterday’s race passed without incident. It was dry and the safety car was not needed.

Hamilton, the race winner, said: ‘All week there has been just one person on my mind, and that’s Jules. Without a doubt every time I’ve got in a car, I’ve been thinking about him and his family and keeping him in my prayers.

‘Whether it means anything or whether it doesn’t, it would be great to dedicate this to Jules and his family. It will make a very small difference to them, for sure. But every bit of positive energy hopefully will help.

‘All you guys in the media, and all us teams are sending him our positive vibes that way because positive energy is actually real.’
