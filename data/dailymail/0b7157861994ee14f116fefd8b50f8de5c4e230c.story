The six-year police veteran who was shot dead this weekend in a grisly murder-suicide at a Dallas apartment was allegedly abusive to the shooter, who told a 911 operator she was his girlfriend before turning the gun on herself.

On Monday, police identified the shooter as 42-year-old Otto Machelle Thomas. They say Thomas called 911 around 6:15pm to report that she had murdered her boyfriend, 40-year-old Larry Tuttle, and that someone needed to come pick up her 6-year-old daughter. 

Thomas revealed her motives to the operator, saying: 'He was getting ready to hit me again and I just went off. I killed him because he was going to hit me again.'

Murder-suicide: 42-year-old mother Otto Machelle Thomas, left, called 911 on Saturday to say she shot dead her boyfriend 40-year-old cop Larry Tuttle, right, because she feared he would hit her 'again'. When officers arrived on the scene, Thomas committed suicide by shooting herself

When officers arrived at the scene, they ordered Thomas to  put away her weapon and unlock the door to Tuttle's apartment.  

Instead, she walked away from the window and a gunshot was heard. SWAT teams swarmed the apartment and found the couple dead, with Thomas' young daughter uninjured in a bedroom.

Her daughter, who neighbors say is autistic, has been transferred to the care of Child Protective Services, which are trying to get in contact with Thomas' family in Mississippi. 

Police say there have been no prior disturbance or domestic violence calls to the apartment. 

Tuttle's wife Kandie Morgan told KXAS- TV that they had been separated for a few months, and that he had been a great father to their 10-year-old son.  

Police are unsure whether Thomas was living with Tuttle at the apartment. They say she recently lived in an apartment in Arlington.

Thomas was featured in a short article in a 2001 issue of Ebony magazine, which described her as a military police officer in the Army who counseled youth groups. 

At the time she was living in Kansas City, Kansas and that she had a son, suggesting that she has an older child. 

She has no other criminal record besides a 1996 harassment charge in Bell County, Texas that was dismissed. 

Tuttle's neighbor Jared Ingram said he often saw the father and his son around the Lake Highlands Landing apartments. 

'[They were] playing with different things, playing with his toys, cleaning up his house sometimes, things like that,' Ingram said, adding that Tuttle was a 'good neighbor'. 

The Dallas Police Association wrote on Facebook Monday that Tuttle was a 'great officer who will never be forgotten'.
