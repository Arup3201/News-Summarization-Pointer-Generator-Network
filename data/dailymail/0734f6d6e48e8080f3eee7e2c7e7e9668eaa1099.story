Plans have been unveiled for a £60 million 'mega-mansion' which will be more than 45 times the size of the average new home.

Windlesham House, near Ascot, will be set in 20 acres of Surrey countryside and is set to have 42,000 sq/ft of living space when completed - making it one of the UK's largest new homes.

Developers say the main body of the building and its side wings will boast 15 enormous bedrooms, all with en suite, and ten reception rooms also with accommodation.

There will also be a fitness complex, cinema, billiards room, juice bar and even its own ten-pin bowling alley.

Outside, there will be immaculately prepared gardens and garaging for up to 'six supercars and limousines'. 

The mega-home, designed by Consero London, will go onto the market for £60 million - a price-tag almost unheard of outside of London.

Location: The land on which the huge mansion will stand has been cleared of trees, and is located close to the village of Windlesham in Surrey

Gateway: The house will be built on undeveloped land, behind this gateway off a quiet country road

It is more than twice the price of the most expensive home currently being offered on the market in Surrey.

In comparison, the average price for a home sold in Surrey over the past 12 months is around £310,000.

Windlesham House is one of four new classical mansions worth £145 million being developed in Surrey by Consero.

Over the past decade, the luxury developer has built and sold luxury properties valued at more than £1 billion.

Steve Glover, joint founding director at Consero London, said: 'Windlesham will be arguably one of the most luxurious residences outside of London.

'The 42,000 sq ft mansion is set in 20 acres of beautiful landscaped grounds and parkland and when complete, will be the perfect country estate for the discerning purchaser.'

Location: The property will stand around half a mile from the centre of Windlesham village
