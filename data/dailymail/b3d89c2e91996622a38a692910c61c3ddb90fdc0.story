A rare bone cribbage board played on by Viscount Nelson as he sailed to fight at Trafalgar has been discovered after lying in a dusty drawer for more than 70 years.

The item had lain at the back of the jammed drawer until it was found by auctioneer Toby Jenkins in a Victorian desk worth just £30.

Mr Jenkins had been given the desk to sell as part of the clearance from a small English museum.

Discovery: The rare bone cribbage board had been hidden in a dusty drawer for more than 70 years

Entertainment: Admiral Nelson kept himself busy by playing the game as he sailed to fight at Trafalgar.

Despite 
its low value Mr Jenkins decided to smarten up the lot for auction and ensure 
the desk was in working condition which meant he had to battle with one 
particularly stubborn drawer.

Having eased it open Mr Jenkins was amazed to discover a tiny bone cribbage scoring board with an inscription on the back.

Nelson had to keep himself amused at sea

On the reverse there was a handwritten label dated around 1940s in appearance stating the name of the donor as Byron S.G Penn.

Handwritten in ink next to that label were the words: 'The cribbage board used by Victory Nelson & Admiral Quilliam'

Admiral John Quilliam rose quickly through the ranks before he was hand-picked by Nelson to serve under him as a first lieutenant on the famous HMS Victory.

During the Battle of Trafalgar he bravely steered the Victory into action on October 21, 1805.

An extract from James’s Naval History of Great Britain reads: 'Just as she (the Victory) had got about 500 yards of the larboard beam of the Bucentaure the Victory’s mizzen-topmast was shot away, about two-thirds up.

'A shot also struck and knocked to pieces the wheel; and the ship was obliged to be steered from the gun room, the first lieutenant (John Quilliam) and master (Thomas Atkinson) relieving each other at the duty.'

Mr Jenkins, from Auction-Plus, Nuneaton, Warks, said what could have been just the sale of a £30 desk could now be worth thousands.

A similar cribbage board with no connection to Nelson would be expected to fetch £400 - £600, but the last item of Nelson memorabilia - a quill pen and handwritten letter went for £8,500.

Delicate: The rare bone cribbage board withstood the rough seas and has been out of action for 70 years

Trafalgar: The Franco-Spanish fleet lost twenty-two ships, without a single British vessel being lost.

He said: “At first we thought this was 
too good to be true, but after further investigation we discovered 
papers in the National Archive relating to the donor’s name Byron S. G. 
Penn.

'His name had been applied to the piece by a museum back in the 1950s and had himself been a direct descendant of Admiral Quilliam.

'Upon the donor’s death his family had indeed donated items to the district in which the bureau had originated and from where it came to us.

'The last curator of the museum was as far as we know the first to properly catalogue the items in their possession around the late1980s.

Bargain: The Victorian desk in which Toby Jenkins found the cribbage game was worth just £30

possession around the late1980s

Lucky find: auctioneer Toby Jenkins only wanted to fix the desk

'It’s not surprising that this unique object was missed whilst cataloguing the items more recently especially as no recent staff could have had any idea that such a thing was hiding in their possession for all these years.'

In cribbage players put pins in holes on the scoreboard until a target number of points is reached, typically 61 or 121.

Points are scored for card combinations that add up to fifteen, and for pairs, triples, quadruples, runs, and flushes.

Mr Jenkins said that at first he thought the cribbage board was just a piece of wood lodged in the drawer.

He said: 'I managed to open all parts of the desk but one drawer with relative ease but could only force the last drawer to open slightly.

'I could see by torch light through a crack that there was something like a piece of wood jammed.

'Such items often have thin wood stationary dividers within them so I immediately thought it was such a piece which had become dislodged.

'With a little brute force and a screw driver together with 20 minutes or so jiggling I eventually managed to prize the drawer open.'

Nelson’s and Quilliam’s cribbage board will be sold at auction with some 800 other items from the same museum on October 20 and 21.

Cashing in: A similar, unconnected cribbage board would fetch £400- £600 but this could go for a lot more

Cribbage
is thought to have been created by the English poet Sir John Suckling 
in the early 17th century, as a derivation of the game "noddy".

Updated: Today's cribbage boards tend to be made of wood

While noddy has disappeared, cribbage has survived, virtually unchanged.

Cribbage in England is primarily a 
pub game and is one of the few games allowed by Statute to be played in a
public house for small stakes.

Also know as 'crib', it is a card 
game traditionally for two players, that involves playing and grouping 
cards in combinations which gain points.

A board, such as that used by Nelson, is used on which to keep score. Although Nelson's board was made of bone, today they are more commonly made on wood.

The objective of the game is to be the first player to score a target number of points, typically 61 or 121.

Points are scored for card combinations that add up to fifteen, and for pairs, triples, quadruples, runs, and flushes.

Players choose the order in which 
to lay their cards in order to maximize their score; experienced players
refer to this as either good or poor 'pegsmanship'.

If one player reaches the target (usually 61 or 121), the game ends immediately and that player wins. To reach that point is known as 'to peg out', which was origin of the same phrase meaning to die.
