The ‘Juncker bounce’ has propelled the Tories ahead of Labour in the polls, as voters backed David Cameron’s bid to block Euro-fanatic Jean-Claude Juncker from the EU’s top job.

The Tories have taken the lead with 33 per cent support – up five points in a week and two clear of Ed Miliband’s party on 31 per cent, according to yesterday’s poll.

Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative deputy chairman whose polling organisation conducts the weekly survey, said the Prime Minister’s  outspoken but doomed protest was behind the surge in popularity.

The boost for Mr Cameron came as angry senior Tories branded European allies ‘liars’, ‘turncoats’ and ‘cowards’ for failing to stick to their initial opposition to Mr Juncker, who was installed as European Commission president on Friday.

Mr Cameron came closer to suggesting he would recommend a ‘no’ vote in a referendum on EU membership if he fails to claw back powers from Brussels before 2017.

‘I will always do what’s in the national interest,’ the Prime Minister told the Commons. He conceded that renegotiating a looser, more trade-based relationship with Brussels would be harder with Mr Juncker at the helm, but insisted he still believed it would be achievable.

Though Labour also opposed Mr Juncker, Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron had demonstrated not ‘splendid isolation’ but ‘utter humiliation’ after being out-voted by 26 to 2 on the question of his candidacy.

‘You returned to Britain on Friday having failed. Not some mild, small failure, but an appalling failure of relationship-building, winning support and delivering for Britain,’ he said.

The Conservatives have jumped to five points ahead of Labour in the latest Lord Ashcroft poll. 1,006 adults were  interviewed by telephone between 27¿29 June 2014

But the Prime Minister branded Mr Miliband ‘weak, opportunistic and wrong’.

‘I have to say I won’t take lectures on negotiation from the people who gave away the veto, who gave away the rebate, who backed down on the budget every year, and who even signed us up to euro bailouts,’ Mr Cameron said.

He was particularly scathing about Labour’s decision to sign away Britain’s right to block a candidate for European Commission president in the Nice Treaty of 2001, meaning the issue is now settled by a majority vote.

‘I believe the council could have found a candidate who commanded the support of every member state – that has been the practice on every previous occasion and I think it was a mistake to abandon this approach this time,’ he said.

‘I insisted the European Council took a formal vote, something which doesn’t usually happen.

‘Facing the prospect of being outvoted, some might have swallowed their misgivings and gone with  the flow, but I believe it was important to push the principle and our deep misgivings about this issue right to the end.’

Despite the Conservatives being ahead in the voting intention, 32 per cent want a Labour government against 25 per cent favouring a Tory government in 2015

Mr Cameron said it was a ‘bad day for Europe’ which risked undermining national parliaments, but welcomed the decision to review the process the next time the position becomes vacant. He won strong support from the Tory backbenches.

Former minister Stephen O’Brien said: ‘In a previous Battle of Britain, we saw off many Junkers.’

Sir Bill Cash said the Prime Minister had been ‘completely right’ in his approach to Mr Juncker’s appointment. Tory MP Margot James said Mr Juncker was a ‘marked man’ after the events of recent days.

Senior allies of Angela Merkel  yesterday insisted a British exit from the EU would be a ‘disaster’.

German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble, regarded as Mrs Merkel’s  closest ally, said the UK was ‘indispensable’ to the EU and that everything should be done to ensure the country remained a member state.

‘The EU without the UK is absolutely  not acceptable – unimaginable,’ he told the Financial Times.

Dr Michael Fuchs, a leading member of Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats, told the BBC: ‘It would be a disaster if Britain is going to step out of the EU in Brussels. I cannot imagine an EU without Britain.’

Tory MPs shouted ‘because they’re liars’ when Mr Miliband asked why German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other EU leaders who were initially resistant to Mr Juncker’s candidacy had changed their minds.

Peter Lilley, a Eurosceptic former Cabinet minister who is one of several senior Tories tipped as Britain’s next EU commissioner, praised Mr Cameron for ‘not turning tail while our so-called allies were turning coats’.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt attacked the ‘cowardice’ of ‘other leaders who weren’t prepared to stand up in public and say the things they had said in private’. Lord Ashcroft said Mr Cameron’s approach appeared to have resonated with voters.

‘The poll was taken between Friday afternoon and Sunday evening, when political news was dominated by David Cameron’s stance against the appointment of the new European Commission president.’

A separate ComRes poll commissioned by ITV News found that the proportion of Britons who would vote for the UK to stay in the EU has fallen by four percentage points in a week.

The figure has dropped to 36 per cent, while 43 per cent would vote for Britain to leave the EU.

Few voters believe any of the main party leaders come across as ‘someone like me’, according to a new poll.

A ComRes survey found that Ukip leader Nigel Farage was seen as a kindred spirit by only 14 per cent of voters, just ahead of Ed Miliband on 13 per cent, David Cameron on 12 per cent and Nick Clegg on 8 per cent.

The Prime Minister is viewed as the most intelligent, statesman-like political leader in Britain, while the Ukip leader is the weirdest and most stupid.
