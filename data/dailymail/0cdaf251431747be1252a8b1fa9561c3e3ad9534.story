Lying at the water's edge the grey seals allow waves to break over them as they take a well-earned rest from hunting for fish

The seals live on the Island of Heligoland, 30 miles off the German coast in the North Sea.

It is famed for its wildlife and grey seals gather there to mate, give birth and bring up their young.

Keen wildlife photographerEimar Weiss, 44, travelled from his home in Hamburg and spent an entire day photographing the seals in the breakwater.

Mr Weiss, a dental technician, said: 'Enjoying the bubble bath lasted up to one hour.

'Mating, giving birth, feeding their young and hunting for fish is exhausting for the seals. Some grey seals rested on the beach and some in the breakwater - it certainly seemed they were enjoying this.

'It was very windy with wind speeds of around 40mph.

'I focused on the seals in the surf because of the crazy splashes. Foam does not behaves like pure water, it's just fascinating.

'You can't see this effect with your own eyes, but you can freeze it in a photo.

This seal might find it difficult to navigate to the next stop-off as it has its face completely covered by foam

'It's not easy to get such shots, you have to be very patient. Not every wave is strong enough, not every wave produced enough bubbles sometimes the sun disappears behind clouds, the seal turns away from the camera and so on.

'I love that it's looks like a bubble bath and the seals seem to enjoy it.

'I like the foam splashes and the warm colours from the sunlight and the sharpness and details of the pictures.'

Mr Weiss says Heligoland is a 'must-visit' location for a keen wildlife photographer such as himself.

Not every wave produces bubbles, but thankfully these seals were in luck as they enjoyed a good old soak

He added: 'From mid-November until mid-January the grey seals are giving birth. It's amazing to see the baby seals, they are so cute.

'Most of the photos shows a female grey seal, they are a lot smaller than the males and also more colourful.

'After giving birth, the female has to lactate the baby for one month. In this time, the baby seal is not able to swim because its fur is not yet water resistant.

'The female often stays near her baby on the beach or in the dunes, sometimes she is going in the sea to hunt for her own.

'Gestation period for a grey seal is 11 and a half months and after giving birth they are mating again.

'The mating male protected the female against other males and is always nearby.'
