Talented musician: Frances Andrade, 48, received psychiatric help only weeks before the trial

A concert violinist was urged by police not to seek counselling before she gave evidence in court against a choirmaster who sexually abused her as a teenager - in case it altered her memory, a coroner heard today.

The inquest into the death of Frances Andrade - who died of an overdose - was told that the talented musician increasingly struggled to cope with depression and anxiety in the year ahead of the trial of ex-choirmaster Michael Brewer.

Mrs Andrade died at her home in Guildford, Surrey, in January 2013, just a week after giving evidence in court about the historic sexual abuse, which came to light when her friend reported it to Surrey Police two years earlier.

Known as Fran, she was aged just 14 and 15 at the time of the abuse.

The mother-of-four had regular meetings with her GPs, who eventually referred her to the local health authority Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Trust’s Community Mental Health Recovery Service after she took multiple overdoses, Woking Coroner’s Court heard today.

But two overdoses in October and December 2012 preceded the first meeting the 48-year-old had with a psychiatrist on December 19 of that year - just weeks before she would have to face her abuser at Manchester Crown Court.

She had been in hospital at least four times for treatment following overdoses before health services regarded her as high risk.

Her GP Mary Morrison, of St Luke’s Surgery, Guildford, said Mrs Andrade’s anxiety stemmed from the impending court appearance and they were both frustrated with delays in getting psychiatric help.

‘Four months before the trial, Fran wanted something pragmatic, something here and now that related more to the court case than her past experiences,’ Mrs Morrison said.

‘It was becoming more and more difficult for her as that approached. In our conversation on December 10 we were both frustrated. We could not understand what was taking so long - she needed help.

‘It had been five or six weeks since the referral and she still did not have a care co-ordinator - it was a month to the court case and it was important Fran had this therapy.’

'She said [the] police didn’t not feel she should have counselling in case it interfered with her memories of the events and could obstruct the criminal case'

The inquest heard she again tried to take her own life on January 3, 2013.

Dr Alastair Bint, also of St Luke’s, was Mrs Andrade’s GP in 2011 when she first reported anxiety over the abuse and said she took several overdoses after the press first reported the case in mid-2012.

Dr Bint said: ‘I remember this consultation like it was yesterday because it was so unusual. Mrs Andrade came in and immediately burst into tears.

‘I remember sitting there for a couple of minutes in silence and let her cry and offered her tissues. Then she found the confidence to speak and told me what it was all about.

Mrs Andrade allegedly said she felt as though she had been the one on trial during cross-examination by her abuser's counsel Kate Blackwell QC (above)

‘It was about the fact historical sexual abuse acts she had shut away for many years had been reopened. I remember her feeling helpless, she didn’t know what to do.

‘I remember it was not her choice. It had been reopened by a friend of hers who had reported it to the police and the police had contacted her. I remember her saying it not had been her choice to have this case reopened.’

He told the inquest he started seeing her fortnightly, adding: ‘I broached with her the offer of a psychiatric referral but she was resistant to that.

‘She said the reason why was the police didn’t not feel she should have counselling in case it interfered with her memories of the events and could obstruct the criminal case.

‘I felt her mental health was more important than the criminal case, but she was not persuaded.’

On Monday Mrs Andrade’s husband Levine Andrade, 59, said in his evidence that his wife told him she felt as though she had been the one on trial during cross-examination by her abuser’s counsel Kate Blackwell QC.

Brewer, who taught at the prestigious Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester before going on to direct the World Youth Choir, was later stripped of his OBE for music services after being jailed for six years for five counts of indecent assault.

In April, a serious case review by Surrey Safeguarding Adults Board said Mrs Andrade’s death ‘could and should’ have been prevented and mental health services failed to recognise she was vulnerable as she made repeated suicide bids.

Her death led to calls for the court system to improve how sexual abuse victims are treated. The inquest is scheduled to run into next week.
