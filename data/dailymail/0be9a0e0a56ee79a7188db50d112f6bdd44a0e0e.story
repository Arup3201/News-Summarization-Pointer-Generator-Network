The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has pocketed nearly £25million in five years selling sensitive personal details of millions of motorists to controversial parking enforcement firms.

The government quango passed on the private information of 8.7million drivers to dozens of companies so they could be pursued relentlessly over alleged unpaid fines.

The latest twist in the ‘cowboy’ parking scandal shows the agency even divulged names and addresses of innocent people to ‘rogue firms’ that they knew had been convicted of criminal offences.

The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency has pocketed nearly £25million in five years selling sensitive personal details of millions of motorists to controversial parking enforcement firms

The Mail, which highlighted the outrage during the summer, has demanded action after revealing the practice had turned into a multi-million-pound industry dubbed ‘legalised mugging’ by motoring groups.

According to the DVLA, which holds details of all registered vehicle keepers in the UK, the amount it collected from parking firms more than doubled from £2.9million in 2010-11 to £6million in 2013-14.

So far this year, it has raked in £4.3million from the lucrative private parking business and forecasts this will rise to £7.3million by the end of March 2015. That would make a total of £24.7million.

Details are sold at £2.50 a time, often to firms levying parking charges on drivers using privately-owned car parks at NHS hospitals, supermarkets, shopping centres and even tourist attractions.

The increase in income from parking companies seeking drivers’ details follows the ban on clamping, introduced in October 2012, and a change in the law which allows parking operators to pursue motorists for the payment of tickets rather than having to identify the driver at the time.

Official DVLA figures reveal 31 companies have paid for personal data, despite several receiving stinging criticism – and even criminal convictions – over their behaviour.

Observices Parking Consultancy, for instance, spent more than £66,000 buying sensitive information of more than 20,000 motorists.

Yet the firm and one of its directors had pleaded guilty in March 2011 to breaching trading standards by being ‘recklessly unfair’.

The company, which operated in Wolverhampton, admitted 36 offences, including displaying 15 misleading signs at and sending letters from a debt recovery firm without revealing it was the same company as OPC.

Meanwhile, Parking Eye, which has forked out more than £7million in five years, lost a court battle this year after trying to fine a motorist £100 for circling a car park - without stopping.

Dave Hotchin, 49, spent half an hour waiting for a space without success before driving away from Fistral Beach car park in Newquay, Cornwall.

Tory MP Michael Ellis said he was ‘worried’ about how the DVLA was selling drivers’ details

But two months later he received a demand for £100 saying the couple had been caught without a ticket by an automatic number plate reader.

Parking Eye sent four further warnings to Mr Hotchin and his wife before launching a court action to get the money, but the judge threw out the claim because the pair had never parked.

Tory MP Michael Ellis, who in 2011 supported the ban on private wheel clampers and sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said he was ‘worried’ about how the DVLA was selling drivers’ details.

He said: ‘They have raked in a fortune. I think the DVLA has a duty and a responsibility to make sure they protect the personal and private information that they hold.

‘Part of that responsibility is to ensure they don’t give details to unscrupulous firms who make the lives of innocent motorists a misery and who should not be trusted with it. The DVLA must urgently review its practices.

In the summer, the Daily Mail has revealed the aggressive tactics used by firms to coerce hundreds of thousands of drivers into paying inflated charges.

Parking squads issue official-looking £100 tickets, often to drivers just a few minutes late returning to their cars.

Rogue wardens working on hospital grounds have allegedly been ordered to focus on cancer wards because patients are likely to be distracted – and therefore late returning to their cars.

Private parking companies also hit hundreds of thousands of drivers with ‘fines’ for minor infringements outside shops and fast-food chains.

After issuing so-called penalty notices, they then use threats to terrify motorists into paying up.

The campaign prompted Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to warn ‘bully boy’ tactics would not be tolerated and rogue firms could be prosecuted.

The DVLA insisted it has strict of criteria for those using its electronic database, including valid data protection registration, probation periods and audits to monitor behaviour and use of data.

The agency also denied profiting from the sale of personal information. It said: ‘The fees are set to recover the related administrative costs and this means that it is the applicant and not the taxpayer who funds this activity.

‘Landowners would have great difficulty in enforcing their rights if motorists were able to park with impunity on private property.

‘If it is alleged that the terms of the contract are breached, it is considered reasonable that vehicle keeper details may be released in order to enable the landowner or his agent the opportunity to pursue their legal rights.

‘If this were not the case, motorists would be able to park with disregard for the law or the rights of landowners, with no prospect of being held to account for their actions.’
