Alan Pardew admits he feared losing the one he loves — midfielder Cheick Tiote.

Newcastle travel to Stoke’s Britannia Stadium on Monday night with Tiote having made a timely return to fitness for his under-fire boss.

The Ivorian, though, had his head turned by interest from Lokomotiv Moscow during the summer and was thought to be keen on a move to Russia.

Tiote remained on Tyneside after Lokomotiv failed to make an acceptable offer but, with his contract set to expire in 2016, Pardew is keen for talks to open over a new deal.

Asked if the interest had unsettled the 28-year-old, the Newcastle manager said: ‘Yes, for sure.

‘We obviously had a team fighting for his services, but the finance was never really in place.

‘I think his contract situation needs to be resolved at the end of the season, for sure.

‘I love him. He’s everything that you want in a Newcastle player.

‘He has the quality, and of course you’ll never underestimate the fact that he wants to win.

‘That’s something we have to be very careful about on training days!’

Pardew added: ‘I just love that he’s a winner. It can overcome so many obstacles as a footballer.

‘I think young players here need to take a big leaf out of his book in terms of how he approaches training and games.

‘Sometimes it can overspill into bookings and sendings off, but you can never fault him for wanting to win.’

If Pardew’s players have proved anything in the past 10 days it is that they’re behind their manager. A come-from-behind 2-2 draw with Hull followed by a 3-2 victory at Crystal Palace in the Capital One Cup showed as much. 

And he believes his vice-captain Tiote and skipper Fabricio Coloccini have set the standard.

‘You do need big players at this football club,’ Pardew went on, his position having been made safe in the short term at least.

‘Colo and Tiote are two very important players for us. They showed that on Wednesday night and last Saturday.

‘They have the fight and the quality. You can’t fight your way to a Premier League win — you have to play. They’ve got that balance right.’

Stoke manager Mark Hughes has laughed off Manchester City counterpart Manuel Pellegrini’s comments claiming his side are a ‘small team’.

Describing the match with Chelsea, Pellegrini said: ‘It was very similar to the Stoke team, with a big team playing against a small team with very good players, trying to defend, trying to keep the score (0-0).’

Hughes said: ‘He was possibly disappointed with the way Chelsea approached the game but we didn’t take any umbrage with it, as criticism of ourselves.’ 

Hughes has no fresh injury concerns, with only midfielder Jonathan Walters a doubt with a calf problem.
