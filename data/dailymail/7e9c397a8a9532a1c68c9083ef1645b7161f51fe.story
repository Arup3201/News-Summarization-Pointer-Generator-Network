Host commentator

It's advantage Barcelona going in to the return leg and Luis Enrique side deserved their 1-0 victory.

The home side were the only team trying to win the match as Atletico defended with 10 men behind the ball for the entire 90 minutes.

Simeone almost escaped with the draw and clean sheet he wanted, but Atleti's resistance was finally broken in the closing stages.

The tie remains delicately poised but you would fancy Barcelona to score an away goal when the sides meet at the Vicente Calderon.

 

It's all over.

Barcelona take a slender lead into the second leg at Vicente Calderon.

 

Godin will miss the second leg through suspension after bringing down Messi on the edge of the area.

The Argentine gets the ball up and over the wall, but over the bar too.

After holding firm for 85 minutes, can Atletico salvage a precious away goal in stoppage time?

They have shown no attacking intent for the whole of this half, remember.

Barclona finally make the breakthrough, but needed a bit of luck to breach the Atletico defence.

There was contact form Juanfran on Busquets but the Barcelona midfielder went down easily.

It was a fantastic save by Oblak but the ball rebounded perfectly to Messi to tuck into the empty net.

Somewhere among the commotion of the penalty Atletico midfielder Gabi is shown a yellow card. 

Messi's penalty is saved by Oblak with a strong hand to his left.

But the ball drops perfectly for Messi in the six-yard box and the forward couldn't miss.

Barcelona take the lead with just over five minutes to play.

Messi fired a free kick straight into the wall.

Busquets picked the ball up and goes down under a challenge from Juanfan. Referee gives it.

Javier Mascherano is shown a yellow card for dissent after the referee gives Barcelona a free kick for handball.

The Barcelona defender was angry with the official for failing to give a similar decision moments earlier.

Barcelona turn to midfield maestro Xavi in an attempt to cut through this formidable Ateltico defence.

Luis Suarez went to ground under a challenge from Diego Godin as the Barcelona forward tries to latch on to a through pass.

The referee waves away the appeals, however.

Former Liverpool striker Suarez is incensed with the decision.

Andres Iniesta tests the handling of Oblak with a decent strike form the edge of the area.

But it was a simple save down to his left for the Atletico keeper.

Messi unable to work his magic yet as Barcelona continue to struggle to create anything of note.

Not one for the purists, but Atletico should be applauded for the type of defensive performance that has become a hallmark of Simeone's team.

The away side are quite brilliantly squeezing the life out of this game as we head into the final 20 minutes.

The end of the night for Greizmann as he is taken off and replaced by Raul Garcia with 25 minutes to play.

Some neat bulid up play between Neymar and Iniesta ends with later attempting a strike from the edge of the box.

But Koke threw his body in the way and the ball deflected kindly into the grateful arms of Oblak.

Barcelona continuing to probe, but without much luck.

The Atletico defence is continuing to hold firm as they successfully repel wave after wave of Barcelona attack.

The game is almost like a training game but the attacking side are failing to break through a sturdy defence.

Simeone's side are working tirelessly without the ball and Oblak has remained untroubled since the interval.

The pattern of the first half has continued in much the same fashion.

Barcelona dominating possession and making all the attacking moves as Atletico soak up the pressure and try to hit the Catalans on the break.

Messi looking dangerous every time he gets the ball. The Argentine was just halted by a strong body-check, but the referee plays on.

Barcelona have averaged nearly four goals a game at the Nou Camp this season.

It looks as though they will have to produce something special to break down the Atletico defence tonight, however.

Barcelona get the game back under way.

Mario Mandzukic has replace Fernando Torres at half time.

The first half ends goalless at the Nou Camp with this Copa del Rey quater-final first leg delicately poised.

Barcelona have been frustrated by Atleti, who have defended deep with 10 men behind the ball.

But Luis Enrique's side should be ahead. First Messi fired over from 12 yards before Suarez missed a gilt-edged chance from the edge of the six yard box.

Atletico have tried to play on the break but have been wasteful in possession, but Simeone will be the happier of the two managers at the break.

Atletico continue to be wasteful in possession.

Simeone's side have offered next to nothing in terms of an attacking threat.

'Suarez done from behind by Godin. No action from referee. And to cofound his frustration he misses from five yards. "Suarez! Suarez! Suarez!" sing the Camp Nou.'

The ball fell kindly to Fernando Torres who was one on one with Gerrard Pique.

Greizmann joined the former Chelsea striker in the attack but Torres could only find the heel of Pique as he attempted to slide it through.

Not sure how much the centre back knew about the interception.

Barcelona should be ahead.

A delightful first-time volleyed pass from Rakitic found Luis Suarez six yards out.

But the striker could only fire a volley over the bar. He really should have scored.

Barcelona are being crowded out in the final third as Atletico defend deep with everyone behind the ball.

Every time on e of the Barca attackers get near the box he is accompanied by two or three Atleti players.

Atletico Madrid have their first shot on goal as the ball drops to Arda Turan after another free kick.

The midfielder doesn't catch the strike cleanly as Ter Stegen makes a comfortable save.

'Messi loitering with intent on the right for Barcelona and making a fool of left back Siqueira whenever he comes anywhere near him. Not seen too much of Atletico going forward Torres roundly jeered whenever he touches it - which from rival fans he'll gladly accept.'

Barcelona continue to enjoy the lions' share of possession but the home side haven't been able to create a meaningful chance.

Atleti have become more of an attacking force in the last five minutes.

A couple of corners and free kicks have eased the pressure on their back line.

The away side are having difficulty stringing three passes together in the opening 15 minutes.

Diego Simeone turns away in disgust as another pass goes astray.

Rakitic picked out Messi in the area with a smart cut-back.

The Argentine takes one touch before volleying over the bar.

It was a difficult chance on his right foot, but Messi should have hit the target.

Luis Enrique's side have settled into the game well. Barcelona enjoying most of the possession as you would expect.

Messi, Neymar and Iniesta are popping the ball about nicely in the final third as Atletico sit deep.

Neymar sent a curling effort towards the far right corner of the Atletico goal but Oblak tipped the ball wide of the post. It was a great effort by the Brazilian but the Atleti keeper was equal to it.

The resulting corner is cleared away.

Atleti midfielder Koke has the game's first shot but can only lash a volley high and wide after the ball dropped to him on the edge of the area.

Tonight's referee Mr Jose Luis Gonzalez Gonzalez will need to be in two places at once after the game two weeks ago produced nine yellows and a penalty.

Kick-off just minutes away now.

Moya Rumbo, Raúl García, Mandzuki, Jiménez, Ñíguez, Gámez, Giménez de Vargas

Masip, Xavi, Pedro, Rafinha, Bartra, Roberto, Adriano

Kick-off is just over 10 minutes away at the Nou Camp.

'Fernando Torres has eight goals in 12 games against Barça. He loves a goal at the Camp Nou, scored here for Chelsea too. The other former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez tonight faces two Uruguayan team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez.'

Oblak; Juanfran, Miranda, Godín, Siqueira; Mario, Gabi, Koke, Arda; Torres, Griezmann

Ter Stegen; Alves, Piqué, Mascherano, Alba; Rakitic, Busquets, Iniesta; Luis Suárez, Messi, Neymar
