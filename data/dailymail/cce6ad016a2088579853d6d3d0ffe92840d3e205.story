Floral tributes for the Sydney siege victims are being removed and a marquee erected ahead of a forecast for rain.

Notes, messages and cards will be preserved when the existing blanket of flowers at Martin Place is composted on Tuesday.

Parts of the tribute for Lindt cafe manager Tori Johnson, 34, and barrister Katrina Dawson, 38, will remain under a marquee.

The flowers will be composted and used as fertiliser at a future site in tribute to mother-of-three Ms Dawson and  Mr Johnson.

The weather forecast for Sydney on Tuesday is a high chance of showers with chances of thunderstorms in the afternoon and early evening.

NSW Premier Mike Baird said that the Australian government had been in contact with London and Boston, cities which have both housed large-scale floral memorial sites, for advice on how to transport and reconstitute the flowers. 

The removal of parts of the memorial has been designed to preserve the messages and not to discourage people from paying their respects at Martin Place, a spokeswoman for the NSW premier said.

An army of volunteers from the Red Cross, Rural Fire Service and State Emergency Service will help collect the flowers while chaplains remain to counsel visitors.

Condolence books will also be available at the Sydney Opera House and NSW Parliament House until the end of January.

They will be bound in several volumes and the Johnson and Dawson families will each receive a copy.

A permanent memorial will be discussed with the families once they are ready.

The Premier confirmed that the government had been in contact with London to find out how authorities in the city composted the ten of thousands of flowers left at memorial sites after the death of Princess Diana in 1997, reported The Daily Telegraph. 

The tens of thousands of flowers placed at the Martin Place memorials sites expanded quickly after the first bouquet was left on Tuesday morning, and in light of the continual flow of tributes, the Premier confirmed that the flowers would be preserved and 'clean composted' for a future site to preserve the memory of public compassion and support.

'The NSW Government is in contact with authorities in London and Boston regarding flowers, tributes notes and condolence books to ensure we are operating on prior international best practice.'

A single bunch of white roses left resting on a pole when the siege ended at 2.15am on Tuesday has sparked the beginning of a makeshift shrine that has now grown to take over a large portion of Martin Place.

Thousands of people continue to flock to the area a week later to pay tribute to the victims, including Mr Johnson and mother of three Katrina Dawson who were both killed after being held hostage for more than 16 hours.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, Premier Mike Baird and Australia's Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove travelled to the site to pay their respects to those who had lost their lives and the 15 other hostages who were terrorised by Man Haron Monis.

The death of Princess Diana touched the UK public in a manner which authorities had not anticipated, with images of the floral tributes left to honour her memory circulating the globe.

On the eve of her funeral, the number of flower bouquet's reached one million, and her family requested that flowers stop being laid outside her family home as they had become a 'threat to public safety'.

After the Boston bombings, bouquets left on Bolyson Street where the tragic attack happened formed a makeshift memorials which spread rapidly.

Mourners left thousands of floral bouquets and notes, and well as running shoes, T-shirts, flags, hats, near the finish line of the marathon where the two bombs went off.

Friends and family members of the victims, as well as members of the Australian public and government have laid not only flowers, but notes, sentimental items, and drawings in honour of the victims.

NSW Premier Mike Baird says a permanent memorial will be erected in Martin Place when the time is right.

'This is something that will be with us forever. We need to recognise that and pay tribute to the inspiring Australians that we have lost, and what they have given us,' he told Macquarie Radio.

'They've given us something so special which is this unprecedented bond of togetherness and strength in the face of adversity.'

Standing in front of the sea of flowers, Mr Baird said the city and state was coming together like never before.

'My heart is beating louder and prouder because of what we are seeing,' he told Sky News.

Mr Baird says the outpouring of emotion is remarkable.

'I've seen a four-year-old through to a 75-year-old, people from different faiths and backgrounds ... putting flowers down, all united. It's an outpouring of grief, but at the same time it's almost this unprecedented unity,' he told the Seven Network.

'It is a healing process, but it shows this city is back.'\

Financial donations in memory of the two victims have been directed to mental health organisation beyondblue and The Katrina Dawson Foundation.
