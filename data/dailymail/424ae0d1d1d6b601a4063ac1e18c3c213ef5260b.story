While some dogs spend their time chasing their tails, jumping for balls or even getting confused at their own reflection, Denzil has a different obsession.

For the young Miniature Pinscher cross appears to think he is a meerkat.

Denzil spends his days walking on his hind legs, trying to get a better view of the world from his tiny stature.

The one-year-old dog was rescued earlier this year and has been dubbed Meerkat by workers at Mayhew Animal Home, in North West London.

His enthusiasm for walking on his hind legs, as well as stretching his neck to impossible heights has also earned the animal the nickname ET.

He is able to walk on his hind legs for around 30 seconds and appears to particularly favour the walk when crossing roads - drawing the attention of many members of the public. 

Denzil's new owner Stephan Grothgar said: 'Denzil was a true rescue dog having been found in Denzil Road last May.

'Despite being short of stature Denzil is very inquisitive and likes to get up with the action. 

'We have dubbed him 'The Meerkat' because of the way he walks.

'He can get onto his hind legs and stretch to what seems double his length.

Even his neck seems to triple in length almost a bit like E.T. as well.'

Denzil is known for his being nosey, which sees him walking around on his hind legs when the mood takes him

Raffy Hamid, from the Mayhew Animal Home, said Denzil's antics had made him very popular. 

She said: 'He seems to do it whenever the mood takes him, I saw him do it for about 30 secs when he crossed the road.

'He is pint sized. He walks on his hind legs to get a better look at the world and when he wants to see something because he is so small.' 

Denzil was found last May and taken in by the rescue centre. He has now been adopted by Mr Grothgar, an artist and actor.
