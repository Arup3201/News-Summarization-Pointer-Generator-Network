Mesut Ozil was beamed across the giant screens inside Dortmund’s big yellow box of noise before the game. He had been given an electronic makeover, tendons lit up in green to give him a robotic, other-worldly feel.

It was part of an advert for a new adidas 'Predator' boot. A predator? Not really. It will take more than a few fancy sci-fi graphics to turn Ozil into a predator. It is not his style. He has not scored a goal for Arsenal since April. He has never scored away from home for the club.

Out of this world? Not really. Robotic? Not in a good way.

'Instinct Takes Over' promised adidas. But inertia took hold. The game kicked off and Arsenal froze. Little more than an hour later, Ozil was replaced by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain with the Londoners already two down.

During that time he had never quite got to the pace of the game. It was not only Ozil. In fairness, other high-profile team-mates were struggling to cope; overwhelmed by the frenetic tempo and intensity of Dortmund.

Arsenal could not get the controlled possession in midfield which might allow Ozil or Alexis Sanchez to sparkle. But there are times when you look to the big players to produce something special to change the rhythm of the game.

Sanchez has done it at times this season. Ozil has not. Arsene Wenger must have hoped this would be the occasion when his £42.5million record produced him a flash of magic to give his team a grip on a difficult game.

Last season, when Ozil was faltering after a promising start in north London, Wenger claimed this would be the season when he came into his own.

He would, the manager claimed, be the Player of the Year. However, there are no signs his Arsenal career is about to transform. He is drifting down the path of Juan Sebastian Veron, unquestionably gifted but perhaps not cut out for the way an English team want to play.

Who wants a play-maker who cannot influence the game? At some point soon, the Arsenal boss must consider whether to cut his losses. Does he reshape his team to play him in a more central position? Or drop him. Is he better off with Oxlade-Chamberlain or Santi Cazorla? He is certainly not short of options in this position.

Such a move may damage Ozil’s confidence. Or it may jolt him into life. It must be worth a try. He was not inspired by his return to his native Ruhr Valley, down the road from Gelsenkirchen where he was born and bred. Instead, he suffered another night of anonymity.

For most of the first-half, he could be found on the right wing, with teenager Hector Bellerin making his first start for the club behind him at right-back.

Bellerin’s accelerated promotion was the result of a sequence of minor mishaps which regularly seem to befall Wenger’s squad and he could probably done with someone slightly more industrious and protective ahead of him. That was Wenger’s choice.

Germany seem to get by with Ozil on the wing. They won the World Cup with him there. Perhaps they have more defensive solidity elsewhere to compensate. Arsenal are fragile and, in Dortmund, many of the early problems from the areas occupied (or not) by Ozil and Bellerin.

The defensive shift is not his strength. So, perhaps, he could turn the game with a waft of his left boot. There were neat touches, as ever. When Wenger claimed at the weekend, after a draw against Manchester City, that Ozil’s class shines through when he studies a replay of the game.

He alluded to the weight of his pass and his decision making. There was one moment in the 18th minute, when he slid a low cross unerringly to Danny Welbeck in the penalty box, but it came to nothing. There was a delicious long-range pass to Sanchez, who had drifted offside.

At times, he made the difficult things look easy. At other times, he made the easy things look difficult. Ozil was not the reason Arsenal lost in Dortmund but his inability to influence the game is becoming a problem Wenger has to address.
