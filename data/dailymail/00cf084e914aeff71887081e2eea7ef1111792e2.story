An SAS hero jailed for keeping an Iraqi pistol as a war trophy said he was ‘elated’ yesterday after his conviction was quashed.

Sniper Danny Nightingale, an ‘exemplary’ soldier, who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan, was initially sentenced to 18 months for illegally possessing the weapon and ammunition.

But yesterday the Court of Appeal heard how he had been ‘improperly pressured’ into pleading guilty.

A military judge had told him he would face five years in a civilian jail if he fought the case and lost, the appeal court heard, despite evidence that he was suffering from memory loss and had forgotten about the gun.

Taking on the justice system: SAS sniper Danny Nightingale outside the High Court in London with his wife Sally where his conviction for illegally possessing a firearm was overturned

Sgt Nightingale, 38, was later freed 
after judges cut his sentence following a vigorous campaign led by his 
wife Sally, father Humphrey and support from newspapers, including the 
Daily Mail.

Yesterday he clenched his wife’s hand as he listened to Lord
Chief Justice Lord Judge quash the conviction, saying the original 
judge had ‘improperly narrowed’ his freedom of choice when he decided to
plead guilty.

Sgt Nightingale now faces a retrial. 
But even if convicted, the worst he could receive is a suspended 
sentence, meaning he will not return to jail.

Outside court the father of two said: ‘There will be a few bubbles tonight. I think we deserve them.'

Legal battle: Sgt Nightingale was sentenced to 18 months military detention in early November after admitting illegally possessing a Glock 9mm pistol and more than 300 rounds of ammunition

‘I wouldn’t wish my family’s experience on my worst enemy.

‘Without the effort of my family, my 
legal team, the Press, we wouldn’t be where we are.

'We will attack the 
retrial with the same vigour and tenacity that we have done with this.’

He said he hoped to return to service ahead of his retrial but said that decision would be for the Ministry of Defence.

The court heard that the 9mm Glock 
pistol was a gift from Iraqi soldiers he had helped to train.

The 
soldier, from Crewe in Cheshire, intended to pass the gun to his 
regiment to be decommissioned and displayed as a war trophy.

But he forgot about it after suffering
‘significant’ brain damage that affected his memory when he  collapsed 
on a charity trek in the Brazilian jungle.

The Glock and 338 rounds of ammunition
were found when police raided his rented home in Hereford last year, 
following a dispute between his housemate and the housemate’s estranged 
wife.

Sgt Nightingale pleaded guilty to two charges at a court martial 
last November and was sent to the  Military Corrective Training Centre 
in Colchester.

But the Appeal Court heard yesterday 
that the judge advocate who presided over his court martial had given a 
‘direct wink’ to Sgt Nightingale that if he was convicted after pleading
not guilty, he would face five years in jail.

‘That is a message that should never have come from the bench,’ William Clegg QC, for Sgt Nightingale, told the hearing.

Mr Clegg said Sgt Nightingale felt he 
faced the prospect of a ‘very lengthy separation’ from his wife and 
daughters Alys, two, and Mara, five, if he lost the case.

Lord Judge, sitting with Mr Justice 
MacKay and Mr Justice Sweeney, ruled: ‘It seems abundantly clear that 
the judge advocate was in fact giving an uninvited sentence indication.

‘The defendant’s freedom of choice was improperly narrowed.’

After the ruling, Mrs Nightingale said she had ‘mixed emotions’.

‘I’m relieved the convictions have been quashed. But it’s still not over,’ she said.

2007: Sgt Nightingale, serving in Iraq, is presented with a Glock pistol as a gift.

He returns to the UK in November 2007, accompanying the bodies of two of his closest friends killed in a helicopter crash.

His equipment is packed by colleagues, and the pistol - inside a container - is sent first to the SAS regimental headquarters in Hereford, then to his home where it remains unopened until 2010.

2009: Sgt Nightingale collapses during a fundraising trek in Brazil, falling into a coma. He recovers but his memory is severely damaged, according to two experts.

2010: West Mercia Police discover the Glock at the house he shares with another soldier.
