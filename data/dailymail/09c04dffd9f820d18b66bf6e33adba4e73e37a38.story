A man who dumped a girlfriend he met online claims she portrayed his new fiancee as a drug-addicted tramp by creating sexually explicit profiles using altered pictures from social-media sites.

Emmanuil Sadikov filed a $5 million lawsuit in Brooklyn, New York, against the woman and three others, who he claims created the pages to smear his bride-to-be, Evelina Elterman.

The group allegedly took photos of Miss Elterman and merged them with sexually explicit images of other women, according to the New York Post.

They then sent the profiles, which were mainly listed on Russian dating websites, to the couple's friends and family.

A source told the 
paper that Sadikov had an online relationship with one of the 
alleged tormentors, but when he ended it, she copied pictures of 
Elterman and created the ugly profiles.

The couple managed to get some of the profiles taken down but there are still some pages which remain active.

The lawsuit says the profiles were created by Izabella and Khananiya Avshman along with Florida and Seymond Fishkin who used Elterman’s photos and merged them with other nude images.

Izabella is also alleged to have told the couple last month that she would not stop the online hate campaign until 'her (Miss Elterman's) reputation is completely ruined'.

The court documents added: 'The defendants attempted and succeeded in alienating Emmanuil Sadikov’s friends and family.

'The nasty profiles and messages have destroyed Sadikov’s personal life and his real-estate business.'

'As a result of the defendant’s actions, plaintiffs friends and family have stopped talking to Emmanuel Sadikov and Evelina Elterman and Emmanuel Sadikov’s business associates have refused to conduct business with him.'

Sadikov and his attorney Stephen Dickerman declined to comment on the case..
