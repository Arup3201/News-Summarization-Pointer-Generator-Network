Former The Only Way is Essex star, Abi Clarke, 23, confessed about the six months of traumashe suffered following cosmetic procedures

Former The Only Way is Essex star, Abi Clarke, has spoken about the 'six months of hell' she experienced after undergoing a 10-minute lip filler procedure, which left her blistered and scarred.

Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain today, Abi, 23, confessed about the trauma she suffered following the procedure.

'A 10 minute quick fix turned into six months of hell,' she said.

'I went in for a an exfoliation and the person who did that for me could also do botox and fillers so they suggested to do that for me.'

Abi also admitted she hadn't done enough research into the beautician or the procedure.

'That's one thing I do regret,' she said.

'I can't stress enough - 100 per cent you need to look into where you're going and who you're seeing and if they're actually capable and professional enough to do that.'

Abi admitted that they made her lips go hard and split in the middle. 'It was like cement in my lip,' she said. 

'It was really painful and over time, over the six months, I got blisters and the scar tissue got really sore and there were ulcers so everything was reacting!'

Asked whether the ordeal has put her off cosmetic enhancements, Abi said: 'Definitely, 100 per cent I really have.'

The 23-year-old, who joined the reality TV show two years ago, said she felt under pressure to look perfect and decided to follow in the footsteps of fellow stars Amy Childs and Lauren Goodger. 

'When everyone looks amazing, you can think maybe I could do this, especially as some of the girls had work done. I asked them for advice,' she previously admitted when she appeared on Channel 4's Bodyshockers.

'I wasn't really thinking about the needles, just about the results,' she told TV presenter Katie Piper.

But the procedure didn't give her the look she'd hoped for after she had a bad reaction to the filler.

She explained: 'The filler reacted in my lips and I got a wedge of it that was pushing out on either side. I thought if my lips crack, that will be it, my face will be ruined for life.'

The swelling did subside but the lumps of filler remained making her lips look and feel uneven. 

'I regret how my lips are now, I can hide the lumps of filler with make up but it feels disgusting,'

She said: 'Now my lips are bruised and painful, I didn't realise how fake the filler would make me look. I have ruined my looks for nothing. I didn't really need them done.'

Explaining more about her motivation to have the injections, Abi said she thought having a fuller pout would boost her self-esteem. 

'I thought my lips were going to make me happy and the one thing that would give me that confidence - but it made me more upset,' she said. 'I have realised that confidence doesn't need to come from my lips, it needs to come from me. 

'I need to have the confidence to be myself and to not want to look like all the other celebrities.'

Abi's parents revealed on the documentary how they also wish their daughter hadn't 'ruined her face'.

Her father said: 'Her lips were fine as they were, no parent wants their child to be adjusting things. 

'Her lips don't look natural now, they look painful.'

Her mother agreed. She told Abi: 'It looks like a blow up dolly. It breaks my heart you had to do that as naturally you had lovely lips.'

In a bid to get back to her natural look, Abi arranged to have filler removal treatment while being followed by the Bodyshocker cameras.

This involveed having more injections in her lips to inject a chemical to break down the filler.

Despite the area being numbed first, Abi squealed in pain as the needle is inserted in her upper lip.

Dr Esho of Le Beau Ideal who carried out the reversal surgery on Abi said: 'Abi came to see me after a lip augmentation with dermal fillers had unfortunately gone terribly wrong. Dermal fillers carry real risk of cyst formation, infection, allergy and scarring and it's important to be aware of these as part of doing your research when seeking these procedures.

'Over several weeks I saw Abi in stages we worked to drain and remove deep cysts, free scar tissue and dissolve filler which had been misplaced.

'It was a painful process for her but she was been brave throughout, recovered well and is now looking better than ever.

'Cases like Abi's I see more and more, and it's important for patients to seek out the right qualified professional to undergo these procedures and not base their choice on cost. Finding a skilled professional you can trust Is priceless. They will always guide and help you and be there to help'you if things don't go as planned.'

Abi admitted the painful reversal treatments were worth it to rid her lips of the lumpy filler once and for all.

She said: 'I'm really happy, I feel so normal now but my lips will never be the same or as tight and nice as they once were.'

Abi said she'd learnt her lesson and doesn't intend to have any more cosmetic surgery for the foreseeable future.

'I'm embracing the natural look now,' she said.
