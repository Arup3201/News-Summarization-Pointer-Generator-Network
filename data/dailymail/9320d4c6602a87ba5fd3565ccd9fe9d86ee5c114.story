In a bid to reinvigorate its range of PCs, HP has unveiled a radical new design complete with a projector and 3D cameras.

Called HP Sprout, it combines a 23-inch touchscreen display with an interactive touch mat - in place of a standard keyboard and mouse.

A projector on top of the monitor  scans objects, and it can track a user’s hands when using a virtual keyboard below.

The PC is available for pre-order online in the US, before being released in stores on 9 November, and costs $1,899 (£1,180). More country release dates are yet to be announced.

HP's $1,899 (£1,180) Sprout PC (pictured) has a 23-inch touchscreen display with an interactive touch mat. A projector is fitted to the top of the monitor, known as the HP Illuminator, and the California-based firm calls the technology Blended Reality

The projector, dubbed the HP Illuminator, is fitted with Intel’s RealSense 3D technology, similar to Microsoft’s Kinect, and combines a 14.6MP camera, the projector itself, and an LED desk lamp.

This camera system means it is able to beam images on to the mat, but can also be used to scan physical objects.

This camera system means it is able to beam images on to the mat, but can also be used to scan physical objects. 

Once an object has been scanned, a virtual copy can be manipulated in 2D and 3D either on the touchscreen, or when beamed onto the mat using a stylus, or typical touchscreen controls such as pinch and swipe.

Users can also type onto the mat using a software-based keyboard because the cameras recognise 20 touches at one time.

HP Sprout runs on Windows 8.1, is powered by Intel’s i7 processor and comes with 1TB storage.

During the launch event, HP executives demonstrated how various items from pens and cups to figurines and pictures can be scanned, tacked onto existing images or video, edited then emailed or shared through social media.

And when a virtual keyboard is beamed onto the mat, the cameras can also track the location of fingers to plot what they type using its 20-point capacitive sensors.

‘We've been working for a number of years already. 

'We have patents going back more than 10 years,’ said project chief Ramon Pastor. 

‘We didn't want to introduce a product that wasn't a breakthrough.’

Eric Monsef, project leader, said the initial production run ‘will be modest but can be scaled up if needed’.

He said the key would be to attract developers for a new Sprout marketplace or apps store, for software that takes advantage of Sprout's 3D capabilities.

HP Sprout will launch with apps from Dreamworks Animation, Skype and Evernote. More will be added later.

‘It's about getting people excited again,’ said Mr Monself.

Additional country releases will be announced shortly.

In a departure for the company, HP also announced it will begin to share its 3D printing technology.

The technique, which the company claims can print 10 times faster and much cheaper than current products, will be shared with select manufacturing and technology partners to garner feedback before launching in 2016.

The company calls its technique ‘multi jet fusion’ because it uses a series of printing jets spraying multiple chemicals simultaneously.

It also claims it is cheaper than other commercially available technologies.

Once an object has been scanned, a virtual copy can be manipulated in 2D and 3D either on the touchscreen, or on the mat (pictured) using a stylus, or  touchscreen controls such as pinch and swipe.
