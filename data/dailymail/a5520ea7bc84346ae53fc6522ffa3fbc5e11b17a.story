You can forget Whole Foods and farmers' markets, the place to stock up on organic produce is Aldi.

The budget supermarket is launching a range of organic products which it says could see customers save 25 per cent on their usual organic basket. 

The first produce to be introduced to the store will include cauliflower, carrots, broccoli and onions, with prices ranging from 79p to £1.49, compared to other supermarket prices which currently range from 85p to £2.45.

Aldi will be introducing its organic range over the coming months with all being in place by January 2015

The organic selection isn't the only new feature to the store with Aldi planning to sophisticate the supermarket further by extending their specially selected range. 

The latest selection will offer customers even more premium luxury products, which have all been 'Specially Selected' for their outstanding quality, ingredients, provenance and recipe.

The latest expansion follows the ongoing success of Aldi's premium range which has seen year on year sales increase by 74 per cent. 

As well as their organic range the supermarket will be extending their Specially Selected line

The new products include British Cold Pressed Rapeseed Oil at £1.99, Angus 30 Day Aged Sirloin Steak at £5.99, and  Imperator Carrots at £1.29.

As well as poshing up its produce Aldi is planning to extend its standard core line by adding additional products  providing customers with added choice in fresh meat, convenience food such as ready meals, mother and baby, household and beers, wines and spirits, and will see Aldi's core range increase by 11 per cent.

Joint Managing Director of Corporate Buying, Tony Baines, says that he has noticed a need for cheaper fresh produce as that on offer elsewhere is often out of the Aldi customers price range.

Aldi wants to make fresh produce available to all and not just those with a larger budget 

'Following customer feedback, we know our shoppers want to buy more organic products, but price is often the reason why it's not a regular purchase. 

'This is why we've launched a 100% British organic range at an affordable everyday low price.'

Tony added that he wanted to do away with exclusive nature that so often comes with fresh and natural products. 

'At Aldi we believe it's important for organic produce to be available to everyone. Our customers know we continuously work towards exciting them with our new offerings and that now, more than ever, they can buy their entire weekly shop at Aldi, safe in the knowledge they are purchasing the best quality products at everyday low prices. '

The new lines are being launched over the coming months, with all products to be in place by January 2015.
