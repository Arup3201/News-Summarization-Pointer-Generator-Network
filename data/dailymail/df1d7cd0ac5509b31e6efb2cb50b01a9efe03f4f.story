Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher has questioned whether Liverpool did enough to keep Steven Gerrard at Anfield. 

Steven Gerrard is on the verge of agreeing a £3.9million deal to join LA Galaxy on an 18-month contract, according to reports from the US.

The Liverpool captain announced he would be leaving the club after 26 years at Anfield and has confirmed he will move to the MLS at the end of the season - with David Beckham's former club the clear favourites to sign him.

Negotiations are understood to be taking place that would see the former England captain join the defending MLS champions in July. The MLS Board of Governors are believed to have approved the deal because the league will pick up a $750,000 supplement from the Galaxy.

The MLS operates under a salary cap structure, whereby each club has three Designated Player places that can be used to sign high priced stars.

The Galaxy already have US defender Omar Gonzalez and former Liverpool striker Robbie Keane (who shares the same agent as Gerrard) - but the third place has been freed up by Landon Donovan's retirement following victory in the 2014 MLS Cup.

An MLS representative said the league is 'not able to provide additional insight into a potential player agreement.' 

In an emotional interview, Gerrard admitted that the prospect of reduced playing time next term was a major factor in making what he described as 'the toughest decision of his life'. 

‘I think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team,’ said Gerrard during an exclusive interview with LFCTV on Saturday.

‘I’m bright enough to realise it is the right thing for everyone, but when you’ve been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time, it was a very difficult conversation to have.

‘I accept it and I’ll continue to give everything I’ve got, whether I’m starting, coming off the bench or whatever, but that was the key conversation that swung me to deciding to come away for a short while.

‘The reality is I am going to be 35 in the summer. I’ve been here for a long time, I’ve been coming to this training ground since I was eight. I always knew it was going to end one day and that it was going to be an emotional decision. That decision is here.’
