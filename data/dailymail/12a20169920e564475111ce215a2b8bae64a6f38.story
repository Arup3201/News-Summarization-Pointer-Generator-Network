Luis Moreno Jr., 26, was arrested for kidnapping after police pulled him over and discovered  two hostages in the back of his SUV

A New Jersey man was arrested for kidnapping after police pulled him over for apparently driving solo in a carpool lane and discovered two men were being held against their will in the back of his SUV.

Luis Moreno Jr., 26, was pulled over by Port Authority cops on Friday shortly after 8am when he appeared to be driving alone as he entered the carpool lane approaching the George Washington Bridge on I-95 in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

Moreno told an officer he had two passengers sitting in the back of his 2002 Toyota Sequoia, which had a Texas license plate, and rolled down the rear driver's side window so the policeman could see two men seated in the third row of the SUV, reported New York Daily News. 

The officer let Moreno go. But just as he began to pull away one of his passengers hung out of the open window and began yelling for help, a police spokesman said.

Moreno kept driving after the officer  ordered him to stop, but was soon  stuck in thick rush-hour traffic. 

More Port Authority officials arrived on the scene and ordered him to shut off his car.

Officers interviewed one of Moreno's passengers, a 33-year-old man, in Spanish. 

The man said Moreno had picked him up in Texas and agreed to drive him to Maryland for a fee. 

But on arrival Moreno had demanded more money than initially agreed. When the man was unable to pay Moreno locked the doors, took the man's cell phone away and began driving towards New York.

When police inspected the vehicle they discovered Moreno had disabled the locks for the rear window and doors, giving only the driver the ability to control them.

One passenger said Moreno had agreed to drive him from Texas to Maryland for a fee. But when they arrived Moreno demanded more money, and then took away the man's cell phone and locked him in the SUV when he couldn't pay

Language barriers prevented officials on the scene from communicating with Moreno's second passenger, a 24-year-old Asian man who did not speak English. 

Personnel from the U.S. Department of State were then called and the man revealed he had also been held against his will. 

Moreno, who is wanted on numerous parole violations in Texas, was arrested at the scene and his car was impounded by Port Authority police. 

Moreno has been charged with kidnapping and criminal restraint, as well as receiving stolen property and driving with a suspended license. 

He is being held in jail and his bail is set at $1million.
