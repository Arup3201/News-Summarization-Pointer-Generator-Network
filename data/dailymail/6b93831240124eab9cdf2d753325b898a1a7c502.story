The lawyer for drug mule Michaella McCollum Connolly has said she is prepared to identify her tormentors.

Speaking on the steps of the police station in Lima, Peru, where Michaella and Melissa Reid are being held, Peter Madden said Michaella had given him the 'details of her ordeal'.

The pair were arrested at Lima airport on August 6, with £1.5million worth of cocaine in their luggage.

Speaking yesterday, Michaella's lawyer Mr Madden said: 'She was in fact kidnapped, held at gunpoint and forced by threat to obtain and carry drugs back to Lima.

'She was not offered any money. She was threatened and held.

'She is now prepared and ready to give full details to the police in a questioning process.'

He said once the questioning process was over the results of the questions will go to a judge.

He said: 'There is a presiding judge who will then decide whether or not there is a prima facie case and that will probably be next week.'

Mr Madden said Michaella was 'denying any wrongdoing'. 

Melissa Reid, 19, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine as they waited for a flight out of the South American country

He said: 'She was kidnapped, she was put through an ordeal, as was the other young girl, Melissa.

'They were both taken advantage of by a gang of up to 14 men with guns.

'She was under severe pressure and fear during this process.

'The lawyer is in, I have spoken to him and I have discussed the case with him and he is now with Michaella and getting her ready for the questions.

'She is fine, she is upset but she is fine. She is prepared to go into the detail of what happened to her.

'It's a very difficult situation. People didn't give names but she is going to do her best to help police.

'Melissa is in the process of going through this questioning procedure and that is about wrapping up now.

'Then Michaella will be questioned in the same process.'

Asked if he was confident that Michaella could avoid jail with his help, he added: 'I think there is hope but it depends very much on the attitude of the prosecuting authorities here as to whether or not they are going to do this fairly.'

Asked if he had confidence in the Peruvian legal system and whether he agreed there was a perception you were guilty until proven innocent, he said: 'Yes, I would agree with that.

'Michaella is now in a position where she has to prove her innocence.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
