Barcelona's deadly front three are yet to play together due to Luis Suarez's ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini - but the prospect of the trio starting in the same line-up has just become even more mouth-watering.

Following this week's international matches, each of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Suarez have now reached - or passed - the 40-goal mark for their respective South American nations.

Between them, the trio have scored an astonishing 126 international goals in just 232 matches - and they have an average age of only 25!

Brazil forward Neymar produced the performance of the international week, scoring all four of his nation's goals - including a perfect hat-trick - in the 4-0 demolition of Japan in Singapore.

At just 22 years of age, Neymar has already netted a remarkable 40 goals in just 58 internationals since his debut four years ago and he sits an incredible fifth on the all-time Brazil scoring list, above the likes of Bebeto, Rivaldo and Jairzinho.

Messi, meanwhile, came off the bench during Argentina's 7-0 victory over Hong Kong and bagged a brace.

The humbling defeat of their Asian opponents went a little way to making up for the painful 2-0 loss to bitter rivals Brazil in the Superclasico de las Americas on Saturday.

BRAZIL

1) Pele - 77 goals (92 caps)

2) Ronaldo - 62 goals (98 caps)

3) Romario - 55 goals (70 caps) 

4) Zico - 48 goals (71 caps)

5) Neymar - 40 goals (58 caps)

6) Bebeto - 39 goals (75 caps)

ARGENTINA

 1) Gabriel Batistuta - 56 goals (78 caps)

2) Lionel Messi - 44 goals (95 caps)

3) Hernan Crespo - 35 goals (64 caps)

4) Diego Maradona - 34 goals (91 caps) 

URUGUAY

1) Luis Suarez - 79 goals (42 caps)

2) Diego Forlan - 36 goals (112 caps)

3) Hector Scarone - 31 goals (52 caps)

4) Angel Romano - 28 goals (69 caps) 

And his double against Hong Kong means Messi now has 44 goals from 95 internationals since his debut in 2005 - putting the 27-year-old second on Argentina's all-time top scorers' list behind only Gabriel Batistuta.

Finally, Suarez is yet to adorn the Barca jersey in a competitive match but that has not affected his brilliant international goal-scoring form during this round of matches.

The former Liverpool striker netted twice for Uruguay during a 3-0 victory over Oman on Monday.

His double takes Suarez to 42 international goals from 79 matches since his debut in 2007 - already making him his nation's top scorer in history.

The 27-year-old is now eight clear of Diego Forlan at the top of the list.
