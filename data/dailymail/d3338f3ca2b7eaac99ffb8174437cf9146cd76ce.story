For those desperately in need of a weekend by the sea, look no further than Scotland's southeast coast, only an hour drive from bustling Edinburgh.

While the charming town of North Berwick offers plenty of quaint B&Bs to choose from, the refurbished Sheriff Hall Granary, in East Lothian, provides the perfect base for larger groups or families to explore the area.

But, be warned: you will be required to disconnect fully, as WiFi is not always readily available, and 3G access is spotty to say the least.

Sheriff Hall Granary, located near North Berwick in East Lothian, Scotland, is a refurbished grain storehouse

As it turns out, the three-day break from our mobiles was a blessing - though no easy feat for seven twenty-somethings from London - as it forced us to get outside and actually speak to each other while spending time in the home's circular sitting room. 

Finding the house - without cell phone service, I might add - was the first hurdle to cross on our way to a relaxing weekend by the shore. 

Arriving in Edinburgh on the last Thursday evening flight out of Luton, by the time we had secured our car rental, we were well into the midnight hour.

Our first several attempts to find the house, without the help of GPS or street lights, was simply put, a comedy of errors.

Thankfully, the owners are used to dealing with such overwhelming confusion and after several hours - and several phone calls - we pulled up to the sprawling granary, which had been turned into a holiday home several years ago by the owner's father-in-law. 

Sheriff Hall is located just a 10 minute drive from the quaint seaside town of North Berwick

Despite the late night, we woke up early to set out in search of the closest town, North Berwick, with its quaint shops, artisanal bakeries, and most important for our weary-traveller purposes, a Tesco.

Our hunt for food was quickly abandoned, however, when we saw the stunning West Bay beach, which in the low tide, seemingly went on forever.

The small marina was every bit as picturesque, offering views of the Firth of Forth and plenty of brightly-coloured sailboats and canoes tied up and waiting to be taken out.

For those travelling with small children, it's also worth noting that the harbour is home to the Scottish Seabird Centre, where tours can be organised to learn more about the area's local marine life, most notably gannets and puffins.

On the sprawling Sheriff Hall property, there are many friendly horses (and chickens) roaming free

Back at the granary, the holiday home is situated on a working farm, which means, animal lovers may even be able to take part in the horses' morning feedings, so long as you ask nicely.

Chickens roam the property freely, alongside the horses and, at times, the owner's two friendly Labradors.

Near the main entrance of the granary is a cow barn, which, especially for the young urban males in our group, provided many hours of entertainment.

What can I say? They work in the City.  

The North Berwick Law towers 187 m (614 ft) above the town, but offers a relatively easy climb along its paths

At the summit of the Law is the famous 'whale's jawbone,' although its now a fibreglass replica

The Law offers beautiful panoramic views of the township, coastline and the Firth of Forth in the distance

Follow the gravel driveway from the house's front door and you'll stumble across the entrance to John Muir Way, a 215 km (134 mile) walking path that stretches across the country, from Helensburgh in the west through to Dunbar on the east coast.

From Sheriff Hall, you can walk towards the town of North Berwick and the Tantallon Castle, which turns out to be about a two-hour trek, or, alternatively toward East Linton and on to the end of the trail at Dunbar.

Although we initially set out for Dunbar, we unexpectedly wound up walking back toward North Berwick and its staggering 187 m (614 ft) hill, known as the Law. 

The summit features the remnants of an Iron Age fort and the town's infamous whale jawbone, which has stood there atop the peak since 1709.

Currently, a fibreglass replica of the original can be seen upon scaling the hill, after being anonymously donated in 2008.

Inside the home, which has been remodelled to the highest quality, there is a working fireplace and piano

The sleeping quarters are located in two separate wings - perfect for families vacationing together

And inside the house, the rustic furnishings are just as beautiful as the stately grounds.

The main living and dining area is circular, with several floor-to-ceiling windows illuminating the entire space.

A working fireplace and grand piano offer two additional luxurious touches.

There are two bedroom wings located on either side of the house and accessible via separate staircases.

A second sitting area can be used upstairs, next to the master bedroom and master bathroom

The main staircase leads to a second living space, complete with master bedroom, bathroom and children's play area - perfect if two families are travelling together.

On the other side, the upstairs boasts a double bedroom, one room with two twin beds and an additional bathroom.

Downstairs, off the kitchen, you'll find the house's fourth bedroom, complete with bunk beds, and during the warmer months, younger visitors will undoubtedly be equally as thrilled to find an enclosed pool off to the side of the back garden.

And with Easter, and the May bank holidays, just weeks away, there's no better time to visit.
