A Tory donor avoided tax by flying outside UK airspace on his private jet at night, a lobbyist has claimed.

The millionaire donor is said to have routinely flown out of Luton airport in the evening so he could sleep on his jet.

Because he was outside British jurisdiction at night, this allowed him to extend the number of days he could stay in the UK without paying tax.

As a non-resident, he could spend just 91 full days in the country each year.

The arrangement was revealed by Sarah Southern, the lobbyist at the centre of the recent cash-for-Cameron scandal.

The former aide to the Prime Minister made her comments during a dinner with undercover reporters in Zurich earlier this year.

The identity of the donor, who would often skip out of the country overnight to avoid tax, is not known.

Ms Southern said: 'I love that 90-day thing... because it's a full day.

'I know someone who will sometimes get on his jet and fly out and fly back in after midnight. So he's not been there for a whole day.'

She said the donor was so rich that it was worth his while making flights to nowhere to avoid an enormous tax bill.

The lobbyist said that with a fortune like his, 'you can sleep on your jet three times a week. You can do whatever you want. The world literally is your oyster.'

She said a helicopter took the donor to Luton airport where he stepped onto his jet and retired for the night in an onboard bedroom.

Since 2008, the tax authorities' 'midnight rule' has applied to anyone who is still in the UK on midnight of the 91st day.

Before 2010, days travelling in and out of the country were not counted under the 91-day rule.

The donor could therefore have saved two days off his entitlement with each overnight trip.

The guidelines were changed by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to include the days that a non-resident is in the country at midnight, even if they have just travelled into Britain that day.

Ms Southern told the reporters that she believed the donor's tax arrangements have since changed.

Chancellor George Osborne has described aggressive tax avoiders as 'morally repugnant' and has warned tax cheats that the government 'will find you and your money'.

The revelations come two weeks after Peter Cruddas, the former Tory party co-treasurer, was forced to resign after he was filmed selling meetings with the PM for Â£250,000.

He told the undercover reporters how he himself had made a fortune by avoiding taxes on financial transactions.

The spread-betting tycoon said his firm, CMC Markets, got around tax rules legally by classing transactions as 'bets' rather than conventional trades.

He said: 'That's my claim to glory. If you bet on something in the UK you avoid capital gains tax and stamp duty.'
