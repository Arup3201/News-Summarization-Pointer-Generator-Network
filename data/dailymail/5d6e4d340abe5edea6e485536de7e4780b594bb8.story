The Rt Revd Malcolm McMahon says scores of children living in poverty are going into school hungry every day and falling behind in lessons because of it

Children living in poverty are going to school hungry every day and falling behind in lessons because of it, one of Britain's leading Catholic Bishops has said.

According to the Rt Rev Malcolm McMahon, the Bishop of Nottingham, the problem is being 'masked by a veneer of respectability' in redeveloped city centres because impoverished families are too ashamed of the stigma of not having enough to eat.

The Bishop, who was last week appointed the Archbishop of Liverpool, is also chairman of the Catholic Education Service which oversees one in 10 schools in England and Wales attended by nearly 840,000 pupils.

He said teachers observed deprivation on a daily basis.

He told The Independent: 'There is a poverty which we witness every day in our schools.'

His views were echoed by the Children's Commissioner for England, Maggie Atkinson, who in a separate interview, warned young people were being hit hardest by the Government's austerity programme.

'The poorest families, and therefore their children, are paying the price now,' she said. 'We did in-depth analysis on the welfare bill. Families, parents with children, especially where there was already economic pressure on the households, would be ill-served by the welfare reforms, she told Total Politics magazine.

The Archbishop-elect said problems persisted despite vast levels of public investment, saying poorer children cannot keep up with their wealthier counterparts because of 'embarrassment and hunger'.

He said the problem was masked in cities like Liverpool which, because of regeneration, look prosperous but are in reality masking an underbelly of poverty.

In Liverpool, where a third of all children come from poor families, more than Â£1bn-worth of regeneration projects started last year.

The city's mayor, Joe Anderson said regeneration was key to helping cities become prosperous and invited the Bishop to visit and see the area's efforts to create investment and jobs first-hand.

The problem is particularly acute in cities like Liverpool, where vast regeneration programmes add a 'veneer of prosperity', according to the Bishop
