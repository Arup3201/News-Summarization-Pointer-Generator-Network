A baby orangutan needs certain skills to survive in the wild, right? But how will it learn the essentials without its mother to teach it?

This heartwarming video tells the story of an emaciated orangutan called Simanis who is rescued from a well-meaning farmer in Borneo who has kept him as a pet. 

The orphaned orangutan is one of many being rescued and taken to a sanctuary specially designed to teach apes what they need to survive.

Tied up all day and fed a diet of tofu and rice the orangutan has become malnourished. 

So International Animal Aid sends a team to rehouse the great ape at the Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilition Centre in Sungai Awan, Indonesia.

At the sanctuary little Simanis joins a group of other orangutan babies to learn survival skills over the next three years before being released into the wild.

Tied up: Simanis has been kept as a pet by a  farmer in Borneo but he is clearly emaciated

The ape is led away by his rescuer, but moments later jumps and clings to the man's leg like a toddler

The video shows the cute youngster clinging onto his rescuer before he is transported to the centre which will care for him over the next three years. 

One adorable shot shows him being popped into a wheelbarrow with a group of other baby orangutans as they are carted off to their new enclosure.

All together now: The newest recruit is joined with other orphans and taken to their new home

Staff at the centre, including vets, local volunteers and workers from all over the world care for the apes and teach them the skills they need such as feeding themselves, grooming themselves and each other and finding safe places to sleep and play. 

In Borneo, orangutan mothers are killed by poachers who catch and sell their infants as pets, condemning them to years behind bars or in chains. 

Some orangutans end up being smuggled abroad and imprisoned as exhibits in rundown zoos, private collections or even hotels.

International Animal Rescue is a charity which rescues the orphans and ensures they are rehabilitated into the wild.
