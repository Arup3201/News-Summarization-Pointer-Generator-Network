Billy Vunipola has admitted he got too big for his boots which was why England dropped him during the autumn internationals.

Vunipola, 22, began the November Tests as England’s first-choice No 8 but was axed following poor shows against Australia and New Zealand before concussion ruled him out of the last Test against the Wallabies.

The Saracen produced a man-of-the-match performance in the 28-15 victory over Sale on Saturday and afterwards admitted overconfidence had caused his dip in form.

‘There are little extras you do after training but I kind of just waived them,’ said Vunipola. ‘Rather than staying out for the extra five or 10 minutes, I thought I would be fine and maybe that told in games.

‘It is a massive learning curve for me to keep my feet on the ground and I can guarantee I won’t to do it again.’

All Blacks star Dan Carter is considering a move to Europe after the World Cup, with French club Racing Metro reportedly leading the chase for the iconic No 10.

The 102-cap New Zealander spent the 2008-09 season with Top 14 side Perpignan and is tipped to replace Jonathan Sexton, who is returning to Leinster.

Owen Williams wants to stay at Leicester and compete for a place in the Wales team from the Aviva Premiership.

The fly-half, 22, is at an advanced stage in contract negotiations even though a return across the border would boost his chances of being selected for Wales.

‘I’m happy to stay,’ said Williams. ‘If it means playing in front of 24,000 people every week and playing in big games then I want to play for Leicester. Hopefully, it doesn’t affect my Wales chances but we’ll see.’
