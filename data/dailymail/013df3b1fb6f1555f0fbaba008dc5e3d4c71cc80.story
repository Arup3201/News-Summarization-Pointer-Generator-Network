Bob Karlstrand, who is battling colon cancer and terminal lung disease, is giving away all his possessions before he dies

Veteran Bob Karlstrand has only months to live.

The 65-year-old is battling colon cancer and terminal lung disease and fears he won’t make it to his next birthday.

But the former staff sergeant, from Maple Grove, Minnesota, has one final mission before he dies: to give away everything he owns, including his home of 38 years.

His only stipulation is that his home goes to a fellow veteran.

Mr Karlstrand, who retired from an insurance firm, never married or had children and is an only child.

So he has already given most of his belongings, including his furniture, photographs and letters he wrote to his mother – and has given his $1million retirement fund to the nursing school at his alma mater, the University of Minnesota.

He says he had people come into his home and take whatever they wanted. 

‘In the end, it’s only material things,’ he told TV station KARE 11.

‘I’ve had a good life so I can’t complain at all,’ he said.

He has given the responsibility of finding new occupants for his home to Habitat for Humanity.

When Mr Karlstrand dies, they will refurbish the property, then find and help a veteran and his family move in.

'I wanted to give back to the veterans if I could,' he added. 

Mr Karlstrand enlisted at the age of 17 in 1967 and worked as an administrative specialist for the Field Maintenance Squadron at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia.

He was then deployed to Thailand in July 1969 and spent a year supporting B-52s in missions over Vietnam.

He took part in the Air Force’s back-to-school program and was released from service early to attend the University of Minnesota’s business school, graduating in 1973.

‘I have no family so everything I own would have to go somewhere,’ he told Military Times.

‘Like they say, "You can't take it with you." I was hoping that I could do all of this a little later, but it is not going to work that way.’
