A pilates instructor's heart stopped for 30 seconds after she suffered a near-fatal reaction to a filler injection.

Hailey Terrell suffered eight strokes and a cardiac arrest after the cosmetic injection in her chin.

The 37-year-old's heart stopped beating for 30 seconds, leaving her medically dead before doctors revived her.

The pilates instructor, who is from Oklahoma in Texas but was studying in London at the time, has had to relearn how to walk, talk and write.

Pilates instructor Hailey Terrell suffered eight strokes and a cardiac arrest when she suffered a near-fatal reaction to a filler injection to banish a wrinkle on her chin

The 37-year-old from Oklahoma in Texas, was living in London in May 2012, when she found a deal for a dermal filler injection online. She has since recovered from her ordeal after relearning how to walk, talk and write

But after five weeks in hospital and an intensive rehabilitation programme, Ms Terrell has made a full recovery.

She said: 'I had no idea a filler injection could kill me.

'When I went to have an injection there was a leaflet with all the side effects listed.

'But it was just like the paper in a paracetamol box - I never thought it would actually happen to me.'

After a total of eight strokes - one 
of the rare but possible side effects of filler injections - Hailey 
suffered a cardiac arrest and was put in a medically induced coma.

Her
 life was on the line as she fought against the potentially fatal 
reaction and doctors feared she may never breathe on her own again.

Ms Terrell was studying for a Masters in Real Estate at Cass Business School in London in May 2012 when she discovered a deal online for a dermal filler.

After thoroughly researching the practice, she set a date for her chin injection.

She said: 'I’d had injections before with no issues and nothing about this practitioner seemed out of the ordinary.

'She was qualified and a registered nurse so I thought that aspect was all I had to worry about.'

A day after her injection, Miss Terrell started to suffer symptoms. Struggling to swallow her food she went to hospital and was given medication for a food allergy. The next day she was back at A&E

Ms Terrell was admitted to hospital where she suffered a cardiac arrest and several strokes. Her heart stopped beating for 30 seconds and after reviving her, doctors placed her into a medically induced coma

Two years on and the pilates instructor is almost fully recovered, she has relearned how to walk and talk and has moved back to live in the U.S.

But the day after the procedure, Ms Terrell's first symptoms appeared.

She said: 'I took a bite of pitta and struggled to swallow it.

'I tried to tell my friend I couldn’t swallow my food properly but the words weren’t coming out.

'Suddenly I had an awful lisp and it was still there the next day.

'A friend told me I might have had a stroke.

'I thought only old people or overweight people had strokes but I agreed I should get checked out.'

The yoga instructor visited hospital but was sent home two days later with a prescription to treat a food allergy.

She said: 'The next day I knew I couldn’t eat but I made myself a really good dish anyway.

'On my first bite I just kept chewing and chewing and it got stuck. I started choking and thought I was going to die.

'I made myself sick before going straight back to A&E, but again no-one realised I was having a stroke.

'By this point I couldn’t even swallow my own spit and I was drooling profusely. They gave me a wand to stick in my mouth which sucked out all the saliva.

Ms Terrell said: ''I had no idea a filler injection could kill me. When I went to have an injection there is a leaflet with all the side effects listed. But I never thought it would actually happen to me'

The pilates instructor is now using her experience to urge others to think twice about having cosmetic injections

'I had to type messages into my phone to ‘speak’ to the doctors. I had been back in hospital for three days and I was really scared.

'I pleaded for a nurse to stay and hold my hand through the night because I didn’t want to die behind the curtain.

'That is the last thing I can remember.'

The next day - one week after her first hospital admission - Ms Terrell went into cardiac arrest and suffered a final round of strokes.

Her heart stopped beating for 30 seconds before doctors resuscitated her.

She was placed in a medically induced coma unable to breathe on her own and transferred to the intensive care unit at the National Hospital for Neurology, where she fought for her life.

Ms Terrell's parents flew straight over from America to be by her bedside. Seven days later, she pulled through to start her long road to recovery.

She added: 'When I woke up the left side of my body didn’t work at all.

'It took me a while to learn to walk again and I had to relearn to write too because I am left-handed.

'For months I would be out eating and my fork would just drop out my hand.'

But the 37-year-old has gone from strength to strength and completed her master’s degree despite an acquired learning disability.

Ms Terrell added: 'You would never know just by looking at me what happened. I have a small scar on my neck and have problems focusing but I am now in the best place I have been'

Exactly two years on, she is now living in Colorado, and has mostly recovered.

Ms Terrell said: 'You would never know just by looking at me what happened.

'I have a small scar on my neck and have problems focusing but I am now in the best place I have been.'

The yoga instructor is now using her experience to urge others to think twice about having cosmetic injections.

She said: 'I give people Face Lift Massage as an alternative to injections and you can really see the difference.

'I am developing a business to teach people self massage techniques for one’s face, among other natural remedies, such as nutrition, meditation and face yoga.

'Having a stroke and nearly dying for beauty is something I’m not willing to ever risk again.

'What happened to me just shows that the dangers are still there even if you go to a registered practitioner.

'I really hope my story inspires others to look for beauty in the only place it can truly be found, inside.'
