The former seaside retreat of one of the UK's most controversial fashion stars has gone on sale. 

Five years after Alexander McQueen's death his secret two-bedroom East Sussex hideaway has been put on the market with a guide price of £695,000. 

From the outside the modest stone built granary appears a world away from the bright lights of the catwalk and the influential designer's flamboyant public image.

But nestled down an unmade road, the centuries old property was a refuge for the star, whose private life was blighted by battles with depression, drink and drugs.

McQueen hanged himself at his main home in London's Mayfair after taking a mix of cocaine, tranquillisers and sleeping pills, in February 2010.

Through the key hole: The open plan interior was designed by the late fashion star who in private battled with depression, drink and drugs

The sale of the designer's sanctuary comes as a retrospective collection of McQueen's work has gone on display at London's Victoria and Albert Museum.The show features pieces taken from his ground-breaking 1992 MA collection shown alongside his last. 

The Old Granary, situated between Hastings and Rye, is being sold by Phillips & Stubbs estate agents for a guide price of £695,000.

Throughout the interior of the contemporary open plan detached home the stylish influences of the celebrated designer can be seen.

The stunning home, within walking distance of Fairlight beach, features an impressive open plan living room with limestone tiled flooring.

Both the kitchen and dining room are fitted with bespoke units and the bathroom fixtures were imported from Italy.

Upstairs the main bedroom has plenty of wardrobe space where the designer would have been able to store some of his collection.  

The East Sussex property was a sanctuary for the trouble star away from the bright lights of the glamourous fashion world

Both of the bedrooms have scenic sea views and on a clear night the glittering lights of France can be viewed.  

The garden also contains a one-bedroom detached guest annexe  where the designers host of celebrity friends, including the likes of Kate Moss, could stay.

The property is being sold with planning permission for an extension. 

The son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher, the glittering world McQueen came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in Lewisham, south London, where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters. 

 After leaving school at 16 with a single O-Level in art, the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at Savile Row tailors Gieves & Hawkes, before a stint at theatrical costumiers, Angels and Bermans. Both would have huge influence on his later career.

McQueen's big break came following a spell in Milan working for Romeo Gigli. On his return to London, he applied to Central St Martins for work as a pattern cutter.

Impressed by his portfolio, Bobby Hilson, the head of the master's course, persuaded him to enrol as a student instead. His faith in McQueen paid off. The designer's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by Isabella Blow. 

 From there, McQueen went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation, designing David Bowie's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous 'bumsters' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans.
