A previously unknown work by the Italian master Canaletto today sold for nearly £2million after spending a century with owners who didn’t know what it was.

Art experts were stunned when the family who owned it phoned them about the lost drawing of the market place in Venice.

The vendors had no idea of the value of the 10x14 inch work until they made enquiries about selling it with London auctioneers Sotheby’s.

Famed Venetian painter Canaletto created the work in the mid-18th century and it shows the market square, paved in 1758, ten years before his death.

A previously unknown work by the Italian master Canaletto of the market place in Venice has sold for nearly £2m today. The drawing shows the church of San Giacomo with the Ruga degli Orefici leading right up to the Rialto bridge

Canaletto often moved buildings around for his works but with this drawing he tinkered only slightly and the 18th century scene looks almost identical today (above)

The drawing was acquired in 1876 by the French landscape and genre painter Charles-Theodore Sauvageot.

It has remained in private hands ever since, being passed down his family until his unnamed descendants sold it at the auction house.

Enthusiasts and experts had no knowledge of it and it was never referred to in books despite it staying with the same French family.

The emergence of the work - the first drawing by Canaletto to come on the market in around 30 years - delighted both scholars and the art world.

Born 
Giovanni Antonio Canal and nicknamed Canaletto, which means 'little 
canal', he lived most of his life at Corte Perin, in a modest apartment 
in the San Marco district of Venice.

Following
his father Bernardo into painting theatrical scenery, his fame and 
money came later when he moved on to depict daily urban Venetian life.

Canaletto later became known fоr hіs grand scenes оf canals аnd the Doge's Palace.

He spent several years painting in England, which brought him even closer to his rich clients.

He died in 1768 in the apartment where he had lived for most of his life. He never married. 

It sold for a hammer price of £1.7million but with fees added on, the overall price paid was £1.94million.

Greg Rubinstein, head of old master drawings at Sotheby’s, said: 'This work is completely unknown. The owners are the descendants of the man who bought it in 1876. They phoned up and I was going to Paris and arranged to meet them.

'Although they had been told it was by Canaletto, they had no idea quite how wonderful it was or what it might be worth.

'I said that it was not just a Canaletto drawing; it was fantastic, amazing. I gave them the estimate and they were pleasantly surprised.

'Their ancestor’s collection was split up over the years between the family members.

'The current owners are not particularly wealthy, but importantly they looked after it.

'Many Canaletto drawings are hung in too much light and they lose the sparking light, which is the important thing. Only a minority of his drawings are in a great condition like this.'

Mr Rubinstein said the price paid for 
the Canaletto is a record for a drawing by the artist, easily dwarfing 
the previous sum of £493,103 paid in 1986.

Giovanni Antonio Canal - better known as
Canaletto - was a Venetian painter of landscapes and an important 
printmaker in etching.

He often moved buildings around for his works but with this drawing he tinkered only slightly and the 18th century scene looks almost identical today.

It was drawn in pen and brown ink over numerous ruled chalk lines with grey wash to make the tones.

It shows the church of San Giacomo with the Ruga degli Orefici leading right up to the Rialto bridge.

And it is made far more interesting by the numerous people going about their business in the market square.

He drew the scene many times through his career and it is one of the city’s most picturesque places and is the centre of Venice’s banking industry.

Mr Rubinstein said: 'Canaletto painted the scene several times during his life and this was drawn in the late 1750s or early 1760s.

'He has tinkered with it a bit and played a little bit fast and loose and you can’t stand in one place and see everything in this scene. But that’s his genius.'

There was huge interest when the drawing went under the hammer.

Mr Rubinstein said: 'Its appearance 
at auction today generated huge excitement, culminating in an intense 
bidding battle between six determined collectors.

'Together they drove the price to a 
sum more than five times the original estimate and four times the 
previous record for a drawing by the artist.

The record price paid at auction for a Canaletto is £18.6million for View Of The Grand Canal From Palazzo Balbi To The Rialto in 2005.
