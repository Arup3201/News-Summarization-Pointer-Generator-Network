Martin Johnson regrets his England players getting ‘caught out off the field’ during the disastrous 2011 World Cup campaign which featured a dwarf-throwing competition in Queenstown and stars making inappropriate comments to a chambermaid.

Incidents such as those, Mike Tindall kissing his ex-girlfriend in a bar and Manu Tuilagi diving into Auckland harbour ‘became the story’, says the former England coach, who broke his silence three years after the tournament in New Zealand.

Johnson said: 'We got caught out off the field. We were aware of what could happen and warned the players, but it still happened,' Johnson said.

September 11: Mike Tindall, Chris Ashton, Toby Flood and Dylan Hartley reportedly take part in a 'dwarf-throwing' contest in a bar in Queenstown.

September 13: Courtney Lawes is handed a two-game ban for 'recklessly striking' Argentina's Mario Ledesma with his knee. 

Johnson defends allowing his players to go bungee jumping on their day off.

September 29: Kicking coach Dave Alred and fitness specialist Paul Stridgeon are suspended after being found to have switched the ball Jonny Wilkinson was due to kick against Romania with without asking the permission of referee.

October 2: Johnson reprimands three players for making inappropriate comments to a female hotel worker.

October 9: Manu Tuilagi is formally warned by police and fined £3,000 by England rugby officials after jumping from a ferry in Auckland.

'The disappointing thing is that it's something we fell into even though we knew it was there.

'We warned the players about it and you think you've covered it off, when maybe you haven't covered it off. Maybe you have to say it every day.

'The difficult thing is that it gets perceived as something that it wasn't really.

'But if enough people say it is something, then everyone believes that is what it was. You're fighting a difficult battle.

'I'm not saying that things didn't happen, but I'm saying the perception is that that was the only thing that happened.

'That became the story rather than the rugby and that's what gets remembered.'

Tindall, Chris Ashton, Toby Flood and Dylan Hartley were caught  at a 'dwarf-throwing' competition on a night out during the tournament, players were allowed to go bungee jumping on their day off, inappropriate comments were made to a female hotel worker, while Manu Tuilagi was fined for jumping off a ferry.

On the field, they performed with limited ambition or adventure, grinding out narrow victories over Argentina and Scotland before exiting the competition against runners-up France.

To make things worse, lock Courtney Lawes was banned for two games for 'recklessly striking' Argentina's Mario Ledesma with his knee and kicking coach Dave Alred and fitness specialist Paul Stridgeon are suspended after being found to have switched the ball Jonny Wilkinson was due to kick against Romania with without asking the permission of referee.

Martin Johnson has broken his silence after England's disappointing Rugby World Cup in 2011

Johnson has defended his team but admitted: 'We all make mistakes'

Johnson, a Mastercard ambassador for the 2015 World Cup, insists the events in Queenstown have been distorted by misinformation and that his gravest error was his handling of the aftermath. 

Asked if he was hurt by the way it ended, Johnson said: 'The worst thing was the way the game got dragged through the mud.

'It wasn't actually a true reflection of those people and what we were about, but you're fighting a tidal wave almost at that point because everyone 'knows' what's happened because they've read about it.

'People start telling me what it was like when I was there.....that's the battle you have to win.

'That was my mistake, you have to win that battle as well. It's almost like a sales job.

'You see some organisations that are perceived a certain way publicly when actually they're not like that - good and bad because it goes both ways.'

Martin Johnson's record as England coach

Tests - 38 

Wins 21 Draws 1 Defeats 16

Six Nations title - 2011 

Johnson insists that the World Cup-winning heroes of 2003 got up to similar things during that tournament in Australia.

However, because of the results on the pitch they were not taken to task.

The former captain said: 'In 2003 once you've won the World Cup, everything is portrayed as being great and a perfect working machine. 

'But of course it wasn't - we were all human beings, we all made mistakes, had our frailties and did similar things that the boys did in 2011.

'It just didn't get to that level and didn't get recorded. And then you win, so everything is all right.'

Johnson defended a managerial record that spanned 38 Tests, numbering 21 wins, 16 defeats and one draw.

He takes pride in masterminding England's only RBS 6 Nations title since 2003 and highlights the number of players he blooded who remain active in the Test arena.

'People go, "It was a disaster at the World Cup", but England have won one Championship in the last 11 years and that was in 2011,' Johnson said.

'We won 10 out of 13 games that year and we did OK. Ultimately we brought through a lot of players who had a successful start to their career, although we were criticised for not doing that.

'Dan Cole, Alex Corbisiero, Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Ben Youngs, Chris Ashton, Ben Foden and Manu Tuilagi all came through.

'In 2008-09 there was a lack of guys who were really putting their hands up to play Test rugby. We did start bringing some through and they played well.

'Looking back at it, of course I would have done things differently. We can all do that.

'You do what you think is right at the time, that's all you can do. We could all say we'd go back and change things.'
