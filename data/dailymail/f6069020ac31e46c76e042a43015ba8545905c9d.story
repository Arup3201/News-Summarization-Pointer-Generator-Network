Hull captain Curtis Davies is hoping Manchester City's quest for multiple trophies trips them up when the sides meet on Saturday.

The Barclays Premier League champions visit the KC Stadium just three days before an important Champions League assignment against Roma and three after thrashing Sheffield Wednesday 7-0 in the Capital One Cup.

While many of the champions' top-flight rivals used the midweek cup fixtures to rotate their squad, Manuel Pellegrini used nine of the players who had drawn with Chelsea last Sunday.

And Davies, whose side go in as heavy underdogs despite home advantage, hopes Manchester City's divided focus counts against them on this occasion.

'Manchester City have got such strength in depth so to see some of the players they used in the cup surprised me, they must really want to win that competition,' said Davies, who is a club ambassador for the Teenage Cancer Trust.

'When I saw they had won 7-0 that was pretty shocking but I'm hoping that come the weekend they've burnt their legs out a little bit.

'They're also looking forward to a Champions League game next week that they will feel they have to win and hopefully they might just take their eyes off the ball a little bit and if so we might be able to take advantage.'

Despite the mitigating factor of the fixture list, Davies knows he will be coming up against opponents who are highly likely to be fighting for the title at the end of the season and will arrive in East Yorkshire with a confidence to match.

But it is a challenge he has no intention of shirking.

'We're Hull City, they're Man City...you have to be honest, the onus is on them to do well,' he said.

'The onus will be on them to win every game and anything we can do to upset the apple cart is good for us.

'Anyone who wants to play in the Premier League should want to play against these players. If not you may as well stay in the Championship or League One, wherever.

'You come to the top level to test yourself against the best and there's not many better than Manchester City, with the (Sergio) Agueros and (Edin) Dzekos of this world.

'It's going to be difficult, you can never get away from that, but you have to thrive on that fact.'

Hull could have hoped for easier opponents as they attempt to solve defensive problems that have seen them throw away winning positions four times this season, including each of the last three three matches.

It may be too much to ask for a shutout this time around, but Davies is still expecting a significant improvement.

'I can't put my finger on what it is but for me as a centre-half it's very frustrating,' he said.

'Last year we worked on solid bases, keeping clean sheets and nicked a few 1-0s, but this year we're getting the required goals but we can't keep the clean sheets.

'We need to work on it as a back four and as a team because it's not good enough really.'
