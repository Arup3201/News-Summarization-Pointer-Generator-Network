The family of a British tourist who drowned in strong currents off the Italian coast have questioned why a red flag was not raised to warn against swimming in that area.

Brian Kent, 45, was dragged under the water when he went for a mid-afternoon dip in the sea with his wife, Sally, yesterday afternoon.

His family today said no life-guard was on duty and there was nothing to suggest conditions were treacherous on that stretch of the beach.

His sister-in-law Nicola Phillips said relatives had been looking forward to the day trip to the seaside town of Sperlonga, which came on the family holiday to Rome.

She today paid tribute to the 'incredible husband and father' who would be 'sorely missed by everyone'.

'We had all looked forward to our trip to Rome and googled the spectacular beaches of Sperlonga,' Ms Phillips said.

'After arriving we ate lunch and Brian had a pizza and one glass of beer. He waited 30-40 minutes before going into the sea. There was no red flag, and later we found out no life guard on duty.'

She said this meant the family 'completely underestimated' the undercurrent which 'proved to be a fatal error'.

The strong swimmer was said to have been overcome by the waves minutes after jumping into the water. His wife was pulled from the sea by her two sons, Connor and Aaron but efforts to save Mr Kent failed.

Tourism hotspot: Sperlonga is about an hour and a half south of Rome and is a popular beach resort

Ms Phillips said: 'Sally's son Connor 
and his brother Aaron managed to pull Sally safely to shore and two 
unnamed persons eventually found Brian. But we believe it was already 
too late.

'Members of the family, passers-by 
and eventually the ambulance tried in vain to resuscitate him. Brian was
a strong swimmer, as were other members of the party, but a tragic 
accident occurred.

'My sister and their children would like to come to terms with this without the need to defend decisions that were made that day. Many thanks goes to everybody who helped, particularly the staff of the Aurora Hotel.'

A woman, who did not give her name, said she had been at work in a hotel when a number of panicked tourists rushed in.

'I was in the reception when people burst in to call for help,' she said. 'They said someone was in trouble in the water and we called an ambulance immediately.

'I went outside and could see the man in the water. One of his sons was trying to rescue him but I think it was already too late. It was very sad.'

Mirella Gagliardi, owner of the Hotel
Aurora, said: 'It all happened right in front of our hotel. The man who
died had arrived with his wife and group of other British people in the
morning to spend the day by the sea.

'They had a very late lunch and ate 
and drank quite a bit, then they decided to go for a swim. 

'The sea was rough - it wasn't the right sort 
of day to go into the water.

'He
hit problems right away and was dragged under by the currents and the 
waves, the sea was rough but I think the fact he had just had an 
abundant lunch probably didn't help either.

'His wife and some of the 
others were also in difficulty but they managed to get out of the water.

'It all happened in front of his poor wife. She was in a very bad way, very shocked.'

A coastguard helicopter was scrambled to the scene and paramedics were also dispatched but Mr Kent was declared dead at the scene and his body taken to the mortuary of a local hospital.

The group, all from London, spent the night in the Aurora hotel, while arrangements were made to repatriate Mr Kent's body after a local magistrate gave the go ahead for it to be released. They are expected back in Britain today.

Stefano De Stefano, owner of the Taverna
di Ulisse restaurant, where the party had lunch said: 'It was such a 
tragic end to what should have been a beautiful day by the sea. They had
come in here for lunch and had pizza and beers and they were all 
laughing and joking.

'There must have been around ten of them
all together, all men and women and there was a little girl as well. 
They were here for an hour, maybe more then they all went off to the 
beach. The weather was nice but the sea was rough, the waves were high 
and there was a strong wind as well.

'The first we knew something had happened was a few minutes later when we heard all the noise, looked outside and saw the ambulance and the helicopter on the beach. The man was on the sand and they were pumping his chest but sadly there was nothing that could be done.

'The area doesn't have a lifeguard and it's still early in the season and it happened midweek. If it was the summer there would have been a guard nearby. He must have been hit by a cramp after going in the water so soon after lunch.'

A police spokesman in nearby Gaeta said: 'We were called to the scene and arrived along with paramedics and the coastguard, to a man who had got into difficulties in the sea. He was pulled from the water and cardiac massage was carried out but there was nothing that could be done. 

'His body was taken to a local hospital and his family spent the night in the hotel. The magistrate ruled there was no need for an autopsy and the body will be repatriated back to Britain.'
