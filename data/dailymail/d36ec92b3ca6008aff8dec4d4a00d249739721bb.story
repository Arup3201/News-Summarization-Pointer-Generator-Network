The mother of a 12-year-old Chinese girl has said she is forced to tie up her young daughter after she suddenly started suffering 'uncontrollable rages'.

Ma Zimei said she and her husband had lived a normal life with their daughter Qi Yiting at their home in the village of Xiliuzhuang in east China's Shandong province until two years ago.

She said her daughter suddenly started suffering from fits of rage which would see her attack and bite people.

The 42-year-old mother said she now feels the only way to keep her daughter safe when she flies into a rage is to tie her down

Zimei said the fits mean the child is no longer able to go to school and whenever her mother cannot watch her she has to remain tied to the bed, despite the fact that it leaves her tearful and distressed

The 42-year-old mother said she now feels the only way to keep her daughter safe when she flies into a rage is to tie her down.

She said she could remember the moment her daughter first experienced one of the attacks.

She said: 'I remember it well, I was in the garden with her and she was taking a wash in the bath tub outside. Suddenly she leapt out of the water, tipped the bath tub over and then ran over to her grandmother and bit her.

'Together with neighbours we managed to hold her until she quietened down but after that there were several other incidents where she just had uncontrollable rages.

'I took her to several hospitals but they had no way of explaining these incidents and now the only way to keep her safe is to tie her down. If not she flies into a rage and attacks people, fighting and kicking them.'

The fits mean the child is no longer able to go to school and whenever her mother cannot watch her she has to remain tied to the bed, despite the fact that it leaves her tearful and distressed.

Zimei said: 'I can't get a job, I can't risk leaving her on her own or with my mother. I don't know what we're going to do when I get older and can't manage and she gets stronger. I can't see any alternative other than to tie her down'

Zimei said: 'I can't expect my elderly mother to control her and after she had the first attacks, my husband left us and divorced me.

'He hasn't paid any money for maintenance over the care of his daughter and we have to get by on the crops we can grow on my mother's land and on the money we get from the state.

'I can't get a job, I can't risk leaving her on her own or with my mother. I don't know what we're going to do when I get older and can't manage and she gets stronger. I can't see any alternative other than to tie her down.'
