It was after Jos Buttler’s incendiary 121 off 74 balls in the Lord’s one-day international against Sri Lanka in May that Alastair Cook announced his limited-overs wicketkeeper was ‘not ready’ for Test cricket.

Self-effacingly, Buttler agreed. But after more mishaps with the gloves yesterday from Matt Prior, attitudes might have changed.

The 32-year-old Prior is a warhorse of 78 Tests, well-liked by colleagues and with a proud record as a counter-attacking No 7.

Under pressure: Doubts have been cast on Matt Prior's position as England's No 1 wicketkeeper after a number of missed catches in the first Test with India at Trent Bridge

Beaten: A shot from India's Cheteshwar Pujara finds its way past the dive of Prior on day four of the first Test at Trent Bridge

The competition: There have been calls for Jos Buttler (left), England's short form wicketkeeper, to replace Prior in the team

After being dropped for the last two Tests of the Australian debacle, he was recalled against Sri Lanka at Lord’s and responded with a punchy 86. Named England’s Cricketer of the Year in May 2013, Prior had apparently refound his zest.

Since then, though, things have threatened to unravel. It’s hard to be over-critical of his batting: he alone held on during England’s first-innings collapse against Sri Lanka at Headingley, and on Friday here in Nottingham he fell victim to a dismal piece of umpiring from Kumar Dharmasena. But his glovework is another matter.

The alarm bells began to ring at Headingley, where Prior dropped Kumar Sangakkara on 27 shortly after lunch on a chaotic first day.

The catch was so straightforward that Liam Plunkett was halfway through a celebratory leap when Prior allowed the ball, which he didn’t realise had been pinned to his chest by his gloves, to plop to earth.

Disappointed: Prior could only make five runs in England's innings, which was rescued by an unlikely last wicket stand between Joe Root and James Anderson

Appealed: India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni successfully pleads the wicket of Prior off the bowling of Bhuvneshwar Kumar

Heroic: James Anderson set a world record on Saturday as he and Joe Root formed a final wicket partnership of 198 to rescue England on the fourth day of the first Test with India at Trent Bridge in Nottingham

If there was a touch of misfortune about that, then his wicketkeeping in this Test has done little to quell fears the Achilles trouble which limited him to one early-season Championship match for Sussex is not evidence of irreversible wear and tear.

Even ahead of this game, Buttler was called up as cover because Prior was experiencing tightness in his right thigh.

Prior allayed fears with a smart catch to his left to see off India opener Shikhar Dhawan on Wednesday morning, but has since missed three chances low to his right: MS Dhoni was dropped on 50 on the second morning, and on Saturday afternoon he twice failed to lay a glove on chances offered by Murali Vijay.

Whether Buttler would have snaffled them may no longer be the point. He is 23, full of drive and invention, and is averaging 40 for struggling Lancashire. He is just the sort of cricketer, in other words, who might fit neatly into the template of a brave new era.
