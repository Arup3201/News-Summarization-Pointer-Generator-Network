On first setting foot on the Shetland Islands many centuries ago, there was sadly nobody around with a camera to capture the moment.

But clearly this fact wasn’t exactly going to be lost on the latest generation of ‘Vikings’ last night when islanders staged their annual Up Helly Aa fire festival.

Having gone to all that painstaking trouble and effort of dressing up in horned helmets and fur-trimmed tunics, one warrior was clearly determined to ensure that it was recorded for posterity.

Up in flames: The event culminated, as ever, with the burning of a replica Viking galley - although weather conditions ensured it happened quicker than expected

On fire: The annual event attracts visitors from across the world to Lerwick on the Shetland Islands in Scotland and provides a welcome tourism boost

Parade: After torches where thrown onto the boat by a band of latter-day Viking warriors known as the Jarl Squad, gale-force winds fanned the flames and it burned

The spectacular event culminated, as ever, with the burning of a replica Viking galley - although weather conditions last night ensured it happened quicker than expected.

After burning torches where thrown onto the boat by a band of latter-day Viking warriors known as the Jarl Squad, gale-force winds fanned the flames and it burned in almost record time. The annual event attracts visitors from across the world to Lerwick and provides a welcome tourism boost.

Throughout the day, the modern-day Viking warriors made a series of public appearances, especially to schools where they encourage youngsters to learn about the early visitors to the Shetland shores.

Spectacular: The event is Europe's biggest fire festival and takes place on the last Tuesday of January each year

Team effort: A host of volunteers are responsible for the building of the galley and the production of more than 1,000 torches

Big job: Work begins in October to ensure that everything is ready for the celebrations, which often continue until 8am the following day, a public holiday on the island

The event is Europe's biggest fire festival and takes place on the last Tuesday of January each year. Around 900 costumed ‘guizers’ wearing winged helmets, sheepskins and carrying axes and shields, march through the streets of the town to recreate its ancient past.

The procession is led by the Guizer Jarl, or chief guizer. Earlier yesterday a Junior Jarl elected from a local secondary school headed a mini-torchlight procession. Later in the evening the main procession snaked through the town streets to burn a traditional galley.

Shetland and neighbouring Orkney were ruled by the Norse for about 500 years until they became part of Scotland in 1468. The festival stems from the 1870s when a group of young local men wanted to put new ideas into Shetland's Christmas celebrations.
