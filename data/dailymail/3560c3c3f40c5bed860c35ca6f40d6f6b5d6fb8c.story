Education Secretary Nick Morgan said there is good evidence that having classes full of children from different backgrounds thanks to immigration ‘can drive up standards

Britain's first new grammar school in fifty years is likely to be approved next month. 

Nicky Morgan is ‘open to being convinced’ of the case for the controversial expansion of an existing school in Kent.

Tory MPs are putting pressure on the Education Secretary to give the go-ahead for a grammar school annexe in Sevenoaks.

Previous proposals were rejected by Mrs Morgan’s predecessor, Michael Gove, because they failed to clear red tape put in place by the Labour government.

But Mrs Morgan is now said to believe the new application is ‘much stronger’ after Kent County Council insisted its updated plan was ‘compliant with the regulations’.

Meanwhile, the Education Secretary has insisted that a ‘rich ethnic mix’ can improve Britain’s schools. 

She said there was good evidence that classes full of children from different backgrounds thanks to immigration ‘can drive up standards’.

Her comments directly contradict warnings from Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, who said schools were struggling to cope with an ‘influx’ of migrant pupils. 

And Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith last month said new arrivals were changing the ‘character’ of schools.

In parts of London, children with English as a second language now make up as much as three-quarters of the school roll.

Speaking to the Observer newspaper, Mrs Morgan said: ‘I’m not one of those people who thinks that immigration is always a bad thing. 

'The evidence from London suggests that a rich ethnic mix can help to drive up standards.

‘It’s clear that many migrant families really support their children and appreciate the transforming power of education.’

She also said she disagreed with Mr Gove’s use of the term ‘the blob’ – describing an obstructive Left-wing education establishment resistant to reform – saying that it ‘didn’t help’.

Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged £67million to boost school standards in maths, science and computer skills.

About 15,000 teachers will be sent for retraining under the plans, while school-leavers embarking on maths or physics degrees will be offered cash in return for going into teaching once they graduate.

Pupils will also be taught to program computers, or ‘code’, as part of a new GCSE.

Last month a study by Bristol University found that schools with large numbers of migrants and pupils from ethnic minorities gain the best GCSE results because they have a stronger work ethic.

Mrs Morgan’s controversial comments come two weeks after one of her education ministers also claimed the influx of foreign students was changing the culture of schools for the better.

Mrs Morgan again went to war with her predecessor Michael Gove, rejecting his portrayal of the education establishment as a left-wing ‘blob’

Nick Gibb, also a Conservative, said the fact that pupils who spoke English as a second language tended to be academically more able, because they had learned to speak two languages. 

But critics warn there is a serious shortage of places at primaries - at which one in five pupils now speak English as a second language.

In some parts of London, children with English as a second language now make up as much as three-quarters of the school roll. The figure is around half in places including Slough, Luton and Leicester.

Even David Cameron has said that immigration from Europe was putting ‘pressure’ on public services such as schools and hospitals.

In her interview, Mrs Morgan said: ‘There’s no doubt immigration can put pressure on public services, especially in places like Slough, but I’m not one of those people who think that immigration is always a bad thing.

‘The evidence from London suggests that a rich ethnic mix can help to drive up standards. It’s clear that many migrant families really support their children and appreciate the transforming power of education.’

Mrs Morgan said she wants a greater focus on ‘character education’ in schools.

‘What I mean is a focus on things like the additional character skills we all need to get on in life – resilience, grit, self-esteem, self-confidence.’

The Education Secretary also clashed with her predecessor Mr Gove, who would often use the word ‘blob’ as shorthand for an obstructive teaching establishment that was resistant to reform.

Asked about the term, Morgan says it was unhelpful and created a false impression of ministers’ real attitude to teachers.

‘It captures the imagination and then it’s used for ever after,’ she said. ‘I don’t actually know who did it and I don’t know in what context… But it doesn’t help in terms of people then using that quote.’

One senior Tory at the heart of policymaking said: ‘Nicky is having a very difficult time of it,’ and that Gove ‘can’t let go’.

A close ally of Mrs Morgan, who is also the minister for women, insisted that she was determined to make her own mark and that, ‘if they thought she would just be a Stepford minister’ without her own ideas and views, they had seriously misjudged her.

She added: ‘Sometimes some of the language or the tone that was used, like “we’re going to take people on” and “we’re going to change things and challenge” was counter-productive; as I say, what gets lost are the people at the centre of the system. And most particularly the students. That’s who we’re doing it all for.

‘I would like the teachers to say she listened and parents to say she was on our side in getting the best education for our children.

‘My task is about listening to what teachers are saying, and saying to them, “What can we do? Take some burdens away, give you more freedoms?”.’
