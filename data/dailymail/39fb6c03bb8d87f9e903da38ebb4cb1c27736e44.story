When 16-year-old John Dwan picked up a metal object on his grandfather’s property he had no idea that it could have been the end of his very young life.

But the boy soon realised after he showed his grandfather Barry Dwan who immediately recognised the object as a World War II mortar shell.

The naturally curious teenager dug up the object which was sticking out of the ground and threw it in his ute at the Warwick property near Morgan Park on Tuesday.

‘He knew automatically what it was and put it behind a tree and called the police,’ John told MailOnline. 'I had no idea what it was – I just picked it up and put it in my ute because it looked unusual.’

The young welder said he felt lucky when his astounded grandfather explained the dangers of the bomb.

‘He said it could have blown up me and my ute – he couldn’t believe it,’ he said.

In no time at all Mr Dwan’s property near Morgan Park in Queensland resembled a surreal crime scene with at least ten police officers securing the area

The police guarded the mortar shell until two Australian Army officers attended to dispose of the bomb.

John and his grandfather watched on as the army officers placed the bomb deep underground and then detonated it. 

‘It was really loud and left a big hole about one metre deep and two or three foot wide,’ John said. ‘The army officers showed me photos of bombs and grenades in case I see anymore.’

Both army officers described the blast as impressive and said John was extremely lucky to be alive and to be able to tell his story.

His mother Shelly Dwan was very distressed at the thought of what could have happened to her son.

‘I’m absolutely devastated that my son came across something like that – it’s very upsetting,’ she said. ‘John is a very smart boy but he has obviously has never seen anything like this – I don’t think I’ve seen anything like this at my age either.’

During World War II an Australian Army’s detention Barracks was located on the south side of Warwick, east of the New England Highway and north of Flitcroft Street.

The Detention Barracks at Warwick were reputedly the scene of violent riots during the war.
