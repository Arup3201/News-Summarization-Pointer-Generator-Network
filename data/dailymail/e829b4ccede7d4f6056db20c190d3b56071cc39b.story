A cabinet minister has lost a High Court bid to hush up revelations that her rugby-playing son took banned steroids.

Caroline Spelman’s son Jonny, who has played for England under-16s, last night issued an apology saying he was ‘very sorry’ for taking the drugs.

The millionaire Environment Secretary, who obtained a gagging order to keep the public in the dark about ‘private matters’, abandoned her controversial injunction yesterday after a judge ruled in favour of a right to know.

Revealed: Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman took out the injunction for her 17-year-old son who had taken banned steroids after suffering a leg injury when playing rugby

Mrs Spelman decided not to appeal the
ruling and instead issued a statement explaining why privately-educated
Jonny, 17, had taken the steroids.

She pursued the injunction despite 
senior Tories warning her it was folly.

They said her legal battle would
only succeed in giving the story wider publicity.

Jonny, who has played
for his country in under-16 matches against Italy and Wales, is 
understood to have ordered a consignment of banned drugs over the 
internet to aid his recovery from a sporting injury.

He took the steroids for four weeks before being caught by his school at the end of last year.

When the Spelman family learned the 
Daily Star Sunday newspaper was planning to publish the story, the 
minister applied to the High Court to have it suppressed.

High Court: The injunction remained in place until 4pm today to give Jonathan, who was suing through his mother and father Mark, an opportunity to ask the Court of Appeal for permission to challenge the judge's decision

The Spelmans were granted an interim 
injunction last month but yesterday they were counting the cost of 
£60,994 in legal bills after Mr Justice Tugendhat refused to continue 
the order.

He said it was ‘not necessary or proportionate’.

The tabloid newspaper had argued its 
story was strongly in the public interest. But Mrs Spelman’s lawyer said
its ‘real purpose’ had been to launch a ‘political attack on Mrs 
Spelman, using her teenage son’s private information as a weapon’.

A source close to the Spelman family 
said Jonny had been ‘devastated’ after suffering a serious injury during
a school rugby match in September, tearing the cruciate ligament in his
left leg.

The injury ruled him out of trials 
for England’s under-18 squad, while doctors advised he would have to 
wear a leg brace and could be out of the game for at least nine months.

The source said: ‘He thought he may 
have lost the chance of pursuing his dream of a professional rugby 
career. He then did something very stupid and took some banned 
substances to try and speed up his recovery.

‘He’s a teenage boy and he is not the first to do something stupid, but he is extremely sorry about it.’

The source insisted the Spelmans had 
taken out the injunction to protect their son from greater pressure, 
claiming: ‘This was not about trying to gag the press, it was about 
trying to protect their son.’

In a joint statement, Mrs Spelman and
her husband Mark, a senior executive at the management consultancy firm
Accenture, said:

‘Our son knows that taking a banned substance can 
never, ever be right and he is deeply sorry for the mistakes he has made
and is determined to learn from them.

‘We will do everything we can to 
support him as he faces the consequences of his actions. He is still 
very young and we hope he can be given space to do that.’

Gareth Morgan, the editor of the 
Daily Star Sunday, said it was ‘a great victory for press freedom’, 
adding: ‘The use of banned substances by an elite athlete is a matter 
that is in the public interest and an injunction to hush up the facts 
should never have been sought.

‘We remain bitterly disappointed the 
Spelman family went down this route and attempted to silence the press 
using their wealth and influence, an option unavailable to ordinary 
members of the public.’

Mr Justice Tugendhat warned his 
decision not to continue the injunction was not a ‘licence’ for the 
press to publish whatever they chose.
