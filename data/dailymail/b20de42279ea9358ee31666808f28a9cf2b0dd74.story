West Ham have signed six players from an Under 8 east London team that beat Barcelona on their own back yard.

Upminster Park Rovers Under 8s defeated their Spanish counterparts in the Barcelona Football Festival final after winning all three of their group games and a semi-final along the way.

And now, after the British team triumphed 2-1 in the final, West Ham have pounced and signed up six of the Barca beaters.

West Ham's head of academy recruitment Dave Hunt exclusively told Sportsmail: 'We have signed six players from the squad but they have been training with us since the age of five or six at our pre-academy sessions.'

Rovers Manager Steve McMahon told SWNS.com: 'The final was a really tough match, but then again we were a Sunday League team playing against a squad from one of the biggest clubs in the world.

'Our boys managed to score two goals quite quickly, and then held on until the end of the match.

'I'm so proud of my team. They performed throughout with exemplary discipline, much better than players twice their age.
