Found: The body of Abdullah Alkadi, a 23-year-old electrical engineering student from Saudi Arabia was discovered along Interstate 10 on Thursday

Two men have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a college student from Saudi Arabia, whose body was fond on California highway last week - one month after he went missing.

Abdullah Abdullatif Alkadi, 23, was found dead on Thursday along Interstate 10 in Palm Deserts, more than two hours away from his Los Angeles home where he was last seen.

The Los Angeles Daily News reports that Alkadi had sold his Audi S-5 through Craigslist with an asking price of more than $35,000 the day before he was last seen.

Alkadi had moved to the United States in 2010 to pursue a degree in electrical engineering student at Cal State University, Northridge according to his brother, Ahmed, 32, who is also a student there.

'He wanted to make his family, his parents and himself proud,' said Ahmed. 'He wanted to be a contributing member in our society but things turned out the other way around.'

'I want to bring anyone who is responsible or involved to justice,' Ahmed said. 'I have full faith in the justice system here.' 

The month-long search for Alkadi brought in the FBI at the request of the LAPD, according to spokesperson Laura Eimiller.  

'It's not uncommon for the bureau to provide resources on
request in missing persons cases,' Eimiller said. 

She declined
to further discuss details of the FBI's involvement because Los
Angeles police detectives were leading the investigation.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Alkadi's cell phone had been tracked to Beaumont, 80 miles east of Los
Angeles, but that someone had deactivated it.

Police located the car Alkadi sold and said the buyer was not connected to the man's disappearance.

Peace: Alkadi's brother Ahmed said that Abdullah was a peaceful guy and asked for empathy in spite of any religious or language barriers

Robbery?: Alkadi disappeared the day after he sold an Audi on Craigslist with a listed price of over $35,000, though the buyer was cleared of any connection

No further details have been released about the two men who were arrested, though Police Chief Charlie Beck is scheduled to speak about the case on Monday, according to the LAPD.

Ahmed will accompany his brother's remains back to Khobar in Saudi Arabia, where Alkadi's parents live.

'He was a peaceful guy,' said Ahmed. 'Regardless of any barriers we have with language or religion, he’s a human being. I would like the public to pray for his soul to have peace in eternity.'
