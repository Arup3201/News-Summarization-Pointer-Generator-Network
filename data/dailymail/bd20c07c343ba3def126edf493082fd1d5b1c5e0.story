The lead agency behind the search for the missing MH370 flight has warned it will be forced to undertake fewer investigations after cutting 12 percent of its staff due to $2 million budget cuts.

The Australian Transport Safety Bureau's annual report  detailed losing more than 200 years of combined corporate and investigative experience in the same year as the disappearance of MH370 and the shooting down of MH17.

Ten transport investigators are among those to go from the transport safety regulator after cutting its staff from 116 to 104 since July 2013.

ATSB's Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan said investigating the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 was the 'greatest challenge' the bureau had faced to date. 

'We have more than 12 per cent fewer staff and we have been required to task some of our investigation and administration staff to the major and ongoing investigations into the two Malaysia Airlines disasters,' Mr Dolan said.

'For the foreseeable future, we will be able to undertake fewer investigations and we will need to carefully consider and constrain the scope of investigations initiated.'

The Malaysia Airlines plane disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March with 239 people on board, including six Australians.

While the safety body was given additional funding from the Federal Government for the extensive search, Mr Dolan said there would continue to be pressure on ATSB resources.

'(MH370) is the most serious aviation occurrence ever to involve the ATSB and its precursors, and is arguably the most mystifying, expansive and difficult search operation ever undertaken in the history of commercial aircraft,' Mr Dolan said.

'At the same time as we were required to undertake difficult decisions in relation to our staffing and resources, we received the news of the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and of its possible location in the Southern Indian Ocean, in Australia’s Search and Rescue Zone.

'The decision to reduce our staff numbers was particularly difficult as it was made in the knowledge that there is no contingent workforce of highly skilled transport safety investigators available in the marketplace to be deployed at short notice in the event of a new crisis.

'It was indeed sobering to see more than 200 years of combined corporate and investigation experience leaving the ATSB.'

The ATSB also deployed two investigators to the Ukraine in July after Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down by a missile with a number of Australians on-board.
