This weekend sees the return of one of Britain’s finest – WBA super-bantamweight world champion Scott Quigg.

I’m a fight fan and one of the bouts I would love to watch is Quigg against Carl Frampton. Like other fight fans, I also want to drive the politics out of this sport and make it happen because after this weekend’s test, when Quigg faces a tough defence against Tshifhiwa Munyai, I want to make a huge fight for him.

We are already in discussions with the likes of Leo Santa Cruz, the WBC world champion, and Kiko Martinez, the IBF champion, because Quigg will move on to a great fight, whether it involves Frampton or not.

I am doing what I can behind the scenes. After increasing my substantial offer to Frampton at the end of last year, we are still no closer.

That is because of the politics of boxing and they have a habit of cropping up. Don’t get me wrong, I’m blessed to be in a job like this but it does have a tendency to kick you in the nuts.

The rollercoaster of matchmaking meant that Quigg’s original opponent for this next fight, Venezuela’s Nehomar Cermeno, pulled out. He had visa issues which required a trip to his embassy and a submission of fingerprints, which he failed to do.

We looked at various options within the WBA rankings and Munyai looked a good, credible fight. He was already in the country because he has been sparring with Martin Ward. He has looked devastating on his other fights here, including stopping Martin Power twice for the Commonwealth bantamweight title and he also stopped Lee Haskins.

He has also won an IBO world title and is on a four-fight winning streak. He is dangerous and awkward, a complete style change to Cermeno. That is a massive test for Scott, challenging his intelligence and his training to see if he can adapt accordingly. It is a potential banana skin. This is a sterner test than Cermeno.

In terms of what will happen if Quigg comes through this, I am considering the options. I understand that Frampton’s agreement with another broadcaster restricts him from fighting on Sky. That’s the politics we talk about in this sport.

I will do what I can to make it happen. Frampton has talked about options we would request - not true. As a voluntary challenger, I would be willing to have just a rematch clause and, if Frampton beat Quigg, we would do the rematch in Belfast. So, what is the problem? It’s a chance for both fighters to make huge money and a fight that the British public want to see.

Alternatives: Spain's Kiko Martinez - along with Leo Santa Cruz - are other possible Quigg opponents

I don’t think for one minute that Frampton is afraid – both these guys are warriors. I just want to get it done. This is a chance for both to make a huge amount of money in a division where there are not many big-money fights.

Frampton has his eyes on Santa Cruz, who has just had his mandatory defence. I don’t believe Santa Cruz will fight him next, or even this year. As it happens, we are talking with Santa Cruz ourselves about a fight and I think it’s more likely he will have a unification bout with Quigg than a fight with Frampton.

Where does that leave Frampton? I think there will come a point where Team Frampton need to look at what is out there and, if they want it, there is a shot at Quigg’s title waiting for them.

I am sick of these great fights not happening so I am on a mission to make this one go ahead.

A fair bit has happened since my last column – we signed James DeGale.

Just a few years ago his profile was huge, but I think he has fallen off the radar since he lost that tight decision against George Groves.

He is what I call a buzz fighter – he is someone who needs his mojo to be firing and needs a crowd to perform. I think fighting in front of small crowds just wasn’t giving him that buzz. Let’s see how he likes 80,000 at Wembley.

James has a real tough test in Brandon Gonzales and, if he comes through that, he will fight the winner of Froch and Groves. Motivation won’t be a problem for him.

We’ve had some good news. I can confirm we have an extra 20,000 tickets for Froch-Groves and I will announce next week how you can buy them. It will be one of the most spectacular events in boxing history.  

Great expectations: An extra 20,000 tickets will be released to see Carl Froch and George Groves at Wembley

Rematch: Groves lands a left on Froch's chin in his controversial loss in Manchester in November last year

Anthony Crolla fights John Murray in Manchester on Saturday on the undercard of Quigg-Munyai. What a fight. It is a city divided – Crolla from the red side and Murray from the blue side.

Crolla is on a great run and is almost ready for a world title fight and Murray is on his way back.

What has Murray got left? He looks in better shape than ever. And I believe Crolla is hugely under-rated on the world stage – he may look like a male model and be one of the nicest guys in the sport, but I think you will see a spiteful edge from Anthony in this one.

These two used to work each other’s corner but I am starting to notice a bit of needle. This could be a special fight and I can’t call it either way. I like the idea of Ricky Burns eventually fighting the winner.

Roll on Saturday.

Speaking of Burns, I am looking at getting him back out on June 27 in Glasgow. I am looking at the WBC route and ultimately a shot at their champion, Omar Figueroa. We will pick an opponent who will put us in position for him.

Javier Prieto is a fight I am looking at – we have made them an offer and Scottish fans can expect a great card – with another big domestic clash made yesterday. Watch this space.

Next challenge: Ricky Burns could face the winner of Crolla and Murray, but Omar Figueroa is the ultimate aim

Four hours and 10 minutes for the marathon. I’m in bits.
