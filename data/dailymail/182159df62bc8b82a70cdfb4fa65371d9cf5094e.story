Sydney's head Islamic funeral director has said that no Muslim funeral home will accept the body of Siege gunman Man Haron Monis, suggesting instead that authorities dump his body at sea.

The body of Monis remains in the morgue, and has yet to be claimed. It is set to be be released before Christmas.

The body will be given a simple funeral by the Department of Health if his partner does not claim it, reports Daily Telegraph.

When asked about the fate of the 50-year old extremists body, Amin Sayed, the funeral director within the Lebanese Muslim Association, said 'we don't care about him, we don't know him, chuck him in the bloody sh**house.'

'Nobody's going to do his funeral. No Muslim funeral home will accept him,' he said.

'They can throw him in the bloody sea.'

Mr Sayed said Monis would receive a secret funeral with an unmarked grave, and that they would not accept any amount of money to arrange his funeral.

'Anyone who does harm to Australians, we don't want him,' he said. 

Following a coroner request, a forensic pathologist will carry an autopsy on his body.

A NSW Health spokesperson told Daily Telegraph 'Local health districts are responsible for the processing and payment of destitute burials and cremations in their district.'

'Where the death of a person has occurred outside of a public health facility, and the police have determined that the state.

'Where the death of a person has occurred outside of a public health facility, and the police have determined that the state is ultimately responsible for their burial, the local health district will fund a funeral.'

Monis's wife Amirah Droudis is responsible for the funeral arrangements, 

No Muslim can be denied a holy funeral unless they renounce their faith before their death.
