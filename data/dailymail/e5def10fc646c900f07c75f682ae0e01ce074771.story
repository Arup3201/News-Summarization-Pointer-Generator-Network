Sentenced: James Earl Dean 25, handcuffed himself to 18-year-old colleague to get a date

A man has been handed a ten year sentence for handcuffing himself to a colleague in a desperate attempt to get a date.

Jason Earl Dean, 25, attached himself to his 18-year-old co-worker at a Taco Bell as she left their workplace, after trying to get her attention for a month.

Mr Dean waited outside the fast-food restaurant until the woman finished her shift at 9pm and handcuffed himself to her as she tried to get into her car.

He fled after fellow staff at the fast-food restaurant in Ringgold, Georgia, heard her screaming and came to her rescue.

According
to the 18-year-old, Mr Dean had been ‘making passes’ at her for a month 
before the August 2011 incident, trying to convince her to go out with 
him, Catoosa News reported.

Mr Dean was on the run for two days before police arrested him in nearby Dalton.

Mr Dean entered a blind guilty plea 
for the charge of false imprisonment and was sentenced to four years in jail
and six year on probation by a judge at Catoosa County Superior Court.

He has also been ordered not to have any contact with the victim or her family.

‘It's
a split sentence,' Lookout Mountain assistant district attorney Alan 
Norton said.

'Four years is to be served in the department of 
corrections, while the remainder is to be served on probation with 
specific conditions.'

Despite being 
sentenced on Monday, Mr Dean, has been using his Twitter account to post
YouTube videos he likes, and yesterday he posted appreciation for Avril 
Lavignes ‘Happy Ending’.

A few days earlier he shared Bridgit Mendler’s Ready or Not, which includes the poignant lyrics, ‘ready or not, here I come … I will find you’.

Before his incarceration in Catoosa County jail upon entering his plea in September, Mr Dean frequently tweeted young stars such as former face of the Disney Channel Selena Gomez, Nickelodeon star Victoria Justice and singer Jordan Pruitt begging them to meet him.
