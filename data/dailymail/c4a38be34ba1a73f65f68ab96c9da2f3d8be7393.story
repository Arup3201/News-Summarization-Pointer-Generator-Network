Amassed over a lifetime, in pristine condition, and still in their original boxes, this lovingly collected haul of toy cars is set to go under the hammer for £100,000.

The mass of Dinky toy cars, trucks and trailers, which when packed up fill 80 crates, started as nothing more than a passion for a young boy who liked buses and vans. 

The toys form what has been dubbed the North West Durham Collection, which contains 999 lots.

The collection is a mass Dinky toy cars, trucks and trailers all individually boxed, which when packed up fill 80 crates

The single most sought after lot is expected to a mint condition Dinky 903 Foden Flat Truck with tailboard in mid blue with light brown. It has an estimate value of £900-1200

The owner, who does not wish to be identified, started the collection some 60 years ago in the North East after he became interested in the public service and commercial cars and vans he saw on the streets as a child.

Now he has decided to part with the collection, which will be sold by Vectis Auctions, of Thornaby on Tees, on July 11.

Vectis cataloguer Nick Letherbarrow said collections like this don't come along very often.

'This is a proper collector who has collected these all over a period of time,' he said.
