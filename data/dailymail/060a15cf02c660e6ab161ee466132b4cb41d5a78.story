After beating Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday to reach the FA Cup semi-finals, and with seven wins in their last eight Premier League games, Arsenal are looking good on the pitch.

And three of their attacking stars have shown that they also strive to look good off it, by  posing in new Arsenal-inspired suits.

Mesut Ozil revealed that he has a personal grooming kit that he brings to every game, while Olivier Giroud claimed that he is inspired by David Beckham and Andriy Shevchenko.

'I bring my own grooming kit to the game... moisturiser, gel and shampoo,' said Ozil. 'I like to take care of myself… Football players like to take care of themselves and pay attention to the way they dress.

'I think as a human being you need variety; you can't just do football, you need a combination. Football is of course my main focus, which is a lot of fun and I love to be on the pitch. 

'But I have other interests beside that, like fashion or being with my family.' 

Ozil and Giroud posed with Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez for GQ Style in their new Lanvin suits, and Giroud admitted he likes it when fans immitate his hair.

'Yes, they try to do the quiff,' he said. 'Especially in France, I see a lot of them. It is funny because they try to imitate me – but it is always a pleasure.' 

'David Beckham is a top man.' he added, when discussing his fashion influences. 'I love the guy and what he can show in terms of style as well. He's really classy, an icon… 

Beckham, who was at London's V&A museum on Thursday night for a fashion launch, has long combined success on the pitch with life as a fashion icon off it, but Giroud also picked out another, less expected ex-footballer as his major style influence.

'When I was young, I looked up to Andriy Shevchenko. He was so elegant, and on the pitch as well.'
