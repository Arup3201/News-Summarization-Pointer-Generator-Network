A plan to build a modern-day crematorium next to the gas chambers and ovens of a Nazi death camp has sparked a storm of protest from Jewish organisations around the world.

Authorities in Lublin in eastern Poland want to construct the crematorium near to the Majdanek camp where 80,000 people were put to death during the Second World War

The camp was captured nearly intact because the advance of the Soviet Red Army was so rapid it prevented the Nazis from destroying it before liberation.

Death camp: Tens of thousands of people - including many Jews - were killed by the Nazis at Majdanek

Horror: The bodies of those who died were incinerated in the camp's crematorium

Tragic history: The memorial at the entry gate within the concentration camp

Tragedy: Barbed wire fences trapped the prisoners into the camp, while armed guards kept watch for escape attempts

Majdanek remains the best preserved Nazi concentration camp of the Holocaust with intact gas chambers, crematoria and barracks.

It is a place of pilgrimage for hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. But now Lublin, which has no crematorium for modern day funerals, has deeply upset Europe's Jews with its insensitive plan to build one near Majdanek.

'If people see smoke rising from a crematorium chimmney they will think it comes from Majdanek,' said Roman Litman of the Jewish community of Lublin, the city from where the Nazis directed the murder of 2.4 million Jews in a string of death camps in Nazi-occupied Poland.

'It cannot and must not be built anywhere near this hallowed ground that is strewn with the ashes of the dead.'

Lublin city council is due to decide the planning application from a company called Styks before Friday.

Krzysztof
 Zuk, mayor of the city of Lublin, and authorities overseeing the 
Majdanek memorial site which includes a museum, want the company to find
 a different location for its crematorium which - if allowed to go ahead
 - would be barely 750 yards away from the place where the Nazis 
incinerated their victims.

Lublin
 says it needs a crematorium as more and more Catholics shun burials. 
But the rising tide of anger at the spot which has been earmarked may 
mean further delays in getting one built.

'There should be no crematorium in 
this area because of the one that is already there,' said Edward 
Balawajder, the former director of the Memorial Majdanek.

'Majdanek
 is known around the world as a memorial to the victims of Nazism.

It 
should not be shrouded in the smoke of burning people again,' read a 
letter to the local paper signed by Jewish groups while Anti-Defamation 
League leader Abraham Foxman, himself a Holocaust survivor, said; 'The 
idea is disgusting, that a company wants to build such a thing near holy
 ground dedicated to the memory of people who suffered incredible 
cruelties.'

Some locals, however, have backed the project, saying they want to live in a 'normal' city unburdened by the Nazi past.

Majdanek
 began life as a concentration camp for Jews and Soviet POWS, but began 
exterminating inmates soon after opening in 1941.

Majdanek
 functioned as sorting and storage depot for property and valuables 
taken from the victims at the killing centers in Belzec, Sobibor, and 
Treblinka, all in Poland.

Victims at Majdanek were forced into gas chambers that were pumped full with the exhaust from captured Soviet tank engines.

The crematoria next door still has ash remains of victims in its ovens.

The Nazis built hundreds of concentration camps across occupied Europe before and during WWII.

The two largest groups prisoners, both numbering in the millions, were Polish Jews and Soviet prisoners of war.

There were also large numbers of Roma, ethnic Poles, political prisoners, homosexuals, people with disabilities, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholic clergy, Eastern European intellectuals and others.

Western Allied aviators were also sent to concentration camps as spies.
