The new girl: Businesswoman Hilary Devey is replacing James Caan on the Dragon's Den judging panel

She's the hard-working, tough-talking businesswoman who overcame difficult obstacles on her way up the ladder.

But despite her confidence and fiercely-ambitious nature, Hilary Devey said she felt nervous taking her seat as the new judge on Dragon's Den.

Devey, 54, has replaced James Caan for the ninth series of the reality TV show, and said she was delighted when the BBC asked her to join the panel.

In her first interview since joining the team, Hilary, who is the boss of a 
Leicestershire-based freight distribution firm, spoke to the Sun and said: 'I have always 
been a fan of the show and I was so pleased when the BBC asked me to be 
on it.'

And how does she think she was received by the wannabe entrepreneurs?

'Viewers
will have to decide for themselves,' she said, 'but I hope they think I
have brought flair and flamboyance to the Den. Humour too.

'I have brought a competitive edge to proceedings. I enjoy the rivalry. It's fun.'

'I lost my rag a few times as I 
thought people were trying to pull one over me. I don't like that. I am 
tenacious and I have not been afraid to work hard.

She told the newspaper that she was made to feel at ease
by her fellow judges - Duncan Bannatyne, Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden 
and Theo Paphitis - but added: 'I was still very nerve-racking on the 
first day. I felt like the new girl at school and it did take a few 
pitches to find my feet.'

Bolton-born Hilary runs Pall-EX which pulls in £100million in revenue every year.

But she revealed that she worked hard to
get where she is now, even sacrificing her personal life for the job, 
but she said her determination to succeed was spurred on by some 
horrible times in her life.

Hilary, who has divorced twice, had a tummy tuck that gave her a stroke and helping her son battle his heroin addiction.

Two years ago she went for the cosmetic procedure and said: 'I wanted a flat stomach, like a lot of women, but I did not rest much afterwards and I had a stroke. I am OK now.'

She then had to tackle her son Melvin's £600-a-day heroin habit - which he funded by stealing from his mother.

She said: 'For a long time I had to lock every door behind me.

'He would steal my clothes, food, electrical household items - anything he could sell for money to get a fix.'

But Hilary said he has overcome his addiction and said: 'Time is a healer and he is going back to college.

'We are really close and I will always be there for him.'

Looking forward, she said: 'I really loved doing Dragons' Den.

'I really hope the BBC will want me back.'
