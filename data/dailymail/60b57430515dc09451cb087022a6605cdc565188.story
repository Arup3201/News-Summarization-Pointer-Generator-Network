If this cliff was on Earth it'd be among the tallest in the world - but it's on a comet just two and a half miles wide.

The towering, jagged edifice, half a mile high with 65ft boulders at its foot, was revealed by an amateur astronomer who studied an image beamed back by the Rosetta probe as it orbits comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko.

From his home in Kendal in the Lake District, Stuart Atkinson's creation has been picked by Nasa as its astronomy picture of the day - leading him to declare with delight: 'Christmas came early for me today!'.

Breathtaking: This cliff half a mile high has been spotted on comet 67P by the Rosetta probe - despite the lump of ice and dust measuring just two and a half miles across. Amateur astronomer Stuart Atkinson wrote: 'Just imagine standing there, craning your neck back'

The original image was one of many released from the £1.1billion Rosetta probe, which has been orbiting comet 67P since it caught up with it in August following a ten-year, four billion mile chase.

Mr Atkinson relied on notes by the European Space Agency which said the picture - pieced together from four taken 12 miles from the comet on December 10 - measured 1.8 by 1.6 miles from end to end.

He tilted and cropped the image so just the cliff remained, pointing vertically down to what appeared to be the duck-shaped comet's centre.

'As soon as I saw that image I could see one area was just crying out to be cropped and turned into a landscape view,' he wrote on his blog Cumbrian Sky. 'Isn't that something?

'I think that is a genuinely stunning view. Just imagine standing there, at the foot of those cliffs, with those huge boulders scattered all around you, craning your head back to look up at the wall looming in front of and above you.' 

Original: The image was taken from the right hand side of this image, a composite of four taken by the Rosetta probe on December 10 some 12 miles from the rubber-duck-shaped comet's surface and measuring 1.8 by 1.6 miles from end to end

Beauty: The comet is hurtling towards the sun at 83,900mph and will reach its nearest point in August of next year, scientists say

According to Nasa the boulders at the foot of the ice and rock face, which are on surprisingly smooth, sandy-looking terrain, could measure 65ft across on their own. 

But anyone who jumped off the enormous cliff would be likely to survive because of the comet's low surface gravity, which is several hundred thousand times weaker than that on Earth.

Rosetta is still orbiting the comet despite scientists losing contact with its £172million robotic surface lander, Philae, which landed at an angle with its solar panels partially obscured last month.

That mean the European Space Agency had just 60 hours to gather data about the comet's make-up before its batteries ran out.

Rosetta itself will remain in orbit around the comet as it hurtles towards the sun at around 83,900mph, reaching its closest point in August 2015 before it sweeps around and back out of the solar system.

Unseen world: Some parts of the comet appear remarkably smooth, but it is pockmarked with jagged cliffs and impact craters

A mountain to climb: The high-resolution images are a far cry from those sent back by Nasa's Voyager probes in the late 1980s

The project has already been hailed as one of the greatest scientific achievements of 2014 by the journal Science.

Data from Rosetta recently showed that water on the comet had a strikingly different composition to that on Earth - suggesting the water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet as previously thought.

The half-mile cliff on 67P, about a fifth of the size of the entire comet, is the same size as the highest sea cliffs on Earth - which tower half a mile high over the North Pacific Ocean in Molokai, Hawaii.

However, it is far from the most dramatic rock features found in the solar system.

The highest cliffs ever seen were spotted by Nasa's Voyager 2 probe in 1982 as it photographed Miranda, one of the moons of Uranus.

Despite the moon measuring just 300 miles across, it had a gigantic ice cliff with a sheer vertical relief of 12 miles - making it more than ten times higher than the walls of the Grand Canyon.

Despite the impressive features of the comet (pictured), Uranus' moon Miranda has the tallest cliffs in the solar system at 12 miles
