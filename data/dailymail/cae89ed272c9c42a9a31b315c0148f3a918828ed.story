A rapist has been jailed after his schoolgirl victim confronted him more than 30 years later and asked 'do you remember me?'

Father-of-two Christopher Martin pounced on his victim, then aged 15, after he offered to walk her home from a social club in Manchester in 1980.

After the attack the landscape gardener, now aged 51, was able to return to his 'care-free' life, as the girl kept quiet about the ordeal.

Christopher Martin, 51, has been jailed for seven years after being convicted of the historic rape of a teenage girl in 1980

But a chance encounter more than 30 years later, led his victim to finally find the courage to report Martin to the police.  

The court heard the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons,  approached Martin after seeing him and his family enjoying themselves at a festival and said: 'Are you Christopher Martin. Do you remember me?'  

He was jailed for seven years after a jury convicted him of rape following a trial at Manchester Crown Court.

Martin had claimed that his was the victim of mistaken identity, but the jury disbelieved his version of events.

The jury heard his victim had trusted him to walk her home from the social club more than 30 years ago.

'She was excited at the prospect of being walked home by you', said Judge David Stockdale QC, sentencing.

'She thought you were something of a catch, and that your offer meant an indication that you were interested in her. As it turned out you were interested in her, but in all the wrong ways.'

The victim, now a grown woman, repeatedly slapped Martin around the face as he launched his attack.

After Martin had raped the girl he left her 'covered in blood',  in the dark, isolated corner of the park.

At the time the girl only confided in her best friend about what had happened in the park. 

It was not until June 2013 that she saw Martin again, enjoying himself with his family at the Didsbury Festival in Manchester, and confronted him. 

She saw him and again days later in the pub and made the decision to go to the police.

Police said the victim finally had the courage to come forward after seeing him again and reading in the press about a number of historic rape cases. 

Martin's barrister said he had lived 'a very ordinary, unremarkable, blameless life', working consistently and caring for his elderly parents and disabled older brother.

She said: 'He has two very small children. Those two children are of an age where they will notice their father is no longer present. The two children inevitably will feel the consequences of the custodial sentence which is imposed upon Mr Martin.'  

Martin of  Fallowfield, Manchester, was also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for life.

After the case, Detective Constable Laura Hughes said: 'The victim was so scared after she had been raped that she felt she could not report it to the police.

'However recently she saw Martin a number of times and her memories of the attack came back to her and this along with the media reports regarding historic rapes gave her the confidence to come forward and report the incident to the police.

'I would like to praise her for having the courage to come forward and speak to us over three decades after the attack happened.

'I hope that this sentence provides some encouragement to other people who may have been victims of this sort of abuse to report it to the police.'
