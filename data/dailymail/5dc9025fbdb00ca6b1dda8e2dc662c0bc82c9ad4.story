Five people arrested in connection with the Paris terror attacks were last night released from custody.

The gunmen who carried out the attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, a policewoman outside Paris, a kosher market and a printing house all died after standoffs with police.

Relatives of the attackers have been given preliminary charges - but five people were freed from custody yesterday, and no-one now remains in detention over the attacks that left 17 people dead.

The details were confirmed this morning by Paris prosecutor's spokesman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre.

Hayat Boumddiene, the widow of one gunman - named as an accomplice - is said by intelligence officials to have travelled to a Turkish city near the Syrian border before all traces of her were lost.

Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo offices, led police on a chase for two days and were cornered on Friday at a printing house near Charles de Gaulle Airport.

Separately, Amedy Coulibaly shot a policewoman to death and attacked the Paris kosher market, threatening more violence unless police let the Kouachis go. Four hostages died, as did Coulibaly.

Among those arrested but since released was 18-year-old Mourad Hamyd, who became known as 'the third suspect’ - even though he was in class at the time of the shooting.

The brother-in-law of Cherif handed himself into police on Wednesday, horrified and baffled to hear his name circulating in the news and on social media.

But the high school student was released without charge on Friday evening, and told AFP: ‘I was stunned, completely overwhelmed by the events but the police officers were very correct with me.’

Numerous witnesses verified he was in school when the Kouachi brothers gunned down 12 people at Charlie Hebdo.

And Mr Hamyd said: ‘I'm in shock, people said horrible and false things about me on social media even though I am a normal student who lives quietly with his parents.’

He added: ‘The attack was horrific and my thoughts are with the victims.’ It remains unclear how Mr Hamyd - who until last week was unknown to the police - became linked to the magazine attack.

He said: ‘I only hope this won't taint my future. I have nothing to do with this whole thing, Cherif is just my brother-in-law with whom we have a fairly distant relationship.’

Mr Hamyd's sister, who is married to Cherif, was taken into custody on Wednesday and freed on Saturday. ‘I am sure she is also innocent,’ an unnamed relative told AFP.

Her lawyer, Christian Saint-Palais, said she has condemned the killings, and expressed her sympathy for the victims.

Mr Saint-Palais also said the wife had been unaware of her husband's plot, and had 'the same reaction to the rest of the national community' to the shootings, which had left her 'stunned'.

As France prepared for a huge march in Paris in honour of the victims today, Mr Hamyd's family said they would attend a rally in their town of Charleville-Mezieres to pay their own tribute.

But Mr Hamyd, hoping to fade back into anonymity as soon as possible, will not be joining them.

Meanwhile, MailOnline can reveal that Mr Hamyd, who was linked with driving the getaway car that carried the Kourachis from the Charlie Hebdo offices, was due to have his driving test on Friday.

The teenager had a driving lesson at 5pm on Wednesday evening with instructor Jean-Claude Garraud, just hours after the brutal massacre that shocked the world.

Mr Garraud said: ‘He was hesitant and distracted during the lesson. For example, he stopped the car on the road where he should not have.

‘At 6am on Thursday morning, I heard on the radio he had been arrested. I was completely shocked. He is a calm and good boy. He is not a delinquent. He is serious.’

Today, a major rally of defiance and sorrow - protected by an unparalleled level of security - will honour the 17 victims of three days of bloodshed in Paris that left France on alert for more violence.

Unity against extremism is the rallying cry for the hundreds of thousands expected to attend the gathering, including the Israeli prime minister and the Palestinian president.

More than 2,000 police are being deployed on Sunday to protect the crowds, in addition to the tens of thousands already guarding synagogues, mosques, schools and other sites around France.
