Devastated: John Halliday, pictured, had to have part of his leg amputated after doctors failed to notice the spread of a serious infection

A grandfather whose leg had to be amputated after a series of hospital blunders had been awarded £1.5m in compensation.

Health and Safety consultant John Halliday, 59, is now confined to a wheelchair in the wake of failures by doctors and has been warned his life expectancy is likely to be shorter.

Medics at Bradford Royal Infirmary failed to diagnose a serious infection which later spread to other parts of his body including his spine, leaving him with ‘devastating’ injuries.

He has been forced to give up work and is now heavily reliant on help from carers in adapted accommodation.

He has been warned a combination of earlier and more recent illnesses is likely to cut his life short.

In
an out-of-court settlement, he has been awarded compensation after the 
hospital admitted liability for negligence in delays in diagnosing and 
treating septic arthritis which would have avoided the amputation.

Mr Halliday, from Retford, Notts, said he felt he had been ‘abandoned’ by the NHS.

There
had been a ‘catalogue of errors’ in his care but it was only a year 
after he first fell ill that he realised mistakes had been made.

He said: 'It’s unbelievable, it really
is. I’m in a wheelchair. I have carers in every day and they have to do
most things for me. I’m not able to work - and can make a cup of tea 
and a sandwich and that’s about the limit nowadays.

'At first I was very angry but I’ve had to accept what’s happened and make the best of the hand I’ve been dealt.

'It is a large sum of money but it doesn’t bring back the life I had.'

The father-of-two, a former 
psychiatric nurse before setting up his own business, had suffered from 
gout attacks for years which left him bedridden but had never needed 
hospital treatment until 2008 when he began suffering serious problems 
linked to his left ankle.

He
was examined by doctors at Bradford Royal Infirmary who wrongly told 
him he was suffering from cellulitis and an allergic reaction to 
medication.

He was given 
antibiotics but did not undergo an early surgical washout of the ankle 
to eradicate the infection which can damage vital cartilage.

It
was not for another 10 days that he was given the correct diagnosis of 
septic arthritis which had led to toxic shock syndrome and kidney 
failure.

Despite the joint 
being washed out four times and again two months later, the efforts 
proved too late and he was told he needed a below-the-knee amputation.

But before the operation could take 
place, he was readmitted to the hospital in January 2009 where tests 
showed the infection had spread to his lungs and spine.

His leg was amputated two weeks later but his other problems continued, leaving him with severe curvature of his spine.

Owing
to the back problems, he was unable to walk using a prosthetic leg and 
cannot even move short distance on crutches.

He suffers from severe back
pain and phantom pain in his missing leg.

He
has now had to move from his home in Clayton, Bradford, where 
he was a regular spectator of the city’s rugby league and football teams
and a keen fishermen, to live closer to his family in Retford, 
Nottinghamshire.

Surgeons who examined the case agreed if 
he had kept his leg, his ability to get around would have been improved 
and he would have been able to become mobile earlier, which would have 
reduced his spinal problems.

'Abandoned': Mr Halliday is now confined to a wheelchair and has had his life expectancy cut short after the treatement he received at Bradford Royal Infirmary

Mealla Logue, of MPH Solicitors of Manchester, who represented Mr Halliday, said the negligence had led to ‘devastating’ injuries.

A Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We are deeply sorry for the distress Mr Halliday has experienced as a result of the care he received at our hospital.

'The care we provided fell below our usual high standards and we sincerely apologise to Mr Halliday for this.'
