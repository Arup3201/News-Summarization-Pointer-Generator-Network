Thanks to the generosity of readers, the Daily Mail's Christmas Appeal for Sue Ryder hospices has now raised an incredible £108,100.

Over our four-week appeal, we highlighted the wonderful care and support that the charity provides to the terminally ill and their families.

From offering pain relief, to bereavement counselling for children, even just being someone to talk to, Sue Ryder's staff and volunteers make a real difference. But more than 60 per cent of the charity's funding comes from voluntary donations, without which it could not continue.

Money from Mail readers is enough to fund more than 3,125 home visits (posed by models)

The good news is that the total donated by Mail readers is enough to fund more than 3,125 home visits from a Sue Ryder nurse to provide pain relief, or 5,405 bereavement counselling sessions for grieving children, or 13,859 hours of end-of-life care.

As chief executive Heidi Travis says: ‘Most people would like to die at home or in a hospice, pain-free and surrounded by family and friends. 

'Sue Ryder's vision is to make incredible care available to all, no matter where they live or what their circumstances are. The Daily Mail Christmas Appeal is a significant step towards making this a reality.'
