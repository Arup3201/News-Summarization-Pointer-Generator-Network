These are the adorable images of a baby who has formed a special bond with a sloth.

Baby Alia, first met Daisy the sloth when was she was just two days old and the pair have been inseparable ever since.

Daisy is almost like a real-life teddy bear for five-month-old Alia and the pair love to play and take naps together. 

Unlikely BFFs: a baby sloth called Daisy and adorable five-month-old Alia

Baby Alia first met Daisy when she was just two days old and the two have been inseparable since

Alia's parents Julia Heckathorn, 29 and Jason, 35, from Virginia, brought Alia home from the hospital the same day they welcomed four-month-old Daisy into their home.

The couple already own a kangaroo called Boomeroo, an anteater called Noche, sugar gliders and a cat called Larry.

Julia writes and illustrates a series of children's books called Search for the Hidden Clover, which chronicle the adventures of animals in a bid to educate children about the importance of caring for the environment.

Boomeroo, Noche, Daisy, and Dexter the sugar glider are all characters in her books.

Daisy is actually a character in Julia's books - and the couple also own several other animals

As fate would have it: The couple welcomed baby Alia and Daisy the sloth into their home on the same day

Julia also visits schools across America where she reads books from the Hidden Clover series, gives talks about conservation and enables students to meet their favourite characters from the books.

The couple had been looking for a sloth to expand their educational team when Julia fell pregnant with her first child, Alia.

And Julia said it felt like fate that they had welcomed their first baby and first sloth into their home on the same day.

Julia said: 'We had been looking for a US born, well raised and healthy baby sloth suitable for children's education for four years.

Baby Alia is also friends with Boomeroo, the couple's kangaroo 

'It just so happened that the first one available to us was born just after I became pregnant with Alia, and ready for a new home just as Alia was born.

'Alia was two weeks late in arriving, and there was only one day we were able to have Daisy travel to us due to the weather warming up for the summer.

'So I believe that the events happened as God planned them. I guess he knew we could handle the work of two babies at the same time, and that it would be great for them to grow up together.

Cute as can be: When the pair nap together, Daisy allows Alia to nuzzle into her soft fur

Jason and Julia are huge proponents of educating children about animal and environmental conservation

'When Alia and Daisy sit next to each other, Daisy sniffs Alia while Alia nuzzles into Daisy's soft fur. They are so sweet together.

'They even wear the same coloured flower head pieces in their hair. Boomeroo, our kangaroo still comes into my office and hangs out with us too.

'Boomeroo walks up to Alia, puts her hands on her and sniffs her as Alia chuckles.'

Mum Julia said: 'There are challenges to being an author with many animals, as well as two new babies'

'The sloth and baby have been growing up together and working alongside mummy as I write my books'

Together Julia and Jason also conduct school and community events in Panama and Peru during conservation and missions trips to spread the love of nature and reading.

Daisy is now accompanying them and Alia on their school visits and it is during their time together on these trips that Alia and Daisy have grown closer.

Julia said: 'There are challenges to being an author with many animals, as well as two new babies that just want to be held and snuggled. 

'But the challenges are also joys that allow me to teach my own child to love and care for the natural world.

'The sloth and baby have been growing up together, taking walks together, and working alongside mummy as I write my books and travel to schools.

'It may sound like an unusual situation, but the look on the school children's faces as they meet their favorite book characters in real life are priceless. 

'These are memories that will stick with those children for a lifetime.'
