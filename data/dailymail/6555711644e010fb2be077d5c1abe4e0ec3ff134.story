Atletico Madrid have confirmed they have reached an agreement with San Lorenzo for the transfer of Angel Correa.

The teenager has signed a five-year contract, subject to a medical, and the fee is believed to be around £6million.

Correa has scored 10 goals in 48 games for San Lorenzo, and has been compared to former Atletico star Sergio Aguero.

Potential: The teenager has been compared to former Atletico hitman, not at Manchester City, Sergio Aguero

The 19-year-old plays in an attacking midfield role, but has featured in a number of positions.

Atletico won La Liga last season, as well as reaching the Champions League final, and may be strenthening their squad early to prepare for some big losses, including the possible departure of Diego Costa.

On top of the transfer news, Diego Simeone's side have revealed their new kit for the 2014/15 seaso.

The traditional red and white strip is part of Nike's 'Risk Everything' campaign, and is based on the 1975 kit, when Atletico became champions of the world for the first time.

It has three wide stripes on the front and back, as well as the distinctive white box to display the players’ numbers on the back.

Legendary: The new strip has three stripes on it in tribute to the 1975 'champions of the world'

Nike took 3D body scans of many of the world’s leading footballers to create a kit with an updated and perfect new fit. The new fit allows the body to move more naturally within the kit, and so effortlessly improves players’ comfort and performance.

The new home kit will be available at 
Atlético de Madrid Official Stores, specialist stores and at nike.com in
 Spain from June 6 and the rest of the world from June 26.
