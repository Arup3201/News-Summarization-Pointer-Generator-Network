Stuart Lancaster insists England will give everything in pursuit of filling the nation with pride at the 2015 World Cup.

The quest for the sport's ultimate prize commences a year on Thursday when the hosts face Fiji at Twickenham in what they hope will be the first of seven games that will culminate in Chris Robshaw lifting the Webb Ellis trophy.

All conquering New Zealand, the reigning world champions, start as clear favourites, but Lancaster insists England will empty the tanks in the hope of seizing their crown.

Lancaster: England will be ready for Rugby World Cup

'We'll do our best to make sure we deliver and deliver in a way that will make the country proud,' Lancaster told England Rugby TV.

'The sense of the country being behind the team is a very powerful motivator.

'The support people have for sporting events in this country now is better than anyone's in the world.

'The team's performances will have a huge impact on the country.

'The World Cup will have a huge impact and the knock on effect it will have on morale in the country will inspire more and more people to play the game.

England have not won the World Cup since 2003 when they triumphed against then-hosts Australia 

'For seven weeks of our lives we will put everything aside and completely focus on one goal and that goal is winning the World Cup.

'There will be ups and downs along the way, but when we get to September 18, 2015 I'm confident no stone will have been left unturned.

'We'll make sure that we are ready and ready to deliver.'

England have 12 matches until Fiji to place themselves in the best possible position to repeat the achievement of Martin Johnson's heroes of 2003.

Head coach Lancaster says he has instilled a strong sense of national pride in his players

One of the tools introduced by Lancaster has been instilling a strong sense of national pride in his players.

'We have worked hard on talking about the identity of what being English means,' he said.

'You have to have character to be an England player, a strong sense of purpose.

'You can never take a backwards step and must always deliver under pressure.

'A level of commitment is needed that is probably above and beyond what most people would expect.'

'Alongside all that you need those world-class players who can deliver those moments that make them world class.'
