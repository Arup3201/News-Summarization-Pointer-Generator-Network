David Beckham, cricketer David Gower and Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell are among those set to receive tax demands totalling millions of pounds after investing in potential tax avoidance projects.

HM Revenue & Customs is understood to have been sending out letters to investors in film finance schemes set up by Ingenious Media. 

This is despite the fact the schemes are still being disputed, with a judgment on whether they are legitimate not due until November.

Thousands of celebrities, sportsmen, City grandees and politicians have put £2 billion into film production, and then used the investment to slash their tax bills.

Ingenious has always claimed the schemes are legitimate and aimed at boosting film production while allowing investors to defer – but not avoid – paying tax. 

However, HMRC officials disagree, and they are now understood to be sending out notices to investors which demand payment by December 29 

Last night, Sky Sports commentator Gower said he had not had such a notice.

A spokesman for Beckham said the former England captain had not received a letter either, but added the star always paid his taxes in full.

Mr Mitchell, a former Chief Whip, failed to return calls.

Ingenious said: ‘Ingenious film partnerships are not tax avoidance schemes. They are commercial production partnerships which have produced scores of successful films.’
