They're the undisputed kings of television light entertainment, as hosts of Britain’s Got Talent and I’m A Celebrity .  .  . Get Me Out Of Here!

But today Ant and Dec will reveal how they feared their careers were over after a phone-in scandal that affected millions of TV viewers and led to ITV being fined more than £5 million.

The pair, Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, are the castaways on today’s Desert Island Discs.

Anthony McPartlin and Declan Donnelly confess to Kirsty Young on Desert Island Disks that the TV phone-in scandal had them fearing for their jobs

They recall the furore that engulfed their former shows Ant & Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway and Ant & Dec’s Gameshow Marathon when it was discovered that viewers paying to take part in phone-in competitions had no real chance of winning.

The stars, executive producers on both the affected shows, insist they were totally in the dark about the scam.

McPartlin says: ‘It was the worst part of our career. I think our audience trust us but we were really worried that that trust had gone.’

And Donnelly adds: ‘I thought that was 
going to be it. We couldn’t comprehend how it was allowed to happen. If 
that had been the end, I don’t think we could have had many complaints.’

Two of Ant and Dec's shows were affected including Saturday Night Takeaway

The duo, who have been best friends for 25 years and live three doors apart, also talk about the ‘great love’ they share for each other – and joke that it sometimes feels that there are ‘three people’ in McPartlin’s seven-year marriage to make-up artist Lisa.

McPartlin tells host Kirsty Young: ‘There is a great love between the pair of us and I would really miss him if I was cast away on an island.’

Desert Island Discs is on  BBC Radio 4 today at 11.15am.
