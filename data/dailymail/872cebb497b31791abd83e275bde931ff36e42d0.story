A mob that killed a bull with machetes, rocks, knives and sticks during a festival in a northern Colombian town has incited a new debate about animal rights in the country.

Dozens of people in Turbaco, near Colombia's northern coast, chased the bull, taunting and harrying the animal until it was exhausted, then slowly beat it to death.

Amid calls for a fresh debate on traditions involving animal cruelty, activists and even some government officials are demanding legal action after footage of the killing emerged. 

Death in the afternoon: Youths stomp and beat an exhausted bull during a festival in the northern Colombian town of Turbaco, an incident which has sparked calls in the country for a new debate on animal cruelty

Sport or tragedy? The bull was killed during a 'corraleja', a kind of anything-goes amateur bullfight held in some parts of Colombia, in which anyone is allowed to take part 

One-sided: The video footage, shot from the stands of a large bullring, shows dozens of have-a-go toreros who pelt the bull with stones and bottles, kick it and even, reports claim, cut it with machetes

The killing took place during a 'corraleja', a kind of amateur bullfight held in some towns in the South American country. Anyone is allowed to take part.

The video footage, shot from the stands of a large bullring, shows dozens of have-a-go toreros taunting and chasing the bull, flashing makeshift capes in front of its face to confuse and infuriate it.

Soon it is exhausted and injured and unable to move any longer. But unlike the traditional bullfight, here there is no swift kill with a sword aimed directly at the heart.

Instead the animal is surrounded by dozens of baying youths who pelt it with stones and bottles, kick it and even, according to reports, cut it with machetes. Some even jump on its body.

Public Defender Jorge Otarola called the images 'Dante-esque, painful and inhumane'.

'The state’s intervention is needed because, even though traditions should be respected, they must be updated to reduce the suffering of animals,' he told The Associated Press.

Colombia's Environment Minister Gabriel Vallejo also intervened. He told Colombia's Blu Radio: 'I have to say it is totally barbaric, where people with sticks, stones and knives, and with utter cruelty, kill the bull.'

The Ministry of Culture released a statement calling for severe punishments for the 'barbaric' incident and demanding a public debate about whether such festivals should be allowed to continue.

Tradition: Colombian law bans mistreatment of animals, but exempts traditions like bullfighting

The justice ministry said it was starting an investigation to identify those responsible. But Turbaco Mayor Myron Martinez defended the festival, saying it was a local tradition.

'In "corraleja" festivals there are always injuries, there are always animals beaten and horses killed,' Martinez told AP.

'These are the kinds of incidents that form part of the traditions and customs of such festivals.'

The bull’s death has reopened the debate over bullfighting in Colombia.

 In the capital, Bogota, bullfighting has been banned, but such events remain popular in other parts of the country.

And it may be a long time before a lasting change. 

Although Colombian law bans the mistreatment of animals, it exempts rodeos, bullfights and corraleja-type events which are deeply rooted in folk tradition.
