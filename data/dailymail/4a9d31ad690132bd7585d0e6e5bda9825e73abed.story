A driver who broke down in motorway roadworks died today after he was hit by own car when it was struck by a lorry.

The man in his 50s was walking along the hard shoulder of the M25 when the white Renault lorry smashed into his stationery Ford Focus near the junction at Godstone, Surrey.

He was then hit by his car and suffered severe injuries. Paramedics treated him at the scene for severe injuries but he was pronounced dead at about half an hour later.

The man was one of two people killed today while walking on motorways after a 18-year-old woman was knocked down at junction 10 of the M65 in Burnley.

Surrey Police said the male driver's blue Focus had its lights turned off at the time.

It is believed the man got out of his car when it broke down in the roadworks near the clockwise junction 6 of the M25 at about 4.30am.

He was walking along the hard shoulder - which is being used as a live lane in the roadworks - when the crash happened.

A passenger who was still inside the Focus was treated at the scene for minor injuries.

A spokesman Surrey Police, which is appealing for witnesses, said no one had been arrested in connection with the crash.

He added: 'The collision occurred in a section of the motorway where there are currently road works in place.

'Initial reports suggest that a blue Ford Focus had stopped in one of the 
live lanes with the lights off and that one of the occupants had left 
the vehicle and was walking along the hard shoulder.

'The collision has 
then occurred with a white Renault lorry colliding with the stationary 
Ford Focus and further colliding with the pedestrian.'

The motorway was closed for hours at junction 6, causing huge rush hour tailback as motorists were diverted off the motorway.

The fatal crash caused eight mile long tailbacks today

The Highways Agency said traffic was backed up for eight miles and reached Junction 4.

In Burnley, the teenage woman was walking along the eastbound carriageway of the M65 at about 4am when she was hit by a white sprinter van.

The 48-year-old local driver of the van was treated at the scene for shock.

The carriageway was closed for three hours for accident investigation work.

Police said woman has been identified and her family has been informed.

Sergeant Tracey Ward from the Road Policing Unit said the force isÂ  appealing for witnesses.

An investigation is underway to establish exactly what happened and why the woman was on the motorway.

Sgt Ward said: 'Her family have been informed and specially trained family liaison officers are supporting them through this terrible ordeal.'
