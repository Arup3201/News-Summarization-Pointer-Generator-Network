When a marriage falls apart, even the angriest of husbands probably wouldn’t bother laying claim to his wife’s shoes.

But then, most wives don’t have a footwear collection worth $1million (£640,000).

Hedge fund manager Daniel Shak is suing his ex-wife, Beth, for 35 per cent of all the shoes she owns, claiming she kept them hidden as they thrashed out a $3.25million (£2m) divorce settlement.

Surrounded: Beth Shak with some of her 1,200 pairs of designer heels. She claims it was an obsession bordering on illness

Substitute for love: Mrs Shak said 'There was such a lack of emotion and love in my relationship that I filled that void with shopping... I couldn't stop'

Mr Shak alleges she hoarded the 1,200 
pairs – more than half of which are by Christian Louboutin – in a 
‘secret room’ in their exclusive apartment.

But Mrs Shak, a 
professional poker player, branded her ex-husband’s move as harassment, 
said he must have known about the shoes – and vowed to ‘fight him all 
the way’.

The couple, who have three children together, split up in 
2009. Mr Shak remained in their $7.4million apartment, which he has 
since sold for a $200,000 profit.

Last year, however, he lost a 
reported $7million on the gold market. He has now filed the lawsuit 
against his ex-wife.

It states: ‘In the summer of 2011, Daniel became 
aware that Beth owned and failed to disclose an extensive … collection 
of Christian Louboutin shoes … and other high-end designer shoes.

Beth is working on her new shoe website, Shoes R Forever, which was inspired by her new boyfriend Ben Cook

‘Dan
 trusted his wife and was not inspecting his home to try to find 
inventory or “secret rooms’’.’ The collection is indeed vast and 
includes 700 pairs of Louboutins, costing from $700 to $4,000.

That, 
combined with her reputation as a World Series poker player, has made 
Mrs Shak something of a celebrity in the U.S. She has appeared on 
television to discuss her shoe habit, and is starting to design her own 
range of footwear.

The 42-year-old’s devotion to Louboutin is such 
that she has described his creations as ‘fine art’ and even has a tattoo
 of one of his heels.

The collection includes dozens of pairs of 
strappy silver sandals, black kitten heels and leopard print pumps, all 
in her own size seven (UK size 4).

Beth and her staggering collection have featured on MTV Cribs and the Today show

Mrs Shak’s most expensive shoes are a pair of 
black and white cowboy boots once owned by Elizabeth Taylor. She keeps 
them in a glass cabinet of their own with a framed picture of the 
actress on the wall above, although she refused to reveal how much they 
cost.

She now lives in a luxurious house near Philadelphia with her 
two youngest children Lindy, 17, and Austin, 15 – and has four storage 
areas around the property for all her footwear.

The main closet, which 
can only be entered using a numerical keypad, is 12ft by 8ft and has 
eight racks, each full of shoes, going from the floor to the ceiling.

A second room also has a numerical keypad and is 4ft by 5ft.

There is also a separate rack in another room, where she keeps her formal shoes, and another cupboard for the remainder.

Mrs
 Shak claims she has always funded her habit with her poker winnings, 
although by some counts she has won only $500,000 during her six years 
in the game.

She said: ‘There are shoes that I don’t even remember 
buying. I’m so short of space I had to give a couple of hundred pairs 
away.

‘Sometimes I pull a pair out that I don’t remember and feel like I got a pair of shoes for free.’

She
 added that  it would be ‘ludicrous’ if she had actually kept her habit a
 secret from her husband when they shared the apartment in New York.

‘I’m shaking my head over this whole thing,’ she said. ‘He is saying he didn’t know the closet in our master bedroom existed.’

Daniel Shak believes the value of the collection may entitle him to hundreds of thousands of dollars more in their divorce settlement

New home: Mrs Shak has moved into this new home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her shoes are in special closets that require a PIN code to enter

Asked
 if she has become addicted, she said: ‘I don’t have an addiction to 
shoes because they’re a want, and definitely not a need.’ Mrs Shak’s 
collection beats that of Mariah Carey, who reportedly owns 1,000 pairs.

But
 it’s smaller than Celine Dion’s, who is said to own around 3,000 – the 
same number collected by Imelda Marcos, the infamous first lady of the 
Philippines. Asked if she gets compared to Marcos, Mrs Shak laughed: 
‘Yes, it’s so bad!’

Mr Shak, 52, who runs SHK Asset Management in 
New York, said: ‘I take offence at her statement where she says I am 
claiming to have no knowledge of her master bathroom closet.’

The case is now going through the courts.
