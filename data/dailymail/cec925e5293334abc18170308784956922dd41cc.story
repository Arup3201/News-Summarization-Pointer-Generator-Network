The 36-year-old man was arrested on Wednesday afternoon after Phillip Koklas was found with serious injuries after allegedly falling from the fifth balcony of a building in Upper Roma Street in Brisbane city of Queensland.

The 28-year-old is believed to have broken 'almost every bone in his body' and remains in a serious condition at the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.

The Mango Street man was charged with attempted murder, kidnapping, and grievous bodily harm, two counts of burglary and four counts of deprivation of liberty.

Phillip Koklas (pictured), 28, was taken to hospital and remains in critical condition after he allegedly fell from an apartment balcony in Brisbane's CBD on Sunday morning

The father of the balcony fall victim, Peter Koklas last saw his son when he went to breakfast on Sunday morning but less than two hours later, Phillip was in intensive care.

Peter Koklas told Nine News: 'The hospital called to say that Phillip was in a coma - had fallen from a building. I was just shocked, I didn't know what to think,' his father said.

'I think he gets along with people, he's not one to go looking for trouble.

'I just want to appeal to members of the public - if anybody saw or heard anything or knows anything, if they could just come forward and tell the police.'

Nine News reports that Mr Koklas has a fractured skull, swelling on the brain and almost every bone in his body is broken and doctors have said that his entire face will need to be reconstructed.
