A 25-year-old carer went into hospital with a nose bleed and came out in a wheelchair, unable to walk unaided.

Megan Taylor, from Blackburn, suffered a severe allergic reaction to a drug which, she says, had been blacklisted on her medical notes.

Ms Taylor has a blood clotting disorder and was admitted to A&E with a nose bleed but the bleeding did not stop and she became nauseous.

Megan Taylor, 25, went into hospital with a nose bleed and came out in a wheelchair after suffering a severe allergic reaction to a drug she says doctors should never have given her

Medics at Royal Blackburn Hospital, Lancashire, gave her the anti-sickness drug Metoclopramide.

Ms Taylor says they ignored her medical notes, which warned of a previous severe reaction to the drug.

She says she now suffers repeated muscle spasms down her left side, cannot walk unaided, is unable to work and has spent the past month in a rehabilitation unit.

East Lancashire Hospitals Trust, which runs Royal Blackburn, is investigating her claims.

It has not admitted any error, but declined to comment while its investigation is continuing.

Ms Taylor and her partner Craig Hodgson, claim her allergy to Metoclopramide was documented in her patient notes after a previous adverse reaction.

‘Distressing muscle or movement disorders’ are among the recognised side effects of Metoclopramide, while the NHS Choices website warns that ‘some people should never use it’.

Ms Taylor says she was given an anti-sickness drug at Royal Blackburn Hospital even though her medical notes said she was allergic to it and had suffered a previous reaction

Mr Hodgson says Ms Taylor had suffered similar symptoms after being given the drug several years ago at the Royal Blackburn, when the allergy was discovered, although the symptoms were less severe.

Her mobility and muscle strength gradually improved after that episode, and the couple are hopeful she can recover again this time.

Metoclopramide is a treatment for nausea and vomiting and stomach discomfort.

It also helps to restore normal gut movement after surgery.

It works by increasing the action of the muscles in the gastrointestinal tract so that food moves more quickly from the stomach to the lower gut.

The drug is not suitable for everyone and the NHS says 'some people should never use it'.

It should not be given to people who are allergic to any of the ingredients.

Side effects of taking the drug can include blood problems, breast enlargement in men, breathing difficulties, confusion, depression, eyesight problems, anxiety, dizziness, drowsiness, skin problems and raised blood pressure.

The father-of-two, who works as a gardener, said: ‘The reaction to the drug seems to have killed the left side of her body and she’s having repeated fits. Last week she had about 20 fits or episodes in one day.

‘She needs 24-hour care at the moment and we’re struggling to cope.

‘I don’t think it’s acceptable at all because it’s a basic thing to get right. If they haven’t got time to have a look at your notes what chance have patients got?’

Ms Taylor was in hospital after suffering a severe nose bleed at the start of October.

Mr Hodgson took her to the emergency ward, where staff struggled to stop the bleeding and she started feeling sick.

She said she was then admitted and given Metoclopramide over the course of four days, despite the allergy being stated in her notes.

Ms Taylor, step-mother to Mr Hodgson’s children, then remained in hospital for observations and began to suffer spasms and restricted movement.

And according to the couple, medics 
said she would urgently need to see a neurologist at Royal Preston 
Hospital, who could diagnose problems with her nervous system.

But they say this only happened yesterday due to mistakes and delays in the referral process between Blackburn and Preston.

Ms Taylor now suffers repeated spasms down her left side, is unable to walk unaided, cannot work and has been in a rehabilitation unit for the last month - last time she had a reaction to the drug she eventually recovered her strength so is hoping the same will happen again

She was discharged to a rehabilitation unit on October 22, where she remains now.

Mr Hodgson said: ‘Right at the beginning, the doctors in A&E said she needed to see a neurologist urgently, and we made numerous requests over the last six weeks, but they failed to come up with an appointment until yesterday. It’s farcical and we just seemed to be getting fobbed off.’

Ms Taylor said: ‘The whole experience 
has been horrible. This has put so much pressure on my family and it 
doesn’t feel like the hospitals want to help me. We are considering 
taking legal action now.’

The couple have lodged a formal complaint but are taking legal advice before submitting a second complaint, relating to the allergic reaction.

Rineke Schram, medical director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the Royal Blackburn, said: ‘We take any concerns regarding clinical care very seriously.

‘We can confirm that we received a letter of concern from the family on November 15 2013. The concerns raised by the family did not include any reference to the alleged adverse drug reaction. However, we will ensure that this concern is investigated as part of the overall complaint.’
