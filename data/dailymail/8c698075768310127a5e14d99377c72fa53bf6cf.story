A record 400,000 homeowners are now property millionaires – twice as many as five years ago.

The number of homes worth  £1million or more has jumped by a third over the past year alone, fuelled by soaring house prices in London and the South East.

A report found that 255 homeowners have been promoted to the exclusive club every day.

Pricey: The total number of homes valued at £1 million plus by Zoopla this month has grown by almost one third compared with a year ago to reach 393,127. Homes around Hampstead Heath in North London are pictured

But the rise means that, in some 
areas, young couples looking to move from a flat to a house to start a 
family are forced to take on crippling mortgages.  

And
 house prices are still rising, according to figures published 
separately yesterday by the Office for National Statistics. Property 
prices in the UK have risen by 5.5 per cent over the last 12 months, 
although the rise in London is even steeper, jumping by 12 per cent.

In fact, prices are rising by only 3.1 per cent in Britain, if London and the South East are removed from the calculation.

Of
 all property millionaires, six in ten are in London, including around 
41,400 who live in the capital’s smallest borough of Kensington and 
Chelsea.

The highest proportion of property millionaires outside the capital can be found in the Surrey postcode area of GU25 covering Virginia Water (right)

The report, by 
property website Zoopla, found that around 240,000 property  
millionaires are in London and around 82,600 are in the South East.

There
 is more mortgage debt in south west London than in the whole of Wales, 
according to the first-ever analysis of mortgages by postcodes in the 
UK.

In south west London, 
which includes areas such as Wimbledon, Wandsworth, Balham, Earlsfield 
and Clapham, homeowners are burdened with a total mortgage debt of 
£29.2billion.

By 
comparison, homeowners in Wales have a total mortgage debt of 
£28.5billion, according to the research by the Council of Mortgage 
Lenders and the British Bankers’ Association.

It highlights the extraordinary gulf between house prices in London and the rest of the country.

The
 average house price in Wales is £164,000, which is one of the cheapest 
places to buy in the country, compared with an average of £437,000 in 
London.

By
 comparison, there are only 1,043 in all of Wales, 1,814 in Yorkshire 
and the Humber and 2,574 in the North East. Lawrence Hall, from Zoopla, 
said: ‘There has been a hive of activity propelling house price growth 
at the top end.’

Outside 
London, the highest  proportion of property millionaires are in the 
Surrey town of Virginia Water, where a third of houses are worth more 
than £1million.

Other 
millionaire hotspots include the Buckinghamshire towns of Beaconsfield 
and Chalfont St Giles. In the exclusive Royal Borough of Kensington and 
Chelsea, the average price of a home is now £1.2million.

A decade ago, the average price there was £470,000, according to the Land Registry.

Peter
 Rollings, chief executive of estate agency Marsh & Parsons, said 
the property market in the capital ‘dances to a different beat.’  He 
said: ‘Prices are rising at more than twice the speed of other regions.

‘Prime London continues to be a magnet for both UK and overseas buyers, and demand for the best properties remains intense.

‘We
 have recorded an average  of 19 registered buyers per available 
property, and until levels of  supply increase, property will continue 
to sell quickly, for close to, or  for the asking price, and in many 
cases, in excess of the asking price.’

SOUGHT-AFTER AREA

Chris Wreghitt and his wife Wendy bought their six-bedroom detached property in Powick, Worcestershire, for  £270,000 in 1999. It is now worth £1million.

Mr Wreghitt said: ‘We’ve done quite a lot of work on it including converting the cellars which were flooded and closed off into a games room for the children.

‘I’d say we spent around £100,000 altogether. But I didn’t think when we bought it that it would be worth as much as it is now.’

Mr Wreghitt, 55, runs an export sales company. The Grade II listed property also includes a coach house which he uses as his office.

He said: ‘It’s a nice village in a sought-after area. It also offers a good choice of both comprehensive and independent schools.’

He and his wife, a 52-year-old primary school teacher, have three children – Sam, 23, Katie, 21, and Jack, 15.

THE LONDON EFFECT

The Curran's House

Piers Curran sold his five-bedroom Victorian townhouse in Wandsworth Common in July for just over £1.2million – eight years after he bought it for £495,000.

Mr Curran, 35, and his wife Su, 35, had spent £200,000 on a loft conversion.

The couple, who have two children aged seven and four, moved from Putney because they preferred the schools.

They have now moved to a  £1.65million house nearby.

Mr Curran, head of proprietary trading firm Amplify Trading, said: ‘I was surprised how much we sold it for in the end, even though I monitor the property market closely and know prices in London have shot up.’

‘We accepted an offer in February for £1.18million but we couldn’t find a property for ourselves so pulled out.

'We put it back on the market in July and sold it within 24 hours for £37,000 more than we asked for.’
