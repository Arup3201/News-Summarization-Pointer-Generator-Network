Police have seized some of world’s fastest and most desirable supercars in a crackdown on uninsured drivers, including a classic Bentley, a Tron-style Lamborghini - and also a £1million crane.

Scotland Yard has impounded 100,000 uninsured vehicles in London since October 2011, among them valuable McLarens, Bentleys and BMWs.

In November 2013, a six-litre Bentley 
Continental GTC was seized in Bromley after the driver was found to be 
uninsured, and in October last year, a £400,000 customised Lamborghini 
Aventador was taken off the road when the motorist’s insurance policy 
was found to not cover such an expensive vehicle.

Other supercars seized in the last year include a Lamborghini Gallardo, Porsche Boxsters and a Lamborghini Spyder.

Uninsured drivers face six penalty points
 and a £300, and they could also see their cars either sold at auction 
or crushed if they fail to reclaim them in time.

A police spokesperson said: 'It needs to 
be stressed that the MPS does not just focus on high value cars but any 
vehicle that is not being driven in accordance with the law.

'High value cars are not automatically sent to be crushed. If the owner doesn’t come and collect them within a designated time, they will be auctioned off.

'Uninsured drivers are five times more likely to be involved in a road collision, and many are more likely to be involved in criminal activity.'

Since 
Operation Cubo began, the Met has raised more than £5.5 million at 
auction by selling seized vehicles, including selling a bright orange 
Aventador for £218,000.

MPS
 Commander Stephen Watson said: 'Operation Cubo is strong, visible 
action that demonstrates the MPS’ commitment and determination to 
serving the public and making London’s streets safer.

'Working
 alongside our partners we have achieved significant results through 
large scale seizures of uninsured and un-roadworthy vehicles.'

He added: 
'While in addition making numerous arrests of suspects wanted in 
connection to a variety of offences, some of which impact negatively on 
our communities such as drugs and firearms related.

'We are targeting criminals by denying them the use of the roads so it’s much harder for them to commit crime.

'We
 have arrested robbers, burglars and rapists as a result of Operation 
Cubo and will continue to arrest these people as they attempt to travel 
around the capital.

'We’re also helping to make London’s roads safer for all that use them and will continue our efforts.'
