Shameful: Amrik Gill, 26, called his time in jail 'the best holiday ever' and wished he could stay longer

A serial fraudster sent to jail for 18 months has boasted that his sentence was ‘the best holiday ever’.

And Amrik Gill, 26, even had the cheek to thank taxpayers for funding his jail term.

In one of a number of posts on Twitter after his release, he wrote: ‘Just had the best holiday ever. Would like to thank the tax payer for making it possible.’

Referring to the number of letters permitted in each tweet he added: ‘140 characters is like 18 months ... Not long enough.’

Gill has been jailed six times for scamming football supporters and music fans out of thousands of pounds after falsely advertising tickets for events over the internet.

He was jailed at Manchester Crown Court in January for taking cash for football and concert tickets he did not possess, but was released halfway through his 18-month sentence.

Last night a spokesman for Families Against Crime said: ‘This conman has defrauded dozens of innocent people out of thousands of pounds yet he has still not learnt his lesson.

‘It is disgraceful that after his release from prison on licence he should immediately take to Twitter and deride the criminal justice system. Surely this is a breach of his licence and illustrates he is not ready to be released and should be returned to prison to complete his sentence

The average cost of each prisoner is £34,700 a year, according to the latest figures from the Ministry of Justice.

Manchester councillor Norman Lewis said: ‘He’s just sticking his fingers up to the law and to society .

‘Individuals like this are just callous people who don’t give a damn about how they get their money.

‘Let’s hope if he carries on offending now he’s out of prison, he gets a longer sentence fit for purpose.’

Tony Lloyd, police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester, added: ‘Gill had 140 characters – it’s a real shame he didn’t use them to apologise to his victims.’

Bragging: Gill used Twitter to crow about how much he enjoyed prison and urged his local paper to print his comments

Last November Gill received a 
suspended sentence after admitting 18 frauds and asking for 57 offences 
to be taken into consideration.

He
was spared jail after Judge David Hernandez heard he was a compulsive 
gambler who needed help with his addiction. But only a month later Gill,
of Chorlton, was caught scamming a music fan on the website Gumtree.

He was sentenced to 18 months behind bars. When asked about his subsequent tweets Gill said he was ‘being sarcastic’.

A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘The prison regime is tougher than it has been for years and we plan to keep it that way.’
