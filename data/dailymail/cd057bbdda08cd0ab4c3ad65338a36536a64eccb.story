Real Madrid have dropped the Christian cross atop their official badge in a bid to appease new sponsors.

The Champions League holders have signed a lucrative deal with the National Bank of Abu Dhabi and as a result tinkered with their Los Blancos crest, according to Marca.

It is believed that the change is to pacify Muslim supporters in the UAE, although it hasn’t been altered outside the region.

President Florentino Perez was joined by Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos, Karim Benzema and Dani Carvajal at the announcement earlier this week.

‘I know that the local people experience every match in a special way and that our links with the UAE are constantly growing stronger,’ Perez said recently.

‘This agreement will help the club to keep conquering the hearts of followers in the United Arab Emirates.’
