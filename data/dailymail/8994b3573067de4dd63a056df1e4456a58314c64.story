From an eerie-looking android to a smartphone-controlled dinosaur, Japanese companies are out in full force to demonstrate their robotic prowess.

The technology is being shown by exhibitors at Ceatec 2014 in Japan, which is taking place in Chiba, near Tokyo until October 11.

One of the most popular devices is TE Connectivity's dinosaur robot, the TE Saurus, which lets users experience a close encounter with a 6ft 11 (2.1 metre-tall) reptile droid.

TE Saurus can also play trivia games as users answer questions through the app.

Another highlight is Omron's three-legged robot, which is capable of playing a relaxed game of ping pong.

It watches its human opponent to predict the ball's path, and can even decide to take it easy on opponents by missing a few hits.

Weebles may seem like basic toys now, but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘wobble but never fall down.’

To bring this childhood toy into the modern-day, a Japanese firm has created a troop of Weeble-style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball.

And thanks to built-in gyroscopes and infrared sensors, the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over.

The Murata Cheerleaders were built by Murata Manufacturing. Instead of wheels, the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball, which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move.

They remain upright due to three advanced gyro sensors, which incorporate inverted-pendulum control technology, to detect tilt angles.

Similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras, car navigation systems, and more recently, the electronic stability control (ESC) systems that prevent cars from skidding.

Each robot is equipped with four infrared sensors, and five ultrasonic microphones to detect surrounding objects, even in the dark.

And, based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves, this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet (16 metre square) space. 

With five motors to control paddle movement, it is programmed to serve the ball in a way that makes it easy for the player to return.

'This ping pong robot is really a demonstration of how a robot can interact with a person and react in an appropriate manner,' said Takuya Tsuyuguchi, an Omron manager.

'We envision this robot perhaps being used in a factory or production line and having a role in which it would have to interact with a worker to do or build something.

'This would involve the robot understanding the needs of its human counterpart and behaving appropriately.'

Toshiba also demonstrated its life-like communications android named Ms Aiko Chihira. 

Ms Chihira uses sign language to introduce itself to humans.

Toshiba describes the eerie android, which has blinking eyes and a fixed smile, as having the appearance of 'a friendly young woman.'

At present, the android can mimic only simple movements, such as exchanging greetings and signing in Japanese.

But the company soon hopes to integrate its technologies in areas including sensing, speech synthesis, speech recognition and robotic control to create a more social robot by 2020.

The goal is to design a companion for the elderly and people with dementia, to offer telecounselling in natural speech, communicate through sign language, and allow healthcare to keep an eye on elderly people.

Meanwhile a group of 14-inch (36cm) tall cheerleader robots showcased their flawless choreography. 

Murata manufacturing, an electronic component manufacturer, presented the cheerleaders with colour-changing pom-poms that use gyroscopic sensors to roll on spherical bases in unison without losing their balance.

'These robots use our proprietary balancing technology combined with technology that prevents, in real time, the robots from clashing together,' said Tomoyuki Mori, a Murata engineer.

Over 500 companies and organisations are exhibiting at Ceatec Japan, which will be held until October 11 in Chiba, east of Tokyo.
