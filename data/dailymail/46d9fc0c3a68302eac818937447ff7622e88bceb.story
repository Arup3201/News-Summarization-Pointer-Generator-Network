A photography series has captured one family's struggle to come to terms with a beloved grandfather's Alzheimer's disease.

Called 'Life with Pito,' the photos were taken by Ginger Unzueta, a Central-Florida based photographer.

Unzueta felt compelled to begin the project as she saw her father-in-law, nicknamed Pito, struggle with Alzheimer's disease.

'I felt God pushing me to capture him through the lens,' Unzueta writes on her website.

'I wanted to be able to capture moments of him now - not always pretty moments, but his life as it is,' she added. 'I feel our family needs these memories. These memories are a part of his story, just as much as his childhood memories are.'

The photos show Pito hugging and embracing loved ones, as well as being guided to help with daily tasks.

Unzueta first learned of Pito's diagnosis in 2007, when her husband was overseas in Iraq. During a satellite call to relatives, Unzueta's brother-in-law broke the news, she writes.

Unzueta says Pito's case is made worse by the fact that 'his mind was his life.' A doctor, Pito reportedly specialized in pediatrics and sought stimulation, including reading up on medicine playing tennis.

Pito's conditon is now so severe, Unzueta says, that he has trouble recognizing his own family.

'Sadly, he has progressed to the point where he mostly doesn't recognize his wife of over 40 years and his four sons,' she writes. 'He now just sits around the house, talking to himself and to the photos on the walls.'

Unzueta credits her mother-in-law with the strength to take care of her husband, as well as offer to support other family members with meals and helping take care of children.

'She has good and bad days with Pito, but she says that she would rather have him like this than not at all,' she writes.

'Even through the heartbreak of Pito not recognizing her, the woman he courted as a nurse in the hospital where he worked after graduating from medical school, she still manages to love and serve him. She says he deserves this, for being such a devoted loving husband and father for so many years.'
