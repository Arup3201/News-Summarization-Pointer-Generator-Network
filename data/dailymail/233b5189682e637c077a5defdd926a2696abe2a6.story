It is no longer only the Duchess of Cambridge who can cause a frenzied sales boom whenever she appears in public wearing a new dress, carrying a new umbrella or walking a new dog.

Kate's grandmother-in-law is now giving the younger royal a run for her money in the fashion department.

Queen Elizabeth's beloved handbag designer, Launer London, has seen yet another enormous spike in sales of their elegant, box-shaped bags, after their most loyal patron was photographed carrying several different models during her Diamond Jubilee weekend.

Following the long weekend of public 
celebrations earlier this month - during which Her Majesty was ever-armed with one of three bespoke black Launer London creations - the label has reported a 58 per cent surge in sales of similar models.

Most popular were the pink and green pastel bags, and the label's new metallic bronze, silver and gold ones, designed in honour of the Olympic Games.

Indeed, so desperate were so many to 
emulate the Queen's unique style, that the Launer.com site experienced a 
mass overload and crashed.

Gerald Bodmer, managing director and creative director of Launer, told the Telegraph: 'The Royal Family still means huge business for the UK, and there is still a big international appetite for any and all things associated with royalty.

'What we have seen here is more requests in trend-led designs, with customers seeking to put their own stamp on our signature bags.

Who knows; this time next year the Queen may have foregone her traditional black and be sporting one of our lovely bags in colour pop.'

Fit for a Queen: In honour of the Olympics, Launer has designed a range of metallic bags in colours to represent the medals

Launer - who create four new designs especially for the Queen every year - experienced a similar, 60 per cent swell in sales last April, after Her Majesty was seen by millions of people carrying one of their white handbags to her grandson Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton.

Interestingly, 20 per cent of that sales increase was attributed to the 35 to 50 demographic (buyers are asked to give
their age when buying online), showing the Queen's influence on a 
younger audience.

Previously, Launer customers have been more than 50 years old.

The 
company, which was established in London in 1941, has been supplying the Royal Household since 1968, when it was granted a Royal Warrant by Her Majesty the Queen.

Launer bags are sold in Selfridges,
John Lewis and Fortnum & Mason, with prices ranging from £410 to £1,057.

'When Sam Launer came to England from Czechoslovakia over 60 years ago, he brought with him an idea that has remained with the company to this day; handbags and leather goods should be elegant, be formed out of the best materials and made by highly skilled craftspeople.'Over the last twenty five years Launer has built up an enviable reputation as a very high quality manufacturer with distinctively good styling, and currently hold the Royal Warrant to HM The Queen for handbags and small leather goods.'Launer's trademark is understated, elegant and classic - beautiful leather articles made with pride by craftsmen and women using traditional skills. With care, they give years of pleasure and service.'The Launer factory is in Walsall, near Birmingham, the traditional home of leather goods manufacturing in England.'Launer wallets, card cases, purses and handbags are handmade in the softest calf, exotic lizard, and ostrich skin. Every attention is paid to detail, and gold plated fittings feature the Launer rope emblem, the perfect finishing touch.'
