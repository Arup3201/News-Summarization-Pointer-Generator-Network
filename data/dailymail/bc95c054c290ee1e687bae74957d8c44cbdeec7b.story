Manchester City face Roma at the Stadio Olimpico in a match which could end their dream of winning their first Champions League trophy.

Manuel Pellegrini's side have to better CSKA Moscow's result against Bayern Munich if they are to make it through to the last-16.

Here Jamie Redknapp analyses how Manchester City can claim all three points against their Italian opponents.

GET READY FOR THE MIDFIELD GENERAL

Daniele De Rossi is an old-fashioned fighter of a midfielder. He plays with great aggression and I love the way he has stuck with Roma. There must be something about the club that makes players want to stay.

Like his captain Francesco Totti, 31-year-old De Rossi is a one-club man and the fans love him for it. Before him I liked watching Giuseppe Giannini, who spent 15 years at Roma, and I almost went there myself when Giannini left.

De Rossi loves snapping into tackles and he’s good in possession. He is one of the finest defensive midfielders in Europe but City must be careful not to show him too much respect.

If they do then he is capable of the kind of dominant display that will whip the crowd into a frenzy.

ATTACKING OPTIONS COULD BE RISKY 

Sergio Aguero has carried City at times this season but with him injured, Manuel Pellegrini faces a selection headache. Does he stick to his principles and play two up front or does he put an extra man in midfield? 

Pellegrini tends to be quite stubborn in the way he plays and though Edin Dzeko can lead the line alone, he doesn’t offer enough defensively. City must win so Pellegrini might be tempted to go with Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic, but being too open is a big risk.

BEWARE THE KING OF ROME 

Surely a 38-year-old should not be capable of affecting a game of this magnitude? Think again. Francesco Totti  is a living legend at Roma. The fans worship the ground he walks on and he is playing in his theatre. 

It might be a cliche to call Totti a gladiator but that’s how the fans see him. He is battle-hardened, and he knows just what it takes to win a game like this. He has never had to rely on speed because his brain is always one step ahead. 

He scored Roma’s goal in the 1-1 draw at the Etihad and this game could be decided by a single moment of genius. That’s why Totti is such a threat — we know he is more than capable of producing one.

 YANGA-MBIWA COULD LEAVE ROMA IN RUINS

There is no guarantee he will play, but one man I would like to see starting for Roma is Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa. He is a complete liability — he is always likely to pick up a booking and is a mistake waiting to happen. And who did he concede four against on his debut for Newcastle last season? Man City. They could do with a repeat performance from the centre half.

 WHICH GERVINHO WILL TURN UP? 

The problem with Gervinho is he is so hit and miss. Yes, he’s an improved player since he left Arsenal, where we didn’t see the best of him, but if he lashes one in the top corner one week, the next it will end up in Row Z. But that’s why he’s so dangerous. City have to be aware of him because if he is switched on, he has the potential to cause them big problems.
