She may be tiny, but Milly the Puerto Rican chihuahua is on the verge of something big - being officially recognised as the most petite pooch on the planet.

The current record holder is Boo Boo, another chihuahua from the U.S state of Kentucky, but Milly, who lives with her Argentine owners in the north east Puerto Rican town of Vega Alta, hopes to punch above her 170g weight to earn her place in the Guinness Book of Records.

After she was born three months ago the family believed that Milly would grow, but having maintained the same height of just 6.53cm for three weeks they began to think that the pedigree pup might be able to knock Boo Boo from the top dog spot that she has held since February 2008.

Dog-eared: The owners of Milly the chihuahua are going to present the 
dog to the Guinness Book of Records because they believe she is the 
smallest in the world

Pocket pedigree: Weighing just 170gms and measuring a miniscule 6.53cm in height the chihuahua from Puerto Rico requires special care

Measuring in at 10.16cm Boo Boo towers over the new pretender to the throne and miniscule Milly's carer Rivera Eizzal believes her pedigree puppy has got it in the (doggy) bag.

Ms Eizzal, said:  'Milly
was so small she could not breastfeed due to the tiny size of her mouth.

'To get an idea of
​​just how petite she is, when she was first born she received milk from an eyedropper.'

The 
animal is constantly accompanied by Ms Eizzil or by her owner, 
Argentinian Vanessa Semler, who is dedicated to rearing chihuahuas in 
Puerto Rico.

Puppy love: Milly is three months old and has maintained the same height since she was just three weeks old

Beautiful bowwow: At the same age as Milly is now current World's Smallest Dog Boo Boo was more than twice as big

Ms
Semler says caring for Milly takes effort, but explains that she and 
her husband, Edwin Davila, have no children so they have the time to 
focus their energies on their pet project.

A judge from the Guinness Book of Records is due to travel to Puerto Rico in the coming months to clarify Milly's size and measurements which will then be sent from the island to be officially confirmed.

Chihuahuas originated from the state of Mexico that carries same name and they usually reach a height of between 15cm and 25cm.

Boo Boo is a long-haired, female chihuahua who is owned by Lana Elswick of Raceland, Kentucky.

Dog fight: Boo Boo, a long-haired, female chihuahua is the current
