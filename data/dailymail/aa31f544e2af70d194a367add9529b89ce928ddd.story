Appearing on the cover of Newsweek, Barack Obama looks coy, half-smiling, half-surprised, gracefully clutching his suit jacket slung over his shoulder.

It might appear to be some sort of watch advertisement were it not for Niall Ferguson's blazing headline 'Hit the Road, Barack: Why We Need a New President.'

The article sizes him up on his economic and foreign relations accomplishments, as well as announces the rise of his apparent new nemesis: Paul Ryan.

Hey Girl: Newsweek's cover might appear to be some sort of watch advertisement were it not for Niall Ferguson's blazing headline 'Hit the Road, Barack: Why We Need a New President'

Niall Ferguson, a British professor of history at Harvard University, relies heavily on the idea of promises to lampoon Barack Obama into submission - a surprising argument for the historically liberal, and pro-Obama publication.

It is urgent, he argues, to lose the rhetoric and spring for reform.

'I was a good loser four years ago,' he writes. As a 'full disclosure' adviser to John McCain, his sentiments are hardly surprising, but he does not rely on opinion to make his case.

Drawing heavily on unemployment numbers, stagnant growth on the economy and expert dissatisfaction, he presents Mr Obama as a lame duck.

'It is five years since the financial crisis began, but the central problems—excessive financial concentration and excessive financial leverage—have not been addressed,' Mr Ferguson writes.

But more than just his policies are the problem, Mr Ferguson says, it's his decision making abilities.

Stop: Drawing heavily on unemployment numbers, stagnant growth on the economy and expert dissatisfaction, he presents Mr Obama as a lame duck

'After the imperial presidency of the Bush era, there was something more like parliamentary government in the first two years of Obama’s administration,' Mr Ferguson writes.

'The president proposed; Congress disposed.'

'The voters now face a stark choice,' Mr Ferguson says.

'They can let Barack Obama’s rambling, solipsistic narrative continue until they find themselves living in some American version of Europe, with low growth, high unemployment, even higher debt—and real geopolitical decline.'

The nail in the coffin will be Paul Ryan, Mr Ferguson argues. The two met in 2010 at a fundraising dinner.

Competition: It is urgent, the writer argues, to lose the rhetoric and spring for reform

'Ryan blew me away. I have wanted to see him in the White House ever since,' Mr Ferguson writes.

While Mr Ryan possesses the charm that Mr Obama once mastered, Mitt Romney harnesses the private sector experience, and leadership, that Mr Obama has always lacked.

'Now Obama is going head-to-head with his nemesis: a politician who believes more in content than in form, more in reform than in rhetoric,' Mr Ferguson writes.

His analysis is not without controversy, however, as New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has called him out on an error.

Reception: The public reception of the cover has been hot and cold

No Thanks: Some readers announced their allegiance to Newsweek, while other readers pronouncing their disdain

Reverse: Still, other readers thought the controversial cover might be a boost for Barack

'There are multiple errors and misrepresentations in Niall Ferguson’s cover story in Newsweek — I guess they don’t do fact-checking,' Mr Krugman writes on his blog.

He refers to this passage of the piece:

'The president pledged that health-care reform would not add a cent to the deficit. But the CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation now estimate that the insurance-coverage provisions of the ACA will have a net cost of close to $1.2 trillion over the 2012–22 period.'

And then declares:

'Readers are no doubt meant to interpret this as saying that CBO found that the Act will increase the deficit. But anyone who actually read, or even skimmed, the CBO report (pdf) knows that it found that the ACA would reduce, not increase, the deficit — because the insurance subsidies were fully paid for.'

He calls on Newsweek to correct the 'plain misrepresentation of the facts.'

POLITICO called out editor Tina Brown for the gaffe.

'Tina Brown certainly swings for the fences,' they write. 'She just puts a little too much pine tar on the bat.'

Spice: Since Tina Brown took the helm of the floundering publication, she has made it her mission to spice up the covers with controversial images of bondage or a heavily photoshopped Princess Diana

Since Mrs Brown took the helm of the floundering publication, she has made it her mission to spice up the covers with controversial images of bondage or a heavily Photoshopped Princess Diana.

The public reception of this cover has been hot and cold, with some readers announcing their allegiance to Newsweek, while others pronouncing their disdain.

The paper created the hashtag #HitTheRoadBarack to keep track of the discussion.

'I will never ever purchase another @Newsweek magazine #HitTheRoadBarack Thank You @nfergus #SubscriptionCanceled,' tweeted one reader.

'Chronic unemployment, stagnant economic growth, unsustainable deficits, no plan. Yes, it's time to #HitTheRoadBarack,' wrote another.

Still, some readers thought the cover was just another attempt at stirring the pot - in the POTUS's favor.

'#HitTheRoadBarack Not to burst anyone's bubble,' one reader wrote, 'but Newsweek might be trying the old reverse psychology. Trash Barry, to energize his base.'

After all, it was not so long ago that the same magazine proclaimed Mitt Romney was 'too insecure' to be president.

The now iconic image that graces this cover of Newsweek was taken by Associated Press photographer Carolyn Kaster.  

Taken
 on August 12, the image is one in a series of nine of the President 
walking on a lush green street with secret service trailing him close 
behind.

He seems at ease, happy, as if he is surrounded by good friends.

The
 captain reads: 'President Barack Obama speaks to media as he walks 
through his Hyde Park neighborhood to a campaign event, Sunday, Aug. 12,
 2012, in Chicago.'

This disarmed appearance is critical to the cover image, which almost comes off as a sneak attack on the POTUS. At least they had the dignity to remove the gum he was chewing.

The
 divorce between the president's light demeanor and the damning text 
makes the cover - and the image - all the more interesting.

Some
 might recognize Mrs Kaster as the same photographer who snapped the 
image of Barack Obama in Iowa's Bayliss Park last week.

Speaking from a podium, he gestured his hands in such a way that he seems to be grasping the sun, or rather, a crystal ball.
