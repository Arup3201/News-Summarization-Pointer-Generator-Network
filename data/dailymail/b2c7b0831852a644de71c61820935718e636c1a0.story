A 3-year-old Florida boy is dead after enduring horrific torture including having been burned, beaten and thrown across a room - and, according to authorities, the boy's 21-year-old mother is to blame.

Ghanson Debrosse was rushed to the Jackson North Medical Center about 3:30 am on Tuesday after his mother, Fafane Caze, called 9-1-1 to report that he wasn't breathing.

At the hospital, doctors determined that the 3-year-old boy had been dead for several hours.

Tragedy: Authorities say 3-year-old Ghanson Debrosse was tortured to death by his own mother

Fafane Caze is accused of torturing her 3-year-old son to death by beating, throwing and burning him with a cigarette lighter

Caze told investigators that the boy recently had been in Haiti visiting relatives. When she picked him up from the airport, she initially claimed, he showed signs of abuse.

After 12 hours of questioning, Caze admitted to beating and torturing the boy.

'She didn’t shed a tear,' Neal Cuevas, a major with the Miami Police Department, told the Miami Herald. 'She cared more about getting arrested than she did about her son.'

According to her arrest report, Caze 'used a lighter to burn the victim's genital area, in an attempt to stop the victim from urinating on the floor.'

On Wednesday, Detective Alonzo Rhymer testified that the boy also had burns on his face and fingers, as well as buckle-shaped scars all over his body. The imprint left by the buckle, he said, was a match for the buckle Caze wore as part of her uniform for her job as a security guard, which left multiple scars and open wounds. 

'Some were fresh, some were old,' Rhymer testified.

Detectives also say that Caze beat the boy with a broom handle when he defecated on himself. The broom handle was found broken in Caze's home. 

Caze admitted to authorities that she threw the boy across a room and into a table. Afterwards, the toddler gasped for air and asked for water as he struggled to breathe. 

It was only after the boy had stopped breathing completely that Caze called 9-1-1.

In his report, a North Miami detective wrote that in the past Caze had 'refused to seek medical attention to treat the victim's injuries, 
instead concocting a remedy of vegetable oil and laundry blue to treat 
the victim's wounds.'

On Tuesday, Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Esther Jacobo told reporters about three prior reports made to the agency about Caze's family, each of which was in 2010.

In one case, Caze was holding baby Ghanson as she had a physical altercation with his father, Donald Debrosse. According to the DCF report, Caze attempted to throw the then-infant at Debrosse.

Tortured: 3-year-old Ghanson would be burned and beaten as punishment for wetting himself

For now, Fafane has been charged with aggravated child abuse and 
torture. The judge in the case added the charge of attempted felony murder to the list, which kept her remanded without bail as a murder charge is pending depending on the results of a report from the medical examiner.

'If anybody deserves the additional charge she deserves
 it,' Cuevas said. 'She doesn’t deserve her 
freedom. She doesn’t deserve being around her children and she 
definitely doesn’t deserve to be around anyone else’s children.'

Caze has two other children - ages 1 and 4 - who were placed in foster care following their mother's arrest after no friends or members of Caze's family stepped forward to take them in.
