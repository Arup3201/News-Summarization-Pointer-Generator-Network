A 31-year old middle school teacher turned herself into authorities on Wednesday after getting caught last month sexting a 14-year-old student.

Ashley Casiday, a married mother of two, taught 8th grade English at Leeds Middle School for a year and a half before the shocking revelation prompted her resignation.

The investigation into Casiday's misconduct started last month when the teen's father alerted the school's principal to the obscene texts.

Casiday voluntarily turned herself into the St Clair County Jail where she was booked Wednesday and charged with transmitting obscene material to a child.

She was released after posting $100,000 bond. 

'It's unfortunate that one bad apple can ruin the whole barrel,' St Clair County District Attorney Richard Minor told AL.com.  'Ninety-nine percent are honest, hardworking teachers that really care for the kids in our school systems, but we're marked by and people remember the one's like this because of the crime they committed. '

Minor says it happens in every profession, despite much coverage of abuse in the education field.

'It shouldn't cause a black eye to any school system,' Minor said.

'I would add that parents should use this as a reminder to get involved in their child's electronic life,' he added.
