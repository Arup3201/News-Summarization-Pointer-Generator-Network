European migrants living in Scotland, including thousands of Germans, could hold the key to breaking up Britain.

Polls suggest the referendum on Scottish independence is on a knife-edge – meaning the views of many of the 120,000 non-Scots EU citizens who live north of the border could play a pivotal role.

Poles are the biggest group of foreigners on the electoral roll, and there are about 13,000 German citizens eligible to vote.

Coming out for independence: German nationals Daniel Mittler (left) and Stefan Buettner, who live in Scotland

Experts believe many of them may choose to back Scottish independence because of Westminster’s perceived hostility to the European Union.

Among the Germans backing the ‘Yes’ campaign is Bavarian Stefan Buettner, who lives in Edinburgh. Mr Buettner, an energy adviser, said: ‘I feel Scotland is more pro-European than the rest of the UK.

‘I want the Yes side to win. The Germans and the Scots are very much compatible and there are a lot of cultural similarities.

‘We are equally tight with money, we love a bargain and share a similarly dry sense of humour.’

Left-leaning German-Scot Daniel Mittler feels a vote for independence would help to shift the political direction of Europe.

The Edinburgh university graduate and environmental activist said: ‘I say “Ja” to an independent Scotland, to chart a different course than the suicidal, City-dependent and fossil-fuelled trajectory that the London-dominated UK is on.

Latest census figures show 120,824 EU citizens (excluding English, Welsh, Irish and Northern Irish) are eligible to vote in the referendum on the grounds that they currently live in Scotland and are aged 16 or over.

The Electoral Commission said in December that 80,000 of those who were eligible had actually registered to vote.

On this basis it is estimated that there are:

(Plus smaller groups from 19 other EU countries)

‘Scottish self-rule has the potential to be a building block for a Europe of the regions.’

Fear of a Conservative and Ukip coalition has led St Andrews-based massage therapist Camilla Hey, who grew up near Dusseldorf, to change her view on Scotland’s future.

She said: ‘The idea of a Conservative and Ukip coalition freaks me out. The Scottish are very clear that they want to stay in the EU and so do I. If we vote No and remain tied to England, and then vote to quit the EU, we will go back to Germany.’ Edinburgh-based linguistic researcher Margarete Tan remains undecided, but acknowledges she sees a number of advantages in creating a new Scottish state.

The Bavaria-born mother of three said: ‘I do, very much, see arguments in favour of Scottish independence. Creating a new country from scratch gives you the opportunity to establish proportional representation in the electoral system.’

Professor Sir Tom Devine, the eminent Scottish political historian who is in favour of independence, said: ‘EU migrants could absolutely have an impact on the vote. They could be the X-factor in the decision.’

Dr Diego Palacios Cerezales, a politics lecturer at Stirling University, said: ‘The question of whether to vote Yes or No is being decided on many different levels for European citizens.

‘They see that Scotland is more pro-European than the rest of the country. There is the chance of a referendum as early as next year on Britain’s membership of the EU, which could see the UK leave.

‘That may turn many towards the Yes camp in this vote.’

The organisation Germans For Scottish Independence has more than 1,000 followers on Facebook.

Supporter Vince Diaz stated: ‘We are terrified that lot downstairs [will] take Scotland out of Europe if No wins. We’d have to leave or beg for a foreign subject permanent visa. Independence is the only solution.’

Ania Lewandowska, of the group Polish For Yes, said: ‘We are worried about Westminster’s increasingly Right-wing agenda and the rise of Ukip.’ However, last month, a survey of 245 Scots-based Poles suggested that two thirds were intending to vote No.

Andrew Kocaj, 27, managing director of the Polish Family Support Centre in Edinburgh said: ‘I’m quite happy with the way things are.’

German-born Dr Anselm Heinrich, a lecturer in theatre studies at Glasgow University, moved to Scotland in 2006. He said: ‘I have already voted No by post. While I love the spirit of “we’re going to make this happen” I think it’s based on a very romantic notion which, in practice, is not feasible.’

Council employee Ildiko Mair, from Aberdeen, moved from Hungary 23 years ago. She said: ‘The Hungarian community here all want the same – that is to say no thanks.

‘I have no idea why someone wakes up one morning and after 300 years of unity decides to try and fix what is not broken.’
