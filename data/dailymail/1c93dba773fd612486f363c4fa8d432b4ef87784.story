It was a good night for Premier League misfits at the NRGi Park as Denmark beat the USA thanks to a Nicklas Bendtner hat-trick after Jozy Altidore had opened the scoring for the visitors.

On an evening when Tottenham's Christian Eriksen became the youngest Dane to win 50 international caps, Altidore, who could only muster a single goal in the English top flight during an 18-month spell at Sunderland, put the USA ahead after 19 minutes in Aarhus.

But the Danes were soon level through former Arsenal forward Bendtner. Aron Johannsson restored Jurgen Klinsmann's side's lead before Bendtner scored twice in the final seven minutes to seal his hat-trick and earn victory for Morten Olsen's side.

Denmark started the international friendly on the front foot but found themselves a goal behind when Altidore, who joined Toronto in January as part of the deal that saw Jermain Defoe return to England, stroked home Timmy Chandler's cross.

The goal failed to alter the pattern of the game and the home side were level on 33 minutes. The Wolfsburg forward found himself in acres of space in the six yard box after the US defence failed to deal with Lasse Vibe's pass before Bendtner swept home.

Johannsson gave the away side the lead - once more against the run of play - after 66 minutes when the AZ forward pounced in the box after Altidore's unselfish pass.  

As Denmark looked to be heading towards a home defeat Bedntner was on hand to grab his second to draw the hosts level for a second time in the 84th minute.

And the game was won in injury time with the pick of the five goals. Eriksen played played a diagonal pass though to Bendtner who, with one touch brought the ball under control, before firing the ball into the bottom corner.
