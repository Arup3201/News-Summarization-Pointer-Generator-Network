Tribunal: Stella English, the winner of the Apprentice 2010, is claiming constructive dismissal against her former mentor, Lord Sugar (pictured leaving the hearing)

When she won The Apprentice, Stella English expected Lord Sugar to make her work hard for her £100,000 salary.

Instead, she ended up as an ‘ostracised’  and ‘overpaid lackey’, she told a tribunal.

Miss English, who is suing Lord Sugar for constructive dismissal, said she felt nothing like his ‘apprentice’ because she saw him only five times in her 13 months with his company.

When he told her he wasn’t renewing her contract, he said he had only moved her to another post to avoid embarrassment for him if she resigned, before adding: ‘But the fact is that I don’t give a s***.’

In 2010, Miss English, 34, joined the sixth series of the BBC1 show with 15 other contestants, and in September began a three-month trial with Viglen as part of the selection process, a post that she continued in after winning the show in December.

Describing her first day at the firm which supplies IT equipment to academy schools, she said: ‘No specific duties were allocated to me. I was provided with a desk and a phone but that was pretty much it.’

Miss English, a mother of two from Whitstable, Kent, told the tribunal in East London which Lord Sugar, 65, attended, that the job was a ‘sham’ because the post had previously been filled by a woman on a salary of £35,000.

‘My reasons for going on to The Apprentice was to be an apprentice and to be mentored by Lord Sugar,’ said Miss English, who earned £82,500 a year as the only female trading manager at Japanese investment bank Daiwa before going on the show.

‘I didn’t believe that they would pay me £100,000 a year to do anything less than £100,000 worth of work.

‘The career-enhancing opportunities that The Apprentice position had been sold as simply failed to materialise.’

Claim: Ms English (pictured with Lord Sugar) told the hearing: 'The career-enhancing opportunities that The Apprentice position had been sold as simply failed to materialise'

She said she emailed her boss, Bordan
 Tkachuk, after discovering the company had made an annual profit of 
£800,000 despite a £60million turnover and noticing that projects worth 
£1.4million had not been invoiced.

Miss English cried as she told the 
tribunal that his reply – which was copied to all her colleagues – said:
 ‘I don’t know what you’re doing but this ain’t how things work around 
here.’

Miss English then emailed Lord Sugar and asked to discuss the problem. When she arrived at their meeting, Mr Tkachuk was there.

She said that she was upset when Lord
 Sugar asked him what he thought of her and Mr Tkachuk replied: ‘Nice 
girl. Don’t do a lot.’ Miss English said: ‘They had never said this to 
me.’

She ‘continued to be marginalised’ 
and in May 2011 told Lord Sugar in a phone call: ‘I have tried so hard 
for so long and it’s not working. I’m an overpaid lackey at Viglen.’

She told the tribunal: ‘My pride 
would not allow me to continue doing it.’ In June 2011, Miss English 
began a job at Lord Sugar’s internet set-top box consortium YouView.

Last weekend, it was announced that Lord Sugar had left YouView after a boardroom argument.

Miss English claimed she had similar 
problems at YouView and was called to a meeting on September 28, 2011, 
where Lord Sugar told her he was not renewing her contract.

Turned sour: Ms English said her role with Viglen made her an 'overpaid lackey' and she has accused Lord Sugar of forcing her out

She said he told her he had only 
offered her the YouView role because he was worried about ‘adverse 
publicity’ for The Apprentice, the BBC or his own image if she resigned.

He added: ‘But the fact is that I don’t give a s***.’

Miss English said: ‘I could not 
believe what he was saying. I was in absolute shock. I’d given two years
 of my life to be told by somebody that “I don’t give a s***”. All the 
effort that I’d put in – to be told this was so unnecessary.’

Under cross-examination from Seamus 
Sweeney, representing Lord Sugar, Miss English said she did not remember
 being told that The Apprentice winner might not work directly with Lord
 Sugar.

In 2011, The Apprentice’s prize was changed to a £250,000 investment to help the winner start a company.

Victory: Stella beat rival Chris Bates in the 2010 final of the show but she said the job was not what she hoped

Winner: Stella English, pictured on her first day, was a young woman with no qualifications who rose to a highly-paid role as a management boss before winning the BBC show three years ago

The tribunal heard filming of the TV 
series took place from September to November 2009, with Ms English going
 away as a semi-finalist along with Chris Bates.

It was not televised until the following autumn, while her probationary period with Viglen took place from September 2010 to December of that year, before the final episode of the programme was filmed and she was crowned the winner.

During cross-examination from Seamus Sweeney, representing Lord Sugar, Ms English admitted she had been given a 'talk of doom' by the series producers, as had all the other entrants.

In it, they were warned of the potential media publicity they would get from taking part and that it was not advisable for them to leave their current jobs entirely in case they did not win.

Ms English said her employers had given her a sabbatical while filming took place, but she quit the company to go and work at Viglen.

She said she did not remember being told that the winner might not work directly with Lord Sugar, adding that she understood they had in previous series.

'I didn't believe that they would pay me £100,000 a year to do anything less than £100,000 worth of work,' she said.

'My reasons for going on to The Apprentice was to be an apprentice and to be mentored by Lord Sugar.'

But she admitted: 'I had my own interpretation of what the job was going to be. Nobody had ever said "this is what it's going to be".'

Earlier, Lord Sugar sniggered as the 
tribunal was played clips of the TV show, in which he is described as 
'Britain's most belligerent boss'.

Ms English said that on her first day at Viglen Mr Tkachuk looked at her with 'contempt' and told her: 'There is no job.'

She said she often witnessed him displaying an 'aggressive manner'.

But she said she did not say anything to Lord Sugar as she 'didn't want to be a troublemaker'.

The tribunal was adjourned until today.
