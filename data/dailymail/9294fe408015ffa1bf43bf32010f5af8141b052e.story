Mesut Ozil is set to miss up to six weeks with the hamstring injury he sustained in Arsenal’s Champions League exit against Bayern Munich.

The German underwent further medical assessment at the Gunners’ training ground on Wednesday and has been diagnosed with a grade two hamstring strain.

Sportsmail understands that Ozil is expected to be sidelined for between four and six weeks, ruling him of Arsenal’s league fixtures over the next month against Tottenham, Chelsea, Swansea City, Manchester City and Everton.

Benched: Mesut Ozil was substituted at half-time against Bayern Munich in the Champions League clash

Out of sorts: Ozil was underwhelming in the first half at the Allianz Arena

Arsene Wenger predicted on Tuesday night that the playmaker would be out for 'at least a few weeks' and said he would know more after further tests on Wednesday.

With the manager's fears now realised, Arsenal's record signing faces an uphill battle to be fit for the club's FA Cup semi-final clash with Wigan Athletic on April 12 as they attempt to end their nine-year trophy drought.

The worst-case scenario is that he will also miss the April league matches against Hull City and Newcastle United, and will not return until early May.

Ozil is believed to have injured his hamstring in the opening 10 minutes of the second-leg, last-16 clash at the Allianz Arena but carried on playing until half-time and aggravated the problem.

He was checked by Arsenal’s medical team during the break and also saw Bayern’s Germany team doctor Hans Muller Wohlfahrt.

Game on: But Lukas Podolski's equaliser had little bearing on the overall result

Speaking about Ozil in the immediate after of the Gunners’ Champions League exit, Wenger said: 'He has a hamstring injury that looks quite serious. I don’t know how long he will be out. For sure, he is out of Spurs.

'We have to make a scan tomorrow (Wednesday) to see how bad it is but he is out at least for a few weeks. I hope it’s not too bad.'

Blow: Arsene Wenger could be without Ozil for six weeks

Ozil's setback is the latest in a series of serious injuries to senior members of Wenger's squad.

Jack Wilshere will miss around two months with a foot injury sustained on international duty last week and Theo Walcott is out until next season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

Aaron Ramsey is still not fully fit after being sidelined since December 26 with a thigh injury.
