First there was Planking, then there was the Selfie Olympics, and now there is the newest meme called Whaling in which teens document themselves flipping like a whale leaping out from the sea.

The latest online phenomenon of participants leaping back like a whale from behind various objects can be found on Vine under the hashtag #Whaling.

Vine offers a definition for Whaling which is, 'to dive backwards with one's body in a public or unusual place, like a whale breaching the surface of the ocean.'

Of course when there's no ocean to jump from, whalers jump out from behind toilet stalls, couches, and beds.

Other more adventurous Whalers perform the stunt at fast food restaurants, grocery stores, diners, and even offices.

Other trends like planking in which one takes photos of themselves in a yoga plank pose all over the city or the Selfie Olympics in which teens compete to create the most dangerous selfie may sink when compared to this latest online trend.
