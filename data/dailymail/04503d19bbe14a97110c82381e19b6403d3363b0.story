Warren Buffett has tried calming the fears of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders since the firm failed to beat the market last year.

The 'Oracle of Omaha' told investors that they should be confident in the company's prospects.

Buffett released an upbeat annual letter Saturday. He told investors in the Omaha, Nebraska, based conglomerate that just about everything turned out well for Berkshire's 80-odd subsidiaries last year.

And Buffett says the company has a solid foundation that now includes owning 8 1/2 businesses big enough to be part of the Fortune 500 if they were separate companies.

The latest addition to that list was the ketchup-maker Heinz, which Berkshire bought half of last year.

Buffett says that deal will start paying off in 2014 after one-time charges of $1.3billion related to restructuring and the purchase itself limited Heinz's profits last year.

He continued his optimism through the weekend, as the he said in the annual letter he writes to Berkshire Hathaway's vice chairman Charlie Munger was released and details their plans for growth.

'Charlie and I have always considered a 'bet' on ever-rising U.S. prosperity to be a very close to a sure thing,' Buffett, 83, said in his annual letter, referring to his 90-year-old vice chairman Charlie Munger.

'America's best days lie ahead.'

Full-year profit rose 31 per cent to $19.48billion, or $11,850 per Class A share, while operating profit rose 20 per cent to $15.14billion, or $9,211 per share.

For the fourth quarter, net profit 
rose nearly 10 per cent to $4.99billion, or $3,035 per share, and 
operating profit rose 34 per cent to $3.78billion, or $2,297 per share.

Results
 improved in many of the Omaha, Nebraska-based company's more than 80 
businesses, from retail to railroads, insurance to ice cream.

'On the operating front, just about everything turned out well for us last year - in certain cases very well,' the world's fourth-richest man wrote to shareholders.

Buffett said he remains on the hunt for more big acquisitions, which he calls 'elephants,' after two recent big purchases: a $5.6 billion acquisition of Nevada utility NV Energy by Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy unit, and the $12.25billion investment in Heinz.

Buffett has long recommended diversified investments in basic businesses capable of steadily boosting revenue over the long haul.

While Berkshire is known for its insurance businesses, Buffett said profit from a 'Powerhouse Five' of large non-insurance unit - the BNSF railway, Iscar for metalworking, Lubrizol for chemicals, Marmon for industrial products, and MidAmerican - might boost pre-tax profit in 2014 by $1billion from the $10.8billion they collected in 2013.

Book value per share at the end of 2013 rose 18.2 per cent from the end of 2012, to reach $134,973.
