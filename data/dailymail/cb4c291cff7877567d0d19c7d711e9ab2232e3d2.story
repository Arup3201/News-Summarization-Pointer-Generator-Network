The President to Israel has revealed how he used to hide his identity when travelling incognito in the 1970s - a fake moustache and a hat.

Shimon Peres had to disguise himself to attend peace talks between Israel and Jordan’s King Hussein in the mid-seventies.

The 90-year-old leader, then the minister of defence, also wore glasses and a fake full beard to travel to the secret talks without being discovered.

President Peres posted this picture with the caption: 'This is the disguise I wore in the mid-seventies when I would go to my meetings with King Hussein. Happy #Purim!', featuring two other disguises he used below it

President Peres posted the image on social media, showing himself in the basic, but clearly effective, disguises which helped him travel to Jordan to advocate peace between the two nations.

The post went up on Twitter and Facebook ahead of the Jewish holiday Purim, a celebration which include dressing up in costumes.

President Peres also encouraged his Facebook followers to send in their Purim fancy dress, saying ‘I am sure they are much better than mine’.

President Peres, born Szymon Perski in Vishnyeva, at the time part of Poland, but now located in Belarus. He immigrated to Israel, then Palestine, in 1934.

He was first elected to the Knesset in November 1959, and apart from a short three-month hiatus from politics in 2006, he served continuously until 2007.

In his 48 years in the Knesset, he served as Prime Minister twice as well as Interim Prime Minister twice. He 'left' in 2007 when he became President.

Earlier today, as the nation prepares to celebrate Purim on Saturday night, the military reported Gaza militants fired a rocket at Israel after two days of intense exchanges.

The Israeli army says the rocket exploded in southern Israel on Friday morning but caused no damage or injuries.

According to military officials, Gaza militants have fired 70 rockets at Israel since Wednesday. That figure included 18, which were fired after the Islamic Jihad announced on Thursday it would observe a cease-fire.
