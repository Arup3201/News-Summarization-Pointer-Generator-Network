A TV newsreader was subjected to vile racist and sexist abuse after she decided not to wear a poppy during a  bulletin on Armistice Day.

Charlene White began receiving offensive Twitter messages hours after the ITV news programme was screened on Monday.

The tweets from internet trolls labelled her a ‘black ****’ and a ‘fat ****’ – and some even told the London-born journalist, whose Jamaican father served in the RAF, to ‘go back to where you came from’.

Abuse: Charlene White received racist and sexist messages for not wearing a poppy on ITV News London

One posted: ‘You don’t deserve to sit in front of the British public. Talk about disrespect! Disgraceful.’

The abusive messages came to light yesterday after Miss White, 35, wrote a response on the ITV website.

The presenter, who is the patron of several charities, including Bowel Cancer UK, said she didn’t want to be seen to favour the Royal British Legion over others, so avoided wearing a poppy while on screen.

Miss White, who joined ITN in 2008 and reads the ITV London News and occasional national bulletins, said: ‘In the last few days I’ve been subjected to a torrent of racist and sexist abuse as a result of me choosing not to wear a poppy on screen, while presenting for ITV News.

‘It was a decision I made a number of
years ago, but the backlash this year has been far bigger and more 
widespread than in previous years.

‘I support, and am a patron of, a 
number of charities and I am uncomfortable with giving one of those 
charities more on-screen time than others. I prefer to be neutral and 
impartial on screen so that one of those charities doesn’t feel less 
favoured than another.

‘Off screen in my private life, it’s different. I wear a red ribbon at the start of December for World Aids Day, a pink ribbon in October during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a badge in April during Bowel Cancer Awareness Month and – yes – a poppy on Armistice Day.’

Symbolic: But Ms White said that no one should be forced to wear a poppy in November

Miss White joins other high-profile newsreaders to take the decision not to wear a poppy on screen, including Channel 4 presenter Jon Snow, who has denounced ‘poppy fascism’.

Last night, a spokesman for the Royal British Legion echoed his views, adding: ‘We take the view that the poppy represents sacrifices made in the defence of freedom, so the decision to wear it must be a matter of personal choice. If the poppy became compulsory it would lose its meaning and significance.’

A spokesman for ITV News said: ‘A majority of our journalists choose to wear a poppy. We take the view that it is up to each individual to decide if they wish to wear a poppy or not.

‘We don’t impose a requirement on our team to wear poppies for the programme as a matter of course, nor do we object if they choose to.’
