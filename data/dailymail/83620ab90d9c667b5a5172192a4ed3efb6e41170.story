Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling has praised Brendan Rodgers for helping him become a better player during his time at Anfield.

The 19-year-old has quickly become an integral part of Rodgers' first-team and played a key role as the Reds narrowly missed out on the Premier League title last season.

And Sterling, who is currently training with England ahead of Saturday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia, believes his manager has been a major factor in his development.

Asked about Rodgers in an interview with LFC Xtra, Sterling said: 'He has taught me to play in numerous different positions and adapt to different positions, being able to work and be effective in each of them.

'The best piece of advice I've been given is to live, eat and sleep football. It was great advice given to me by the manager, and it has helped me going forward.'

Sterling is yet to win silverware with Liverpool or England but he has his sights firmly set on success for club and country over the next five years.

He added: 'Hopefully winning trophies with Liverpool, doing well for England and trying to be at the peak of my game at that time.'
