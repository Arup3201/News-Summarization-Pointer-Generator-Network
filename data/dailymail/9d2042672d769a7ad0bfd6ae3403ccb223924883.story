A modern day gold rush is taking place along the coast of a Russian town after a storm washed a small fortune in amber onto the beach.

Amber is fossilized tree resin valued enormously for its colour and natural beauty since Neolithic times. It is treated as a gemstone and used in jewellery, but is also used as an ingredient in perfumes, and in traditional medicine.

Although it can be found all over the world more than 90 percent of the world’s amber is found along the Samland coast in the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast region, sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania.

Dozens of people dived into the sea near the Russian town of Pionersky in Kaliningrad to search for amber

The resin was washed ashore during a storm in the Baltic which is home to 90 percent of the world's supply

Locals waded into the ocean with nets to scoop up any pieces of amber that have been washed up 

Pieces of amber torn from the seafloor are cast up by the waves, and collected by hand, dredging, or diving. The latest storm creating a huge crop of amber for locals who turned up with nets and diving suits to line their pockets with the gemstone from the shoreline in the town of Pionersky, in the Kaliningrad region.

Most of them seemed not to be put off by the freezing cold conditions, some even putting on wetsuits and using huge nets to sweep the shoreline as waves washed over them.

Others stayed onshore picking through blackened seaweed and rock pools.

Local Olga Bazhenova, 42, interviewed on Russian TV said: 'Town residents and tourists were picking up small and medium-sized pieces of amber from seaweed and sand from dawn till dusk. It was a free for all, some people make themselves a lot of money to start the New Year.'

She added: 'Even pensioners forgot their ailments and age and scratched the frozen soil with sticks like babies in a sandpit.'

The timing could not have been better, as the 'free gift from nature' will help people out during the country’s current economic crisis, but also raise spirits in the region.

The amber is a major source of income for the region with the local Kaliningrad Amber Factory extracting 250 tonnes of it in 2014.

Amber comes from resin which oozed from ancient trees and formed into larger lumps which fossilised and hardened. 

In some cases the resin formed around an ancient insect, preserving it perfectly for millions of years. 

The resin is different to the sap found within a tree which acts as its vascular system. 

It is believed that most amber is between 30 and 90 million years old.

Amber is most commonly used as a jewellery, but it is also used in perfumes. The substance has even been used as a building material in several 17th century churches. 

Some faith 'healers' believe that the fossil has certain restorative properties.

Some scientists believe that it would be possible to extract DNA from creatures set in amber, possibly finding additional answers for questions about evolution. 

According to the Birmingham Assay Office, amber is very soft and warm to the touch and is easily scratched. 

It will melt if touched with a hot needle. 

Also, if you put alcohol on amber it should evaporate without leaving any sticky residue. 

The fossil also produces static electricity if it is rubbed with a soft cloth and will float in a strong saltwater solution. 

If you lick amber, it should not have any taste - unlike the plastic versions.   

Some of the more adventurous came equipped with snorkels and face masks to dive on the amber 

Less intrepid people picked their way through the sand looking for any smaller bits of amber on the beach

Some larger pieces of amber were found in mud near the waterline by locals
