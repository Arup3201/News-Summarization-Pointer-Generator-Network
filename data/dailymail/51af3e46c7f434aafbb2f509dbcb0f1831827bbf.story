Much discussed and a source of endless gossip, The Archers Christmas pantomime has always been a highlight of the Ambridge calendar.

So, when this year’s production was cancelled due to poor attendance at auditions, it left loyal listeners aghast.

However, rather than admit defeat, the fictional village’s director, Lynda Snell, has rallied her cast to put on a production of Noel Coward’s play Blithe Spirit.

The 90-minute show, broadcast on Boxing Day, will fit into the series as a whole, with episodes before and after seamlessly running into and out of the play.

However, Jeremy Howe, Radio 4’s commissioning editor for drama, said the production can also stand alone in its own right.

He commented: ‘It will be a straight production of one of the great comedies of the English stage’.

This is the first time there has been such a change in the programme’s format in its nearly 64-year history.

Mr Howe added: ‘The whole thing is very nicely dovetailed together. You have an Archers Christmas episode and then the Boxing Day episode is Blithe Spirit - it’s integrated into the programme, but Blithe Spirit should also stand alone as a rollicking good production.

‘Every year Lynda Snell puts on a pantomime and every year we never go to the pantomime - which is probably a good thing, I think - but we hear all the backstage gossip. 

'She is the most tyrant producer in the history of tyrant producers, which is entertaining in itself - and all the stories around that is all good comedy for the Archers.

‘But this year the panto collapsed and she is putting on her own production of Blithe Spirit, with the cast of the Archers.

‘There’s a word of warning here that all the backstage shenanigans are as entertaining as ever but it will actually be a very good production of Blithe Spirit’.

Blithe Spirit, which recently saw a West End production led by Angela Lansbury, tells the story of socialite and novelist Charles Condomine, who conducts a séance in his house, hoping to gather material for his next book. However, the scheme backfires when he is haunted by the ghost of his first wife.

The parts will be played by the normal actors of The Archers, who will also remain as their Ambridge characters during this play within a play.

On top of the long-running programme’s usual cast, actor Julian Ryan Tutt, most famous for sitcom Green Wing will be playing a role.

However, Mr Howe would not comment on why the actor had been called in or whether he will be playing a larger role in The Archers.
