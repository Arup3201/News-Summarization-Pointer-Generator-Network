Emily Nickless and Leigh-Anne Wharton are happy to be home again after the floods in West Wales

A teenager and her friend were winched to safety from a flooded campsite after her grandfather saw his caravan on TV under 6ft of water.

Emily Nickless, 18, and her friend Leigh-Anne Wharton, 17, were asleep inside when fast flowing water threatened to sweep the static caravan away.

Emily’s grandfather Sam Nickless had lent the pair his caravan which was pitched at the Riverside Caravan Park in Llandre, near Aberystwyth, Wales.

Mr Nickless, 65, was watching the news 70 miles away in Telford, Shropshire, which showed shocking pictures of holidaymakers trapped by the floods.

Incredibly, he even saw his own caravan being swamped by the water after the nearby River Eleri burst its banks in the early hours of Saturday.

He phoned Emily at 5am to see if she had left the caravan but she was still fast sleep inside asleep.

After numerous phone calls he finally managed to rouse the girls they opened the door to find they were stranded by the rising water.

Emily and Leigh-Anne, from Telford, managed to call for help and lifeboat crews called an RAF helicopter crew who winched them to safety.

Today, Emily, who is study her A-Levels, said: 'I got woken up by a call on my mobile on Saturday.

'When I answered the phone it was my grandad, he told me to look out the window because the campsite was on the news because it was under water.

'He told me we should try and get out of the caravan because it looked like it was under 6ft of water.

'When we opened the door, it was terrible. It was impossible to get out.

'We
saw people on the cliff and we kept the door open because the water was
still rising and if we closed it - we wouldn’t have been able to open 
it again.

'We saw there were rescue people in a boat probably about 700 metres away from us.

'We were jumping up and down quite a bit and one guy looked over and saw us. He told us to stay there.'

An RAF helicopter was alerted to the stranded girls and they were winched to safety.

Emily added: 'The guy came down and was about two metres away from us.

'He stepped forward and fell straight into the water.

'But he waded over to us and put the harnesses around us.'

More than 1,000 people, including 40 holidaymakers were forced to flee the violent floods.

Campsite owner Stephen South said: 'Between 2am and 4am, it was about three-and-a-half to four foot deep.

'We managed to get most people out. Everybody was trying to muck in together and get people out. It was frightening.

'Excluding the caravans, we could have got £300,000 to £400,000 worth of damage, but that is just a guess. It is just devastating.'
