Migrating geese are able to fly to extraordinary high altitudes because they take a ‘rollercoaster’ route, scientists have found.

Scientists have long been puzzled how geese fly to 24,000 feet (7,300m) or more as they cross the Himalayas.

Now British researchers, tracking a flock of bar-headed geese from Mongolia to India, have found that the birds drop altitude before soaring to new heights.

The scientists, from the universities of Bangor, Exeter and Birmingham, compared the method to the path of a rollercoaster.

In order to preserve energy, the geese avoid having to flap harder and harder in very thin air.

Instead, the birds track the underlying terrain - even if this means repeatedly shedding hard-won altitude - only to have to regain height later in the same or subsequent flight.

As the decreasing air density reduces the bird’s ability to produce the lift and thrust required to maintain flight, they drop down to find more dense air to give them a lift.

The scientists, whose work is published in the journal Science, used altitude trackers and heart rate monitors to track the geese.

The bar-headed goose has shown how it manages to cruise at extreme altitudes as it soars above the Himalayas.

It literally puts its heart into the challenge of breathing air consisting of just seven per cent oxygen, scientists found.

Available oxygen is channelled to the bird’s heart, which beats fast to pump oxygenated blood to the rest of its body.

In this way, the bar-headed goose is able to cross the Himalayan mountain range on its migratory flights between India and China, reaching heights of almost 24,000 feet (7,300 metres).

Most people exposed to such conditions would quickly pass out, and may even die.

Scientists believe lessons learned from the bar-headed goose could help prevent heart attacks and strokes in humans.

Lead researcher Dr Lucy Hawkes, from the centre for ecology and conservation at the University of Exeter, said: 'It all seems to come down to how much oxygen bar-headed geese can supply to their heart muscles.

'The more they can supply, the faster they can beat their hearts and keep the supply of oxygen to the rest of the body going.

'This suggests that other species, including humans, are limited more by what our hearts can do than by how fit the rest of our muscles are at altitude.' 

Robin Spivey of Bangor University said: ‘As even horizontal flapping flight is relatively expensive at higher altitudes, it is generally more efficient to reduce the overall costs of flying by seeking higher-density air at lower altitudes.’

Professor Pat Butler from the University of Birmingham said the geese would seek out the side of valleys in order to swerve higher - in a way a roller coaster might swoop around a corner and upwards.

He said: ‘During these moments, it seems likely that the bar-headed geese are flying on the windward side of a valley wall.

‘This would give them the best opportunity to obtaining assistance from wind that is deflected upwards by the ground, providing additional rates of ascent with either a reduction in their energetic costs or at least no increase.’
