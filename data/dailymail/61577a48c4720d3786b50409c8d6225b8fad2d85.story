'Help me!' This is the comical moment a baby boy gets into a spin as he encounters twins for the first time.

A home video shot by an unidentified family in America, shows little Landon sat in-between his look-alike sisters on an armchair at home.

With his eyes wide open and head swinging  from side to side, he clearly doesn't know what to make of the mirror image before him.

At one point Landon throws a bewildered look directly at the camera, triggering laughter from those watching.

To date the clip of the confused infant has been watched more than 380,000 times.

'His facial expression is absolutely priceless!' one fan chimed after watching Landon in action.
