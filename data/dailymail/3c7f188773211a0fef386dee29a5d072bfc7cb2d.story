‘He tore the cover off the ball’ is said when a baseball player hits the ball hard – but a backup catcher literally did just that Friday night in Pittsburgh.

Milwaukee Brewers backstop Martin Maldonado secured his place in baseball lore when the cover came off an otherwise routine ground ball he hit during the sixth inning.

Maldonado had a runner on second base when his blistering ground ball caught Pirates third baseman Pedro Alvarez by surprise, and then everyone else in the stadium.

Anything but routine: Pirates third baseman Pedro Alvarez quickly looks at the unfurled ball before trying to thrw it to first base to record the out

The catcher was hustling towards first as the ball bounced towards third while the cover visibly unravelled before reaching Alvarez’s glove.

Alvarez looked surprised as he fielded it, but tried to throw Madonado out at first.

‘The ball just fell apart!’ Shouted surprised Brewers television play-by-play announcer Brian Anderson.

‘I have never seen that in my entire life,’ said Brewers radio announcer Bob Uecker – in his 41st baseball season as a player or broadcaster.

'I feel like I hit it on the barrel, not on the end of the bat,' Maldonado said after the game. 'But when I looked down, I see that something was spinning. I never thought it was the ball uncovered.

'I thought he threw it to second base. Then I looked back and saw the ball and I was like, ‘That’s kind of weird.’

‘That’s a new one for me,’ Uecker continued between chuckles. ‘[Alvarez] threw it anyway, and it rolled over there like a napkin.’

‘I’ve heard of hitting the cover off the ball, I’ve never seen it,’ Anderson continued, still in shock.

‘He literally hit the cover off the baseball,’ a Pirates announcer exclaimed. ‘just when you think you’ve seen it all… you will not see that again.’

Pirates first baseman Gaby Sanchez looked confused as the ball died about 20 feet before it reached and barely made it to his glove on a roll.

Sanchez then hands the ball to an amused umpire who gives it a quick inspection before tossing it away.

Pittsburgh catcher Russell Martin, in his ninth Major League season, didn’t know what to think when looking at the ball before handing it to bemused manager Clint Hurdle.

Announcers for both teams wondered aloud what the official scorer would rule the play – Maldonado was given a hit because he beat the throw to first base.

What looks like an ordinary single in the box score is anything but.

‘You could watch a hundred thousand more games and never see that,’ said the Pirates announcer.

The bizarre play led to a run later in the inning and helped power first place Brewers 5-3 past the third place pirates.
