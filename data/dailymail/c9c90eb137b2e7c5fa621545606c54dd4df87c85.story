This angry gorilla was clearly feeling camera shy.

The ape was filmed throwing a rock at a group of Irish tourists when they tried to take a video of him at Berlin Zoo. 

The animal can be seen walking through his open enclosure before suddenly hurling the rock - narrowly missing the group of men standing just feet away.

Stefan Nolan and his friends were waiting for their flight home and made a trip to the zoo to pass the time.

They filmed the 'impressive' animal on their phone as he walked down the slope towards them. 

One member of the group is then heard saying that 'gorillas are meant to be really aggressive' as they move to get a better view of the animal after he walked behind a bush.

As the men continue to talk among themselves, the animal picks up a rock from the ground and throws it towards the group. 

The animal is then seen standing on its hind legs - apparently judging whether he hit his target.

The camera jolts as Mr Nolan moves to avoid the missile - which was launched with such force that it is not caught on film.

Mr Nolan later uploaded the 23-second clip to YouTube, where it has now been viewed more than 40,000 times. 

Posting the video, he joked: 'Apparently gorillas aren't a fan of the Irish.' 

The animal that he filmed is one of five gorillas that is being kept at the zoo, where there is a large 'prairie' environment' for them to exercise in - and a separate indoor room for shelter. 

The Zoologischer Garten Berlin, received its first gorilla - a female called Fatou - in 1959. The animal, who gave birth to a baby in 1974, still lives there in a separate enclosure.
