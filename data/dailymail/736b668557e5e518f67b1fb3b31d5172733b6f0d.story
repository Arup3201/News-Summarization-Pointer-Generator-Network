The Duchess of Cambridge looked every inch the yummy mummy as she visited a London primary school today but had some competition in the style stakes in the shape of Turner Prize-winning artist Grayson Perry.

Resplendent in a £450 loose fitting navy dress by  Madderson London that showed a hint of baby bump, the Duchess was all smiles as she arrived at Barlby Primary School in West London.

Perry, meanwhile, wore a typically daring short black dress that he had designed himself and showed off a pair of legs that were almost as enviable as Kate's own.

The Duchess of Cambridge has really got her maternity style down.

Kate looked blooming gorgeous again today in a chic and sophisticated shift dress by upscale label Madderson London and while it does have a regular ready-to-wear line this brand is best known for its luxury maternity wear.

Launched in 2012 Madderson London uses prints, trims and embellishments as well as premium fabric enabling pregnant women be stylish even when they're expecting. And Kate isn't the only royal fan of the label's high end designs. Zara Phillips famously wore one of their dresses while she was pregnant with daughter Mia.

We love this 'Naomi' shift on the Duchess. The A-line cut skims her slender frame but is roomy enough to accommodate her baby bump. The navy wool is trimmed with feminine French tweed in pastel pink and the gold buttons add a dash of grown up glamour.

If you are expecting and are on the hunt for a smart day dress to see you through the next few months then click the link (right) to buy it now at Pinstripe and Pearls.

The duo were at the school to officially name a new art studio on behalf of art therapy charity, The Art Room, and the Duchess was given some art of her own to take home. 

As she chatted to Perry outside the school, a pair of pupils approached with a pint-sized printed chair in their hands, presumably made with Prince George in mind, and presented it to the Duchess.

A clearly delighted Kate, who was making her first public appearance since Christmas Day, then bent down to pick up the artwork and thank the children who made it. 

The Duchess, who is six months pregnant, showed a hint of baby bump beneath her £450 ‘Naomi’ shift dress, which is still available to buy although the company’s website has already crashed to unprecedented public interest.

Kate is not the first royal to have worn the brand while expecting  – Prince William’s cousin, Zara Phillips, also favoured it when pregnant with her daughter, Mia.

All parts of the dress are British made, including the fabric  from Yorkshire textile mill Hainsworth, who describe it as ‘doeskin’, which mimics the appearance and feel of the skin of a female deer.

By contrast, Perry said he had made his dress himself and declared the over-the-top black cocktail number with voluminous net underskirts to be his ‘ladies who lunch’ outfit.

‘I thought it was appropriate for the occasion,’ said the married father-of-one, who also wore black heels like the Duchess but with sheer, instead of opaque, tights. 

Although the duchess got top marks for style, her hair was much less easy to manipulate and whipped around her head on several occasions thanks to strong winds  

Hint of a bump: A tiny baby bump could be seen beneath the Duchess' dress. She is due to give birth to her second child in April

Busy week: The Duchess has a further engagement to complete this week and will complete another one on Monday

Speaking about the Duchess, he commented: 'If she goes somewhere the media will follow. 'It's up to her to use that to shine a laser beam upon the organisation with which she is working, it's her job. And she wields it with enormous grace as far as I can see.' 

The Turner prize-winning artist also described Kate, who has a series of royal engagements over the coming days, as 'looking pretty chic for six months'.

 The new Clore art studio, which the Duchess officially named today, will be run by The Art Room, a charity of which both the Duchess and Perry are patrons, which provides art therapy for underprivileged children.

85 children all aged between five and 11, will receive art sessions designed to provide them with self-confidence, self-esteem and independence in the new studio each week.

Inside the new art room the Duchess met with a group of eight children and asked them about their paintings. At one point one little boy said to her: ‘You would like to be a chicken’ to which she laughed and replied: ‘I would like to be a chicken? ‘Maybe, actually!’

She also took part in a round table discussion with charity founder Juli Beattie and fellow patron Grayson Perry. Speaking during the discussion, Perry said: ‘This is a normalised version of what I found out for myself, which is that an art practice is where you can go to soothe yourself.

‘A day like today makes everyone feel special that it's being taken seriously. Often people regard art as a kind of add-on. Certainly the recent education minister - mentioning no names Michael Gove - seemed to think art was this thing you could somehow elbow off the curriculum.

‘Yes, it's a huge part of Britain Plc and an essential part of life. We shouldn't think it's just something for posh people. That's why I identify so much with the Art Room because I come from that sort of background, a working class background.'

First outing: This is the first time the Duchess has been seen in public since attending church with the rest of the royals on Christmas Day

Delighted: The royal mother-to-be looked absolutely thrilled as the children presented her with the handmade gift

The room is named after the Clore Duffield Foundation which has been making donations to The Art Room since 2005 and will cover the running costs for the new space over the next three years.

The Duchess had planned to officially open the facility last autumn but was forced to cancel the engagement after developing hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness.

Although the space is now open, it was yet to be officially named - a function the Duchess completed during today's event, as well as speaking to staff and children who have benefited from The Art Room workshops already. 

As Kate left the school after her hour-long engagement she was greeted by 250 flag-waving children - each of whom had drawn a portrait of the the Duchess on the back. The royal looked delighted  and stopped to speak to several of the cheering youngsters before getting into her official car. 

Kensington Palace said the engagement reflects the Duchess’s interest in the arts and her keenness on the concept of using the creativity of art to enrich the lives of young people.

Supporter: Like the Duchess, the artist is a long-term supporter of The Art Room, a charity that provides art therapy to children

Big day: After being presented with a pint-sized chair, the Duchess went to speak with other pupils - some of whom looked a little bashful

A spokesman for the Art Room explained that there are many reasons why children are referred to their practitioners and why they need time away from their mainstream classrooms.

Some might be youngsters suffering bereavements, family breakdown or a chaotic home life, while others could be living with violence or abuse. Among them are also children on the autistic spectrum and others recently arrived in the UK.

According to the charity, children are encouraged to open up about anxieties as they paint in the hopes that they will ultimately learn to cope with the difficulties they face. Referrals can comes from teachers, parents and social workers or other adults involved in their lives.

Speaking ahead of the Duchess' arrival, one Year 5 child, who wishes to remain anonymous, said: 'I look forward to visiting The Art Room. It’s like having thinking space. Painting makes me feel good and I feel in a better mood afterwards.'

Head teacher Anthony Mannix added: ‘It is extremely exciting to be able to host HRH The Duchess of Cambridge as we can proudly introduce her to our children and show the school and our ethos.

‘Since opening The Art Room in October, we have been overwhelmed with the positive benefits it has brought to the children.
