A motorist says he is lucky to be alive after a shop collapsed onto his car in Greater Manchester today.

Nick Kay, 30, was planning to drive to the shops in Stockport when he heard what he thought was an earthquake.

The sound was actually the abandoned furniture store next door falling down on top his £5,000 BMW, bought with inheritance money from his grandmother.

Mr Kay said: 'The building shook. It felt like an earthquake. I was going to go out to Tesco in the car but I decided to stay in. If not for that I would have been in the car.

'The driver's side was crushed. If you're car is going to be damaged you think it might be a break-in, not this. I've had it for three years and it's my pride and joy.'

The ten-year-old car was written off in the accident which happened at around 7pm on Thursday.

Mr Kay said he and other residents had complained to the council about the 'dangerous' former furniture shop, which has been empty for eight years.

He added: 'It was only a matter of time before that building crumbled. It's just been left there to rot. There was even a tree growing out of the roof.

'There's actually a bench right outside and there are always students or mums with their kids there. I'm convinced if it had happened two or three hours earlier there would have been a casualty or even a death.'

Building inspectors were at the scene, near the Robinson's brewery, yesterday amid fears about adjoining buildings.

The chimney stack and part of the ground floor was left standing, but everything else fell into the street. Five people were evacuated and the road was closed off.

Mr Kay says there was a bench outside the shop which mums and students used to sit on, and that if the accident had happened hours earlier somebody may have been injured
