'Evil' plot: Nilanka De Silva, 34, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was today sent to prison for 20 months

A cash-strapped currency exchange owner was today jailed for recruited a gang of thieves to steal £10,000 from his wealthy mistress.

Nilanka De Silva, 34, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was sent to prison for 20 months after hatching the ‘evil’ plot in a desperate attempt to pay back a debt of £40,000 he owed to lover Kirti Mistry.

The holistic therapist was left traumatised after she was mugged at Victoria Coach Station in Central London as she headed to Leicester to pay for medical treatment for her mother.

She confided in De Silva, unaware he was responsible for the attack, and the plot was only exposed because one of the thieves was an experienced criminal under police surveillance.

Sentencing married father-of-two De Silva, Recorder Francis Bacon said: ‘You hatched what I consider to be a thoroughly dishonest and evil plan to give her some money and arrange for this money to be stolen.

‘You were the person Ms Mistry confided in and you pretended you had nothing to do with what happened on that day. You behaved abysmally and you have brought shame upon yourself, your family and everyone who knows you.’

De Silva’s gang members Christopher Wynter, 34, Pedro Lewis, also 34, Blaine Ryan, 22, and Matthew Williams, 29, were jailed for a total of four-and-a-half years. Wynter was jailed for 18 months, Lewis for 14 months, Williams for 12 months and Ryan for 10 months.

Prosecutor James Norman told Southwark Crown Court: ‘De Silva was in an intimate relationship with Ms Mistry and knew she was transporting a large amount of cash.

‘He arranged for the cash to be stolen
by the other defendants. Ms Mistry met De Silva in 2010. Their contact 
fizzled out but they met in 2012 and a sexual relationship developed. 

‘She
took up a premises a stone’s throw from De Silva’s currency exchange in
Greenwich. She gave him £40,000 in cash, her savings.

‘She did that because she trusted him to 
look after it for her and he persuaded her that it would be safer at his
business premises rather than at her flat, and she believed him.’

But on February 22 this year she asked 
for the £40,000 back because she needed it to pay for her mother’s 
treatment. 

Mr Norman said: ‘He was unable to give her any money and for 
the succeeding few days avoided her.

'You behaved abysmally and you have brought shame upon yourself, your family and everyone who knows you'

‘When she eventually got hold of him, he told her he would have half the money by March and the remainder by the middle of the following week.’

When De Silva learned she was travelling with £10,000 on March 3 he plotted to steal it and pay her back with her own money.

He tipped off Wynter, who tasked Ryan to drop off Williams in Greenwich to follow her to Victoria.

Lewis
was ready to pounce when she arrived at the coach station in the 
afternoon, Southwark Crown Court heard. Andy Hill, defending De Silva, 
said he planned to sell his house to repay his ex-lover.

‘He holds himself responsible for the sums of money that are outstanding to the victim and he feels he betrayed her. He was in a relationship with Ms Mistry 
and there is a betrayal of her by his actions.

'He is unable to look 
himself in the mirror because of what he has done, not only to her but 
his own family and his own prospects.’

Tejal-Rome Karia, representing Lewis, said he became involved in the plot to ‘clear some debts and loosen the noose around his neck for a while', adding: ‘He was not involved in the planning of the offence and does not know De Silva and Wynter.’

Richard Barrett, for Ryan, a father of two, said he only became involved on the day and was ‘genuinely remorseful’.

De Silva, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent; Wynter, of Hampton, Surrey; Ryan, of Willesden, north-west London; Williams, of Maida Vale, west London; and Lewis, of Willesden, all admitted conspiracy to steal. They were also all ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge.
