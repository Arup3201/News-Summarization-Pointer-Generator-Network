The pregnant daughter of a Romanian multi-millionaire is earning £60-a-day playing the accordion on London's streets, it has emerged.

Ramona Manole, 20, is the daughter of Ionita Manole, one of Romania's biggest stars.

However, although her father performs in Hollywood films and mingles with the likes of Johnny Depp, his daughter is begging in Britain.

With an average income of £420-a-week from passers-by, Ramona is earning almost 10 times what she could at home in Clejani, near Bucharest.

Her parents had a seven-year affair before they married but the relationship was short-lived.

While her father then went off to play in the 2000 movie The Man Who Cried - and then perform privately for stars including Tom Cruise - Ramona claims she was left with nothing.

'He knew that my mother and I have nothing apart from a bed to sleep in,' she told Romanian news site Wowbiz.

Although Ionita (third from right) performs in Hollywood films and mingles with the likes of Johnny Depp (far right), his daughter is begging in Britain and earning £60-a-day

'He is aware of my situation but let me get on with it.'

Ionita, a member of world-famous gypsy band Taraf de Haidouks, has accused his daughter of taking her act to Britain in a bid to embarrass him into giving her more money.

'The only reason for this whole circus is money, it's just a big gold rush,' he told the Sunday Express.
