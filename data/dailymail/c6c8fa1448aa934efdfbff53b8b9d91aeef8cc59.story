A Los Angeles filmmaker is planning his revenge on Abercrombie & Fitch who only want 'thin and beautiful people' to wear their brand by handing out their clothing to the homeless.

Greg Karber produced a video in which he drives to East Los Angeles to visit skid row and gives out the brand's clothing.

Mr Karber launched 'Fitch the Homeless' after reading reports alleging that the company safeguards its image by destroying unsold clothing rather than donating it to those in need.

Last week Abercrombie & Fitch, which doesn't make its womenswear above large, or pants above a size ten, was accused of purposefully excluding plus-sized customers.

Robin Lewis, co-author of The New Rules of Retail, told Business Insider the retailer's CEO, Mike Jeffries, 'doesn't want larger people shopping in his store, he wants thin and beautiful people.

'He doesn't want his core customers to see people who aren't as hot as them wearing his clothing,' Mr Lewis added. 'People who wear his clothing should feel like they're one of the "cool kids."'

Calling all thin people: Abercrombie & Fitch, which only employs 'good looking people' and doesn't make women's sizes above large, was accused of purposefully excluding plus-sized customers

While Abercrombie & Fitch offers men's sizes in XXL, Mr Lewis believes this is to appeal to muscular football players and wrestlers.

Mr Jeffries told Salon in a 2006 interview: 'That’s why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don’t market to anyone other than that.'

In 2004, the company was sued for giving positions to white applicants, to the exclusion of minorities; and in June 2009, British student Riam Dean, who was born without a left forearm, won approximately $12,000 in an employment tribunal.

Sex and six-packs: Despite the risk of alienating 
potential 'larger' customers, Mr Jeffries sees it as good branding to exclude these particular 
shoppers

Managers at Abercrombie & Fitch's London store had forced her to work in the stock room, out of sight of customers.

And last year, it emerged staff were 
forced to carry out military-style exercises while at work, in order to 
maintain the 'thin and beautiful' aesthetic they had been hired for.

Company policy: CEO, Mike Jeffries, 'doesn't want larger people shopping in his store, he wants thin and beautiful people'

According to a company email, male employees at the retailer's Milan flagship had to carry out ten push-ups, while women who failed to measure up were given ten squats.

Despite the risk of alienating 
potential customers (both H&M and American Eagle offer XXL sizes for
 men and women, and use models larger than size 12 in advertising 
campaigns), Mr Jeffries sees it as good branding to exclude particular 
shoppers.

'In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,' he explained candidly.

'We
 go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid 
with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong
 [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? 
Absolutely.'

He argues that ostracizing some customers, by using sex and six-packs to sell clothes, leaves his loyal customers wanting more.

'Those
 companies that are in trouble are trying to target everybody: young, 
old, fat, skinny. But then you become totally vanilla. You don’t 
alienate anybody, but you don’t excite anybody, either,' he said.

But
 it might be time to change this dated business model. Plus-size, 
generally referring to U.S. 14 and above, makes up 67per cent of 
America's purchasing population.
