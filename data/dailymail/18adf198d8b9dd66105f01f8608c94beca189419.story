A woman has created a unique family album by photoshopping herself into snapshots from her mother's childhood, in order to imagine the kind of friendship that the two might have shared growing up.

Danielle Delph, an art director from Portland, Oregon, managed to seamlessly merge a series of images of herself as a child with older snapshots of her mother in order to create the heartwarming collection of photos, titled If I Had Known My Mother Back Then. 

'I've always wondered if my mom and I would have been friends had we grown up together,' Danielle wrote on her website.

'Would we be in the same classes? Would we have the same sense of humor? Would people tell us we were inseparable?

'After seeing myself in her childhood photos, I'm pretty sure we would have been great friends.'

The images show the pair 'posing' together at various stages of their lives, from early childhood right up until what appears to be their teenage years. In one of the snaps, Danielle has edited herself into an image so it seems she is posing alongside her mother before a night out, with both women sporting smart dresses and glamorous make-up looks.

In another, the pair can be seen as young children wearing costumes, perhaps in preparation for Halloween.

Danielle revealed to MailOnline that the whole process to six months to complete. 

'It took about six months; harassing my mother to send me every old photo of her life was tricky because we had lost the majority of both our childhood photos when Hurricane Ivan destroyed our home in Pensacola, Florida,' the 25-year-old said. 'So I had a limited amount of photos to work with. 

'I'm pretty sure we would have been great friends': Writing on her website, Danielle confessed that she thinks the pair would have bonded

'I scanned all the images where we were the closest in age, and hunted through my Facebook photo albums to find childhood photos of myself. From there, I tried different juxtapositions in Photoshop trying to tell the story of two little girls growing up together.

'I'm really happy with how the project turned out. I was surprised at how natural the interactions were considering I was working with images of two little girls born a generation apart.'

In addition to posting the images on her site, Danielle also took the opportunity to pay tribute to her mother, writing: 'Thanks Mom for being the same friend to me now, that you would have been then.'

Danielle confessed that she gave her mother little warning about the project and asked her to send the childhood snaps without knowing what they would be used for. Unsurprisingly however, her mom was thrilled with the outcome.

Friendly fun: Danielle managed to seamlessly merge herself into many of the images

'[My mom] is miles away so I didn't get to see her reaction in person, but she tells me it's just so special,' Danielle added. 'She looks at the site everyday - well now she calls it our site - and it makes her cry. 

'She made an interesting comment about how it feels really deja vu, which is strange, almost as if now when she thinks back on those moments from her childhood I was actually there.'  

In many of the images, it's almost impossible to separate Danielle from her mother thanks to the art director's seamless editing process. 

And in the final photo shared by Danielle, a recent picture of herself with her mother, it's clear to see that the pair still bear an uncanny resemblance to one another, despite being separated in age.
