Personal preference? Luz Avilla, 34, allegedly drunkenly fled as she was pursued by police because she was trying to get a county over, where she preferred the jails

An allegedly drunk Oklahoma driver fled from police, but not to avoid a DUI charge.

instead, Luz Avilla, 34, said she was just hoping to wind up in a jail a county over instead of the one she was in.

However, Avilla and her friends didn't make it out of Grady County and into Caddo despite reaching speeds police say reached 100MPH.

'Instead of pulling over, the driver accelerated to speeds approximately 90 to 100 miles per hour,' Shannon McClain of Chickasha Police told KWTV. 'When you're doing 90 miles an hour and you're weaving all over the road, just the slightest movements by those other vehicles could be catastrophe.'

Dash cam footage shows Avilla's car swerving back and forth across the road as police pursued.

Just a few miles from the Caddo County line, Avilla finally pulled over, but the drama didn't end there.

Footage appears to show the driver refusing to get out of the car even as police draw their guns and backup arrives.

That's also when police realize the car is full of passengers, who they say were all drunk as well.

Dangerous: Footage from the police dash cam shows Avilla swerving down the road, they say at speeds that reached 100MPH

Stubborn: Even when police drew their guns and back up arrived, Avilla and her passengers--all of whom police say were drunk--the 34-year-old refused to get out of the car

Eventually Avilla and her friends get forced from the car, which is when she allegedly told them she was just trying to get to Caddo.

'Apparently the driver did not want to go to jail in Grady County,' said McClain. 'She wanted to go to jail in Caddo County was her explanation as to why she did not pull over.'

Avilla was instead charged by police in Grady County with crimes including DUI and eluding police.

Didn't get what she wanted: When she was finally taken from the car, police say she admitted she just didn't want to go to jail in that particular county
