He gave the 'salute seen around the world' and now he's inspiring people again by taking a simple step.

On Thursday Sgt. Josh Hargis stepped out of his custom built cycle, attached prosthetic legs, and joined his fellow veterans on the last leg of their 'Warrior's Walk.'

It was the first time mother Laura Heitman could see him take a step in person since he lost both legs from the knees down last October during a raid in Afghanistan.

Back on his feet: After a long rehabilitation process, Josh Hargis walks the last mile of a Warrior Walk

On his way: Hargis completed most of the journey with his bike before standing at the end, the first time his mother had seen him walk in person

'It was very touching,' she told the Ledger-Enquirer.

Brother-in-law Patrick Griffith organized the walk to raise money for the family.

'Without question there is a lot 
going on in their lives and this is only the beginning of a series of 
adversities that they will have to overcome,' Griffith posted on a fundraising website.

The walk was a 222-mile walk from Fort Stewart to Fort Benning, 
Georgia that began on Monday. It aims to raise funds and support for the Hargis family.

The group completed 17 miles each day.

Griffith said he was unsurprised to see Josh complete the journey.

'I didn't think Josh would do anything less than that,' he said.

Family and friends now hope to raise funds for the couple and their imminent arrival of their first baby, knowing they still have tough times ahead.

'Though we can't change what has happened, we can change their future,' Griffith wrote.

Wife Taylor is used to overcoming tough times.

When Josh made every effort to salute his senior officer while being presented with a Purple Heart, she spoke out about the pride she felt about her husband's brave action.

Hargis
 was thought to be unconscious during the ceremony when all of the 
sudden he began moving as he appeared to salute the officer.

His
 wife Taylor was not in the room at the time but her husband's commander
 sent her a picture of the heart-warming moment, saying that 'grown men 
began to weep'.

Army Ranger Josh Hargis courageously brought his right hand up to salute during a Purple Heart ceremony at his bedside in intensive care. His comrades thought he was unconscious

Proud: Taylor Hargis has revealed that she is pregnant with Josh's child and she couldn't be more proud of him

The honor of a Purple Heart is not the only good news in the Hargis household as Taylor has now revealed that she is in the 'very early' stages of pregnancy.

'I'm very fortunate that heâ€™s here, that he's still alive and we still get to have our life together,' she told NBC Nightly News. 

The photo of her husband showing no sign of concern over his own comfort in order to show respect to his officer has won him fans around the world.

'It moves me to tears. I think that's why it's gotten so much attention because it's moving people. It's just such an amazing thing that he's done and that he did,' she said.

Dad-to-be: Hargis and his wife are expecting their first child and he'll be on his feet for the birth

Lucky: Taylor said that she is so happy that they will still be able to have a life together as so many of his colleagues died including four in his same unit

By his side: The Purple Heart ceremony took place in Germany before he was transferred to the United States, where Taylor has been with him in the hospital

'I was just amazed I was just overcome with pride. That's my husband. He's an amazing man.

'Everyone that knows Josh is not surprised, that's just the kind of man he is.'

Hargis has suffered serious leg injuries after a female suicide bomber detonated her explosives in Panjwai last week, killing four of Hargis' comrades. He was on his fourth tour of Afghanistan.

In his effort to make the salute, Hargis battled a neck brace, breathing apparatus and tubes and even competed with a doctor who tried to stop him from moving to complete the mark of respect.

The brave and magnanimous gesture brought tears to the eyes of the 50 grown men and soldiers who had gathered in the room to witness the ceremony.

Inspiration: Josh's wife Taylor has shared the 
picture as it was the commander's hope that it can serve as an inspiration for many others

The simple gesture left a lasting poignant memory for the senior officer, who wanted to share the story of Josh's honor and bravery with the world.

Inspirational: Taylor got choked up with emotion during her interview

A letter from his commander to Taylor explained the gravitas of the occasion.

'I cannot impart on you the level of emotion that poured through the intensive care unit that day,' he wrote in the letter, which she shared on Facebook.

'Grown men began to weep and we were speechless at a gesture that speak volumes about Josh's courage and character.'

The commander wrote that he believes the picture, which he has hanging above his desk, belongs on every news channel and newspaper, adding he 'will remember it as the single greatest event I have witnessed in my ten years in the Army'.

The ceremony was held just prior to Mr Hargis being flown back to Texas, U.S, via Germany, to receive further treatment. Taylor has been at his side ever since.

The couple expect their first child in May.

Taylor has caught each 
moment on camera, and most recently shared a photograph of her growing 
bump to her Facebook page, adding: 'He is a kicking fool!'
