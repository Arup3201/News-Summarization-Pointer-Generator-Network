A new square in one of the UK's busiest areas has been officially opened to signal the completion of a £550 million scheme.

The 75,000sq ft King's Cross Square in London is a public space designed for use by local people as well as those using the nearby King's Cross and St Pancras main line and Underground stations.

Marked by the pulling of a Victorian railway signal lever and an explosion of streamers, the opening was performed by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Network Rail chief executive Sir David Higgins.

Grand opening: People walk across the 75,000 sq ft King's Cross Square which opened today as part of a £550 million development

More than a dozen familiar characters from London’s street performing scene, including James Bond, Charlie Chaplin and Sherlock Holmes, greeted commuters as they walked across the newly opened square. Other performers were dressed in Victorian-themed costumes in a nod to the station’s 160-year heritage. 

The square is part of
the £550 million development of the King's Cross station area which has
seen the old station rebuilt and the former concourse demolished.

King's Cross was once a notorious red light district.

Now, the redevelopment has helped to attract £2.2 billion of private investment into a previously largely derelict and disused 67-acre site, including 2,000 new homes.

Major international businesses are set 
to move into the area along with some 45,000 people who will work, live 
and study at King’s Cross.

Mr McLoughlin said, 'I have been travelling to and from my Derbyshire constituency for years and I remember when King's Cross and St Pancras were not places you would hang around. Now it is a destination in its own right.

'The official opening of King's Cross Square marks the completion of one of the largest station modernisation projects across our national rail network and one of the Government's top infrastructure projects.

'With more platforms, a redesigned concourse and improved facilities, work at this iconic station has transformed the experience of thousands of rail passengers travelling into London for the better.'

Matt Tolan, Network Rail said: 'As we reveal London’s newest open space to the public today, King’s Cross Square joins the list of impressive and iconic public spaces our capital has to offer, and what better way to greet the first passers-by than with a celebratory performance from the Square’s first entertainers.'

Features of the square include two improved entrances to London Underground, two new retail units, an area dedicated to public art, 19 new trees and solid granite benches.

The statues will be returning to perform at the Victorian weekend festival at King’s Cross Square on September 28th and 29th.

Back in the day: King's Cross was a rural area on the fringes of London until 1820 when the Regent's Canal was built. The canal was actually the first transport infrastructure rather than the train line
