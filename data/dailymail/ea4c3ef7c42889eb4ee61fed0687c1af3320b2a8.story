The comet which astronomers had been watching with great interest because it was passing so close to the sun on Thursday appears to have been destroyed.

Comet ISON, which had been branded the 'comet of the century,' was making its closest approach to the sun, skimming about 730,000 miles above its surface, when it disappeared from the view of space telescopes.

'Comet ISON probably has not survived this journey,' Karl Battams with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and the NASA Comet ISON Observing Campaign told a NASA Google Hangout on Thursday.

Experts said it appears ISON broke up into chunks and the sun evaporated it.

Observers had been hoping that ISON would survive its Thanksgiving Day close encounter with the sun and emerge to put on a big sky show in December.

'We have never seen a comet like this,' Naval Research Laboratory astrophysicist Karl Battams had said during a NASA news conference on Tuesday. 'It has been behaving strangely.'

According to Johns Hopkins University scientist Carey Lisse, even if the comet has died there is a good chance that people on Earth will get an interesting cosmic show. The comet's remnants could paint the sky with a wide swath of green in the Northern Hemisphere.

Comet ISON, which had been branded the 'comet of the century,' was making its closest approach to the sun, skimming about 730,000 miles above its surface, when it disappeared from the view of space telescopes

Here, Comet ISON enters the field of view of the ESA and Nasa's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory on November 27. In this picture, called a coronagraph, the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible. The comet is seen in the lower right and a giant cloud of solar material, called a coronal mass ejection is seen billowing out under the sun

The comet - two-thirds of a mile wide - is made up of loosely packed ice and dirt, essentially a dirty snowball.

It is a 'dinosaur bone,' from the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago, Lisse said.

It has been in 'deep freeze' for billions of years in the Oort cloud, a vast area of comets and debris that never formed into planets that's between 450 billion and 9 trillion miles from the sun, he said.

The comet is racing around the sun, pulled close by our star's massive gravity, which can also break apart the dirty icy core.

Comet ISON was first spotted by a Russian telescope in September last year. While many comets come out of the Oort cloud and return after a long trip through the solar system and many comets graze by the sun, this is the first one that astronomers have watched that is from the Oort cloud and is skimming the sun.

Lisse said ISON could behave just like last year's comet Lovejoy, which fell apart a couple days after passing by the sun. Its remnants were visible like 'a beautiful paintbrush swath in the sky' in the Southern Hemisphere, he said.

Comet ISON was discovered by two amateur Russian astronomers in 2012 and will come within 730,000 miles of the Sun today

Appearance: Comet ISON entered the view of NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on Nov. 21, 2013, where it can be seen with Earth, Mercury and comet 2P/Encke

Unlike many blue comets, ISON has 
been more lime-green because it doesn't seem to have as much carbon 
monoxide as other comets, Lisse said.

If
the comet does make it around the sun intact and returns past Earth, 
the Northern Hemisphere should get good naked-eye views just before 
sunrise and just after sunset in the first couple weeks of December, 
Lisse said.

But this 
probably won't be as bright and visible as 1997's Comet Hale-Bopp, said 
Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington.

Over
the last few weeks, the reports weren't good for ISON's survival. On 
Monday, astronomers at Kitt Peak Observatory 'were a little bit worried 
and depressed' because the comet produced a classic sign of flaming out,
Lisse said from the Arizona telescope.

Earlier,
astronomers thought it may have broken up. Then on Tuesday, a solar 
telescope spotted the comet and it was growing brighter just as it 
should have.

'It's a wild 
ride, this comet,' Lisse said. 'The reports of ISON's demise have been 
greatly exaggerated for the last month or two and ISON continues to 
surprise us.'

A composite image from the European Southern Observatory's TRAPPIST telescope in Chile shows Comet ISON streaking toward the sun on Nov. 15. The image combines four different 30-second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths

The comet, top right, has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout December and January. It could be the brightest for 100 years

The comet has been creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle of late as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail
