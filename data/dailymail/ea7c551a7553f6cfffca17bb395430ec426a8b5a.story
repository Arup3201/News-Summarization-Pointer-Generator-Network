It is quite probably the biggest game in the history of Royston Town Football Club - and it won't even be the first team playing.

The Hertfordshire club's under 18 side have landed a glamour tie with Premier League Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup and it will be played on Wednesday night.

The Crows first team, who play in Division One Central of the Evo-Stik Southern League, typically play in front of crowds of 200 at their modest Garden Walk home.

Non-league Royston Town will come up against the likes of Daniel Crowley when they take on Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Youth Cup on Wednesday evening in the biggest game of the club's history

Based: Royston, Hertfordshire

Nickname: The Crows

Colours: Black and White

Ground: Garden Walk

Capacity: 4,000 (150 seated)

Founded: 1875 

But that is roughly the number expected to make the 35-mile journey to Meadow Park in Boreham Wood to cheer on their youth team against the mighty Gunners.

The only non-league outfit left in this season's Youth Cup, Royston started their run back on September 10 and have seen off Romford, Bowers & Pitsea, East Thurrock United, Brentwood Town, AFC Sudbury, Welling United and Oxford City to set up this attractive fixture with the seven-time Youth Cup winners.

They will come up against such highly-rated youngsters Daniel Crowley, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Gedion Zelalem, all youth internationals. The last two have been involved with Arsene Wenger's first team.

For Royston club president Alan Barlow, entering his 40th year of involvement at the club, it's a moment to savour.

He told the Cambridge News: 'As far as the history of the club goes, it's a stand-out moment for us.

'We're the only non-league team left in the competition and it's a great achievement by the boys to reach this stage.

'It's the furthest we've ever been. We've had a few small rund in the FA Vase with the first team, but we've often been knocked out in the earlier round of the competition.

'It's got everyone at the club talking.'

This Youth Cup run is certainly up there - the furthest Royston have reached in the FA Vase, the competition for non-league sides, is the fifth round and they have never been beyond the third qualifying round in the FA Cup.

The first team finished seventh in Division One Central last season but they were 10 points shy of the play-offs.

The youth team, led by Liam McDevitt, are still unbeaten in the Thurlow Nunn Youth League, West Division and perhaps that explains why Arsenal are taking nothing for granted.

Young playmaker Crowley, who has drawn comparisons to Jack Wilshere, told the club's official website: 'If course we're going to take it seriously. You have to win your game. If you don't, you're out. There is a lot more pressure on you to win.'

The winners of Wednesday night's tie will host Crewe Alexandra in the fifth round.
