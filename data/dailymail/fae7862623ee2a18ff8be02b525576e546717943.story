Parades taking place across Greece to mark the country's Independence Day have been marred by anti-austerity protests.

Riot police carrying shields and wielding batons struggled to control demonstrators in Patras, while protestors scuffled with plain clothes officers in Agrinio.

Pictures of the scenes across Greece - evidence of ongoing public anger over painful austerity measures imposed by international lenders - emerged as Cyprus agreed a last-ditch 10billion euro EU rescue package to avert financial meltdown.

Athens' Independence Day parade took place amid a heavy police presence which saw onlookers barred from much of the route.

Armed forces units marched past the country's president, ministers and other dignitaries in an otherwise 
empty Syntagma Square in central Athens to commemorate the Greeks' 
uprising against the Ottoman Empire in 1821.

In a bow to austerity, no 
armoured units took part and no planes flew overhead.

Heavy security has been the norm 
since a military parade in October 2010 in the northern city of 
Thessaloniki, commemorating Greece's entry into World War II, was 
disrupted by anti-austerity protesters. Politicians were insulted and 
were forced to flee the scene.

Only around 20 protestors turned out to the parade in the capital and were kept at a distance by police.

Beset by a financial crisis since 
late 2009, Greece has imposed repeated rounds of public sector pay and 
pension cuts in return for billions of euros in international rescue 
loans.

The measures have led to a deep recession and record-high unemployment in the country.

Cyprus
today became the latest country to negotiate a multi-billion euro 
international rescue package to save its banks from collapse.

The
president of the Mediterranean island agreed a 10billion euro 
(Â£8.5billion) bailout deal with the EU, the European Central Bank, and 
the International Monetary Fund in Brussels.

The IMF said the deal, reached after 10 hours of last-minute negotiations, would form a 'lasting, durable and fully financed solution' to the crisis engulfing the cash-strapped nation.

But the bailout will see draconian measures imposed by Brussels to prevent Cyprus going bust - including the possibility of Popular Bank of Cyprus customers with more than 100,000 euros in their accounts losing up to 40 per cent of their money.

The deal will wind down the largely state-owned Popular Bank of Cyprus, also known as Laiki, and shift deposits below 100,000 euros to the Bank of Cyprus to create a 'good bank'.
