Skipping regular dental check-ups could end up costing you ten times as much money in the long run, according to a report by the PEW Centre.

More and more Americans are checking into the Emergency Room with complaints such as toothache, which could easily have been prevented and at a far lower cost. 

The number of ER visits nationwide for dental problems increased 16 per cent from 2006 to 2009 the report showed, and analyst fear the trend is set to continue.

Costly: People who forgo regular dental checks or don't brush their teeth regularly could face heightened costs for Emergency Room treatment.

Preventive dental care such as routine teeth
cleaning can cost $50 to $100, versus $1,000 for emergency room 
treatment that may include painkillers for aching cavities and 
antibiotics from resulting infections.

These infections can be dangerous, especially in young children, who may develop fevers and dehydration from preventable dental conditions.

In Florida, for example, 200 children were hospitalized in 2006 for those types of infections.

Hospital information from 24 states was 
analysed, as well as data from the federal Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality and studies on dental care.

Researchers claim the problem stems from a shortage of dentists, particularly those willing to treat Medicaid patients. In Florida, for example, only 10 per cent of dentists participate in the programme.

They also highlighted the recession as a contributing factor. When a family member loses a job, dental care may take a back seat to food and other necessities.

In 2009, 56 per cent of Medicaid-enrolled children nationwide received no dental care.

South Carolina ER visits for dental-related problems increased nearly 60 per cent from four years earlier.

Tennessee hospitals had more than 55,000 dental-related ER visits - five times as many as for burns.

But Dr. Frank Catalanotto, a professor at
the University of Florida's College of Dentistry, warned that using 
emergency rooms for dental treatment ‘is incredibly expensive and 
incredibly inefficient’.

Emergency Rooms are not generally staffed by dentists and are not equipped to deal with dental problems, meaning that many patients end up returning when they cannot find or afford follow up treatment.

Shelly Gehshan, director of Pew's children's dental campaign, added: ‘Emergency rooms are really the canary in the coal mine. If people are showing up in the ER for dental care, then we've got big holes in the delivery of care.

‘It's just like pouring money down a hole. It's the wrong service, in the wrong setting, at the wrong time.’
