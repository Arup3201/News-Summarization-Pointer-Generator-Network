Laura Bailey looks eternally youthful in new images for Wallis.

The model may be twice the age of some of her fashion world colleagues such as Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse but she proves she can still turn heads in this sultry fashion campaign.

The mother-of-two models key pieces for AW14 curated by the High Street retailer's design team and from her personal edit of favourites.

Looking fabulous at 42, Laura shows off long slim legs as she poses in sparkling mini party dresses, and a super fresh face in close ups wearing tailored coats and cosy knitwear.

'The Wallis collection for AW 14 exudes an ideal mix of grown-up glamour and rock and roll edge,' says Laura.

'I love the classic polo necks flecked with glitter and the pea-coats and boyfriend styles are the perfect winter coats. 

'Slouchy trousers and sweatshirt shapes are simply how I want to dress now, for work and play - relaxed and chic, layered up or pared down. P.S My new 'little black dress' is the little black jumpsuit.'

For AW14, the Wallis collection sees simplicity co-exist with decoration.

Pared down styles and modernity take on the overstated and dramatic as coats and separates continue to dominate and seasonal dressing becomes less relevant.

Minimalist looks for evening wear, soft pastels in cosy textures and modern, nomadic monochrome themes stand out as key trends, while overall styles become softened and oversized.

A spokesperson for Wallis says: 'We are really excited to have Laura to launch our collection and believe she brings an added element of aspiration.

'She has an amazing eye for fashion and knows exactly how to pull the perfect look together with her own individual style.'

She has recently modelled for Guess jeans, L'Oreal, Jaeger, Marks & Spencer and Temperley London and is a current brand ambassador for Chanel.

The multifaceted icon is also an established style writer and has written for Harper's Bazaar, Vanity Fair, and broadsheet newspapers such as The Daily Telegraph.

Laura is currently a contributing editor to British Vogue and cultural ambassador for the British Fashion Council.
