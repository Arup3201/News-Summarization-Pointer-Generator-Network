Two sisters who live more than 3,000 miles apart have given birth within minutes of each other.

The siblings even kept up with each other on Facebook as they both went through labour at home.

It was an almost incredible coincidence for Andrea Mansfield, from Melling, Liverpool, who gave birth to her sixth son, Michael on Friday 6 December.

Minutes before the delivery, her sister Audrey Westich, 29, gave birth to a baby boy, Levi, in Pennsylvania, USA.

Andrea was supported by community midwives Rachel Mavers and Amy Kelly, from Liverpool Women’s Hospital, who called it their most amazing home birth yet.

Andrea, 33, who gave birth 19 minutes after Audrey, said: 'It was amazing. We joked about it but never dreamed that it would happen.

'We both had home births, we both had boys and we gave birth on the same day, 19 minutes apart, although because of the time difference I was in the afternoon and she was in the morning.'

The women said they had been comparing notes and their bumps on Skype all the way through their pregnancies.

Andrea added: 'This happened because Audrey was five days late and I was two days early. We are going to call our boys ‘cousin twins’.'

Crowding round to see the new arrival with father James were Andrea’s other sons: Elijah, seven, Stephen, six, Daniel, five, Joshua, three and 12-month-old Benjamin.

Andrea said: 'I always wanted a bunch of boys. This was my second home birth in England - my other four boys were born in the USA - and the midwives, Rachel and Amy were fantastic. It was definitely more relaxing to give birth at home in my own bed.

Andrea’s mother Helen was in Florida at the time of the births and was trying to keep tabs on both her daughters as they went through labour.

Andrea is originally from Florida and moved to Melling after meeting her husband who works as a pastor at Skelmersdale Baptist Church.

Rachel Mavers, leader of Liverpool Women’s Maple Team of midwives, based in Kirkby, said: 'Nothing like this has ever happened before at any of my home births. Andrea and her sister were sometimes Facebooking each other during their labour.

'Thousands of babies were being born that day all over the world but it was amazing and a privilege to feel connected to two babies being born at home in two different countries.

'As a midwife, it is humbling to think you are just one of many midwives all over the world caring for women in labour.'
