Manchester United secured their sixth straight Premier League win after easing past arch-rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata's first-half goals ultimately proved too much for Brendan Rodgers' side to come back from, as Robin van Persie added a third goal late on to compound their misery.

Sportsmail's Neil Ashton rates all the players' performances at Old Trafford.

 MANCHESTER UNITED (3-5-2)

DAVID DE GEA: Two decent saves from Sterling in the first half, scaring the Liverpool winger into making a mistake when he was clean through at the start of the second half too. 8.5

PHIL JONES: Booked for reckless foul on Coutinho. Not fully fit but smothered pretty much everything that came his way. 7

Phil Jones - making his first appearance in two months for United - challenges for the ball with Adam Lallana

Michael Carrick put in another commanding display as he impressed against Liverpool

MICHAEL CARRICK: Decent interceptions and cheeky first-half back heel to befuddle Sterling. Looked accomplished in the libero role. 8

JONNY EVANS: Mock indignation when he was booked for foul on Coutinho. Deserved yellow. Leadership qualities not in dispute though. 7

ANTONIO VALENCIA: Sweet ball in for Rooney’s opener, but it doesn’t escape the fact United are in the market for a right winger next summer and are prepared to spend big on him. 7

Antonio Valencia provided a crucial assist for United's opening goal against Liverpool

MAROUANE FELLAINI: Booked for clumsy foul on Lallana after four minutes. Could have gone for early second half foul. 6.5

WAYNE ROONEY: Took his goal brilliantly and warmed to his role in the centre of the pitch. Booked for chopping Coutinho. Disciplined defensively second half. Excellent performance. 7.5

Wayne Rooney expertly steers the ball to give United an early lead against Liverpool

ASHLEY YOUNG: Trademark flail of the arms early in the first half, accompanied by appeal for free kick on the touchline. Did ok. 6.5

JUAN MATA: Miles offside for his goal but he didn’t hang around for the inquest. It’s coming together for United. 7

Juan Mata heads home from close range to double United lead's before the half-time mark

ROBIN VAN PERSIE: Exquisite finish again, top class. Had come alive when Young’s cross found him in the area to tee-up United’s second. 7

Robin van Persie netted United's third goal late on to add gloss to the scoreline

JAMES WILSON: Looked lost, which is a shame because with his pace Liverpool’s defence was there for the taking. 6

SUBSTITUTES: ANDER HERRERA (Wilson 71): Few decent touches. 6

FALCAO (Rooney 77): First touch nearly set up RVP for another but he was offside.

PADDY McNAIR (Jones 89): N/A 

SUBSTITUTES NOT USED: Adnan Januzaj, Anders Lindegaard,  Darren Fletcher, Tyler Blackett.

BOOKED: Fellaini, Jones, Evans, Rooney.

MANAGER - LOUIS VAN GAAL: Got it spot on. Again. 9 

Raheem Sterling - who spurned a host of golden opportunity to  score for Liverpool - is tackled by Jones

LIVERPOOL: (3-5-2)

BRAD JONES: Big call to play him and only excuse for diving the wrong way on Rooney goal is if he was unsighted. Cannot be blamed for offside second by Mata. 6

GLEN JOHNSON: Limped off after 25 minutes. Until then had added nothing for this game. Replaced by Kolo Toure. 5

Liverpool woes are compounded as Glen Johnson goes off injured for the visitors

MARTIN SKRTEL: Crazy to think that this was one of his better games. Imagine a bad one. 6

DEJAN LOVREN: Lively exchange with Gerrard at the start of the second half. Could not cope with Wilson, RVP, Mata and Rooney flying forward. 6

JORDAN HENDERSON: Beginning to feel sorry for him. Being exposed playing out on the right in this team. A winger he is not. 5

Jordan Henderson - speaking with manager Brendan Rodgers - was completed isolated on the right wing

JOE ALLEN: Should have been booked for 11th minute foul on Mata. Eventually booked for clotheslining Valencia. 5

STEVEN GERRARD: Dragged out of position for Rooney opener. Looks like a man who is ready to blow. 5

A hapless Steven Gerrard looks on after Liverpool concede their third goal of the afternoon 

ALBERTO MORENO: Playing him left midfield in a 3-4-3 is an experiment that is unlikely to be trialled again. 5

ADAM LALLANA: Lovely vision to create first-half chance for Sterling. Replaced by Balotelli at half-time. 5

The Liverpool youngster fires in a shot on goal but David de Gea was equal to the task

RAHEEM STERLING: Twice denied by De Gea in opening 20 minutes. Looks short of confidence, missed a massive, massive chance to equalise. 4

PHILIPPE COUTINHO: A marked man in the first half, drew three booking for United’s players. Actually looked like he could do something. 6

Philippe Coutinho looks to hold off the challenge from Rooney as he looks to get his team back into the game

SUBSTITUTES:

KOLO TOURE for JOHNSON (25): Actually added some attacking impetus to the team, even though he was playing centre half. 6

MARIO BALOTELLI for LALLANA (46): Hit bar from Sterling cut back. Mis-cued overhead kick moments later, had three decent chances to score. 6

LAZAR MARKOVIC for MORENO (68): Nice ball in for Balotelli to create a decent chance when he came on. 6.

SUBSTITUTES NOT USED: Rickie Lambert, Lucas Leiva, Simon Mignolet, Emre Can.

BOOKED: Allen.

MANAGER - BRENDAN RODGERS: Called this one wrong. 4

REFEREE: Martin Atkinson. 6

ATTENDANCE: 75,331.
