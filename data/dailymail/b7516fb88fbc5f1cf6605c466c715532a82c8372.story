Britain's top prosecutor has been forced to deny the country's first female genital mutilation case was a 'show trial' amid complaints that the charges came just four days before she gave evidence to MPs.

A jury cleared Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena of FGM in just 25 minutes after hearing he gave a previously-circumcised mother a 1.5cm stitch after she gave birth.

Now the Home Affairs Select Committee will put fresh questions to Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders, who defended the decision to bring the case to trial in a heated interview today.

She appeared before the committee in a highly-publicised hearing about FGM on March 25 last year - just four days after charges were brought against Dr Dharmasena.

Today committee chairman Keith Vaz said the charges appeared to have been brought too soon.

'This prosecution appears to have been borne in haste, 72 hours [sic] before the DPP appeared before the committee,' he told The Independent.

'We shall seek an explanation from Alison Saunders as to what she thinks went wrong and what she is doing to ensure successful prosecutions and convictions in the future.'

Ms Saunders defended bringing the case to court today after being told it was 'ludicrous and insulting to survivors of FGM'.

She refused to go into detail about the alleged offence itself - but said prosecutors had little choice but to pursue a respected doctor because back-street 'cutters' are almost impossible to find. 

'We prosecute the cases that are referred to us,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'We can't go out and target an individual. We know FGM is an incredibly difficult crime for female victims to come forward and make a complaint.

'Normally there are family and friends involved. The chances of a young girl coming into a police station to make a complaint about that are remote. That classic case is going to be a very difficult one to find.'

A Crown Prosecution Service spokesperson added: 'We make our decisions entirely independently and the timing is based purely on operational reasons - police refer cases to us and we consider the evidence as swiftly as we are able.'

Cleared: A jury took just 25 minutes to clear Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena of performing FGM after hearing  the 32-year-old was faced with a 'nightmarish scenario' when a patient cut at the age of six went into labour

A court heard Dr Dharmasena, 32, was faced with a 'nightmarish scenario' when he discovered the woman had been mutilated as she went into emergency labour at London's Whittington Hospital.

Originally from Somalia, she had been circumcised in a ritual ceremony at the age of six. 

Then a junior registrar who had no training on FGM, he performed a simple 'figure-of-eight' stitch after the child was born to stop her bleeding - which prosecutors saw as a repeat of the original act.

Bosses at the hospital said after operation in November 2012 that Dr Dharmasena should have sutured the area on either side, a different surgical procedure.

Lawyer Ali Hussain, who represented Dr Dharmasena's co-accused Hasan Mohamed, 41, branded the case a 'show trial' which provoked 'months of stress and humiliation'.

'He should not have been prosecuted and the jury's verdict confirms what he has always said - that he did nothing wrong,' he said. 

'My client strongly believes this case was nothing more than a show trial - an effort by the CPS to regain some confidence after failing to bring a prosecution despite FGM laws being in place since 1985.'

Dr Dharmasena's defence barrister Zoe Johnson QC told the jury at Southwark Crown Court he had been 'hung out to dry and made a scapegoat' for hospital failings.

The doctor, of Ilford, Essex, was cleared of performing female genital mutilation. Mr Mohamed was cleared of abetting him.

Both men said they had always believed FGM was a disgusting act.

Dr Dharmasena said: 'I have always maintained that FGM is an abhorrent practice that has no medical justification.

'I would like to thank my family, friends, legal team and all those who supported me through this difficult time and I look forward to putting this matter behind me.'

And Mr Mohamed's lawyer told the Today programme: 'He's made absolutely clear what his views are on FGM. It is a horrible practice.'

The landmark case faced criticism from the start. When the charges were announced last March Dr Katrina Erskine, an experienced gynaecologist, warned it risked putting politics before women's lives.

'Doctors and midwives will understandably hesitate, at the very least, before intervening,' she wrote in the Daily Mail.

'In certain situations, that potentially could cost a new mother her life.

Blame game: Zoe Johnson, defending, told the court her client 'has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the Whittington Hospital (pictured) and their failings'. The doctor had no training on FGM

The tradition of female genital mutilation (FGM) originated in ethnic groups spread throughout 28 African countries, including Egypt, Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, and spread across the world as groups emigrated.

The circumcision or 'cutting' is carried out for cultural reasons, including to demonstrate a girl's virginity on her wedding night. 

In cultures where the tradition is common, 'uncut' girls can be thought more likely to be promiscuous, unhygienic, and prone to diseases such as HIV/Aids, despite an absence of medical evidence.

The procedure is traditionally carried out by an older woman with no medical training and without any anaesthetic or antiseptics, risking infection.

Their basic tools include knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. Iodine or a mixture of herbs is placed on the wound to stop the bleeding. 

FGM is defined as any partial or full removal of a woman's outer sexual organs. It can also involve sewing up the vagina. It has been illegal in Britain since 1985, but this was the first prosecution to be brought.

Campaigners believe as many as 66,000 women now living in the UK may have suffered FGM, with 24,000 girls under 11 also at risk.

'Where pregnant women arrive in British hospitals having already had FGM, surely it's obvious that the only person guilty of that quite properly criminal act is whoever carried out the original mutilation.

'It's certainly not the doctor or midwife, who is simply trying to stop any bleeding and mend any tears after the trauma of childbirth.'  

'My concern is that following the DPP's decision to prosecute a British hospital doctor, doctors and midwives will think twice about doing what they know to be medically right.

'Stitching up a woman who has had FGM after she has given birth is not the same as carrying out the mutilation itself, and it's outrageous that the two things could possibly be confused.' 

But Ms Saunders insisted today: 'The legislation is designed to make FGM a crime no matter who commits it and it's not just about an original cutting of a young girl, normally when they're very young.

'This case was reviewed very thoroughly by the Crown Prosecution Service and we decided there was enough evidence to put it before the court.

'The spirit of the legislation is that FGM whoever it's committed by is an offence. It is a crime. There are exceptions if it's necessary for a woman's mental of physical health.

'The jury had considered all the evidence and seen it tested and heard it tested. They apply a very different test to us.

'If we stopped every case that went before a jury in an acquittal we would look at things very differently. This is the way our system works. The jury hears the evidence, it's tested, and the jury came to a very different conclusion to the one we did.'

She added: 'I would encourage any survivors of FGM to come forward and talk about it because that's the important thing.'
