Four teenagers - one female and three males - have been charged with allegedly luring a 16-year-old boy into a shed, shooting him with a BB gun, attacking him with a crow bar and carving a swastika into his forehead with a box cutter.

Police say they are struggling to find a motive for the gruesome attack, which took place on February 10 behind a house in Southeast Portland, according to The Oregonian.

The victim, Dustin Murrain, told police he was lured to the shed by a Jenna Jean Montgomery, 15, a David Douglas High School student who he had met earlier in the day.

Murrain said he was invited to meet the girl at Southeast 122nd Avenue and Powell Boulevard, according to prosecutor Christopher Ramras.

Jenna Montgomery allegedly told police that she and three other accused concocted the plan the night before the attack and agreed that she would be 'the bait'

Jess Taylor, 17 (left), and Blue Kalmbach, 15 (right), will be the prosecuted as adults for their alleged crimes. The fourth teen involved, Shane Connell, 14, will be tried as a minor

Police have said they are struggling to determine a motive for why the teens allegedly lured Dustin Murrain to this shed and brutally attacked him

When he did, she then walked him to a nearby home and he followed her into the shed in the backyard.

There, he was confronted by three other boys.

According to Murrain's account, he was struck in the back of the head with a silver crowbar once he entered the shed.

He also was ordered to take off his shirt.

Once
 Murrain removed his shirt, one of the teens, identified as Blue 
Christian Kalmbach, 15, is accused of shooting Murrain in the chest, the
 groin and index finger with a BB gun.

Kalmbach
 is then accused of using a box cutter to carve a 'swatstika-shaped 
insignia' into Murrain's forehead, according to the court affidavit.

When Murrain questioned what his attackers wanted, they demanded he return with a skateboard and money, the affidavit said.

They rifled through his pockets and stole his iPod, the papers said.

Murrain managed to escape and fled to a nearby auto service shop for assistance.

He was taken to OHSU Hospital for treatment.

Police then located the suspects at 3266 S.E. 111th Ave.

The 15-year-old girl told investigators that she and the boys had concocted the scheme the night before and that she was to be the 'bait' to lure Murrain to the shed, the affidavit said.

'She stated that they had all discussed a plan to lure him over to torture him,' the affidavit said.

Kalmbach, in an interview with police detectives, admitted he had shot Murrain in the chest and groin, carved a swatskika into his forehead and had forced him to eat cat feces, the affidavit said.

Montgomery, Kalmbach, Jess Taylor, 17, and Shane Connell, 14, were arrested last week, accused of second-degree assault, first-degree kidnapping, criminal conspiracy to commit first-degree kidnapping and first-degree robbery.

The four were booked into Donald E. Long juvenile detention about 4 p.m. on Feb. 10 and appeared the next day before family law Multnomah County Circuit Court Kathryn Villa-Smith in Juvenile Court.

Each entered not guilty pleas to the allegations.

The 14-year-old's case will remain in juvenile court, but the older teens will be prosecuted as adults for the Measure 11 offenses.

Ramras said he didn't know the motive in the crime, or if Murrain knew the three boys.

Murrain was rushed to OHSU Hospital for treatment after finally fleeing the shed

The shed was behind a home where Connell was living with his grandparents, Ramras said.

East Precinct Capt. Dave Hendrie said the case was disturbing, even to longtime officers.

'It was shocking enough that even 20-year veterans were like, 'Wow'... that's just another level'" of violence that they're not used to seeing,' Hendrie said.

A grand jury is hearing the case and is expected to return an indictment by Tuesday.

The victim's mother, Kelli Murrain, told KPTV she's worried her son will never get over the incident.

'He's been severely traumatized not just physically, but emotionally,' she said.

'It's something he's gonna live with forever, especially if the scar of swastika doesn't go away. Every time he looks in the mirror he's gonna have that memory.

'I'm almost ready to lose faith in humanity at some point, you know, all of this evil is running around, and with our youth.Â 

'It's bad enough that we have the bad guys out there, you know the adult bad guys, but these are young kids.'
