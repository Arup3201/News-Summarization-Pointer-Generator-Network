When children’s author Beatrix Potter dreamed up the character of Peter Rabbit at the start of the 20th century, she placed him in the setting she knew best - the villages and landscape of her beloved Lake District home.

Now, 110 years after the first Peter Rabbit book was published, animators have gone back to the Lake District, to create a new adaptation as close to Potter’s vision as possible.

The new CGI animation, to be screened on CBeebies this afternoon is based on 3,500 photographs of the landscape around Potter’s village of Near Sawrey.

Re-animated: The new CGI animated version of Beatrix Potter's Peter Rabbit will premiere on CBeebies today

Original inspiration: Using 3,500 photographs animators have tried to come as close to Ms Potter's vision as possible - this tree inspired Peter's Burrow

Coming to life: The animated version of Peter Rabbit's world, including his Burrow, have been inspired by the village on which Beatrix Potter based her books

The team - producers Silvergate Media and animators Brown Bag Films - studied the Lake District’s forests, grassy hilltops, farmyards and woodland lanes.

They photographed everything, started drawing sketches, working in the characters and their homes, and turned them into an animated world that is strikingly close to the real Cumbrian landscape.

The animated designs of Peter’s burrow are based on a photograph of a gnarled tree on the banks of nearby Esthwaite Water - with an added green door.

Mrs Tiggywinkle’s Laundry is set at the base of a stony outcrop on fells near Potter’s village.

True life: This outcrop close to the village of Near Sawrey where Beatrix Potter lived became the base for Mrs Tiggywinkle's Laundry

Stage two: After studying the photographs for inspiration the animators began to sketch the scenes and dwellings for the new series

Last stop: The final animation for Mrs Tiggywinkle's Laundry for the latest adaption of the classic children's book

And Mr Tod’s Lair is placed in a pile of twigs and branches, built around a mossy tree stump in woods close to Near Sawrey.

The homes of the other characters are set in real buildings and farms from the area.

The special one-off Christmas episode will be shown at 4.30pm today  with a full series to follow in the Spring.

Coming to life: It may look like a mossy tree stump to most people, but to the animators this was the natural choice for Tod's Lair

Foxy dwelling: Based on the tree-stump, Mr Tod's Lair began to take shape

Final result: Tod's Lair as it will look on the small screen premiere on CBeebies later today

The episodes will revolve around Peter Rabbit and his loyal friend Benjamin Bouncer, and the producers have added a new character - inquisitive, independent Lily Bobtail.

Kay Benbow, controller at CBeebies said: ‘I grew up with these books and so I am delighted to welcome this heritage brand to CBeebies.

‘This witty, exciting and action-packed realisation is true to the original work of Beatrix Potter and we believe it will have a huge appeal for the older end of our audience.’
