When a married woman came to believe her husband was having an affair with a college lecturer, she tried to vent her fury in an email to the suspected lover.

But after Donna Lees failed to receive any reply, she decided to communicate her anger to everyone who shared Claire Russell’s surname at Bath University.

As a result, intimate details of the alleged affair between law tutor Miss Russell and father-of-two Sean Lees have been widely circulated to hundreds of people – and caused much amusement for the university’s students.

Mrs Lees’s email, which was sent on Wednesday, reads: ‘Clearly you are equally as dishonest as my husband, given he has admitted today that he has been sleeping with you since September.

‘Has Sean told you that he left his SatNav in our youngest daughter’s car whilst I was on holiday two weeks ago?

‘It has all the dates and times of his meetings with you.’

Mrs Lees, who runs a Brighton-based fish supply business with her 49-year-old husband – from whom she has now separated – said she attempted to contact Miss Russell via what she believed was her personal email address. But when she did not reply, Mrs Lees decided she ‘would not just sit back and be ignored’.

Mrs Lees had wanted to send a message to Miss Russell’s college email address, but because she didn’t know which exact address was hers, she sent it to everyone with the surname Russell.

It is thought that Mrs Lees obtained the emails of all staff and students named Russell from the university website.

The email was initially addressed to 15 people with the surname.

It is believed to have since been circulated hundreds of times since.

In it, Mrs Lees says: ‘Perhaps you just like secretly s******g other people’s husbands?, in between your demanding work and family schedule.

‘To be the catalyst that smashes apart a whole family and destroys the trust and love between a father and two daughters must surely be a big burden to bear Claire...

‘Well done. I hope your conscience copes, although given it appears to match your morals it probably will.’

Mrs Lees and her husband have two daughters, Brooke, 20, and Paige, 18, and have been married for 23 years.

She said: ‘We were a very close family before all this happened, including him, but I just hope he can re-build a relationship with his daughters in the future.’

Mrs Lees, 45 added that her husband had admitted the affair ‘to my daughter, then admitted it to me as well’. She said that her husband and Miss Russell dated ‘but only for a few months’.

Regarding the email being widely read, Mrs Lees said: ‘I don’t really care if she’s embarrassed – that’s not my problem, if she replied in the first place I wouldn’t have resorted to doing that.

‘I have never met Claire but know of her through friends of friends,’ she added.

Miss Russell, who works part-time at Bath, one of the UK’s top ten universities, alongside her role as a consultant at Bespoke Legal Practice, declined to comment on the alleged affair or email.

She said: ‘I do not know Donna Lees and have never met her.

‘I understand from many who do know her, and from her actions so far, that she is someone who is unbalanced, and thrives on confrontation and drama.

‘I do not think it is wise to indulge her and therefore have nothing to say.’

One student who received the email said he found it ‘hilarious’, and that it has been sent around the university from friend to friend.

The second-year law student said: ‘I don’t know much  about Miss Russell, but she is attractive for a middle-aged woman.’

The University of Bath declined to comment on the incident, saying that it is ‘a personal and not a university matter’.

Mr Lees could not be reached for comment.
