The parents of slain Michigan medical student Paul DeWolf came face to face yesterday in court with one of the men charged in the murder of their son.

DeWolf’s parents, Thom and Kris DeWolf, 
traveled to Ann Arbor in Michigan for the hearing on Wednesday. They declined to comment when they left the 
court.

Shaquille Jones, 21, from South Carolina, who is accused of shooting to death the University of Michigan student along with Joei Jordan, 20, failed to make a plea as expected with his lawyer in the Washtenaw County Trial Court. 

DeWolf was discovered dead on July 24 from a gunshot wound in his own bedroom at a fraternity house that he shared with other medical students in Ann Arbor.

According
 to the statements, the suspects and a third man not yet charged in the 
case broke into Phi Rho Sigma medical fraternity and entered DeWolf's 
basement bedroom, startling him.

DeWolf went 
to get something from his dresser and one of the suspects tried to 
strike him with the gun, but it fired instead, according to the 
statements. Ann Arbor police Detective Katie Nucci recounted the 
statements at a Nov. 22 warrant hearing for Jordan and Jones, the newspaper said.

Jones' case has been postponed to February 19 for another pre-trial hearing, according to U.S. news website MLive. Jordan’s next court hearing is on May 19.

If convicted, the two men face a maximum sentence of life in prison.

The two men say they 
sneaked into Paul DeWolf's basement bedroom at his medical fraternity 
during a burglary attempt and that his shooting was unintended.

Last month the Detroit Free Press reported it had obtained police statements from two men 
jailed on murder and home invasion charges in the death of DeWolf, a
 25-year-old prospective surgeon whose body was found July 24.

According
 to the statements, the suspects and a third man not yet charged in the 
case broke into Phi Rho Sigma medical fraternity and entered DeWolf's 
basement bedroom, startling him.

statements. Ann Arbor police Detective Katie Nucci recounted the 
statements at a Nov. 22 warrant hearing for Jordan and Jones, the newspaper said.

Using data about a stolen computer, investigators tracked Jordan to Sumter County, S.C., and Jones to North Charleston, S.C.

A
 third suspect accused of firing the gun is jailed in Michigan on a bond
 violation in another case but hasn't been charged in DeWolf's killing.

DeWolf
 was a native of Schoolcraft in southwestern Michigan and a graduate of 
Grand Valley State University. He was attending medical school on an Air
 Force scholarship and held the rank of second lieutenant.

In
 her testimony, Nucci said Jordan entered through an open rear window as
 Jones and the third man remained outside. Jordan emerged a short time 
later with a PlayStation 3, taken from a basement recreation room in the
 house and hidden in his backpack, the detective said.

Jordan
 climbed back through the window and let the other two in through a rear
 door, Jones told detectives. Eventually, they ended up in the basement,
 where they hid in a utility closet when they heard two students coming 
down a hallway, Nucci testified.

The three of them then made their way to the room where DeWolf lived and entered.

Jones
 said DeWolf got out of bed "and was asking what was going on," the 
detective testified. She said Jones told investigators that the third 
suspect "pulled out a handgun and pointed it" at the medical student and
 "ordered DeWolf not to move."

Accomplice: Jordan and Jones say a third man who participated in the robbery actually fired the shot that killed DeWolf

"At some point 
DeWolf grabbed something off of his desk and/or drawer" and started to 
move toward the third suspect, at which time the man "raised the gun and
 attempted to strike DeWolf with the gun, and the gun at that time 
fired."

DeWolf screamed, and the suspects ran off, Nucci testified.
