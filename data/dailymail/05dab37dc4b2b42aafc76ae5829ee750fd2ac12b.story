If we thought that Andy Murray's final game against Novak Djokovic in the 2013 Wimbledon final was pure torture he almost managed to surpass that last night.

Cramping, limping and lolling around like a wounded beast, he stepped out to roll in his serve at 6-5 in the fourth set against Dutchman Robin Haase and, saving three break points, somehow managed to close it out by extracting errors from his opponent.

Of course this 6-3 7-6 1-6 7-5 victory in the first round of the U.S Open had nothing like the significance of the SW19 stomach churner, but it completed a bizarre set.

Murray now meets Germany's qualifier Matthias Bachinger, and the one positive of this event's format is that he has 72 hours to right himself after so nearly falling at the first hurdle.

Although the hot conditions were punishing on a difficult arena, he was left asking himself how he got into such a state after spending the whole of the post-Wimbledon period preparing himself in the heat of the American summer.

There were no hints of any physical difficulties coming in but he was lucky to get away with this. Opponents often get their brains scrambled when faced with someone struggling and that was definitely the case with the brittle Dutchman, who had a foot problem himself.

He could not hold his game together after leading 3-0 in the fourth following a run of winning eight games, although made it clear later he was not unhappy with the Scot's's conduct.

'I was very surprised it came on so quickly,' said Murray afterwards. 'I started cramping around the beginning of the third set. It was in my quads, traps (upper back) and forearm. The fact that it was the whole body would suggest that maybe it was something to do with my eating or drinking. I need to find out why it happened. I've been training hard. I don't think I was that dehydrated, because I needed to go to the toilet when I got off the court.

'It's not the worst I have ever felt, but it's the worst I have ever felt after an hour and a half of a tennis match. It was tough but it was also tough for Robin.'

Murray's physical demeanour was similar to the strange matches he has played in the past at Roland Garros, notably against Finn Jarkko Nieminen and German Michael Berrer. He has ended up winning after looking in physical distress although they were back issues rather than cramp.

This time he was icing his thighs, stretching his sides and holding his arms at a strange angle between points to try and relieve the tightness. Again the win was chalked, partly due to his improved returns and also the unforced errors of Haase when he was ahead in the fourth set at 4-2.

Support: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears was in the stands to cheer on her man during his first round match

Murray rarely sets foot on the Louis Armstrong Stadium without some sort of drama developing and it has been the scene of many scrapes in the past.

It is not, in truth, the easiest place for anyone to play. In addition to the tight dimensions the planes fly close by at La Guardia, it tends to be windy and the stewarding of the largely unticketed crowd on its large banks is invariably a complete shambles.

So there will have been some bad memories, including the enormous struggle of three years ago against Haase, when the Dutchman let slip a two set lead. Murray denied, however, that tension contributed to his condition.

Neither player ever looked entirely comfortable. Despite serving poorly with five double faults Murray took the first set after opening up a 4-0 lead.

He needed to break back to force the tiebreak in the second set, which he edged through 8-6, having been ahead throughout. It was very much a case of getting the job done in perfunctory fashion, and he looked fortunate not to be up against a tougher opponent, especially as his game plan sometimes looked confused with him hanging back in the court.

This will have been quite an education for new coach Amelie Mauresmo, who struggles to maintain the same poker face as predecessor Ivan Lendl.

Up next: Murray will face qualifier Matthias Bachinger in the second round after he shocked Radek Stepanek 

British women's number two Jo Konta later missed her chances in going down disappointingly 6-2 6-3 to Israel's Shahar Peer while Irish qualifier James McGee lost in four to Aleksandr Nedovyesov. Heather Watson plays on Tuesday against Romania's Sorana Cirstea.

Nick Kyrgios, the 19 year-old Australian, showed that his Wimbledon dismissal of Rafael Nadal was no isolated feat of bravado when he knocked out hardened 21st seed Mikhail Youznhy in four sets  7-5 7-6 2-6 7-6.

He was given three code violations for smashing his racket and swearing, the last of which cost him a game and brought him within one more offence of getting disqualified.
