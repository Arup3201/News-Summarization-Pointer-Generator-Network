Tourists heading to Venice will need to budget extra for new baggage thanks to a bizarre new rule.

Visitors trundling wheelie suitcases will be fined up to 500 euros, beginning in May 2015.

The city's reasoning for the ban? Noise pollution on the historic canal bridges.

Time for new luggage! Tourists heading to Venice are now banned from trundling wheelie bags over the historic canals

Any visitor using a rubber-wheeled suitcase will be subject to fines of up to 500 euros

Authorities say that the noise of large tour groups dragging the bags over the bridges keeps local residents awake at night, and ultimately, amounts to noise pollution.  

Only wheelie suitcases with silent inflated tyres, rather than rubber ones, will be permitted in the lagoon city, under the strict new regulations brought in by the council.

The bizarre rule has been brought in by commissioner Vittorio Zappalorto was appointed after the city's mayor was arrested in a corruption scandal.

Venetians themselves will be exempt from the regulations which are to come into operation in May next year, Il Gazzettino reported.

The news follows a series of attempts to limit the impact of the 20 million tourists that visit Venice every year.

This comes after a series of attempts by the city to limit the impact of tourists that visit each year

Earlier this year the city launched a campaign discouraging couples from attaching padlocks to the city's bridges as a symbol of love, claiming the old structures are too fragile to cope with the weight.

Workmen this summer removed some 20,000 'love locks' from the Rialto and Accademia bridges.

And last year authorities imposed a strict crackdown on water traffic.

After a series of complaints about drunkenness, gondoliers are now subject to alcohol and drug tests and must use GPS devices and number plates.

Venice City Council said in a statement: 'The rules respond to the needs of many residents who have complained to the authorities in recent years about serious discomfort in their homes linked to the movement of goods at times protected by legislation such as at night and in the early morning.'

'There are also numerous worrying signs of deterioration and wear to paving stones and bridges previously unharmed for hundreds of years.'

City official Maurizio Dorigo admitted the rules were currently a little impractical as suitcases with inflatable wheels did not yet exist, as far as he knew. 

He said: 'Hopefully a company will start producing suitcases with inflatable tyres. We've got till next May. Someone will be able to design and sell them by then.'
