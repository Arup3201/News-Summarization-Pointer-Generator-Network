The average commuter burns 324 calories getting to work and back each day

The average commuter burns 324 calories a day getting to and from work - the equivalent of a jam doughnut or a chocolate bar.

The Great British commute is as effective as 20 to 30 minutes on a treadmill, new research reveals.

The average daily commute takes nearly 57 minutes and sees people stand for 19.24 minutes, tackle 32.2 steps and walk for 22.66 minutes.

In a year commuters will burn 84,240 calories which means each person could lose 24lbs in 2014.

Top for working out while commuting were those living around Cardiff who burnt off 386 calories daily, followed by those into the capital who burnt 378 calories.

However, those living around Sheffield were bottom burning off just 246 calories.

Research shows that even small adjustments to the morning routines can make a difference – for example, doing minor exercises like bum clenches or standing on one leg can help burn calories.

Virgin Active found that 600 bum clenches can burn 50 calories, and standing on one leg while brushing your teeth can burn 80.

Laughing for 15 minutes can even burn 25 calories, tone your body and improve your overall health.

Hugh Hanley, from Virgin Active, said: ‘It's not always easy to invest time in getting fit which is why this research is so uplifting. It showed us that even the small things we already do are a step in the right direction.

‘The benefits that we've identified about the morning commute are surprising, so imagine the good we can do if we consciously make an effort towards an active and healthy life - things like taking the stairs, rather than the lift or clenching your bum on your commute to work can make a big difference.’

For people already making a conscious effort on their commute, the results are surprising.

On average bike commuters cycle for 25.22 minutes and burn 256 calories each way, runners tend to run for 12.29 minutes burn 125 calories.

Walkers spend an average of 21.56 minutes exercising and expend up to 88 calories before they have reached the office.

Tube travellers in London burnt the most calories.

Birmingham was found to be the running capital with nearly a tenth of people running on their journey to work.

Hilly Sheffield meanwhile is the driving capital of the UK, with seven out of ten choosing cars for their commute, while seven per cent of commuters in Belfast cycle to work.

Dietician Hasina Aktar said: ‘Just doing a few extra things like bum clenches and standing on one leg, on top of your regular commute, can expend over 500 Kcals a day.

‘This could lead to you losing one pound of body weight per week.

‘Laughing more is another great route to a healthy body and mind. Laughter burns calories, reduces muscle tension, increases amount of oxygen in the blood, exercises the heart and produces endorphins - happy hormones.’
