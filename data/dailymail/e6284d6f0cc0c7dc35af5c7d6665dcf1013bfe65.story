Donald Trump has withdrawn a lawsuit he just filed against city officials in a Miami suburb over noise-ordinance violations against his resort, which hosted the Miss Universe pageant last month. 

Trump spokesman Ed Russo was quoted by the Miami Herald on Thursday as saying that the lawsuit was being dropped in favor of negotiations with the city of Doral.

'In good faith, we have decided to voluntarily withdraw our lawsuit against the city, and we look forward to productive discourse regarding this matter,' Russo said. 

Records show that since August, the city's code-compliance department has issued more than 100 violations to Trump's resort, Trump National Doral. Most violations are for the resort's lawn maintenance crews making 'unreasonably loud noise.'

In the lawsuit filed Feb. 12, Trump said the ordinance 'is vague and ambiguous in its definition of prohibited activity, and provides the city's Code Enforcement Department with unfettered discretion for determining whether a violation exists.'

Trump rejects the noise-violation accusations against his resort.

'This is the finest resort in the world and you have to cut the grass,' Trump said. 'Why is it that we have brand new equipment and get fined, when the people who had the property before me didn't get any citations?' he said. 'Maybe it's because I have money.'

Trump's lawyers say each violation carries a $1,500 fine and he's already spent $50,000 in legal fees to fight the citations. They say since buying the property out of bankruptcy in 2012, Trump has pushed the city to amend the noise ordinance

The resort recently hosted the Miss Universe pageant.

Trump says he's not sure whether the dispute will interfere with the recently announced plan to award him a key to Doral.

'If it does, this is much more important,' he said. 'They may be giving me the key to the city, but I have not been treated right.'

Donald Trump, no stranger to noisy publicity, is complaining again about the roar of jets in a $100 million lawsuit over air traffic he says is purposely being directed to fly over his ritzy Palm Beach club.

Trump filed the suit against Palm Beach County last month, claiming his history of conflict with Palm Beach International Airport has led officials to spitefully redirect air traffic over his historic Mar-a-Lago estate in south Florida.

'I am saving one of the great houses of this country and one of its greatest landmarks,' he said in an interview, 'and it's being badly damaged by the airplanes.'

Rather than fanning air traffic in multiple directions, Trump says the county's airports director -- who has been named in prior litigation filed by the real estate mogul -- has successfully pressured the Federal Aviation Administration to have controllers direct almost all flights due east, directly above Mar-a-Lago, the lawsuit claims. It calls the actions 'deliberate and malicious.'

Noise, vibrations and emissions from the planes are causing cracks and other damage to porous stone construction, antique Spanish tiles, roofing, floors and columns, not to mention disrupting 'the once serene and tranquil ambience,' the lawsuit says.
