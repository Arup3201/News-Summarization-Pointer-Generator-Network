In the middle of the melee, lifeguards clad in orange stood on high chairs keeping a watchful eye over the swimmers.

Up to 10,000 people a day visit the 160,000 sq m park to play on its 40 rides, which include a wave machine and water coaster.

The park disinfects its 21,000 cubic metres of water every four to six hours, according to eChinaCities.com, to deal with any hygiene worries caused by thousands of people sharing the same water.

Wuhan is renowned for its steamy summers, with daytime humidity regularly hitting 80 per cent at the peak of summer every July.

The oppressive heat has earned Wuhan 
its title as one of China's 'Three Furnaces' - a trio of hot eastern 
cities including Nanjing and Chongqing.
