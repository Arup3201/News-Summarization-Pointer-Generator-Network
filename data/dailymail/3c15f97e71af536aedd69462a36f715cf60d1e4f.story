Some football referees can earn up to £70,000 a year - but Swedish official Jonas Eriksson may be earning more than that in annual interest alone.

That's because the canny 39-year-old became a 
multi-millionaire after selling his 15 per cent stake in a Swedish sports 
media rights business over six years ago for about £6million.

Eriksson, who has been a referee 
since 1994, is understood to be one of three partners who sold their 
share in the company, IEC in Sports.

The former journalist hit the headlines for failing to send off striker
 Robert Lewandowski after he elbowed Arsenal player Laurent Koscielny 
during Borussia Dortmund's win against the club last night.

Erkisson, who lives in the picturesque town of Sigtuna (above, file picture), just north of Stockholm, said: 'I've had a fantastic life as a businessman... but since 2011, I've dedicated myself to being a professional referee and I'm having the time of my life'

Based 
primarily in Stockholm, IEC has 
offices around Europe, as well as in the Middle East, Asia and Oceania, distributing 
television rights worldwide to TV stations and media companies.

Its current programme list consists of 250 events with a total annual volume of more than 3,500 hours.

The company’s archive boasts more than 5,000 events, dating back to 1993.

But despite Eriksson's wealth, nothing will change his first love as he continues to officiate in his home country and across Europe.

Erkisson, who lives in the picturesque 
town of Sigtuna, just north of Stockholm, told UEFA in August: 'I've had a fantastic 
life as a businessman... but since 2011, I've dedicated myself to 
being a professional referee and I'm having the time of my life.'

'All the money hasn't changed 
anything, the best thing I do in my life is still refereeing football,' said Eriksson. Above, Robert Lewandowski was fortunate to stay on the pitch after he was only cautioned for an elbow during the game at the Emirates Stadium yesterday, which saw Dortmund win 2-1

And speaking last year, he said: 'All the money hasn't changed 
anything, the best thing I do in my life is still refereeing football.'

The Lewandowski incident is not the first time Eriksson has courted controversy.

He bore the brunt of Rangers' wrath in 2009 after waving away penalty claims in a Champions League clash with Sevilla, with Scotland manager Gordon Strachan saying after the game that the Swede 'shouldn't get another game in the Champions League... he is not good enough.'

And he sparked more trouble in the 2011-12 season when he dismissed two penalty claims from Barcelona in their goalless draw with AC Milan at San Siro in the Champions League quarter-final.
