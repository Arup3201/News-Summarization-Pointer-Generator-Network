Detectives in North Carolina have seized the Yahoo! Internet accounts and phone records of a woman found dead in her home three months ago, in a scene made to look like a suicide but which police believe was actually homicide.

Sarah Catherine Long, 41, was found dead in the bedroom of her townhouse in Davidson from a single gunshot wound to the head on July 23.

Her death was initially deemed self-inflicted, however witness statements placed another person in the house on the night Long died.

The gun, a .357 Taurus revolver, was also found in her left hand - even though Long was right-handed - and there was no blood on the hand, despite the bullet entering her head on the left side.

Murdered: The shooting death of Sarah Catherine Long, 41, in July was initially suspected a suicide but has since been ruled a homicide. Investigators hope her internet and phone records will lead them to her killer

Scene: Long was found in the upstairs bedroom of her townhouse in Davidson, North Carolina on July 23

An autopsy determined Long had died three days before she was found from a single gunshot wound

A medical examiner determined Long died on July 19, three days before she was found.

Police found Long's body after being called by a man, William Becker, who said he had not been able to get in touch with her, according to The Charlotte Observer.

Becker then called police the following the day and set up a meeting with a detective.

Becker told the detective he and Long had started dating in April but the relationship was secret because of them were married.

Becker told investigators that Long’s marriage was abusive and that her husband had assaulted her several times, according to The Observer.

It is not know where Long's husband, Christopher Reeves, was at the time of her death. 

Becker also said that Long suffered from depression and had been having suicidal thoughts after recently being diagnosed with cervical cancer

However Long's doctor said there was no cancer diagnosis, and friends said she was not the suicidal type.

Additionally, Becker told detectives that Long had given him documents 'and told him to give them to her financial adviser, William Morgan, if something happened to her'. 

The documents listed Becker as Long's next-of-kin and awarded him $939,504.67 in the event of her death.

Searching for answers: Long is seen here with her brother, John, who said in a TV interview he suspects foul play in her death

Meanwhile, neighors said they saw Long enter her house through the front door with a 'tall, unidentified man', on the night she died, according to a search warrant obtained by WSOC TV.

Another neighbor told police they heard a 'bang sound, like a heavy slam', the same night.

Police are now hoping Long's internet records may be able to tell them who was in the house that night.

If a device, such as a smart phone, had synced with her wireless inter router, investigators may be able to pinpoint who that person was.

Police have also seized text messages and saved, opened, unopened and deleted emails from Yahoo! to paint a picture of what Long was doing in the weeks and days leading up to her death.

Becker has not responded to calls for comment.
