Hugo the bulldog eats, sleeps and plays with little white lion Igor and white Bengal tiger, Ice, who he has adopted as pups of his own.

The two-year-old bulldog even disciplines the lion and the tiger when their play fights get out of hand.

The three animals live together with former vet assistant, 26-year-old Or Lazmi, who is hand rearing the cubs.

Miss Lazmi, 26, said: ‘When Ice 
first got here she was about the size of a sausage so she didn't play 
with Hugo because he was too rough.

‘When
she was about five or six weeks old she was able to hold her ground and
we started to let them interact on a regular basis and they have been 
good friends ever since.

‘Igor
is a bit of an odd baby and mostly does his own thing but they also 
play together. Hugo will stalk him and then jump on him.’

26-year-old Or Lazmi, has hand reared several litters of lion cubs like Igor as well as baby tigers

The young cubs stay at Seaview Predator Park during the day and live with Miss Lazmi and her dog Hugo in the evenings

The young cubs spend their days at 
Seaview Predator Park in Port Elizabeth, SA, before returning to the 
nearby house in the evenings.

The
bizarre relationship between father-figure Hugo and his adopted 
children has grown overtime thanks to regular family outings to go 
walking and swimming.

Sometimes Igor will drag Hugo by his lead - but like the any good father makes sure to assert his authority.

‘At this point Hugo can still bully them around,’ said Miss Lazmi, a former vet assistant from Israel.

‘But
in about a month's time they will definitely be bigger than him - so we
will have to see how much of a bully they turn out to be.’

Miss
Lazmi, who moved to Africa to follow her dream of working with 
wildlife, has previously hand-reared eight tiger cubs and several 
litters of lion cubs.

The cubs are bottle fed three times a day and eat ribs now but when they grow up they will eat horse legs

The cubs' owner Or Lazmi said if the pups start to see Hugo as prey they will have to be kept apart from him

The cubs have been home-reared to help them safely interact with park vets when they are older and bigger.

Igor and Ice weigh two-and-a-half stone now but Igor will eventually tip the scales at 28-stone and Ice at almost 40-stone.

They are rapidly growing and are fed on a diet of ribs and bottle feeds three times a day.

When fully grown they will be fed a horse leg once or twice a week.

Meanwhile the biggest Hugo will grow is seven stone.

This huge weight difference means that despite their bond Hugo may one day have be separated from his adopted pups.

Miss Lazmi added: ‘There 
have been times when big cats kept their relationship with pets as 
full-grown animals but we will have to see how this goes.

‘If they get along and they are still friends that is fine.

‘But if they start seeing Hugo as prey - then we will have to stop the interaction between them.’

Igor the white lion will weigh around 28 stone when he is fully grown and will live cease to be bottle fed
