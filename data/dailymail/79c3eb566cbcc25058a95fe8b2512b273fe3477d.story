An angry husband has condemned the 'witch doctors and box tickers' running the NHS after his elderly wife died following a catalogue of medical blunders.

Retired teacher Mary Kirkby, 74, suffered such appalling and undignified treatment she was left sobbing in her hospital bed with a broken hip by staff who told her husband Raymond 'crying is what old people do'.

During her treatment at two different hospitals Mrs Kirkby, 74, had fallen over four times times after being forced to use a bedside cabinet as a walking aid.

Yet doctors failed to notice the fracture and put her back in bed. They also left the dementia sufferer wincing in further pain by forcing her to endure a course of physiotherapy - not realising the extent of the breakage.

Eventually doctors reassessed Mrs Kirkby, a housewife of Burnley after her husband of 47 years demanded further tests and an X-ray revealed the fracture.

But she suffered further indignities before she eventually passed away in the Royal Blackburn hospital last December.

Today Mr Kirkby, 67, a retired teacher who has made an official complaint against East Lancashire Hospitals Trust said: 'I have grown up with the NHS and in the old days you respected doctors like policemen.

'They had standing in the community but now I don't think they are much better than witch doctors. It is all about money.

'A doctor should not be saying to me "my best guess is" - that is not good enough for a man who has a medical degree.

'In my wife's case they seemed to be 
working on guesses. She kept saying to me "please do not send me back to
the hospital", but I had to.

'I do blame myself. She was cheated out of her dignity and was catastrophically let down.

'It has been tear-jerking seeing my wife of almost 50 years like that, and these are the last memories I have of her.

'I have a mix of anger and regret, all while trying to grieve, and I just keep wondering how I could have prevented it. She was strong, strong as an ox is and I'm lost without her.'

Mrs Kirby, who leaves three children and five grandchildren, had spent two years in and out of hospital following a series of strokes in 2010.

She was initially admitted to Royal Blackburn Hospital but was transferred to Pendle Community Hospital where she suffered her first fall in September 2011.

Mr Kirkby says he no longer trusts the NHS after the 'disgusting' way his wife was treated

The trust has apologised to Mr Kirkby, who said: 'Mary was cheated out of her dignity and was catastrophically let down. It was tear-jerking seeing my wife of almost 50 years like that'

Mr Kirkby added: 'She had no Zimmer frame and had to use the bedside cabinet - which is on wheels. But where were the nurses? They must have seen her struggling.

'Then when she was sent to Pendle, there were three more falls over the next week. One could be an accident, two unfortunate, three carelessness...but four? That is just gross negligence.

'When I went in she was very agitated and she screamed when I touched her knee. But when I told the nurses that she was in pain, they disagreed, saying: "No she's not - she's an old lady [and] they do it because they can" and "crying is what old people do".

'She had been in pain for six days but obviously she couldn't tell them because she couldn't talk [because of the stroke]. I kept pushing for help and eventually a doctor got an X-ray done and she was found to have a broken hip from the fall.

'If that's not ringing alarm bells, then that's just not right. It's all about ticking boxes and not taking notice of the patients.'

During her time in hospital, Mr Kirkby said his wife, who had early dementia, was left in a nightdress soaked in her own human waste and at other times was left completely naked. She passed away on December 6, 2012.

He added: 'At Blackburn Hospital she was sat in a chair paddling in her own waste. She was wearing a nightgown with nothing underneath. How could the nurses let that happen?

'You wouldn't even treat animals like she was treated. I had to sit and watch my wife crying.

'Another time a nurse told me: "I caught your wife eating with her fingers". I told her the fact she'd sat there and watched her unable to use the utensils - when she was meant to be helping her - was a disgrace.

'I can tell that the nurses are frustrated but they cannot speak out because they are worried about getting sacked. I do not trust the NHS any more.

'What was particularly insulting was on the day of her funeral I received a letter from the NHS about how they planned to carry on treating her. The letter was even dated after her death. I just don't know how this can be happening in this day and age.

'There has been a catalogue of errors and it's disgusting.'

In a letter to Mr Kirkby, East Lancashire Hospital Trust associate director of patient safety and governance, Peter Weller, said: 'I wish to reiterate the very sincere apologies given to you by the matrons to whom you described your wife's experiences.

'The experiences you described are not acceptable and are not to the standard of care expected within East Lancashire Hospitals.

'There is very specific guidance relating to these aspects of care including very clear guidance on the use of clothing items for physically vulnerable adults which has been distributed widely within the Trust.

'I am extremely sorry that this was not always followed.'Â
