Ashya King is on course to start pioneering radiotherapy tomorrow in the Czech Republic.

The five-year-old, who has a brain tumour, was flown to Prague by private jet from Spain last week so he could be treated at the city’s Proton Therapy Center.

Daniel Pask, a close friend of the King family, said yesterday the boy’s parents were with their son at Prague’s Motol University Hospital preparing to start the treatment.

Ashya King will begin proton beam therapy at the center in Prague tomorrow, a family friend has said 

Asked if the cutting-edge cancer therapy was still due to go ahead tomorrow, Mr Pask said: ‘Yes, as far as I know.’

He added: ‘Brett [Ashya’s father] is very happy that Ashya’s there and in the right place to get the treatment – the place that they’ve always wanted him to be.

‘He’s not alone – he’s got his mum and dad. That’s the most important thing.’

Ashya will receive radiotherapy known as proton beam therapy.

The family arrived in Prague last week after being dramatically freed from Spanish jail following public outcry

Brett and Naghemeh King removed their son from Southampton Hospital without doctors' permission last month after doctors insisted it was unsuitable for Ashya's condition 

The treatment uses beams of protons to specifically target tumours meaning surrounding tissue is less likely to be damaged. 

Ashya was refused the therapy by medics at Southampton General Hospital who argued that his cancer was too widespread.
