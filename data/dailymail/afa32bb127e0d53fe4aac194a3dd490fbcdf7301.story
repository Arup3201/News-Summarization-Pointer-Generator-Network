Te Kapua Reremoana Hemopo is being sought by police. He has been convicted of causing unnecessary harm to an animal

A man is being hunted by police for beating his dog so severely it required its leg to be amputated in an attack described by the RSPCA as demonstrating 'wanton cruelty' and 'systematic abuse'.

‘This is the higher end of cruelty,’ RSPCA Chief Inspector Amanda Swift told Daily Mail Australia.

Te Kapua Reremoana Hemopo, 25, from Parmelia in Perth is being sought by police for cruelty to his 18-month-old Staffordshire terrier, Bobbi.

Hemopo was found guilty of causing unnecessary harm to an animal and could receive up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of $50,000.

In March this year, Hemopo repeatedly kicked Bobbi 'hard like a soccer kick', according to one witness, in the backyard of his house.

He washed the blood from Bobbi's face when witnesses intervened, only to continue to kick her repeatedly afterwards.

The beating was so severe that Bobbi sustained extensive fractures to the skull, a fractured jaw, shoulder and leg, as well as broken ribs that pierced her lungs.

'This is a stocky dog. They’re know for being a hardy breed, in order to inflict the injuries it had, it takes a level of force,' said Ms Swift.

Bobbi required eight days of intensive veterinary treatment and her leg, which was irreparably damaged, had to be amputated.

A veterinary report suggested that Bobbi had been beaten before and was injured and unable to bear weight on her rear legs at the time of the March beating.

'The lack of compassion is the one thing that really got to me,' said Ms Swift. 'To beat an animal that’s already injured. What could a puppy do to warrant that?'

Bobbi has now been placed in another home.

Though Hemopo was found guilty in his absence, because of the serious nature of the offence the magistrate wanted him to attend court in person to receive his sentence.

A warrant has been issued for Hemopo's arrest and his partner Vanessa Masoomian, 22, was convicted for failing to take steps to alleviate harm and failing to take the dog to a vet for treatment.

She was issued with a $5,000 fine and is banned from owning a pet for 10 years.

Anyone with information about Hemopo's whereabouts is urged to contact WA Police immediately on 131 444.

Gigi the Chihuahua was kicked so hard that she flew across a room, the injuries she suffered were so severe they killed her

The search for Hemopo comes as another Perth man received a $15,000 fine and was banned from owning a pet for 10 years after he kicked a Chihuahua so hard it died.

Stanley Robinson Clarke, 31, from Hamilton Hill in Perth admitted he kicked the pet dog, named Gigi, so hard that she flew across the room and hit a door on March 17.

Clarke had been drinking at a bar when he got into an argument with his housemate and came home.

When Clarke returned to his house, Gigi, who was staying at the property temporarily ran up to greet him and Clarke then kicked her across the room.

Gigi sustained a fractured skull and head trauma and though she was taken to the vet her condition deteriorated and she was then put down.

Ms Swift said that while kicking a dog was never acceptable, Clarke had committed the act without premeditation and had since shown a lot of remorse,

'He accepted his guilt... It was an instantaneous, not premeditated, spur of the moment, stupid thing to do,' she said.
