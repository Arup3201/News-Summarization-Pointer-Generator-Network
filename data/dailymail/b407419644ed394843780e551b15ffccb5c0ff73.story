Three and a half thousand miles away in New York, Princess Eugenie could be forgiven for thinking that her 25th birthday might pass unnoticed in the UK.

But the Queen’s granddaughter wasn’t reckoning on her father, Prince Andrew, who was determined, literally, to trumpet it from the roof tops.

In the middle of a Palace function, Andrew whipped out his iPad and used it to video call his daughter, who currently lives in Manhattan.

If that wasn’t enough, the prince got his 400-strong audience in the State Apartments at St James’s Palace to sing a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, accompanied by a trumpeter from the Scots Guards.

The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James’s Palace, saying: ‘We are going to do something new this evening.

‘The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it’s her 25th birthday today.’

Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved.

Andrew told her: ‘You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).’

He then turned to the lance corporal and added: ‘If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...’ There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones.

Eugenie looked delighted and said she was ‘very proud, Pops’ of her father’s role in the awards, which celebrate innovation and technology in the creative industries.

But the singalong did not impress his ex-wife, who joked - in the style of a Eurovision announcement - that the rendition scored ‘zero points’.

Sarah added: ‘We think you all need to go for choir practice.’ Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. ‘Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,’ he said.

The Prince, who used a Pitch@Palace event last year to send the first royal selfie, joked: ‘’What was it somebody said about children and dogs?’ 

The social media-savy Royal is also the only senior working royal to have his own personal Twitter account.

Eugenie has been in New York for the past year, working for an online auction house.
