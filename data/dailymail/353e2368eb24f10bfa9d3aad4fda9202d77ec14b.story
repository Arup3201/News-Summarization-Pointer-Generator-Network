Michelle Obama has hit out at movie director Michael Moore and other critics of the Oscar-nominated film 'American Sniper', saying it 'touches on the emotions and experiences' of many military families.

Speaking at the launch of  '6 Certified' in Washington D.C. on Friday, the U.S. First Lady said that she was aware that the film has been accused of glorifying murder and serving as war propaganda.

But she said: 'The number-one movie in America right now is a complex, emotional depiction of a veteran and his family. And I had a chance to see American Sniper this week on that long flight.

'While I know there have been critics, I felt that, more often than not, this film touches on many of the emotions and experiences that I've heard firsthand from military families over these past few years.'

Controversial: Speaking at the launch of '6 Certified' in Washington D.C. on Friday, the U.S. First Lady said that she was aware the film (featuring Bradley Cooper as Kyle, pictured) has been accused of glorifying murder

Mrs Obama was joined by Hollywood star Bradley Cooper - who portrays main character, late Navy SEAL sniper, Chris Kyle, in the film - and media heavyweights for the '6 Certified' event.

The initiative will allow TV shows and films to display an onscreen badge that tells viewers the show they're watching has been certified by the group 'Got Your 6' - military slang for 'I've got your back'.

To be approved, the film or show must cast a veteran, tell a veteran story, have a story written by a veteran or use veterans as resources. And it must do so 'accurately and responsibility'.

During the event, the 51-year-old FLOTUS said: 'We hope our country will welcome back our veterans - not by setting them apart but by fully integrating them into the fabric of our communities.'

She then spoke in defense of 'American Sniper', which has become a $264 million global box-office sensation following its cinematic release on January 16. The film has gained millions of supporters.

However, it has also weathered a growing storm of criticism because of the acts of war committed by Kyle - whose autobiography the movie is based on - as well as its portrayal of Islamic people.

Angry: Taking to Twitter in rage, Moore seethed of 'American Sniper': 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse'

On the same day the Clint Eastwood-directed film hit U.S. cinemas, Moore - director of Fahrenheit 9/11 - courted controversy by slamming snipers as 'cowards' who 'shoot you in the back'

Taking to Twitter in rage, Moore seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.'

Kyle, whose widow, Taya, attended the movie's premiere, was credited with saving hundreds of American lives by making 160 confirmed kills, which is the most in American military history.

He claimed to have shot down 255. The film reveals not only how the sniper, who joined the SEALS in the late nineties, became so successful, but also how the trauma of fighting in Iraq never left him.

Raised in rural Texas, Kyle was posted to Fallujah, west of Baghdad and a major battleground of Iraqi insurgency, in 2004, and it was during the battle for that city where he made his mark.

However, it was in 2006 in Ramadi, a city in central Iraq, that he gained his nickname as 'The Legend' from his fellow SEALs. In 2009, after four tours of Iraq, Kyle retired.

He had not only shot more of the enemy than any other American sniper but had also gained a chestful of medals, including three Silver Stars for gallantry.

In February 2013, the sniper was shot dead, alongside a friend, by a soldier they were trying to help who was apparently suffering from severe post-traumatic stress.

Despite Moore's condemning tweet, he went on to describe Eastwood as a 'great filmmaker' on his Facebook page, saying that his movie 'Unforgiven' is his favorite Western of all time.

However, he later wrote: 'But something started to go haywire with Clint in the last decade.' He then further criticized 'American Sniper' as a 'mess of a film that  perpetrates a 'racist sentiment to Arabs'

Following Moore's online rants, Sarah Palin was among many high-profile people to defend 'American Sniper', calling out the director for his 'disrespect' of U.S. troops.

Moore won an Oscar in 2002 for his documentary Bowling For Columbine, exploring gun violence in America and the main reasons for the Columbine High School massacre.

He is outspoken in his views against firearms and has previously described America's national symbol as the gun, not the bald eagle. 

During Friday's '6 Certified' launch, representatives from Warner Bros, National Geographic Channels and the Producers Guild of America were in attendance. 

Chris Marvin, managing director of 'Got Your 6 'and an ex-U.S. Army officer and Blackhawk helicopter pilot, said the campaign does not aim to show veterans in a good light - but in an honest one.

'Most Americans tell us that they only see veterans portrayed as broken or as heroes who walk on water in film and television,' he told the Associated Press via phone.

'We're missing something in the middle. Veterans are everyday people. They're your next door neighbor who helps you bring your garbage cans back when they blow away.

'They're your kids' fifth-grade math teacher. It's the person running for city council. You see them every day in your own life but you don't see them on film or television.'

Launched in 2012, the 'Got Your 6' group aimed to enlist Hollywood to help discourage stereotypes and promote more accurate portrayals of the 2.6million soldiers coming home over the past decade.

Surveys have found that many Americans presume veterans suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, are homeless or are addicted to drugs or alcohol.

The group has taken lessons from other successful efforts to change national viewpoints, including increasing gay rights, reducing teen pregnancies, encouraging colonoscopies, improving animal rights and reducing drunken driving. It has identified Hollywood as an engine of cultural change.

'This is more of a challenge than anything else. We're challenging the entertainment industry — myself included - to live up to the responsibilities inherent in the powers we have and with the reach that we have,' said Charlie Ebersol, a producer and creator of the '6 Certified' program.

Ebersol said films like 1987's 'Full Metal Jacket' by Stanley Kubrick and Clint Eastwood's new 'American Sniper' would likely be eligible for certification because they portray veterans accurately, even if the soldiers in those films aren't representative of the population of veterans.

Mrs. Obama cited TV shows including 'Nashville' and 'Doc McStuffins' as ones that share stories of 'our veterans in new and meaningful ways.'

During the high-profile event, she said telling veterans' stories honestly makes for 'tremendous TV and movies' and 'are good for business as well.'

Director: Despite Moore's condemnation of 'American Sniper', he has described Clint Eastwood (pictured) as a 'great filmmaker' on his Facebook page, saying that his movie 'Unforgiven' is his favorite Western of all time

Ebersol had his own list of shows with positive veteran portrayals, including the Jay Pritchett character in 'Modern Family,' Sam Waterston's portrayal of veteran Charlie Skinner on 'The Newsroom' and Seth Rogen's guest role as a veteran on 'The Mindy Project.'

In all of them, being a veteran was not their defining characteristic.

'We have a real opportunity to go way beyond the platitudes of the entertainment industry,' he said.

'We love to say, "I support the troops!" and "I've got a yellow ribbon!" but there's an actual, tangible way to make a difference. That's what the challenge is here.'
