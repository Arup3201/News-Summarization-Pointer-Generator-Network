These are the first pictures of the tunnel where 12-year-old Charlie Bothuell apparently hid for 11 days while police and FBI agents desperately searched for him, fearing he had been murdered.

Charlie was discovered hiding behind boxes and a large plastic drum in a tiny basement while his father Charles IV was being interviewed live on national television, appealing for his son’s safe return.

Since his discovery, Charlie’s stepmom has been arrested on gun charges, her two younger children have been taken into care and Charles IV has not been able to see his son as police have taken him to live with his mother.

Dark passage: Exiting the basement door from his father's apartment - No. 1344 on the right - Charlie Bothuell V walked to his right down the tunnel. The storage closet is to the right, and the exit door, which was oddly left open is further down the corridor

Hiding out: This is the first picture of the storage closet in the basement of the condominium townhouse where it is believed Charlie Bothuell V hid out during the eleven days he was missing

Found: Charlie Bothuell V was found hiding in his father's basement after he'd been missing for 11 days

There have been suggestions that 
abuse charges may be brought by prosecutors and allegations that his 
father and stepmom may have somehow been involved in his disappearance. 
His father has angrily denied the claims, calling them, ‘absurd’.

But
 neighbors in the upmarket condo building close to downtown Detroit have
 said they believe Charlie simply ran away and used the tunnel to come 
and go as he pleased.

One 
neighbor even said the home-schooled pre-teen had been spotted out playing 
basketball in the neighborhood while law enforcement and family carried
 out their desperate search.

MailOnline was granted exclusive access to the long corridor that joins all the condos and leads to the outside world.

The
 outside door is usually locked and only accessible to maintenance men, 
but crucially last week, it was apparently open so residents could get 
rid of a build-up of trash in a dumpster left outside.

That
 means Charlie could have left the property in the day, before returning
 at night. That would explain why FBI agents with search dogs could not 
find the boy during their exhaustive searches.

There
 is also a communal storage space – seen in our pictures – where 
neighbors believe he could have easily hidden. There is even an 
accessible bathroom in the tunnel. 

Missing: The townhouse in Detroit where Charlie Bothuell V was found alive on June 25

Escape: The door at the end of the tunnel - at the bottom of the stairs - was open all last week because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster. That means Charlie could have come and gone as he pleased. It is usually locked from the outside

Speaking
 to the MailOnline, the neighbor, who did not want to be named, said: 
‘As far as I am concerned this kid ran away, then he was found and 
that’s it.

‘He ran away two
 years ago, that has been in the news, so it doesn’t take a genius to 
work out that the most obvious explanation here is that he ran away 
again.

‘I have heard he 
was seen by some of the local kids playing basketball on at least one 
occasion. The door at the end of the tunnel was open all last week 
because people were putting their garbage in a dumpster. That means he 
could have come and gone as he pleased.

‘In
 my opinion he was going out in the day, messing around, eating and then
 coming back to stay in the corridor or in his basement at night. There 
is even a bathroom down there for him to use.

’He
 could have lasted down there for as long as he wanted. I don’t know his
 parents that well, but they seemed like nice people to me.’

Despite
 the neighbor’s assertions, there is still a significant amount of 
suspicion surrounding Charlie’s parents, with many suggesting he would 
not have been able to stay hidden without an adult’s involvement.

Stepmom
 Monique Dillard-Bothuell was arrested on Thursday after apparently 
violating parole relating to a previous arrest on a gun charge.

Authorities
 had obtained a warrant for Monique Bothuell's arrest on Monday, but 
held out until Thursday to take her into custody later claiming the 
search for Charlie took priority.

A place to hide: Charlie probably called this storage closet home for over a week and he had access to bathroom facilities - and the outside

Relief: Charlie was able to use a toilet located in the tunnel

The
 37-year-old had pleaded guilty to purchasing a pistol without a permit 
earlier this year and had been put on a two-year probation period.

She was in court today on the gun charge and released on a 5,000 dollar personal bond and ordered to wear a monitoring device.

Sources
 have suggested that Charles IV, a registered nurse, is a strict disciplinarian, who made Charlie follow strict education and 
workout schedules.

NBC news
 reported that Charlie was made to complete 4,000 strides on an 
elliptical trainer without break, possibly on a daily basis.

The
 news station went on to say that on the day of his disappearance he 
took a break from his routine and his stepmom reported him to his dad. 
Charlie was apparently afraid of his father’s reaction and decided to 
run away.

Police sources told WJBK that Charles IV allegedly beat his son with a PVC pipe. Blood was reportedly found in the boy's room.

The
 news channel said that the boy had claimed his stepmother was helping 
him hide out and giving him food - but the family attorney has denied 
the claim.

Arrest: Monique Dillard-Bothuell is arraigned for a probation violation of weapons charges at Frank Murphy Hall of Justice in Detroit on Friday, two days after her stepson was found in her basement

Back with mom: Charlie is now staying with his birth mother

Following his 
disappearance on June 14th, Charles IV and Charlie’s biological mother 
Africa Shippings who lives around two miles away both made emotional 
television pleas for their boy’s safe return. Apparently Charlie would 
split his time between his father’s and his mother’s.

Charles
 IV was on live television on HLN with Nancy Grace on Wednesday when he 
learned that his son had been found in the home's basement.

'We're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement,' Grace said.

As
 the shocked father struggled to comprehend the news - grabbing his 
chest and looking stunned - Grace demanded to know whether or not he had
 checked his basement.

'I 
checked my basement,' Bothuell said. 'The FBI checked my basement. The 
police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down 
there several times. We've all been checking.'

He
 said that authorities had even brought in dogs to check the basement of
 their Detroit townhouse but the boy had not been found.

Detroit
 Police Chief James Craig said when police found the boy, he appeared to
 be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did not announce 
himself.

Craig said that he
 believes it is unlikely that the boy could have constructed the barrier
 himself. He was also behind a large plastic drum and bedding was found 
nearby.

'There's no way he 
could have erected this make-shift area of concealment, I'll call it,' 
Craig told WJBK. 'He certainly was excited to see us. I had a chance to 
actually talk and embrace Charlie.

'He indicated he was hungry. He appeared fine.'

Craig
 told reporters earlier Wednesday that the boy's father had taken a 
polygraph test about his son's disappearance, but the boy's stepmother 
declined to do so.

Mr Bothuell's test came back inconclusive, WDIV reported.

He also told authorities that Charlie had ran away from home two years ago, but police found him after three hours

Overwhelmed: Bothuell clutched his chest and breathed heavily after learning that his son had been found

The father was on live television on HLN with Nancy Grace when he learned that his son had been found in the home's basement.

'We're getting reports that your son has been found in your basement,' Grace said.

As the shocked father struggled to 
comprehend the news - grabbing his chest and looking stunned - Grace 
demanded to know whether or not he had checked his basement.

'I
 checked my basement,' Bothuell said. 'The FBI checked my basement. The 
police checked my basement. My wife checked my basement. I've been down 
there several times. We've all been checking.'

He said that authorities had even 
brought in dogs to check the basement of their Detroit townhouse but the
 boy had not been found.

Charlie Bothuell, who was last seen when he took a break from working out and went to the bathroom, was discovered as authorities searched the home.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig said 
when police found the boy, he appeared to be hiding behind a makeshift barrier of boxes and did 
not announce himself.

Relieved: The boy's father was so emotional when his son was discovered that he hugged a reporter

'There's no way he could have erected 
this make-shift area of concealment, I'll call it,' Craig told WJBK. 'He
 certainly was excited to see us. I had a chance to actually talk and 
embrace Charlie.

'He indicated he was hungry. He appeared fine.'

In
 the basement, a tunnel leads from apartment to apartment and to the 
outside, meaning he could have come and gone when he needed to, WJBK 
reported.

Craig
 told reporters earlier Wednesday that the boy's father had taken a 
polygraph test about his son's disappearance, but the boy's stepmother 
declined to do so.

Mr Bothuell's test came back inconclusive, WDIV reported.

He also told authorities that Charlie had ran away from home two years ago, but police found him after three hours.
