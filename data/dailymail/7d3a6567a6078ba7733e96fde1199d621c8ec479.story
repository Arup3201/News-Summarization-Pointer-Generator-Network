A pitbull owner whose devil dog called ‘Poison’ savaged five police officers leaving a scene like ‘the sickbay at the Battle of Trafalgar’ has been jailed for nearly two years.

Symieon Robinson-Pierre, 25, was sentenced to 22 months in prison for failing to act while his dog sunk its teeth into four police officers after they called at his house to execute a search warrant.

As they entered the property the large brown pitbull-doberman cross - which was of a banned breed - began attacking officers in a 15 minute rampage that left three of them needing surgery.

Robinson-Pierre ignored pleas to call his heavily built dog off the officers and said: 'It is not the dog’s fault, you should have knocked and I would have let you in.'

Poison, which weighed four and a half stone, pounced on officers as they raided the house in Stratford, East London, in March last year, and clamped its jaws around one officer’s thigh.

It tried to drag him to the ground as another officer repeatedly hit it on the head with a metal battering ram, to no effect.

He eventually prised the animal’s jaws open with his baton but the dog turned on him instead grabbing hold of his right forearm.

It went on to attack other police officer in the front garden and was only halted after being shot dead by a police marksman.

Prosecutor Sam Brown told Inner London Crown Court: 'If you need a useful image in mind of the aftermath of the event, imagine the sickbay after the Battle of Trafalgar and that will give you an idea - carnage.'

Robinson-Pierre was jailed for what Judge Mark Bishop called 'an astonishing act of inhumanity and callousness' after he turned his back on PC Lee Bush as he was attacked.

The charges related to the dog attack on PC Marc Merritt, PC Lee Bush, PC Paul Garrard and PC Steve Bones.

He was prosecuted for the initial attack on PC Martin Corderoy as it happened inside the house.

Judge Bishop said: 'To state these offences so baldly does not do justice to the mayhem which this out of control dog brought to a London street.

'It was an extraordinary scene of carnage in a London street.

'What was particularly shocking and what aggravates this is that while the dog was attacking PC Bush not very far from your front door the evidence is that you and other man came to the front door.

Extreme measures: The dog was killed with four blasts from a shotgun after inflicting hand, arm and leg wounds on five officers who were unable to restrain it

'PC Bush was screaming for help, asking 
you to get the dog off him and one of you said "There’s nothing we can 
do" and the other said "You should have knocked, I would have let you 
in."'

Judge Bishop continued: 'You were one 
of these two people. You and the other man went back inside the house. 
That was an astonishing act of inhumanity and callousness.

'The dog was out of control and you did nothing to call it off or calm it.'

Robinson-Pierre, who wore a grey tracksuit top, kissed his teeth and glared angrily towards the judge as he was sent down.

PC Duncan West was with colleague PC Steve Bones when they received the call to the address.

The
traumatised police officer hailed PC Bones 'selfless bravery' as he 
grabbed the dog by the back of its neck and pinned it to the floor.

Judge Bishop echoed his comments today, saying: 'PC West said what PC Bones did was a selfless act of bravery - I agree with that.

'What PC Bones did was to go up to the dog and hold it by the scruff of its neck.

'In the process his fingers were severely bitten and indeed he thought one of his fingers had been bitten off.

'In holding it down it was then possible for other officers to restrain the dog with their riot shields. Even with the officers using their riot shields the dog was still trying to get out and bite the police.

'It was only with the arrival of an armed officer that it was unfortunately dispatched.”

The dog also attacked PC Marc Merritt’s arm and was 'literally hanging off' it as he swung around in an attempt to shake him off.

PC Martin Corderoy was left permanently scarred after being rushed for surgery and was off work for 85 days.

Judge Bishop also recalled the victim impact statements of PC Bush, who had to undergo plastic surgery and PC Bones 'who has had nightmares and anxiety' since the attack.

The judge condemned Robinson-Pierre’s irresponsibility as he sentenced him, saying: 'Living as we do in close proximity to others there’s no excuse for allowing the owner of a dog to let it get out of control in a public place.

'The sentence I pass is outside the top bracket of the guidelines because I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that I should pass this sentence.

'The sentence I pass is one of 22 months concurrent in each of the three offences.'

Robinson-Pierre, of Albert Square in Stratford, had earlier admitted to owning a fighting dog.

He was also banned from keeping a dog for five years.
