Moody's took the first step toward stripping Germany of its coveted AAA credit rating yesterday by cutting the outlook for Europe's largest and most pivotal economy to 'negative.'

The FTSE came under pressure as the ratings agency lowered Germany's credit outlook from 'stable' to 'negative' in a stark warning that no one is immune to the eurozone problems.

A similar move was announced for fellow AAA ranked economies, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Moody's said all three nations faced 
risks from Greece leaving the eurozone and from the need to stump up 
cash for potential bailouts for Spain and Italy.

Last night, the German government downplayed the decision with the finance ministry noting in a statement it had kept Germany's AAA credit rating the highest 
possible.

The impact of the move reverberated around the London markets this morning when the FTSE 100 Index fell 12.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,521.54 points but it has since appeared to stabilise in early trading.

Yesterday, it slumped by 2.1 per cent after a pounding which wiped Â£30 billion 
from its value amid concerns over Spain and Greece.

The German government said the risks cited 
by Moody's weren't new and were largely based on a short-term 
assessment. It said Germany 'remains in a very solid economic and 
financial situation.'

The
ministry said it had 'taken note of Moody's opinion' while stating the 
'estimate' put the focus 'on short-term risks, while stability prospects
in the long term are not mentioned.'

'The eurozone has initiated a series of measures which should lead to the durable stabilising of the zone,' the ministry said.

'Germany itself is in a solid economic and financial situation,' it insisted in a statement.

Moody's rationale for the downgrade appeared to hinge on a likely deepening of the crisis, which appeared to be reaching a fresh denouement Monday as Spanish borrowing costs soared and Greek reforms were on the rocks.

'The level of uncertainty about the outlook for the euro area, and the potential impact of plausible scenarios on member states, are no longer consistent with stable outlooks,' Moody's said.

Even if Greece survives, the agency warned that richer nations would likely shoulder greater burdens in future.

'The continued deterioration in Spain and Italy's macroeconomic and funding environment has increased the risk that they will require some kind of external support.'

That would send the eurozone crisis to a different level, it said.

'Spain's economy and government bond market is around double the combined size of those of Greece, Portugal and Ireland,' Moody's said referring to the three already bailed-out eurozone nations.

While Berlin has, until now, been largely unscathed by the crisis -- borrowing at below zero percent interest -- it has been at the very center of Europe's political storm.

The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has repeatedly been frequently criticized for its austerity-first approach and for not getting ahead of the crisis.

Moody's reiterated those concerns, 
pointing to a 'reactive and gradualist policy response' by European 
leaders as cause of concern.

Germany,
which is reluctant to have its taxpayers on the hook for profligate 
spending in southern Europe said it would 'do all it can with its 
partners to overcome the European debt crisis as quickly as possible.'

Moody's also announced that Finland's AAA rating and outlook were unchanged.

It came after a turbulent day for 
the single currency bloc which yesterday saw the yield on 10-year Spanish bond 
hit euro-era highs of 7.5 per cent as it became increasingly likely that the 
country would need an EU bailout.

Banking stocks suffered amid the ongoing
weak sentiment and following reports that they would reveal additional 
charges for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI).

Royal Bank of Scotland was 2 per cent or 4.3p 
lower at 193.5p, Barclays slipped 2.3p to 150.3p and Lloyds Banking 
Group dropped 0.4p to 28.9p.

Outside the top flight, Carpetright fell
2 per cent or 11p to 604p despite revealing an encouraging update which showed 
growth in UK like-for-like sales of 1.7 per cent for the 12 weeks to July 21.
