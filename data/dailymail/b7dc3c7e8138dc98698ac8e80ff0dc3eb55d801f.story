Criticism: Europe's top diplomat Catherine Ashton has been skewered by a report which says she has failed to advance EU influence in her post

Labour peer and top EU diplomat Baroness Ashton was branded a ‘national embarrassment’ last night after her work was condemned by MEPs – even as she demanded an inflation-busting increase in her department budget.

The peer came under fire from the European Parliament which said her department, the European External Action Service, was indecisive and unresponsive to crises.

In a hard-hitting report, MEPs on the foreign affairs committee said the EEAS – which they want to behave like an EU foreign office – is ‘top heavy’, has ‘too many decision-making layers’ and has been slow to respond to situations such as the Arab Spring and the conflict in Mali.

Yet Baroness Ashton, 57, who became High Representative of the EU for foreign affairs and security policy when the post was created in 2009, is now demanding a budget increase of £18million for 2014 – a 4 per cent boost at twice the rate of inflation.

That will take the annual cost of the EEAS to £451million.

Baroness Ashton, who earns £287,543 a year, has faced repeated criticism for coming across as  a political lightweight and for failing to offer comment on the financial crisis gripping the EU.

She will be replaced next year and will enjoy a £400,000 payoff over the following three years from European taxpayers.

Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘For the first time in as long as I can remember, someone in the European Parliament has said something sensible.

‘She is a national embarrassment. The organisation she heads is monumentally useless. It is absurd that it should be asking for more money.

‘There are many public services which haven’t had anything like a 4 per cent increase in budget for years. It’s ridiculous.’

Fellow Tory Peter Bone added: ‘I don’t know what planet some people in Brussels live on.

‘What we want from a leader in Europe
 is someone who wants to save money and control their budgets. To be 
condemned by the European Parliament takes some doing, but it is a 
wake-up call for her.’

A recent report by the European 
Parliament’s budgetary control committee attacked the EEAS for being 
‘top-heavy’ with highly paid officials and incompetent staff in its 141 
embassies or delegations across the world.

The report said: 'Even with an ongoing crisis brewing in Mali, it was France that ultimately intervened to keep the country from falling completely to Islamic fundamentalists'

The foreign affairs committee report 
adds: ‘It has become apparent that the EU is unable to ensure, in the 
short term, a reallocation of resources to match new political 
priorities.’

Tory MEP Philip Bradbourn said: 
‘Staff are paid too much to do too little and seem to expect the very 
best in accommodation all over the world. Since much of their work 
duplicates what member state diplomatic missions have been doing for 
years, the value has to be questionable.’

The Government has described budget 
demands by Baroness Ashton as ‘ludicrous’ at a time when governments 
have acted to restrict rises in the overall  EU budget.

A British diplomat said: ‘The UK continues to  argue against any increase to the EEAS budget.

‘All EU institutions should be looking for savings in their  budgets, not increases.’
