Thousands of revellers partied the night away oblivious to the fact that there were guardian angels watching over them to ensure their new year celebrations ran smoothly.

About 60 dedicated volunteers patrolled Sydney streets offering water, lollipops and even pairs of thongs for those with tired feet from dancing the night away in high heels.

What seems like a simple gesture is all part of a much bigger plan so that no parent has to endure the eternal heartache that Ralph and Kathy Kelly have for the past two and half years after tragically losing their son to a senseless act.

Thomas Kelly was king hit on his first night out in Kings Cross in July 2012

His parents Kathy and Ralph Kelly started a foundation in his honour to curb anti-social behaviour

At just 18-years-old, Thomas went out with his girlfriend and mates for his first night out in Sydney's Kings Cross when he was king hit in an unprovoked attack and killed by a complete stranger.

His parents started a foundation in his honour, and in conjunction with the Salvation Army, volunteers hit the streets every Friday and Saturday night wearing Thomas' initials which stand for Take Kare - the last words Ralph and Kathy ever said to their son.

A dedicated safe space is also provided for those who may have overindulged and are in need of a much-needed rest. 

Salvation Army lead organiser Nathan Brown said party-goers can charge their phones, drink water, use the angel's phones to contact family or friends to pick them up.

'They are feeling smashed, got sore feet and probably feeling a bit groggy in the head, so if we can help them feel a bit more comfortable or help get them home in the right direction I think it's the small stuff but hopefully that's intervening before things go to a really bad place,' he told A Current Affair. 

'This is a brilliant project and I applaud Ralph for his determination in seeing it set up,' Mr Brown said. 

'I think that Thomas would be blown away by the support this program is receiving and the volunteers who turn up to help serve and wear Thomas's name on their chest which is an honour for us - and I really hope we are doing him proud.'

The safe space, which is also rolling out in Melbourne and Brisbane aswell, is funded by the NSW Governement and Sydney Council but there is only enough funding for a three-month trial. 

'If it saves one persons' life it's definitely a service worth doing,'Ralph said.

'Most parents probably will have no idea that their parents were saves last night or the night before - it's really about making sure our kids get home safely.

'We are looking for an organisation to partner with us to fund this program to help our youth in the city and other areas around Sydney.'

Sydney's designated safe space needs more funding to keep going after the three month trial

There has been no serious brain injury as a result of alcohol at St Vincent's hospital in 2014 since the part of the new licensing restrictions which were introduced in February

His wife, Kathy, said her job is done if no other families have to suffer the way hers has  from a single cowardly punch.

'Life will never be the same - we miss Thomas deeply and it never really gets better i think people think you could you get over it but you never do,' she said.

Cass, 18, who is only just of legal age and doesn't drink much, volunteered to help patrol the streets on Wednesday night.

'It is a big task but I find because I'm so young I'm able to relate to people who are my age and kind of be like that mother hen,' she said.

The foundation  successfully lobbied the NSW government to increase licensing restrictions across the heart of Sydney now they are turning to the federal government to curb alcohol advertising.

'We have seen no serious brain injury as a result of alcohol at St Vincent's hospital for 2014 and that has to be a good thing and that's a part of the new laws that were introduced in February this year,' Ralph told ACA.

'Life will never be the same - we miss Thomas deeply and it never really gets better i think people think you could you get over it but you never do,' says his mother Kathy

But this doesn't mean that alcohol-fuelled violence is not still prevalent among young people. 

'It's very sad we see it keep happening over and over again and I think that often makes you feel like throwing your arms up in the air and saying "we've tried what more can we do?" but we have to keep trying,' Kathy insists. 

The foundation is also working on changing the justice system to put the victim's rights ahead of the offenders. 

Thomas' killer was initially sentenced to just five years jail for manslaughter which was doubled to ten years following an appeal.

'There's this terrible injustice going on in this state as we have seen on multiple occasions and that really has to stop,' Ralph said.

'We can not let these offenders roam our streets and be let off time and time again.'
