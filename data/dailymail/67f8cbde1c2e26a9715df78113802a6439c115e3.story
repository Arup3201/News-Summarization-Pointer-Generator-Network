Geoff Hunt killed his three children and wife with a shotgun before turning it on himself on their quiet NSW farm in a tragic murder-suicide last September, a coroner's inquest will confirm.

Hunt, 44, drove down to the dam and took his own life after shooting Kim, 41, on the entertainment deck at the back of their family home, Watch Hill, near Lockhart - 80km south of Wagga Wagga.

The couple's three children - Fletcher, 10, Mia, 8, and Phoebe, 6 - were shot inside the house. The shootings likely occurred in the evening of Monday, September 8.

An insider familiar with the case has told Daily Mail Australia that the facts presented to the coroner will confirm a predicted finding that Mr Hunt, for  reasons which are currently being examined, carried out the shootings.

Following the memorial held for the Hunt family two weeks after the deaths, there has been a persistent rumour among Lockhart's 1000 residents and surrounding communities about whether Mrs Hunt could possibly have carried out the shootings due to the stress and trauma of her recovery from a serious brain injury after a car accident in 2012.

What the police found:  A visitor to the farm first discovered Kim Hunt and her three children dead from shotgun wounds. Police investigators described the scene as 'shocking and disturbing'.

'There was a a lot of talk about that story going around, but it wasn't based on anything but conjecture. It appears that [the father Geoff Hunt] was responsible,' an investigator told Daily Mail Australia.

'It appears the shotgun was used a few hours before the police arrived. most likely the night before.'

The horrific accident which appears to have left an indelible mark on the Hunt family almost took Kim Hunt's life in July 2012.

Driving along the Lockhart Boree Creek Road, which cuts a path through thousands of hectares of prime cropping land owned by her husband's parents and brother, Allen, Kim Hunt's car flipped twice while four-year-old Phoebe was strapped in the back.

Ms Hunt was taken to Wagga Base Hospital - where she had been working as a registered nurse - with a broken neck; at the time, when she was transferred to Canberra Hospital and then on to Sydney, the expectations were that she might end up an organ donor.

At Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, where Ms Hunt experienced seven weeks of post-traumatic amnesia, she had to learn to walk and talk again.

When she eventually returned home, her speech was still slurred and the family needed in-house carers to help look after the children.

Ms Hunt later said the fact she had nearly died had made her a better nurse, although she could not physically return to shifts as  as an emergency room nurse, and was planning a  return to work as a partt-time nursing administrator in the months leading up to the tragedy.

Following the murder suicide of her sister's family, Jenny Geppert astonished friends and locals by delivering a heartfelt statement in which she made a point of not blaming brother-in-law for the deaths. 

The Hunt family had farmed grain on the NSW Riverina district at Lockhart for three generations before Geoff Hunt is believed to have slain his family and then took his own life

Ms Geppert said she did not believe the shootings were premeditated, saying they were a consequence of the injury suffered by her sister and the toll it had left on the family.

'A brain injury robs a person of empathy and love. Unless you live with someone who’s gone through this you can’t understand – it dulls their emotions,' Mrs Geppert said in a selfless and inspiring announcement just before the Hunt family funeral. 

A close family friend, Paul Routley, told Fairfax Media that while Mr Hunt had been a 'rock' following the accident, in which then four-year-old Phoebe escaped with minor injuries, he wished his friend had asked for help.

'The stress that's been put on them from the accident was just immense, absolutely immense,' he said.

'He was super, super patient. He would help her get out of the car, he would hold her arm. You couldn't get a better bloke. The most gentle, considerate bloke ... a pillar of society.'

The tragedy came to light when a family friend called in Watch Hill, reportedly after being unable to contact Mrs Hunt and the three children had failed to turn up for school.

From outside, the picture perfect homestead on the hillside looked normal, set between a paddock of bright yellow canola and fields of wheat.

But beyond the row of newly pruned  trees bordering the house lay a gruesome discovery. Inside the house  lay the bodies of Phoebe, Mia and Fletcher, dead from gunshot wounds.

At the rear of the dwelling, Kim Hunt was lying in the open with similar wounds to those of her children. 

Police immediately set out to search for Geoff Hunt and on finding his vehicle parked by a dam on the property, they retrieved his body and beside it a firearm belived to be the murder weapon.

The news of the seemingly inexplicable tragedy devastated the Lockhart community, which seemed at a loss to explain why the superficially happy family had imploded.

Daily Mail Australia understands that a short suicide note may have been written by Mr Hunt, whose third-generation grain growing business had survived and appeared to have prospered despite almost a decade of drought.

At the funeral of her sister, brother-in-law, nephew and two nieces, Ms Geppert spoke of Mrs Hunt's zest for life and devotion to her children.

'My big sister, my idol, my friend, what an amazing person you were, kind and caring, I feel lost in this world without you,' she said. 

A member of the Lockhart community who asked not to be named said that while 'country people were good at supporting each other they tend to ignore the underlying problems, hence the number of suicides in the bush.'

Forensic accountants are examining his accounts and the finances on one of the properties of the Hunt family who own thosuands of hectares along Boree Creek Road at Lockhart, and which Geoff appears to have purchased for $1.2m in 2013 with a partial mortgage to his parents, John and Lynette Hunt.

The NSW Coroner will conduct an open inquest on the five deaths in Sydney later this year.
