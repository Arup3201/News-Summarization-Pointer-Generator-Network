President Barack Obama, in a chilling assessment of international efforts to stem a deadly Ebola outbreak, said the world has not done enough to respond to a health crisis that poses a growing threat to regional and global security.

'There is still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be,' Obama said Thursday in remarks to a high-level United Nations meeting on Ebola.

The U.S. president asserted that 'if we move fast, even if imperfectly, then that could mean the difference between 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 deaths versus hundreds of thousands or even a million deaths.'

The crisis in West Africa is the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, with more than 6,200 people believed to have been sickened, almost half of whom have died.

U.S. health officials have warned that the number of infected people could explode to at least 1.4 million by mid-January, though they have also cautioned that the totals could peak well below that if efforts to control the outbreak are ramped up.

'So, this is not one where there should be a lot of wrangling and people waiting to who else is doing what,' Obama said today.

Margaret Chan, director of the World Health Organization, addressed the Ebola meeting ahead of Obama and warned that the outbreak will likely get worse before it gets better. 

The virus, she said, is 'still running ahead, jumping over everything we put in place to slow it down.'

Obama has dispatched 3,000 U.S. troops to Liberia to set up facilities and form training teams to help the Africans treat Ebola victims. 

On Thursday, top lawmakers in Congress also approved the use of leftover Afghanistan war money to begin funding Obama's $1 billion request to help fight the outbreak.

While Obama touted the progress the U.S. has made on the issue, he warned other nations that there's more to be done.

'I want us to be clear. We are not moving fast enough. We are not doing enough,' Obama said.

'Right now everybody has the best intentions, but people are not putting in the kinds of resources that are necessary to put a stop to this epidemic.' 

Obama said the U.S. would continue to lead the fight but emphasized that preventing a worldwide epidemic has to be 'a priority for everyone else,' too.

'We cannot do this alone,' the U.S. president said. 'We don't have the capacity to do all of this by ourselves.'

U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also urged world leaders to 'step up' efforts to fight Ebola.
