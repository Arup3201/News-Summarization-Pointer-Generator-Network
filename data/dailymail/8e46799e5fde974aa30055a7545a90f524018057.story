The police chief who oversaw the bungled response to last year’s Buckingham Palace break-in has been handed a plum job in charge of Prince Charles’s household.

Commander Peter Loughborough, head of royalty protection for more than ten years, is to become Master of the Household at Clarence House.

In his new role, Eton-educated Lord Loughborough, 56, who is the 7th Earl of Rosslyn, will oversee all of Charles’s domestic arrangements, from his personal dining and official entertaining to making sure his flights are booked and his suitcase packed for trips abroad.

He is taking over from Wing Commander Richard Pattle, a former royal equerry, who has been in the role since 2008 and is said to be ‘moving on to other things’.

The move is sure to spark accusations of royal cronyism, particularly as under Lord Loughborough’s watch there have been a series of headline-making royal security scandals.

The first major hiccup of his tenure came in 2003, when an intruder dressed as Osama bin Laden gate-crashed Prince William’s 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle.

The following year, a Fathers 4 Justice campaigner dressed as Batman breached security to stage a protest on a Buckingham Palace balcony. 

Former Met boss Sir John  Stevens described the security breach at the time as ‘unacceptable’. In 2009, Buckingham Palace suspended a chauffeur after undercover News of the World reporters gained access to highly sensitive areas of the building.

Two journalists, who were posing as Middle Eastern businessmen, are said to have been waved inside at a police checkpoint, without security checks, and one of them even sat in the Queen’s state Bentley car.

Arguably one of the most  serious incidents occurred last September, however, when a man was arrested on suspicion of burglary inside Buckingham Palace.

Two days later, jittery officers were forced to apologise to Prince Andrew when they challenged him at gunpoint as he took a walk in the palace gardens.

Despite these fiascos, according to Metropolitan Police insiders, Lord Loughborough is a great favourite of the Queen.

As one former very senior Met officer once said: ‘Peter speaks her language’.

A Clarence House spokesman said: ‘Commander Peter Loughborough was the successful candidate in a very large field. His credentials spoke for themselves.’

Lord Loughborough, who will be entitled to a full police pension, will earn in excess of £100,000 a year in his new role.

Details of his salary, which is paid by the Duchy of Cornwall, are not made public but his opposite number at Buckingham Palace earns £122,000 a year.
