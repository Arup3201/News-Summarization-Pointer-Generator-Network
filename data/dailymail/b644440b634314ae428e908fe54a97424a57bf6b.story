Russell Slade's position as Leyton Orient boss remains tenuous after admitting he wants to better himself, days after an approach from Cardiff City.

Slade saw his side knocked out of the Capital One Cup to Sheffield United last night thanks to Michael Higdon's early header, and if it was to be his last match in charge at The Matchroom Stadium, the goal marked a disappointing end to a four-and-a-half year project.

Cardiff's approach was rejected, but Slade admitted he is frustrated not to be in the Championship after Orient came so close in the play-offs.

He said: 'Everybody wants to better themselves, when you've been in League One a few years and came so close in May to getting ourselves in the Championship, it's frustrating.

'It's a big club, and it will be a big job for somebody.

'I love this football club. I've had four-and-a-half years, 230 odd games.'

Slade's comments after Orient's win at Scunthorpe on Saturday - that he felt 'proud' to be linked with the Cardiff job - were sure to unsettle. Sheffield United duly took advantage on the pitch.

They were given joy down the left twice in the opening two minutes, and scored at the second attempt.

Higdon's hold up play allowed Jamie Murphy free, and his perfect cross was headed past Gary Woods by the man who started the move.

Chances were sparse, but Elliot Omozusi hit the post for Orient with a deflected effort, before Stephen McGinn pulled his effort just wide at the other end.

As Sheffield United embark on another cup run, Orient are still looking for their first home win of the season.

Slade's future is uncertain, but Orient owner Franceso Bechetti's programme notes were telling, revealing he had been asked by a lawyer to allow Slade to transfer to Cardiff, a request he rejected.

Few would begrudge Slade a move up a division when his job seemed at risk a fortnight ago due to a slow start to the League One campaign.
