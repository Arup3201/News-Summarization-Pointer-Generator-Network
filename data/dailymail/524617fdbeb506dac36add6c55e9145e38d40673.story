Social media users have labelled a construction sign hanging on a metal fence outside the Melbourne Immigration Museum which read 'Keep Out' as a 'poignant coincidence'.

The museum, which documents immigration history and provides educational programs, is currently undergoing repair after damage to it's exterior and had placed metal barricades around it's main entrance with the sign.

A photo of the situation was uploaded to social media with the caption, 'It's a small museum, but it really captures the Australian spirit,' sparking a flurry of comments over the situation which was 'thick with irony'.

While one Twitter user commented that the area 'look[ed] like a jail...', another wrote 'Spoiler alert: that's the exhibit'.

'Sponsored by the Abbott government,' and 'I assumed it was the new Tony Abbott wing,' said others about the appearance of the Museum, which is located on Flinders Street in the Old Customs House.

'Well, first we'll capture you in the street and send you to wait forever in a disused art gallery in the next town,' commented one Facebook user.

'An embarrassing blight on our Country, there is zero justification for the aggressive attitude towards asylum seekers!' said another.

The sign was quickly taken down  and replaced with a sign that says 'Authorised Personnel Only

The Immigration Museum was quick to respond to social media comments, and reported that it's exterior was being attended to.

'Uh oh! A small part of the coat of arms above the main entrance to the Immigration Museum broke. We’re in the process of getting it fixed, but we are open as usual,' the Museum's official Facebook page posted.

The 'Keep Out' sign was quickly taken down by personnel from the Museum and replaced with a sign that says 'Authorised Personnel Only'.

'It is business as usual at the Immigration Museum. Two of the three entrances on Flinders St and the two side entrances are open to the public,' said a spokesperson from the Museum. 

The Museum, which was founded in 1998, hosts travelling exhibitions as well as permanent documentation of Australia's immigration history. 

'Can you fix doors? I hear the Immigration Museum may have a job opening'.
