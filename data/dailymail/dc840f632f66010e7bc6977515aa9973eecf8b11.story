Barack Obama has cut short his Christmas holiday to return to Washington as fears grow over the deadline for the ‘fiscal cliff’.

The President is expected back in the capital today as he seeks to head off the imminent crisis, leaving his wife Michelle and their two daughters behind in Hawaii.

Without a deal with Republicans in Congress on the federal budget, spending cuts and tax increases totalling £600billion will kick in on January 1 – the so-called fiscal cliff.

First lady Michelle Obama and the couple's two daughters were scheduled to remain in Hawaii - the President's native state - until January 6

The effect could send the US into 
recession, say many economists, with a global knock-on effect. 
Politicians are pessimistic an agreement will be reached in time.

Republican Senator Kay Hutchison warned any action before January 1 will
be ‘a patch, because in four days we can’t solve everything’.

Democrats
and Republicans are already preparing arguments about who is to blame 
if there is no agreement in time.

Mr Obama has scaled back ambitions for
a sweeping budget bargain. Last week, he called for a limited measure 
that extends George W Bush-era tax cuts and staves off spending cuts.

Congress is expected to return to Washington today.

First lady Michelle Obama and the couple’s two daughters were scheduled to remain in Hawaii until January 6.

In the past, the president’s end-of-the-year holiday in his native state had stretched into the new year.
