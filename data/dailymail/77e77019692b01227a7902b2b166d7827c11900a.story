With tank-transport and personal bodyguards included, a holiday company is testing the boundaries quite literally with guided tours of war-torn eastern Ukraine.

A fierce and bloody battle between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces continues, but Moscow-based Megapolis Kurort believes they can cash in on the unrest.

The self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk are on the itinerary, both rebel strongholds and witnesses to some of the worst violence.

Moscow-based Megapolis Kurort are organising tank-trips to war-torn eastern Ukraine

Customers should be aware that unsurprisingly, the trips to Ukraine are at 'their own risk'

A four-day tour of the war-torn regions will cost about £1,300 to £2,000 ($2,000-$3,000), according to the the pro-Kremlin Izvestiya newspaper.

Bodyguards will be provided from a security firm, and the tanks will hold between five and seven people.

Ten members of the travel agency have already expressed an interest in signing up for the trip, which as co-owner Anatoly Aronov added, will be attended 'at their own risk.'

'There is death and tears, there is grief, and I didn't expect such a proposal to appear at all, especially from our Moscow colleagues,' Stanislav Vinokurov, Luhansk's self-proclaimed sports and tourism minister told Izvestiya.

The tour of Ukraine will offer guests the chance to get up close and personal to scenes of battle

The trip is sure to leave memories, perhaps not so good, of the troubles in Ukraine

Officials in areas of unrest in Ukraine say the holiday company should not be profiting on 'people's grief'

'I understand and support commercial initiatives in the tourism industry, but to earn money on people's grief? I do not support this.'

The trip to war-torn Ukraine is a far cry from the holiday company's usual themed trips - they are know for organising health-orientated vacations.

Heavy artillery fire roared this morning in eastern Ukraine as fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists continued hours before a cease-fire was to take effect in the conflict that has killed more than 5,300 people.

Under an agreement reached Thursday, the warring sides are to cease firing at midnight (22:00 GMT). However, a previous cease-fire called in September failed to take hold and after fighting escalated sharply in January, expectations for the new agreement are clouded.

Officials in the port city of Mariupol meanwhile said an array of artillery attacks hit areas near the city during the morning. There was no immediate information on casualties.

Russia has flatly denied repeated Western claims that it has sent troops and equipment to the eastern Ukraine rebels.

The fighting started in April after armed separatists took control of towns and official buildings in the Dometsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine. The seizures began after Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovych was driven from power in the wake of months of protests in the capital, Kiev. 

The separatists claim the new Ukrainian authorities are fascist-inspired and aim to suppress the heavily ethnic Russian population in the east.
