North Carolina State University disbanded a fraternity chapter Wednesday following the discovery of a notebook filled with sexist and racially offensive entries in a restaurant off campus.

The punishment comes amid recent cases of bad behavior at the University of Oklahoma, Penn State and other schools put fraternities in the national spotlight.

University Chancellor Randy Woodson announced that the Tau Chapter of the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity was disbanded, effective immediately. The fraternity was ordered to immediately vacate its on-campus house. 

North Carolina State University disbanded Pi Kappa Phi after a book containing sickening jokes about rape and lynching was found by a female student at a restaurant near the school's campus in Raleigh

The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like: 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching'

Besides the lynching line, the book contained the phrase: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' 

Woodson said 'I hope today's action makes it clear that there is no place for intolerance, sexism and racism at N.C. State.

'I know the poor behaviors we've seen recently by a few in no way represent the strong character and values of our larger student body. 

'N.C. State will work hard to ensure these outlying actions never become accepted or tolerated at our university.'

Woodson's announcement comes one week after the notebook containing sexist and racist remarks attributed to Pi Kappa Phi fraternity members was found at a restaurant near campus. The book and its contents were then featured by a local television station.

A different N.C. State fraternity, Alpha Tau Omega, was suspended earlier this month after details of drug paraphernalia seized from its house surfaced in a search warrant related to a sexual assault allegation.

N.C. State responded by temporarily suspending all social events involving alcohol for more than 20 fraternities on campus.

Frat said: 'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated'

The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant

Woodson also called Wednesday for a 'thorough review' of the university's Greek system. The review will assess whether fraternities and sororities are meeting the core values and high behavioral standards of the university, and will focus on a range of issues including sexual misconduct, substance abuse, and diversity and inclusion.

Pi Kappa Phi accepted Wednesday's punishment and may be allowed to return to campus with new membership in 2018.

'We appreciate the support and collaboration with the N.C. State administration,' said Mark E. Timmes, the chief executive of Pi Kappa Phi. 'Together, we acted quickly to address this situation and reaffirm our commitment to maintaining an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued.'

Pi Kappa Phi had earlier suspended its chapter at N.C. State until the investigation concerning the green book found at a restaurant near the school's Raleigh campus was completed.

The contents of the Pi Kappa Phi notebook were first broadcast by television station WRAL. 

The notebook included sexist and racially-insensitive comments like 'If she's hot enough, she doesn't need a pulse.' and 'That tree is so perfect for a lynching.'

It also contained the comments: 'It will be short and painful, just like when I rape you' and 'I like little girls.'

The book was turned in by student Katie Perry, who said she found it while working at the restaurant.

She said: 'The contents were horrible.

'I wanted to make sure everybody knew this was going on so it could be corrected.

'Frats are looked up to, but this is what they are doing.

Pi Kappa Phi accepted Wednesday's punishment and may be allowed to return to campus with new membership in 2018 

Alpha Tau Omega's NC State chapter was suspended earlier this month amid allegations of sexual assault

'I hope other fraternities are disgusted.

'I hope that if they do have this sort of thing going on in theirs, that they'll realize, whether they want to or not, that they should change, that they shouldn't promote this kind of behavior.'

Pi Kappa Phi chief executive officer Mark Timmes earlier called the quotes 'reprehensible and unacceptable'.

He said: 'We have sent staff to Raleigh to investigate the circumstances of the situation.

'These statements are inconsistent with the values of Pi Kappa Phi and will not be tolerated.

'We are working closely with the university and have instructed our students to cooperate fully with all investigation efforts.

'We appreciate the university's collaboration in quickly addressing the situation.' 

N.C. State's alcohol ban doesn't apply to historically black Greek organizations or the Multicultural Greek Council.  

In announcing the alcohol crackdown, N.C. State said the school also plans training on diversity for chapters and other measures to increase accountability.

In the Alpha Tau Omega investigation, a woman called police March 1 to say she was sexually assaulted at the fraternity house. 

She also told officers drugs - including cocaine, ecstasy and prescription pills - were being sold out of the house.

Campus police Sgt. J.P. Dye seized drug paraphernalia, a scale and white powder in a small bag during a search of the empty house. 

Wynn Smiley, Alpha Tau Omega's national chief executive officer, said the fraternity had kicked out a pledge who had white powder and other drug paraphernalia in his room.

The student had been associated with the organization for less than a month, Smiley said.

He said the national organization conducted its own investigation with a lawyer and other alumni advisers, and the organization believes the woman was exaggerating about drugs being sold and the level of drug activity.

He also questioned her credibility on the sexual assault allegation. 

Smiley said: 'It just didn't line up with what we were finding out.'

Kayle Graham, a junior psychology major at NC State, said racism and sexism among students is sad because the younger generation's attitude indicates where the country is heading.

She said: 'It's unfortunate that at a college level, students aren't as mature and socially aware as one would like them to be.'
