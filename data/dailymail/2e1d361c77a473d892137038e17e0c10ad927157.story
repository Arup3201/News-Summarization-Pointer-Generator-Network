From the 5:2 diet to oil pulling (swishing unrefined coconut oil in your mouth for 20 minutes), with each week that passes, there's a new celebrity health craze sweeping Tinseltown.

The latest barmy way to shift pounds in Hollywood? Drinking clay.

According to Grazia magazine, Zoe Kravitz, Shailene Woodley and even health guru Elle Macpherson have been drinking the volcanic stuff.

Tried and tested: A new craze of drinking clay to lose weight is sweeping Hollywood and actress Zoe Kravitz even admitted to trying it out to slim down for her latest movie role

The celebrities are said to be fans of the method because it's highly detoxifying and rids the body of any impurities, making it ideal for weight loss and indigestion.

The clay, which the A-listers mix with water, is said to be rich in magnesium, which bonds with toxins and heavy metals in your body before flushing them all out.

It is also claimed that the quirky tipple (the celebrities opt for bentonite clay) cleanses your liver and colon and boosts your immune system.

Speaking the US Weekly, Zoe Kravitz said: 'I did a cleanse. I tried to do it the healthiest way as possible, even though it’s not healthy to do.

Are they fans too? The clay, which the A-listers mix with water, is said to be rich in magnesium, which bonds with toxins and heavy metals in your body and flushes them all out. Grazia claim that Shailene Woodley, left, and Elle Macpherson, right, have tried it out

'I ended up drinking clay because it cleans out your body and fills you up. I was eating like a Mason jar of pureed vegetables a day and running.'

While she lost 20lb to play an anorexic in The Road Within, Zoe admits it left her feeling 'awful'.

Would you dare swig it? It claimed that drinking clay cleanses your liver and colon and boosts your immune system

It's hardly surprising, as the Food Standards Agency has issued a warning about it, stating: 'We remind consumers, especially pregnant women, about the dangers of ingesting clay, clay-based detox drinks and supplements.

'The advice is being reissues after high levels of lead and arsenic were discovered in products being distributed by online retailers. Exposure to arsenic can be associated with an increased risk of lung, skin and bladder cancer.'

Speaking about the fad, Lorna Driver-Davies,  Nutritionist at the Nutri Centre, said: 'Clay for internal use (montmorillonite and betonite clay), can be used safely if it is from a company which has certified clay for human consumption.

'This is to avoid using clay that is impure (be careful as many of these exist on the market).

'Montmorillonite and bentonite clay has a molecular structure that is negatively charged, so it will attract other components (eg heavy metals) which have a positive charge. Therefore it can be used for cleansing.

'People often assume they can use the clay alone, which we do not recommend, since once the clay has done its work - you do need to make sure it is moved out of the bowel effectively to remove the waste collected within the clay.

'Therefore, use herbs such as cascara or turkey rhubarb that help to encourage a bowel movement, each day that you use clay.

'Clay should just be used for short amounts of time (one to two weeks) a few times a year, but we do not advise more unless working with a professional Naturopath.'
