Manchester United’s defensive disasters have prompted Louis van Gaal to consider using Michael Carrick as an emergency centre back.

Central midfielder Carrick is still waiting to make his first appearance for the new United manager as he recovers slowly from an ankle injury he suffered in the summer.

But the 33-year-old is now doing some training at Carrington and has already had a conversation with Van Gaal about possibly playing in the centre of defence. The Dutch coach is trying to steady the ship at the start of what is proving to be a traumatic Barclays Premier League season.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal (centre) has plenty to ponder in the coming weeks 

Carrick has filled in at the heart of defence before 

United conceded a staggering five goals as they lost at Leicester on Sunday, having previously conceded four at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup and lost at home to Swansea on the opening day of the campaign.

Van Gaal has lost Phil Jones and Jonny Evans to injury while young central defender Tyler Blackett was sent off on Sunday at Leicester.

Evans, who has a history of ankle trouble and needed surgery two years ago, is still on crutches after limping off in the first half at the King Power Stadium. The Northern Ireland defender had a scan on Monday and the initial assessment among United’s medical staff is that he will be sidelined for four weeks.

Carrick has played in the centre of the defence before during the Sir Alex Ferguson era and has the experience and intelligence to operate in that role. The fact that the former England midfielder is being considered so early in the campaign would, however, appear to provide further evidence that United erred in the summer by not buying a top-class central defender.

Carrick has told friends this week that he would rather play in the central-midfield position he enjoys but he recognises that there is increased competition in that area and is ready to fill in further back without complaint.

Meanwhile, Phil Neville, who was on the coaching staff at Old Trafford last season, says United may need to spend another £100million on players before they can compete for the Premier League title.

‘I know United have spent £150m,’ Neville, 37, told BBC Radio 5 Live. ‘I think there’s another two transfer windows of similar amounts of money needed — maybe £100m in all — before they can even think about winning the title.

‘There are still key positions in the team that need filling. I think the centre-back position is obviously the key area. Holding midfield or central midfield needs addressing,

‘They needed world-class players and there were no world-class centre backs out there. In the next two transfer windows, United might still be looking for that world-class defender.

‘I am certain Chris Smalling will come good and I have full faith in Phil Jones as well. They’ve bought a lot of foreign players, you don’t get rid of your English spine.’
