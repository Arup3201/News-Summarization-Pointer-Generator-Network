Former Chelsea and England striker Chris Sutton has been declared bankrupt after being caught in a spread betting foreign currency scam.

The 41-year-old, who began his career at Norwich City, went bust last week and blamed his problems on bad financial advice.

It was revealed last year that Sutton lost £50,000 after being mislead in a multi-million-pound fraud by his former financial adviser Simon Grint. Sutton's wife Samantha also lost the same amount.

In a statement released on Saturday night, the ex-Celtic forward said: 'During the investment period, I was led to believe that I was making a 
profit on the investment. However, I now realise that I was not.'

He also told the Daily Record: 'I’ve been given bad financial advice.'

Sutton believed he would make a 'good return' on his investment, but Grint was jailed for his role in the scheme last year.

Sutton, who won the Premier League title with Blackburn in 1995, was forced to retire from football in 2007 after suffering an eye injury while playing for Aston Villa.

The news comes just two days after former England goalkeeper David James was declared bankrupt despite earning around £20million in his career.

The 43-year-old, who now works as a pundit for BT Sport, is believed to have been stung by a costly divorce from wife Tanya in 2005.
