A £1.4billion fund to boost economic growth has given grants to just seven firms so far, it emerged  last night.

The news came as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced the second round of the Government’s Regional Growth Fund which, it is promised, will pay out £950million to 119 firms nationwide.

He said the investment would ‘jump-start growth’ and create or safeguard up to 200,000 ‘jobs that last in the places that really need it’.

David Cameron, pictured with Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard (left) and Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani (right) at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth at the weekend, has promised to kick-start major infrastructure projects and get the economy moving

But last night officials at the 
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills admitted that, six months
on from the first round of the growth fund, just seven of the 50 
companies offered a share of the original £450million pot have received 
their cash.

A steel firm in Nick Clegg’s home city was yesterday offered £36million of taxpayers’ money to expand – following a backlash against the Deputy Prime Minister over the cancellation of a previous loan.

Sheffield Forgemasters will be one of the most high-profile beneficiaries of the second round of the Government’s Regional Growth Fund, which is run by the Lib Dem leader.

The award follows a bitter row last year over the Coalition’s decision to cancel an £80million loan agreed by Labour in the run-up to the general election.

Mr Clegg, the MP for Sheffield Hallam, denied that the U-turn was an attempt to repair the political damage he has sustained in the city. While touring the firm, he was repeatedly asked whether the money was a  payment to shore up his own position.

‘This is not about any politician,’ he said. ‘It’s genuinely about what we can do together – the Government and companies like Forgemasters – to restore a sense of hope and confidence and growth to the economy.’

He insisted that the loan promised by Labour was judged to be ‘unaffordable’. Aides to Mr Clegg said he had not taken part in the decision to hand the new money to Forgemasters due to his local connections.

The firm, best known for unwittingly making parts for Saddam Hussein’s ‘supergun’ project in 1990, is a highly respected manufacturer specialising in steel forgings and castings.

The figures represent an embarrassment
for David Cameron, who yesterday said officials had been ordered to 
‘strain every sinew’ to get money for investment and infrastructure 
projects out the door.

Ministers were also facing questions 
over the allocation of the grant money, much of which has gone to 
multinationals including the U.S. car-maker General Motors, the Spanish 
bank Santander and German engineering firm Siemens.

Other businesses benefiting from state support include Bentley and Lotus.

James Ramsbotham, chief executive of 
the North East Chamber of Commerce, said the money was coming through 
too slowly – and not necessarily going to the firms that needed it most.

‘When you look at the first tranche, 
which was announced much earlier this year, until the beginning of last 
month not a penny had been paid,’ he said.

‘It is only just beginning to  filter through.

‘Very few projects are benefiting, and
we are seeing that a lot of the businesses it is going to are 
businesses that are already doing incredibly well.

‘The delays are hugely important. With
the length of time it is taking for decisions to be made and for money 
to come through it is going to be a long time yet before we see any 
benefits.’

The Prime Minister was challenged in 
the Commons over the fund last month – when the Labour leader Ed 
Miliband revealed that just two firms had received their grants.

Downing Street piled pressure on 
officials to accelerate the process, and Mr Cameron claimed last week 
that the initiative was ‘on schedule’, with ‘about 40 projects’ helped.

But the Government last night said that only seven firms’ grants had been processed.

The rest will not be handed out until the completion of ‘due diligence’.

Luxury car companies were among the businesses to benefit from the nearly £1billion of grants announced by the government today.

Bentley, based at Crewe in Cheshire, said its £3million grant would safeguard more than 200 jobs.

And another luxury car company, Lotus, based at Hethel in Norfolk, was also on the list of firms that had been successful in getting a Regional Growth Fund (RGF) grant.

Bentley said its grant would help support the development of a new engine and would also create a small number of extra jobs within the company's 900-strong engineering department.

Bentley chairman and chief executive Wolfgang Durheimer said: 'This is a real boost for Bentley. This grant will help safeguard our engineering operations as we look to develop new power trains which appeal to new markets and new customers.'

The latest grant, which follows an earlier £1.68million RGF payment, will mean Bentley is making plans to increase its graduate and apprentice intake next year.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'This is a very significant boost to local communities, and the RGF will help businesses like Bentley drive local growth.'

Mr Miliband yesterday described the 
funding as ‘too little, too late’ and pointed out that the £1.4billion 
allocated over three years was a third of the money made available 
through Labour’s Regional Development Agencies, which are being scrapped
by the Coalition.

He also accused the Government of 
undermining manufacturing by slashing capital allowances – a move which 
could see 200,000 firms lose tax breaks worth up to £30,000.

Ministers insist that the Regional 
Growth Fund has the potential to make a major impact, particularly in 
parts of the country that have struggled to attract private investment.

In addition, Mr Clegg said yesterday that every pound of the fund would be matched by at least £5 of private sector investment.

The funding announcement came as the 
Prime Minister gave the green light to two power plants – at 
Ferrybridge, in West Yorkshire, and Thorpe Marsh, in South Yorkshire – 
which will create 1,000 construction jobs.

Whitehall sources suggested that both 
announcements had been rushed forward in anticipation of today’s 
official growth statistics, which are expected to show the recovery is 
still sluggish.

Ahead of the figures’ release, Mr Cameron said that ‘strong growth alone is not the goal’.

He continued: ‘Our ambition is to 
build a new and better economy. This coalition has the determination to 
do the right thing for our country.’
