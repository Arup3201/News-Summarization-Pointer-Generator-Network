Britain is now at greater risk from terrorist attacks than any other Western nation, according to research.

The heightened threat in Northern Ireland has resulted in the UK being ranked higher than the U.S., France, Spain, China and Sri Lanka in the Terrorism Risk Index compiled by respected analysts Maplecroft.

The index, setting out which countries are considered most likely to suffer an attack, was topped by Somalia, followed by Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan and the new nation of South Sudan, with Britain in 38th place.

2. PAKISTAN - extreme

4. AFGHANISTAN - extreme

5. SOUTH SUDAN - extreme

6. YEMEN - extreme

7. Palestinian Occupied Territories - extreme

8. DR Congo - extreme

9. Central African Republic - extreme

10. Colombia - extreme

The data revealed that the number of 
world-wide terrorist attacks in 2010-11 rose by 15 per cent on the 
previous year to 11,954, although the numbers killed fell 7 per cent to 
14,478.

Researchers also found incidents of 
terrorism in Afghanistan increased by more than 50 per cent to 3,470 in 
2010-11, a trend that will concern the Nato coalition as it seeks to 
reduce troop numbers and hand over security to Afghan forces.

Britain was judged to be at ‘medium 
risk’ of an attack, and ranked above ‘low-risk’ countries including 
Spain (53rd), the U.S. (61st) and Germany (62nd).The analysts recorded 
26 terrorist attacks in the UK between April 2010 and March 2011 – all 
but one in Northern Ireland – although they did not cause any deaths.

Last year, when the results were 
calculated using a slightly different methodology, the UK was ranked 
47th, behind both the U.S. (33rd) and France (44th).

Maplecroft researchers said: ‘The UK 
continues to face terrorist threats posed by Islamist militants and 
dissident Irish republicans. The Islamist terrorist threat has both 
international and domestic elements.

‘International Islamist groups such as
Al Qaeda and, specifically, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) 
present a  continuous security risk.

‘Nevertheless, the majority of perpetrated attacks continue to be committed by dissident Irish Republican terrorists.’

Last month the UK’s Joint  Terrorism 
Analysis Centre reduced the international  terrorism threat level from 
severe to substantial.

Norway was ranked 112th in the index, 
which did not take into account the murderous attacks by right-wing 
extremist Anders Behring Breivik on July 22.
