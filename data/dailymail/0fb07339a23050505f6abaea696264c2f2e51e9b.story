The best thing about eBay is that it's a free market. Anyone can sell or buy whatever they please (within reason).

And one artist,  who goes by the name of thedoctorwhoguide2012, is using the power of eBay to sell his intriguing artwork, many of which are line drawings of EastEnders stars in rather compromising states of undress..

A rudimentary sketch of Pat Butcher with no top on has already attracted bids up to £11 - and is still going strong - while a fully-clothed version is on offer for  Buy It Now price of £5.

A drawings of Only Fools And Horses star Boycie is naif, but genuinely captures something of his character, while a sketch of Simon Cowell certainly has an element of the star's confrontational gaze.

Pulling in the bids: A near naked sketch of EastEnders star Pat Butcher, on sale for £11, has already received 16 bids, whilst a fully-clothed one (R) can be bought for £5

Talent: Drawings of David Witts, aka Joey Branning, top, and Simon Cowell, bottom, may be naif - but they capture something of the stars' character

It's not only drawings the enterprising seller - who from his profile page appears to be a young man - has up for grabs either. From a pair of used Homer Simpson socks on sale for £1.99 to an authentic pebble from Brighton beach for 
£4.99, there is something for everyone.

One
Direction fans will be pleased to know there are some uncanny sketches 
of both Louis Tomlinson and Harry Styles currently available for under £5.

But what will perhaps come as a 
surprise to the millions of One Direction fans out there is that it is not Harry Styles who is top of the pops in this arena.

Rather it is the near-naked
drawings of EastEnders star Pat Butcher that are the most popular of all. At
the time of writing, one such artwork had as many as 16 bids.

Speaking to the MailOnline, the seller said: 
'I do all my drawings myself and they make exceedingly high amounts of 
money.

'Today I withdrew £140 from sales.

Character: A sketch of Jack Branning can be bought now for £5.25, while a rather good rendition of Only Fools And Horses' Boycie that certainly captures his unique look has a Buy It Now price of just £5

That'll come in use one day: A pebble from Brighton beach is up for grabs for £4.99, but don't worry, post and packaging is free of charge

Cheesy: A second hand pair of Homer Simpson socks are on offer for £1.99

Simple: A 100-sheet pack of white copy paper is on sale for £4.25, but you might be better off popping to your local Poundland

Hygienic: A pair of fangs, clearly second-hand, can be snapped up for £3.69 on the seller's page; get your bids in before Halloween

Pristine: A pretty pink comb, that comes unpackaged, can be purchased for £2.25

Work of art: A delicate hand-painted bird picture is available for £5

One for the fans: Some line drawn pictures of Louis Tomlinson and Harry Styles from One Direction are on offer. Harry's picture already has five bids so get your bid in fast

A thing of beauty: Simon Cowell, who is known for being vain, probably wouldn't be impressed with the £4.35 sketch of him

Can you tell who it is yet? It's another EastEnder - this time old favourite Barbara Windsor in her role as Peggy Mitchell
