Violent row: Leeroy Reed leaves Bridgend Court where magistrates heard he 'used all his force' to slam his ex-girlfriend's head in a car door

Reality TV star Leeroy Reed has been spared jail after he slammed his ex-girlfriend’s head in a car door.

The Valleys star was ‘foaming at the mouth’ during a row with Rebecca Jones, 21, the court heard today.

The 23-year-old ‘used all his force’ to shut the heavy car door of his BMW as Ms Jones stuck her head inside the car as they fought over looking after their one-year-old son.

Reed also sent his former partner ‘abusive’ text messages and shouted that he hated her during an argument.

Miss Jones was a passenger in Reed’s 3-series BMW along with their baby son when they began arguing.

Miss Jones told the court in Bridgend, South Wales: ‘When we were driving, he was very angry. He was foaming at the mouth.

‘When we arrived at my house he was sitting in the driver’s seat and I leaned into the passenger seat to speak to him.

‘The door was just ajar and I put my head in, not all of me.

‘He leaned forward and pulled the door and it hit my head.

‘The door and the door frame hit my temples. I felt dizzy, in pain and I started to cry. I later noticed bruises.’

Magistrates heard how Reed had been looking after their little boy while Miss Jones went out for the day.

The court was told Reed became annoyed when she did not return at the time he had expected.

He denied assault but was found guilty at an earlier hearing after claiming self-defence.

'Foaming at the mouth': A restraining order has been imposed against Reed, who starred in reality TV show The Valleys (pictured far right with the cast), not to contact ex-girlfriend Rebecca Jones

Mel Butler, defending, said: ‘Reed’s career within the entertainment industry has been hampered - with various contracts on hold at the moment which has affected his income.

‘This appears to have been a one-off incident.’

Magistrates gave him a 12-month community order with 150 hours of unpaid work.

He was ordered to pay £630 in court costs and £50 compensation to Miss Jones.

A restraining order was also imposed against Reed not to contact Miss Jones directly or by phone and text.

Career hampered: Defending Reed, Mel Butler said that the incident had negatively affected his career in the entertainment industry. Reed said on The Valleys that he wanted to be Wales' next big urban music star

Chair of Bridgend magistrates Roger Norfolk told Reed: ‘The lesson here is violence is not the answer.’

The court heard Reed had 13 convictions for eight previous offences including two for violence.

The Valleys is a MTV reality television show in which 11 Welsh aspiring celebrities share a big house in Cardiff.

In the show, Reed said he wanted to be Wales' next big urban music star.
