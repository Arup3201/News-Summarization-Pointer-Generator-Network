A University of Washington student was stabbed six times while defending a woman who was punched in the face over a dispute involving a parking spot.

Graham Harper, 19, was leaving a house party in Seattle's University District on the morning of Jan. 25 when he saw a woman holding her face and crying, according to Kiro TV. 

Harper asked the woman what was wrong and she showed him her black eye, saying a male had just hit her.

'She seemed sad, scared and shocked,' Harper told Kiro.

Police say the assailant, another UW student Jarred Ha, and the woman got into a dispute over a parking spot and he hit her.

Harper saw Ha yelling at another woman nearby and approached the man telling him to leave.

'[I] told him you don't hit girls and I pushed him,' Harper said. 

The two got into a pushing match and, as they tussled, Ha pulled out a knife and stabbed Harper six times, Harpet alleged. 

'My entire, like, legs and abdomen were just kind of covered in blood,' Harper said, according to Kiro.

Harper spent nearly a week in the hospital and was discharged early Thursday, as indicated by a post to his Facebook page.

Due to his time in the hospital, Harper, who is in the National Guard, has been forced to take the quarter off from UW because he has fallen behind in his course work.

Police located Ha sleeping in his apartment nearby, and he reportedly showed them a knife with a 3-inch blade. 

Ha was arrested and charged with two counts of assault and is expected to appear in court this month.

Harper is being hailed as a hero because of his selfless act. 

He said he is overwhelmed by the support he received, as cards, teddy bears, and balloons from friends and loved ones filled his home.

'I was honestly astonished of how many people I knew contacted me in some form or actually came and visited me,' Harper wrote in a Facebook post. 'I definitely can attribute my quick time checked into the hospital directly to all those people.'

The UW Pike Chapter issued a statement on Instagram praising the good samaritan.

The statement reads in part: 'Sometimes, you need only to look around you to find a hero. Today, we ask for your prayers and thoughts for our brother and hero, Graham Harper, who witnessed a man assault two women, striking each of them in their faces.' 

Though doctors say Harper could have died from his injuries, the student said he would do it all again.

'I would do it all again, like preferably not get stabbed, but I would do it all again in a heartbeat,' Harper told Kiro.
