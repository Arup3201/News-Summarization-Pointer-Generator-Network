A serial killer in Indiana is boasting of his murder streak with a sickening tattoo that has left prison officials scratching their heads to figure out how the death row inmate even got inked in the first place.

The marking — 'Death Row x3' — covers most of the back of William Clyde Gibson's head, in a clear reference to the three women he's admitted to having sexually attacked and brutally killed.

William Clyde Gibson'S tattoo makes it pretty clear how he feels about his crimes. Officials, meanwhile, are still trying to figure out who let him get the tattoo, which was only pictured on July 30 because no cameras are allowed inside Indiana courtrooms

Guilty: William Clyde Gibson has been convicted in one murder and pleaded guilty to another two. In all cases, he admitted to sexually assaulting his victims, ranging in age from 35 to 75

But ever since Gibson showed up with the tattoo in court in March, officials at the Floyd County jail
and the state Department of Corrections have been 
passing the buck on who let the inmate get inked.

Gibson has been in police custody since April 2012, when he was first arrested for strangling Stephanie Kirk, 35, and Christine Whitis, 75, along with the 2002 stabbing death of Karen Hodella, 44.

'When they took him to corrections and released him over to [DOC], his head was completely shaved at that point, and no tattooing was visible at that time,' Sheriff Darrell Mills told WAVE 3.

But over on death row, the story is the exact opposite. Officials there have shifted the blame to the county jailers, saying that if he'd been tattooed while in state custody, Gibson would have been written up.

'He was held at high security risk and maximum security while in my facility,' Sheriff Mills countered.  'We know the tattooing didn't occur here.'

Last
 fall, Gibson was sentenced to death for the murder of his mother's best
 friend, Whitis, who was found mutilated inside his garage.

Then
 in March of this year, Gibson pleaded guilty to killing Karen Hodella 
and was sentenced to 65 years in prison for the crime. Hodella was 
stabbed to death in 2002, and her body was found near the Ohio River in 
Clarksville at the beginning of 2003.

Gibson is standing trial for the murder of Stephanie Kirk, whose remains were found buried in his s backyard. He's already pleaded guilty to the death, but the trial is necessary to determine if he'll be sentenced to death

He is currently standing trial for the murder of Kirk', whose remains were found buried in Gibson's backyard.

He's already pleaded guilty to the death, but the trial is necessary to determine if he'll be sentenced to death.

District Attorney Keith Henderson, who is prosecuting Gibson on the latest charges, said the tattoo could be damaging because it might make it difficult for a jury to see Gibson impartially.

'It potentially affects the prosecution of a very important case,' he told WDRB.

'And, quite frankly, I think there needs to be some sort of explanation from the Department of Corrections on how that can occur when somebody's on death row.'
