Vincent Van Gogh is renowned as one of the world's greatest-ever artists, whose work continues to inspire people almost 125 years after his death.

And now a London street - close to where he once lived and fell in love - has been renamed in 
his honour.

Residents have used its association with the Post-Impressionist to inspire the transformation of what they said was once a no-go area.

Isabel Street in Stockwell has been renamed Van Gogh Walk and the road is now filled with blue and yellow flowers in honour of his great work painting cypresses, what fields and, of course, sunflowers.

Sculptor Bill Hudson has also created a timber piece that has been installed in Van Gogh Walk.

His life and apparent suicide aged just 37 is widely known is the time he spent in London where he fell in love with his landlady's daughter.

In 1873, Van Gogh moved to London aged 20 when he was working for a firm of art dealers.

He lived at 87 Hackford Road - close to the newly created Van Gogh Walk - as a lodger and wrote of enjoying watching the bustling capital city.

In one letter he wrote: 'Things are going well for me here. I have a wonderful home and it's a great pleasure for me to observe London and the English way of life and the English themselves.'

But the artist's contented London life turned sour after he fell in love with his landlady's daughter.

Sadly for him, she did not return his affection and he left Hackford Road in 1874 following a visit from his sister Anne.

He died in 1890, aged 37, after apparently shooting himself in the head.

His association with the Stockwell has inspired locals to transform a part of it.

Elaine Kramer, who chairs the Grass Routes campaign group, toldÂ The Evening Standard that the Van Gogh Walk project 'puts our area on the map for positive reasons'.

The colours and planting have been inspired by Van Gogh's work and quotes from letters he wrote when he in the area are carved into planters.

Children have also been catered for and a basketball hoop has been installed to encourage locals to play together.

The Van Gogh Walk project wrote on its website: 'We hope that Van Gogh Walk inspires people to enjoy nature, walking, art, good company and interesting ideas - all of which van Gogh enjoyed when he lived here.'

The project, which officially opened last month, was funded by Transport for London and a local property developer.

New
traffic calming measures have been introduced, bikes are available to 
rent and a landscape garden has been built as a retreat for residents, 
many of whom do not have their own outside space.
