Olympic cycling champion Dani King has revealed she was able to ride 100km after recovering from  a training session crash which saw her sustain a collapsed lung and five broken ribs.

The 24-year-old, who was part of Great Britain's pursuit team who won gold at the London 2012 Olympics, had to spend 11 days in hospital after an accident in South Wales.

King, who posted a picture of her broken ribs, took to Twitter to say on her quick recovery: '8 weeks ago my ribs locked like this... Today I rode 100km.'

The Olympian stayed upbeat during her stay in hospital by tweeting from her sickbed in November.

She also praised nurses of the NHS hospital in Merthyr Tydfil and sent messages of support to her GB team-mates who were preparing for the first round of the Track World Cup in Guadalajara, Mexico.

‘Thank you all so much for the kind messages,’ she said. ‘They’re really helping - I’m sending massive good luck from my bed to the GB team tonight.’
