Sam Peters exclusively reveals how Stuart Lancaster's refusal to guartantee Steffon Armitage a place in his EPS was a factor in his move to Bath breaking down 

Steffon Armitage showed just what Bath and England will be missing with the try that sealed a 12th successive win in Europe for Toulon on Sunday.

Armitage’s proposed move to Bath that would have opened the door to him getting a place in England’s World Cup squad collapsed last week.

But the Toulon No 8 showed no sign of being distracted by all the speculation aas Toulon began their defence of the Champions Cup at Stade Felix Mayol

Armitage's proposed move to Bath broke down earlier in the week, and he'll remain at the French side

With nine minutes left, he scored his side’s decisive third try after being set up by a good break from Aussie Matt Gituea.

But Toulon were made to battle hard by Scarlets, who were reduced to 14 men after just six minutes when Rory Pitman saw yellow for a high tackle on wing David Smith, allowing Leigh Halfpenny to kick the home side in front.

Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland brought the visitors level with a penalty before Giteau lit the contest up with a wonderful individual try.

Halfpenny bizarrely failed to add the simple conversion after the ball fell off its tee halfway through his run-up and the Scarlets picked the ball up.

The visitors hit back with a converted try from flanker John Barclay after good work by Scott Williams and Liam Williams.

But straight from the restart Scarlets skipper Scott Williams took too long over a clearance and Maxime Mermoz charged his kick down and went under the posts, with Halfpenny adding the extras.

Wales internationals Priestland and Halfpenny exchanged penalties before the interval to give Toulon a slender 18-13 lead at the break.

Toulon put the Scarlets under pressure at the beginning of the second period but were finding it difficult to break through the visitors’ defence.

Hooker Emyr Phillips became the second Scarlets player sent to the bin for using his hands on the floor after Smith had made a dangerous break for Toulon.

But after going to touch with the penalty, Toulon lost the line-out and the Scarlets were able to clear.

Halfpenny added a long-range penalty with 15 minutes remaining to settle home nerves but they had to wait for the third try from Armitage.

With Toulon chasing the bonus point the Scarlets were able to end on a high with a Kristian Phillips try in the final minute.
