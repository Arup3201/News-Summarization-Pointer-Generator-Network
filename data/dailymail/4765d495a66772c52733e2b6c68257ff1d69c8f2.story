German supermarket chain, Aldi, has exploded across Australia with the popular brand revealing plans to open over 100 new stores across the country.

Aldi has reached 'critical mass' according to industry specialists, after making almost $4 billion in sales across over 350 stores in the last year.

Now, the supermarket giant has announced that it plans to open 70 new stores across Western Australia and 50 in South Australia, the first of which will open by 2016, according to A Current Affair.

Although posing a threat to rivals such as Woolworth and Coles, the news is being welcomed by Australian consumers and bargain hunters.

Author of Eat Well, Save More, Cath Armstrong, said she relies on Aldi to keep her monthly grocery bill at an astonishing low.

'I shop once a month and my Aldi groceries for one month for my family of five come in between $265 and $272,'Ms Armstrong told A Current Affair.

Author of Eat Well, Save More, Cath Armstrong, said that shopping at the German supermarket brand allows her to spend only $265 on groceries each month for her family of five 

'If I was to do that at Woolworths or Coles it would easily be at least 50 to 60 per cent more than that,' she said

'Cheapskates across the country are jumping up and down because Aldi is expanding… they are so excited, they can't wait.'

Part of the brand's success stems from their high quality products' competitively low prices, which are known to push down the prices across other major supermarkets; a phenomenon dubbed 'the Aldi effect'. 

Money Magazine's Effie Zahos said that Aldi's expansion 'will drive down the price point' in other major supermarkets nearby

'It will drive down the price point,' Money Magazine's Effie Zahos told A Current Affair of Aldi's expansion.

'They say you need about a 20 per cent difference in price for consumers to actually make a move - people are moving.

'They actually are very smart with where they position their stores. They buy big land, cheap land a little bit way out, and we flock to them.'
