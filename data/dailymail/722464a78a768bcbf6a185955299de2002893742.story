Ben Cowburn made a least 43 attempts to take his own life after he was persuaded to do 'sexual things' with a gay TV star, an inquest heard

A gay TV comedian has hired expensive lawyers to keep his name secret after an inquest heard claims that he ‘groomed’ a teenager for sex just months before the youth killed himself.

The comic was referred to only as ‘Mr X’ at the hearing into the death of Ben Cowburn, 18, which concluded yesterday with a jury returning an open verdict.

Speculation over who the star is is rife on the internet, but in an effort to stop his identity becoming known he has instructed one of Britain’s top libel law firms, whose partners charge around £500 an hour for their services.

His solicitors have threatened to take legal action against any newspaper that unmasks him, warning that he ‘will not hesitate to sue’.

Ben’s family are understood to be upset that they were not consulted about the coroner’s decision to keep the comedian’s name secret through an informal agreement with the lawyers involved in the inquest.

His mother Sharon, 52, said they had been ‘failed by the inquest process’ and suffered a ‘tragic injustice’ after an agonising wait of more than 1,000 days for the hearing to be held.

The comedian is alleged to have given the teenager expensive gifts and taken him to drug-fuelled parties, leaving him feeling ‘dirty and used’.

Ben met the celebrity after he moved away from his home in Cornwall, to study in London at the Fashion Retail Academy, founded by Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.

The eight-day inquest heard allegations that the comedian climbed into bed beside Ben after a late-night party featuring drugs and alcohol, later engaging him in a sex act.

At another gathering the teenager was allegedly persuaded to strip by a group of men and groped before another guest intervened and told them to stop. His twin sister Sophia, 21, said in a statement to the hearing: ‘We had concerns about him being groomed by Mr X.’

Ben was admitted to the Longreach mental health unit near Redruth, Cornwall, in October 2010 after several apparent suicide attempts. Two-and-a-half months later he was found dead in the early hours of the morning in the bathroom of his room at the hospital next to a plastic bag.

The
 teenager’s family hit out at staff at the NHS unit yesterday for 
failing to act when he disclosed that he had been sexually abused while 
he was studying in London.

The inquest highlighted ‘shortcomings’ in
 Ben’s care that contributed to him being able to kill himself, 
including poor communication and the fact that nurses were stationed a 
long way from his room.

Speaking outside the hearing in Truro, Mrs 
Cowburn condemned  failings in both the NHS’s treatment of her son and 
the inquest process.

Flanked by her husband Steve, 51, and three 
daughters, Sophia, Amber, 20, and Laura, 25, she said: ‘After an 
agonising wait of over 1,000 days, this inquest has been bitterly 
disappointing…

‘Ben’s nursing care has been referred to as 
inadequate, sub-standard and with systemic failures.  Most notably Ben 
disclosed sexual abuse he had experienced in London to four members of 
staff and no safeguarding alert was ever made by any one of those 
staff.’ 

Ben, who reportedly attempted suicide 47 times, told police 
that a TV celebrity had ‘done sexual things to him’, the inquest heard.

The
 teenager claimed that the celebrity, who was a fixture on TV and in 
magazines, had bought him gifts and taken him to ‘nice places’, and sang
 a rap song in which he said he had been ‘infiltrated’ by him. Ben said 
he had not been raped or sexually assaulted, but added he agreed to the 
sex acts ‘as he felt pressured to do the things’.

Police investigated
 the allegations that the teenager was sexually assaulted while living 
in London but detectives decided there was ‘no conclusive evidence’. 

The
 TV comedian has not been questioned, cautioned or arrested by police, 
and was not asked to give evidence to the inquest. He refused to comment
 last night. 

Dr Ellen Wilkinson, medical director of the Cornwall 
Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘The inquest was very thorough 
and every aspect of Ben’s life has been examined including, quite 
properly, the very short time he was a patient under our care.’

After the inquest, the teenager's mother, Sharon Cowburn, read a statement on behalf of her family, including husband Steve and daughters Amber, Sophia and Laura.

'Today marks the end of a torturous eight days investigating the death of our dear son Ben,' Mrs Cowburn said.

'Three years ago our entire family was devastated by the tragic and untimely loss of Ben, who in his 18 years had achieved more success, style and popularity than many.

'After an agonising wait of over 1,000 days this inquest has been bitterly disappointing, from several key members of Ben's care team who were not available for inquest and to the frustrating regularity with which NHS staff were unable to recall key events.

'Ben's nursing care has been referred to as 'inadequate', 'sub-standard' and with 'systemic failures'.

'Most notably Ben disclosed sexual abuse which he had experienced in London to four members of staff and no safeguarding alert was ever made by those four members of staff.

'What we truly, truly hope is that the trust have made the changes that they have outlined.

'It should not have cost my son's life. It's far too a higher price to pay for the NHS to address these fundamental issues.

'We remain convinced that Ben was in an inappropriate environment and staff didn't understand his individual needs as an 18-year-old boy.

'As a family this will be forever in our hearts but we have made efforts to channel our energy into positive action by setting up the Invictus Trust and we are campaigning to set up a young people's mental health unit.

'We would like to extend our thanks to the local police who have treated Ben with care and support, to the local press who have consistently publicised the work of our charity, and to the jury who have considered and questioned during this complex case.

'Ben put his faith in the system so that he could recover and be safe. However, he didn't recover and he was not safe.

'We feel that Ben was thoroughly failed by the NHS foundation trust and our family has subsequently been failed by the inquest process.'

Fighting back tears, Mrs Cowburn added: 'This is a tragic injustice.'
