A schoolboy is being taught in isolation after a headteacher ruled his neat and tidy hair cut was too short - by just 4.5 millimetres.

Smart Anthony Mousiou, 12, takes pride in his appearance with weekly trims to maintain his traditional short-back-and-sides.

But since starting school in September he has been twice internally excluded - pulled out of lessons to study alone - over the length of his hair.

Since starting school in September the 12 year-old has been twice internally excluded over the length of his hair which is under the school's minimum at the back and sides, at grade 0.5, but is much longer on top

Teachers ruled the back and sides of his trim were a grade and a half too short - a mere 4.5mm. School rules state boys' hair must be no shorter than a number two and even though Anthony's hair is much longer on top, teachers complained it was only 0.5 at the sides.

His furious father Evi, 44, has tried unsuccessfully to find him a new school and is now refusing to make his son grow his hair longer.

Electrician Evi, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, said: 'It seems like they are picking on him - I have always felt he is being picked on.

'Their website shows pictures of boys with the hair he has been banned from having. He normally has it cut every week because he likes to be groomed and keep himself nice. They cut it short and blend it up to the top.

Anthony's angry father Evi had attempted to find his son a more accepting school but was told there were no places and  Anthony was forced to return to Samuel Ryder Academy

'It's not an extreme hair cut - who sets these guidelines? Why do boys have to have hair long? Do they want everyone to be scruffy?

'It's really frustrating. He has already missed out - he keeps missing out.'

Anthony started Samuel Ryder Academy in September, and his dad insists the St Albans school initially had no problem with his hair, which is long on top and short on the sides.

But after two weeks they warned the year seven pupil his hair was too short, before making him sit lessons on his own for two days when he returned from the October half term.

Angry Evi removed his son from the school for three weeks and taught him at home while he attempted to find him a different and more accepting school.

But the council said there were no places in other secondary schools and frustrated Anthony returned to the academy, where he was once more put in isolation for a day.

Headteacher of Samuel Ryder Academy (pictured), Matthew Gauthier, has defended his rules which state students’ hair should not be any shorter then a grade two - 6mm

After keeping his son home for a few days again, dad-of-one Evi is now attempting to negotiate with the school - but they are refusing to budge on his lad's haircut.

'He went back to school on the Monday, they put him in isolation on the Tuesday and I called the school up on Wednesday but they said he couldn't go in to lessons,' said Evi.

'He can't have a normal hair cut and I can't even get him out of the school.

There is no legislation relating to pupils' uniform or appearance, which is left up to school's governing bodies to decide.

But schools often impose bans on 'extreme' haircuts or colours as part of their broader uniform policy.

The Department of Education does advise that pupils who don't comply to uniform rules can be disciplined in accordance with the school’s published behaviour policy.

A head teacher may ask a pupil to go home briefly to remedy the breach. But if the student takes longer than is strictly necessary to effect the change, then the pupil’s parents must be notified and the absence should be recorded. If a school is considering excluding a pupil in response to breaches of uniform policy then this must be in line with the legal requirements for exclusion.

'My son has said that other kids have been out into isolation too.

'He used to have his hair how he wanted it and there was no problems - he has got good reports for behaviour and everything. It's really frustrating.'

Headteacher Matthew Gauthier has defended his rules which state students’ hair should not be any shorter then a grade two - 6mm.

He said: 'We have many pupils with a short back and sides but the school rules regarding haircuts state that hair must not be shorter than a grade two.

'This information is given to parents when a child starts at the school.

'At the start of the school year when he joined us, we reminded Anthony of the school rules regarding haircuts because his hair was a 0.5 grade, much shorter than the rules allowed.

'In accordance with the school rules and his previous warning, Anthony was placed in internal exclusion for one day.

'The head of year called Anthony's father to explain the situation. Mr Mousiou decided to take Anthony out of school, rather than accept the sanction.

'Mr Mousiou kept Anthony out of school against our wishes for nearly 3 weeks.

'Like every school, we have our own set of rules, standards and expectations and it is very important that these rules are consistently applied.

'This is also the first time that we have had a parent respond in this manner.'
