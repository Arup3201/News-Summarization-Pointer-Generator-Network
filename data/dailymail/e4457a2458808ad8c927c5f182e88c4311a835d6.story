Someone was going to invent this sooner or later.

A sex simulator that provides a fully immersive 3D experience has been created in Japan.

The device was unveiled in Tokyo when the group, VR Japan, hosted a local Oculus Rift Game Jam.

A developer recently created a sex robot by combining an Oculus Rift with a controller that triggers sensations on the body, called a Novint Falcon, pictured.

Oculus Rift is an early model of a head-worn virtual reality display that is increasingly being used by developers who want to create new gaming experiences.

One developer, known only as ‘Ressentiment’, created the sex robot by combining an Oculus Rift with a controller that triggers sensations on the body, called a Novint Falcon.

The system combines an Oculus Rift - a virtual reality headset - with a controller that creates sensation on the body, called a Novint Falcon.

The Novint Falcon, a type of grip-based, haptic controller, manipulates a Tenga - a Japanese self-pleasuring device – that holds the user's penis.

The user then puts on the Oculus Rift which displays a Manga character performing sexual acts.

This isn’t the first time Oculus Rift has been used for sexual pleasure.

Earlier this year, the ‘Custom Maid 3D’ added a beta patch that enabled players to enjoy virtual reality head-mounting gaming – while controlling the action with their manhood.

The penis-powered game is thought to be the first to use Oculus Rift for sexual pleasure.

Early prototypes of Oculus Rift can be brought now but the finished version should be available next year.

Improvements are expected to include better screens, improved sensors and a greater range of motion detection.
