Champion: Sarah, who is Britain's most successful Paralympian, revealed the news on Twitter, saying she is 13 weeks pregnant

She won four gold medals at the Paralympics this summer and now cyclist Sarah Storey has another reason to celebrate – she is expecting her first baby.

The athlete and her cyclist husband Barney, a three-time Paralympic gold medal winner, announced the news on Twitter. The child is due in June.

Mrs Storey, who is shortlisted for tonight’s BBC Sports Personality of the Year award, wrote: ‘Well the exciting week we are having gets even more exciting because @BarneyStorey & I are expecting a baby in June :-)))) #happyhappyhappy’

Later she tweeted: ‘Thank you so much for all your messages, I am almost 13 weeks pregnant+have been really well, no sickness :-) #luckypair’

Mrs Storey, 35, told The Mail on Sunday that she had hoped to have a baby soon after London 2012 so that she would be able to compete at the Paralympics in Brazil in 2016.

‘We were very fortunate that it worked out the way it has and it’ll be three years before the Games in Rio so the baby will be running round and almost ready to go to school by the time it comes round,’ said the cyclist, from Disley, Cheshire.

Mrs Storey, whose total haul of 22 medals including 11 golds in cycling and swimming is the largest in British Paralympian history, added that she and her husband would wait until the birth to find out the sex of the baby.

Meanwhile, she has been careful in choosing her dress for tonight’s Sports Personality awards. She said: ‘It’s a black dress with feather details and jewels on the bust line from [designer] Malene Birger, which disguises the growing bump.’

The child will certainly have good sporting genes as Sarah claimed two golds at London's Paralympic Games while 
her husband Barney, 35, won his third gold medal riding tandem pilot with 
Paralympian Neil Fachie in the 1k time trial.

Proud Barney, 35, said they were both thrilled.

He said: 'It's fantastic. I just don't know if 2012 can get any better with the Olympics and now this.

'It's amazing news, but I can't really compare it to winning gold in the Olympics, they are two very different things.'

The couple, who married in 2007, said they will wait until the birth to find out the sex of the baby.

Barney added: 'As long as it's healthy and happy we don't care. It's very very early days in terms of Sarah's pregnancy.'

Barney said the couple plan to create a nursery at their home in Disley,
where three postboxes were painted gold in honour of their success over
the summer. 'We plan to stay in our house there, we really like living 
in Disley,' he said.

Sarah,
who was born without her left hand, is Britain's greatest ever 
Paralympian, having won 11 gold medals in swimming and cycling. She has 
an OBE and has been nominated for this year's BBC Sports Personality of 
the Year.

Barney, who is partially sighted, has three gold Paralympic medals from Beijing and London and was awarded an MBE in 2009.

Only time with tell if the newborn will follow in the tyre tracks of its now famous parents.

Barney
added: 'As for sport - I'm sure it will enjoy different spots here and 
there and we will support that but we certainly won't be pushing it into
competing in future Olympic games!'
