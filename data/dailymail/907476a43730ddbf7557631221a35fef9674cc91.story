Mauricio Pochettino's development of Luke Shaw at Southampton helped to convince fellow left-back Ben Davies to join the Argentinian when he made the move to Tottenham this summer.

An impressive 18-month spell at the Southampton helm persuaded Spurs that Pochettino was the right man to take the reins at White Hart Lane.

Pochettino last season led Saints to their best ever Premier League campaign, playing an attractive, high-pressing game with a team full of British talent whose talents he helped hone.

The likes of Adam Lallana, Calum Chambers and Shaw have moved on to pastures new as a result, with the latter leaving for Manchester United in a world-record deal for a teenager.

The left-back improved markedly during his time under Pochettino and Davies, one of the Argentinian's first signings at Tottenham, hopes his game will be taken on in a similarly impressive fashion.

'He was massive,' Davies said. 'To have an up-and-coming manager that has shown the qualities he has got, it is great to have someone like him show a lot of faith in you and that he really wants you here.

'I was delighted when I knew the interest was there and he made it easy for me after speaking to him.

'It has shown a lot of faith in me, bringing me here. I am grateful for that.

'It was an opportunity I wanted to take, really, and I am sure he is expecting me to settle into his system as quickly as possible.

'I think the way we used to play at Swansea and the way that he likes to play in keeping the ball and moving it around as quickly as possible suits my game.

'I think he could have seen that in me and hopefully I can bring that to this team.'

Pochettino's style relies heavily on his full-backs, who are expected to race down the flanks as well as be steady defensive operators.

One Saints player joked they needed two hearts to play in that manner, but Davies is loving it.

'It is sometimes (like you could do with an extra heart) at full-back when he expects you to kind of be a winger and a defender at the same time, but that is part of my game,' he said, chuckling.

'I am a pretty fit player and I enjoy that, playing under him, and it allows me to play my game.

'He has been great with all the lads and hopefully the system he wants us to play we can adapt to as quickly as possible. It'll definitely be able to pick us up results.'

Davies made his Spurs debut on Thursday night, playing the full 90 minutes as they came from behind to secure a 2-1 win at AEL Limassol in the Europa League play-offs.

It was far from an easy match, thanks in no small part to the Cypriot heat and spirited opponents, and could mean the Wales international drops to the bench against QPR on Sunday, with Danny Rose starting instead.

Having just penned a new five-year deal, the Yorkshireman looks set to be a rival for a long time to come but it is competition that Davies thrives on.

'It is going to make us both better players, hopefully, and that's all we want to do as professionals,' he said. 'It is a good competition between us and we will be supporting each other whichever way it goes, really.

'Dan has been great to me since I've come in. He has help me settle well.

'I could have easily expected to come in and have someone give me the cold shoulder, but I can't say that about him. Credit to him.

'He has been great to me and it is a competition between us. We both want that number one jersey, but whoever does get it at the end of the day we are supporting the team and we'll support each other. That's the way it is going to be.'
