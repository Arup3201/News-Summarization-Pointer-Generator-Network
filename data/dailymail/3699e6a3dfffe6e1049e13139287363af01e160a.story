An armed robber was shot dead today as he tried to rob a jewellers on the French Riviera.

In a raid which had all the hallmarks of one by the notorious Pink Panther gang, two men appeared on a scooter as ‘La Turquoise’, in the city of Nice, opened at 9am.

They rushed inside the store, which specialises in gold pieces and upmarket watches, and forced the owner to open a safe at gunpoint.

The busy street in Nice was cordoned off today after an armed robber was shot dead after a raid on a jewellers

The body of the man, said to be in his twenties, lies in the road covered by a sheet (left), while a detective bags a handgun (right). The jewellery shop owner is accused of shooting the man

After sweeping items into a bag, the men ran out and then made off on the scooter, but the owner of the shop gave chase.

‘There
 were around three shots,’ said an eye witness. ‘A young man wearing a 
helmet was hit by bullets and fell to the ground, while the other man 
sped off.

‘Stolen items were lying on the ground, next to the man who had been hit. He died very soon afterwards,’ said the source.

Police arrived within minutes of the shooting, and the jeweller – who has not been named – was arrested and taken into custody.

Other
 shop owners said the jeweller who appeared to fire the bullets with a 
handgun is around 60 years old and of previous good character.

They
 said his shop had been targeted by robbers as recently as last October,
 when stock worth around 60,000 pounds was taken, and he took security 
very seriously.

However,
 it was not clear what weapon was used in today’s shooting, with at 
least one witness suggesting that the robbers may have dropped a pistol.

A local police 
spokesman confirmed that the robber, who was aged ‘around 20’, died in 
the incident, close to Nice railway station. It is the latest in a long 
series of high profile armed robberies which have plagued France in 
recent months.

On Monday, 
armed robbers escaped with up to two million pounds worth of jewellery 
after driving a jeep through the window of an upmarket Paris boutique.

The ram-raid happened close to the prestigious Place Vendome – one of the most fashionable squares in the French capital.

In
 July, a single robber brandishing a pistol stole up to 100 million 
pounds worth of jewels from the Carlton Hotel in Cannes, a few miles 
along the coast from Nice.

Local media said the shop owner has been arrested on suspicion of murder

The
 Pink Panthers, a notoriously audacious criminal network which operates 
across the world and especially in France, is thought to have been 
behind many of the raids.

They
 are well known for arriving at jewellery stores in cars or on mopeds 
before making off, especially in glamorous cities like Nice and Paris.

In
 2008, four gang members dressed themselves up as women before breaking 
into France's Harry Winston jewellers in Paris, escaping with around 60 
million pounds worth of goods.

Interpol
 estimates that there are hundreds of members of the group, and that 
many are ex soldiers from Serbia. Many are fluent in numerous languages 
and carry false passports.
