These days you can camp anywhere from swinging in the branches to inside a disused church. But in a Russian army truck used in the Cold War, really?

Chris Armstrong, 41, has converted the back of a 12.5-tonne six-wheel drive Russian Ural-175D, into luxury accommodation that has a double bed, shower, toilet and its own kitchen with fridge.

The former Royal Marine medic fell in love with the 17-foot long nuclear proof vehicle while working in Siberia and Kazakhstan and bought one on eBay from a man in Dresden, Germany, for £6,000 in 2008.

The truck has a top speed of 50mph and a 7.2 litre V8 engine.

Chris spent almost three days and more than £1,500 on fuel in driving the Ural 375D general purpose truck back to the UK.

Chris, a bachelor, forked out thousands of pounds to convert the 90 square-foot back into living accommodation.

But after several years of happy camping he has decided to sell the truck and has put in back on eBay with a reserve price of £21,000.

Chris, from Alton, Hampshire, said: 'I was working in Siberia and Kazakhstan where I would drive them around and I really fancied having one. 

'Then in 2008 I saw one in Germany for sale on eBay, I made a bid of 7,000 euros and won.

Powerful: The unusual vehicle contains a massive seven litre petrol engine

Attention to detail: Air-conditioning controls and a bedside stereo feature in this unique camping experience

'I flew out to Dresden to get it and spent nearly three days driving it back. It cost me £350 to fill the tank up and I stopped a lot of times.'

Chris commissioned Qualiti Vehicles of Boyley, Hampshire, to transform the empty shell into top-end, luxury accommodation with all mod-cons. 

He said: 'I have taken it to loads of festivals and campsites in the New Forest and Wales. 

Chris calls the truck 'a thing of great beauty' but says it needs to be used regularly, so he' selling it on eBay 

There have been a few awkward moments when I have booked up a site in advance and then turn up in this monster truck.

'I have been refused access of some sites and even banned from others because people think it will cause damage to the land.

'I am selling it now because I'm not using it as much as I should do. It is a thing of great beauty and it needs to be used regularly. 

He's thought of everything: The truck has solar panels on the roof to provide power for the fridge and shower

Useful for festivals and campsites? For interested parties, the truck is on sale for  £21,000

'It can't really be kept on a driveway of a suburban house as it will overshadow the next door house,' says Chris

'It can't really be kept on a driveway of a suburban house as it will overshadow the next door house. I keep it on a friend's farm and whoever buys it will need a bit of outdoor space.'

The truck has solar panels on the roof to provide power for the fridge and shower. It also has self-inflating tires.
