If you thought Eddie Mair's infamous BBC interview with Boris Johnson was bruising, take a look at this.

A  live TV row between two Lebanese politicians kicked off when they started telling each other to 'eat s***'.

The angry pair even come close to blows during a row about Syria in the one-minute clip.

Trouble flared when former MP Mustafa Alloush - seen here in blue tie with bald head - branded Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a liar.

Diplomacy in action: Lebanese politicians arguing over Syria's ruler President Bashar Al-Assad

The showdown makes Boris's treatment by Mair, who called the London Mayor 'a nasty piece of work' on TV at the weekend, look positively tame.

The exchange, posted on YouTube, begins when Alloush's opponent in the studio, Fayez Shukor of the ruling Ba'ath party in Syria, tells him: 'I wish you'd listen to what President Assad said yesterday.'

Alloush responds by saying: 'I heard him, him and I don't believe him!'

Shukor hits back: 'Who the HELL are YOU not to believe Bashar al-Assad? Shame on you for saying you don't believe him.'

Alloush responds: 'I don't believe him because he is a lair.'

The pair then take part in a furious argument, heaping shame on one another and telling each other to 'eat s***', before one tells the other to 'shut the f*** up.'Â

The video is captioned as saying that the pair exchange 'further insults in Arabic'. Among them is the term 'son of a bitch', which is regarded a taboo term on TV in the Middle East.

The studio then descends into chaos as glasses and cups are smashed. The studio host then battles to separate the warring politicians while one of them appears to brandish a CHAIR.

The host shouts: 'No! No! No! Gentlemen! Gentlemen!'

The clip was first broadcast on Arabic TV two years ago but has now become a surprise hit on YouTube, notching up nearly 70,000 views after being translated.

One YouTube user posted a comment saying: 'I wish English politics were like this.. This is so amusing!'
