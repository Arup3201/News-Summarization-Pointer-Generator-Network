The DJ who made the royal prank call that led to a nurse’s suicide broke down in court yesterday as she apologised to grieving relatives.

Mel Greig, 32, said she had ‘waited so long to say sorry’ at the conclusion of the inquest into Jacintha Saldanha’s death.

The coroner ruled that the hoax, in which Greig and another DJ impersonated the Queen and Prince Charles in a call to the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was pregnant with Prince George, had been ‘pressing upon’ Mrs Saldanha’s mind when she committed suicide three days later.

Greig said in a pre-prepared statement: ‘I am so deeply sorry for your loss. I have wanted to say this to you for so long.

‘This tragedy will stay with me and serve as a constant reminder. I was always concerned for the wellbeing of the nurses and I wish I had tried harder to stop the prank call from being aired.’

She added: ‘This has been a tragic and hard time for all involved. I hope everyone here today has found the answers they so desperately needed and that the Saldanha family can continue their lives in peace without the continuing headlines.’

Speaking outside the court, Mrs Saldanha’s son Junal, 18, said: ‘My dad, my sister and I miss our beloved mum every day and will do so every day for the rest of our lives.’ 

Prank: A nurse found dead after answering a hoax call asking after the Duchess of Cambridge told her colleagues she believed the prank call made by Australian radio DJ Mel Greig (pictured today) was a genuine call from the Queen, an inquest heard yesterday

Call: Mrs Saldanha was the first nurse to answer the call by Miss Greig (pictured today) and her co-host Michael Christian, and passed them on to a second nurse on Kate's ward

Speaking after the inquest her son Junal said: 'We miss our beloved Mum everyday and will do so for the rest of our lives'

Leicester MP Keith Vaz, speaking on behalf of the family, said: ‘Over the last two days, the family and the world have heard about her nobility, her dedication to her patients, her love of her job and her fantastic professionalism.

‘It is an irony that four calls made in 115 seconds, which were the cause of so much mirth in Australia, could have deprived Benedict (her widower) of his wife and Lisha and Junal of their beloved mother.‘These despicable and cruel actions, this hoax, has changed their lives forever.’ He added that the family was taking advice over possible legal action.

Mrs Saldanha, from Southmead, Bristol, had been on the night shift at London’s King Edward VII hospital on December 4, 2012, when radio presenters Greig and Michael Christian made the call.

Believing it was genuine, she transferred it to another nurse who gave out private medical information about the Duchess, who was suffering from acute morning sickness. The call was then broadcast on Australian radio.

Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox found that four further prank calls made by the radio station were ‘almost certainly’ received by Mrs Saldanha.

She was found hanging in the hospital’s nurses’ accommodation three days later. Her internet history showed she had researched suicide prevention and suicide methods.

Dr Wilcox said that three suicide notes ‘provide evidence of an intention to take her own life’, adding: ‘The hoax call was pressing upon her mind.’

The inquest previously heard the nurse sent messages to colleagues saying: ‘It’s all my fault. I’m ready for any punishment.’ She left a suicide note addressed to hospital managers holding the DJs responsible and asking that they pay her mortgage.

Yesterday, it emerged that Mrs Saldanha’s boss did not consider the call a ‘disciplinary matter’. The coroner ruled that adequate support had been offered to Mrs Saldanha, adding that her suicide was ‘not reasonably foreseeable’.
