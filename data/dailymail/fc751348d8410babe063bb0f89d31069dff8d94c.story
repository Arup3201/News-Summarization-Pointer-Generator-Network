A narcotics squad on a drugs bust found a woman padlocked in a bedroom where they believe she may have been kept for up to ten years.

The third-floor apartment of Michael Mendez, 41, was being searched because he has strong links to the violent Latin Kings street gang.

Officers found the 44-year-old woman imprisoned at the home in Paterson, New Jersey.

A police spokesman told MailOnline that based on evidence at the scene, detectives believed that the woman had been locked in the room on and off for at least two years and potentially up to a decade.

There was a bucket in the room as a chamber pot, according to NBC New York and Mendez allowed his victim access to a TV. 

The woman, who has not been identified because she is a victim, was sometimes let out of the room when her captor was home.

There was no indication that she had been malnourished but she was currently receiving medical treatment at St Joseph's Medical Center in Paterson.

One neighbor at the brick building on Alois Place said he had known Mendez for around 12 years and that Mendez would hang out in the communal areas of the apartment complex.

The
highly organized street gang is known for prolific drug trafficking and violence.

Founded in the 1940s by Puerto Ricans, it is now mostly made up of Mexican members. There is believed to be 160 chapters in the U.S. with  20 - 35,000 members.

Many chapters have developed strong alliances with Mexican cartels to tighten their grip on the U.S. drugs market.

Primary sources of income include street dealing of cocaine, heroin and marijuana.

Gang colors are black and gold with tattoos and graffiti consisting of five or three-point crowns.

Last year, 15 gang members or associates of the Latin Kings - including two Chicago police officers - were indicted in an alleged racketeering conspiracy that resulted in 19 murders.

He said he had seen the woman a few times in the past although it was rare.

The man, who refused to give his name 
because of worries over safety, said he remembered seeing the woman get 
into a car a few times.

A maintenance worker, who also declined to give his name because of concerns over his safety, remembered the woman 'cussing me out one time when I was doing my work'.

Neighbors on either side of Mendez's top-floor apartment said they weren't aware that another person lived in the apartment.

'I didn't see any woman,' said a man who identified himself only as Buddy and opened his door only a few inches as he spoke.

'This is the first I'm hearing of it.'

Mendez, whom police said has strong gang ties, was being held at Passaic County Jail on $1million cash bail.

The
 Latin Kings is a violent street gang who have been previously been 
investigated by the FBI for drug trafficking, weapons and racketeering.

Mendez was charged with kidnapping, false imprisonment and other counts related to drugs.

State
 police said they found 4,200 prescription pills valued at $100,000, 190
 grams of marijuana valued at nearly $2,000 and nearly $23,000 in cash 
inside his apartment.

According to court records, Mendez has two prior convictions for aggravated assault, one of which carried a three-month jail term.
