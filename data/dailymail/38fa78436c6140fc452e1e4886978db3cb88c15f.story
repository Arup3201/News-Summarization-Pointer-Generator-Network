A stunning Victorian mansion that inspired Edward Hopper's famous painting 'Pretty Penny' is on sale for a whopping $4.9million (£3.2m).

The huge detached house in  Nyack, New York, boasts six bedrooms and eight bathrooms over three floors.

It has previously been owned by 1950s film star Helen Hayes and talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell.

The stunning Victorian mansion (above), which inspired Edward Hopper's famous painting 'Pretty Penny', is on  sale for a whopping $4.9million (£3.2m) in Nyack, New York

Renowned realist artist Hopper painted the house in 1939 at the invitation of 1950s film star Helen Hayes and her husband Charles McArthur

Renowned realist artist Hopper painted the house in 1939 at the invitation of Mrs Hayes and her husband Charles McArthur.

The 157-year-old house, which has been on sale since December 17, also has a swimming pool and stunning views of the Hudson River.

Its large grounds boast the biggest collection of conifers in north-east USA, which are valued at $500,000 (£322,248).

And two large bas-relief icons of theatre, 'Comedy' and 'Tragedy', flank one of the doorways.

Built in 1858, the house has played host to Marilyn Monroe, Katharine Hepburn, Vivian Leigh, John Barrymore, Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles - thanks to its glamorous Hollywood owners.

Mr McArthur allegedly named the house 'Pretty Penny' after Hopper painted it 'because that's what it cost'.

The huge detached house, which is meticulously decorated with pale colours and bright patterned rugs, boasts six bedrooms and eight bathrooms over three floors

One of the mansion's main reception rooms shows the beauty of the building, with its high ceilings, immaculate detailing and beautiful wooden floor 

An exquisite gold and diamond chandelier hangs over a mahogany table in one of the Victorian property's many rooms designed to entertain

The house includes a second bright living room with two plush armchairs, a high wooden coffee table and a  widescreen TV on the wall

The 157-year-old house, which has been on sale since December 17, also has a swimming pool, which is protected by plush green banks and has a small white summer house nearby 

The property has eight bathrooms, one of which is decorated with pale engraved furniture, marble tops and a large white bath

The kitchen is one of the only rooms in the mansion that has several modern features included. A state-of-the-art oven and huge metallic fridge are two of the prominent focal points in the open-plan room

The house was built in 1858 and its spacious hallways, which have marble floors, have played host to Marilyn Monroe, Katharine Hepburn, Vivian Leigh, John Barrymore, Laurence Olivier and Orson Welles 

Hopper almost refused to paint the portrait, despite the house being on the same street as his boyhood home.

But when confronted with the considerable fame of the owners and a generous $2,500 (£1,611) fee, Hopper was convinced by his wife Jo and agent Frank Rehn to take the job.

Although Mrs Hayes and Mr McArthur requested he add in their daughter Mary and her pet poodle Camille, Hopper refused and handed over the completed work just before Christmas.

It was the last commission he ever took. 

A spokesman for LuxuryEstate.com, where potential buyers can find more details, said: 'Pretty Penny has been retrofitted for the twenty-first century, but its warmth, character and historic past are prevalent today, as it was years before, unlike any other home in the Hudson Valley.

'It is truly an extraordinary home for an extraordinary person.'   

Helen Hayes (left with daughter Margaret in 1948; right in My Son John in 1951) lived at 'Pretty Penny' until her death in 1993. Her husband Mr McArthur allegedly named the house after Hopper painted it 'because that's what it cost'

The property has six bedrooms, including this master suite which faces the Hudson River and is decorated with silk gold curtains

Other bedrooms have unique features including this grey and black fireplace and four-poster wooden bed

One of the other bedrooms, perhaps suitable for a child, also has breathtaking views over the river and features a cute blue bed that perfectly fits into the corner

Terracotta walls and bright patterned curtains frame the view out of this double room. It also has a discrete storage area behind the white doors to the left

A spokesman for LuxuryEstate.com, where potential buyers can find more details, said: 'Pretty Penny has been retrofitted for the twenty-first century, but its warmth, character and historic past are prevalent today.' A third reception room is pictured above, which also features the spectacular wooden floor that runs through the rest of the house

High ceilings lead the eye up the cream walls to 12 unusual glass windows, which feature unique octagonal patterns 

An elabourate white cornice is featured in rooms throughout the three-storey mansion and consists of delicate patterns and hand-crafted sculptures

Two large bas-relief icons of theatre, 'Comedy' and 'Tragedy', flank one of the doorways leading outside. The 'Comedy' icon (above) includes two theatre masks, a wreath and a joker face

Prospective buyers might be persuaded by the long white balcony, which looks like the perfect place to read a book or entertain friends on a summer evening

The garden has several large flower beds featuring tall trees and small bushes, which thrive in the rich soil on the bank of the Hudson River
