A frisky Florida couple got in legal trouble when drivers saw them having sex in a car while cruising down a state highway.

The incident escalated when the couple realized that the neighboring car saw them mid-coitus, proceeded to tail their spectators, and then approached them while holding a gun.

Suzanne Welker, 31, was allegedly performing oral sex on Ernest Gonzales, 27, while he was behind the wheel of his SUV and driving down I-95 on Sunday afternoon.

Louis Carr was also driving on the busy highway with his girlfriend and 3-year-old son when they spotted Welker and Gonzales in the compromising position.

'I point to my old lady, (Welker) looked across me about that time, she jumped up in the seat bare butt, mooned us through the window,' Mr Carr told WJX-TV.

Mr Carr and his girlfriend, Kristin Broughman, continued to watch the couple and then Gonzales saw that they had spectators.

He proceeded to follow Mr Carr as he drove to his parent's bar called the Redneck Country Club in Yulee, a suburb of Jacksonville.

Security footage from the bar shows that Gonzales almost runs Mr Carr off the road as he follows him into the parking lot.

'We didn't think they were going to pull all the way in because they stopped at the gate, and then I guess they decided they were still going to come in. And they came all the way in. That's when the cops were called and everything went crazy,' Ms Broughman told WJX-TV.

At that point, Welker and Gonzales got out of their car and approached Mr Carr's vehicle. He could see that Welker was holding a semiautomatic handgun.

Though there was some confusion when the two couples spoke in the parking lot, Ms Broughman says that Welker thought that they had taken pictures of the couple in the act, which they did not.

Welker and Gonzales left the parking lot after a bar employee told Welker that the establishment did not allow guns. They were later arrested at their Fernandina Beach home.

UPI reports that the Nassau County Sheriff's report says that Welker was 'naked and could be seen clearly by everyone in the area'.

The Florida Times-Union reports that they were both charged with indecent exposure and aggravated assault.

'They should do that stuff behind closed doors,' Mr Carr said.

'It had clear glass windows, what do you expect? There's a place and time for that, and it's not driving down the interstate doing 70.'

This incident comes just days after another Florida motorist was arrested for attempting to rob a man at gunpoint while she was having sex with him as he was behind the wheel.
