The ex-wife of a Los Angeles publishing heir will be getting just $2,000 a month in spousal support, despite living for 20 years in the lap of luxury, that included multimillion-dollar homes, private jets and purchases of art, designer jewelry and fine wine.

Before their marriage ended, Frederick and Mary Kate Williamson were spending up to $50,000 a month living in and renovating a $2.75million estate outside Santa Barbara, California.Â 

Neither Mr or Mrs Williamson were working, but were living off gifts - including a one-time lump sum of $900,000 - given to Mr Williamson by his parents, Courthouse News Service reports.

Mr Williamson's great-grandfather was Harry Chandler, the second publisher of the Los Angeles Times and a Los Angeles real estate mogul.

Split: Frederick and Mary Kate Williamson, age 51 and 50, had access to seemingly unlimited funds for the 20 years they were married. When they split, the spigot dried up and Mrs Williamson was left receiving $2,000 a month in support payments

The couple's second home was on the grounds of the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena and included full access to the property's swimming pool, spas and gyms

However, when the marriage ended in 2006, Mrs Williamson found that the spigot had been shut off.

Mr Williamson's parents who had generously given 'loans' and 'advances' on his inheritance, now said he was all but cut off.

A judge, therefore, ruled that the only income Mrs Williamson was entitled to was $99,000 a year a made from his trust fund and working as a classified sales manager for the Santa Barbara News Press.

Based on that figure, she was granted spousal support of $2,000 a month - less than a tenth of the $26,000 she requested, according to court documents.

Mrs Williamson appealed. She protested that Mr Williamson's potential assets and income was much higher.

'Everybody in the family just gets money when they need it,' she wrote.

Starter home: The couple bought this estate on the Ritz Carlton grounds for $900,000 and sold it years later for nearly $3.5million

Mrs Williamson, a former Ann Taylor sales clerk who never finished college, met and married Mr Williamson in 1986. They had three children, all of whom are now over 18.

In court documents, she listed a long history of Mr Williamson's parents giving the couple money for homes and other expenses.

Each year, the family received $130,000 in 'gifts' from his parents - $26,000 each for Mr and Mrs Williamson and their three children.

In 1991, Mr Williamson's father 'loaned' his son $395,000 to buy their first home. The loan was later forgiven. A few years later, the family received $1.2million to buy and renovate the historic Harton Hall home on the grounds of the Ritz Carlton Huntington Hotel.

The purchase of the $900,000, 7,000-square-foot home gave them access to the grounds of the Ritz Carlton and its pools, gym, tennis courts and spas. The couple also had a full-time housekeeper.

The last home was a a 2.2-acre estate in Santa Barbara that cost $2.75million and millions more to renovate. In the end, the couple sold it for a massive loss when they divorced

Furthermore, account to court documents: 'Frederick and Mary Kate drove luxury automobiles and had a full-time housekeeper. They belonged to several exclusive private clubs, including The California Club, The Valley Hunt Club and The Pasadena Athletic Club.

'They traveled frequently, both internationally and domestically, sometimes by private jet. During ski season, the family spent most weekends at Mammoth Mountain. Mary Kate shopped at high-end stores, purchasing designer jewelry, clothes, handbags and shoes. Frederick collected fine wine.'

Then, in 2003, the couple sold their home for $3.4million and purchased a $575,000 ski lodge in Mammoth, Colorado, as well as $2.75million, 2.2-acre estate in a private community in Santa Barbara.

Mr Williamson received a $340,000 advance for that transaction, as well.

The couple then undertook a lengthy renovation of the new property. Mr Williamson quit his $120,000-a-year job at the Los Angeles Times to work on the renovation fulltime, court documents say.

During this time, the court had no income from jobs but were spending $45,000 to $50,000 a month.

Last week a state appeals court upheld nearly all of the lower court's ruling after the bitter divorce - including the $2,000 a month payment.

Judges found that no matter how wealthy Mr Williamson's parents were or how willing to give him money they were, they could not be forced to pay for his ex-wife's support.
