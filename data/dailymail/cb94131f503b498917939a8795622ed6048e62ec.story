A Missouri highway was shut down Monday morning after authorities discovered an effigy of President Obama handing from an overpass.

Interstate 70 was closed down briefly while a bomb squad investigated because sheriff's deputies saw a suspicious device attached to the mannequin, which was adorned with an Obama mask, said Sergeant Ronda Montgomery of the Jackson County Sheriff's Office.

No explosives were found on the mannequin, which was discovered on a bridge about 25 miles east of Kansas City.

Effigy: A mannequin wearing an Obama mask was found hanging from this overpass over Interstate 70 in Missouri outside Kansas City. Authorities shut down the interstate briefly before determining that the mannequin contained no explosives

The mannequin was reported to the authorities around daybreak and it is unclear how long it had been hanging from the structure, she said.

A rope was used to string up the mannequin but authorities were not releasing specific details, Montgomery said, adding that the incident was still under investigation.

'We are trying to put pieces of the puzzle together, but it's early,' Montgomery said.
