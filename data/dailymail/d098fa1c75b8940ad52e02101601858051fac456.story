You can forgive the Faroe Islands for going all-out with their celebrations following their shock 1-0 win over Greece in the Euro 2016 qualifier on Friday night. 

The tiny footballing nation recorded just their 20th win since beginning international play in 1988 following a hard-fought victory against the Greeks. 

Joan Edmundsson's 61st minute goal gave the Faroe Islands the win, their first in competitive action since 2011... so a celebration was certainly in order.

The victory will surely go down as one of the greatest for the 187th-world ranked minnows, and judging by their post match changing room celebrations they'll be thriving off this one for a while to come.  

With the match out of the way the players returned to the dressing room, chanting and singing at the top of their lungs.
