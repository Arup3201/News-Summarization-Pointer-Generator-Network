A schoolgirl was stunned when one of her milk teeth fell out - with a smiley face on it.

The underside of ten-year-old Trina Hutchinson's molar has three clear indents that make it look like a happy face.

And Trina was all smiles after the Tooth Fairy gave her £2 - twice the amount she normally gets.

Trina Hutchinson's mother Sue Male said she was 'stunned' to discover a smiley face on the underside of her 10-year-old daughter's molar tooth after it fell out

Toothy grin: The three indents in the underside of the molar give the impression the tooth has a smiley face

The Year 5 pupil said: ‘I don't really believe in the tooth fairy, but I still put it under my pillow just in case.

‘I got £2 for it, which is twice what I normally get - it was good,' she said.

Trina's mother Sue Male, 38, from Kingswinford, West Midlands, said she has never seen anything like it.

The mother-of-five added: ‘Trina had to stop eating a chocolate bar, because her tooth was too wobbly. She prodded around a bit and pretty soon it fell out.

‘When she went to wash up, I took her tooth and was shocked to discover the smiley face on it.

‘It's hilarious, I was like 'Oh my life', and Trina was stunned too.’

Housewife Ms Male added: ‘Trina is such a smiler that even her teeth are happy.’
