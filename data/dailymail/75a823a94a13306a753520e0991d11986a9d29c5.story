Police have had another breakthrough in the cold case of a triple murder after finding a buried container on a property connected to the 1974 deaths of Barbara McCulkin and her two daughters.

On Saturday morning, detectives from the Warwick Criminal Investigation Branch, Homicide Cold Case Unit and State Drug and Serious Crime Illicit Laboratories Investigation Team (ILIT) used an excavator to unearth a buried shipping container on the Massie property - north-west of Warwick in Queensland.

The container with a concealed hatch was located and ILIT members used breathing apparatus to examine the contents found inside for more evidence of drug trafficking.

Queensland police have unearthed a shipping container on a property connected to the 1974 murders of Barbara McCulkin and her daughters

Inside the container - which is believed to have been there for a number of years - police found what looks to be containers filled with bags of unknown objects

This is the second time the property has been search and belongs to 66-year-old Thomas Martin, who was charged with drug trafficking and weapons offences last week

Queensland police believe the container had been buried at the Massie property, near Warwick, on Willowvale Road for a number of years.

Detective Inspector Mick Dowie said further information from the public had resulted in the find.

'As a result of fresh information received from the public we have returned to the property to inspect a suspicious site and located a buried shipping container,' he said.

'For the safety of investigators we have called upon the assistance of ILIT members to process the contents of the container. We are still assessing the contents.'Investigations are ongoing and there is no further information available at this time.

The property belongs Thomas 'Teddy' Martin who was granted bail in Toowoomba Magistrates Court on Friday after he was arrested for drug trafficking and weapons offences, according to the ABC.

Last week, police remove drums filled with drugs from the property in Warwick, allegedly run as an alpaca farm by Vincent O'Dempsey as a front for a marijuana operation

This is the second time the 66-year-old's property was raided by police.

This comes after police seized seized drums full of shrink-wrapped bags of cannabis and $300,000 in cash from another property near Warwick last week.

Drugs and cash have been seized from a property owned by gangster Vincent O'Dempsey, who had not been seen for days

It was reportedly run as an alpaca farm by known criminal Vincent O'Dempsey.

O'Dempsey, who was named as a ‘person of interest’ in the 1974 murders of Barbara McCulkin and her two daughters has not been seen for days, The Courier Mail reported.

Police are investigating whether there is a link between O’Dempsey and the 66- year-old man who is expected to appear at Toowoomba Magistrates Court on Thursday.

The whereabouts of O’Dempsey’s associate Gary ‘Shorty’ Dubois, another person of interest in the murder investigation, are also unknown.

Both men, for whom police have not issued arrest warrants, were charged with the murders in 1980 following a coronial inquest but the case collapsed due to a lack of evidence.

The day before Wednesday's drug raid, homicide detectives found evidence in at two properties linked to O’Dempsey - including his Exquisite Alpacas breeding operation. A jar containing financial records was also discovered.

In 1974, during the summer school holidays, Barbara McCulkin, 43, was at home in Highgate Hill, Brisbane, with her daughters Vicky, 13, and 11-year-old Leanne.

The two girls had been at a birthday party and returned home as their mother was doing her chores. At some point two men visited the house and were seen by one of the girl's friends.

O`Dempsey, who is a key 'person of interest' in the 1974 murders of Barbara McCulkin and her daughters and lives nearby the property, is believed to have gone underground

Barbara, Vicky and Leanne McCulkin vanished and no trace of their bodies has ever been found.

Despite several police investigations, a coronial inquest and the charges being laid against O'Dempsey and Dubois the three murders have remained unsolved and have become one of the most notorious killings in Australian history.

Forty years on, police are confident they are closer to an arrest, as well as focussed on the potential motives for the murders.

The first motive relates to sexual assault of the two young McCulkin girls, and that Barbara McCulkin was willing to exchange information about a criminal gang.

The second motive is that Ms McCulkin was murdered because she knew too much about one of Australia's most notorious crimes - the firebombing mass murder at the Whiskey au Go Go nightclub on Brisbane's sleazy city strip, known as 'The Valley'.

Did she know too much? Brisbane housewife Barbara McCulkin and her daughters Leanne (left) and Vicky (right) vanished from their Highgate Hill home in inner Brisbane on January 16, 1974 and have never been seen again. Last week, police searched two properties 150km away at Warwick, south-west of Brisbane, and are confident they have some clues to the abduction and murder of the three which are connected with the underworld

Criminal connections; Barbara McCulkin, pictured with 13-year-old daughter Vicky, was the estranged wife of a debt collector, Billy McCulkin, who had criminal connections. But the 34-year-old housewife was also described as a devoted mother-of-two who enjoyed making ballet costumes for her girls

Sinister clue: the firebombing mass murder of the Whiskey Au Go Go nightclub the year prior to the McCulkins' abduction and murder might hold clues to their fate. Barbara McCulkin might have been willing to provide detectives with the names of a criminal syndicate with connections to the fire which broke out on March 8, 1973, when two 43- gallon drums of diesel were thrown into the foyer, lit, and 15 people died of asphyxiation

Forty years after Barbara McCulkin (above, left) vanished along with her two daughters, Vicky, 13, and 11-year-old Leanne (above, right), her family requested police look into the abduction-murder case. Now police believe they have clues lead to the potential arrest of suspects in the case, which has sexual abuse motives, police say

The firebombing which tore apart inner Brisbane in the early hours of March 8, 1973, occurred after drums of diesel were thrown into the Whiskey Au Go Go nightclub and lit, patrons prevented from fleeing after someone had greased the fire exits. An ABC TV reporter (pictured, left) reports on the devastating after math, which saw 15 people asphyxiated. Now detectives say the abduction and murder of 13-year-old Vicky McCulkin (above right), her younger sister and her mother may be connected with the case

Ms McCulkin was the estranged wife of Jimmy McCulkin, a debt collector with underworld connections.

The previous year, on March 8, 1973, two 43- gallon drums of diesel were thrown into the Whiskey au Go Go foyer and lit. The fire escapes were covered in grease, preventing the nightclubbers from escaping.

Questions are still being asked to this day about who else may have been behind the fatal firebombing of the Whiskey Au Go Go nightclub, for which two men, James Finch, 29, and John Stuart, 33 were convicted. Brisbane housewife Barbara McCulkin may have been willing to give police information over a criminal gang connected with the atrocity before she and her daughters were abducted

Fifteen people died in the fire, three of them musicians who were performing at the club. Two men, James Richard Finch, 29, and John Andrew Stuart, 33, were convicted of arson and murder as part of an extortion campaign.

But rumours continued to swirl over who else was involved in the mass murder plot.

The case foundered for lack of evidence, but in January this year, at the request of Ms McCulkins' family on the 40th anniversary of the murders, police commenced a full review of the case with a new focus on the motive for the suspected murders.

Investigators joined with the Crime and Corruption Commission to pursue significant new evidence in four states.

'Detectives have interviewed potential witnesses across Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria and have uncovered compelling new evidence surrounding events that took place on the day of their disappearance and subsequent murders,' Detective Superintendent Steve Holahan of the Homicide Group said.

'Based on the evidence collected, we now believe we have identified several motives for their murders. Barbara McCulkin may have had knowledge about serious crimes and the young McCulkin girls may have been sexually assaulted.'

A $250,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the murderers has been  offered, as well as an indemnity from prosecution for anyone who supplies information that leads to a conviction.
