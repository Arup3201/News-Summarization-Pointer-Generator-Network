It's the capital of Australia, so it seems fitting that the locals are earning a good wage.

According to new figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, workers in the ACT are getting paid the highest in Australia.

Data revealed an average weekly full time wage for a Canberran is $1663, just $20 ahead of workers in Western Australia, while pocketing over $200 than workers in New South Wales. But it has been revealed men in Western Australia do earn more than men in Canberra due to the resources boom.

Canberrans are the highest paid workers in Australia. On average they are paid $1663 a week, $20 more than their Western Australia counterparts.

Wages in the ACT have dropped slightly from last year. In November, 2013 the average was $1,671, again trumphing Western Australia (which had a jump of $21 to their wages in 2014 compared to last year).

Spokesperson from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) says it's no surprise wages are inflated in the ACT.

'There's a higher proportion in the public sector that are paid more than their counterparts in the private sector.'

On average those in the public sector earn $133 more a week than those in the private sector.

Western Australia  (Perth CBD left) has ranked second on the highest paid wages in Australia while New South Wales (Sydney Harbour Bridge right) is coming in at third.

Not good news for those across the strait,  on average Tasmanians are earning the lowest weekly wage in Australia on $1247. South Australians are next on the lowest paid list, earning about $1359 a week, while Victorians are on about $1380 a week.

Five of the eight states are getting paid below the national weekly average at $1454, (which is an increase of nearly 2.5% on the same time last year).

Workers in NSW are the closest to earning the national average.

The mining industry remains the highest paid sector in Australia. On average miners get paid nearly $2500 week.

Canberra, ACT has the highest paid wages in the country at an average of $1663 per week.

The mining industry remains the best paid sector of the Australian economy. On average, miners can earn almost $2500 a week.

Not such good news for those in retail and accommodation and food services who are earning the least in the country at just over $1000 a week.

Teacher Claire Jacob has lived in Canberra for 19 years and says it's not surprising Canberransare being paid high wages.

'Yes I would imagine public sector workers get paid highly but people with jobs like lawyers, consultants and town planners I would also think would rate highly.'

'The public sector's good wages seem to be driving other high wages across the ACT.'

She says she believes the cost of living to be pretty high in Canberra and that might be some of the reason why wages are better.'Registration is more, rates are high and electricity has jumped three percent. I expect the wages will continue to rise with inflation, especially the wages of teachers who are demanding more.'

This data could be surprising to some people considering Darwin, Perth and Sydney are recorded to be the most expensive to live, according to Numbeo. The current cost of living is highest for the Northern territory, while Tasmania is the cheapest to live. Canberra is placed at seventh out of eight states and territories in Australia.

Overall Australia is the 6th most expensive place to live across the globe.
