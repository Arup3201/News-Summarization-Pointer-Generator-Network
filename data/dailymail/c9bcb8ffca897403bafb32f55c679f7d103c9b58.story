The leader of terror group Boko Haram has threatened more massacres and war on neighbouring countries in a new rant-filled video.

Abubakar Shekau says that the recent mass killings in Nigeria by the group, were just the tip of the iceberg and that more deaths are coming.

He also threatened war against Niger, Cameroon and Chad for having sympathy with France in the wake of the Paris terror attacks on the satirical French magazine and also burns the Nigerian flag.

Shekau, flanked by two men covering their faces and holding weapons, also threatened war against Niger, Cameroon and Chad 

It comes after as many as 2,500 civilians were killed and 3,700 homes and business were destroyed by an attack by Boko Haram on the towns of Baga and Doro Baga near Nigeria's border with Cameroon earlier this month.

The attack sparked international outrage not seen since the militants kidnapped nearly 300 girls from a boarding school in the country last April.

In the footage, which had been posted to Youtube, Shekau can be seen wearing a camouflage coat and reading from a script flanked by two men covering their faces holding weapons.

He then explains that the group takes responsibility for the mass killings in the Baga before taunting the leaders of Niger, Cameroon and Chad.

The footage end with Shekau burning the Nigerian flag and taunting the country's president Goodluck Jonathan 

Shekau says: 'Muhammed Yusuf, the president of Niger, so you too have the temerity of coming out to pay sympathy visit to Francois Holland the President of France.

'Is this your true character? Muhammed Yusuf, you have amazed us. You shall soon see our wrath, very soon.

'And you, Paul Biya, the president of Cameroon. Now you are asking for foreign assistance; please don’t waste your time because God is more than all the help you will get.

'And even you Idris Debby, you are not spared. You guys have acted too late, very late.'

Earlier this month, Boko Haram carried out a massacre in the towns of Baga and Dogo Baga killing 2,000 people and destroying 3,700 buildings  

He also turns his attentions to Nigeria and taunts their president Goodluck Jonathan.

Shekau adds: 'Jonathan you are in trouble. All governors of Nigeria are in trouble. All these war equipment that you see being displayed in the screen are gotten from Baga and Doro.

'Your army kept deceiving the world that you can’t fight us because you have no arms. Liars! You have all that it takes; you are just coward soldiers.

'You forgot that it is God that arms. Is it not amazing that we, who started with sticks and machetes, are today the biggest headache to the almighty Nigerian soldiers? What a shame.'

'This is just the beginning of the killings; what you've just witnessed is a tip of the iceberg; more deaths are coming.

'This will mark the end of politics and democracy in Nigeria. This is to confirm to you that we carried out the Baga massacre, and we are going to do more.'

The video comes after a top security advisor to President Jonathan told an audience in London yesterday that the Nigerian army had 'a lot of cowards'.

Critics have said that the Nigerian army are under-equipped to deal with Boko Haram fighters and that is why the town of Baga has fallen under militant control.

But Sambo Dasuki said: 'Unfortunately we have a lot of cowards. We have people who use every excuse in this world not to fight.

But he added that reinforcements had been sent in to retake Baga, something he hoped would be completed soon.
