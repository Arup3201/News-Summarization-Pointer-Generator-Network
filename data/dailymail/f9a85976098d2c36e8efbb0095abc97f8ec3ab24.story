Aston Villa have now gone eight hours and 42 minutes of football without scoring after losing 2-0 against Liverpool at home, with Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert getting the goals.

Boos rang around Villa Park as they yet again gave the home fans little to cheer about.

Here, DOMINIC KING gives his ratings from the Barclays Premier League match.  

ASTON VILLA (4-3-3) 

Brad Guzan – Stood firm when Sterling went clean through and made an excellent fingertip save in second half when the Italian threatened – 7.5

Alan Hutton – Aggressive and tried to push Villa forward; no blame could be attached to him for either goal conceded – 6.5

Jores Okore – Did well in the first half and, like Baker, couldn’t be named as the reason Villa ended up floundering – 6

Nathan Baker – Commanding display when the sides met at Anfield; not so impressive here but not the worst by any means – 6

Aly Cissokho – Didn’t give Liverpool any reason to regret not making his loan move permanent; anonymous for most of the match – 5

Ashley Westwood – Normally assured and steady and keeps the ball ticking over but nothing of the sort here and was hauled off – 5

Carlos Sanchez – Pick of Villa’s midfield, bright and energetic. Could have done with a few more performing like that around him – 7

Fabian Delph – At the heart of Villa’s best moments in the second half but costly error when caught in possession gave Liverpool their second goal – 6.5

Tom Cleverley – Had no impact at all; cheers from The Holte End when Lambert finally took the wise decision and substituted him – 4

Gabby Agbonlahor – Lots of running up and down the field and ran around the ball a lot but hardly touched it. No shots at goal – 4

Christian Benteke – Threatened to come to life in the second period but impact fizzled out after a shot was saved by Mignolet – 6

Former Manchester United player Tom Cleverley's substitution after 59 minutes drew cheers from the fans

SUBS

UNUSED

Given (GK), Bacuna, Richardson, N’Zogbia, Lowton

MANAGER

Paul Lambert – Tried to shake things up in the second half but you get the feeling he is working with one hand behind his back – 6 

New signing Carles Gil came on in the second half after 59 minutes to make his debut for Villa

LIVERPOOL (3-4-3) 

Simon Mignolet – Struggled with ball at his feet, misjudged crosses and made some fine saves; his season in 90 minutes – 7.5

Emre Can – This new system has enabled Rodgers to shoehorn the German into his team; not always foot sure but is improving – 8

Martin Skrtel – Pick of Liverpool’s defence, his efforts summed up by one sliding tackle to deny Benteke in the second half – 7.5

Mamadou Sakho – Looks more settled now in this team; his gait may be awkward but he did exactly what was expected of him – 6.5

Lazar Markovic – Not as impressive as he was last week at Sunderland but bright in possession, covered the hard yards and sensible in possession – 6.5

Jordan Henderson – Found his stride in recent weeks; usual enthusiasm and prodigious work rate, his ball for Borini’s goal was magnificent – 8

Lucas Leiva – Rodgers rightly quelled talk of him joining Inter Milan this week; is playing too important a role at the moment – 7.5

Raheem Sterling misses a good chance to make it 2-0 to Liverpool against Aston Villa on Saturday

Alberto Moreno – Playing wing-back suits this attack-minded defender. Unlucky to have a goal chalked off before half-time – 6.5

Fabio Borini – His running gave Liverpool purpose and he took his goal well but there were other moments that left something to be desired – 7

Raheem Sterling – Back from a mid-season holiday; fluffed a glorious chance to kill the game with a lazy finish straight at Guzan – 6.5

Philippe Coutinho – Another who is getting better; big impact and some moments, particularly in first half, were of highest quality – 8.5

MANAGER

Brendan Rodgers – When Liverpool need to change things in the second half, he did so decisively. Introduction of Lambert key – 7.5
