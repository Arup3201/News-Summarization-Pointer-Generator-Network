More Australian men will now have access to one of the world's most revolutionary drugs, Viagra, with its price per-pill plummeting to less than the cost of a cup of coffee.

At full-cost, consumers were being slugged $85 for the Pfizer-owned product, but since the medical giant's patent expired in mid-May it has opened up a new market for generic brands to swoop.

The gap in the market is proving a huge winner for consumers and now more men can pay to turn their troubled sex life around for just $3.

Pfizer's patent for the drug Viagra ran out in June and now its cost has plummeted

The cheaper varieties are being stocked in chemists throughout the country - and according to the Sydney Morning Herald - Chemist Warehouse, Blooms and Terry White are passing on the reduced cost for $14 for four 100mg pills of the drug.

The once discernible diamond-shaped blue pill is now being marketed in all different shapes and sizes but the active ingredient, Sildenafil, will remain.

Erectile dysfunction expert Chris McMahon said the high price has been a major stumbling block for consumers in the past, and cheaper varieties such as APO-Sildenafil are now giving men greater access.

‘The high price has always been a stumbling block preventing many men from being able to afford to use the drug regularly,’ he said.

It also means men who were previously healthy, but were left impotent as result of cancer or diabetes, can benefit too.

In cases where erection problems are associated with diseases most men in Australia received no financial compensation, with very few private health funds paying for such treatments.

National Chairman of Prostate Cancer Foundation David Sandoe said women with breast cancer receive government support for reconstruction from mastectomies, but men do not receive the same luxury for impotency as a result of prostate cancer surgery.

‘It’s never made sense that male cancer victims are treated so differently from women,’’ he said.

In Britain, Viagra was costing the National Health Service more than £40 million ($72 million) a year before Pfizer’s patent ran out in June last year.

Many are hoping the new cheap Viagra will dissuade men from ordering potentially dangerous erection drugs online.

It might also mean it cuts some of the embarrassment associated with buying the recogniseable blue pill many feel ashamed about doing over the counter because it will be marketed in different forms.
