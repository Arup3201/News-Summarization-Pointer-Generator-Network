Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the introduction of the 'under-occupancy penalty' is not designed to punish pensioners

A 'bedroom tax' being introduced by the Government could force pensioners to move into smaller houses.

The measures, which are part of the new universal credit scheme, will mean that those with a spare bedroom will be penalised.

Around 600,000 are expected to be affected by the reforms, which are expected to result in a cut of approximately £14 a week.

The plans are aimed at those renting council housing or housing association properties and not those in private properties.

The changes are an attempt to encourage those who have spare bedrooms to downsize.

Pensioners currently living in council properties will not be affected by the changes, which will come into effect in April.

But those entering the benefit system will face deductions in benefits due to the 'under-occupancy penalty'.

The Government has made concessions in the plans, excluding existing elderly claimants where somebody of working age also lives in the property.

But it is understood the exemption will cease to exist for new claimants in mixed-age homes after October, despite mixed homes previously being exempt after the plans are introduced in April.

DWP guidance, seen by the Sunday People, says: 'New housing benefit claimants who are mixed aged couples and claiming pension credit will not be exempt when they transfer on to Universal Credit.'

Cuts: Around 600,000 are expected to be affected by the reforms, which are expected to result in a cut of approximately £14 a week

Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said that the Prime Minister needed to 'get a grip fast' and warned that the scheme could 'descend into chaos'

Shadow work and pensions secretary 
Liam Byrne criticised the plans, saying: 'Ministers promised to protect 
pensioners from the bedroom tax, but thousands are set to lose out.'

He added: 'David Cameron had better get a grip fast, before this scheme descends into total chaos.'

Iain Duncan Smith, however, said that pensioners would not suffer because of the plans and said that the application of the rules had yet to be finalised.

Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show, he said: 'The reality is that they are looking at universal credit further down the road.

'It is not our intention that pensioners in any way will suffer.'

He added: 'This is not about punishing people. This is about trying to reallocate the housing. It is about getting the balance right.'
