Only three of the 11 men arrested over suspected sex offences in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal are likely to be charged, it emerged last night.

Detectives believe there will be insufficient evidence to prosecute the majority of the suspects  quizzed under Operation Yewtree.

Former BBC producer Wilfred De’Ath, 75, who was arrested over an alleged sex assault in 1965, was released  without charge on Monday evening.

And speculation was mounting last night that Freddie Starr would soon be told that he, too, will not be charged over claims he attempted to grope a 14-year-old in Savile’s BBC changing room in 1974.

The police operation – which is thought to have cost £1million and has 30 dedicated detectives – has already been criticised by some as a ‘celebrity witch-hunt’.

Earlier this month, one of Britain’s top prosecution lawyers was accused of hyping up the investigation as if it were a ‘box office event’ when he told the public to expect a dramatic new wave of celebrity arrests.

If, as seems likely, only a handful of men are charged, there are sure to be uncomfortable questions for the police over the handling of the probe.

Yard chiefs insist all arrests by detectives on Yewtree have been ‘necessary and proportionate’. But Mr De’Ath, who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused officers of being ‘over-zealous’.

He said the police had failed ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign of terror while he was still alive – so were now going ‘too far the other way’ in pursuing ‘spurious’ claims against others.

Only three of those arrested under Operation Yewtree - the Savile inquiry - are likely to be charged

‘My general comment would be that Operation Yewtree has gone too far,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘It is getting silly now.’

Other celebrities arrested by the Yewtree squad include the comedian Jim Davidson, PR guru Max Clifford and disgraced pop star Gary Glitter, all of whom deny any wrongdoing.

Another celebrity – a man in his 80s who has not been named publicly – was interviewed under caution over sex allegations in November.

Davidson, 59, was detained over historic sex allegations – not involving children – shortly before he was due to appear on Celebrity Big Brother in January and rearrested last week over new allegations dating back to 1978.

His second arrest came a week after DJ Dave Lee Travis, 67, was rearrested over sex allegations involving adults. He too denies wrongdoing.

At his £1million home in Stockbridge, Hampshire, Mr Davidson said yesterday: ‘The pendulum has now swung right to the other end; from doing nothing with Savile to this.’

He added: ‘The allegations against me are to do with adults and go back over 35 years, one is from 1978. And the only thing I remember from back then is Abba!

‘It costs nothing to tell the truth 
and all I can do is tell the truth. It costs to tell lies. If an 
allegation is made, the police have to look into it whatever  the cost.

‘I just hope they look into my evidence with as much vigour and skill and I trust that they will.’

Freddie Starr, 70, who was arrested in November, weeks after the Savile scandal erupted, has also complained about his treatment.

He was taken into custody near his home in Warwickshire and questioned over claims he tried to grope a woman called Karin Ward when she was 14.

Ward, who waived her right to anonymity, claimed Starr had had a ‘very bad attack of wondering hands’ with her nearly 40 years ago. He vehemently denied her claims.

It prompted Starr to seek an injunction to prevent the claims being aired, but his High Court application was rejected.

He initially denied ever meeting his accuser, or appearing with her on Savile’s 1974 BBC show Clunk Click, but footage later emerged of him and Miss Ward in the same shot.

The comedian claims he has lost 
£1million in earnings from cancelled shows. After police raided his home
and seized a computer hard-drive, address books, photographs and his 
iPhone, Starr said: ‘It’s horrible. I’m being made to feel like a 
criminal.

‘I’ve never ever been in trouble before and I haven’t got a police record.

‘It’s heartbreaking and it’s affecting my health and everything. It’s unbelievable. I’m absolutely drained.’

A friend of Miss Ward told the Mail she had not expected Starr to be arrested, let alone charged, over the alleged incident.

The friend said: ‘Karin has always known there was a chance Starr would not be charged because it would probably come down to her word against his.

‘If she was the only witness, then a prosecution was always less likely to  go ahead.’

Earlier this month, Nazir Afzal, chief crown prosecutor in the North West, said detectives will soon arrest a number of ‘very high profile’ figures suspected of child sex abuse.

He described child-sex abuse investigations as a ‘growing industry’.

Critics said Mr Afzal should not hype up any impending arrests like a ‘box office event’.

A number of defence lawyers believe there should now be a new debate over whether those suspected of sex offences, particularly those allegedly involving children, should be named before they are convicted.
