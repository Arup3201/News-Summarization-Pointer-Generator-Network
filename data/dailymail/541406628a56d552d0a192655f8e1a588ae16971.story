Manchester United are going ahead with plans to table a £55million bid for Southampton stars Adam Lallana and Luke Shaw.

Sportsmail understands that United have identified their  primary transfer targets and the strategy will not be affected by David Moyes’s departure or the search for his replacement.

Talks to bring in England left back Shaw, 18, are at an advanced stage, with United confident of sealing a £30m deal.

On the move? Manchester United will offer a fee of £55m for the England duo

And they are offering another £25m for his Southampton team-mate Lallana, who has forced himself into World Cup contention after emerging as one of the most exciting English midfielders in the Premier League this season.

The fee includes add-ons relating to the progress both players make for club and country, as well as a bonus payment to Championship club Bournemouth where Lallana, 25, started his youth career.

It is believed United are on course to complete a double deal with Southampton before the World Cup. The deposed Premier League champions are keen to do their transfer business as early as possible and avoid a repeat of last summer when they chased high-profile targets Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Cesc Fabregas, only to make a solitary signing in Marouane Fellaini.

Barcelona midfielder Fabregas remains high on United’s hit-list and they are still confident of signing Paris Saint-Germain’s £60m-rated striker Edinson Cavani as part of a £200m rebuilding programme.

Old Trafford chief Ed Woodward will also have to move quickly if he wants to install Louis van Gaal as Moyes’s successor before the World Cup.The Holland coach is a firm favourite for the job but will be occupied with international commitments from May 7.

United’s interim boss Ryan Giggs has been put in charge for the final four games of the season and will try to restore the ethos that worked under  Sir Alex Ferguson.

That even extends to his first Press conference, with Giggs changing it back to the same 9.30 time slot and venue favoured by Ferguson.

The United veteran will be assisted by his old team-mates Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and Phil Neville in his first game at home to Norwich tomorrow, and Butt admitted: ‘To be there together is a bit of a surreal thing. We walked in here together when we were 12.

‘I’m not 40 yet but Giggsy is, and myself and Scholes are nearly there. So for us and Phil to be there together is a very proud moment. Saturday is a massive occasion, not only for Ryan, but for the staff, the fans and the players because they know we’ve underachieved.’

Meanwhile, it has emerged Giggs tried to steer Moyes away from trouble even as the United manager’s doomed reign entered its final throes.

Hard line: David Moyes fined Tom Cleverley, Ashley Young and Danny Welbeck for a late night out... but Giggs did not agree

The 40-year-old made a plea to the Scot to show leniency to Ashley Young, Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley after they were photographed on a late night out in Manchester following United’s Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich.

Moyes fined his three England players and ordered them to do extra training last week.

Giggs knew the disciplinary action had gone down badly among the United players and tried to convince Moyes it was unwise. His plea went unheeded although it is unclear if the fines will remain in place now Giggs has been put in charge.
