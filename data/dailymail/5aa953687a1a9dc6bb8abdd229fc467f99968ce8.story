A shipwreck off the coast of Finland may hold the key to beer fanatics enjoying a brew which was created over 170 years ago.

Finnish researchers say they may be able to recreate beer from the 1840s after finding living bacteria in beer from the sunken ship near Aland Islands in the Baltic Sea.

The 2010 discovery of the ship, believed to have sunk in the 1840s, also included the world's oldest champagne considered drinkable, which has since been auctioned off.

Rare find: One of the bottles of beer found in the 1840s shipwreck - researchers say they may be able to recreate beer after finding living bacteria inside

During the summer of 2010 divers discovered unique bottles of champagne in a shipwreck in the Åland archipelago.

The discovery consisted of the world's oldest champagne of the labels Veuve Clicquot, Juglar and Heidsieck.

A total of 145 bottles of champagne were salvaged.

The bottle of shipwrecked Veuve Clicquot sold for $43,630, surpassing the world auction record.

Researchers analysed two bottles of 
beer, which they admitted 'had not stood the test of time well' but 
retained a pale golden colour and could originally have had hints of 
rose, almond and cloves.

'Based on the chemical analysis we 
made of the beer and with help from a master brewer it would be possible
to try to make beer that would resemble it as much as possible,' Annika
Wilhelmson from VTT technical research centre of Finland said.

The wreck lies off Aland, an autonomous part of Finland.

The
name of the sunken vessel is still unknown, as is its destination.

It has been speculated that the cargo was bound for the Russian Tsar's 
court in St Petersburg. 

When it was unearthed, officials stated they believed the beer was the oldest in the world.

'We believe these are by far the 
world's oldest bottles of beer,' Rainer Juslin, a spokesman for the 
local government of Aaland, said in a statement on September 3, 2010.

The enviable haul was found intact on the seabed at a depth of 50 metres.

'The
constant temperature and light levels have provided optimal conditions 
for storage, and the pressure in the bottles has prevented any seawater 
from seeping in through the corks,' the statement said.

The discovery also consisted of the world's oldest champagne of the labels Veuve Clicquot, Juglar and Heidsieck. 

A total of 145 bottles of champagne were salvaged.

The bottle of shipwrecked Veuve Clicquot sold for $43,630, surpassing the world auction record.
