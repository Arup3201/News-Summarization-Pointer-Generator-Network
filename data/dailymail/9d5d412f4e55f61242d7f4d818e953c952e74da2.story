Dick Advocaat’s appointment as Sunderland boss seemed complete on Monday night after he told Dutch TV that he had signed a contract until the end of the season.

The 67-year-old will sign a short-term deal until the end of the season and his package will be incentivised with the target of survival.

Advocaat told Voetbal International: 'I am now in a dark hotel, but soon I'll be working in the Stadium of Light.'

Gus Poyet has been sacked by Sunderland with the club just one point above the relegation zone

Sunderland supporters turned on manager Poyet after their side were thrashed 4-0 by Aston Villa 

525 - Poyet's number of days in charge since his arrival on October 8, 2013.

75 - The Uruguayan's number of games in charge, winning 23, losing 22 and drawing 30.

3 - The number of games against bitter rivals Newcastle. He won them all with an aggregate of 6-1.

35 - Poyet was the 35th man to manage Sunderland either permanently or as a caretaker.

22 - The number of years between Sunderland's appearances in a major final. Poyet took them to the 2014 Capital One Cup final, 22 years on from their defeat to Liverpool in the FA Cup showpiece. They lost to Manchester City.

14 - Sunderland's final position in Poyet's first season.

4 - The amount of games won in the Premier League by Sunderland this season. The joint-worst with bottom side Leicester.

Advocaat could land up to £500,000 if the Black Cats – currently one point above the relegation zone – avoid the drop. He will bring with him Montenegrin coach Zeljko Petrovic, who was Avram Grant's assistant at West Ham in 2010. 

It is unlikely, however, that Advocaat will be considered as the permanent successor to Gus Poyet, who was sacked yesterday after 17 months at the Stadium of Light.

Sportsmail understands that West Ham manager Sam Allardyce and Real Madrid assistant Paul Clement are at the top of the club's shortlist to take charge beyond this season.

Clement, in particular, fits the profile of coach who could work within the structure at the club, where sporting director Lee Congerton has control over transfers.

Clement and Congerton know each other from their time at Chelsea and the Real No 2 is thought to be keen to try his hand as a manager back in England.

Meanwhile, it is Congerton's contacts book which has led to talks with Advocaat.

Former Chelsea sporting director Frank Arnesen – who worked with Advocaat at PSV Eindhoven and Congerton at Stamford Bridge and then Hamburg – has recommended him for the role and he will be installed before Saturday's trip to West Ham.

'This is something I always wanted to do, the Premier League. The Premier League is a phenomenal competition,' Advocaat told AD Sportwereld.

'As a manager that is where you want to work, that has such a pulling power.

'Saturday, West Ham awaits. And then there's the international break. And then – the derby with Newcastle United. That is really something to look forward to because believe me, this just is a very big club.'

Sunderland owner Ellis Short moved swiftly to dismiss Poyet during a telephone conversation after training on Monday. It is understood the Uruguayan asked for his contract – which expires in 2016 – to be paid up in full after he was informed that his position had become untenable.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce could be the long-term successor to Poyet at the Stadium of Light 

His assistant Mauricio Taricco and first-team coach Charlie Oatway are also set to leave the club. 

Former Sunderland favourites and academy coaches Kevin Ball and Paul Bracewell will now be on hand to help at senior level.

Short acted on the advice of the influential Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne in getting rid of Poyet.

They felt there was no way back for the head coach following Saturday's 4-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa.

Supporters tried to storm the dugout and also let their feelings be known to those seated in the directors' box.

The decision was soon made to dispense with Poyet and contact initiated with Advocaat, who left his post as Serbia national team manager in November after just five months in charge. His first home game will be the visit of North-East rivals Newcastle on Easter Sunday.
