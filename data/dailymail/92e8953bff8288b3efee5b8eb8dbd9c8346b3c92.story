A 21-year-old New Jersey woman has given birth to a little boy on her front lawn - and she didn't even know she was pregnant.

Elizabeth Whitehead, already a mother of a nine-month old baby boy, had taken two pregnancy tests but both came back negative. So she thought she had got her long-overdue period when she woke up with cramps on Tuesday morning.

But, as she left the house to head to hospital, she went into labor in the front yard of her Barnegat Township home, delivering a 2.5 pound son.

'It all happened on the grass,' Whitehead told Lacey Patch. 'His head was out when I was on the grass.'

The children's father, David Windham, quickly called 911 and within minutes Barnegat police arrived to find the young mother on the grass with the newborn beside her and the umbilical cord still connecting them.

The officers, Vinnie Damiano and Michael Moore, attempted CPR on the child who wasn't breathing when he was born.

After a short while he began to cry.

They helped an ambulance crew clear his airways before the pair was rushed to hospital.

'Once I heard a little bit of the cry, it kind of made me jump a little bit,' Moore told NBC News.

Windham said the baby and mother were doing OK and thanked the officers for saving his little boy's life.

Whitehead was released from Southern Ocean County Hospital in Manahawkin on Wednesday and the infant is being treated in Jersey Shore University Medical Center's Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.

Whitehead wasn't the only one shocked by the sudden birth.

Neighbors said they were also stunned.

'Can't say that I noticed that she was pregnant,' Pat Faraldi told NBC. 'She carries well.'
