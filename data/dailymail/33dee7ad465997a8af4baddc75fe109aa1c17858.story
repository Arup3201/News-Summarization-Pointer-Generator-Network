75 Australians with apparent links to terror groups have had their passports cancelled by the Federal Government since tough new laws have been brought in to counter the domestic threat.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said that the government has also named its first 'no-go zone' under the Foreign Fighters Bill, the province of Al-Raqqa (Ar-Raqqa) in Syria, some 160 kilometres east of Aleppo.

And Ms Bishop also told parliament that she was looking at declaring more parts of the region as terror zones, where Islamic State is active.

In making this announcement, Ms Bishop said any Australians now in Al-Raqqa province without legitimate purpose should leave immediately. 

It comes after the four El Baf brothers from Sydney's south-west left Australia to fight in Syria. 

Under the legislation, any Australian found to have travelled to a declared region without good reason can face up to 10 years jail for the offence. Only those who provide proof on humanitarian or family grounds will be granted permission.

Al-Raqqa is regarded as the heartland of the Islamic State group which controls most of the province capital Raqqa.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said foreign fighters and supporters of foreign conflicts posed a significant threat to Australia and our way of life.

'Declaring Al-Raqqa province under the criminal code sends a strong message to those Australians who seek to participate in the Syrian conflict,' she said.

This provision was enacted earlier this year to target terror tourism, making it an offence to travel to designated conflict zones.

Previously, in the absence of any other evidence of offences committed, those who travelled to such destinations committed no offences under Australian law.

She said the government was determined to stop Australians from supporting and engaging in hostile activities with listed terrorist organisations.

IS has been enforcing a brutal rule in Al-Raqqa, including the murder of opponents, rape and enslavement of women and intimidation and subjugation of the civilian population, she said.

'It is one of the world's most deadly and active terrorist organisations and has been listed as a terrorist organisation in Australia under its various names since 2005,' she said.

About 60 Australians are believed to be fighting with Islamist terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq, with the UN estimating about 200 foreign fighters joining IS every month.

'So the threat is growing,' Ms Bishop told parliament on Thursday.

Ms Bishop has also refused to issue another 10 to people planning to travel to the region.

Labor deputy leader Tanya Plibersek said Al-Raqqa was the centre of gravity of IS, from where it launched attacks on Iraq and other parts of Syria.

'There are Australians in senior positions in this organisation in this area. There is no good reason for any Australian to be on the ground in this area, particularly not in the positions that we seen in this organisation,' she said.

Ms Plibersek said Labor was pleased to support this extraordinary measure of declaring a whole area a no-go zone.

'We are very concerned about the increasing numbers of Australians going to this region and the broader region to fight,' she said.

Advice on the Department of Foreign Affairs Smartraveller website clearly warns: "Do not travel."
