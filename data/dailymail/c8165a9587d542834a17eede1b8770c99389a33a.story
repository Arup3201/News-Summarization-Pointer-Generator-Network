It's the afternoon after surgery and Big Brother's Skye Wheatley is writhing in agony in her hospital bed.

The pretty blonde from the Gold Coast is unusually quiet after undergoing a boob job at Bangkok's Piyavate Hospital to increase her asymmetrical 10A and 10C chest to matching Ds.

Propped up against a mountain of pillows, drains attached to her bandaged chest, she calls for the nurse demanding more pain killers before glancing down at her chest and declaring: 'Hello my lovely Bangkok babies!'

Dream come true: Big Brother's Skye Wheatley is recovering after undergoing a boob job at Bangkok's Piyavate Hospital to increase her asymmetrical 10A and 10C chest to matching Ds

The reality TV star is among 15,000 Australians who fly to Thailand every year in pursuit of affordable cosmetic surgery.

But some Australian medical experts have growing concerns over the commercialisation of cosmetic surgery, especially patients who travel abroad to go under the knife.

Ta da! Skye admires the work of her Bangkok doctor post surgery 

The 20-year-old barista from Labrador has long wanted to correct and enhance her wonky cleavage, insisting boyfriends called her 'pancake' because of her flat chest.

Fed up with feeling deflated, she signed up to a 10-day tour with Australian-wide medical tourism agency, Medi Makeovers, lured by the promise of cut price surgery.

Instead of forking out up to $12,000-$15,000 for a breast augmentation Down Under, patients can get breast implants and other procedure  often for a third of the price at $3,800 with highly qualified plastic surgeons.

Skye, however, didn't anticipate the pain of undergoing three-hour surgery, which she describes as 'the worst I have ever felt.'

Holding her chest tightly, mascara tears rolling down her eyes, she added: 'This has to be worse than childbirth, surely?'

'I've ripped my nail off, I've split my head open but this is something else.

'No one who's had a boob job ever tells you about the pain, they just sit on the beach and say "I love my boobies."

'I've got Tourette's Syndrome, the pain is so bad I can't stop swearing.'

There are 15,000 Australians who jet to Thailand every year seeking cheaper cosmetic surgery at the hands of highly qualified surgeons for often a third of the price of the equivalent procedure in Australia.

Thailand, which once bore company with dodgy back street surgeons and unsafe practises, is today the hub of a booming multi-billion dollar medical tourism industry, which pulled in a staggering $4.31 billion in revenue in 2013.

Dr Tim Papadopoulos, the president of the Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, is concerned about the commercialisation of cosmetic surgery and patients who travel abroad to contribute to this lucrative business.

He describes the recent hype over medical tourism - cosmetic surgery in particular - as a 'global health bazaar'. 

A good deal: Instead of forking out up to $12,000-$15,000 for a breast augmentation Down Under, patients can get breast implants and other procedures, often for a third of the price at $3,800 with highly qualified plastic surgeons

Reality sets in: Holding her chest tightly, mascara tears rolling down her eyes, she added: 'This has to be worse than childbirth, surely?'

In pain: Skye found herself in tears following the surgery

But what's most distressing for Dr Papadopoulos is that medical tourism companies are subject to little oversight and not obliged to undergo accreditation.

'Commercialisation of cosmetic surgery and medical tourism threatens our efforts to convince the public that medicine is not a commodity or a trade,' Dr Papadopoulos told Daily Mail Australia.

'It emphasises positive outcomes and downplays the pain and risks of medical intervention.' 

And he's seen firsthand the 'good, the bad and the ugly of medical tourism'.

'Most times patients get good results but we do deal with a number of patients who come to us for complications from overseas procedures,' Dr Papadopoulos said.

Common complications include: infections, incompletely healed wounds and asymmetrical scars.

'Some of the important risks patients should be aware of is whether they are going to an appropriate institution or facility,' Dr Papadopoulos said.

'They should also know about their doctor, whether they are properly qualified and whether the plastic surgery is board certified.'

Step-by-step: Daily Mail Australia has followed Skye's plastic surgery journey

On top of the world: The Gold Coast babe talked of her pain following her procedure but is happy with the end result

'The pain is so bad I can't stop swearing': Overwhelmed by pain following her operation, Skye burst into tears 

The cosmetic surgery journey for Skye began when she arrived in Bangkok on Monday night. 

The following morning she saw reconstructive plastic surgeon doctor Rungkit Tanjapatkul who sized her up suggesting different types of implants to align her breasts - and who advised her to drop her dream of DDs for Ds.

That same night she was wheeled into surgery and, recalling the experience the next day, Skye said: 'I was so scared I prayed to God. I told him "I'm so grateful for everything, except my boobs, God, please look after me on the operating table."' 

The reality star, known for her flirtatious antics on the show with fellow contestants Jake Richardson and Ryan 'Leo' Burke, will be discharged from hospital on Thursday at 2pm once her drains and bandages have been removed. 

Happy on the inside: Despite the tears, Skye is ecstatic about her new 10D breasts

Considerations: Skye stands in front of a mirror in a white T-shirt to see what will work 

She will spend the next week convalescing at the city's five star Grande Centre Point Ploenchit hotel.

Skye's stitches will be removed in seven days and she has been advised to wear compression garments for three months.

'I can't wait to see them,' she says, adding, 'They feel nice already, really plump, whoever said fake boobs don't feel good? I'm so excited.'

'Deformed': The former barista from the Gold Coast insists her size 10 assets are asymmetrical

Medi Makeovers is a mother-and-daughter medical travel agency with consultants in Sydney, the Gold Coast, Adelaide and New Zealand.

Set up in 2006 by former beauty therapist and salon owner Daniela Pratico, it sends over an average fifty Australians for plastic surgery to Thailand every month.

It is billed as Australia's number one medical travel agency, working with the Royal Thai Consulate-General and Thai Government.

Clients hail from the UK, USA, Canada, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Guam, Russia, Sweden, China and Japan.

Since placing third in Big Brother last year, Skye has been besieged with calls from marketing companies and publicity reps, asking her to endorse products on social media, including everything from bikinis to underwear- offers she feels she can't take full advantage of until after surgery.

'I need to look symmetrical now,' she says. 

'It's not about size, it's about choice,' she says, adding, 'Why not if you can? I like the perfect look.'

She insists she wants to remain single 'for now', having spent many years in relationships.

And she plans to take up professional singing lessons and carve out a career in music, while continuing promotional work for brands.

Nerves: Sitting in the waiting room, the reality star is overwhelmed with some level of anxiety 

Overseas trip: Skye has travelled abroad for the first time with Australia-wide medical travel agency Medi Makeovers to fix what she calls ‘wonky boobs’ that have made her feel deflated for years

'You know, I just want to be a reality star forever,' she says.

'This is all about me now,' she adds. 

'I need to find out what I want in life and to look good for myself and not worry about having a boyfriend or what a boyfriend wants.'

Doctor Rungkit told Daily Mail Australia Thailand is the 'hub' of cosmetic surgery with the bulk of clients coming from Australia.

'Plastic surgery is a growing industry in Thailand, people never stop wanting to look young and better. If anything the numbers of people wanting surgery will only increase.'
