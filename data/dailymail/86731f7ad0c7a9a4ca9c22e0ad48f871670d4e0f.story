A one-year-old girl from Alabama has died after being locked for nearly three hours inside an overheated SUV - and her heartbroken mother blames herself for the tragedy.

Police in the Birmingham suburb of Homewood say 11-month-old Gabriella Gi-Ny Luong was found inside her mother’s white Lexus SUV Wednesday after Katie Luong forgot about her daughter as she rushing.

The infant was rushed to the Children's of Alabama hospital but could not be resuscitated.

According to officers, the girl's temperature was about 105 degrees when they arrived, and inside the vehicle it was about 130 degrees.

Devastated: Katie Luong is said to be inconsolable after she left her 11-month-old daughter in the boiling car

Heartbreak: The child was found still locked in her car seat and was rushed to hospital but paramedics were unable to revive her

Tragedy struck just before 1.30pm Wednesday when Katie Luong approached her SUV parked on 19th Street and Oxmoor Road on Homewood, only to discover her baby daughter unresponsive inside. The child was still strapped into her car seat.

Searing heat: Gabriella was just days away from her first birthday

First responders who arrived on the scene attempted to revive little Gabrielle before taking her to Children's of Alabama hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later.

According to a local business owner, the child's family operate Genesis Nail Spa. Her mother, 31-year-old Katie Luong, usually takes the daughter to a day care center, but on that morning, she had too many things on her mind.

The witness said that the toddler was locked inside the vehicle from 10.30am to 1.30pm. The temperature outside was around 91 degrees that day, but inside the car it was closer to 130, police said.

On Thursday, Gabriella's mother stated to AL.com that she blames no one but herself for her daughter's death.

‘I
want to tell everybody that I wish I was in that car seat, not her,’ 
Katie Luong said. ‘If I had to die for her to live, I would have done 
that.’

The inconsolable 
mother explained that she was supposed to drop her daughter off at a 
babysitter's house Wednesday but was preoccupied by thoughts of an 
employee who recently hung himself and a close family friend who had a 
stroke and is still hospitalized.

Luong
said she and her husband were also in the midst of planning Gabriella’s
first birthday party for Sunday, which only added to her stress.

‘I had an uneasy feeling,’' she said. ‘I told my mom I felt like something was going to happen.’

After
visiting her husband at the nail salon, Luong continued about her day, 
heading to work. It was not until she got a call from her daughter’s 
babysitter at around 1.15pm asking her why she had failed to bring Ella 
over as planned that the mother realized what happened.

The frantic woman dashed over to her car, only to find her daughter’s limp body still strapped into her seat.

Chris Conn, who works at a nearby fitness center, rushed over to help and attempted to perform CPR on the little girl.

Horrible loss: Katie Luong's family and friends described her as a doting and loving mother

‘Her body was radiating heat,’ he recalled to CBS42, putting the child’s body temperature at about 105 degrees.

Little
Gabriella, know to her loved ones as Ella, was Luong's miracle baby. 
She and her husband had tried for years to conceive, but she only became
pregnant following a collective prayer at the couple’s church.

The
overjoyed couple decided to name their firstborn after the archangel 
Gabriel, and her birth had even inspired her father to open a seminary.

‘I asked God for this baby,’ Luong said. ‘She was our gift from God.’

Outpouring of support: A makeshift memorial has sprung up outside the couple's business, with friends and strangers alike leaving flowers, stuffed animals and notes offering their condolences

Those who know the couple have 
described them as extremely doting and loving parents, and devout 
Christians. Mrs Luong has expressed hope that her faith will carry her 
through this tragedy.

Gabriella is the 21st child to die inside a hot car this year alone, CBS News
reported. On average, about 37 kids lose their lives in this manner a 
year, according to Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist at San
Francisco State University.

Since
1998, a total of 582 children have fallen victim to heat stroke after 
being left inside cars. Just over half of those fatalities were caused 
by caregivers forgetting the kids in the car.

In 18 per cent of the instances, the children were deliberately locked inside cars.
