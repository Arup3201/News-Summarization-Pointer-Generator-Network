A five-month-old puppy was 'trampled to death' by a German Shepherd after its owner let the dog off the lead.

Karen Ellis-Fraser was walking her dachshund-beagle cross Scooby with two of her children, when she claims the puppy was attacked by the bigger dog.

Although the German Shepherd was muzzled, Ms Ellis-Fraser said he pinned down the family pet and stood on him, crushing his lungs during the attack at a popular walking area just outside Tain in Easter Ross.

Ms Ellis-Fraser, 30, said she spotted the larger animal with his owner Andy Sutherland, 75, as they set out on the Aldie Burn forest trail.

But when they reached the halfway point on their two-mile trek, she turned round and saw the long-haired German shepherd running towards them - without his owner.

She said the dog then pinned down the puppy and jumped on him as her children tried in vain to wrestle it away.

After the incident, she held Scooby in her arms as her children screamed.

Ms Ellis-Fraser, from Tain, said: 'At this point the owner appeared but he did not call the dog away or try to run after it.

'All of us were screaming ‘You have killed Scooby’.

Police investigated and referred the matter to Highland Council’s dog warden services.

Ms Ellis-Fraser has said she has since received a letter from the dog warden services saying 
advice had been given to the owner of the German shepherd and that 'no 
further action will be taken'.

The mother said the dog was particularly important to the family as it helped communication with a daughter who is autistic.

She added: 'We won’t be able to replace Scooby. This has traumatised all of us.'

Mr Sutherland, 75, also of Tain, said he had let his dog Prince off the lead because he was muzzled, on the advice of a close friend.

He said: 'This was the biggest mistake I ever made.

'Ordinarily, my dog is never off the lead. I did not see what happened but I heard screams from children.

'The problem is I can’t run because of a disability. Eventually I got round there and the woman told me that my dog had killed her dog.'

Scooby was seen by an Invergordon vet, who said the animal had died of swelling round its lungs caused by bruising.
