A woman has won compensation for sexual harassment after a work Christmas party went terribly, terribly wrong.

A court heard that victim’s female manager repeatedly requested that she take part in a lesbian threesome, propositioning the employee on several occasions – including the 2011 office Christmas party.

The victim was working at the café at the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, ‘Connect Café’ as the supervisor when the sexual advances began.

She was harassed by her manager, who told the victim that ‘her breasts were nice’ before lifting her shirt in front of the employee.

The victim alleges that four deeply concerning sexual harassment incidents took place.

The victim and her husband both gave evidence of the manager’s suggestive and inappropriate behaviour, explaining that it offended the victim and made her uncomfortable.

The court heard that nine days before the Christmas party, the offending woman repeatedly told the victim ‘I’m not wearing any undies’.

Whilst the victim drove her manager to the work function at Brisbane’s Stamford Hotel on that date, the passenger said words to the effect of, ‘I’m sitting in your leather seats with no undies on.’

Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal member, Ann Fitzpatrick, found that the interaction regarding the defendant’s underwear was ‘not sexual harassment’ as it was light-hearted and in a group context.

It’s claimed that soon after, the manager began to bully the employee, acting in an ‘aggressive and abusive’ manner after her sexual advances had been rejected.

The tribunal also found that Queensland Health inadequately dealt with the victim’s complaints, ‘poorly investigating’ her claims of sexual and workplace harassment.

The offending manager and Queensland Health have been ordered to jointly pay the employee $9000 in compensation.

The employee was seeking $80,000 to $100,000 in damages for the ‘hurt and humiliation’ she suffered.

A tribunal also found that the female victim is suffering from ‘psychological injury’ as a result of the harassment, which took place at the 2011 work Christmas party at Brisbane’s Paddington Tavern.

The employee suffered so badly from the incident, as well as from her manager’s ‘aggressive and abusive management’, that she was forced to quit.

Queensland Health made submissions to claim that victim’s harassment claims were a ploy to ‘deflect from her own poor work performance.’
