Harrison Reed is called ‘Ray Donovan’ by his Southampton team-mates because he solves problems in central midfield.

Donovan, the eponymous hero of an American television series, is the go-to problem-solver for Hollywood celebrities.

Reed stamped his mark 17 minutes into his first Barclays Premier League start when he ran to the touchline to hustle the ball out of play. The simple act brought loud applause from the St Mary’s crowd.

Youngster Harrison Reed is nicknamed 'Ray Donovan' for his ability to solve problems in midfield

The 19-year-old had an impressive game in his first Premier League start of his Southampton career

The Saints youngster's presence in front of the back line helped his side to victory against Everton  

But for a 19-year-old he brought a certain maturity to his play in front of the back four.

It was a demanding role but the red-headed Reed’s non-stop hustling and astute passing provided the foundation for Southampton to cruise to victory and end a run of five defeats.

Team-mate Shane Long explained: ‘I call him Ray Donovan because he just cleans up in midfield. I was really impressed since the first day I came in.

‘It is hard to get a game with the quality we have in midfield, but two suspensions (Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama) and Jack Cork injured as well, have given him a chance and he took it. He was immense.’

Graziano Pelle scored his eighth Premier League goal for Southampton with his side's second of the day

Everton were expected to mount a serious challenge for the top four this season but have struggled for form

An own goal from Romelu Lukaku and strikes by Graziano Pelle and Maya Yoshida won the game, but Reed was the hero in the shadows.

Defensive midfield is hardly a role that youngsters dream of playing but Reed is making the best of his ability.

‘He is not the best technical player but showed unbelievable spirit and good character to win battles in midfield,’ said manager Ronald Koeman.

‘A young one in your team needs to be comfortable in the position he plays. He played in his best position, in front of the three centre backs and was comfortable. He was outstanding.’
