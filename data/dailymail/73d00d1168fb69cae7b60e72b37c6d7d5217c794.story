A 19-year-old mother burst into tears when the prosecutor demanded she spend 15 years in a  Bali prison today - but spared her the death penalty. 

Heather Mack and her 21-year-old boyfriend Tommy Schaefer were in court accused of murdering Heather's mother, Sheila Von Wiese-Mack in a plush Bali hotel last August and then stuffing her body in a suitcase.

The Prosecution at Denpasar District Court also want Schaefer to be sentenced to 18 years in jail and tears rolled down his face when he heard the news through an interpreter.

The 21-year-old from Chicago also cried as translators relayed the news that prosecutors want him to serve an 18-year sentence over the death of Mack's mother, Sheila Von Wiese-Mack

19-year-old Mack, looking at her child, was told she had 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother', but the prosecutors said they had been 'lenient as she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby'

A teary and nervous looking Mack puffed on a cigarette as she waited to hear what sentence would be demanded by the prosecutor

Mack was told by the chief prosecutor Eddy Arta Wijaya she had 'committed sadistic acts to her own mother', but was spared the death penalty 'because she repeatedly expressed remorse and has a newborn baby'.  

Since being held in jail, the 19-year-old from Chicago has been keeping her 15-day old baby, Stella, with her in the crowded cell in Bali's Kerobokan prison.

In a bizarre comment from her holding cell today, Mack said with a grin that Stella has six fingers on her left hand, saying: 'But don't worry, she's OK, thank you.'

As she waited in the cell, nervously puffing on a cigarette, Mack added that she and her co-accused boyfriend were married 'in spirit'.

She said: 'He has made us a ring each to wear from his side of the prison. 

She held up a hand revealing a red plastic ring. 'Tommy's is blue,' she added. 

It will now be up to the defence team to try to get the sentence reduced, or even thrown out.

The court will resume next week when the defence begins its case. 

Jail sentences of less than 20 years for each of the defendants are far more lenient than the death penalty or lifetime in prison that many had expected to be handed down for the gruesome crime.

A teary Mack hears the prosecution case today and her and Schaefer's defence lawyers will begin their arguments to have the sentence reduced - or the case thrown out - next week

Schaefer has admitted hitting the victim with the metal handle of a fruit bowl in self-defense while his girlfriend has been accused of helping him to force the body into a suitcase, which was then loaded into the boot of a taxi they had ordered. 

The couple did not board the taxi, however, instead leaving the hotel by a rear exit.

They tried to leave Bali through the airport but they did not have their passports, which were being held in a safe deposit box at the hotel - and Mack was allegedly the only person who had permission to open the box.

Mack and Schaefer were arrested the following day at another Bali hotel.  

Mack, who said during an earlier court hearing that she did not wish her mother dead, said they panicked after Schaefer’s attack with the metal bowl.

She said they thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the US Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one. 

When the prison gates opened today to take the couple, who are separated inside, to the court, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella - the first time he had been seen with her

Polydactyly is a medical term used to describe extra fingers on the hands or toes on the feet.

The extra fingers or toes may be small and non-functional,  or they may be fully formed with bones and joints.

Extra digits can exist in different places on the hands and feet. 

Extra digits can also be located in the centre of the hand or foot, and people with polydactyly often have extra digits on both hands or feet.

Polydactyly occurs when the body follows a different set of directions than usual while forming the hands or feet during development.

It is inhertited and can be passed on by just one parent if they have the disorder.

Researchers are still discovering the genes that cause extra digits.

But the trait may exist as part of a syndrome, which is a group of several recognisable clinical features that often occur together.

When the prison gates opened today to take the couple - who are separated inside - to the court, onlookers were surprised to see Schaefer carrying baby Stella as it was the first time he had been seen with her.

After arriving at court, it was Mack who held the baby when she and her boyfriend emerged from the prison van.

They were led to separate holding cells and Mack sat at the rear of hers with her arms wrapped around the baby, who was covered in a white shawl.

She was observed breastfeeding the baby under the garment. 

The child was then handed to Schaefer, who lowered his face to her head and began tenderly kissing his daughter.

'He looked every part like the doting father,' said a photographer. 'It was the kind of scene you'd see anywhere in a playground for example - but he was behind bars.

'It seemed a bit strange to be seeing something like that.'  

Mack said she intended to continue breastfeeding for two years. 

A woman looking after the couple claim they were not using the child as a way to sway judges' feelings. 

The baby was born on March 17 and had to be treated in the jail clinic and then in hospital after developing a high fever and jaundice.

The child was later allowed to be taken back to the prison with her mother.

The hearing will now move onto the next stage - when the argument is put forward by the defence.  

It is estimated that it will be at least a month before the judges make the final decision on whether the pair are guilty. 

Mack is allowed to keep her baby with her in her cell - which she is sharing with eight other women - until the child is two years old. 

She revealed there was another prison baby, aged seven months, in a separate cell.
