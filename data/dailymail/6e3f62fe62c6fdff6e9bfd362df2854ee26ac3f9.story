Dozens of residents of a small community in Cape Cod,
Massachusetts, have filed lawsuits claiming that a trio of large wind turbines
located near their homes have been harming their health. 

In the summer of 2010, the town of Falmouth and a private
company called Notus Clean Energy erected three 400-feet-tall, 1.63 megawatt
wind turbines.

Just months later, Sue Hobart, a 57-year-old wedding
florist, began experiencing spells of dizziness, bouts of insomnia, ringing in
her ears and severe headaches.

Plaintiff: Sue Hobart, a 57-year-old wedding florist, has filed a lawsuit claiming that a trio of wind turbines that were installed in her town of Falmouth, Massachusetts, had made her sick

Too close for comfort: Mrs Hobart said that just months after the town and a private energy company installed the turbines 1,600 feet from her home, she began experiencing insomnia, dizziness and tinnitus

At first, Mrs Hobart attributed her symptoms to the onset of
old age, but then she noticed that whenever she was away from home, the
symptoms vanished.

‘Sometimes at night, especially in the winter, I wake up
with a fluttering in the chest and think, “What the hell is that,”’ and the
only place it happens is at my house,’ she told ABC News.

Hobart began suspecting that the culprits behind her ailments
may be the trio of wind turbines whirring away day and night just 1,600 feet
from her home.

In 2011, a doctor at Harvard Medical School diagnosed the
woman with 'wind turbine syndrome’ - a controversial health condition that is
not recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

'Wind Turbine Syndrome' refers to an alleged medical disorder in which people who live in close proximity to turbines begin experiencing a wide array of symptoms, such as tinnitus, dizziness, migraines and insomnia.

The name was coined by Dr Nina Pierpont, a pediatrician from Johns Hopkins Hospital whose husband has been lobbying against the proliferation of wind energy. 

In 2009, Pierpont self-published the book 'Wind Turbine Syndrome,' which included case studies of people who reportedly got sick as a result of their proximity to wind farms.

The wind turbine syndrome, dubbed by Pierpont the green energy industry's 'dirty little secret,' is not recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Piepront's research has come under fire from industry experts, who accused her of possibly skewing the data by looking at a small sample size without a control group and failing to submit her results for an impartial peer review.

The name of the alleged disorder was coined by Dr Nina
Pierpont, a pediatrician whose husband has been lobbying against the
proliferation of wind energy.

Pierpont self-published the book 'Wind Turbine syndrome' in
2009, providing case studies of people who reportedly got sick as a result of
their proximity to wind turbines.

'Many people living within 2 km (1.25 miles) of these
spinning giants get sick. So sick that they often abandon (as in, lock the door
and leave) their homes,’ according to the book’s description. ‘Nobody wants to
buy their acoustically toxic homes.'

Pierpont's research has come under criticism from wind
energy advocates, who claim that her data was unreliable because she used only
a small sample size, had no control group, interviewed her subjects by phone
and then hand-picked experts for the peer review process.

Hobart and her husband filed a nuisance claim against Notus
Clean Energy and its owner in February, seeking between $150,000 and $300,000
in damages for the loss of their home value and medical bills.

The lawyer representing the owner of the energy company, Dan
Webb, responded to the complaint by stating that Notus' operating permit was
'subject to rigorous review' and the company was in compliance with all the regulations. 

‘Scientific research and studies have shown that wind
turbines such as Notus do not cause a nuisance or adverse health effects,’ said
attorney Michael O'Neill in the court filing.

According to Notus, in three years of operation the turbines
have prevented emissions of more than 7,000 tons of carbon dioxide from
conventional power plants.

The lawyer also said that the nearest home to its turbines
is located some 1,700 feet away, which is about 500 feet further away than the
distance required under state law.

Wind turbines are used to generate electricity from the
kinetic power of the wind. There are two main kinds of wind generators:  those with a vertical axis, and those with a
horizontal axis.

Expert opinion: A study by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and Public Health has concluded that wind turbines like the ones erect in Falmouth (pictured) present little more than an 'annoyance' to residents

Most wind energy 
comes from turbines that can be as tall as a 20-story building and have 
three 200-foot-long blades, according to National Geographic.

The
biggest wind turbines generate enough electricity to supply about 600 
U.S. homes. a single megawatt produced by a wind turbine is enough to 
power about 250 homes.

Generation of energy by wind turbines more than quadrupled between 2000 and 2006 worldwide.

Germany currently leads the world in the number of wind turbines, followed by Spain, the United States, India, and Denmark. Industry experts predict that, by 2050 a third of the world's electricity will be generated by turbines.

Neil and Betsy Anderson, also of Falmouth, were major supporters
of green energy until their town installed two turbines 1,320 and 2,320 feet
away from their home.

Mr Anderson said that within a week, he began experiencing pressure
in his ears, which later turned into tinnitus, as well as shortness of breath,
headaches and heart palpitations.

The homeowner’s wife had suffered from debilitating migraines,
which she had attributed to the turbines working around the clock.

Some experts have suggested that symptoms reported by
residents of towns located near turbines could be purely psychological in
nature and caused by the nocebo effect - the negative reaction experienced by a
patient who is exposed to a harmless substance.

Controversial figure: The name 'wind tirbune syndrome' was coined by Dr Nina Pierpont (left), who in 2009 self-published a book on the subject (right) with case studies of people who reportedly got sick from  turbines

Mr Anderson, however, insisted that his symptoms were purely
physical and not the products of an overactive imagination.

‘Just come in to my house and feel the walls shaking,’ he
said

A recent study commissioned by the Massachusetts Department
of Environmental Protection and Public Health has concluded that wind turbines
present little more than an ‘annoyance’ to residents.

A 2010 study conducted by the National Health and Median
Research Council of Australia found no negative effects from wind technology.

Meanwhile, Sue Hobart said that she was forced to move away
from Falmouth and put her home, which she and her husband had built themselves,
up for sale, but it's value has dropped by half after she went public with her
complaints about the nearby turbines.
