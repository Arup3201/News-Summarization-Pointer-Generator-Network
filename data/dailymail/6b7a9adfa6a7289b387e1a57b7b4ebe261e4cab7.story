It could pose the Holy Grail to a problem all snuggling cohabiting couples face.

With its genius construction, the Cuddle Mattress promises to allow night cuddling without risking a dreaded dead arm.

It comprises a single foam block central portion for the body, and ten slats at the top and ten at the bottom, allowing for arms and feet to dip in.

The Cuddle Mattress features clever foam slats allowing for cuddling arms to slide in comfortably

The three-inch wide slats part easily from one another, leaving room to slide an arm beneath a partner and leave it there.

The Cuddle Mattress could strengthen relationships, says its designer, by letting partners remain cuddled together.

Because their body is supported by the slats on each side of the encircling arm, it should not get squashed, however long it is left there.

The mattress designer says a similar arrangement at the foot of the bed means anyone who is able to tear themselves away from their partner for the night can sleep face-down with their toes pointing down into the mattress and snug between the slats.

Dead arms need not be an issue with this genius concept by award-winning designer Mehdi Mojtabavi

The man behind the mattress is award-winning designer Mehdi Mojtabavi.

He says that although it is a very technical design, it also has a power for emotional - and psychological - good. Mr Mojtabavi, an Iranian, writes: 'Embracing is a magical human behaviour, and one that distinguishes us from other animals.

'A loving embrace, especially between partners, is one of the most calming actions. Embracing, and bodily proximity and connection after love-making, are very important for strengthening relationships,' Mr Mojtabavi claims.

'However, what usually stops this pleasant state is not mental tiredness, it is physical weakness.'

You can wedge your arms and feet in between the pillowy slats. The mattress comes with special sheets

If you tear away from your partner for the night, you can sleep face-down with your toes pointing down

The mattress is still at prototype stage but has won a number of awards since it was first made public in 2007.

The Facebook page says: 'Cuddle Mattress lets you hug your better half intimately without any wrist or arm problems. You'll sleep better and you can cuddle longer.

'We all like a little cuddling, but the muscles, blood vessels and nerves in our limbs often pay the price.

'When we do stop cuddling, it's not for lack of desire, but it's because we're physically uncomfortable.

Ultimate comfort

The mattress allows you to wedge your arms and feet in between a series of pillowy slats.

This may help to better facilitate cuddling.

The mattress also comes with specialized fitted sheets, which may help to better facilitate sanitary sleeping conditions.

Mehdi Mojtabavi’s innovation is not yet in production.

The prototype won a 2007 Red Dot award and was a 2008 Industrial Designers Society of America finalist.

Mojtabavi failed to raise £48,000 ($75,000) in start-up money through a crowd-sourced fundraising campaign.

He is currently seeking other investors to get his idea on the market.
