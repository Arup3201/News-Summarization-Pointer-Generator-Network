Just over a month ago, Dieter Gruschwitz dialled Jurgen Klopp’s mobile number, not the first to be quite unsure whether he was about to be deafened with a sonic boom of anger — or to be treated to ‘Kloppo’s’ quick-witted and generous bonhomie.

The programme director of German TV station ZDF needed to make the peace. Klopp had taken umbrage at the ‘stupid question’ of ZDF front-man Jochen Breyer in the aftermath of Real Madrid’s clinical 3-0 destruction of Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League quarter-final first leg.

‘That’s the tie over?’ Breyer asked the notoriously volatile and edgy Dortmund manager.

‘How can I accept my salary this month if I stand here and say that’s us out?’ Klopp reasonably demanded. ‘It’d be just as stupid of me to say we are definitely going to hammer them. I can stand here and give stupid answers to stupid questions but I’m not going to any more,’ Klopp finished before calmly walking off. 

Complex character: Borussia Dortmund's coach Jurgen Klopp did not hold any grudges against the TV station

Gruschwitz discovered that Klopp bore no malice. That he’d ‘forgotten’ about the whole thing.

Two things emerged from the incident. Dortmund roasted Real Madrid 2-0 in the return leg, not taking the tie to extra time for the simple reason that Iker Casillas played miraculously well.

Secondly, that was the low point of a brutally testing season. The 3-0 defeat to a team which the previous season they’d beaten twice, eliminated from the Champions League semi-final and scored a grand total of eight goals against must have felt like the straw which crippled the camel.

Instead it was a point of inflection. They have rallied — winning 3-0 at Bayern 10 days later and qualifying for the German Cup Final next Saturday in Berlin... against Bayern.

Set against the backdrop of sudden disharmony in Munich (Pep Guardiola’s methods under question, an inability to properly value a Bundesliga title won in record time and a 4-0 home thrashing by Madrid in the semi-final second leg) Dortmund are already finishing their season with a more optimistic vibe than seemed possible at any time from September onwards, let alone after the 3-0 Madrid rout.

Klopp admits: ‘It’s been a tremendously difficult season, since the beginning, full of extraordinary challenges and what is, in my experience, an unprecedented injury crisis.

‘But I’ve always said that it’s not necessary for us to be the “best” team in the world, just that we are capable of beating the “best” team in the world.’

His point is well made. Of the 10 most-used Dortmund players in the Bundesliga last term (Marco Reus, Robert Lewandowski, Roman Weidenfeller, Kevin Grosskreutz, Lukasz Piszczek, Marcel Schmelzer, Mario Gotze, Ilkay Gundogan, Mats Hummels and Jakub Blaszczykowski) only five feature in the top 10 this season.

Bad night: Gareth Bale helped Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-0

Of the others, Gotze is gone (to Bayern), Gundogan has effectively missed the season, Piszczek and Blaszczykowski have played fewer than 24 league games between them and mainstay central defender Neven Subotic, 41 matches last season, has played 16 times this.

Add to the mix that, in January, Lewandowski confirmed he’d be moving to Bayern, too — and it’s tough to imagine more hostile working conditions.

Saying his goodbyes: Robert Lewandowski will leave Dortmund this summer

This time last year Klopp was comparing Bayern to ‘a Bond villain’, in which case there were stages this season when Double-0-Kloppo, licensed to lose his temper, was strapped to the lab table and Auric Bayern-Finger’s laser was cutting up close to his nether regions. Shocking.

So, ahead of the big showdown with Smersh next Saturday, how has he coped? Shaken, but not stirred it seems.

Getting better: Dortmund have won more points than last season

Plenty to play for: Dortmund face Bayern in the German Cup final

Dortmund have more points than last season, have conceded fewer Bundesliga goals, came through the hardest Champions League group (Arsenal, Napoli, Marseille), earned around €25million by reaching the quarter-finals, won the German Supercup that they lost to Bayern last term and, if they regain the Cup (from which the super-villains also eliminated them with a back-post goal from Ernst Stavro Blofeld and a toe-poke from Rosa Klebb last season), there will be the double joy of pleasing the 80,000 yellow-and-black clad fanatics who are travelling to the German capital, ticket or no ticket, and ruining Bayern’s summer.

Should his Dortmund side inflict its third win of the season over Guardiola’s Bayern and lift the Cup in Berlin then, who knows, Bond may be asked over to the ‘dark’ side in Munich this summer.

Uncomfortable to think of him saying ‘yes’, isn’t it?

But then, you only live twice.
