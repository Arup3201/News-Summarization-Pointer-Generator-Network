Reassurance: The Prime Minister of Romania Victor Ponta said Britain should not fear an invasion of immigrants from his country

Romania's prime minister has said that the UK does not need to fear an 'invasion' of immigrants because he believes people from his country are better off staying at home.

Victor Ponta said he was 'rather perplexed' by reports in the British press that the UK faces a new wave of eastern European arrivals when EU 'freedom of movement' laws change in 2014.

Writing in The Times newspaper, he said Romanian workers 'will not rush to Britain' because they will be too 'busy developing their own country'.

Romanians and Bulgarians have had restricted rights to come and work in Britain since the two countries joined the European Union in 2007.

But these laws expire on December 31 2013, meaning 29 million people will have the right to live and work in Britain unrestricted.

Experts have warned that a new influx of immigrants - such as was experienced when Poland and other other eastern European countries gained the same rights in 2004 - could harm the job prospects of British people.

Britain is likely to be an attractive option due to the ongoing economic crisis in Europe and increasing employment in the UK.

But Mr Ponta said Britain should not worry because he is introducing a series of policies in Romania which will stimulate growth and strengthen the economy.

He wrote: 'Our people are, by far, our most valuable, cherished and significant resource. And we will do our utmost to keep them in the country.

The Prime Minister also suggested that British people should follow in the footsteps of Prince Charles and visit his country as a tourist destination.

The Prince of Wales is known to have a bought property in rural Transylvania in 2006 and once joked that he is descended from the notorious ruler Vlad the Impaler.

Mr Ponta claimed that Prince Charles took a holiday at his country house after the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations last year.

He said: 'The very day after Queen Elizabeth's Jubilee celebrations, Prince Charles slipped away to Romania for a bit of peace and quiet and a traditional organic meal in a secluded village where he owns a house. Romania can't be that bad, can it?'

He also suggested Chelsea football club's upcoming fixture against Steaua Bucharest as an ideal opportunity for British tourists to visit his country.

The Government has come under pressure after admitting it has no idea how many Romanian or Bulgarian immigrants will come to Britain when the border controls are scrapped.

David Cameron has suggested that new arrivals could be refused access to legal aid, as well as some benefits and healthcare.
