One has marble floors and a chandelier in the bathroom, another has a glorious balcony overlooking its beautiful lawn and a third was featured in a popular cookery television show.

But these amazing houses are not competing against each other - rather their occupants are - as these are the seven homes of six men and one woman running in the Republican presidential race.

Newt Gingrich, Jon Huntsman, Mitt Romney, Rick Perry, Ron Paul, Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum own a wide range of houses which were analysed in a New York Times feature yesterday.

Newt Gingrich: The home of the former House Speaker in McLean, Virginia. His bathroom has many mirrors

Jon Huntsman: The former Utah governor's townhouse in the Kalorama neighbourhood of Washington D.C.

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has a 5,206 sq ft estate built only 24 years ago in McLean, Virginia, and it is notable for its master bathroom which has some impressive features.

The bathroom features a marble floor with a dark granite and gold vanity fitting below brass brackets and a chandelier, while there are decorated windows and many mirrors dotted around.

But House Beautiful editor Newell Turner told the New York Times: ‘His house sits so awkwardly on its site... The lots and the neighbourhood are too tight for such a fidgety house.’

Former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman has a five-bedroom townhouse in Washington D.C., once used by contenders on series seven of Bravo TV show Top Chef, reported the New York Times.

Mitt Romney: The ex-Massachusetts governor's home on Lake Winnipesaukee in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire

Rick Perry: The entrance to the gated community where the Texas Governor has a home near Austin, Texas

Ron Paul: The former home of the Texas Representative, advertised online, is seen in Lake Jackson, Texas

His previous home appeared in Home and Design magazine nine years ago and it was redecorated  in a pattern of red, yellow, fuchsia and blue, while plenty of traditional furniture was placed inside too.

Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney has
 the most houses of all candidates - no surprise given he is by far the 
richest too. His pictured home is on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire.

He has recently sold houses in Belmont, Massachusetts and Park City, Utah, but he also has a beautiful oceanfront home in California as well as the New Hampshire abode, reported the New York Times.

The Romneys’ Belmont house was praised for its creme fabric and curved ceiling in the bathroom, while the Lake Winnipesaukee compound was labelled by its architects as ‘casually comfortable’.

Texas Governor Rick Perry’s gated home in Austin, Texas, boasts five bedrooms, seven baths, three dining rooms and a 1,100 sq ft guest house, reported the New York Times.

The home is worth around $2million and features a balcony overlooking a well-maintained lawn.

Texas Representative Ron Paul put
 his four-bedroom ranch house in Lake Jackson, Texas, on the market by 
creating a website for buyers, which showed its pool surrounded by the 
u-shaped home.

Michele Bachmann: The Minnesota Representative's charming home in Stillwater, Minnesota, is pictured

Rick Santorum: The traditional home of former Pennsylvania senator in Great Falls, Virginia, seen last month

He raised his five children with wife Carol at the home and New York designer Thad Hayes told the New York Times ‘it says family’, thanks in part to the pool floats seen strewn around the place.

Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann bought a house in 2008 for $760,000 in West Lakeland Township, Minnesota, which was built a year earlier for a charity construction project.

It was in fact originally listed at $1.75million so it appears she got quite a bargain for the home, which features a sunroom, breakfast room and large living room, reported the New York Times.

Former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum has the most traditional of all the houses and his  Great Falls, Virginia, abode is designed in a 1970s colonial style. It cost him $2million in 2007.
