Cristiano Ronaldo has joined up with his Real Madrid team-mates in the USA as he began pre-season training on Monday. 

It was his first day back following a disappointing World Cup campaign that saw him score just a single goal as Portugal exited at the group stage.

He was greeted by hundreds of fans at their LA training base before undergoing what looked like a light session separate to the rest of the squad.VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo meets Del Piero and his son
