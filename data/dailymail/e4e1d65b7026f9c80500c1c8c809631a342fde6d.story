These are the first photographs of former call girl Ashley Dupré's adorable baby girl taken on Thursday as she visited her own clothing store.

Izabel Jagger Earle was born at Jersey Shore Medical Center on November 10, 2012 at 4.11pm and is the 27-year-old's first child. The baby girl, whose father is Dupré's fiancé TJ Earle, weighed 7lbs and was 21 inches.

Miss Dupré visited her store, Femme by Ashley which sells swimwear and lingerie, with her daughter on Thursday afternoon in Red Bank, New Jersey.

The new mother dropped by in her Mercedes and popped inside carrying Izabel with an $1,100 Gucci diaper bag slung over one shoulder.

Two-month-old Izabel looked sweet in pale pink onesie with a matching hat. Miss Dupré looked slender two months after giving birth in a pair of tight jeans, knee-high brown boots, fitted white shirt and gray cardigan.

The escort-turned-businesswoman battled the sub-zero temperatures on the East Coast by layering up in a pristine white coat, $400 Gucci scarf and accessorized with aviator sunglasses.

The 27-year-old was also sporting a huge rock on her finger that customers at her store began noticing last summer.

The attention-grabbing bling 
suggested that Earle, who left his wife for the former escort, had 
proposed and a wedding was still in the works.

A close friend told MailOnline: 'Izabel is one of the best things that's ever happened to Ashley.

'She is so in love with her. Nothing means more to her than her little family. She feels very lucky.'

Ashley Dupré is the call girl most famous for bedding former New York governor Eliot Spitzer.

Dupré's affair with Spitzer - who became known as 'Client No 9' - led him to resign after just 14 months in office.

A stint as a relationship advice columnist for the New York Post and a spread in Playboy followed the scandal for the mother-to-be.

She has recently transformed herself into a lingerie and swimwear specialist with a small boutique. Miss Dupré's book of sex tips was also published today.

'Tricks of the Trade: Advice on Sex,
Love, and Lust,’ was released on Thursday by the New York Post. The 
resident Post ‘sexpert's book is comprised of her ‘Ask Ashley’ columns,
written between 2008 and 2012.

The eBook, among other things, boasts chapters about relationships, fetishes, cheating and family drama.

Dupré and Mr Earle began an illicit 
affair shortly after news of her dealings with Mr Spitzer hit the 
headlines but the asphalt heir was still married to wife Alisa with whom
he has two children.

After meeting at a Jersey Shore restaurant, Mr Earle had reportedly boasted to a friend: 'I could have had her for free.'

When their steamy affair was exposed later, the Earle Companies executive publicly apologized to his wife calling his actions a 'grave mistake'.

Ms Dupre meanwhile, went on to make a
name for herself, this time as a New York Post advice columnist, fielding 
questions from readers on sex and relationships and being commended by 
many for her bravery in speaking out about her experience.

In
a final piece for the column, to which she contributed for 
two-and-a-half years, she said: 'I'm proud to say that Ask Ashley has 
been a greater success then I ever thought.

'Not a financial one, but rather a success in letting people see that I'm more than just the girl in the headlines from 2008.'

When
Mr Spitzer was accused of paying Ms Dupre $2,000 for sex at a 
Washington hotel the night before Valentine's Day in 2008, a can of 
worms was opened that revealed the governor's long time penchant for 
expensive call girls and culminated in his resignation
