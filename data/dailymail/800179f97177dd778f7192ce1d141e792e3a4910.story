A former Chelsea footballer is being investigated by police after sending abusive messages on Twitter about glamour model Danielle Lloyd.

Leon Knight, 29, had an argument through the social network last week with Miss Lloyd's husband, Wolverhampton Wanderers footballer Jamie O'Hara, with whom the model has two children.

A spokesman for Staffordshire Police confirmed to MailOnline that they are looking into the matter after they received a report of malicious communications.

A spokesman said: 'We are aware of the incident and are dealing with it along with Thames Valley Police.'

O'Hara, 
25, was incensed after Knight, 29, tweeted to him: 'You're married correct
!! But ur married to a raging s**t bag [sic]'

Knight followed up the comment with many other accusations relating to 
Danielle's past, insinuating that she'd played the field with many other
footballers in her time.

O'Hara wrote: 'If at 
@leonknight82 has got a problem he should give me a call instead of 
giving the bigun on twitter to a women with two kids.

He added: 'To
all people asking me about Leon knight this is now in the hands of the 
police and my lawyers, jealousy is the the route to all evil.'

Clearly upset, Danielle later 
took to her own page and wrote: 'Sadly I might be coming off twitter as I
can't take much more abuse from scum when all am trying to do is be a 
good mum & wife I love all[sic].'

After a series of tweets with his opinions on women, Leon Knight turned to footballer Jamie O'Hara's marriage

Knight began to make slurs against Danielle Lloyd, who is married to Wolverhampton Wanderers' O'Hara

Danielle Lloyd sent one tweet in response to Knight's messages

However, Danielle later changed 
her mind about shutting down her Twitter account.

The investigation into Knight's Twitter comments comes as prominent celebrities have spoken out about personal attacks aimed at their accounts and police begin to crack down on online abuse.

Stuart Hyde, chief constable of 
Cumbria and the Association of Chief Police Officers spokesman on social
media, said earlier this week: ‘Social media is increasingly part of police business and 
the law covers situations where you have comment that goes way beyond 
legitimate opinion.

'We don’t just deal with people who are famous. People have the right to freedom of speech but it has to be within the law.’

Under the Malicious Communications 
Act 1988, any 'indecent or grossly offensive' message that causes 
'distress or anxiety' to the recipient can lead to prosecution. 

The maximum punishment is a fine not exceeding level four on the standard scale - i.e. no more than £2,500.

Yesterday BBC presenter Gary Lineker said he felt 'physically sick' at Twitter abuse sent to his 20-year-old son George about his childhood battle with leukaemia.

A user by the name @MrMarkDRUMS711 sent George Lineker a tweet which read: '@GeorgeLineker heard ya Leukaemia, pity ya didn't die.'

Further tweets from the user, who has since deleted his account, attacked George's famous father and thanked him for retweeting the original abusive message.

Another BBC star, Blue Peter presenter Helen Skelton quit the micro-blogging site yesterday after tweets sent to her regarding her part in the Olympics coverage.

She wrote: 'Turns out I don’t have very thick skin after all so I am closing my twitter account. Enjoy the games. Signing off, skelts x.'

Television presenter Kirstie Allsopp reported two 15-year-old girls to police for tweets they sent to her, while The Only Way is Essex's Maria Fowler has started a Twitter petition to 'target the trolls'.

Earlier this week, a 17-year-old boy was issued with a formal harassment warning by Dorset Police after tweeting diver Tom Daley to tell him his late father Rob would be disappointed in his Olympics synchronised diving performance.

Reece Messer is on police bail, but he 
could still face up to six months in prison for offences under the 
Malicious Communications Act after officers said they were investigating
the rest of his Twitter account.

Shortly after receiving the message, Daley retweeted a message from user Rileyy69 which said: 'You let your dad down i hope you know that.'

Daley responded by tweeting: 'After giving it my all... you get idiots sending me this...'

Daley’s father Rob died last year from brain cancer.

The Twitter user Rileyy_69 made a serious of insulting comments about Daley, including a claim that he would drown the superstar teenager. It is believed this tweet resulted in his arrest.

In April a 60-year-old man was convicted of sending abusive messages to Tory MP Louise Mensch, telling her to stop using Twitter and threatening children.

A 21-year-old student was jailed for 56 days in March for inciting racial hatred after sending offensive tweets in the wake of Bolton Wanderers player Fabrice Muamba's heart attack on the pitch in a game against Spurs.

Swansea student Liam Stacey tweeted a series of messages as medics attended Muamba on the pitch, saying: 'LOL (laugh out loud). **** Muamba. He's dead!!!'

Around the same time Newcastle University law student, Joshua Cryer, also 21, was given a two-year community order after admitting sending racist Twitter messages to  England footballer-turned-pundit Stan Collymore.
