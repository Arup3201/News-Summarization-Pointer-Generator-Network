A former executive at a New York investor firm has been sentenced to 2½ years in prison for insider trading ran through a gamut of excuses for his behavior before sentencing, going so far as to tell the judge that he only did cocaine because he couldn't drink coffee.  

Federal Judge Jesse Furman sentenced Michael Lucarelli on Wednesday in Manhattan. 

He urged Lucarelli to deal with anger he directs at others.

'I didn't take the drugs to get high, I did it because I can’t drink coffee — that’s a painful trip to the bathroom,' he said.

Federal Judge Jesse Furman sentenced Michael Lucarelli (pictured in September 2014) to two-and-a-half years in prison on Wednesday in Manhattan after Lucarelli spent almost 20 years recounting struggles with drugs, impotence, family problems, and abandonment by friends

The Daily News reports that it was Crohn's disease that was responsible for his discomfot. 

'He turned to it for the pain caused by Crohn’s disease, and working long hours — it gave him a little pep,' his attorney, Patrick McGinley, told reporters.

The disgraced investor also admitted to struggles with impotence and a painful family history, claiming he had become a 'leper' to all his former friends. 

Before Furman spoke, a tearful Lucarelli said he hoped to sue investor relations firm Lippert/Heilshorn & Associates Inc., claiming it cheated him on commissions.

He was also ordered to forfeit $955,521.62, the exact amount he was accused of having illegally earned

The judge rejected his explanation that he turned to crime because he felt bosses cheated him.

When Lucarelli was first arrested in August, he ran out of his sandals as he fled photographers. His behavior earned him a mocking on a segment of 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.'

He was also ordered to forfeit $955,521.62, the exact amount he was accused of having illegally earned.

Lucarelli said he will sue his former bosses in response. 

'The only problem I had in my 25-year career was when these people started to steal my commissions!' he said. 

Though now penniless and abandoned by his wife, he says he is now living in North Dakota with a brother.

He'd like to become a truck driver.

Though now penniless and abandoned by his wife, he told the court he was now living in North Dakota with a brother and planned to become a truck driver 

'The one thing about trucking, you’re urine tested all the time,” he said. 'If you’re a good driver, which I am, they don’t care about insider trading.'

A previously released sentencing memo said he expects 'to be licensed and to drive tractor trailers', according to the New York Daily News.

It also said he 'will never again trade another stock or work in any stock related field'.

His statements have changed little since his case gained hit the spotlight. 

In a September hearing he described his crime to U.S. District Judge Jesse M. Furman, Lucarelli apologized and paused briefly to cry.

He had used non-public information from drafts of press releases to earn nearly a million dollars.

He said long hours at Manhattan-based investor relations firm Lippert/Heilshorn & Associates Inc., where he was director of market intelligence, his failure to take vacation for two years and complications from Crohn's disease that led to a dependence on  cocaine, were in part to blame for his illegal trading over the last year.

He said commissions for his work sometimes were not paid in a timely manner.

'Fueled by anger at not getting paid and a dependence on drugs, I made a serious mistake,' Lucarelli said. He added that it was the first time he had run afoul of the law in his quarter of a century in the business.

'I apologize to the court for my decision to trade on material nonpublic information,' he said. 'I wasn't strong enough to resist. I'm very remorseful.'

The judge asked several questions about the trades he carried out in the securities of 13 of the firm's clients.

'Because of the physical pain and the dependence on drugs, I can't remember,' he said in one answer.
