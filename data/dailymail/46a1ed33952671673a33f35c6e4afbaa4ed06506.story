While plain, wooden, gender-neutral dollhouses have been available through boutique toy makers for some years, it seems that mass market retailers are finally catching on.

Lisa Wade, a professor of sociology at Occidental College, looked into the girl-orientated toy in lieu of the holiday season, and found a surprising number of Toys R Us dollhouses veered away from  heteronormative stereotypes, and instead 'had themes of friendship and, dare I say, female-independence.'

Writing for Jezebel, she said: 'These houses had only women or, more often, a group of women and one man. They gave the impression of female home-ownership and female dominated social interaction.'

Gender roles: Furnished dollhouses, like this one by Moolka, $184.99, started a movement toward mass market gender-neutral dollhouses

Dollhouses today are considered 'girly' and therefore a 'gender issue' because toy marketers have long sent pink-filled messages that they are a girls-only role playing device.

However, as many parents know, both boys and girls play with dollhouses and acquire different lessons from the experience.

While a girl may put a mother in the kitchen, and a boy may mow the imaginary lawn, or vice versa, children often role-play what they see their parents doing, and other families in their community doing.

The need to role-play will be expressed
 whether it is through a dollhouse, playing dress-up, a kitchen play 
set, or stuffed animals; and big toy companies like Toys R Us and Costco
 are beginning to realise that this includes both genders - not just 
girls whose favourite colour is pink.

Not just for girls: KidKraft® Everyday Heroes Wooden Police & Fire Playset, recently available at Costco, is a step forward in accepting that boys are also interested in role-playing with a dollhouse

Female domination: Barbie Malibu Dreamhouse, available at Toys R Us, $129.99, features a group of women and one man - giving the impression of female home-ownership and female dominated social interaction

Costco recently released a fireman-themed dollhouse, which while not gender-neutral, is a step forward in accepting that boys are also interested in role-playing with a dolls house. It also sells large, durable, unpainted wooden dolls houses 'so multiple children can play at the same time,' and create their own world within it.

Ms Wade wrote: 'Among the 22 bestselling dollhouses at Toys R Us, four came without people, six came with a preponderance of females, ten came with a male, female, and children, and there were two I couldn't categorize. (All humans were white - some dollhouses included non-human creatures - and just about everyone appears to be wealthy.)'

She added: 'Interestingly, most of the dollhouses that ... gave the impression of female home-ownership and female dominated social interaction, were Barbie affiliated.

'People disagree as to whether Barbie is a good role model for young women.  She is roundly criticized for upholding a harmful standard of beauty, but she also tells women they can run for President and go to the moon. 

'In this case, Barbie is sending girls the message that they can have fulfilling lives and own homes without a husband.'

However some parents actually see gender-specific dollhouses that perpetuate stereotypical gender roles as irrelevant.

One commenter wrote: 'If you want your kids to have alternative models of gender roles, you achieve that by modeling them as their parents, not giving them gender-neutral models to play with.
