A 14-year-old who was arrested on suspicion of raping an 8-year-old girl on Thursday is the younger brother of another minor who was conivcted earlier this year of raping two teenage women.

The teen was arrested on Thursday after an 8-year-old girl showed up to a Red Lion Inn & Suites in Kent, Washington wearing only a t-shirt and socks, saying a boy she recognized from her neighborhood raped her.

The 14-year-old has not yet been named because he is a minor and police have not formally charged him yet. Charges are expected by next Wednesday.

While they have different last names, the 14-year-old is the younger brother of convicted rapist Chrisean Cressel who was 15 when he raped two young women on consecutive nights in October 2011.

Cressel plead guilty to both first-degree rape counts and was convicted this past January. He is serving an indeterminate prison sentence of 20 years to life in prison.

Cressel's younger brother is accused of seeking out the 8-year-old and luring her 'under false pretenses' to a wooded area to 'show her a surprise'.

Student: The unnamed 14-year-old was a student at Kent Meridian High School

When they got there he raped her and seems to have brutally beat her.

Police believe she was beaten unconscious after she suffered a concussion and abrasions in the attack.

'This is definitely outside the norm, by far,' King County Senior Deputy Prosecutor Michael Mohandeson told the Seattle Times.

Prosecutors had similar things to say about Cressel's crime.

He raped a 19-year-old woman and 17-year-old girl on back to back nights in October 2011 after following them from their bus stops. He threatened to shoot both.

'It is extremely rare to see an offender this young become a predatory serial rapist,' King County Posecutor Dan Sattenberg said when Cressel was sentenced.
