Rickie Lambert has been holding court for eight minutes, discussing how his dreams have been made real, when he makes a conscious decision.

His £4m move from Southampton to Liverpool has been one of the stories of the summer, given it provided an unexpected opportunity for him to return to where it all began; the romance of a journey that began with heartbreak 17 years earlier coming full circle was there for all to see.

Lambert is beaming as he sits in a meeting room in the plush Four Seasons Hotel, Liverpool’s base here in Boston, talking about how he is settling in when, in a flash, his tone changes and he takes a pin to the nostalgia and sentiment that has surrounded him.

On the pitch: Lambert says his performances  for Southampton in recent seasons prove he is a worthy buy

‘I know a lot of Liverpool fans like the idea of signing a Scouser and a Liverpudlian but the move had no sentiment about it,’ said Lambert, who has been entrusted with iconic No 9 shirt. ‘Football has no place for sentimental things. It’s about what I do on the pitch, it’s as simple as that.

‘It’s a good story and I’m happy talking about it but the time has gone past that now. The first game of the season is coming and believe me when I say it that is all I am focusing on. I want to get myself in the best shape possible. I know when I am fully fit, that is when you will see the best of me.

‘There are more signings to come, which is great for the club, but there is already a great squad here. You see the depth and quality and with a couple more signings, we are only going to be stronger.’

His words are as timely as they are wise. While it is clear the emotion surrounding this transfer is far removed from the vast majority of other deals, Lambert is smart to point out Brendan Rodgers did not sign him to be an on-field cheerleader - he was brought in to make a difference.

This, after all, will be a hectic season for Liverpool, one that sees them return to the Champions League for the first time since 2009, and expectation will abound after they came within two points of winning the Barclays Premier League and Rodgers simply cannot afford to carry passengers.

Determined characters like Lambert are what he needs. Those traits have been present ever since he was released by then Academy Director Steve Heighway in 1997, enabling him to climb the football pyramid, from the days when he was working in a beetroot factory to subside his fledgling career.

‘I’ll be honest - my career has been so long and been down so many different roads, I would be lying if I said that I had it in the back of my mind that I would ever return,’ said Lambert, who has played for, among others, Blackpool, Macclesfield and Bristol Rovers.

'It wasn’t a shock when I got released. I wasn’t one of the better ones in my group (Steven Warnock and Kevin Nolan were peers). I had only just been kept on six months earlier. I knew I was having to prove my place and keep working, so it didn’t really come as a surprise when they let me go.

‘When I look back, it was probably silly how much it hurt me because I was absolutely devastated. I was 15 and it felt like the end of the world. It was as simple as that.

‘I’m 32 so the days of just being happy when I’m playing have gone. I’m looking at the bigger picture. It’s whatever is best for the club. Of course I don’t want to be on the bench and not play games but as long as I can see the manager appreciates me and my ability then I’m happy to do whatever.

‘I didn’t ask for any number. I was happy to be given any number. It is a special number and I was made up when they said you’re number 9. That [points to LFC badge] is what means the most to me. Any number with that on, I’ll be happy with it.’

With that, the beaming smile returns. Lambert will take another step towards gaining full fitness when Liverpool face Roma in the early hours of Thursday morning in Fenway Park and there is no doubt the enthusiasm he has for the club will improve his chances of seamlessly fitting in.

‘My first reaction at the time (when my agent rang) was something along the lines of “get lost”,’ said Lambert, referring to the phone call that turned his world upside down in May. ‘I didn't believe him at first. When I got out of bed properly and listened I realised it was genuine.

‘But now I have to get picked, progress with the club and impress the manager. That’s what matters. Obviously when I look back over my career I’ll never forget my time at all my clubs who mean a lot to me, but I’m thinking I have to think about what I do from now.’
