Lancashire’s Simon Kerrigan remains in England’s thoughts

Peter Moores has challenged Monty Panesar to sort out his attitude as England’s new-look side continue their search for a  front-line spinner.

With Graeme Swann no longer on the scene and with Panesar out of favour, Alastair Cook’s team had to settle for 16 wicketless overs of  part-time off-spin from Moeen Ali and Joe Root on Monday as they narrowly failed to dismiss Sri Lanka on the final day of the first Investec Test at Lord’s.

‘We are going to have to identify our next spinner, there’s no doubt about that,’ said England coach Moores. ‘Especially when we go away, otherwise it is going to be a weakness in our ranks that people will try to exploit.

‘Monty is the most experienced Test bowler out there, but through other issues he has made it difficult to look at him at the moment. The key for Monty is to bowl well and get his things right, and then put himself up for selection like anyone else.

‘There are two things: people have to be in the right place to play from an attitudinal point of view, but also they have to be playing well enough.’

Lancashire’s slow left-armer Simon Kerrigan remains in England’s thoughts, and there are high hopes for Kent’s 22-year-old off-spinner Adam Riley.

Panesar, though, remains the classiest option. His 50 Tests have brought him 167 wickets and, at 32, he ought to be in his prime.

His form with Essex is not an immediate 
concern: he has 22 Championship wickets this summer at 29 apiece. But he
 was dropped for the Championship game against Glamorgan at the start of
 the month after forgetting to turn up for a team meeting.

That followed a warning from Essex about his body language earlier in the season, and a row with Derbyshire’s Billy Godleman.

Last summer, Panesar was given a wide berth by England after urinating on nightclub bouncers in Brighton.

Meanwhile, Cook has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee after England were deemed to have fallen one over short of the required rate for the Lord’s Test.
