Her family had made the devastating decision to turn off her life support machine.

But just four hours before it was due to be switched off, a 'miracle' happened.

Press conference: 'She just magically woke up. Literally four hours before we moved to take her off life support,' her overjoyed son, Ryan (pictured), said of the incident, which happened on December 22 last year

'She just magically woke up. Literally four hours before we moved to take her off life support,' her overjoyed son, Ryan Roberts, said of the incident, which happened on December 22 last year.

However, Mrs Roberts's awakening was bittersweet. She quickly became aware that she faced the unimaginable question: Did she want to live without her hands and feet?' 

The rare and sudden bacterial infection - initially mistaken for the flu  - had left her with no choice but to agree to the amputation of her four limbs in order to survive, Live Well Nebraska reported.

But incredibly, Mrs Roberts has embraced her life-changing future. She has not let her loss of limbs prevent her from fussing over her family - and she even plans to walk and drive again.

'I gave up on my mom, and she didn't give up on herself,' Ryan said, explaining how he and his family had been given the choice to amputate his mother's limbs or pull the plug and let her slip away.

They had all opted to turn off the life support machine, he said. This way, Mrs Roberts would be able to be reunited with her daughter, Andrea Kruger, 33, who was brutally murdered in 2013, in heaven.

Mrs Roberts's story was revealed on Thursday at a press conference. Her son, joined by Dr Patrick McCarville, of Methodist Physicians Clinic, decided to go public following numerous media inquiries.

During the conference, Ryan revealed his mother fell ill with what she believed was the flu on December 12. However, her condition quickly deteriorated and she soon ended up in intensive care.

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a rare, potentially deadly medical condition caused by a bacterial infection. 

Although it has been linked to tampon use in women, the condition can affect men, children, and people of all ages.

Sufferers are typically infected when bacteria enters their body through an opening in their skin, such as through a cut or wound.    

Symptoms of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome tend to appear suddenly and may be attributed to other illnesses, such as the flu.

They include a sudden fever, low blood pressure, a headache, muscle aches, confusion, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, a rash, redness of eyes and seizures.

For doctors, patients with the syndrome are medical emergencies. According to the National Institutes of Health, the condition is deadly in half of cases.

There, she was diagnosed with Group A streptococcus, which led to toxic shock syndrome - a condition caused by bacteria and typically associated with younger woman and the use of tampons.

It is not known where or how Mrs Roberts contracted the bacteria. Shortly after her admission to hospital, the grandmother-of-five fell into a coma. Her condition steadily worsened, according to Omaha World-Herald.

Her limbs turned black and developed gangrene, her face often contorted in pain, blisters started to erupt all over her body and her kidneys and liver began to fail. She was placed on dialysis. 

'Most people don't live into it as long as Teri did,' said Dr McCarville during the conference. 

On December 21, doctors were convinced that there was no hope and delivered the news to Mrs Roberts's friends and family, according to a GoFundMe page set up to help her with her recovery.

They gave her relatives a choice: Amputate her limbs or remove the ventilator and let her slip away in a hospice. After hours of emotion-fueled talks, Ryan and his father, Kent, decided to pull the plug.

During the conference, Ryan explained how the pair had weighed up the possibility of his mother remaining in a coma forever, and how she would feel about living a life as a quadruple amputee.

However, just hours before they planned to turn off her ventilator and move her into a hospice, Mrs Roberts awoke, the New York Daily News reported. And she wanted to live. 

Ryan said he had been told the incredible news via a call from his father. 'He said, "Mom woke up. She doesn't want to be with Andrea yet. She doesn't care if she loses her hands and feet",' he said.

The 35-year-old added: 'It was, by far, the best Christmas gift I've ever had.'

In subsequent days, Mrs Roberts had her hands amputated a few inches above the wrists, while her feet were removed six to eight inches below the knee after  her body refused to reclaim any tissue.

Now, she is on the long road to recovery. She will shortly be transferred from hospital to a rehabilitation center, where she will embark on a rigorous program to rebuild her strength.

And despite the challenges ahead of her, Mrs Roberts is determined to push through.

'She says she will walk again and she will drive,' Ryan  said, adding that she often has moments of frustration, such as reaching out to grab something and realizing she has no hands.

According to the GoFundMe page, Mrs Roberts 'is working her way back'. It states: 'Teri has gone from feeding thru IV’s to eating small bites of hamburger which helped increase her strength.

'She’s regained liver and kidney function and her body has continued to heal. Teri’s response to [her amputations] was, “I’m just letting the other people ﬁnally catch up to me!”

Fundraising: Mrs Roberts's family is now raising money to cover her costly medical bills. They have already raised nearly $18,000 of their $25,000 target. Above, the GoFundMe page that has been set up for Mrs Roberts

'Her strength, determination and zest for life are simply inspiring. Teri has a long road ahead of her, yet her spirit is awesome! When you walk into her hospital room you’re greeted with a huge smile.

'She believes that everything happens for a reason and we just don’t know what it is yet. Teri is now in physical therapy and will soon head to rehab and will be ﬁtted for her prosthetics.'
