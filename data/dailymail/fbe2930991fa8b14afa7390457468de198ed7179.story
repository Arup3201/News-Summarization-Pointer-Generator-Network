Holland and Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has told his star striker Robin van Persie that he will be sacrificed if he isn’t fit enough or playing well enough.

Van Gaal and his captain Van Persie are thought to have a unique bond that United fans will hope can be replicated when the veteran coach starts life at Old Trafford after the World Cup.

But Van Gaal hauled Van Persie off 15 minutes from the end of Sunday night’s dramatic 2-1 win over Mexico and watched as his replacement Klaas-Jan Huntelaar set up one goal and score the winner from the penalty spot.

Afterwards, Van Gaal was asked if Van Persie was injured and said: 'No. The substitution of Van Persie was tactical.

'Let’s not forget before he joined team he was recovering from an injury. It’s difficult for him to keep up 90 minutes especially in these conditions.

'Anyway, this trainer wants to win. So he makes the changes and the substitutions he needs. It’s simple. Nothing else matters.'

Van Persie is still expected to start in Saturday’s quarter-final against Costa Rica but holding midfielder Nigel de Jong is not expected to recover from the groin injury that forced him off the field early on in the Mexico game.

'I don’t know but I think it might be difficult,' added Van Gaal. It is a muscle injury.'

Van Gaal has denied that his team have a straight forward route to the last four, even though quarter-final opponents Costa Rica are ranked 28 in the world and had to play extra time against Greece yesterday.

'Let me tell you the Dutch media thought we would never survive the first round, so how we ended up becoming up favourites, I’ll never know,' he said.

'This group of players is very modest. We have outstanding spirit, outstanding atmosphere, and that led to victory.

'Costa Rica very difficult opponents, otherwise they wouldn’t have ended up in a quarter final.'
