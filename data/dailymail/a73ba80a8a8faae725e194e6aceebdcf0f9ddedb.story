UFC legend and former middleweight champion Anderson Silva has tested positive for anabolic steroids during a random out-of-competition test in the lead-up to his victory over Nick Diaz.

Brazilian Silva, 39, regarded by many to be the best MMA fighter in history, was found to have Drostanolone metabolites in his system after tests administered by the Nevada State Athletic Commission on January 9, the UFC confirmed. 

His opponent Diaz will face a hearing on February 17, the UFC stated, after testing positive for marijuana metabolites after the same fight, won by a unanimous points decision as part of UFC 183 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

The UFC confirmed the initial findings of Silva's test in a statement on their website: 'On February 3, 2015, the UFC organization was notified by the Nevada State Athletic Commission that Anderson Silva tested positive for Drostanolone metabolites on his January 9 out of competition drug test.

'UFC's understanding is that further testing will be conducted by the Commission to confirm these preliminary results.

'Anderson Silva has been an amazing champion and a true ambassador of the sport of mixed martial arts and the UFC, in Brazil as well as around the world. UFC is disappointed to learn of these initial results.

'The UFC has a strict, consistent policy against the use of any illegal and/or performance enhancing drugs, stimulants or masking agents by its athletes.'

It is the first time in Silva's 18-year, 34-victory career, that he has tested positive for a banned substance. Silva has previously campaigned for a lifetime ban for performance-enhancing drug users.

Results of subsequent January 19 tests are pending although an in-competition test on the day of the Diaz fight is reportedly clear.

NAC executive director Bob Bennett also told mmafighting.com that traces of androstane, also a banned substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency's rules, were found in Silva's January 9 tests. 

'I think it's very unfortunate,' Bennett told Ariel Helwani of MMAFighting.com. 'The UFC have made a tremendous effort to level the playing field in their fight against PEDs.'

The NSAC said the fight between Silva and Diaz was not cancelled because results of the positive tests were not made available until  Tuesday morning in the United States.

The UFC also confirmed Diaz's positive test in this statement: ''The UFC has been notified by the Nevada State Athletic Commission that Nick Diaz has tested positive for marijuana metabolites following his fight with Anderson Silva at UFC 183 on January 31 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

'As a result of his positive test, Diaz has been informed that he has violated the UFC Fighter Conduct Policy and Promotional Agreement with Zuffa, LLC. The UFC organization will fully respect the Commission's decision relating to Diaz at a hearing set for February 17.'

This is the third time Diaz has tested positive for drugs related to marijuana - he previously served bans of six months and one year.
