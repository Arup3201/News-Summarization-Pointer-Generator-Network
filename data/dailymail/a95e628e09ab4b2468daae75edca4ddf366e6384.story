Tragic: Gertrude Donaldson, 92, died after being struck by a reversing van as she navigated her way across a car park filled with potholes and 'unclear' road markings

The owners of a car park where a great grandmother was killed by a reversing van as she tried to avoid a pothole have been fined £145,000.

Gertrude Donaldson, a retired nurse who served in India during the Second World War, was walking around numerous potholes and 'unclear' road markings when she was hit by the vehicle.

Following an investigation, it emerged the car park firm in Kendal, Cumbria, had been warned a year earlier but failed to carry out repairs.

And today the company, Jaymar Estates, was found guilty of breaching health and safety guidelines.

'There was a clear and obvious danger,' said Nicholas Johnson QC, prosecuting. 'The death of Mrs Donaldson was the result of the failures identified.'

Mrs Donaldson, of Kendal, had been walking back from the doctors' surgery on October 28, 2009, when she was struck by the van.

Carlisle Crown Court heard she had been attempting to cross Station Road car park but was waylaid by fencing, potholes and road markings.

The incident came a year after Jaymar Estates was advised by a contractor to lay tarmac over the holes and repaint the markings.

'It was greatly foreseeable,' said Judge 
Peter Hughes QC. 'This was an important car park in a busy town centre, 
close to Kendal railway station. The state of the car park had been a 
cause for concern for over a year.'

Action against Manchester-based Jaymar Estates was brought by South Lakeland District Council.

Company directors and brothers, Mordecai and Jacob Halpern, and Howard Frankel, director of another of Jaymar’s sister companies, had previously denied any responsibility for the accident.

However, in court on Monday, they 
pleaded guilty on behalf of the company to a charge of exposing people 
to health and safety risks.

They were fined £95,000, with £50,000 costs.

The court was told that spaces on the car park were leased out by Jaymar Estates to other organisations, including the GP surgery, the Royal British Legion, and the Riverside Hotel.

Keith Morten QC, in mitigation for 
Jaymar, said in the months before the accident, the Riverside Hotel had 
installed fencing around what it perceived to be its own spaces, causing
 further difficulties on the site.

These were not removed until several months after Mrs Donaldson’s death.

However, Jaymar employed a marshall to patrol the site and this later prevented a ‘near-miss’. The necessary remedial work was carried out in 2010.

'These are men of deeply-held religious conviction,' added Mr Morten. 'In the Jewish faith, family is of utmost importance. They understand full well the heartbreak caused by the loss of a loved one.'

After the hearing, Mrs Donaldson’s family said they were ‘happy’ with the message the fine sent out.

'Prior to mum’s death issues about safety in the car park had already been raised with Jaymar.

'On the day of her death, she chose to walk to the surgery because it was a nice day, a reasonable distance for her to walk, which shows how well she was.

'She was the head of a large family and to have her snatched away from us like that was a real shock that will live with us forever.

'We are just grateful now that we have this conclusion and hope this will serve as a reminder to companies about their responsibilities for the health and safety of the public.'

Mrs Donaldson, known to friends and family as Babs, had eight children, 15 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
