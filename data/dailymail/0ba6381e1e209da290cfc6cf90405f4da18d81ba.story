Cesc Fabregas celebrated his first goal in a Chelsea shirt as Jose Mourinho's men eased to victory in their pre-season friendly against Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem.

Diego Costa supplied Mohamed Salah for the first after three minutes.

The Spain striker was later involved in a heated exchange with Vitesse captain Guram Kashia. But he composed himself to lay on a second-half assist for Nemanja Matic.

Host commentator

It's all over in Holland as Chelsea win the game 3-1 thanks to goals from Salah, Fabregas and Matic. 

Costa stood out once again as he bagged two assists while Petr Cech laid down a marker as Thibaut Courtois watched on.

Cesc Fabregas will be pleased to get off the mark in a blue shirt after a delightful 25-yard free-kick put the Blues 2-0 ahead in the first half.

And the home side have a late consolation goal as Djurdjevic finds space in the box to head past Beeney.  

84mins: Torres is still toiling away at the top, but can't get onto a through ball from Boga. The Chelsea youngsters are on now and have been keeping the ball well. Six minutes to play!

81mins: That ends a brilliant night for Costa, who had a hand in all three goals - setting up two and winning the free-kick which Fabregas hit home.

79mins: More changes for Chelsea as Costa, Cahill and Matic make way for Boga, Zouma and Solanke. 

Fabregas has also left the field and Baker gets in on the action

And now Matic has his first goal in a Chelsea shirt after another brilliant bit of play from Costa. Vitesse's defence was nowhere to be seen as Costa burst through before laying the ball off to his right for Matic to do the rest.

72mins: Van Ginkel is getting some (hopefully) precautionary treatment on the right knee that he injured so badly last season. Shouldn't be anything to worry about for Chelsea fans.   

Mike Dickson: On comes the wonderfully named Marvelous Nakamba, who has just signed for Vitesse after a trial.

Marvelous Nakamba is from Zimbabwe, a country which once had a tennis player called Genius Ndzwike (he wasn’t).

66mins: Former Vitesse star Van Ginkel makes way for Oriol Romeu. The Dutch youngster gets a huge reception from the home fans

The Dutch side have rung the change now as both Chelsea loanees, Traore and Wallace, leave the field. 

61mins: Labyad hits the crossbar for Vitesse with a spectacular 30-yard effort from out in the left wing. Cech, who has been brilliant, could have done nothing about that strike. 

58mins: Costa should have just put Chelsea into a 3-0 after running through on goal, but substitute keeper Velthuizen was equal to his left-footed strike. The ball rebounded back out to Torres who couldn't quite turn the ball back towards goal.   

55mins: Costa has moved over to the left in what seems to be a move to get Torres into the game and give the Spaniard a chance to shine in his rightful position.

Costa, however, is still seeing more of the ball as he chests down yet another crossfield pass from Ivanovic. 

54mins: Jose Mourinho calls to Chelsea midfielder and says, 'Matic, control the ball' as he demands that his side start to dictate play once again. 

50mins: There was a counter-attack on for Chelsea as Torres galloped forward but the striker over-hit his pass to Salah and the chance was missed.

Mike Dickson: Didier Drogba reappeared after half time with a baseball cap on back to front saying ‘Sorry I’m Fresh’. Not bad for 36.

We're back underway in Holland as Chelsea go on the attack with Fernando Torres. That's right... he is playing! 

The attack comes to nothing as the Spaniard is blocked. 

No wholesale changes for Chelsea, but John Terry will come on in place of Filipe Luis meaning Cesar Azpilicueta will go out to left-back for the second half.

Mike Dickson: The close relationship between these clubs is the subject of much conjecture but this has been pretty competitive and there could have been more goals. Salah could have scored a hat-rick but has faded after a bright start, Torres anonymous.

Costa formidable. Player who has caught the eye from Vitesse is attacking midfielder Kelvin Leerdam. You doubt this will stay 2-0.

And that's the end of the first half as it ends 2-0 to the Blues. Chelsea have been excellent going forward as goals from Mo Salah and Cesc Fabregas put Jose Mourinho's side in the driving seat.

44mins: Chelsea loanee Wallace goes down after a tackle from Luis, but there was no foul there.

The Brazilian defender grabbed his face as he feigned injury for Vitesse. That's not the right way to impress Mourinho. 

41mins: Cech saves again. This time from a Vejinovic free-kick. The Blues stopper doesn't seem in the mood to let any goals in this evening. Particularly with Courtois waiting in the wings... 

37mins: Cech is forced into another save with as Leerdam goes through on goal. The Blues skipper sticks out a left leg to keep the score at 2-0.  

Mike Dickson: If I was Jose Mourinho looking at my two loanees to Vitesse I would be much more impressed so far with Bertrand Traore, who has looked pretty lively, than with Wallace. The Brazilian, playing wing back, has been caught out of positioin a couple of times and has not made much happen down the right. But it can’t be an easy game for either.

33mins: That second Chelsea came after some brilliant work by Costa as he ran through the Vitesse defence before being fouled.

The Brazil-born striker showed another glimpse of what he's all about. Pace, power and aggression. Three things that Chelsea fans have been missing since the departure of a certain Didier Drogba. 

Mike Dickson: That was nearly a severe embarrassment for Petr Cech, who had looked rock solid up until that botched clearance. The crowd, which is [probably more like 20,000 after a late influx, have got defalted after Vitesse looked far more composed following the shaky start. Friendly or not, one thing pretty evident already is that Diego Costa is not someone to be messed with.

And Fabregas curls the resulting free-kick home from 25-yards. He has his first goal in a Chelsea shirt and what a way to start! 

20mins: The game has settled down now as Vitesse go on the attack with Vako, but Cahill is there to clear the danger.

At the other end, Diego Costa has got into a bit of a scrap after being fouled just outside the Vitesse box.

It may be a pre-season friendly, but you wouldn't want to argue with the Chelsea striker...

15mins: Vitesse seemed to be causing their own problems here as they insist on playing the ball around the back and forcing the passes back to their goalkeeper Room. 

Matic has started brilliantly, breaking up play and laying on the ball for Costa for the first goal.

11mins: It's been a brilliant start from Chelsea as they continue to press Vitesse after scoring the early goal. 

As I write though, Vako has just forced Blues keeper Petr Cech into a brilliant save. The Georgian found space and struck a powerful effort with his right foot which Cech was equal to.

Thibaut Courtois, who is in the Chelsea dugout, will have enjoyed that one. 

Mike Dickson: The smoke from the flares at the start barely had time to clear before that notably unselfish bit of play from Diego Costa to put Salah in and the Egyptian nearly added to it a minute later. Not much sign of Vitesse from the home defenders so far.

Chelsea are in the lead after just four minutes as Diego Costa runs through on goal before sliding the ball to the onrushing Salah who taps into an empty net. 

We're underway at the GelreDome as Chelsea start with the ball. 

Mike Dickson: Slightly surreal start to the evening as the stewardess in the press area asks me if I am the bloke who presents Match of the Day back in England (I am not).

A pleasant evening in the East of Holland with a cluster of about 250 Chelsea fans in their own corner.

Quite a smattering of Chelsea fans all over the ground, reinforcing the close relationship between these two clubs.

The Gelredome is a nicely appointed stadium seating 26,000 but looks like it will be about 10,000 short of capacity tonight.

Chelsea look set to offload Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku for a fee of £25million. 

The striker had been expected to join up with Jose Mourinho's side on Wednesday afternoon but he is now flying to England from Belgium to seal a five-year, £75,000-a-week deal with the Toffees.

So, Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has opted to start with both Fernando Torres and Diego Costa in the Blues line-up.

Chelsea's £32m signing Costa will be hoping to add to his impressive start in a blue shirt which saw him bag a goal on his non-competitive debut. 

Tonight's clash comes too soon for Didier Drogba to make his second Chelsea debut as the Ivorian has just two days of training under his belt but Blues fans will be able to catch another glimpse of new signings Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis.
