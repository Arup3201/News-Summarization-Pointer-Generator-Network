A woman who claimed a mystery man crept into her house and took a photo of himself on her phone has remembered that she actually knows him.

The woman, named only as Susan, said she found a selfie of a 'stranger' sitting in her home in Plymouth, Devon, on her phone.

However, she phoned police this morning and said she does know the man - and had even invited him in for coffee.

Strange: A woman, only known as 'Susan', found this image on her phone and did not recognise the man

A Devon and Cornwall police spokesman said: 'We've had contact from the woman this morning whose phone the image was on, to say she now knows who the man in the picture is and that he was in her house legitimately.

'We are therefore assured this has been a mistake, the man in the photo is not a suspect of any crime and we will be making further contact with this person shortly to learn more.'

The woman is not expected to be questioned in connection with any crime, such a wasting police time.

However, the force has issued an apology to the public.

The spokesman said: 'We assume this was a genuine lapse of memory by this woman and we want to apologise to anyone who has been distressed by initially reading this story.'

The image shows the woman's lounge from the dining table with a photo of a man reflected in the mirror.

Speaking yesterday the woman, who is in her 30s and lives in the Barbican area of Plymouth, said: 'In the picture he looks comfortable in my home. I showed the picture to friends and family and they are absolutely horrified.

Mistake: The woman told police today she did know the mystery man - and had even invited him in for coffee

'I think when the photo was taken I had been in the shower.

'It took me a week before I could stay in the house again. I'm absolutely terrified.

'Now, every time I hear a noise I flinch. It's the fact that he sat at my dining table, while I was in the house and if it wasn't for him taking that picture I wouldn't have ever known.

'That's what frightened me the most.

'The creepiest thing was him not taking anything of worth, it's unnerving. I want to know who he is and why he came into my home. I won't feel safe until I know who he is.'
