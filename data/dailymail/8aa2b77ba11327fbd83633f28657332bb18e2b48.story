The new owners of the South Beach mansion where Gianni Versace lived and died said Tuesday that they hope to use the Italian fashion designer's name and legacy in rebranding the property as a hotel.

VM South Beach LLC bid $41.5 million for the oceanfront property on Miami Beach's touristy Ocean Drive.

The company's principals include the Nakash family of New York, which controls Jordache Enterprises.

Sold! Gianni Versace's former home in South Beach, known by most as Casa Casuarina, was sold at auction today to the firm behind fashion label Jordache for $41.5million

Design marvel: Though the property was refurbished when it became Villa by Barton G, the style is very much in keeping with the lavish tastes of its former owner

Joe Nakash, chairman of Jordache 
Enterprises, said he expects to retain all the vestiges of Versace's 
time in South Beach in the 1990s - the snake-haired Medusa heads, a 
swimming pool inlaid with 24-karat gold tiles, gold-plated bathroom 
fixtures, custom-made mosaic floorings and frescos and the throngs of 
tourists who still routinely stop to have their picture taken on the 
front steps where the designer was slain.

'We're going to keep it the way it is,' Nakash said.

Jordache Enterprises owns five hotels in Miami Beach, including the Hotel Victor next door to the mansion.

Success! Joe Nakash is the new owner of the Versace mansion in Miami Beach, Florida. His winning bid beat that of Eric Trump who was bidding on behalf of his father

Unlucky: Eric Trump failed to make the winning bid for the Versace mansion today

Will it be Hotel Versace? The new owners hope to use the Italian fashion designer's name and legacy in rebranding the property as a hotel

Palatial: Peter Loftin, a telecom entrepreneur, bought the mansion in 2000 and resided there before its conversion into a boutique hotel in 2009

Expansion: The home was totally remodelled by Versace himself after he fell in love with the property

History: Though the Versace family hasn't owned the oceanfront mansion since 2000, auctioneers hoped the designer's legacy would attract potential buyers

'We'd
like the public to use it, so we're going to create a hotel that will 
be consolidated with the Victor,' Nakash said. 'We're going to use the 
name Versace after we receive OK from the family.'

Efforts to reach representatives for the Versace family were unsuccessful Tuesday.

Though
the Versace family hasn't owned the oceanfront mansion since 2000, 
auctioneers hoped the designer's legacy would attract potential buyers.

Celebrities and investors worldwide expressed interest, but in the end, 
only three bidders emerged, said Lamar Fisher, president and CEO of 
Fisher Auction Company, which was appointed by a bankruptcy court.

Bidding
started at $25.5 million and rose in $500,000 increments under a tent 
next to the mansion's 54-foot-long swimming pool, Fisher said.

Bargain! The mansion had previously been listed for $125million, before the price was slashed in November to $100million, and again in May to $75million. Its last asking price before auction was $50million

Unique: There are not many homes as utterly lavish as the house where Versace lived until his death

Spectacular view: Only an extravagant multi-millionaire could afford to buy the Miami Beach mansion

Grandeur: The couturier added a 6,100-square-foot south wing to the property and covered the courtyard in thousands upon thousands of individual mosaic tiles

Competition: VM South Beach outbid Donald Trump, whose other South Florida real estate holdings include the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and Trump National Doral

VM
South Beach outbid Donald Trump, whose other South Florida real estate 
holdings include the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach and Trump National 
Doral. It also outbid Wellington developer Glenn Straub, who owns the 
Palm Beach Polo and Country Club.

Trump's son Eric left the 
mansion without speaking to reporters. Fisher said Trump's highest bid 
was $41 million, and he could get the property if the deal with VM South
Beach falls through.

'It's a cash transaction. There are no 
contingencies on the property,' Fisher said. A bankruptcy judge is 
expected to approve the deal Wednesday.

Boutique: The Versace motif remains on the floor of one of the hotel suites, a tribute to the designer who spent $33million renovating and expanding the property after he bought it in 1992

Prints and patterns: The villa was originally built in the 1930s by architect Alden Freeman as an homage to the oldest existing house in the western hemisphere in Santo Domingo

Lavish: The hotel still features the murals and frescoes painted on the walls and ceilings by Mr Versace, a detail that contributes to the hefty price tag

The mansion has been 
officially named Casa Casuarina for more than a decade, operating first 
as a private club and then as a boutique hotel until earlier this year. 
But locals still refer to it as 'the Versace mansion.'

It was initially 
listed for sale at $125 million last year. The asking price dropped to $75 million by June, and Nakash said he had been prepared to offer that much for the property.

'Have you ever been inside? You will understand how beautiful it is. The art, the pool, everything,' Nakash said.

Illuminating: A skylight brightens up the original interior designed by Gianni Versace in the famously ornate home that he bought in 1992 after falling in love with the property

Even
if the Versace family declines to license their name, Nakash said he 
planned to honor the designer with a plaque marking where he died.

Dan
Golinsky, who works in real estate in Miami, still has his Casa 
Casuarina membership card in his wallet. Standing outside the mansion, 
he said the bidders knew the property came with a cache they could 
extend to their wealthy clientele.

'The whole thing has its own 
persona that obviously still speaks well for what Versace did in 
renovating it and bringing that prominence to Miami Beach,' Gorlinksy 
said.

Residential palace: The one-acre property features ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, seven fireplaces, a garage for 12 cars and a guesthouse

Versace and an entourage of celebrity friends that included
Madonna, Cher and Elton John helped change South Beach from a 
retirement community known as 'God's waiting room' to the party-centric,
international tourist destination it is today.

The designer 
bought a neglected three-story, Mediterranean-style home, originally 
built in 1930 by Standard Oil heir Alden Freeman, and a dilapidated 
hotel next door in 1992 and spent $33 million on renovations. The 
23,000-square-foot mansion has 10 bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and an open-air
courtyard.

Versace was fatally shot in 1997 by serial killer Andrew Cunanan, who later shot himself as a police search closed in on him.
