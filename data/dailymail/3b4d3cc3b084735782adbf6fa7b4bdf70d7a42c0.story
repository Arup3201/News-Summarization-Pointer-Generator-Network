A police sergeant has resigned after an investigation found nude photos of her on her work computer and sex websites she had allegedly visited during work.

Daytona Beach Police Department sergeant Penny Dane stored images of herself pulling pornographic poses in her uniform on her work computer and sent explicit images of herself on sex websites while on duty, the investigation found.

The mother-of-two, who served the force for 17 years, quit after the discovery, it was reported.

The internal investigation which was triggered when Dane filed a complaint against another officer and had her computer investigated as part of the inquiry.

Caught: Daytona Beach Sergeant Penny Dane resigned earlier this month after an investigation found scores of naked pictures of her on her work computers - images she had shared while on duty

According to the internal report, Dane used both department-issued computers to share more than 270 explicit images while she was meant to be on duty and supervising other officers, WFTV reported.

Officials claimed that Dane would use an online game, where visitors can have virtual sex online, during her work time.

Officials discovered 177 images on Dane's office computer and 97 images on the laptop inside her marked patrol car, ClickOrlando reported.

At least 23 of the pictures were of the sergeant herself, it was alleged.

Family: Dane, a mother of two daughters, quit the forces after 17 years of service

Secret life: She had been sharing the images on an online game where users can have virtual sex

Daytona Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood claimed that Dane deactivated her patrol car's tracking device while she went online and accessed the graphic photos.

But the sergeant allegedly defended her actions, saying that she had never missed a call because she could juggle her extra-curricular activities and her law-enforcing responsibilities.

Sgt. Dane allegedly told investigators she was able to multi-task while on duty, and had never missed a call while accessing the photos, Click Orlando reported.

Shock: The chief of Daytona Beach Police Department, pictured, said he had never experienced anything like this in all of his years of service. He called the images extremely graphic

Chief Mike Chitwood says the officer was not fired but the case has been turned over to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, News 13 reported.

'She's lost her, forfeited her right to be a police officer,' Chitwood said.

'We'll be going after her license so that she can never become a cop again.  Never be a cop anywhere in the state of Florida.'

Chief Chitwood was unavailable to comment when the Mail Online attempted to contact him.
