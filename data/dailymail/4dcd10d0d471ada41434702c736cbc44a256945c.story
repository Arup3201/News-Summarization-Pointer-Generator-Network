There's always got to be that guy who steps it up at a wedding.

Thankfully for this reception, six-year-old Harlan was there to warm up the dance floor.

Literally. 

Dancing with himself: Harlan, six, literally warmed up the dance floor at his aunt and uncle's wedding 

His Uncle Logan and Aunt Kelly, who had just tied the knot, were swaying lovingly to Crazy Little Thing Called Love.

About five other couples were also gently rocking along to the live brass band music, arm-in-arm.

But Harlan had other ideas.

Taking advantage of the largely abandoned floor across the hall, the little boy grabbed his head with both hands, lay on his side, and let loose. 

Taking it slow: The rest of the guests, plus the bride and groom, were gently swaying to the live brass band

According to the cameraman Ronnie Blackburn, the party-starter was trying to impress a few of the young girls in attendance.

No doubt they came flocking shortly after.

Blackburn commented on his video: 'For those who have expressed concern, I assure you that Harlan is neither epileptic nor autistic; he is just a fun-loving, energetic kid with a cute dance. 

'I think he may have been trying to impress some girls at the wedding, although I'm not sure if he picked the best dance for the job!'
