Not so long ago, if a race got physical, Laura Muir admits she would be left wondering what had hit her.

Now, with yet another huge stride having just been taken on her impressively rapid and upward career trajectory, the 21-year-old insists she is more than capable of giving as good as she gets.

The unwelcome blip of failing to make the 800 metres final at the World Indoor Championships in March seemed to have been well and truly forgotten earlier this week as Muir surveyed Hampden and the multi-coloured arena which will provide the stage for two landmark athletics meetings that could potentially send this modest shooting star into a different stratosphere.

Ready to rumble: Laura Muir has toughened up for the Commonwealth Games

One, of course, is the Commonwealth Games, where she plans to contest both the 800m and 1500m. The other, which comes first, is the Diamond League meeting which will pitch up at the home of Scottish football on July 11 and 12.

Muir – who clearly can’t wait to try out the revolutionary track - will run the 800m on that occasion and, in what will be a fascinating sub plot, so too will her compatriot Lynsey Sharp.

The fact that both are finding form at just the right time means a Scottish head-to-head for honours is considerably more than just a remote a possibility.

On Sunday, In the Dutch city of Hengelo, Muir took part in her first race of the outdoor season and promptly ran a 1500m personal best time of 4:02.91.

At the same meeting Sharp, who has not had her injury troubles to seek, was also breaking new ground for herself – a time of 2:00:09 providing an 800m personal best and putting the European champion second in the Commonwealth rankings.

Moving up a rung on the athletic ladder has to be hard-earned though and, even if it might not necessarily be part of her nature away from competition, Muir insists she is more than happy to fight her corner now when it comes to the dark arts of racing.

‘I remember during what was my first race of quite a high standard, at the BMC in Manchester, and I got spiked and pushed – I just came off the track thinking: “What have I been doing for the past seven years? This not what I’ve been doing!”,’ said the 21-year-old.

Bouncing back: Muir has recovered from her disappointment at the World Indoor Championships

‘I’ve learned a lot. It’s been a very steep learning curve over the past couple of years but it’s been really good, I enjoy it, and now I know to just shrug it off, get my elbows out and I’ll be fine.’

Those elbows had to be sharpened and put to good use in Hengelo, a race which provided just the sort of preparation and confidence boost to fuel Muir’s missions this summer.

‘It was just really good to be back racing,’ she said of her second-place finish. ‘I really enjoyed it. I was nice and relaxed and calm going into it.

'I stuck at the front and then just went with a couple of hundred to go. I felt really strong – there was a bit of elbowing and pushing on the home straight – but I managed to get past it and felt really good.

‘It’s strange because I am quite quiet but I think that certainly when I go out on the track it’s a flip of a switch.

Friendly rivalry: Lynsey Sharp is also competing in the 800m

‘But you’ve got to be (aggressive). I think if I wasn’t then I wouldn’t be where I am today. I think it does take a strong character to race and race well tactically. If you let other people intimidate you then that’s just not how to race really.

'You’ve just got to be really confident in yourself and that’s what I try to do. I just have to hold my position, which can be a bit hard when I’m a bit smaller than quite a lot of them, but I just know that I’ve got the ability so I know I have to be in the right place at the right time and I’ll be stronger than them in the finish.’

The good news is that Muir thinks there is plenty still to come from her. There is a calm certainty in her voice when she insists that her 1500m time will translate into her breaking the two-minute barrier for 800m.

‘I feel like I could have run faster (in Hengelo),’ she added. ‘The way my training is going, it (running under two minutes) should be on the cards.

'It’s quite a landmark for a distance runner to break that mark, even for guys. I’m not going to push for it though. Times come when they come. It depends on the race. Even though the 800m is not as variable, you might get a slower race. I never chase times but the time will come.’

Having such fierce competition from close to home in the form of Sharp will help keep motivation levels high, of course. So did Muir have sympathy for the 23-year-old at the weekend when she missed out so narrowly on ducking under 120 seconds?

‘I was delighted to see her back,’ said Muir. ‘And she took a half-second off her personal best. You can’t put any downers on that. You’re so close but, at the same time, you ran a PB. It’s great to see she’s back. She raced really well and I’m sure it will come.

‘Middle-distance running in Scotland is so good just now. It’s probably partly due to the competition.  It’s driving people to train even harder but it’s great to see so many athletes in the distance events. You’re not even guaranteed a spot on the Scotland team, never mind the GB team, which is really good.’

Dress rehearsal: Muir will appear in the Glasgow Grand Prix next month

Before national service, however, comes the Diamond League and another chance to sparkle in Glasgow.

‘It will really help because you get a sense of the atmosphere and what it’s going to be like,’ said Muir of the opportunity to sample competing in the famous venue.

‘Where the warm-up is and the call room and the layout and the surroundings. And the feel of the track as well. It’s hard for people to understand but some are faster than others.

'You can tell with some having longer straights and tighter bends. It will be nice to get out there and see what it’s like.’

Watch the world’s best athletes including Yohan Blake, MoFarah, Christine Ohuruogu, David Weir at the Sainsbury’s Glasgow Grand Prix on July 11-12. Tickets via britishathletics.org.uk
