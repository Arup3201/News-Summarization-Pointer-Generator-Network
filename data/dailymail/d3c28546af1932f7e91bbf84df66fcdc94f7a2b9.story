Leslie Cropper, 37, fled after crashing his car and was discovered by police hiding in the loft where he kept his £120,000 stash of heroin and crack

A drunk drug dealer who fled after crashing his car was discovered by police hiding in the loft where he kept his £120,000 stash of heroin and crack.

Leslie Cropper, 37, has been jailed for five years and four months after admitting possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply and driving over the limit.

He smashed his car down an embankment in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, after a drunken argument with his partner, Leeds Crown Court heard.

Cropper swiftly returned to his nearby home where he was found among £6,000 worth of crack cocaine and heroin weighing 2.389kgs with a potential street value of £112,000.

A breathalyser test revealed he had 53 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath, over the  limit of 35.

He told police: 'I just had a barney with my missus and drove straight off there.' 

Neighbours had heard screaming and shouting and then saw him walk away before returning at speed in a Ford Focus from his nearby home in November this year .

Prosecutor Dave Mackay said Cropper continued the row through the window of the car before he drove off - only to return once more at speed.

But the drink-driver failed to negotiate a junction and crashed down an embankment. He got out of the car and went home where he was found hiding in the loft by police. 

Mr Mackay said officers found heroin and crack cocaine with him in the loft and more heroin in a bag in the bedroom. 

Around £600 in cannabis was also found which Cropper said was for his own use.

He was discovered in the attic of his home in Walker Street, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, by police along with £6,000 worth of crack cocaine and heroin weighing 2.389kgs with a potential street value of £112,000

Initially Cropper claimed to have found the drugs but he later admitted he had been approached a few months earlier by a taxi driver who offered him some work.

He was paid £1,200 each time for bagging up the Class A drugs and said he did it because it was 'easy money.'

Kathryn Stuckey representing Cropper said he worked as a window cleaner but was only earning around £150 a week and found it difficult to make ends meet.  

Judge Sally Cahill QC told him: 'It seems to me to have this amount of heroin in your possession it must have been completely clear to you the scale of the operation you had become involved in.

'This was a very large amount indeed.

'You had it to cut up and deliver it back to those who gave it to you and you were paid £1200 each time so you did it for financial gain.'

He was also banned from driving for 12 months after pleading guilty to driving over the prescribed limit.
