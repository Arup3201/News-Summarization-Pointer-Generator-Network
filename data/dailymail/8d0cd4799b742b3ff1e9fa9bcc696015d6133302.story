David Gikawa, 39, has been found guilty of murdering Linah Keza, 29, in a brutal stabbing at her east London home

A jealous security guard who stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death after she repeatedly told police she feared he would kill her is facing life behind bars.

Linah Keza, 29, of Leyton, east London, had begged for a ‘normal and safe life’ with her young daughter just two days before she was knifed to death by 39-year-old David Gikawa.

The talented dancer and model filled out a risk assessment form telling how Gikawa was armed with a sharpened kitchen blade and had boasted about killing any man she went out with.

Ms Keza had also drafted an affidavit applying for a restraining order and tried to change her locks.

But in the early hours of 31 July last year Gikawa sneaked into her home and knifed her repeatedly in the chest.

He was convicted of murder after a two-week trial at the Old Bailey.

Officers were called to a number of domestic abuse incidents in the two years before Ms Keza was stabbed.

Gikawa threatened to kill the mother of his child a year after they had broken up to stop her being with anyone else.

She told how she was a ‘prisoner in my own house’ and believed he was stalking her.

During one attack Gikawa dragged his former lover through her flat and threw her to the ground.

She told police that he tried to push her head against a scalding radiator before going to the kitchen to get a knife.

The court heard David Gikawa had attacked the model and dancer on a number of occasions before he killed her

Gikawa pinned Ms Keza to the floor and forced the blade into her mouth, she reported to police.

‘Tell me you love me or I’ll kill you,’ he shouted at her.

‘I love you, I love you’, the terrified woman screamed as she begged him to let her go.

One of Ms Keza’s friends dialled 999 after he abducted her from a club in Manor Park in April 2012.

When officers arrived at her home they arrested Gikawa but he was later released without charge.

She gave numerous witness statements about the attacks and said she was ‘petrified’ her ex-partner was going to carry out his threats to murder her.

Ms Keza came to the UK from Rwanda and met Gikawa in 2009 while living in Wolverhampton

Ms Keza told officers that the abuse was getting worse and that she had nowhere to go because her parents were in Rwanda.

She had also drafted an affidavit applying for a restraining order, stating: ‘I am making this application because I believe that I will be at risk of significant harm if the respondent is not ordered to stop immediately.

‘I am petrified of him and I don’t want a life of violence any more.

‘I just want to be able to live a normal and safe life with my daughter.’

Ms Keza came to the UK from Rwanda and met Gikawa in 2009 while living in Wolverhampton.

She described the relationship as ‘on and off’ and said it began to go downhill after the birth of their daughter in 2011.

Ms Keza wrote in the statement that Gikawa was controlling, possessive and used to drink heavily.

‘The respondent controlled me financially as he had an income and I wasn’t working,’ she said.

‘I had to do everything he said for money and for food.

‘He controlled how I dressed and wouldn’t allow me to wear shorts.’

She continued: ‘He would call me nasty names such as prostitute and said that I couldn’t do anything without him.‘When we would argue he would come very close to my face and shout at me, I became frightened.’

The first outbreak of violence took place on 3 March 2011.

Gikawa smothered Ms Keza with a pillow and punched her.

‘He pushed me onto the bed and put a pillow over my head,’ she said. ‘I couldn’t breathe. He began punching the pillow, I thought I was going to die and was petrified.’

Ms Keza managed to call the police and gave an account of what had happened.

She told officers that she felt isolated and that her partner was controlling and manipulative.Gikawa was arrested but released the following day.

The abuse escalated with the worst incident of violence on 9 April 2012 when he attacked her with a knife.

A few days before she was killed Ms Keza changed the lock on her flat. Her brother Ivan Kigenza spoke to her for the last time at 10pm on 30 July last year but she did not mention Gikawa at all.

The next morning he got no answer on her phone and went round to her flat to find the police at the scene.

‘I was told she was dead,’ he said.

She had made a witness statement to police about Gikawa two days before her death.

At around 4.30am on July 31, 2013 he went to the flat and stabbed Ms Keza to death.

The killer said that his three sisters and two of his brothers were murdered in front of him in Rwanda during the genocide in the 1990s

Gikawa denied the abuse had taken place and said he ‘never did anything’ to her.

He claimed Ms Keza was depressed and had threatened to stab herself.

The killer said that his three sisters and two of his brothers were murdered in front of him in Rwanda during the genocide in the 1990s.

Judge Michael Topolski told Gikawa: ‘You have been convicted on the clearest evidence of the brutal murder of a wholly innocent woman.

‘There is only but one sentence that I must pass upon you and that is life imprisonment.

‘I also have to determine how many years you must serve before you can even be considered safe to be released into the community.

‘You may take it that that period of time will be very substantial indeed.

‘You will be here at 2pm on Friday to hear the sentence of this court.’

Ms Keza’s family sat quietly as the verdict was announced but broke down in tears outside the court.

Judge Topolski also commended the brave actions of Ms Keza’s neighbour Gideon Bello who went to investigate after he heard her screams.

‘I wish to give a public commendation to Gideon Bello for his extraordinary bravery in the circumstances,’ he said.

‘He couldn’t possibly have known what was on the other side of that door.’

Judge Topolski invited Mr Bello to the sentencing and said he will receive a financial reward.

Following the killing the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) had launched an investigation into the contact between Miss Keza and police officers.

Gikawa, of Leyton, denied but was convicted of murder.

He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced on May 23 at 2pm.
