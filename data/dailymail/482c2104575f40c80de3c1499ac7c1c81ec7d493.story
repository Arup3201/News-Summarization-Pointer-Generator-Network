A 4-year-old boy was killed and his pregnant mother injured by three pit bulls in Delaware, on Wednesday.

Kasii Haith and his mom, Kiesha (Kyeisha) Haith, 24, of Camden were visiting a friend in Kent County when the boy, who had been playing with the dogs, was attacked about 4 p.m.

Investigators said Kiesha Haith - who is several months pregnant - looked out the window to check on her son who was alone with the dogs in the unfenced yard.

Kasii Haith and his mom, Kiesha Haith, 24, of Camden, Delaware, were visiting a friend when the boy, who had been playing with the dogs, was viciously attacked on Wednesday

When she saw her son being attacked she immediately ran out to save him, while her friend called 911. Kiesha Haith was bit numerous times on both arms, according to police.

Two repairmen from Ambient Heating and Cooling working at the house also tried to help her defend her son, reports Delawareonline.

They tried ‘fending off the animals with PVC piping and assisting the mother from the attacking dogs,’ said Master Corporal Gary Fournier of Delaware State Police.

Emergency services also responded to the scene and began first aid on Kasii before he was pronounced dead. 

The dogs will be euthanized and their remains tested for rabies, none of them had been vaccinated, spayed or neutered

The boy's body has been turned over to 
the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to conduct an autopsy to rule 
the exact cause and manner of death.

Kiesha Haith was 
transported to Kent General Hospital where she is being treated 
for her injuries as well as observation due to pregnancy.

The boy had been around the dogs 'numerous times in the past' without incident, said Fournier.

Delaware Animal Care and Control officers haven taken possession of the dogs, which will be euthanized. Their remains will then be tested for rabies.

None of the dogs had been vaccinated, spayed or neutered, said officials.

The attack happened at the Kent County, Delaware, home of a friend of Kiesha Haith who owned the three pitbulls
