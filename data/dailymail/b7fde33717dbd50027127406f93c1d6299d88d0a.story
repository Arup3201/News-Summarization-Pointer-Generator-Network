Lance Armstrong appeared to be putting fitness first on his list of New Year's resolutions after he was spotted paddle-boarding with his bikini-clad girlfriend in Hawaii this week.

It seemed like strenuous workouts were in need for the disgraced cyclist, 42, who showed off a bit of a paunch as he paddled shirtless in the tropical waters. Armstrong was joined by his 32-year-old girlfriend Anna Hansen who looked incredible in a tiny, black two piece.

The couple were enjoying a beach day on Monday with their two children and Armstrong's three children from his previous marriage.

The blended family enjoyed water sports and a spot of sunbathing, with one of Armstrong's older daughters helping his youngest son build sandcastles.

Armstrong began dating Anna Hansen in July 2008 after they met through his charity work. Five months later, he announced that Miss Hansen was pregnant, having conceived naturally.

At the time, it was believed that Armstrong could no longer father children after having battled testicular cancer in 1996 and undergone chemotherapy.

Their son Maxwell Edward Armstrong was born in 2009. A daughter, Olivia Marie, followed in October 2010.

Armstrong has three children after using IVF with his ex-wife Kristin Richard. The couple married in 1998 and have three children Luke David, 14, and 12-year-old twins Isabelle Rose and Grace Elisabeth.

The pregnancies were possible following the sperm Armstrong banked prior to his cancer treatment The couple divorced in 2003.

The shamed cyclist also dated singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow from 2003 until 2006. He dated designer Tory Burch from March to October 2007.

In 2012, Armstrong was banned from competitive cycling and he was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles over his admitted use of performance-enhancing drugs.

After years of denials, Armstrong admitted last January that he had in fact used performance enhancing drugs during a much-hyped interview with Oprah Winfrey.

The confession came after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report detailed widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by Armstrong and his USPS team.

Armstrong appeared relaxed during his beach vacation despite the fact that this week cycling's governing body appointed a three-man independent panel to investigate the sport's doping past, including allegations the UCI colluded with the athlete.

Armstrong tweeted on Tuesday that he planned to cooperate with the UCI commission but that he had yet to be contacted by the organization.
