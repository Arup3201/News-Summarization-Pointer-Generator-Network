Rapper Aggro Santos denies raping two females after he performed at gigs

Former I'm A Celebrity contestant Aggro Santos raped two girls, one aged just 16, when he took them back to his hotel room after performing at gigs, a court has heard.

The 24-year-old Brazilian-born rapper is alleged to have forced one of the victims to have sex with him after he performed at the opening of Club Soho in Yeovil, Somerset, on September 25, 2010.

He is then accused of raping a then 16-year-old girl in 2011 after the University of Chichester summer ball while friend and co-defendant Tyrelle Ritchie, 22, forced her to perform oral sex on him.

Chichester Crown Court was told that in the Yeovil incident the victim and a friend had gone to the club opening to see Santos perform because they were fans.

Afterwards, as they waited in the car park, they spoke to Santos and she went back to the hotel where she had consensual sex with Santos's manager while her friend went to another room with the rapper.

The alleged victim, who is in her 20s, said that a few minutes later the pair returned to the room and Santos then tried to initiate sex with her which she resisted and then he raped her.

In the second incident in Chichester, West Sussex, on May 7, Santos had performed at the university's summer ball when his crew invited the victim and her relative, who was a student at the university, and two friends to a backstage room for drinks.

Isobel Ascherson, prosecuting, said the group were then invited to an after-show party at the nearby Ship Hotel and they agreed to go.

The rapper denied the accusations at Chichester Crown Court, which heard that he is alleged to have raped two women

Miss Ascherson said the 16-year-old then had consensual sex with Santos in his hotel bathroom while her relative had consensual sex with 21-year-old Ritchie in another room.

She explained the victim then accused Santos of forcing her to have sex for a second time at the same time as Ritchie forced her to perform oral sex on him in the hotel room when they were alone.

The police were then called when the relative found out what had happened and confronted the men, the jury heard.

Miss Ascherson said the victim of the 
Yeovil incident only reported the allegation there after she read 
reports that Santos had been arrested for rape following the Chichester 
incident.

Miss Ascherson said all of the girls involved in the two incidents had consumed 'considerable' amounts of alcohol on the nights concerned and what happened was 'confused'.

She said Santos denied there was any sexual contact with the victim in Yeovil when interviewed by police and said the girl in the Chichester incident initiated the sexual activity with him and Ritchie.

She added that Ritchie told police that the 16-year-old had consensually performed oral sex on him.

Santos, who is charged under his real name Yuri Santos, of Tooting, south west London, denies two counts of rape.

Ritchie, of Lambeth, south east London, denies one count of oral rape.

Santos's debut single, Candy, featuring former Pussycat Dolls singer Kimberly Wyatt, shot to number five in the UK charts in 2010.

But he became more popularly known by his appearance in the 2010 series of ITV's reality game show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, in which he reached the final six.
