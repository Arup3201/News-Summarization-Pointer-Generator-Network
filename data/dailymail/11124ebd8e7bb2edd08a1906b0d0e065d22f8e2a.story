Thomas Eric Duncan was one of five people who rode in a cab with an infected woman who later died

The Liberian cab driver who ferried U.S. Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan and a pregnant 19-year-old who he was helping has said that the woman was so sick she could not walk and had blood trickling out of her mouth.

It is believed that Duncan contracted the deadly virus on that the taxi ride in Monrovia, Liberia, with Nathaline Williams. Ebola spreads by contact with an infected person's blood, sweat, saliva or other bodily fluids.

Five people rode in Jiminez Grugbaye's cab as they searched for a hospital for Williams on September 15. 

Williams later died of Ebola. Her brother, who was with her in the car, died days later. Her parents, who were also in the cab, are currently hospitalized with the disease.

Still, when Duncan flew out of Monrovia en route to Dallas, Texas, he claimed he had not come in contact with anyone infected with Ebola. 

When he showed up at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas with a fever, headache, abdominal pain and decreased urination on September 25, he again claimed he had never come in contact with anyone afflicted with the virulent virus that has already killed 3,300 in West Africa, the hospital announced on Thursday. 

Mr Grugbaye, the taxi driver, told an NBC News crew in Liberia that he had picked up Miss Williams  and ferried her to three hospitals and a clinic while she convulsed and moaned in the back seat. She was clearly very sick and feeble, he said.

Jiminez Grugbaye says he drove the taxi that ferried Duncan and a sick pregnant woman in search of a hospital. All five people who rode in the cab have either died of Ebola or are infected with it

'She was helpless. She, she was not able to walk by herself,' he told NBC. 

Mr Grubaye said he noticed a stream of blood trickling from Williams' mouth. However, her family told him that she had only bit her tongue and that she was suffering a miscarriage - not sick with Ebola. 

Despite Williams' dire condition, she was turned away at three hospitals and a neighborhood clinic. 

Ebola is ripping through the 72nd SKD Boulevard neighborhood where Duncan lived in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, spreading faster than health officials in the impoverished nation can stop its spread.  

Four days after Duncan's counter with Ebola-stricken Williams, he boarded a plane for Brussels, Belgium. From there, he flew on a United Airlines flight to Washington Dulles International Airport, where he was allowed into the country.

Duncan then flew to Dallas, where he stayed with his girlfriend for five days while Ebola began to run its course.
