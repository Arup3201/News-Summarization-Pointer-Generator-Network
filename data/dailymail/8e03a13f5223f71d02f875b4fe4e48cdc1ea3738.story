TV weatherman Al Roker apologized to New York City Mayor Bill de 
Blasio for comments he made on Twitter Thursday about de Blasio being a 
'one term' mayor after he opted to not close schools in the midst of a 
brutal winter storm.

However, Roker is standing by other comments he made about the mayor's decision to not close schools.

In contrast, de Blasio canceled a scheduled press conference Friday morning, at which he likely would have had to face reporters and discuss bungling the second snow storm of his young administration, as well as questions about his intervening in the arrest of a campaign donor who was arrested earlier in the week after it was discovered he had outstanding warrants - de Blasio reportedly called an NYPD official following the arrest of Bishop Orlando Findlayter, sparing the Democratic campaign contributor a night in jail.

Sorry: Al Roker said his comments that Bill de Blasio will be a one-term mayor were 'below the line'

Mistake: Mayor Bill de Blasio, at a press conference on the winter storm, has been criticized for not closing schools

The
 previously portly weatherman said Friday on NBC's Today show that his 
comment 'Long range DiBlasio forecast: 1 term,' was a 'low blow,' but 
says he still disagrees with de Blasio's decision to keep schools open.

De Blasio has said keeping 
schools open was important for working parents, but when New York City was pummeled with more than a foot of snow, the mayor was accused of 
compromising safety.

Safety fears: Weather anchor Al Roker complained that schools were open

Roker led the angry criticism of de Blasio after he kept city schools open while the rest of the state declared a state of emergency amid heavy snowfall.

In addition to the 'one term' comment, Roker, whose daughter goes to school in the city, fired off a series of angry tweets.

He said: ‘Chancellor says Macy's is open, schools should be open. They're also open on Thanksgiving, nights and Sundays. Are you kidding?’

‘And how about all the parents and caregivers who have to scramble to get their kids home? Is there no one there with any common sense?'

Roker, who has twice been voted best weatherman, added: ‘Why are schools all around NYC 
closed? It's going to take some kid or kids getting hurt before this 
goofball policy gets changed.'

‘@NYCMayorsOffice
 @NYCSchools snow policy is ridiculous. Tell people to stay off the 
roads. Stay home. But send your kids/teachers/staff in?'

The mayor responded to Roker's tweets, saying: 'It’s a different thing to run a city than to give the weather on TV.'

The response prompted Roker to tweet: 'Mr Mayor, I could never run NYC, but I know when it's time to keep kids home from school.'

Parents of city school children 
joined in on the criticism of de Blasio, noting that this is the second 
time in as many winter storms that the mayor has failed the city and that his decision to not close schools was 'idiotic.'

'For a man that I voted for,' Manhattan parent Kourosh Mahboubian
 said of De Blasio to the New York Post, 'It’s not the way to get 
re-elected. He doesn’t understand snow. He doesn’t know how to manage 
it.'

Other parents were equally outraged with the mayor.

'Today
 I sent my children to school with absent letters,' Kim D’Angelo, a 
mother of three, and president of School District 26’s President’s 
Council in Queens, told the paper. She said the letter for her 
8-year-old son read in part, 'My son missed school because there was a 
dangerous storm and yet schools were open. I chose the safety of my 
children first.'

Local politicians also joined in the criticism of de Blasio.

'I
 understand the desire to keep schools open,' Michael Mulgrew, the 
president of the city's teachers union, told Politicker.

'The only thing that 
trumps that is safety. Having students, parents and staff traveling in 
these conditions was unwarranted. It was a mistake to open schools 
today,' he added.

A de Blasio spokeswoman declined to 
comment but noted that city schools have only had 11 snow days since 
1978.

Personal: Roker, whose daughter goes to a school in the city, was concerned for children's safety

'The city of New York got it wrong today,' Staten Island assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis said Thursday.

'Keeping schools open and expecting 
children to travel through heavy snow, sleet and ice at the same time 
the city is urging residents to stay off the road is nonsensical.'

Assemblyman Joe Borelli also complained about the decision in a Facebook message to residents in his South Shore area.

Others
 complained that the decision to keep the schools open was made early, 
with parents receiving an email from Chancellor Carmen Fariña at 
10.33pm.

The Department of Education message read: 'Parents, as always, should exercise 
their own judgment with regard to their children. Safety is a top 
priority for the department.'

A spokeswoman for de Blasio declined to comment, but added that city schools have had only 11 snow days since 1978.

At a press conference Thursday morning, de Blasio made no mention of schools as he urged people to stay off the road.
