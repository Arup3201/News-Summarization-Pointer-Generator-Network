The Chinese invented tea and have been producing it for thousands of years.

But a British aristocrat from Cornwall has struck a deal which will see the product shipped from his gardens to be sold in the birthplace of the hot beverage.

The Chinese Embassy's trade minister visited the Tregothnan plantation in Cornwall to view the business opportunities on offer.

Zhou Xiaoming, Chinese Economic and 
Commercial Minister and Councillor, led a delegation of five from the 
embassy on a two-day tour.

They visited the UK's only tea plantation, to taste the famous tea with the view of shipping it over to China, the birthplace of the much-loved hot drink.

The Honourable Evelyn Boscawen, whose family has lived on the private estate since 1335, said he welcomed the strengthening of links between Cornwall and China.

He said: 'This reinforces my belief that Tregothnan and Cornwall will be the headquarters of our growing international business.'

The Tregothnan Estate is located beside the village of St Michael Penkivel, three miles south-east of Truro, Cornwall.

It started supplying England's first tea, the Camellia sinensis, in 2005.

The two-day trip was organised in conjunction with the China-Britain Business Council (CBBC), which helps UK companies to grow and develop their business in China.

Tea was first drunk in Britain in the 17th century when King Charles II married the Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza, who brought the habit of tea drinking with her.

The first pieces of evidence from Britain was written in 1660 when Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary: 'I did send for a cup of tee (a China drink) of which I never had drank before.'

The East India Company brought back many products, but tea proved to be one of the most successful. At first it was promoted as a medicinal beverage but by the end of the seventeenth century, it was taken as a drink, albeit mainly by the aristocracy.

In 1690 nobody would have predicted that by 1750 tea would be the national drink, and one that is still consumed by thousands of people in the UK every day.

Tea is said to have originated in Yunnan, China during the Shang Dynasty, which ruled the country from 1500 BC–1046 BC.

Since then, the Chinese have consumed tea for thousands of years. At first it was a medicinal drink used by the Han dynasty, but would become one of the most consumed hot drinks on the planet when it was exported abroad.

The earliest credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua T'o.

Tea production in China was a laborious process, 
conducted in distant and often poorly accessible regions.

For many hundreds of years the commercially used tea tree has been, in shape, more of a bush than a tree.

Tea was first introduced to Portuguese priests and merchants in China during the 16th century before it was introduced to Britain during the 17th century.

As it quickly became the national drink, British businesses used India as a centre for tea production to try and compete with the Chinese monopoly.

Tea remained a very important item in Britain's global trade, contributing in part its global dominance by the end of the eighteenth century.

To this day tea is seen worldwide as a symbol of 'Britishness', even though its routes are heavily ingrained in China.
