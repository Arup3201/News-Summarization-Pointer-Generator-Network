Court case: Darius Ashard, 21, who played Snoozy the dwarf in panto was sentenced to 40 hours unpaid work for aggravated vehicle taking and handling stolen goods

An actor who played Snoozy the dwarf in a pantomime starring Priscilla Presley screamed 'I'm going to die' as he and his friends led police on a terrifying high-speed car chase, a court heard today.

Darius Ashard, who was in a production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs this Christmas, had been a terrified passenger in a Vauxhall Astra taken in a burglary.

The 21-year-old was arrested in August last year after police found him holding a stolen laptop and an iPad taken from a home in Woodford Green, Essex.

But since then he has 'rubbed shoulders' with Ms Presley, 67, who starred as the Wicked Queen at the New Wimbledon Theatre, and was given rave reviews.

Prosecutor Nadeem Holland told Snaresbrook Crown Court the stolen Astra had hit a red light and then took the wrong exit on the busy North Circular road.

The car then sped in 
the direction of oncoming traffic, causing other drivers to swerve out of the 
way, and forcing police to give up the chase in case someone was killed.

But soon after the gang jumped out of the car they were caught with Ashard left holding the stolen goods.

Daniel Jerome, defending Ashard, said: 'He spent two months working 
at the Wimbledon Theatre in the pantomime Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs, with Priscilla Presley as the leading lady.

'He has rubbed shoulders with all sorts of famous names and being 
part of the cast has given him a window into other potential work in 
that field.

'He was asked by his co-defendants if he could look after a bag containing stolen property.

'He realised there was something untoward but out of goodness to his friends, he said yes.

'As soon as the vehicle started being driven in an undesirable fashion, 
he expressed his wish to leave but he didn't have a choice until it came
to a stop.'

Ashard was handed a 12-month community order with 40 hours unpaid work.

The stolen car was first spotted after a raid in St Anthony's Avenue, Woodford Green, Essex and weaved through traffic to avoid the police.

It was driven by James Howsen, 22, who is already serving a 
five-month sentence for attempting to escape the dock at a previous 
hearing last year, when he admitted aggravated vehicle taking and 
driving without insurance.

He was handed a six-month prison sentence and ordered to pay a £200 
fine, as well as being disqualified from driving for a year and given six penalty 
points.

Passing sentence, Judge Joanna Korner QC said: 'The course of driving outlined by the prosecution was dangerous in the extreme.

'You could have caused the death and or serious injury of a number of other people and indeed, you could probably have killed yourselves.

'Both of you knew this car was stolen and you, Ashard, none the less got in the car and added to your offences by taking possession of goods which you admitted you knew perfectly well were stolen.

'In your case, Ashard, you have lost your good name and that may have an impact on your future.

'In your case, Howsen, it seems to be the continuation of conduct that has been going on for some years but I take the view there is some hope for you.

'This is your last chance.' 

Nathan Pearce, 21, who was also a passenger, will be sentenced at a later date for aggravated vehicle taking and two counts of burglary.
