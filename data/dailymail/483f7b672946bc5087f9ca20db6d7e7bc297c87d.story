Executives at A&E, the TV network behind Duck Dynasty, have admitted that they could have done more to dampen the hysteria surrounding Phil Robertson’s anti-gay remarks by immediately taking the hit reality show off the air for two weeks during the holiday break.

The show has been immersed in controversy since homophobic quotes made by Robertson likening homosexuality to bestiality in the January 2014 issue of GQ Magazine became public last Wednesday.

In the immediate aftermath of the controversy the network sought to distance itself from Robertson by suspending him indefinitely, and saying 'his personal views in no way reflect those of A&E'.

The matter then escalated after Republican politicians and figures, such as former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and Texas Senator Ted Cruz, spoke out citing Robertson’s right to free speech.

Supporters of the show also utilized social media to campaign for Robertson to be instated. A source at the network told RadarOnline that the pro-Phil campaign social media campaigns had ‘taken on a life of their own, and it’s an absolute disaster for A&E.’

‘Network bosses now recognize they should have just taken the show off the air for two weeks, since reruns were just airing anyway. The fallout wouldn’t have been strong and everyone could have just moved on.’

The source said the future of the hit show now depend on the two sides reaching a compromise.

‘Now, it’s a stand-off between the family and the network, who is going to blink first? There is no way Phil is going to apologize for his comments because he doesn’t think what he said is hateful or prejudice, it’s his religious beliefs,’ the source said.

‘The network is hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and a solution that is suitable for both parties can be reached. A&E isn’t going to walk away from Duck Dynasty, they can’t afford to do it. It’s just a matter of getting both sides to agree on how to move forward,’ the insider added.

In the meantime, the network appears to have decided to capitalize on wave of publicity surrounding their number one show and on Christmas Day the network will air a super marathon of Duck Dynasty episodes.

From Wednesday afternoon and stretching on for over 11 hours, viewers can watch Phil Robertson and his Louisiana clan stroke their beards, bicker with their wives and of course hunt for ducks.

The decision will come as a slap in the face to those who supported the network's decision to suspend Robertson after anti-gay and racially insensitive remarks he made to GQ magazine - and years before in a 2010 sermon - made national headlines.

Those who support the decision say A&E is just giving fans what they want - more of one of the most popular reality shows ever.

'I think, honestly, it’s A&E trying to play both sides of the coin,' celebrity blogger Cate Meighan told Fox News. 'They’ve come out and not supported Phil’s statements… however they’re also looking at the backlash from the fans, and they have a huge amount of backlash from the fans.'

Robertson, the patriarch of the Louisiana clan on the reality show about hunting, fishing and domestic squabbles, was put on indefinite hiatus by A&E last week for his remarks to GQ magazine characterizing homosexuality as sinful behavior.

The network has previously said it was disappointed after reading Robertson's remarks, which it added were his personal views and did not reflect those of the network.

Civil rights groups GLAAD criticized the comments, but the 67-year-old Robertson also found supporters among Republican politicians and figures such as former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

The IStandWithPhil.com website, run by the organization Faith Driven Consumer, is petitioning A&E to reinstate Robertson and formally apologize to his family and his fans for removing him from future filming.

It has collected more than 202,868 signatures since Friday, storming past its goal of 200,000.

A Facebook page called 'Boycott A&E Until Phil Robertson Is Put Back on Duck Dynasty' has garnered more than 1.7 million likes and another called 'Boycott A&E and Support Phil Robertson' has more than 15,000 likes.

A petition on Change.org titled 'A&E Network: Bring Phil Robertson back!' has more than 116,600 signers.

The future of the popular series, 
which is scheduled to begin its previously taped fifth season on Jan. 
15, is up in the air following Robertson's indefinite suspension and his
 family hinted that they would not participate without him.

‘We
 have had a successful working relationship with A&E but, as a 
family, we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch 
at the helm,' the family said in a statement last Thursday.

The
 standoff between the Robertson family and A&E has put big money in 
the balance as the impasse also threatens a vast array of 'Duck Dynasty'
 licensed merchandise that has brought in some $400 million, according 
to Forbes magazine.

Duck
 Dynasty brand apparel and products, including camouflage bed sheets and
 reclining furniture, are sold at retailers such as Target and Walmart.

And some say it's that lucrative popularity that makes it nearly impossible for A&E to turn its back in the show.

The show's fourth season debuted in August to 11.8 million viewers, a record for a cable nonfiction series, A&E said.

It
 averages about eight million viewers per episode and its Christmas 
special was most-watched non-sports cable program on U.S. television 
last week.

'It is 
really a money thing,' Meighan said. 'Unfortunately people are 
secondary...At the end of every single thing that we see it’s about the 
money and the advertising.'

The fifth season of the show, which includes episodes featuring Robertson, begins airing January 15.
