The scale of boozing in Parliament has been revealed by a bar bill topping £1.4million in just two years.

While the nation is being told to cut down on its drinking, MPs, their staff and visitors to Parliament downed thousands of bottles of wine, beer and spirits in 2012 and 2013.

There are few signs that politicians are getting the message on curbing their alcohol intake: the Commons bars bought in 10,248 bottles of Becks and just 408 bottles of the non-alcoholic version.

Parliament has revealed how much alcohol it bought in 2012 and 2013

Parliament has bought thousands of bottles of alcohol, including House of Commons whisky, Corona lager and Malibu

A Freedom of Information request by The Times revealed that parliamentary authorities bought nearly 50,000 bottles of House of Commons sauvignon, more than 26,000 of house merlot and more than 33,000 pints of guest ale.

More than 8,500 bottles of champagne were purchased alongside over 2,100 bottles of Speaker John Bercow's whisky.

According to the newspaper, spending in Commons bars has gradually increased over the past three years, from just over £222,000 in April 2011 to more than £249,000 in the year to April last year, but this may reflect rising prices.

It includes spending £122,931.04 on beer, £121,032.77 on spirits, £731,635.65 on wine and £458,861.00 on drink sold in the gift shops.

The figures may lead to further 
questions over Parliament's supposed drinking culture, which was laid 
bare in the trial of Tory MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of sex 
offences.

The Commons booze 
culture also hit the headlines when Eric Joyce was forced to resign the 
Labour whip in 2012 after fighting Tory MPs in a Commons bar.

Most of the alcohol will have been drunk by the 650 MPs, 760 peers, and thousands of staff and parliamentary workers in the Palace of Westminster.

The figures include 10,989 pints of Guinness, 5,448 pints of Stella Artois, 12,96 bottles of Corona lager and 10,800 bottles of Peroni Nastro Azzuro.

The bars and restaurants cater for all tastes, getting through 10.5 litres of Bailer's, 463 litres of Gordon's Gin, 13.3 litres of Jack Daniels, 52 litres of Famous Grouse whisky and 4.5 litres Malibu.

A House of Commons Spokesperson, said: 'The House has seen an increased number of commercial banqueting events involving external customers in recent years. 

'The increasing trend is to sell more receptions than dinner events which attract higher numbers of guests and is the reason for increased consumption and sales in alcohol. 

'To accommodate this increase in demand, banqueting has increased its stock for sale at such events. It is not possible to disaggregate sales or consumption by user.

'By allowing commercial events to take place, the House is able to help reduce the running cost of the House to the taxpayer. 

'The cost of providing a catering service for the House of Commons is steadily decreasing. In 2014/15 the net cost of House of Commons Catering Service is budgeted to be £3 million. 

'This compares with 2010/11 at £5.8 million, and £4.7 million in 2012/13. The House of Commons incurs costs for providing a Catering Service, because of the irregular hours and unpredictability of parliamentary business.'
