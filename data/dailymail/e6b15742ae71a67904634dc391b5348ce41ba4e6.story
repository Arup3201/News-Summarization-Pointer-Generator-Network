A rare Rolls-Royce Phantom from 1925 with an elephant rifle and hand-cranked machine gun in tow is up for auction.

The red ‘Tiger Car’ Phantom I, which was commissioned by the maharaja of Kotah, India, will be auctioned today at Barrett-Jackson’s Las Vegas auction.

The annual auction event, now in its sixth year, started on September 26 and finishes today.

The car, which was built for game hunting, such as elephants and tigers, is based on a 1925 Rolls-Royce Torpedo Sports Tourer.

'Tiger Car': The rare Rolls-Royce Phantom is equipped with a machine gun and elephant rifle to hunt game

Auction: The car, which was originally painted grey, is up for auction in Las Vegas today

Opulent: The rare Rolls-Royce was custom-built with plush seats and a sexy interior design for a maharaja in India

Powerful: The Tiger Car is equipped with an 8.0-litre six-cylinder engine

Royal car: The vintage vehicle was commissioned by India's Umed Singh II, who was the maharaja of Kotah, India, from 1889 to 1940

It was not unusual to see maharajas in 19th and early 20th century India spend a lot of money on their customised cars, with plush interiors and flashy colours.

But high-powered weaponry was not typically on the car pimping agenda.

The car’s original owner, Umed Singh II, who was the maharaja of Kotah from 1889 to 1940, was an avid game hunter.

When he ordered the vehicle, we had it made with taller tires, searchlights front and rear, and gun racks.

The car, which was originally painted
 grey, is powered by an 8.0-litre six-cylinder engine and tows a .45 
calibre hand-cranked machine gun.

A double barrel pistol hangs from the side, and there is an elephant gun mounted on the rear bumper.

The colour change could be a reason the maharaja’s ride isn’t expected to fetch more than $1 million, according to Wired.com.

Despite the vintage arsenal, hard-core collectors want their toys all original.
