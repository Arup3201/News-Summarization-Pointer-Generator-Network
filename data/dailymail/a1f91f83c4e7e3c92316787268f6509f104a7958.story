A three-year-old girl abandoned at a Los Angeles shopping center on Saturday looks set to be reunited with her father after he contacted police following media reports about the girl's disappearance. 

The dark-haired girl, called Audrey, was dropped off at the valet parking area of The Grove shopping center at around 6 p.m. on Saturday.

According to the Los Angeles Police Department, parking attendants saw a woman - believed to be a relative - drop the three-year-old off along with a car seat, but no one arrived to pick her up.

Audrey: A three-year-old named Audrey was abandoned Saturday at a Los Angeles shopping center. Her father contacted police on Sunday after the girl's grandfather saw a TV report about the missing girl 

The attendants notified the police who then took Audrey into protective custody. The search to find her family was hampered due to the girl being unable to give her last name or any information about her parents.

When the girl’s father finally contacted police about his daughter on Sunday afternoon he was interviewed by child protective services.

Police are treating the case as a misunderstanding after the father told officers that he didn't initially know his daughter was missing. 

Audrey was happy and talkative, when she was first turned over to the LAPD, according to Lt. Lonnie Tiano, who said she was in 'good shape.'

Children and Family Services are still establishing if the man is Audrey's father and have yet to decide whether to turn her over to him, reports NBC4.

Police say they received calls from a number of people offering gifts or a home to Audrey after her picture was released to the media in a bid to find her family. 

Audrey's father told police he had been looking for his daughter at The Grove until 11 p.m.

He assumed that the person that Audrey was with had taken her home. They had been supposed to meet at The Grove earlier that day.

Audrey's San Diegan grandfather spotted her picture on a news report on Sunday and then informed his son  

Audrey, who has long, dark hair and dark brown eyes, was found wearing purple pants and a pink shirt.
