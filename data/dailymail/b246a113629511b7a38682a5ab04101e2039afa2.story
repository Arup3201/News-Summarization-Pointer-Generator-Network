It was by any standards an unlikely and quite bizarre foray into the turbulent world of Twitter. So what could possibly have prompted Stuart Broad to pass comment on the minimum wage? Who could he be referring to?

Already on this tour we have had the Eoin Morgan blackmail plot and now came another unexpected twist to life with the England cricket team when Broad found himself having to defend comments on the worldwide strength of English pay levels. Yes, really.

There was only one conclusion to be reached here in scorching hot Western Australia and that was that Broad, one of the players attacked by Kevin Pietersen in his controversial autobiography, was having a subtle dig at his bête noire.

It was Pietersen, of course, who caused another rumble here last weekend with his comments about the need for changes to the structure of the domestic game and his belief that only the fittest should survive in county cricket.

‘Muppets that only earn £15 to £18 grand should either get better or get out and do something else,’ Pietersen had said. So was that what caused Broad, who was accused of bullying by Pietersen in his book and of ‘not being the sharpest,’ to have a dabble in the world of financial politics?

No, insisted Broad, who had tweeted ‘I’ve heard if you earn minimum wage in England you’re in the 10 per cent top earners in the world. #Stay #Humble.

‘It was genuinely innocent,’ said Broad at the end of another long and gruelling England training session in temperatures touching 40 degrees. ‘I heard that stat and I was quite surprised and amazed at the size of the world.

‘That was all that was in it. I put two more tweets out to try and clarify and emphasise that I didn’t meant any offence if anyone took it that way.

He even came to Pietersen’s defence over what were, to be fair, constructive comments about the best way forward for Twenty20 cricket in England.

‘To back him up a bit he does use that word (muppet) about himself sometimes,’ said Broad at the WACA. ‘But the development role in the county game is very important. No-one’s going to come in and start on big wages.

‘You have to earn your stripes. I think that figure Kevin used is a bit below the minimum earned anyway so it was a bit off the mark. I don’t think he meant any offence by it. It was just a little bit misguided I think.’

At times like this you do wonder why on earth any public figure would get involved in Twitter. All it seems to bring them is a torrent of abuse when they attempt to say anything even vaguely different. But Broad has not been put off.

‘I don’t look at my mentions on Twitter so I didn’t see the response,’ he said. ‘I only heard second hand. There’s a notification thing where you can only see it when people you follow mention you. The people I follow weren’t that bothered about it to be honest.

‘We’re quite lucky in the abuse we receive compared to footballers. I’ d hate to see Wayne Rooney’s Twitter mentions after he’s lost a game. It’s part and parcel of the world now. You’re more open to everything, aren’t you? It wasn’t a mistake. It was just a genuine comment and I didn’t think about the other side of it. The stay humble hash tag was aimed at myself to remind us how lucky we are. Maybe I misjudged it a bit but hopefully it will die down a bit now.’

Broad was far more comfortable talking about his return to the England side after knee surgery that caused him to miss the one-day tour of Sri Lanka before Christmas. He has appeared to be easing his way back here in the tri-series which precedes the World Cup.

‘Four and a half months is a long lay off and I think when you get back you grow with every game,’ he said. ‘I’ve got a lot of experience but there’s nothing like getting out in the middle. Realistically I can look at my performances and say I’ve bowled one or two too many bad balls and given away cheap fours which you can’t afford to do in one-day cricket now.

‘I also know that I’ve gone through games where I haven’t taken wickets and then picked up a handful so hopefully come semi-final and final time in the World Cup it will be my chance to shine.’

His pace has been down here so now, with Broad bowling at no more than 81 or 82 miles per hour for the most part, and that man Pietersen for one said at the weekend that he was a bit concerned about England’s match-winning bowler.

Broad insists there is no cause for alarm. ‘A bit of extra pace comes with the rhythm and the match feeling I suppose. I feel like I’m running in nicely and I’ve had no problems with the knee whatsoever. And I’ve had quite a decent workload. It’s been good to be involved again.

He is looking forward to tomorrow’s match here against India which will see the winners take on Australia on Sunday in the tri-series final.

‘Perth is where you want to bowl as a tall bowler so hopefully we can do to India what we did to them in Brisbane. I’ve not taken the wickets I want to up to now but I feel I’m delivering what’s in my mind. The way one-day cricket is, wickets will come to you when it’s your time. When it’s your day you have to cash in.’

While Broad and Jimmy Anderson are easing their way back after injury, Chris Woakes and Steven Finn have impressed for England.

‘You only need to look at the amount of wickets Woakes has taken in the last 15 or 20 one-day internationals,’ said Broad. ‘He’s done fantastically well and I think from watching him in the nets he’s developed a bit more of a snap at the crease. That has given him a bit more pace and I hope he can take that form into the World Cup.

‘But the biggest change in confidence is in Finny. Just the way he’ s been around the group. He’s more chirpy. His head is up a lot more. He’s a lot clearer on what he wants to work on in the nets and it was great to see him get that five-for in Brisbane. It was just rewards for how he has been improving.’

It is the lack of variety in England’s attack that worries onlookers.

‘Teams have won World Cups without left-armers before,’ said Broad. ‘You can see from Twenty20 stats that they have good records in white ball cricket and every team would want one in their side. But there is enough variety in our attack with the different heights and each bowler has different slower balls and that sort of thing. We’re just looking to put a complete game together.’

And stay humble in the process.
