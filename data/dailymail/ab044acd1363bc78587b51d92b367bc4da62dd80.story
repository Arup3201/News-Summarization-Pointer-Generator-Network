Paula Deen staged a comeback on Sunday which appeared to involve swigging from a tequila bottle and riding piggy-back style on the back of fellow TV chef Robert Irvine.

The disgraced
Food Network star turned a cooking demo at the South Beach Wine and Food Festival in Miami this weekend into a public apology for the racist comments that 
decimated her career last year.

Before cooking chicken and dumplings, Deen mopped her brow and asked the 
crowd if they minded if she talked about something serious for a moment. Without ever explicitly discussing the allegations or comments she has 
admitted making, she said she was glad to be back and that, 'I am not a 
quitter.'

The controversial chef, who was dropped by the Food Network and many sponsors after she made racist remarks, also hitched a ride on the back of fellow chef Robert Irvine

It was her first major public speech 
since private equity firm Najafi Companies invested a reported $75 to 
$100 million into new company Paula Deen Ventures earlier this month to 
help the celebrity chef revitalize her career.Â 

'We have come off of a very hard 
summer my family and I, my team, my partners,' she said to a cheering 
crowd of several hundred fans.

'But you know, I have heard on more than 
one occasion ... that I've never apologized. So if anybody did not hear 
me apologize, I would like to apologize to those who did not hear me.'

The chef, known for her calorie-laden, Southern cooking, then launched into a bizarre, on-stage performance.

At one point, she mentioned the rows of 
empty seats in the audience, something she has never seen before at the festival she has taken part in since 2005.

She also yelled out to some people
 who walked out during the show: 'Hey wait were not done! Where ya'll 
goin?'

Deen's
 career has been in shambles following a one-two punch of public 
relations disasters.

In 2012, she was criticized for announcing she had 
both diabetes and a lucrative endorsement deal for a drug to treat the 
condition she'd until then hidden.

Then last 
summer, during a legal dispute with a former employee who accused her of
 racial discrimination and sexual harassment, she acknowledged having 
used racial slurs, including the N-word, in the past.

Most of her endorsement, book and TV 
deals fell apart within days.

Deen has mostly 
stayed out of the spotlight since then, even avoiding the Food Network's
 20th anniversary party last October. But lately, she has made it clear 
she wants back.

Earlier this month, she announced that private 
investment firm Najafi Companies is investing $75 million to $100 
million to help her make a comeback.

As part 
of the deal, she's launching an umbrella company, Paula Deen Ventures, 
that will oversee her restaurants, cookbooks and product endorsements.

And Sunday's crowd seemed primed for it all, shouting out to her: 'You 
don't need to apologize!' and 'We want you back, Paula!'

'Ya'll's cards and letters that I got, helped me get out of bed every day' she replied.

Midway
 through the demo, Food Network star Robert Irvine joined Deen onstage.

Irvine survived his own scandal in in 2008 when the Food Network let him
 go over discrepancies in claims he'd made over his work experience. He 
eventually returned to the Network, seemingly unblemished.

'This
 is a warning to you,' Irvine told Deen. 'You've apologized. You've 
eaten crow. You're done. Don't do it anymore. I've been there.'

Before
 a roaring crowd, Irvine then got down on his hands and knees while Deen
 straddled his back and rode him across the stage, a reenactment of a 
gimmick they'd done during a previous festival.

'I'm back in the saddle!' she yelled to the crowd.
