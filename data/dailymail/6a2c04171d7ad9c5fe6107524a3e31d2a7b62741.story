They’re a firm favourite on dinner-plates across the country, and a Friday-night cod wouldn’t be the same without them.

But the humble chip is a food we take for granted – scoffing 382 million portions every year; fried, oven-cooked, fat ones, crinkly ones, curly ones, French ones. 

So what does it take to cook the perfect chip? This is something top chefs ponder to make this moreish sidedish retain its crown as one of Britain’s best-loved foods.

The perfect chip is made with Agria potatoes which grow in Cambridge 

As it's Potato Council's Chip Week next month (16 to 22 February) I’m at The Fish & Chip Shop, Dashwood House, Liverpool Street, to find out exactly how the professionals do it – and how we can create it in our kitchens. 

Executive chef Lee Bull tells me to start by peeling the potato and cut it lengthways into three slices, at least 1cm thick.

The slices are then cut three across, leaving me with a neat pile of nine thick, evenly-cut chips.

We’re using Agria potatoes instead of Maris Pipers or King Edwards as chef Lee is convinced it is the best tuber for chips.

‘We’ve tested 27 varieties of potato before we finally settled on this one,’ he said.

The Agria, which used to only be grown in Holland, is now grown in Cambridge.

‘While Maris Pipers have long thought to be the perfect chip potato, they can sometimes be inconsistent,’ he said.

‘The Agria however delivers 52 weeks of the year.’

To remove excess starch, the potatoes are given two cold baths. They are then carefully drained 

The chips are fried in 150°c oil for exactly six minutes before they are drained (left). They then have to rest for a minimum of two hours so that the sugars in the potato settle (right)

The potatoes are given two cold baths, which removes excess starch from them.

Next they are thoroughly drained, with Chef Lee exhorting me to shake the basket to get rid of as much water as possible.

The deep-fat fryer is heated to 150°c and the chips get their first fry. Chef Lee watches closely as I dip the chip basket into the fryer and he urges me to give it a little shake so all the chips are cooked evenly.

The chips are left to fry for exactly six minutes before I am allowed to take them out of the oil. 

I get ready to salt them but am surprised when he tells me to step away.

‘We have to leave them to grow cold,’ he says, revealing that the chips are left to rest for a minimum of two hours so that the sugar content settles down, before they are fried again.

When it comes to refrying the chips, they are swiftly plunged into 190°c oil. Without a timer I have to keep a close eye on the chip, making sure that they don’t overcook or get burnt.

Finally Chef Lee is satisfied with the way my chips look and instructs me to take them out of the fat.

‘Can you hear the sound they make? That’s how you know they’re done,’ he says to me as the golden chips tumble out of their basket and into the bowl.

I salt them, shaking the container around as I do that, so their surface is evenly coated. 

Decanted in their chip cups, Chef Lee gets first taste and nods in approval when he bites into one, slathering it in vinegar while I recklessly dip mine in ketchup.  

'Vinegar is the best condiment for a chip,' the chef says as he looks on in disapproval.  

Crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy within, I'm pleased with my first attempt at making a chip and vow to never eat a frozen fry again. Who needs to when it's this easy to make your own? 

After a second fry the golden-brown chips are tumbled out into a container and are then salted 

Ketchup or vinegar? While Chef Lee opts for the latter, the writer chooses to dip her chip in ketchup
