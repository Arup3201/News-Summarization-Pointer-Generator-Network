Found dead: Former band teacher James Nolan Owens, charged with molesting his 14-year-old student, died the day before his plea hearing

A former band teacher charged with molesting his 14-year-old student died the day before his plea hearing.

James Nolan Owens, 29, was found dead in his Lee's Summit, Missouri home on July 31, just five days ahead of his trial.

A plea hearing usually signifies the defendant is planning to plead guilty, according to The Kansas City Star.

The married man was charged in August 2012 with child enticement and second-degree child molestation.

According to court documents, Owens was arrested and charged after a woman intercepted a Facebook chat between him and a student at Missouri's William Chrisman High School in August 2012.

The student allegedly confessed to a school counselor that Owens had inappropriately touched and kissed her for at least five months, sometimes at school.

Investigators said they found past Facebook chats that contained sexually-explicit messages from Owens.

Detectives said the pair had exchanged more than 100 phone calls and about 1,520 text messages over two months in 2012.

Cops also found topless photos of the student on his computer and phone, according to court documents.

Lee’s Summit police responded to Owens’ home on a death investigation call about 1pm on July 30.

Lee's Summit Journal reported the cause of Owens death has yet to be determined by the Jackson County Medical Examiner.

His attorney, Eric Vernon, declined to comment on his client's death.

Online court records indicate Owens faced a plea hearing on July 31, not long before his August 4 trial was scheduled to begin.

A court official told the Journal the hearing had been rescheduled to August 21.

According to his obituary, Owens was born in Columbia, Missouri, and graduated with a music education degree from Missouri State University.

Owens moved to the Kansas City area in 2009, pursuing his passion for jazz music and marrying 'the love of his life'.

Owens taught at Chrisman for two years before he was dismissed following the charges.

'Our thoughts are with the families affected by Mr. Owens’ untimely death,' the school district said in a statement, according to The Kansas City Star.
