A mother has baffled doctors by beating one of the most malignant brain cancers known to man before going on to have a healthy baby girl for good measure.

Heather Knies was given just six months to live when she was diagnosed with not one, but two tumours by the age of 26 - the second one described as 'uniformly fatal'.

But now, six years later, doctors are at pains to explain how there is not a single trace of the disease left on her brain.

Mrs Knies continued to break the 'biological rules' by giving birth to daughter Zoe, now aged seven months, last year despite undergoing intense radiation that often leaves women infertile.

Mrs Knies, now 32, said God 'had a plan' for her and never once thought she would succumb to the disease.

She told ABC News: 'The mind is so much more powerful than anyone can imagine. I never once thought it would be the death of me.'

Mrs Knies was working as a doctor's receptionist in 2005 when she was diagnosed with her first cancer after she noticed visual problems driving home one day.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive malignant brain tumours.

Unlike other cancers, which are more likely to strike as patients get older, GBM is just as prevalent in young patients and kills more people under 40 than any other cancer.

Common symptoms include seizure, nausea, vomiting and headaches, although the most prevalent is a progressive memory, personality, or neurological deterioration becuase of its location near the temporal and frontal lobes.

The average sufferer will only survive for 14 months after diagnosis and 2,500 die from their tumours annually.

Glioblastoma is extremely difficult to treat for a number of reasons because the tumour cellsÂ  are very resistant to conventional therapies.

Senator Edward Kennedy, above, died from the disease in August 2009.

An MRI scan revealed a low-grade tumour pressing on her visual reception cord and she underwent successful surgery and chemotherapy.

But less than a year later, doctors discovered a stage 4 glioblastoma - a far more aggressive tumour which killed Senator Edward Kennedy in 2009.

Mrs Knies opted to have the growth partially removed as any cutting any more out left her at risk of being paralysed.

This was followed by more intense radiotherapy before being given the all-clear.

Dr Robert Spetzler, director of the Barrow Neurological Institute at Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix who operated on Mrs Knies, said he had never seen such a recovery from a stage 4 glioblastoma like it in his 35 years as a neurosurgeon.

He told ABC News: 'It's one of the most malignant tumors there is and it's uniformly fatal.

'I would not feel comfortable calling it a cure, but there is no evidence of a tumor. Her survival is remarkable.'

During her treatment, she met and married Joe Knies, a 54-year-old engineer.

They both desperately wanted children and fortunately the radiation had left some of her eggs in tact, one of which was used in a surrogate mother to give birth to Zoe.

'There have been so many miracles,' said Mrs Knies. 'One after another, as my dad said, so many angels must be sitting on my shoulders.'
