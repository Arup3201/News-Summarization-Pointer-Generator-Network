Many of us spent hours of our childhood playing in a treehouse - but how often did your parents allow you to sleep in it?

Well, now you can make up for it, thanks to a unique hotel in Sweden.

The Treehotel, located near Harads, a town in the north of the country about 40 miles south of the Arctic Circle, is about to open its largest tree room yet. In fact, it will be the biggest in the world.

The Five Leaf Clover, designed by Finnish architect Sami Rintala, is 53 square metres and weighs 20 tons. It is attached to half-a-dozen pine trees six metres above the ground.

Inside, it can house up to six people in three bedrooms, and even comes with conference facilities for 12 people. Guests reach the room via a two-storey high staircase. 

The Five Leaf Clover, due to open on December 20, is just the latest tree room at the hotel, which boasts beautiful views of the tall pine forests around the Lule River.

The Treehotel is far enough north to offer spectacular glimpses of the Northern Lights at certain times of the year.

Ample space: The 20-ton 'Five Leaf Clover' room - the world's largest - will sleep up to six people in three bedrooms and also includes conference facilities

Other quirky rooms at the hotel include 'The Bird's Nest' - a cabin completely camouflaged by thatch and branches only accessible by a retractable staircase.

Another one is 'The UFO', a space-age metal capsule on two floors which sleeps four people.

The Treehotel also has Pensionat serving breakfast, lunch and dinner in a 1930s-1950s setting, as well as offering internet, television, restaurant and bar.

Hidden in the forest is an eight-person 'Tree Sauna' complete with a hot tub and relaxation area.

Groundbreaking: Plans of the new room, which is just the latest uniquely-designed accommodation at the Treehotel

Speaking about the new room, Treehotel CEO and co-founder Kent Lindvall said: 'Treehotel always strive to push limits with our environmental work, architecture and engineering.

'The Five Leaf Clover is clear evidence of this as nothing remotely similar has ever been done before.'

A night at the Treehotel costs 3300 Krona (£306) for one person and 4400 Krona (£408) for two people, inclusive of breakfast.
