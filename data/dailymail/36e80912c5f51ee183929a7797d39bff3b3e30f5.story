Devastated: Melanie Coffee told family members she has yet to come to terms with the death of her son Wyatt as she recovers from her own injuries

Tragedy: Wyatt, Melanie's first child, died in the crash. His mother made desperate attempts to revive him

Her uncle Ayo Coffee said: 'She is heartbroken. This is a tragedy for her and all the family.'

Coffee has been hailed a hero for walking over a mile in blizzard like conditions to reach rescuers after the light aircraft she was travelling in plunged to the ground.

The young mum had desperately tried to revive her son Wyatt before going for help and guiding rescue workers back to the crash site.

Three others, including the pilot, died when the regular shuttle flight from a remote south west Alaska town crashed on Friday evening. She was the only one of six survivors who could make the arduous journey.

Coffee is being comforted by her partner Keith Andrew at a hospital in Anchorage where she underwent an operation on her arm. She also suffered chest injuries.

Wyatt was the first child for 32-year- old Andrew and Coffee.

'Melanie is heartbroken and is coming to terms with what's happened. The family are rallying round her,' said her uncle Alo Coffee.

'Her mother is at the hospital and by her side. When we spoke she said she was holding up.

'We are all still trying to take in what has happened.'

Coffee's mother Daisy was too upset to talk when contacted on her cell phone by MailOnline.

She has earlier told the Anchorage Daily News she was not yet blaming anyone for the crash, adding: 'Because nothing can bring the baby back to life.'

Despite her injuries and grief Coffee updated her photograph on Facebook posting a picture of her alongside her partner Keith and another of Wyatt after the crash.

Friends posted messages of support, but Melanie did not make any online comment.

The vice-mayor of the Mountain Village, the isolated town where Melanie lived, paid tribute to her heroism.

Peter Andrew also said her friends were still coming to terms with her son's death and that of three others.

Beloved: Vice-mayor of Mountain Village Peter Andrew, said: 'Melanie cherished her son. She must be utterly devastated. But she was a hero. She went to get help even though she must have been distraught'

'Melanie cherished her son. She must be utterly devastated,' said Andrew.

'But she was a hero. She went to get help even though she must have been distraught.

'I cannot begin to imagine what she is going through right now. All we can do is offer our love and support.'

Andrew, who was only elected a month ago, said grief counsellors could be sent to the town, about 400 miles from Anchorage, to help the 800 residents.

'Everyone knows each other in Mountain Village,' he said.

'It is a very small community so something as big and tragic as this has a huge impact.

'People are struggling to come to terms with the accident. We are all in shock.No way would we have thought something like this would have happened.'

Horror: Wyatt was sitting on his mother's lap and is thought to have been unrestrained when the single engine plane came down about four miles from the airfield at St Marys

Melanie is being treated at the Alaska Regional Hospital in Anchorage along with the others who survived.

Melanie and eight other passengers had been making a ten minute flight from Bethel to to the nearby village of St Marys when the Cessna 208 came down in poor visibility.

It was supposed to land at Mountain Village, but for reasons yet to be revealed did not make its scheduled stop.

Eye witnesses said the plane had flown low over the airfield at St Mary's and then disappeared.

The cause of the crash was unknown and light aircraft like the Cessna 208 do not carry black box recorders that are standard on commercial airliners to record instrument data.

Wyatt was sitting on his mother's lap and is thought to have been unrestrained when the single engine plane came down about four miles from the airfield at St Marys.

Coffee called A health worker in Mountain Village on her cell phone to ask for help in resuscitating her son while also alerting them to the crash.

Pain: the vice-mayor told MailOnline: 'I cannot begin to imagine what she is going through right now. All we can do is offer our love and support'

When that failed she set out through fog and freezing rain to try and raise the alarm.

Alaska State Troopers said she followed the red flashing light of a beacon to reach the town of St Marys where she was met by rescue teams making their way out into the darkness.

She guided rescuers back to the crash site where more than 50 people from St Marys and Mountain Village,who had heard about the crash, and joined in the rescue effort.

Many had driven through the freezing conditions on snowmobiles and in their vehicles to try and reach the crash site.

Paramedics who arrived were helped by the villagers load the stretchers with the injured.

Those who survived suffered broken bones and head injuries consistent with a sudden impact.

Alaska State Troopers named the dead as pilot Terry Hansen,68, passengers Richard Polty,65 and his wife Rose,57, and Wyatt Coffee.

The survivors were named as Pauline Johnson,37 and her 14 year old son Kylan,Tanya Lawrence,35,Shannon Lawrence and 35 year old Garrett Moses.

An investigator from the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Authority arrived at the crash site.

Bad weather had initially hampered their arrival over the weekend as they were unable to fly from Bethel.

The crash site remained roped off with Mountain Village Public Safety Office James Sartelle guarding the site.

Regular route: The plane, similar to this Hageland Aviation Cessna 208, was making a scheduled flight

The town's vice Mayor said the shuttle flights from the remote village was often the only way for villagers to get around during the winter.

Flying from Mountain Village to St Mary takes ten minutes by air but villagers can spend over an hour navigating the small country roads.

During the winter month many are impassable.

'The villages rely on the shuttle service. This has had a huge impact,' said Andrews.

The flight that crashed was operated by Hageland Air.

A statement issued on behalf of Hageland Air President said: 'Hageland is working to gather information to answer questions and do what we can to ease the suffering of those involved in the accident.

'As a family owned business this is an unspeakable tragedy for us.'
