Wayne Rooney has buried the hatchet with Sir Alex Ferguson over the fallout that almost led to him quitting Manchester United a year ago.

The relationship between the two men deteriorated in Ferguson’s final season in charge after United brought in Robin van Persie from Arsenal and played Rooney out of position.

It came to a head when the England striker was sensationally axed for a vital Champions League tie against Real Madrid and subsequently told Ferguson that he felt his future lay away from Old Trafford.

The United boss further angered the Rooney camp by making that public before his final home game in charge, and the club had to fend off bids of up to £30million from Chelsea before Rooney performed a U-turn and signed a new long-term deal worth £300,000-a-week.

Now captain under Louis van Gaal and celebrating a decade at Old Trafford, Rooney has thanked Ferguson for the pivotal role he played in his career. 

‘He was vitally important,’ Rooney told MUTV in an interview to mark his 10 years at the club. ‘I’m grateful to him for having the faith to bring me in from Everton.

‘I think he’s an incredible person and manager, the way you see his desire for the game. He certainly helped me a lot and helped us all.

‘At the time I was coming into the squad as a young lad and there were a few other young lads. He brought all that together and made us world (club) champions. I’m very grateful for everything he’s done.’

Recalling his £25million move from Everton on transfer deadline day in 2004 when he was just 18, Rooney added: ‘It was a great feeling. Sir Alex is the best manager there’s been and for him to recognise my talent and want me to join this club was a great honour for me.

‘I was nervous of course. It was a bit weird because I met him here at the training ground and then went to finalise it at Old Trafford. He drove me over, just the two of us in his car. I remember being nervous but he was great and made me feel comfortable.

‘I’m a strong-minded person and sometimes you have to make tough decisions. No-one else could make it for me. It was down to me whether I left Everton and I made my agent aware and told my parents that I was going to join Manchester United. I had no regrets doing that.

'It was tougher for my family who stayed in Liverpool whereas I moved to Manchester but that’s part of football.’

Rooney insists that he intends seeing out his current five-year deal to extend his United career to 15 years.

He added: ‘I hope so. I think the plan is I’ve just signed new long-term deal at the club and hopefully in five years’ time we’ll be sat down for a 15-year one (interview). I don’t see any reason why not.’
