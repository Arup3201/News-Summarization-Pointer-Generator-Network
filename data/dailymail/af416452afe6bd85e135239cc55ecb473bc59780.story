Andy Murray has been spotted out and about for the first time since landing in Heathrow on Tuesday after the tumultuous Australian Open.

But as he and fiancee Kim Sears donned wellies, hats and fleeces for a snowy dog-walk, his four-set defeat by Novak Djokovic on Sunday was a world away.

The couple strolled with their border terriers Maggie May and Rusty near their £5 million home in Oxshott, Surrey, yesterday.

Andy Murry and Kim Sears enjoyed a stroll through snow-covered Oxshott yesterday afternoon 

The 27-year-old Scot smiled as he walked and chatted to Kim, although at one point he checked his phone before his hands got too cold and he put them back in his pockets.

Andy wore a black wool beanie and a grey jumper over a zip up top. His trousers were by Under Armour, the US clothing brand he has a four-year deal with.

Both he and Kim, 27, wore matching navy Hunter wellies but she held on to the dogs' leads.

The pet portrait artist pulled her hair into a loose bun but protected her ears with a grey headband.

A burgundy, grey and black scarf was knotted around her neck but she kept her navy jacket, worn over a loose grey top, open.

She wore snug claret-coloured trousers and matching gloves for their walk before they climbed into a grey Land Rover and drove away.

This is the first sighting of the pair since landing in Heathrow after Andy's four-set defeat in Melbourne

The walk will no doubt have done wonders for their jet lag after a 24-hour flight back from Australia, which is 11 hours ahead of the UK.

Andy was in the country for two weeks competing for the Grand Slam title with Kim by his side.  

And while Andy's defeat at the final hurdle grabbed headlines, it was also an eventful tournament in Australia for his fiancee Kim Sears.

During the semi-finals she whipped up a storm of controversy after she was seen swearing in an expletive-filled tirade at Czech player Tomas Berdych live on national television.

Despite his defeat to Novak Djokovic, Andy seemed to be in good spirits, smiling and chatting on the walk 

The couple wore matching navy Hunter wellies and Kim swept her blonde locks into a loose messy bun 

But she revealed her self-deprecating sense of humour the following day when she wore a black T-shirt with the phrase, 'Parental Advisory Explicit Content'.

Kim, Andy's partner of nine years, became an internet sensation with social media erupting with messages of approval.

Nigel Sears, a coach and pundit, was asked about his daughter's expletive-filled tirade as she watched fiancée Andy Murray overcome Thomas Berdych in a heated Australian Open semi-final on Thursday.

The 57-year-old joked: 'she's always had a potty mouth - gets it from her mother of course' before expressing his surprise that Miss Sears' 'feisty' support had created such a furore.

Kim was in charge of the dogs as they strolled on the snow-covered grounds, leading the Border terriers 

Ever gracious in defeat, Andy tweeted after the match, 'Ready to take off back 2 London.Thanks 2 everyone @ausopen for making it such a special event, well done on number 5 Novak incredible record.'

Adding once he landed: 'Thanks to everyone who's been supporting me and believing in me after a tough year. I'll keep working hard to get better....Treat yourself. 

After their long walk, the pair were seen climbing back into a grey Land Rover
