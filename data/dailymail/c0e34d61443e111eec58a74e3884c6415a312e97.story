Cristiano Ronaldo was an isolated figure, and here is his heat map

Another spell-binding afternoon to further light up this thrill-a-minute World Cup. In the end, though, it is hard to conclude that this one taught us much we didn’t already know.

Germany remain the consummate tournament team. When weren’t they? This was their seventh consecutive victory in opening matches at the World Cup. On five of those occasions they have scored four goals. Really, we should not be surprised.

Portugal, meanwhile, are a skittish collection of individuals. Some are talented and some really are not. It was ever thus.

At the heart of their ordinary defence is Real Madrid’s thuggish Pepe. Sent off here, we may not see him again this tournament and we shall not miss him.

It appears Cristiano Ronaldo’s dream 
year will not be capped by a rampage across Brazil. He was modest at 
best yesterday but it was hard to blame him. Any talent — no matter how 
divine — needs a platform on which to function.

He
 is a diamond surrounded by some pretty ugly rocks and even if Portugal 
do recover to beat USA and Ghana it is hard to imagine them moving 
beyond the last 16.

That 
cannot be said of Germany. This was a remarkable performance on a 
devastatingly hot day. Certainly they were helped by Pepe’s dismissal, 
delivered by Serbian referee Milorad Mazic for a mindless butt on Thomas Muller.

Portugal manager Paulo Bento appeared to question the referee’s objectivity in deciding to send Pepe off. That was rubbish.

Germany
 were already two goals to the good by that time, anyway. All Pepe’s act
 of madness did was allow them to ease off a little with almost an hour 
left to play.

Such was the 
German superiority that Sami Khedira was able to play 90 minutes when 
the plan had been to take him off after 45. He was superb — so, too, 
Mario Gotze and, of course, Muller.

Germany
 played with purpose and identity. As he did four years ago, Joachim Low
 — their splendidly understated coach — appears to have brought them to 
the start line in prime condition.

Early
 on, Portugal briefly threatened. One scamper down the left by Ronaldo 
allowed Hugo Almeida to shoot tamely at Manuel Neuer, while another 
break saw the Portugal captain drive in a low effort.

Bento’s team never seemed to settle across their own back line, however, and they almost gifted Germany the lead very early on.

A
 back pass which Pepe played without looking took goalkeeper Rui 
Patricio away from his line. When his hurried, scuffed clearance landed 
at Khedira’s feet 35 yards from goal, the Real Madrid midfielder struck 
the ball first time only to see it pass outside the post by a few 
inches.

Soon afterwards came
 Germany’s opening goal. Perhaps Gotze was leaning in to Joao Pereira a 
little as the two men tussled in the area, but the Portuguese defender 
did seem to have a grip of his opponent. After Gotze fell down, Muller 
stepped up to stroke the penalty in.

So
 early in the game, it already looked a long way back for Portugal and, 
in their own half at least, things quickly deteriorated.

Gotze
 looked about to score in the 31st minute as he moved on to Mesut Ozil’s
 low cross, only for Pereira to divert the shot over with his knee. It 
was a fine block but one that was rendered irrelevant within 30 seconds 
as Mats Hummels rose above Pepe to thump in a header from the resulting 
corner.

Two down now, Portugal certainly seemed doomed. By half-time they were.

Twice
 in a minute they came close to scoring as Fabio Coentrao inexplicably 
chose not to shoot when clear and then substitute Eder — on for the 
injured Almeida — headed a corner over. Almost immediately Pepe 
contributed his piece of madness and Germany were left with a man 
advantage.

Perhaps the arm 
in the face of Muller was not quite enough to put the German on the seat
 of his pants. But Pepe is no stranger to a bit of method acting himself
 and the decision to follow up with a nudge of his head was ridiculous. 
Within seconds he was back in the dressing room.

All
 that remained now was to see how much more pain Germany could inflict. 
Quite a bit as it turned out. Muller poked in the third just before half
 time after anticipating well to block a Bruno Alves clearance and 
Muller was able to score his third when Patricio couldn’t hold an Andre 
Schurrle effort with 15 minutes left.

By this time, Coentrao had departed with what looked to be a serious thigh injury and Portugal’s misery was complete.

They don’t look like they will be with us for long. Germany, on the other hand, have started with menace once again.
