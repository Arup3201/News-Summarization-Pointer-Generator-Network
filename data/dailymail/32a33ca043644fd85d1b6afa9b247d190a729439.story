Paul Scholes reckons Wayne Rooney should get the nod to become the new Manchester United captain ahead of Robin van Persie.

The former Red Devil says the England star is the best candidate to succeed Nemanja Vidic and skipper the side for the forthcoming season.

But Scholes believes Van Persie will get the green light from compatriot Louis van Gaal.

Contender: Wayne Rooney is one of the candidates for the armband at Old Trafford

Favourite: Louis van Gaal could give compatriot Robin van Persie the captaincy 

He said: 'I think he [Van Gaal] will give it [the captaincy] to Robin [Van Persie]. He’s had a lot of experience with him from Holland. He knows him well, knows him as a player, but personally I would probably go for Rooney.

'He’s always struck me as the type who could be a captain and now is the perfect time to give him the responsibility I know he is capable of taking. And the same goes for England. With both teams, there is not an outstanding candidate for the role.'

Scholes says there is no stand-out contender for the role at Old Trafford, unlike United's Premier League rivals.

But the 39-year-old believes Rooney should be given the chance to lead the team.

'If you look at Manchester City, Kompany stands out a mile,' he told talkSPORT.

Staking a claim: Rooney has had the opportunity to impress his new boss on their pre-season tour to the US

'Look at Chelsea and John Terry stands out a mile. Look at Liverpool and Steven Gerrard stands out a mile. There isn’t really an obvious candidate for Manchester United or England.

'I’d like to see Wayne given that chance. Possibly I think he might get it for England, but I think Van Gaal might go for Robin.'
