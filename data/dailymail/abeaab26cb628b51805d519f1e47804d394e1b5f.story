From right down south in Tierra del Fuego, from the capital Buenos Aires
 and from Lionel Messi’s home town in Rosario, they are arriving in Rio de 
Janeiro in camper vans, minibuses and beaten-up old cars.

They are 
even opening up Sambodromo, where the Carnival normally takes place, to 
accommodate them all as they stream into the city.

They are an 
invading army of Argentine hopefuls, brought here by a desire to be 
present at an historic coronation. Flights are full so the only way to 
be part of the show is to settle down for the long drive — two days from
 Buenos Aires — up through the country and into Brazil.

Influential: Lionel Messi is carrying a nation at World Cup as Diego Maradona once did

And almost to a man, woman and child, their Argentina shirts bear the names of two men, representing the past and the present: Diego Maradona and Messi.

Messi is carrying a nation here in Rio de Janeiro as Maradona once did. As Jorge Valdano, the 1986 World Cup winner, wrote: ‘As in  politics, in Argentina we are always looking for one man to save us. If Argentina win, the people will crown him with laurels; if not they will give him a crown of thorns.’

And it has been a mixed World Cup so far for the world’s greatest player. Messi carried the team through the group; he provided the crucial assist against Switzerland in the last 16; he was by far the most influential player against Belgium in the quarter-finals; by the semi-final, though, he looked fatigued, jaded and unable to offer much energy to the team.

‘My only fear is that the kid is tired, but in the final game you cannot be tired,’ said Maradona of his heir. ‘He’ll understand that. 
Even if he doesn’t score, he will be the best in the world, just the 
same.’

Messi has had a season disrupted by a hamstring injury at 
Barcelona. He does not look to have the energy levels he displayed a few
 years ago when Pep Guardiola convinced him to contribute to Barcelona’s
 pressing game. Here he has been a different player, performing deeper, 
rather than as the farthest forward striker, and has influenced 
midfield.

The semi-final against Holland was played in trying 
circumstances for the Argentina team. They had woken up on the morning 
of the game to tragic news that Argentine journalist Jorge Lopez had 
died in a car crash in Sao Paulo the night before. Lopez knew many of 
the squad and even shared a flat briefly with Messi in Barcelona when 
the player was still a teenage hopeful.

For Valdano, though, too 
much  rests on one man. ‘How can we build a competitive team? How can we
 fulfil expectations? How can we make up for the lack of intensity, the 
lack of goals? Until now, the answer to all these questions has been in 
one man: Messi,’ wrote Valdano after the group stages. ‘But the name 
that captivates Argentinians and dazzles the world, frustrates the 
manager, who is trying to ensure that the team is more solid behind Leo,
 to create more options and mobility up front.

‘If the manager can 
get a collective unit playing well, then he can have confidence in the 
team rather than continually hoping for the inspiration from the No10.’

That
 manager, Alex Sabella, has stiffened up his team by bringing in Lucas 
Biglia alongside Javier Mascherano, which has brought greater defensive 
balance to the line-up. Ezequiel Garay has been a sturdy presence at the
 back and Martin Demichelis, alongside him, a surprisingly calming 
presence.

But it is still Messi who elevates this Argentina team from
 being merely a good one to potential World Cup winners, especially in 
the likely absence of Angel Di Maria and the limited fitness of Sergio 
Aguero.

‘He represents 80 per cent of our creative capacity,’ said 
Cesar Menotti, the 1978 World Cup-winning coach. ‘He can solve the match
 in just one second. Even though the Germans can create more space, 
Argentina enjoys the luxury of having Messi, which the Germans lack.’

That said, Menotti has also compared Germany with the Brazilian side of 1970, indicating the size of the task Argentina face.

‘Even
 after a bad season with Barcelona, Leo turned out to be the man at the 
World Cup,’ said Mario Kempes, Menotti’s principal striker in that 1978 
World Cup win. ‘He won’t be able to do it alone, but I’m sure he will 
show his best form in the final game. He is wonderful.’

While Gary 
Lineker doubts that Messi is at his physical peak here, he concedes that
 even if not at 100 per cent he could still intimidate Germany. England 
felt similarly cowed facing Maradona in their World Cup quarter-final in
 1986, according to Lineker.

‘Subconsciously, you know what you’re up
 against: a phenomenal talent,’ said Lineker. ‘There was a feeling if he
 (Maradona) had a bad day then you’ve got half a chance. I’m sure it 
would be the same now if you played against Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. 
They score a goal a game.

‘The Germans will know that and I’m sure 
they’ll make plans for that, but it’s hard to change your entire system 
for someone. But when I look at him at the moment, I think he’s quite 
easy to mark.’

Maybe Messi has done enough simply be getting to the 
final to  satisfy the honour of Argentinians. It is noticeable that the 
Germans, losing finalists in 2002 and semi-finalists in 2006 and 2010, 
have greeted every victory here with an understated sense of 
satisfaction.

For this generation of German players, only victory 
today will mark a job well done. They will not accept another glorious 
failure.

‘Normally after a 7-1 victory you would be really happy,’ 
said  Arsenal’s Per Mertesacker following the semi-final against Brazil.
 ‘But we were all subdued. Only the final matters to us now and that 
comes down to winning or losing.’

By contrast, Argentina were 
euphoric even to win their quarter-final, ending what they regarded as a
 24-year curse of not making the last four. Clearly their semi-final was
 a degree more tense than  Germany’s, but it has unleashed a cascade of 
euphoria in Argentina, prompting the march on Rio.

Mascherano spoke of his soul  soaring upon reaching the final. Gonzalo Higuain was similarly  emotive.

‘We
 are just one little step from writing eternal history for our 
football,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to explain and this is a unique moment.’

Perhaps
 it is simply the difference in how Germanic and Latin cultures express 
themselves, but the Argentines have been noticeably more effusive. But 
now that the massed ranks are here, there is only one result imaginable.
 And that means one man will shoulder the responsibility. Even Valdano, 
who preaches the virtues of the team above the individual, might concede
 that.

Prior to the World Cup he was asked who was the best player in
 the world and, of course, selected Messi. And who’s the second best, he
 was asked? ‘Messi injured,’ he replied.
