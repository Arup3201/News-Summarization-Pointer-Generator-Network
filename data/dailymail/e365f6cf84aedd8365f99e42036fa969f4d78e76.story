The U.S. military is preparing for a long-range missile attack on Syrian government targets, it was claimed today. 

The revelation comes as evidence piles up that the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad was behind the suspected chemical weapons attack Wednesday that killed an estimated 1,500 Syrians in a Damascus suburb.

The preparation for a military strike could mean that President Barack Obama intends to make good on his threat of 'enormous consequences' if Assad crossed the 'red line' of using chemical weapons against his own people.

Warning: Graphic images

Ship-launched cruise missiles have a range of up to 1,500 miles - more than enough to reach Syrian government targets

Dozens of children appear among the dead bodies piled up in Ghouta, Syria. These victims, who appear to bear no physical injuries, were killed by a nerve gas attack launched by the Syrian government, rebels say

The Syrian rebels have worked to send pictures of the hundreds of dead across the world in an attempt to spur a military response and help them oust Bashar al-Assad from power

CBS News reports that 'The Pentagon is making initial preparations for a missile attack on Syrian government forces.'

Commanders of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean ordered warships to move closer to Israel, so they would be in better striking range to hit forces in Syria. The maximum range for Tomahawk Cruise Missiles is about 1,500 miles.

Possible targets include command bunkers and missile sites that could be used to launch chemical-tipped missiles.

Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey is expect to present the 
plan for a missile strike to Obama at a national security meeting on 
Saturday.

CBS News points out that the missile strikes would likely be more tactical than strategic. They are unlikely to topple, or even significantly destabilize Assad's regime.

Serious decisions: President Barack Obama said that he will be taking action over the attack on Wednesday where chemical weapons were used

Defiant: President Bashar al-Assad has denied that his government used chemical weapons and blamed the attack on rebel forces

Instead,
U.S. generals are hoping that such an attack could send a message to 
Assad - and also thwart future chemical weapons attacks.

Still,
the president played down the likelihood of a unilateral attack on 
Syrian government forces and seemed reticent to use military force. 

'If the U.S. goes in and attacks another country without a U.N. mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented, then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it - "do we have the coalition to make it work?"' he told CNN in an interview broadcast Friday. 

United Nations Security Council backing for a strike on Assad seems unlikely. Russia, which has veto power, is a staunch supporter of the Syrian government and has blocked any decisive action against Assad thus far.

CBS News also reported U.S. intelligence assets detected activity at known Syrian chemical weapons facilities before the attack Wednesday. 

On Friday National Security Adviser Susan Rice tweeted that the mass casualties in Damascus were an 'apparent chemical weapons attack.'

'What is Bashar al Assad hiding? The world is demanding an independent investigation of Wednesday’s apparent CW attack. Immediately,' she wrote.

The Syrian regime has strongly denied that it has used chemical weapons, however the regime refuses to allow United Nations inspectors into the country to examine to site and confirm whether chemical weapons were used.
