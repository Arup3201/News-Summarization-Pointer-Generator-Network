Senior Labour party officials are said to be overhauling Ed Miliband's geeky image and presenting him as dull but competent

Labour is to present Ed Miliband as a ‘Mr Normal’ figure at the next election – in a bid to make a virtue of his lack of charisma.

Senior party lieutenants concede that efforts to overhaul the Labour leader’s geeky image have largely failed, and are now drawing up plans to promote him as a dull but competent alternative to David Cameron.

Opinion polls show Mr Miliband trails Mr Cameron badly when voters are asked who is more suited to the job of Prime Minister.

The Conservatives have made no secret of the fact they plan to make the 2015 general election campaign a presidential-style fight, in which they will highlight Mr Miliband’s perceived weaknesses.

His public image is so bad that one Labour frontbencher told the Daily Mail he should be replaced by animated characters in party political broadcasts.

But aides believe Mr Cameron’s ‘flash’ personality can be countered if Mr Miliband adopts an ‘authentic’ approach.

His wife Justine Thornton is expected to be given a much higher profile during the campaign to boost his image as a family man.

A senior Labour source said: ‘He has to be authentic – there’s no point trying to pretend he’s something he’s not. Ed is a family man who loves spending time at home with his wife and kids. He’s just very normal.

‘We tried this kind of approach with Gordon Brown, but Ed is an easier sell than Gordon.’

Labour is studying the 1977 New York mayoral race, in which the then little-known Democrat Ed Koch successfully ran on the slogan: ‘Eight years of charisma ... why not try competence?’

But the party’s past efforts to portray Gordon Brown as ‘Not Flash, Just Gordon’ in 2010 were not enough to save him from a crushing defeat at the general election.

In an interview with Labour Uncut website yesterday, former party leader Lord Kinnock acknowledged that Mr Miliband comes across as ‘weird’.

He said: ‘Well yes he’s weird, but then so were Churchill and Wilson, and Thatcher was the weirdest of the lot ... he’s brave, he’s brainy and he’s measured.’

Meanwhile Mr Miliband was warned to avoid being humiliated like Neil Kinnock if he visits the US.

The Labour leader is said to be ‘very keen’ to meet Barack Obama to show voters he has the bearing of a prime minister.

His dream may even have come a step closer after he hired former Obama strategist David Axelrod.

But Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair’s former chief of staff, said a Washington trip was ‘the nearest the leader of the opposition gets to a job interview for prime minister’, adding: ‘If it goes wrong there are serious consequences. Neil Kinnock proved that.’

After Mr Kinnock went to see President Reagan in 1987, Labour put it out that the meeting had gone very well.

But the trip turned to disaster when the White House revealed Mr Reagan’s concerns about Mr Kinnock’s desire for unilateral  nuclear disarmament. In 2009, Mr Obama refused five requests for a meeting with Gordon Brown.
