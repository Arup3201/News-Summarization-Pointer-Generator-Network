For a city with some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, the sudden opening of a gun store on New York's Lower East Side raised eyebrows.

The GWH Gun Shop was open for only two days last week and had a very specific purpose - to put people off buying guns.

Potential shoppers were lured in by a large sign in the window that stated: 'First-time gun buyer? We are here to help you.' 

In the apparently well-stocked store, in a space usually used as an art gallery, each gun is labelled with information about how that make and model was used in a particular tragedy.

The 'sales pitches' from the actor posing as the store clerk are brutal and hidden cameras captured the startled reactions of customers.

The store opened overnight in a space usually used as an art gallery in New York's Lower East Side

The authentic looking store was filled with guns, clothing and accessories, but no live ammo was on site

Many of the shoppers that entered the store were potential first-time gun owners looking to buy a weapon for primarily for protection

'Collectors love this one. Adam Lanza's mom had this in her collection, too, until he took this and several other guns and killed her and then went down to Sandy Hook and killed six teachers and 20 innocent children. Twenty little kids…Gone like that.'

For a customer interested in ease of use he said: 'This revolver, it's the easiest gun we have to use. It's our most popular one. It's a .22-caliber, six-inch revolver. It's also a gun that a five-year-old found in his parents' bedroom, went down and shot his nine-month-old baby brother with it.'

In another part of the video he showed a 9mm semi-automatic weapon to a customer: 'A very handy gun. Easy to use. It's a great gun to carry in your purse, like that gal from the Walmart, her two-year-old son reaches into her pocketbook, pulls it out, shoots her.'

The store - and its accompanying website, Guns With History - were part of a campaign put together by States United to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun control non-profit organization and New Yorkers Against Gun Violence, one of their affiliates.

The 'sales pitches' from the actor posing as the store clerk are brutal descriptions of tragedies committed with the make and model of the weapon

All the weapons, which were unloaded movie props, also have a tag with information about the tragedy to which the clerk refers - the descriptions are also on the related website

Hidden cameras captured the reactions of potential first-time gun owners to the 'sales pitches'

Customers were visibly shocked or upset by the descriptions of gun accidents and mass shootings

Working with Grey, a New York-base agency, and production company Rival School Pictures, the goal was to ensure that people are aware of how many accidents and tragedies occur as a result of having a gun in a home.

The groups were also particularly keen to reach out to parents. 

The pro-gun lobby was quick to label the stunt as misleading.

'This is a tasteless PR stunt designed to further an anti-gun agenda, and it's out of touch with reality,' National Rifle Association spokeswoman Jennifer Baker told FoxNews.com.

'As gun ownership has risen to an all-time high, violent crime has fallen to a 43-year low, and the firearm accident death rate has fallen to the lowest that it has been in over a hundred years.'

'A clear majority of the American people support the use of firearms for protection and put more faith in gun ownership rights than in gun control.'

Julia Wyman, executive director of SUPGV said: 'Our aim is to ensure those looking to purchase a firearm are aware of the potential risks [and to promote responsible gun ownership].'

'Often gun purchasers wrongly believe guns will keep them safe when, in fact, a gun in the home greatly increases the risk of homicide and suicide.'

'This sets the record straight so consumers can make an informed choice to buy a firearm or not.'

The store has an accompanying website which carries the same information

Potential shoppers found the information sobering
