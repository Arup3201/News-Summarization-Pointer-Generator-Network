Two wild teenagers paid the hefty price for a dangerous joyride in a tin boat that quickly turned sour when the authorities caught up with the daring duo.

A police helicopter on a routine patrol spotted the two brazen youths shamelessly hooning along the Nerang river in Broadbeach Waters on the Gold Coast in Queensland at 11.30am on Wednesday.

The boys, aged 14 and 15, can be seen flying along in the tinnie at a frightening pace while swerving from side to side and almost hitting the jetties of exclusive homes along the waterfront and narrowly missing a luxurious yacht moored on the foreshore.

Two wild teenagers paid the hefty price for a dangerous joyride in a tin boat that quickly turned sour when the authorities caught up with the daring duo

Police released the aerial footage of the two brazen youths shamelessly hooning along the Nerang river in Broadbeach Waters on the Gold Coast in Queensland at 11.30am on Wednesday

The boys, aged 14 and 15, can be seen flying along in the tinnie at a frightening pace almost hitting the jetties of exclusive homes along the waterfront and narrowly missing a luxurious yacht moored on the foreshore

The boat was clocked travelling at 20 knots, or 37km/h, in a 6 knot (11km/h) 'wake-free' zone along the usually calm and quite river.

After 15 minutes of reckless driving, the boat is seen gliding onto a sandy embankment before coming to an abrupt stop just metres from a parked bus alongside a busy road.

The boys get out of the boat and make a run for it but the marine police officers catch up with them not too far from where they abandoned the tinnie.

The 14 -year-old boy, who was driving the tinnie, was charged with speeding, driving unlicensed and not wearing a lifejacket.
