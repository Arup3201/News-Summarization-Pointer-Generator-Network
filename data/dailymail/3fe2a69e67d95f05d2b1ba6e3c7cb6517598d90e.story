Clubs who consider signing convicted rapist Ched Evans should take fans’ feelings into account first, according to Oldham Athletic director Barry Owen.

Owen brought Lee Hughes to his club in 2007, who had been jailed for causing death by dangerous driving.

Now debate has risen over whether Evans, who has been linked with a return to Sheffield United, should be allowed back into the game.

‘We were very mindful of the fans’ thoughts,’ said Owen.

Ched Evans did not have his contract renewed at Sheffield United when it expired in 2012

‘One of the major points for us was that Lee had shown a lot of repentance for what he had done. That played a big role in our thinking.

‘A lot depends on the public perception of the crime and the type of offence.

‘It’s up to Sheffield United what they do. What I would say is that the law states that this man can be employed again.’

Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister has warned club bosses they cannot ‘wish away’ the Evans’ rape conviction and must remember that the players are not just a footballers but role models to millions of fans.

An online petition against Evans return to Sheffield United had attracted 90,000 supporters at the weekend, but by last night, more than 145,000 had put their names to it.

The petition, set up by feminist campaigner Jean Hatchet, calls on Kevin McCabe, chairman of Sheffield United, where Evans played until he was jailed, to ‘refuse to reinstate Ched Evans as a player’.

It argues: ‘To even consider reinstating him as a player at the same club is a deep insult to the woman who was raped and to all women like her who have suffered at the hands of a rapist.’

Today Mr Clegg, an MP in Sheffield, appeared to suggest that he thought the club was wrong to offer Evans a way back.

Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in, Mr Clegg told LBC: ‘I think the owners need to think really long and hard about that fact that when you take a footballer on, you are not taking just a footballer these days you are also taking on a role model.

‘You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on the football pitch on a team like that, and he has committed a very, very serious crime.’

Mr Clegg repeatedly insisted it was a decision for the club and not for politicians, but added: ‘I really do think that footballers these days, they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people.

‘My opinion is this; rape is an incredibly serious offence, unbelievably serious offence.

‘He has done his time but I just don’t believe that the owners of the football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened.

‘And that is what he will be known for and that is something which, particularly for the youngsters following that team they will always be aware of.

‘I think football players these days, they get paid a lot of money, they are public figures and you can’t ignore that.’

Rather than sack Evans when he was jailed, Sheffield United instead chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 2012

And boss Nigel Clough says bringing him back to Bramall Lane should be a decision taken by the owner and not at football level.

‘We have had one or two discussions, we are awaiting a decision and the owners will make that in good time.’ Clough said.

Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough said the decision lies entirely with the club's board

‘I have been involved in decisions, but it is very much a decision for the owners and when the time is right to say something as a club we will do that.

‘It is that sort of decision - it’s above football level.

‘It’s my decision whether to put him in the team if he comes back, it’s not my decision whether he comes back in the first place - that’s theirs.

‘Until the decision is made there is no point talking about it.

‘It’s not been distraction within the camp. First of all he’s not out yet and secondly the club haven’t made a decision and until those two things happen it is irrelevant.’
