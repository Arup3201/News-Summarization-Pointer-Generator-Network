A self-proclaimed obese photographer has told how an intimate self-portrait project inspired her to lose 110pounds.

Jen Davis, 35, based in Brooklyn, New York, spent a decade snapping herself in ordinary situations in a bid to learn about 'her place in the world' as an overweight individual.

But she explained to ABC News that it wasn't until she enlarged the images for an art exhibition that she was 'really freaked out' by what she saw.

In the spotlight: Self-proclaimed obese photographer Jen Davis said that her intimate self-portrait project was what inspired her to finally shed 110pounds - this image shows her in 2004

Feeling like a new woman: In 2011 Miss Davis underwent lap-band surgery, started dieting and took up exercise

'I came to the 
conclusion I wanted to know what it feels like to live . . . I didn’t realize how uncomfortable I was, how big I was,' she recalled.

The prospect of turning 40 and still struggling with her size, which had been a battle since childhood, also filled her with horror.

In the summer of 2011 she underwent lap-band surgery and fully committed to altering her lifestyle. As well as dieting, this included taking up exercise.

Ready for my close-up: She said that the raw and intimate images she took of herself helped her to cope with the difficult emotions which came with being overweight

As she began to slim down Miss Davis said she started to feel a sense of liberation.

'Things like 
sitting on a bench, or being on an airplane - all of the former worry was 
removed,' she said. 'I had a totally different sense of power.'

Now two years on she says she can hardly believe 'I was that large' when she looks back at old pictures showing her 269-pound frame.

Caught in action: Many images show her doing mundane tasks such as putting out laundry

Moment of reflection: The fine arts student said the prospect of turning 40 and still struggling with her weight was horrifying and she was desperate to make changes in her life

She first began to photograph herself as an undergraduate student at Columbia College in Chicago and continued while earning her Masters of Fine Arts at Yale University.

The images, she said, helped her to cope with insecurities and the other emotions which came with being plus-sized.

Her first shot, taken in 2002 and titled Pressure Point, shows her on a beach with friends during spring break.

Setting up the shot: To capture the images Miss Davis uses a 20foot cable with a button at the end which activates the camera shutter when pressed

Healthier habits: In a bid to fight the bulge Miss Davis changed what she ate

Tracking her progress: This shot shows Miss Davis looking considerably slimmer having a quick bite at home

She sits fully-clothed on the beach, rosy-cheeked and unsmiling, surrounded by friends in bathing suits.

Later photographs in the collection show Miss Davis posing while brushing
her hair, standing in lingerie, curled up alone in bed and sitting on a couch.

The 
last photographs in the series were taken after she lost weight.

Looking good: As the pounds slipped away Miss Davis said that her confidence grew

Look at my wobbly bits: Miss Davis says that she has been surprised by the positive response her images have attracted, with many appreciating her honesty

Not an easy journey: She says that much support comes from people 'who understand my voice, from people who have struggled with weight or body image'

To capture the images she uses a 20foot cable with a button at the end which activates the camera shutter when pressed.

Since her images have appeared online Miss Davis says she has been 'shocked' by the positive response they have garnered.

She told the Huffington Post: 'I’ve received great 
support from people who understand my voice, from people who have 
struggled with weight or body image.

The look of love: With a new-found body confidence Miss Davis became less insular and started dating - here she is pictured with her boyfriend Aldo

Liberated: She says now there are 'more opportunities, more possibilities'

'It’s great to have 
people be honest with me like I am honest with my camera.'

Now, with a newfound body confidence Miss Davis says she is enjoying being less insular. She also has a boyfriend named Aldo.

As a result she feels less inclined to whip out her camera at every moment.

'I don’t want to be photographing this anymore. I want to be 
living this!' she told The Telegraph, adding: ‘I feel like there are more opportunities, more 
possibilities. I feel like, I deserve this, too.'
