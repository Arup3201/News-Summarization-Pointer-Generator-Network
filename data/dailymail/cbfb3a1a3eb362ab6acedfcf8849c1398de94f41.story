A policewoman was 'bullied and victimised' by male bosses who cancelled the leave she had booked for her wedding after labelling her a 'trouble-maker', a tribunal was told.

Shocked Police Constable Rachel Garrett, 47, only found out that her line manager had ordered the cancellation when her now husband, a police sergeant, checked her leave dates on the Thames Valley Police system while she was signed off work sick.

PC Garrett is suing the force for sexual and disability discrimination after she accused her bosses of turning against her because of previous complaints she filed against senior colleagues.

'Victimised': PC Rachel Garrett claims her bosses at Thames Valley Police cancelled leave she had booked for her upcoming wedding without informing her

The newlywed - who suffers from asthma and carpal tunnel syndrome along with a depressive condition - also claims she was taken off some of her Olympic duties, ordered to perform a role she was not trained to do, and was 'over-scrutinised' by Inspector Roy Atwell and Superintendent Gez Chiarello.

In 2007 PC Garrett was awarded £2,000 as compensation for injury to feelings, after she took the force to an employment tribunal on similar discrimination accusations relating to the provision of body armour to female officers, and the allocation of on-call duties.

A year later the officer, who has worked for Thames Valley Police since 1985, was elected as a Police Federation representative and tasked with helping other officers - particularly in disputes with their bosses.

But in 2011 she was told that her ability to represent her colleagues had been affected by her own employment tribunal claim, leading her to lodge a second complaint in which she named Supt. Chiarello.

'He commented to me that because of my previous employment tribunal claim he didn’t know if I was "whiter than white",' she said in a statement given to the Reading Tribunal Centre in Berkshire, as part of her third and most recent hearing.

That claim went to a judicial mediation process and she was again awarded compensation for injury to feelings, this time for £1,500 pounds.

PC Garrett has claimed that since her second complaint she was 'bullied' by Supt. Chiarello, who then turned her line manager Insp. Atwell against her.

Her role with the Federation was downgraded to a three day a week post and she was told to also work as an Enquiry Officer, working on road traffic collisions while other representatives were retained full-time.

PC Garrett said that she had come up with a list of different posts she could take on as she wanted a 'fresh start', but was returned to work with the criminal justice department.

She had been an Enquiry Officer before working with the Federation, but claimed she felt undertrained to take on the role due to changes in the way the job was done - including carrying out interviews on DVDs instead of tapes.

The 47-year-old was moved from the police headquarters in Kidlington, Oxfordshire, to Witney Police Station, closer to her home in Ducklington.

But PC Garrett said she found her new office dirty and unkempt, and her colleagues unwelcoming.

'I felt under pressure to start the Enquiry Officer role without any training and before arrangements had been put in place to allow me to perform the role from Witney Police Station, as agreed,' she said in her statement.

PC Garrett said that Insp. Atwell had wanted her to start her new role without being trained, or even being able to access the computer systems, while she was still trying to balance her work as a representative 'looking after damaged and needy officers' - which she still considered a full-time post.

She said that he then ordered that a duties manager gain access to her Outlook Calendar and she felt he had become 'distrustful and wary' of her, as well as being 'over scrutinising'.The officer also discovered that Insp. Atwell was copying their email correspondence to Supt. Chiarello, leading her to feel 'micro-managed by Insp. Atwell and bullied by Supt. Chiarello'.'I believe that Insp. Atwell had been directed in his actions by Supt. Chiarello and that Supt. Chiarello was victimising me as a direct result of my previous employment tribunal complaint against the force, and him,' she said.

'I believe from the treatment I have received and the conversations I have had with Insp. Atwell that he and Supt. Chiarello had formed the view that I was a "trouble maker" and needed to be more closely managed than other officers.

'I believe that Supt. Chiarello had wrongly formed the view that I was deliberately not starting the Enquiry Officer role, which had been agreed at the judicial mediation and that he directed Insp. Atwell to supervise me closely as a result.'Pc Garrett, who also suffers from asthma and carpel tunnel syndrome as well as having a 'depressive condition', was signed off with work-related stress in November 2011.

While she was off work, she claimed that Insp. Atwell had ordered her previously approved leave - including time off for her wedding in March of this year, and subsequent honeymoon, to be cancelled.

Her partner Nick Garrett was able to re-apply for her leave, which was granted with just weeks to spare until their big day.

She refuted an argument from the force that her leave was cancelled because she had not applied for it properly, through Insp. Atwell.

PC Garrett has since returned to work, but an occupational health therapist has recommended that she remain on non-confrontational duties until after the tribunal, meaning that she has not yet returned to her Enquiry Officer post.

The tribunal, in front of a panel chaired by judge Richard Barrowclough, continues.
