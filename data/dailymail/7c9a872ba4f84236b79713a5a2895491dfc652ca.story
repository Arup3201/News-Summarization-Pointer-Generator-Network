A devoted mother of seven succumbed to blood poisoning after refusing to go to hospital because it meant she would be away from her children.

Despite doctors' best efforts, Lisa Watling, 29, died of septicaemia leading to organ failure five weeks after she was diagnosed with a minor skin infection

Her devastated husband Andy Greaves, 32, and her parents, Pauline and Albo Hilton, say Ms Watling’s six sons and one daughter will be her legacy.

'She was a mum before anything else': Lisa Watling and her husband Andy Greaves on a night out together. Ms Watling died of septicaemia after refusing to go to hospital because she didn't want to leave her children

Six sons and a daughter: Paisleigh, Jaidon, Ainsley, Lewis, Mason, Kieran and Amelia at the family home in Hull

'She was a mum before anything else,' said Mr Greaves.

'I see her in every one of our children. It breaks my heart, not just that she is going to miss out on so much of them but how they are going to miss out on her, too.'

Ms Watling, from Hull, Yorkshire, had been ill with cellulitis for only five weeks before she slipped away. She had been prescribed antibiotics for the infection, but did not take the drugs properly.

As the infection took hold, Mr Greaves begged his wife to go to the hospital but, because she hated being away from the children for too long, she refused to be admitted.

Eventually, she became so ill, she started became delirious and her mother called an ambulance.

Paramedics rushed her to Hull Royal Infirmary, where doctors told the family there was a strong chance Ms Watling could lose her leg.

Medics put her in an induced coma and she was wheeled to theatre for the amputation, but by then the poison had already spread too far and her vital organs began to fail.

With no way to save her, doctors took her off the dialysis machine which was keeping her alive and she passed away with her husband and her parents by her side.

'She loved having children': Mr Greaves and Ms Watling with Kieran, Lewis, Jaidon and Mason. Doctors tried to save her life by amputating her leg, but the poison had already spread too far and her organs failed

Mr Greaves, who was married to Ms Watling for 11 years, said: 'I was looking at her in that hospital bed, trying to take in every bit of her I could.

'When they told us she wasn’t going to make it, she seemed to get a bit better, just enough for us to cling on to a little bit of hope and I could see us coming home together.

'Now, every time I close my eyes, I see her in the hospital bed. It didn’t seem like her.'

Mr Hilton, 58, said: 'All she wanted was to be at home with the children. All she thought about was them. Now they are her legacy and our strength.'

Mrs Hilton, 49, added: 'When they turned the machine off, I couldn’t watch my firstborn die.

'Lisa was a fantastic person and mother.

'She loved having children, she was a natural at it. She was so proud of them all.'

'She was my firstborn and my best friend': Mother Lisa Hilton, front, with Ms Watling, left, and sisters Becki Watling, rear, and Danielle Hilton, right. Mrs Hilton said that her daughter was 'born to be a mum'

Ms Watling was well known and loved by many friends in the Hessle Road area of Hull whom she had known growing up and through playing darts at the Halfway House pub.

'She could make friends in an empty room,' said Mr Greaves. 'We couldn’t walk ten paces down the road without being stopped by someone for a chat.

'There were no airs and graces with her. She knew everyone and everybody loved her.

'It was her big heart that went in the end. She gave us all her love.'

'I cannot describe how I feel without her. I am broken': Lisa and Andrew on their wedding day 11 years ago

Mr Hilton added: 'She had an impact on everyone she met. Even if they didn’t know her, she would make them laugh. They couldn’t help but fall in love with her.

'I cannot describe how I feel without her. I am broken.'

Mrs Hilton said it was heartbreaking that her daughter, who was 'born to be a mum' would never be able to see her seven children grow up.

'She was my firstborn and my best friend,' she said. 'Her kids are our strength now, they are helping us through and we have to be strong for them and Andy.'

Ms Watling died on Monday, April 14, leaving Kieran, 11, Lewis, nine, Mason, six, Jaidon, five, Paisleigh, three and Ainsley, 14 months.
