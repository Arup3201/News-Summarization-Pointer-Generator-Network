Jordan McDonald, 23, has been jailed for eight years for stealing £23,000 from a 26-year-old

A thug who robbed a businessman was caught after leaving his bus pass in the abandoned getaway car and storing pictures of £5,000 in stolen cash on his phone.

Jordan McDonald, 23, has been jailed for eight years for stealing £23,000 from a 26-year-old after spotting him withdrawing staff wages from a Birmingham bank in July 2013.

He was part of a four-strong gang that pulled up alongside the businessman in a stolen Toyota Corolla in Handsworth Wood before taking out a metal bar  and demanding the cash.

The gang abandoned the getaway vehicle in nearby Winson Green, but McDonald was easily traced by police after he left a travel pass and a shopping voucher in the back seat- which both had his name on.

When officers searched his home they seized his phone and found images showing bundles of £50 notes neatly laid on a stairway at his girlfriend's house.

McDonald, from Aston, Birmingham was arrested after a search of his partner's property uncovered £5,800 of the stolen money.

He even tried to pass of the cash - which equated to about a quarter of the spoils shared between the offenders - as money received from the sale of a car.

The 23-year-old denied the offence and stood trial last month at Birmingham Crown Court where he was sentenced to eight years in jail earlier this week.

Detective Constable Michelle Hunt, from West Midlands Police, said: 'McDonald was foolish to think that the jury would believe his web of lies with the amount of evidence against him.

'He will now have several years behind bars to contemplate the error of his ways.'

McDonald's accomplices have not been traced and police are still appealing for any information that might assist in their arrest.
