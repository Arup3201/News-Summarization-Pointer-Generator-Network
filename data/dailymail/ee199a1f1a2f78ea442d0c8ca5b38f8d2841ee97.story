Tough love: Ohio businessman Ron Kronenberger was charged with assault after allegedly whipping his tenant. He is now accused of attacking a second man

An Ohio landlord accused of whipping a tenant with a belt on his bare buttocks for falling behind on his rent - is alleged to have beat another man with a belt and a paddle.

When Ron Kronenberger's tenant failed to come
up with $2,800 in back rent, the Ohio businessman allegedly did what 
many landlords can only dream of: he took off his belt and gave the 
29-year-old a whipping.

He is now accused of beating a second man - who is believed to be mentally disabled - with a belt and a paddle at his office at a supermarket.

This time the accusations came in a lawsuit filed this week in Warren County, according to the Dayton Daily News.

Kronenberger is alleged to have attacked the first man in his office on January 22. Police in the village of Waynesville said the 53-year-old was charged with one count of misdemeanor assault stemming from the bizarre altercation in the back office of his supermarket.

According to officials, angered that the tenant had failed to come up with the considerable rent payment, Kronenberger told him that if he was going to act like a child, he would treat him like one.

He then allegedly hit him four times with a belt, leaving 'small marks’ on his rear. Police say the tenant later told them he was scared and just wanted to get it over with, so he complied with Kronenberger’s demand to bend over, placing his hands on a chair.

An arrest report states that when confronted by Police Chief Gary Copeland, Kronenberger admitted to whipping his tenant.

'Spanking scene': Police say the 29-year-old victim came into Kronenberger's back office inside Hometown Market, where the business owner told him to bend over

The Dayton Daily News reported that Kronenberger, who owns Hometown Market in town, is a former chamber of commerce president who was voted in 2006 as Waynesville's Citizen of the Year.

Residents in the small community of 2,800 were shocked by the arrest of the prominent local businessman, but some told ABC22 that they can understand his frustration with the insolvent tenant.

A magistrate said he would dismiss 
the assault charge in six months if Kronenberger has no contact with the
tenant and stays out of trouble.

Police say they have no record of the second incident. Kronenberger and his lawyer declined to comment.
