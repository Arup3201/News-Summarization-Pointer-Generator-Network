An MP’s stepson was found guilty yesterday of the murder of a colleague whose body has never been found.

David Gilroy killed Suzanne Pilley in the basement of their workplace after she told him their affair was over.

The married father of two is thought to have buried her body in a forest but police have not been able to find the precise location.

Guilty! David Gilroy, 49, (left) was convicted of killing Suzanne Pilley, 38, (right) by 'unknown means' after prosecutors convinced a jury he had buried the book-keeper's body in a 'lonely grave' in the Scottish wilds

His father Bernard’s second marriage was to Linda Gilroy, Labour MP for Plymouth and Sutton from 1997 to 2010.

The 49-year-old became the prime 
suspect when officers learned of his relationship  with 38-year-old Miss
Pilley.

Her mother told the court of their turbulent relationship and 
how her daughter soon tired of his lies and jealous behaviour.

Adventurer: Miss Pilley was described as a proud Scot who led a full and active life, and enjoyed the great outdoors, always walking, cycling and keeping fit

Routine day: She boarded the buses she normally took from her Whitson Road flat to her work at Infrastructure Managers Limited in Edinburgh's Thistle Street, where she had worked for about two years

The day before Miss Pilley vanished, 
she spent the night with a man she had met online, 41-year-old planning 
officer Mark Brooks.

Police believe this caused Gilroy, an operations 
manager, to snap.

They discovered that in the weeks 
leading up to her disappearance, Gilroy pestered Miss Pilley with more 
than 400 text messages.

Missing: Prosecutors said he killed Ms Pilley on the day she vanished in the basement of the Thistle Street building where they both worked

Sinister: Prosecutors said he placed her body in the recess of the building, got his car from home, brought it to the garage, placed her dead body in the boot, took her home and next day

Search: Gilroy¿s Vauxhall Vectra was spotted on CCTV travelling between Edinburgh and Lochgilphead, Argyll, the day after Ms Pilley disappeared

Mystery: A massive search for Ms Pilley's body was undertaken in the Argyle Forest Park north of Arrochar, west Scotland but no body was found

Challenge: He disappearance sparked a high-profile missing person inquiry and one of the most challenging investigations carried out by Lothian and Borders Police

As soon as the bookkeeper went missing, those 
messages stopped.

He had also tampered with her email account and sent her emails in another man’s name from a bogus account.

Miss Pilley’s parents, Sylvia  and 
Rob, both 67, were in  Edinburgh’s High Court to see  Gilroy, of 
Edinburgh, convicted of murder and a second charge of attempting to 
defeat the ends of justice by frustrating the police investigation.

They say they are unable to grieve properly because their daughter’s body has not been found.

The case is one of just a handful in which a murderer has been convicted in the absence of a body.

Suspicion: Gilroy had scratches on his body around the time Ms Pilley vanished, which could have been caused by fingernails during a struggle, the court was told

Loved: Suzanne Pilley was described by colleagues as 'a much-loved friend and colleague

Miss Pilley vanished on May 4, 2010, 
during what should have been a routine journey to work at Infrastructure
Managers Limited in Edinburgh.

Police found her passport when they visited her home. None of her bank accounts or credit cards have been touched.

Prosecutor Alex Prentice said: ‘The 
Crown case is that Suzanne Pilley met David Gilroy on that morning; that
they went to the basement in the building together, quite possibly with
the consent of both, and that he killed her.

‘He got his car from home, brought it 
to the garage, placed her dead body in the boot, took her home  and next
day transported her to a lonely grave somewhere in Argyll, where she is
now.’

Although no forensic evidence was 
recovered, a police dog showed interest in the boot of Gilroy’s Vauxhall
Vectra, which was said to have had a smell of cleaning fluid or air 
freshener.

He had scratches on his body around 
the time Miss Pilley vanished and his car was spotted on CCTV travelling
to Lochgilphead, Argyll, the day after she disappeared.

Outside court, Gilroy’s wife Andrea, who is a nurse, vowed to stand by him, insisting he was innocent.

Sentencing was adjourned until April 18 for reports.

Clues: A police dog searching his home showed interest in the boot of Gilroy¿s silver car, which was said to have had a smell of cleaning fluid or air freshener

Anguish: Ms Pilley’s parents, Sylvia and Robert, said they hoped one day to lay their daughter to rest
