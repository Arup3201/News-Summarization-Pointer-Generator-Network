Lucy the beagle is a very naughty dog. But also a very smart one.

While her owner, Rodd Scheinerman, was out of the house, the dog was caught on camera strategically getting ready-to-eat chicken nuggets out of the hot micro-oven sitting on the kitchen counter.

The video captures the beagle at first moving restlessly around the kitchen floor as she smells the food being cooked.

Too far to jump: Lucy the beagle was caught on camera stealing chicken nuggets from the oven, which is seen in the far corner on the kitchen counter

She tries to jump up onto the counter but just can’t reach.

Lucy then moves around the dining table until a brilliant plan pops into her mind  - the chair!

She strategically pushes the chair from underneath the table with her paw so it is close enough to the kitchen counter so that she can jump up.

She balances slowly along the counter past the sink and opens the oven door with her paw. The oven is too hot inside to stick her nose in, so she uses her paw again to pull out the tray of chicken nuggets.

They land on the floor and, hey presto, dinner is served!   

The video has been seen by almost 300,000 viewers on YouTube.

Can't reach: The beagle is seen trying to scramble up the from the side of the counter but to no avail

...there must be a way: The dog circles the kitchen table looking for a way to get those nuggets

One paw at a time: The dog pushes the chair out from underneath the table and gets it close enough to the counter

She jumps up on the chair but realises she is standing in a difficult angle

Try again: She jumps down and gets in the right position

She's up! The dog leaps from the floor to the counter top in two neat jumps

Open sesame: She expertly paws the oven door open

Come to mama: Then she pulls out the tray on which the deliciously-smelling chicken nuggets await her salivating mouth

On the floor: The goodies and tray land on the floor with a big crash

Dinner is served: Lucy devours the nuggets in seconds
