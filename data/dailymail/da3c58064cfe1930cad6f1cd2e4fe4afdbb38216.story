Veteran actor Roger Moore has blamed a French magazine for embroiling him in a racism row after it reported his comments that Idris Elba cannot play James Bond because he was not 'English-English' enough. 

Sir Roger made the comments in an interview with French magazine Paris Match, although the former Bond star claimed his words had been 'lost in translation'. 

The actor, who left Britain in 1978 and splits his time between Switzerland and Monaco said: 'An interview I gave to Paris Match implies I said something racist about Idris Elba. That is simply untrue.'

Following the revelations, Sir Roger has faced strong criticism on Twitter over the suggestions. Sir Roger made the 'English-English' comments, even though former Bonds Sean Connery, Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan were Scottish, Welsh and Irish.

The 87-year-old actor, who is an ambassador for Unicef, starred in seven Bond movies between 1973 and 1985.

Sir Roger told Paris Match: 'A few years ago, I said that [black actor] Cuba Gooding Jnr would make an excellent Bond, but it was a joke!' replies Sir Roger, 87, who starred in seven Bond movies between 1973 and 1985.

'Although James may have been played by a Scot, a Welshman and an Irishman, I think he should be "English-English",' he continues.

'Nevertheless, it's an interesting idea, but unrealistic.'

Reaction on social media has been overwhelmingly negative with Twitter users accusing Sir Roger of 'racism'. 

Many commentators highlighted the fact that Elba was born and raised in the East End of London.

One user said Roger Moore 'is a bit racist' over his controversial comments,  

Elba is seen as the leading contender to play Bond once Daniel Craig holsters his Walther PPK for the last time. 

Bookmaker Paddy Power has Elba as the 7/4 favourite to be granted his Licence to Kill. 

Leaked Sony emails suggested that Elba was being considered for the role, while current Bond Daniel Craig as also said the Hackney-born actor is the only possible choice to replace him.
