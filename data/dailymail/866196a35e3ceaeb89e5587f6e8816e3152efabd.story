Tablet computers, smart phones and flatscreen TVs may feature high on Christmas wish lists this year – but they won’t necessarily stand the test of time.

For research has shown that the bedside digital alarm clock is the gadget we are most likely to hang on to for the longest.

With its brightly glowing numbers and basic push-button functions, it is hardly the most high-tech gadget in our homes.

Top ten gizmos

Classic: Other seemingly obsolete items that have stood the test of time are the toasted sandwich maker, left, and the calculator, right, according to the research

But it is the one we are most reluctant to part with.

The top ten longest-lasting gadgets still in use also includes toasted sandwich makers, calculators and electric carving knives.

And even in this digital age, there are still millions of homes who have
kept and still regularly use their old video cassette recorders and 
record players.

Must have: Many people surveyed said that they simply cannot live without their favourite games console

Although many of us are reluctant to part with our old devices, they are
not the most loved gizmos we own, according to a poll for the Gadget 
Show Live Christmas event.

Smartphones and broadband were named as the things that modern Britons say they cannot live without.

Gadget Show Live Christmas, which takes place in London from November 30
to December 2, surveyed 1,000 consumers about their favourite 
technology.

Asked about the gadgets that had been in their home the longest, the 
digital alarm clock, toasted sandwich makers and pocket calculators came
out on top. They were followed by the original Nintendo Game Boy, 
electric carving knives, pop-up toasters and bread makers.

And in a nod to times gone by, the list is completed by the digital watch, VCR and record player.

Asked about the gadgets they can’t live without, the smartphone and broadband is followed by the colour television, laptop, tablet computer and games console.

But one company came out a clear winner when it came to the gadgets that are most loved by  the nation.

High tech: The iPhone 5 has already become the nation's favourite all time gadget according to those surveyed by Gadget Show Live Christmas

Top ten: The laptop is near the top of the list of items that Britons could not live without

Favourite: The TV was number three on the list of gadgets that people cannot live without

Apple won the accolade for the favourite gadget of all time with its iPhone 5, followed by the iPad in second place. The iPod was in fifth place behind the TV and personal computer.

Among celebrities, the choice varied too.

Comedian Marcus Brigstocke named the television as his  favourite gadget of all time and Autumnwatch presenter Chris Packham named a Spypoint  HD-10 camera.

Gadget Show presenter Pollyanna Woodward said: ‘Too often we think of “gadgets” as being faddish and temporary, yet this list proves that the very best gadgets stand the test of time.

‘It will be interesting to see how many of today’s essential must- have gadgets will be with us in 20 or 30 years time.’
