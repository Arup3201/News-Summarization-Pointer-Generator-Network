They have become synonymous with middle-class chique, with the likes of David Cameron and Carole and Michael Middleton said to be fans of the 'kitchen supper'.

And now it seems the kitchen is replacing the lounge as the room of choice for families to spend time in up and down the country.

The craze for the giant kitchen - or 'multifunctional living space' - complete with widescreen TV, DVD box sets and sofa, is becoming ever more popular, according to a report in The Times.

Super-size: Families are now gathering in extra large kitchens known as 'multifunctional living spaces'

Kitchens are now being extended outwards and even downwards to create what was once called a kitchen-dinning room.

Often these extra large kitchens, also known as 'family rooms' are accompanied with sliding glass doors that lead to an outside area, such as a patio.

Copper pans either hang from overhead racks or line brightly coloured walls coated with the highest quality paint.

The all-important island remains central to the overall effect. In some London homes, there are now two islands, one for the hob and another for the sink.

Trend: Often sliding glass doors will lead from the super-size kitchen to outside areas such as patios

Food for thought: TV show The OC has been credited with sparking an increase in demand for larger kitchens

Normally makeover shows are credited with sparking the latest fashions in interior design, but US TV series The OC has played its part this time, for it is around the island of the super-size kitchen that the majority of the dramatic scenes were filmed.

Th Brothers and Sisters drama has also influenced the trend.

But while the days of families gathering in the living room may be over, for now at least, in the deluxe sector the separate dining room is said to be making a comeback.
