Liverpool are showing an interest in Club Brugge goalkeeper Mathew Ryan. 

The 22-year-old Australia international has been outstanding in the Belgian league this season and excelled in the recent Europa League tie with Torino.

Although only small for a goalkeeper, at barely 6ft, Ryan has a good leap and figured for Australia at the World Cup.

Liverpool are in the market for a keeper this month as they look to increase competition for Simon Mignolet.

Crystal Palace have made an enquiry to sign Liverpool left-back Jose Enrique on loan while West Bromwich Albion remain keen on Rickie Lambert although Liverpool would want £4m and are reluctant to loan out the England international.
