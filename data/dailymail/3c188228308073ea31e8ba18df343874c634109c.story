West Ham United midfielder Diego Poyet is wanted on loan by Championship side Watford.

The 19-year-old has made four appearances since his summer move from Charlton and came on as a substitute for Matt Jarvis in Tuesday night's FA Cup draw with Everton at Goodison Park.

He had a loan spell with Huddersfield earlier in the season and they are interested too.

Watford, however, are fifth in the Championship, seven points off leaders Bournemouth, and believe a couple of shrewd acquisitions this month could give them the extra edge required to challenge for promotion.

West Ham are open to the loan as they want Poyet to keep developing and he needs competitive games for that to happen.

Watford, meanwhile, are giving a trial to Vujadin Savic. The Serbian centre back played just over an hour in a back three for Watford Under 21s against Leeds United this week.

They scored five first-half goals in a 6-1 victory in the Premier League Under 21 Cup.

The 24-year-old Savic has previously played for Bordeaux and was on loan at Dynamo Dresden and Arminia Bielefeld.
