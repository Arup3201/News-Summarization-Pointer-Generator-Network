Amid all the thunder in Cardiff on Friday night, England believe they can unleash a lightning bolt. Jonathan Joseph has been recalled to electrify the visitors’ attack in midfield.

The Bath centre will provide Stuart Lancaster’s side with something different, of that there can be no doubt. 

Alongside him, Luther Burrell of Northampton will attempt to take on the Wales centres Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies at their own game of power-running and off-loading, but Joseph is the X-factor addition.

Friday will see England’s 11th centre combination since Stuart Lancaster took over the reins as head coach. 

Lancaster’s favourite pair is Manu Tuilagi and Brad Barritt, who is the most frequently selected centre (19).

His selection for a first Test appearance since June 2013 is reward for consistently outstanding club performances this season. 

Last month, the 23-year-old demonstrated his match-winning credentials with a masterclass in Toulouse capped by a stunning act of sorcery to conjure a bonus-point try for his team.

The slaloming break which followed a clever little kick into space was a vivid example of his ability to shred defences and it helped to propel him into England’s starting XV, confirmed on Thursday for their RBS 6 Nations opener at the Millennium Stadium.

Lancaster will hope Joseph offers an alternative to the route-one approach. Roberts, Davies and Burrell will set out to batter the defensive ramparts, while the man in the white No 13 shirt will seek to circumvent them.

George Ford, the man charged with igniting the English attack from fly-half, knows all about the qualities offered by his back-in-favour Bath colleague and he offered an emphatic endorsement.

‘He’s been brilliant, especially this year with his communication,’ said Ford. ‘In attack, he has been world-class and his defence has been brilliant as well; he leads that at the club.

Five things to know about England centre Joseph

'JJ always has that ability to create something out of nothing with an outside break or he off-loads with one hand — and like you saw against Toulouse, his little kick through to create that try.

‘There aren’t many players who can create things like that. He offers something different with his speed, his agility and his outside break. It is our job to get him into the right positions to do that.

‘He always wants the ball in his hands in attack, but he is also good at things people don’t see, like his kick-chase and his communication about when to kick and so on. 

'To get the opportunity to play with him on Friday is exciting.’

Ford played down the significance of Joseph’s tour de force in Toulouse, on the basis that he has been hitting such heights all season. 

‘He was brilliant that day,’ said Ford, ‘but he has been playing like that all year. The try he created sticks out but he’s been making line-breaks all year. 

'He has been defensively solid and making good hits all year, too. He has definitely earned his start on Friday.’

Joseph was reluctant to bang his own drum, but admitted that the performance in Toulouse ‘probably helped’ his claims for a Test return. 

He has been more satisfied with his improvements in less eye-catching aspects of the game. Defence has been one such area of development and communication another.

‘You just have to be loud. It is an area of my game that has got a load better. I think it does help the fly-halves if you have another voice outside them telling the right options and where the space is. I think that’s worked very well with me and George at Bath.’

In an interview with Sportsmail last month, the former London Irish player said he would always stay true to his instincts to seek space rather than try to be something he is not, a crash-ball carrier aiming to force his way over the gainline.

Now that he is back in the England team he is optimistic that he will be given the licence to cut loose when the chance arises.

Asked if the coaches will allow him to play to his strengths, he said: ‘I think they’ll have to...it’s a game of rugby and if the right decision is to run, we’ll run.

‘We have to be smart and do it in the right areas, but there’s no reason with turn-over ball, if there is the opportunity, that we can’t run the ball. It’ll be great if we can really attack it and take it to them.’

As a player who grew up idolising the likes of Brian O’Driscoll and Jason Robinson, there was never any doubt that Joseph would emerge as a free spirit and that attitude was apparent in his hopes for this high-stakes game.

‘We have a mind-set to play,’ he said. ‘If we have a chance to play and it is on, we’ll play. We don’t want to waste opportunities. We are playing for a reason — we want to be challenging defences.’

England head coach Lancaster echoed Ford in extolling Joseph’s virtues as a back-line co-ordinator who can take some of the load off the primary playmaker. 

Lancaster has picked him as the form option at No 13 — in the absence of the injured Manu Tuilagi — and must hope that Burrell can return to the peaks of his early-season displays, before a mini-dip last month.

Elsewhere, the case for the return of Tom Youngs, Nick Easter and Tom Croft among the replacements was made on the basis of their collective experience, which will be so vital amid the maelstrom of a Test in Cardiff.

The same could be said for James Haskell, who is back in the starting back row at blindside flanker. England are much changed, but scarcely weakened.
