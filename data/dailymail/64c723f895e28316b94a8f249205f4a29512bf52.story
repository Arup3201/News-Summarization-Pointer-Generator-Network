The two window washers that were trapped on the side of One World Trade Center on Wednesday when a cable on their scaffold came loose talked about the terrifying incident during a press conference. 

Juan Lizama ,41, and Juan Lopez, said they were prepared and ready to deal with what happened thanks to their training, and said they were always in control of the situation.

That being said, the two were also thankful nothing happened to them.

Family man: Lizama (above) who called his wife while trapped, revealed she was also the first person he called after the men were rescued

'I’m just happy to be alive. I’m happy to have made it home to see my family for another day,' said Lopez.

Lopez also admitted that he did panic while being trapped, and is now considering a move to a more ground level profession.

Lizama meanwhile took time to thank the members of the Fire Department of New York who saved the two, before the El Salvador native added, 'God bless America.'

He also called Lopez the 'best partner possible.'

Thankful: Both men praised the members of FDNY who helped get them to safety

Officials still have yet to determine what caused the cable problem that resulted in the men hanging almost vertically against the building for 90 minutes on Wednesday.

Both managed to get to safety without suffering any injuries, though they were rushed to Bellevue Hospital where they were treated for mild hypothermia. 

Lizama, who spoke with his wife on his cell phone while the two were trapped, says she was the first person he called to let her know he was safe.
