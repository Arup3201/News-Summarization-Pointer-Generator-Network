An unemployed family claim documentary makers made them look like 'racist morons' after they appeared on controversial TV show ‘Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole’.

Gordon Higinbotham - who has a foot long tattoo of Adolf Hitler on his back - and his daughter and son-in-law, Roseanne and Mark Snowden, claim they are now too scared to leave their home after receiving death threats following the Channel 5 programme.

More than 2.5 million people tuned into the hour-long show which followed three families claiming benefits in Hull, East Yorkshire.

During the programme on Monday Mr Higinbotham's 15 tattoos were on display - including a ‘White Power’ slogan, the foot-long image of Adolf Hitler, which dominates his back, and an intricate picture of the Ku Klux Klan, which runs across the length of his stomach.

Gordon Higinbotham - who has a foot long tattoo of Adolf Hitler on his back - claims documentary makers made him look like a 'racist moron' after he appeared on controversial TV show 'Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole'

Mr Higinbotham  and his daughter and son-in-law, Roseanne and Mark Snowden (pictured), claim they are now too scared to leave their home after receiving death threats following the Channel 5 programme

During the programme, father-of-four Mr Higinbotham said he had never had had a full-time job due to having a disabled son, and a lack of help by the Government.

But he drew criticism from many members of the public, after he offered to pay daugher and son in law money to vote UKIP in the EU elections. 

He was filmed saying, ‘You tell me you’ve voted UKIP and I’ll give you some money’, before walking around Hull’s largest council estate in a jacket with ‘Skinheads Forever’ across the back. 

He claims he was portrayed as racist in the footage, after being filmed saying: 'I like anyone as long as they’re English'.

The family have since issued an apology to the entire city of Hull in a bid to stave off trouble after fearing reprisals for their appearance. 

Mr Higinbotham's strong political views angered many members of the public, after he offered to pay his daugher and son-in-law money to vote UKIP in the EU elections

He was filmed saying: 'You tell me you've voted UKIP and I'll give you some money', before walking around Hull's largest council estate in a jacket with 'Skinheads Forever' across the back

He said: 'I can’t even leave the house without people telling me they want to kill me. 

'We have been completely screwed over by Channel 5.

'I only went on the show to stick up for poor people and they have twisted what we said to make us look like morons.'

'I like everybody,' he said. 'I have got Indian friends and I know people from all over the world. I like all these people.

'I went through a really bad patch when my dad and my brother’s girlfriend died, and I turned to drink. I got in a fight with some foreign people and I was in a bad place so I had the tattoos done. 

'I really regret them now, and I want to get them removed.'

When the programme-makers announced in March that filming had begun, politicians expressed fears it would show Hull in a bad light.

Mr Higinbotham said: 'I wish I had listened to the advice now.

'I am getting so much abuse from people in the street, calling me a fat so-and-so and a fat Hitler.

'I am no racist and I am definitely not fat. The programme made me look so podgy, I watched in horror.'

Roseanne Snowden, who is now four months pregnant with her first child, is married to husband Mark, and receives £114-a-week as well as a flat funded by the state

The family agreed to take part after they received a flyer asking people on benefits to contribute to the documentary. Roseanne Snowden, who is now four months pregnant with her first child, is married to husband Mark, and receives £114-a-week as well as a flat funded by the state. 

They have both been job hunting for years, but say they are unable to find any work, so took part in the Channel 5 show to try and secure full time employment.

She said: 'Mark has been unemployed for three years and he was doing a job search on a computer in the job centre.

'There was some leaflets next to him, which asked if you wanted to get into full time work.

'We thought it was an opportunity for him to find a job, and they were really nice and professional. 

'But they have humiliated us, we are devastated.'

The family have apologised for the way the programme made Hull look, but say they were completely set-up by Channel 5.

Mrs Snowden, 23, said: 'They filmed me in interviews for college, both Mark and I applying for 25 jobs each, but did you see any of that?

'Mark got teaching qualifications while they were filming, but they didn’t put any of it in.

On the show, Mr Higinbotham's 15 tattoos were also shown - including a 'White Power' slogan, a foot-long image of Adolf Hitler, which dominates his back, and an intricate picture of the Ku Klux Klan, which runs across the length of his stomach

'We’re so sorry but we feel really stupid. The only reason we wanted to do it was to get enough publicity to get full time work.

'They made us look really bad, and we have been really badly abused for being on the show.'

Mr Higinbotham, whose son suffers from curvature of the spine, is paid £200 a week in benefits.

He said: 'They said that I haven’t worked in decades but they didn’t explain the reasons why. ''They have ruined my life. People are now telling me I should be killed. '

They have since contacted Channel 5 to raise their concerns over the programme, but their complaints have fallen on deaf ears. 

Mr Snowden, a 29-year-old history graduate, said: 'We rang them up to ask them why they edited it to make us look so bad but they don’t care. 

'They even offered us a chance to take part in a follow-up, but they must be joking. 

'They have made us look like clowns in a freak show. 

'We can’t leave the house because we’re being hassled. Even little kids are knocking on the door asking for selfies.'

The family believe Channel 5 is trying to mimics Channel 4’s success with Benefits Street.

Mr Higinbotham added: 'I think because Benefits Street was so successful they think that if they do a show that’s just as bad, they’ll get loads of money. 

'They promised us everything and they haven’t done anything to help us.'

A spokesman from Channel 5 told Mail Online: 'Benefits Britain: Life on the Dole is a documentary series from Channel 5 exploring the issues and challenges created by unemployment and debt nationwide. The programme is an observational one which shows accurately the lives and feelings of various residents around the UK, including Gordon Higinbotham. 

'The programme faithfully reported his views, and fulfilled its obligation to portray Mr Higinbotham fairly throughout filming, with his story straight from his own mouth. 

'He was very positive about wanting to be in the show throughout, and keen to have his views heard. There was no interference or manipulation from the production team at any point. '
