Sky Sports have rolled out their big-name pundits on transfer deadline day, and it is a move that Gary Lineker found rather puzzling.

Among Sky's studio experts on Monday was former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, who recently moved into a career in the media having just retired from the game.

And Lineker took to Twitter to question Sky's decision to utilise Henry on transfer deadline day.

He tweeted: 'Using @ThierryHenry for Transfer Deadline Day is like using @GordonRamsay to make toast.'

Henry was in the Sky Sports news studio with Jamie Redknapp and Alan Smith in the early evening on transfer deadline day after Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville had also appeared earlier in the day.

Lineker worked with Henry during the summer of 2014 when the pair were both part of BBC's coverage of the World Cup in Brazil.

Henry called an end to his playing career after a four-year stay with the New York Red Bulls in the MLS and then joined Sky Sports.
