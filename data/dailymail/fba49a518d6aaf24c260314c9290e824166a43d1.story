They seem to come along only once every 77 years, so David Cameron was not going to miss his chance.

Fresh from roaring Andy Murray to Britain’s first men’s Wimbledon title since 1936 on Sunday, the Prime Minister yesterday pulled out all the stops  to welcome him to Downing Street.

The Prime Minister could barely contain his glee as the newly crowned champion arrived for a reception.

And, no doubt hoping some of Murray’s winning star dust might rub off on the Coalition, No 10 staff had a photo of the PM and Murray out on Twitter within seconds of their meeting.

Mr Cameron confirmed that the Wimbledon champion would be recommended for a knighthood, with Murray saying it  would be a ‘nice thing to have’.

The Prime Minister said he would put the ‘suggestion’ to the Honours Committee, adding: ‘I can’t think of anyone who deserves one more.’

Mr Cameron said Murray had ‘lifted the spirits of the whole country’ with his nerve-racking win over world No 1 Novak Djokovic.

He added: ‘It was a fantastic day for Andy Murray, for British tennis and for Britain. We were wondering yesterday morning, “Do we dare to dream that this is possible?” and he proved absolutely that it was.

‘Honours are decided independently but, frankly, I can’t think of anyone who deserves one more.’ Murray said he was not sure that he had earned the honour but indicated he would happily accept it. Asked if he would accept the gong, he said: ‘I wouldn’t turn it down.’

The 26-year-old added: ‘I think it’s a nice thing to have or be offered.

‘I think just because everyone’s waited for such a long time for this, that’s probably why it’ll be suggested, but I don’t know if it merits that. I don’t know.’

Murray was awarded an OBE in the New Year’s honours list for services to tennis after he won Olympic gold and triumphed at the US Open last October.

It is usual for public figures to wait for four years before being given a higher honour. But senior government sources said that was ‘not a hard and fast rule’ and the convention will be ignored because of the magnitude of the moment.

The suggestion that the Government will recommend the gong sparked a debate about whether someone who was paid £1.6million for his win and is still only 26 should get one of the highest honours.

Ministers appear to be following the example of Sir Bradley Wiggins who was honoured for winning the Tour de France.

Former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe said: ‘It’s a good idea. We honoured the Olympians last year and this goes down as being as significant as England winning the World Cup in 1966.

I hope Andy Murray’s win act as an inspiration for young people. His age is nothing to do with it. You honour the achievement not the age.’

But Labour MP Paul Flynn, who sits on the public administration select committee, which recently conducted an inquiry into honours, said: ‘It puzzles me why anyone would want the same award as Sir James Savile or Sir Cyril Smith.

If Andy Murray is offered one he should refuse it and turn up in the Royal Box next year wearing a badge saying, “HRH – Has Refused Honour!”’
