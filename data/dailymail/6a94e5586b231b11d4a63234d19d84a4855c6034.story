Jobs and prosperity 'for the many' are at stake due to the row over bonuses, according to George Osborne

An anti-business culture is developing in Britain, George Osborne warned last night.

The Chancellor said the growing row over fat-cat pay and bonuses was threatening the economy.

‘At stake are not pay packages for a few but jobs and prosperity for the many,’ he told a meeting of the Federation of Small Businesses last night.

Mr Osborne insisted the Government had to do more for commerce and that he was battling against a ‘relentless pressure to regulate’ within Whitehall.

In a swipe at the BBC, he said: ‘It would be so easy to give into the constant stream of vested interests demanding that you regulate a problem away – every time you are interviewed on the Today programme, or meet with the single issue lobby groups or face the trade union campaigns.

‘Everything in politics encourages more red tape – everyone insists government must step in – “something must be done” is always the cry. We have to resist these pressures.’

The Chancellor said he understood public concern about bonuses, but insisted it must not be allowed to undermine efforts to restore growth by curbing rewards for success.

‘Of course rewards for failure are unacceptable  and those who believe in the free market are the first to say so,’ he added.

‘But a strong, free market economy must be built on rewards for success. There are those who are trying to create an anti-business culture in Britain – and we have to stop them.’

His intervention in London comes days after Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive Stephen Hester waived a bonus of almost £1million in the face of intense political and public pressure.

Some corporate leaders have warned that political attacks on business could deter investors.

At the weekend Sir Martin Sorrell, head of the advertising giant WPP, said: ‘If this indiscriminate business bashing continues, the most important engines of economic growth, jobs and government tax revenues – the private sector – will be cowed and hobbled.

‘The alternatives will be to invest and go elsewhere.’ Mr Osborne indicated his support for plans to roll back some employment rights, including a proposal to allow small firms to make ‘no fault’ dismissals of staff with less than two years’ service.

Labour last night called on ministers to do more to tackle excessive bonuses, particularly in the banking sector.

Chuka Umunna, the party’s business spokesman, said even banks not bailed out by the state enjoyed an ‘implicit taxpayer guarantee’ – placing them under a duty to act responsibly.
