A convicted conman tried to hire hitmen to kill and decapitate the judge and young female prosecutor who put him in jail for 15 years, a court has heard.

Joseph Romano, 49, offered the killers a bonus if they kept the heads in formaldehyde - a toxic chemical used to preserve dead bodies -  as souvenirs, a judge was told.

Romano allegedly told an informant that he wanted to torture Judge Joseph Bianco and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Gatz before they were killed.

The informant reported the threat to the FBI, the authorities said yesterday.

FBI special agent Reynaldo Tariche said in court papers: 'Romano requested that the heads of both the judge and the [prosecutor] be preserved in formaldehyde as souvenirs.'

'Romano was willing to pay extra 
for the "souvenirs" if [the undercover] was willing to store them until 
Romano’s release from prison.'

Romano appeared emotionless at a brief court appearance in Central Islip, New York, yesterday.

The FBI also arrested Dejvid 
Mirkovic, a business associate of Romano, and charged him with acting as
the intermediary between two undercover FBI agents posing as hitmen, 
according to court papers.

Romano had pleaded guilty in 2010 to wire and bank fraud in connection with a 'boiler room scheme' in which victims were offered collectible coins at vastly inflated prices.

There were more than 1,500 victims — most of them elderly investors who lost their life savings, it was reported in the New York Daily News.

In total they were fleeced out of more than $40million. Authorities said Romano made about $4million.

Last month, the judge signed a $7million forfeiture order against him, of which he still owes the government more than $5million.

Romano was sentenced to less than the 20 years maximum behind bars that he faced for wire and mail fraud.

Since his conviction he was plotting for revenge against the government.

Romano sought the help of the informant in finding a contract killer.

The undercover agents met with him at the Nassau County jail where he was locked up during recent restitution hearings.

He represented himself at the hearings.

Romano proposed the undercovers assault another associate of his for $3,000 as a test, which, if successfully carried out, would lead to another 'big job, some serious work,' according to the complaint.

Romano was involved in a financial dispute with the man he wanted attacked.

The meeting was recorded with secret audio and video devices worn by the agent.

Undercover agents told Mirkovic that the associate had been assaulted and showed him a staged photo of the attack.

After hearing the news he allegedly offered them the  $40,000 contract on Bianco and Gatz.

The agents were paid $12,000 as a down payment toward the 
double hit and the balance was supposed to be paid after the judge and 
prosecutor were killed.

Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said, as reported in the New York Daily News: 'Romano thought he was buying revenge.

'Instead, he bought the full force of the law along with a possible life sentence.'
