With her colourful pom-poms by her side and her svelte frame, this student looks like an average cheerleader.

However, in a video that's now gone viral online, Patricia Ballesteros reveals that despite her slender arms, she possesses incredible strength.

In the footage, which has spread across social media, the 15-year-old schoolgirl, from Mesa in Arizona, can be seen squatting a barbel carrying 300lbs - more than the weight of a giant panda.

Patricia, who studies at Desert Ridge High School, is part of the cheer squad which has been crowned State Champions for the past two years.

The slender powerhouse spends extra time in the weights room to strengthen her legs which helps with her routines.

And despite the attention, Patricia insists she has no plans to stop strengthening.

Pretty Patricia says her trainers encourage her to push herself because they know she can be a great athlete

She said: 'For the people who already know me they knew I could lift.

'But it was definitely surprising to them when they heard about the video going viral.

'As for the people who don't, they didn't see it coming, because 300lbs is a lot to squat.

'I became strong by having amazing coaches who pushed me beyond my limits to see my potential as an athlete.

'I also put in extra time in the weight room and cheer during summer break so I can come back to the school each year stronger than I was before.'
