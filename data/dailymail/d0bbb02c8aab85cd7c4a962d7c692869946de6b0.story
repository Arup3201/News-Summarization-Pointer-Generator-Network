Jordan Grant, 17, died after suffering a cardiac arrest

Heartbroken parents have described their shock after witnessing the sudden death of their 17-year-old son.

Amateur footballer Jordan Grant, fell unconscious as his father drove 
him to his first shift at a Waitrose store in Walton-le-Dale,
Lancashire.

Paramedics were called to the scene, but despite best efforts they were unable to revive the teenager and he was pronounced dead.

It is believed Jordan suffered a sudden cardiac arrest, causing his heart to stop beating, and his family are now awaiting a final post-mortem report.

Parents Lisa and John Grant, who have two 
younger children, Lewis, 11, and Imogen, five, say they have have been 
overwhelmed by the number of messages from their son's friends.

More than 2,000 people have joined a memorial page on Facebook and a campaign has been launched to organise a minute’s applause during a Preston North End football match on February 14, one of Jordan's favourite teams.

Mother Lisa, 40, of Cottam, Preston, said: 'Jordan has been taken away from us and why, we will never know.

'He was fit as a fiddle. He had said 
he was feeling tired but with exams, his driving lessons and new job, we
just put it down to exhaustion.

'John and the paramedic kept on working on him for half-an-hour, but there was nothing.

'It was like switching a light off.'

Jordan collapsed during a car journey on Saturday morning and his father immediately drove home instructing his wife Lisa to call an ambulance, while he carried out 
CPR.

Paramedics arrived, but were unable 
to revive the student, who was a football fanatic and dreamed of forging a career as a sports journalist.

The family were informed by medics that Jordan had suffered a sudden cardiac arrest.

As a registered organ donor, several of Jordan's organs and tissues 
have been donated to transplant patients since his death.

Lisa added: 'Some good has to come out of our loss somewhere.'

Jordan was a season ticket 
holder at Preston North End and played for a number of junior sides. He also ran a
website with a friend, called Second City Fanatics, about American football.

Phil Moores, who managed Jordan when 
he played for Springfields Junior under-16s football team, said: 'Jordan
didn’t have a bad word for anyone.

'He played in any position without 
argument, and was a workhorse and a good player. He always turned up for
training and came for every match.

'He will be missed by a lot of people. It’s such a shame.'

Meanwhile messages paying tribute to the teenager have been posted on a Facebook memorial page.

Learning of her friend's death Emma 
Southworth, wrote: 'I am actually lost for words because I still don’t 
want to believe this is true.

'Honestly, Jord, you were the 
greatest person in this world and they couldn’t have taken a better 
person away.

'I will never ever forget all the good memories we shared 
together, all the laughs and the smiles you made us have either.'

Father John, 42, said: 'It is totally out of the blue. Everyone says they have the perfect son, but Jordan really was.

'He was so well thought of by everyone. No one had a bad word to say about him.'

Sid Hughes, principal at Newman College, described Jordan as an 'outstanding and popular student who had made his mark'.

He said: 'We are shocked and saddened. Jordan was a bright and intelligent young man studying for his A-levels.

'He had already received some outstanding marks and was highly regarded by his teachers.

'His loss is deeply felt by the staff and students of the college, and our thoughts and sympathies are with his family.'

Prayers were said for Jordan at a local church and funeral arrangements are yet to be confirmed.

Parish priest Rev Robert Horn said: 'Our thoughts are with the family and we will continue to pray for them and be as available as we can to support them.'

Charity Cardiac Risk in the Young estimates a dozen young people die from an arrest every week.
