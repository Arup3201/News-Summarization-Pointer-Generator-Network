Banned: Transgender footballer, Aeris Houlihan, 32, has been banned from playing for her local women's team by the FA

A transgender footballer has been banned from playing for her local women's team until two years after her gender reassignment operation.

Despite holding a UK passport and driving licence stating that she is female, Aeris Houlihan, 32, has been told by the Football Association that she can only play with men.

Ms Houlihan now faces a wait of nearly two and a half years to play competitively with other women, even though she has provided FA bosses with medical proof that her hormone levels are identical to that of a natural-born female.

Ms Houlihan said that the verdict came after the FA admitted to her that their legislation for transgender applicants is outdated.

'It's really disappointing and doesn't make any sense, I just want to play football,' Ms Houlihan said.

'It's not like I want to play for Barcelona, I just want to play for my local club.'

England fan Ms Houlihan has been on Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) for eight months and is due to have her operation in March next year.

She applied to the FA in June to play for Sunday League Football Team, Middleton Park Ladies FC in Leeds, and was asked to provide a doctor's letter to verify her female hormone levels.

After providing medical evidence with the backing of her hormone doctor, Ms Houlihan said she was then repeatedly ignored by the FA for five months.

She said she received one message from the FA to say that England Women's National Football Team manager, Hope Powell's sacking had affected her case before finally hearing back from them in October.

She was then told that she could not play for her local team and would be unable to appeal this decision.

Ms Houlihan said: 'My hormone doctor 
was disgusted with the decision. I have lost all the testosterone 
advantage males have and I'm far too weak to play for the men's team.

'The
 FA didn't even bother to look at my hormone levels or my blood test 
results, which are the same as any other woman's. They are blind and 
need to look at the evidence in front of them.'

Middleton
 Park Ladies FC are also appalled by the FA's ruling and have voiced 
their support of Ms Houlihan, who can now only participate in friendlies
 with her team.

'We support 
the fact she would like to play in a Ladies team as she is now legally a
 women, she has a British passport and she should be allowed to compete 
as a woman, just as she is allowed to live as a woman in her everyday 
life,' the club said in a statement.

Outrage: Ms Houlihan said her hormone doctor was 'disgusted' with the FA's decision

'So as a club we fully support all our players who play for Middleton Park FC and will stand by them.'

Football
 has always been an important part of Ms Houlihan's life and she 
previously played for the St Mary's Men's side in the Yorkshire League.

She said: 'With the HRT, I need to keep active. Not only that, I love football - playing it and watching it. I never miss an England match, even when it's just a friendly.'

Ms Houlihan, who runs a popular YouTube channel discussing sex-change issues, added: 'A lot of transgender girls are quite shy and many of my subscribers have said I'm helping them out by going public with my unfair FA ruling.

'I feel obliged to carry this forward because there will be other people in my situation too. I'm representing something I believe in.'

A spokesman for The FA commented: 'The FA’s policy on trans inclusion in football was set following consultations with experts on the subject, as well as guidance from DCMS and the International Olympic Committee.

'Individuals undergoing gender reassignment after puberty are required to have had the relevant surgical changes completed at least two years previously, as well as hormonal therapy for a sufficient length of time to minimise gender-related advantages in football matches. 

'If an individual does not meet the requirements of the policy, they are not able to play football in their legally acquired gender.'

The FA have long campaigned for equality in football and have run campaigns and initiatives to increase lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) representation in the sport.

However, policy dictates that transgender players must have had their sex reassignment surgery completed for at least two years before they can be registered to play in FA competition with their acquired gender.

Players must also have undergone hormone therapy for a sufficient length of time to minimise any gender-related advantages they may have while playing football, so as to ensure a fair competition.

Children who undergo gender reassignment before puberty are allowed to be registered as their acquired gender.

The criteria is not written into the FA rule book.

On the FA's website it is stated: 'An individual’s sexual orientation or gender identity should never be a barrier to participating in, and enjoying, our national sport.'

In order to meet that requirement The FA has pledged to identify the boundaries that prevent LGBT people from engaging with football and ensure that 'every opportunity is given to enable members of gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans communities to participate and progress within their chosen area of participation in football'.

The FA is also dedicated to tackling all forms of homophobic, bi-phobic and transphobic language and behaviour – whether by spectators, players, coaches or other participants.
