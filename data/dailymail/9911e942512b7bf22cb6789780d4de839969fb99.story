According to the latest collection of national security details leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency impersonated Facebook in an attempt to trick users into downloading malicious code in its attempt to install malware on 'millions' of computers.

The intelligence agency reportedly deployed malware code tailored to target specific machines. Once inside, the code gives the NSA total control of the computer.

The NSA dubbed the Facebook trick QUANTUMHAND.

Spies: The NSA used Facebook in its efforts to install malware on computers as part of its 'Owning the Net' program

The program was first reported by Glenn Greenwald at The Intercept.

'In some cases the NSA has masqueraded as a fake Facebook server, using 
the social media site as a launching pad to infect a target’s computer 
and exfiltrate files from a hard drive,' Greenwald reports, based on classified documents given to him by Snowden.

'[The NSA] has sent out spam emails laced with the malware, which can be tailored to covertly record audio from a computer’s microphone and take snapshots with its webcam,' Greenwald reports. 'The hacking systems have also enabled the NSA to launch cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying access to websites.'

The program initially was tested on 'about a dozen targets' before it became more widely used in 2010, according to the report.

Masquerade: The NSA posed as a Facebook server to gain access to private computers

The program was started as a way to hit about 100 to 150 'hard-to-reach' targets. However, the malware has since spread to potentially millions of computers across the world.

The malware was potentially able to infect so many computers by using an automated system the NSA calls TURBINE.

TURBINE gave NSA agents the ability to access - or even destroy - computers on a 'massive scale,' Fox News reports.

'One implant, codenamed UNITEDRAKE, can be used with a variety of “plug-ins” that enable the agency to gain total control of an infected computer,' Greenwald reports.'An implant plug-in named CAPTIVATEDAUDIENCE, for example, is used to take over a targeted computer’s microphone and record conversations taking place near the device.

'Another, GUMFISH, can covertly take over a computer’s webcam and snap photographs. FOGGYBOTTOM records logs of Internet browsing histories and collects login details and passwords used to access websites and email accounts. GROK is used to log keystrokes. And SALVAGERABBIT exfiltrates data from removable flash drives that connect to an infected computer,' he continues. 

This and other malware efforts are part of what the Agency calls its 'Owning the Net' program.
