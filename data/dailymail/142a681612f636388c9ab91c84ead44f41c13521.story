Les Ferdinand believes English football remains inherently racist, claiming John Terry was only saying what most people in the game think when he racially abused Ferdinand’s cousin, Anton, in 2011.

Speaking to Sir Trevor Phillips as part of a Channel 4 documentary on race to be screened on Thursday, QPR’s director of football also claimed the fact that he has only once been offered a route into football management since retiring as a player did not reflect well on the game in this country either.

But his views on the Terry controversy, which led to the Chelsea skipper being stripped of the England captaincy, banned for four matches and fined £220,000, are most damning.

QPR director of football Les Ferdinand says that he believes English football remains inherently racist 

Ferdinand claimed John Terry was  saying what most people in the game think in his racial abuse incident

Ferdinand feels that football handled the situation ‘terribly’, even though the FA charged Terry with using ‘abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour’ which ‘included a reference to the ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race of Ferdinand’ less than a fortnight after Terry was acquitted in court.

Asked by Phillips for his view on the Terry incident, Ferdinand said: ‘I suppose it was disbelief really, that the England captain would use language like that on a football field, or anywhere in fact.’

But it is when Phillips then asked Ferdinand for his view on ‘how the game handled it’ that the former England striker put the situation into a wider context.

Terry and Anton Ferdinand clashed during QPR's win over Chelsea in 2012 and Terry was stripped of the England captaincy, fined £220,000 and given a four-match ban after being charged by the FA

Ferdinand feels that football handled the situation ‘terribly’ and that it could have been put to bed quicker

Weeks before the FA charge, Terry had been cleared of racial abuse at Westminster Magistrates' Court

‘Terribly,’ he responded. ‘I think it’s a situation that could have been put to bed quite quickly.

‘And when you look at the game and the disproportion of black coaches in the game, maybe they’re not actually saying what John Terry said, but are they thinking it? Because I have to believe that.’

Phillips then asked Ferdinand how many times, in the 10 years since he stopped playing, he had been offered the opportunity to become a first-team coach.

The QPR director of football says he has only been offered one first-team coaching job in 10 years

Ferdinand says he knows black players who would like to go into management but don't get opportunities

‘Once,’ said Ferdinand. ‘Yeah once, when I came out of football I spoke to the then chairman of Bournemouth.

‘I know lots of players that I play with who’d love to go into coaching and management and they’ve done all the badges, but they just won’t get an opportunity.

‘We’ve been talking about this for 15 years now; the only difference is the venues seem to be getting better. When I first started doing it, it was in a little classroom, then we moved onto a hotel room, and now we’re at Parliament but the outcome’s still the same because we’ve not moved on.’
