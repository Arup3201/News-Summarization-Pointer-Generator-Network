Elizabeth Taylor didn’t do things by halves.

And even in death, that holds true, as the announcement of the auction of her incredible  £20million world-renowned collection of jewellery proves.

The Hollywood legend amassed a dazzling array of 269 diamonds, pearls, rubies, rings, necklaces and a tiara in her lifetime and it will all go under the hammer.

The two-day sale in December, which is 
expected to raise more than £20million, will be preceded by a 
three-month global tour that will also display couture, fine art and 
memorabilia belonging to the actress, who died aged 79 from heart 
failure in March.

Several of the most valuable pieces to go on sale will be related to Miss Taylor’s lengthy and complicated relationship with Richard Burton, whom she famously married and divorced twice.

‘This is without a doubt the greatest private collection of jewellery ever assembled in one place,’ said Christie’s Americas chairman and president Marc Porter.

The collection includes everything ‘from
her most jaw-dropping diamonds, gems and one-of-a-kind historic jewels 
to... never-before-seen keepsakes’, he said.

Leading the gala evening sale of 89 
top lots on December 13 and 14 is Taylor’s iconic, 33.19-carat white 
diamond ring, a 1968 gift from Burton after the actor purchased it at 
auction for $300,000.

The 
trustees of Taylor’s estate have renamed it The Elizabeth Taylor 
Diamond, and it is estimated to fetch between £1.57million and 
£2.19million.

Previous 
auctions of memorabilia belonging to celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe 
and Jackie Onassis have soared to many times their pre-sale estimates.

‘It
is her depth of knowledge about fine jewellery that truly impresses,’ 
Francois Curiel, international jewellery director for Christie’s, said 
of Miss Taylor.

‘It was 
clear that she possessed an expert’s eye for craftsmanship, rarity, 
quality and history. She collected the best pieces from the best 
periods.’

Among the pieces 
is a 203-grain (equivalent to 55 carat) pear-shaped 14th-century pearl 
known as La Peregrina, once owned by England’s Queen Mary I also known 
as 'Bloody Mary' and later passed on to Spanish queens Margarita and 
Isabel.

Burton bought it in 1969 at auction 
for £23,000, and Miss Taylor commissioned Cartier to design a new 
ruby-and-diamond necklace mount. It is estimated to sell for 
£1.25million to £1.88million.

At
the other end of the spectrum, bidders will have a chance to buy Miss 
Taylor’s two, diamond-set wedding bands from her marriages to Burton, 
estimated to fetch only £4,000 to £6,00

Burton, for Elizabeth Taylor's 40th birthday, 1972 Estimate: £400,000 -

From Mike Todd, another of Miss 
Taylor’s seven husbands, there is an antique diamond tiara, which the 
star wore to the 1957 Academy Awards, that is estimated to fetch £40,000
to £60,000.

In keeping with
the actress’s humanitarian work, a portion of the proceeds from 
exhibitions, events and publications related to the auction will be 
donated to The Elizabeth Taylor Aids Foundation, which the actress 
founded in 1991.
