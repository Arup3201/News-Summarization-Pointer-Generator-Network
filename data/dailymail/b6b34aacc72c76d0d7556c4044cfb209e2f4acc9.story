The family of James McNair, the comedian killed in the New Jersey Turnpike crash that also seriously injured Tracy Morgan, settled a wrongful death claim with Wal-Mart for a reported $10million sum.

Denita and Jamel, McNair's children, will split the payout awarded for the June 7 accident that saw a Wal-Mart 18-wheeler hit a limo carrying Morgan and his friend.

Their lawyer Daryl Zaslow will take a $3million cut, according to court papers.

The family of comedian James McNair, (left and right) who was the mentor to 30 Rock star Tracy Morgan received a reported $10million payout from Wal-Mart

Denita and Jamel, McNair's children, will split the payout awarded for the accident on June 7 

Zaslow wrote that he was 'able to convince Wal-Mart' that the hefty settlement would outweigh any potential losses the conglomerate would face with a highly publicized lawsuit, according to a filing obtained by DNAinfo. 

He said the $10million settlement was a 'truly outstanding result,' especially because McNair's past income was not large enough  for his children to 'project a significant lost-wage claim'.

According to DNAinfo, McNair, who was 62 at the time of his death, worked part-time at the Salvation Army when he wasn't doing stand-up gigs. 

The settlement was originally announced in January but the sum was undisclosed. Wal-Mart feared publicizing the large payout would negatively impact the superstore's business. 

But the amount was revealed in legal documents filed last month in Westchester Surrogate's Court. 

Denita, 19, wrote in an affidavit included in the filing that 'no amount of money could replace' her father, but that the settlement 'greatly exceeds anything I imagined and I could not be more grateful.' 

When the settlement was first announced in January, Zaslow said Walmart had 'accepted their responsibility' in the crash.   

'They caused extensive damage to this family and more than stepped up to the plate and took care of this family,' he said. 'Ultimately they did the right thing by the McNairs.'

He added, 'No amount of money can replace what they've lost, but what they've got will take care of them and allow them to move forward, and their father would be happy for that.'

The settlement agreed between the McNair's and Wal-Mart allowed the superstore to admit no liability for the crash.

Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said the company and the family worked closely to reach an agreement and that Wal-Mart was working toward settlements with others injured in the accident.

'We know there is nothing we can do to change what happened to Mr. McNair,' Buchanan said. 

'We will continue to work to conclude all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident and we're committed to doing what's right.'

Kevin Roper, the truck driver, has been charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto for the summer crash in New Jersey.

The police allege that Roper had been driving his vehicle for more than 24 hours before the fatal crash.

In addition, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that Roper was driving up to 65 mph in a 45 mph zone just seconds before the crash.

Morgan, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in the crash, has filed a lawsuit against Wal-Mart.  

Morgan, a former Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock star, suffered a traumatic brain injury in the accident, according to his lawyer, and his lawsuit against Wal-Mart is proceeding in federal court
