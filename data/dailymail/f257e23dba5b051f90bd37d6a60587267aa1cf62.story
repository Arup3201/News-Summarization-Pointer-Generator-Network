A propaganda video showing North Korean soldiers invading South Korea and taking 150,000 American citizens hostage has been posted online.

The four-minute film, entitled A Short, Three-Day War, has been put up on a website used by the secretive state to show off videos in which it imagines gaining supremacy over the United States and other foes.

In the film, which is set to stirring music, North Korean troops are shown bombarding South Korea with rockets and bombs before scores of soldiers carrying the North Korean flag stream in, triumphantly.

Fantasy footage: The new video depicts North Korea winning an imaginary three-day war against South Korea

North Korea has become more aggressive towards the West since UN sanctions were tightened recently

A male voiceover describes the imaginary military onslaught stage by stage, while images of the Seoul cityscape, North Korean military aircraft, and American aircraft carriers flash on screen.

The narrator tells how paratroopers land in Seoul, taking the city with accomplished street-fighting, while thousands of tanks roll across snow-covered landscapes.

He says: 'The crack stormtroops will occupy Seoul and other cities and take 150,000 US citizens as hostage.'

Meanwhile US Navy ships in the region are destroyed, and 150,000 American troops and expats are taken hostage.

The narrator goes to describe the state's lofty imaginings, in which North Korea gains supremacy in a lightening, three-day battle after destroying American military bases on the Pacific island of Guam and Japan.

He adds: 'The troops will occupy Seoul and other cities',

The clip ends with an image of North Korean troops holding their rifles aloft in triumph as the sun goes down on their successful military onslaught.

As the film was released, the New York Times reported a spokesman for the North Korean People’s Army telling the state-run Korean Central News Agency that 'the US should not forget that the Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, where B-52s take off, and naval bases in Japan proper and Okinawa, where nuclear-powered submarines are launched, are within the striking range of the D.P.R.K.’s precision strike means.'

This threat and that implicit in the video, that was posted on Uriminzokkiri, which distributes state propaganda, are the latest in a string of threats from the increasingly unhinged state.

Since tighter UN sanctions against North Korea were announced, it has threatened nuclear war against America, and has verbally scrapped a decades-old ceasefire in the war with South Korea.

Another recent propaganda video showed the White House under attack, and US President Barack Obama burning in the flames.

The video is designed to demonstrate North Korea's impressive military prowess
