Two couples in California kidnapped, gagged and bound a 44-year-old woman inside a squalid garage, demanding that her husband pay up a six-figure ransom he couldn't possibly afford.

Detectives in Rowland Heights, Los Angeles County, say that the woman was denied food and water for two days and was made to relieve herself in a bucket.

'The victim was located in very squalid conditions in a cluttered garage, on the floor,' said Captain Merrill Ladenheim, of the LA County Sheriff's Office, according to the San Gabriel Valley Tribune.

'She was duct taped. Her hands were bound.'

A 44-year-old woman was kept inside this squalid garage for two days without food or water. Her kidnappers demanded a $110,000 ransom

The victim was gagged and bound amid piles of random objects, and was forced to relieve herself in a bucket

Investigators say the plot was hatched after one of the victim's co-workers, Judith Maldonado, overheard that the woman had saved up some money with her husband of 20 years.

Then on Monday, when the victim missed her bus, Maldonado and boyfriend Francisco Inacua-Rosas offered her a ride home. The couple told the victim they had to stop by a restaurant to pick up some food.

While on the way there, Inacua-Rosas text-messaged his sister and her boyfriend, Rocio Inacua and Uziel Figueroa, and told them to meet up at the restaurant.

'Both Rocio Inacuna and Uziel Figueroa then, at gunpoint, forced the victim down the floorboard, bound, gagged and blindfolded her, and drove her to that garage in Rowland Heights,' Nishida said.

Inacua called the victim's husband and demanded $110,000, a sum far larger than the victim had.

The husband called the police, who tracked down the kidnappers in two days.

'Upon being rescued from those squalid conditions, she removed her blindfold, the duct tape, and immediately saw the lead detective, who happened to be in the door of the garage,' Ladenheim said.

'She immediately hugged the detective,' he added. 'It was a very, very emotional rescue, and we are happy to report that she is safe and expected to make a full recovery.'

The four — Maldonado, 40, Inacua-Rosas, 34, Inacua, 32, and Figueroa, 32 — are being held on $2 million bail each.

They face life in prison without the possibility of parole.
