A news report on Thursday that revealed secret communications between President Barack Obama and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has a top Republican lawmaker accusing Obama of playing 'footsie' with the 'enemy' just as the deadline for a nuclear deal with the country approaches.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Obama sent Khamenei a letter last month assuring him that airstrikes about ISIS in the country were not intended to undermine Iranian ally and Syrian President Bashar al Assad. 

The letter allegedly indicated that the U.S. may be willing to work with Iran in the fight against radical Islamic militants ravaging the region if it satisfied a Nov. 24 deadline to come to an agreement with negotiators about its nuclear program.

Arizona Sen. John McCain, pictured here yesterday at a Veteran's Day event,  accused President Barack Obama on Thursday of playing 'footsie' with the 'enemy' when he sent Iran's supreme leader a letter indicating a willingness on behalf of the U.S. to work more closely with the country in the fight against ISIS if it agreed to proposed regulations on its nuclear program

The Journal claims this is the fourth time Obama has written the leader of the Middle Eastern country since 2009 to offer a truce of sorts.

The White House spokesman refused on Thursday to comment on the report, stating that he is 'not in a position to discuss private correspondence between the President and any world leader.'

However, 'I can tell you that the policy that the President and his administration have articulated about Iran remains unchanged,' he told reporters. 

'The United States will not cooperate militarily with Iran [in the campaign against ISIS.] We won't share intelligence with them,' he said. 

'But their interests in this outcome is something that's been widely commented upon and something on a couple of occasions has been discussed on the sidelines of other conversations,' he noted.

National Security Advisor Susan Rice also refused to confirm the letter to reporters on Friday nor did she deny that it was sent.

As I have said 'repeatedly in public,' as have other administration officials, 'we are in no way' engaged 'in any military coordination' with Iran as it regards to ISIL, she said, using an alternative name for ISIS.

Rice said the U.S. takes eliminating the threat from ISIS seriously, 'but we are not doing so in coordination with the government of Iran.'

She also asserted that 'there is no linkage' between the administration's military actions against ISIS and the Iran nuclear plan.

Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a constant critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy, had blasted the president on Thursday for putting rebels of the Syrian government being trained by the U.S. to fight ISIS in harm's way by promising Iran that Assad is not under siege. 

'Now  it is really an immoral situation, and I don’t use that word lightly,' McCain, the ranking member of the Senate's committee on Armed Services, told MSNBC on Thursday. 

'They are now going to train Syrians to go in and fight against ISIS and at the same time allowing Bashar Assad to slaughter them with barrel bombs and air attacks and other attacks,' he contended. 'Every time we strike ISIS, then Bashar Assad steps up his attacks on the Free Syrian Army.'

Continuing, McCain said, 'As I say, it’s immoral, yet somehow we are playing footsie with the Iranians and hope they will somehow have an effect on ISIS.' 

President Barack Obama, right, talks to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell before the start of a Cabinet Meeting in the Cabinet Room at the White House on Friday. Obama will meet next with GOP leaders, who will undoubtedly chastize him over the letter to Iran

In a joint statement with fellow Armed Services committee member and close Senate ally Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, McCain called Obama's overtures to Iran 'outrageous.'

'This is the same Iranian regime that has been complicit in the rise of ISIS by pushing a violent sectarian agenda throughout the Middle East --backing radical Shia militias and politicians in Iraq, doing everything in its power to aid the killing machine of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, arming Hamas terrorists with advanced rockets in Gaza, and orchestrating Hezbollah's dispatch of thousands of fighters from Lebanon into Syria,' the GOP duo said.

Iran, they said, 'cares more about trying to weaken America and push us out of the Middle East than cooperating with us.'

Going down this path will 'harm U.S. national security interests, as well as our relationships with our closest regional allies and partners, in pursuit of the illusory goal of rapprochement with the current Iranian leadership,' they argued. 'The consequences of this ill-conceived bargain would destroy the Syrians' last best chance to live in freedom from the brutal Assad regime.'

House Speaker John Boehner also expressed skepticism that any good would come of Obama's outreach to Khamenei.

'I don’t trust the Iranians, I don’t think we need to bring them into this,' Boehner said on Thursday.

'I would hope that the negotiations that are under way are serious negotiations, but I have my doubts,' the GOP leader, who is scheduled to meet with Obama about a number of issues this afternoon, said.

Outgoing GOP legislator and current House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told MSNBC on Friday that Obama's letter was unhelpful to the overall U.S. strategy in the region.

'I can tell you that it is causing real problems with our Sunni Arab League partners in the fight against ISIS,' Rogers said, according to Politico. 'It’s really concerning.'

The Michigan congressman suggested that Iran may have leaked the letter to gain the upper hand in negotiations.

'Just because the enemy of your enemy sometimes wants to help you, that doesn’t mean they’re still not your adversary,' he said.

Putting it bluntly, a senior congressional source who spoke to Fox News, said of Obama's back channeling with Iran: 'This f***s up everything.'

Obama gave brief remarks before the meeting to reporters before reporters were ushered out

The clock on Obama's efforts to talk Iran into signing the nuclear deal is ticking as Republicans, who favor greater sanctions on the country, are now slated to take control of both chambers of the legislative branch in the new year.

Bipartisan legislation sponsored by Mark Kirk of Illinois, a Republican, and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat, could go into effect as soon as January.

'The best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is to quickly pass the bipartisan Menendez-Kirk legislation—not to give the Iranians more time to build a bomb,' Kirk said Wednesday, per the Journal.

On Thursday McCain said that the U.S. has 'already given away the store by allowing them the right to enrich and not putting in check both the development of warheads and the means to deliver them.' 

McCain said any efforts by the president to build a better relationship with the country  that is 'spreading disorder and unrest throughout the region ' is misguided.

'They are not our friend. They are our enemy. Are we are treating them as somebody that we can continue to do business with,' he said. 

'This is a foreign policy that is off the rails.'

Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen came to his party leader's defense on Friday, saying the letter was 'not outrageous' as McCain and Graham had stated.

'Presidents use backchannels all the time,' he told CNN. 

'Look, you don’t have to trust Iran to understand that the United States and Iran do have a common interest in trying to defeat ISIS and I thought Sen. McCain and Sen. Graham wanted to do everything possible to defeat ISIS,' he said, goading the GOP senators.
