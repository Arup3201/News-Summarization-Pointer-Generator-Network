These stunning images reveal that even in the most inhospitable of environments, life can thrive - and create incredibly beautiful effects as it does.

The images show ice bubbles in Abraham Lake, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains in Canada.

The rare phenomenon occurs each winter in the man-made lake, as the plants on the lake bed release methane gas, which freezes as it comes closer to the cold lake surface.

Ice bubbles in Abraham Lake, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains in Canada. The bubbles are created from methane released by plants in the lake, which freezes  as it rises through the lake

Ice bubbles occur during the months of 
November and March when the lake is completely frozen over.

The plants 
on the lake bed release methane gas, which freezes as it comes closer to
 the cold lake surface. 

The bubbles keep stacking up below the frozen lake once the weather gets colder and colder during the winter season.

The result is these incredible ice bubbles which are frozen in place as long as the water remains solid.

Located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains on the North Saskatchewan River, the rare phenomenon occurs each winter in the man-made lake.

The simple nature of the ice bubbles composition makes the images even more remarkable and almost appears to look more like a painting than a photograph.

But they are in fact taken by a 40-year-old American photographer, Chip Phillips, who simply snapped the results by walking onto the frozen lake.

Abraham Lake has become a popular destination for photographers but Chip warned it isn't for the weak or the weary.

The ice bubbles occur every year at Abraham Lake, located at the foot of the Rocky Mountains in Canada

The photographer also captured beautiful images of the ice on the lake cracking, forming amazing patterns as it does

The photographer from Spokane Washington said: 'It's necessary to walk out on the ice to photograph the bubbles; the icy surface is around 22cm deep.

'I usually use crampons to avoid slipping but on one of my first trips to the lake, a giant gust of wind came barrelling across the lake, picked me up and threw me back on the ice.

'I had to carefully walk back to safety ducking along the way to avoid it from happening again.

'My forehead was bleeding a little, and I think I might have gotten a slight concussion so I am very careful now when I go out.'
