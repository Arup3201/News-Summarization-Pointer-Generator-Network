'Stateless': Sapper Poloko Hiri is now being denied citizenship in the UK due to a speeding fine which he received in April 2011

He has served in the British Army for four years with an ‘exemplary record’, but Poloko Hiri has now been ordered out of the UK – because of a speeding offence.

The 32-year-old from Botswana has had his application for citizenship rejected by the UK Border Agency who claimed the single offence was a sign of ‘bad character’.

Officials ruled the soldier should be bracketed with murderers, rapists and drug dealers – ordering him to quit the country by next Friday.

It is a decision that effectively leaves Sapper Hiri stateless as he faces certain arrest, prosecution and up to 25 years in jail if he returns to Botswana which deems enlisting in a foreign army a criminal offence.

His case has left the Government accused once again of ‘betraying’ the military, following round after round of spending cuts.

And it comes days after the furore over Fiji-born Lance Corporal Bale Baleiwai, 32, a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, who was threatened with deportation last month because he was disciplined by his commanding officer for a fight with a colleague in 2010.

Following an outcry, he was granted an 11th hour reprieve.

Campaigners for Sapper Hiri contrast his case with that of foreigners who have been allowed to stay despite awful crimes, such as Iraqi Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car.

Sapper Hiri’s supporters have urged David Cameron to intervene, pointing out the UKBA’s decision is at odds with the Premier’s pledge to uphold the Military Covenant, society’s duty of care to servicemen.

Sapper Hiri said: ‘For speeding, I am being treated the same as a  murderer or drug lord or a burglar.

‘I am trapped. If I go back home I’ll be thrown in jail. If I stay here, I’ll be breaking the law.’

The veteran, who has a six-month-old baby girl Peo in London with his ex-girlfriend, enlisted as a Commonwealth serviceman in the Royal Engineers in August 2008.

He was eager to fulfil his dream of being a soldier but was too old to join the Botswana Defence Force.

He said: ‘Iraq and Afghanistan were still going on. I knew I might have to put my life on the line and go to a warzone. I was prepared for that.’

Sapper Hiri, who lives in Leeds, became a design draughtsman – drawing up plans for bases, roads and other construction projects – and joined 73 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 21 Engineer Regiment.

He completed exercises in the UK and Canada. In August 2011, he gave 12 months notice he wanted to leave the Army to take a degree in archaeological technology at London South Bank University – a move ‘fully supported’ by commanders.

In April this year, he applied for British citizenship ahead of his Army leaving date, August 31. But the UKBA rejected his bid because he had received a £100 fine and five penalty points for speeding on the M1.

He had been doing 81mph in a 50mph roadworks zone at 1.30am.

His officer commanding, Major Chloe Plimmer, wrote to the agency praising his ‘exemplary record of conduct’ in the Army.

The Army was ‘genuinely concerned’ that Sapper Hiri could be arrested and prosecuted if he was sent home to Botswana.

Veterans Aid chief executive Dr Hugh Milroy, who has been helping fight Sapper Hiri’s case, said: ‘We recruited Poloko and now we are treating him as if he is illegal.

‘It springs to my mind these people appear disposable, almost like slavery, and no-one seems to care.’

Since January, Veterans Aid has dealt with 70 former Commonwealth soldiers who face being thrown out of Britain.

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘Each claim for settlement is considered on individual circumstances and in line with published policy.’
