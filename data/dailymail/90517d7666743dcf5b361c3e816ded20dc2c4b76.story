As fans continue to mourn the passing of their favorite Vulcan, Leonard Nimoy's passion  for photography - and the women he put in front of the lens - is also being recognized.

Nimoy, called the 'Conscience of Star Trek' by the show's creator, once said he used photography to express the idea of feminine power. 

After eight years of taking photographs of plus-sized women, Nimoy published a collection titled The Full Body Project in 2007, which featured obese women photographed in the nude. 

It was when Nimoy was doing an exhibit for a different photography collection that he was turned to the idea of shooting fuller-figured women.

For The Full Body Project, Nimoy found new subjects in the plus-size burlesque group The Fat-Bottom Revue

He was inspired by their late founder Heather MacAllister, who he recalled once told him 'whenever a fat person steps on stage to perform, and it's not the butt of a joke, that's a political statement'

He said a 250-pound woman approached him after a presentation and told Nimoy he only worked with models that had a certain body type, according to the New York Times. 

She then asked Nimoy if he would be interested in working with her despite her different shape, and he said yes.  

Nimoy was nervous the day of the shoot, afraid he wouldn't do his new subject justice, he told NPR. 

'I think that's a reflection of something that's prevalent in our culture,' he said. 'We are sort of conditioned to see a different body type as acceptable and maybe look away when the other body type arrives.' 

But Nimoy did not look away, instead he pointed his camera right at her. And his pictures immediately sparked an interest and a response from the public. 

And a new passion had sparked inside Nimoy. 

The pictures feature the women dancing, laughing and proudly staring straight into the camera. Nimoy said the pictures show the women's strong self-esteem

'These women are projecting an image that is their own,' he said. 'And one that also stems from their own story rather than mine'

And with that Nimoy became an unlikely, but passionate, size-acceptance advocate. 

He told the New York Times the book was a 'direct response to the pressure women face to conform to a size two'. 

The pictures feature the women dancing, laughing and proudly staring straight into the camera - often times fully nude. Nimoy said the pictures show the women's strong self-esteem, he wrote for R.Michelson Galleries, where the pictures were featured in. 

'These women are projecting an image that is their own,' he said. 'And one that also stems from their own story rather than mine.' 

It wasn't a far step for Nimoy, who has a history of championing women.

In the 1960s while he was filming Star Trek, Nimoy found out that Nichelle Nichols was not getting paid the same amount as her male co-stars. 

Nimoy approached the managers of the show and immediately had her pay equalized, he confirmed to TrekMovie.com 

And in the 1970s he fought for Nichols again, telling producers he refused to do Spock's voice in the animated Star Trek series if Nichols, who had yet to receive the offer, was hired as well. 

Tributes to the star have been pouring in since news broke he had died on Friday morning following a long battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

His Star Trek co-star William Shatner, who has recently come under fire for missing Nimoy's funeral to attend a charity event, said: 'I loved him like a brother. 

'We will all miss his humor, his talent, and his capacity to love.'
