Fernando Alonso says he has not signed with McLaren for next season and remains undecided about his future in Formula One.

The two-time world champion says he is still 'considering what's the best decision' for his career and 'nothing has been decided' so far even though he already has 'an idea' of what he wants to do.

Alonso's contract with Ferrari is up at the end of year. He has been with the Italian team since 2010.
