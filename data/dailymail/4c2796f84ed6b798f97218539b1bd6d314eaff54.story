In a significant blow for Tony Abbott ahead of the new year, female support for an Australian Prime Minister has now dropped to its lowest level in almost two decades.

Despite his lack of popularity with women, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop believes Mr Abbott should remain the Minister for Women.

'I believe that we have had to take some very tough decisions since the election and we have and they are not always popular,' she told Today Show host Lisa Wilkinson.

Despite his lack of popularity with women, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop believes Tony Abbott should remain the Minister for Women

Mr Abbott's facing dwindling support from male voters too, now as low as 2009 when he beat Malcolm Turnbull in the ballot for the Coalition leadership

Despite dwindling polls for the PM and the Coalition and the recent Cabinet reshuffle, Ms Bishop is seeking to remain positive. 'We are seeking to do the best for Australia, we're acting in Australia's national interest in trying to repair the budget and trying to find savings,' the Deputy Liberal Leader said on Monday

Tony Abbott's lack of popularity now mirrors the fall in support for newly elected PM John Howard some 18 years back.

Despite dwindling polls for the PM and the Coalition and the recent Cabinet reshuffle, Ms Bishop is seeking to remain positive.

'We are seeking to do the best for Australia, we're acting in Australia's national interest in trying to repair the budget and trying to find savings,' the Deputy Liberal Leader said.

However, she did concede that 'it's been a difficult time for us'.

And that is reflected in the dwindling support level for Mr Abbott from men too, which according to the latest Newspoll, which is published in The Australian newspaper, has crashed 10 points since the federal election. It is now at its lowest level since Mr Abbott toppled Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull for the leadership in 2009.

She also leapt to the defence of her embattled leader, who was criticised over his claim that his greatest achievement as Minister for Women was abolishing the carbon tax.

'I think the Prime Minister mentioned a number of things, not only the carbon tax,' she added.

'I think one of the most important things we can do is repair the budget and put Australia on a strong economic footing so that Australian women can realise their potential, can have the opportunity to have a job if they wish.'

'The PM has chosen to take that portfolio and I think it's important to have it in the office of the PM, it reflects the significance we attach to women's issues,' Julie Bishop said in response to questions as to whether Mr Abbott should relinquish the Minister for Women role

The PM - who was the target of Julia Gillard's famous misogyny speech - recently drew more fire for suggesting that sexism was behind criticism of his powerful chief of staff. 

Mr Abbott slapped down members of his own party following reports of growing tension between Peta Credlin, his top adviser, and coalition ministers, particularly Julie Bishop. 

'Do you really think that my chief of staff would be under this kind of criticism if her name was P-E-T-E-R as opposed to P-E-T-A?' Mr Abbott stated.

'I think people need to take a long hard look at themselves with some of these criticisms.' 

Recent polls have underscored Julie Bishop's increasing popularity, with her own approval rating as preferred Liberal Leader more than doubling in the past six months, second only to Malcolm Turnbull.

There was also the widely-reported argument between Ms Bishop and the PM, after she read media reports that a male colleague, Andrew Robb, would 'chaperone' her to the United Nations climate change conference in Lima, Peru.

But the Foreign Minister kept to message on Monday, stating that jobs and opportunity remain the government's focus, as the Coalition's support among female voters came in at 36 per cent for the past three months, down eight points since the federal poll.

She was adamant that there was no need for Mr Abbott to relinquish the role of Minister for Women.

'The PM has chosen to take that portfolio and I think it's important to have it in the office of the PM, it reflects the significance we attach to women's issues,' she said.

'The fact that it's held in the highest office in the land I think is a positive.'

Newspoll also revealed that, over the final quarter of 2014, Bill Shorten continues to hold a strong lead over Tony Abbott as preferred Prime Minister. Labor also enjoys stronger female support as the year comes to a close

Newspoll also revealed that, over the final quarter of 2014, Bill Shorten continues to hold a strong lead over Tony Abbott as preferred Prime Minister.

He has 41 per cent backing over Mr Abbott's 37.

The PM's dissatisfaction rating is at 55 per cent, against the Opposition Leader's 43. Labor's female support is up slightly to 38 per cent, two points better than the Coalition.
