A British Airways flight had to make an emergency landing as two drunken middle-aged women on board ran riot.

The pair aged 50 and 43 swore in front of children, refused to return to their seats and tried to force their way into the cockpit after being seen drinking Malibu from the bottle.

One passenger claimed they even threatened to track down and kill the family of a BA stewardess on the Gatwick to Tunisia flight.

A British Airways to Gatwick Airport in West Sussex had to be diverted to Lyon because two passengers became disruptive. Pictured is a passenger plane landing at Gatwick

Then it was claimed they hid in the Boeing 737-400’s toilet at 30,000ft for a smoke.

Its pilot diverted to Lyon, where French police boarded and threw them in cells for a night, then put them on a return flight.

The passenger told The Sun: 'They decided they were going to meet the captain and marched towards the cockpit. It was very frightening.'

The women may now be banned for life from British Airways.

A British Airways spokesman said: 'Monday's BA2664 service from Gatwick to Tunis was diverted to Lyon following the continued disruptive behaviour of two female passengers.

'Our customers and flying crew deserve a safe and enjoyable flight experience. We do not tolerate any disruptive behaviour on board our flights.'
