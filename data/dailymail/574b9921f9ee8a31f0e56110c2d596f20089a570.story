A Las Vegas woman on trial for directing her brother and son to murder her estranged husband was described Wednesday as a 'scorned woman' who wanted to cash in on the man's $250,000 insurance policy.

In the first day of her attempted murder and conspiracy trial, prosecutors said Amy Bessey planned the November 2012 hit on husband, Robert Bessey, just days before their divorce finalized so she could access the pile of cash, and hopefully his social security benefits too.

The 43-year-old had also allegedly started a romantic relationship with her biological son, Michael Bessey, 21, whom her ex-husband adopted as a child, and this is believed to be another reason she wanted him out of the way.

Planned: Prosecutors said Amy Bessey, 43, pictured in court on Wednesday, planned the November 2012 hit on husband, Robert Bessey, just days before their divorce finalized

Victim: Richard Bessey, pictured in court, survived the attempt on his life and testified in his ex-wife's trial

'A famous saying was repeated that hell hath no fury as a woman scorned, and the evidence in this case, is going to show that the defendant, Amy Bessey is that woman scorned,' prosecutor Sam Martinez said, according to ABC News.

Bessey faces up to 91 years in prison if she's convicted of the eight charges against her, which include attempted murder and conspiracy. She has pleaded not guilty in the case.

In the Las Vegas justice court, Martinez read out a text message her brother, Richard Pearson, 39, sent her prior to the assassination attempt, which said, 'I love it when a plan comes together.'

Accused: Amy Bessey, 42, allegedly plotted to kill her husband for his life insurance policy

'That ladies and gentlemen is a text 
message sent by Ric Pearson to his sister, the defendant, Amy Bessey, 
approximately six hours prior to Robert Bessey being shot in the head,' 
Martinez told jurors.

Bessey survived the attempt on his life and testified in his ex-wife's trial.

He said he was driving his usual route to work at 4:35 a.m. November 14 when a gunshot came from a gold SUV.

'I felt a hot sensation here and towards the back of my neck. I start feeling what I believe to be a bullet,' Bessey told the court. 'This is my sweatshirt. You can see the hole in the neck.'

The couple had been married for 18 years and had three kids together. They each had two children from prior relationships and Bessey adopted Amy Bessey's biological son Michael two years after they were married.

Robert Bessey also testified Wednesday that Michael had been pulling away from him to be closer to his wife after he returned from the military months before the shooting.

Bessey said Michael's move back into the home after he was dishonorably discharged caused friction between him and his wife. He said he noticed Michael's relationship with his mother had changed.

'They seemed to be closer or adult conversation, rather than mother-son,' Bessey testified.

Prosecutors also showed the court gas station surveillance video that captured Bessey's brother and son not far from the scene of the shooting in a gold SUV that police say was tied to the incident.

Police said the shooting followed another attempt at Robert Bessey's life, which involved a family friend. According to documents seen by Fox 5 News, the friend, Courtney Smith, gave Robert Bessey a Red Bull energy drink laced with arsenic in June 2012. Documents said Amy Pearson paid Smith $50,000 in the plot.

Amy Bessey was arrested in January 
for allegedly orchestrating the drive-by shooting after and her son 
began their romantic relationship.

Robert
Bessey was struck in the neck by the bullet but he survived and 
identified the SUV as belonging to Richard Pearson's girlfriend.

Michael
Bessey and Pearson 
were charged in the murder plot last year, but police only implicated 
Amy Bessey in January after her son told his cellmate that she had been 
involved.

She was arrested by Las Vegas police 
on charges of attempted murder, battery and conspiracy to commit murder 
against her husband, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported.

Robert
Bessey told detectives that his wife and son's 'close' relationship had
prompted the divorce, while Michael Bessey's ex-girlfriend said Amy was
also the reason they had broken up.

Relatives claimed the pair had an 'unnatural relationship' and one friend said they would go to nightclubs together and 'grab each other's buttocks', police said.

Plot: Michael Bessey, pictured brandishing a gun on his Facebook page, allegedly told his cellmate that he shot his father to get money from his life insurance plan so he could buy a truck

'Close': Michael Bessey, left, allegedly wrote his mother, right, a letter from jail saying: 'I miss touching you'

Robert Bessey also told police that 
he had read a letter his son had written to his wife from jail which 
said: 'I miss touching you'.

The man added that his wife and son both had made various statements wishing he were dead.

But Amy Bessey was only implicated in the gruesome plot when her son's cellmate, Tremel Palmer, claimed he told him that the three planned the killing and were shocked Mr Bessey survived.

Michael Bessey allegedly told Palmer that he was the one who had fired the bullet. He and Pearson then went to a diner for Amy Bessey to collect them, he allegedly said.

Michael Bessey added that he expected to receive a total of $400,000 from the death, with which he would buy a truck, while his mother would pay off her mortgage, police said.

Bessey said he wanted his father dead because he had physically abused his mother and mentally abused the family, the Journal-Review reported.

He added that he planned to blame the 
plot on his uncle, Richard Pearson, who recently finished a prison 
sentence, by claiming the man had forced him to get involved at 
gunpoint.

In an eerie twist following the shooting, Amy Pearson cooperated with police and handed over her brother and her son to police by identifying them in a video taken at a gas station near the scene.

After her son was arrested last November, she told the Review-Journal: 'I have no idea what's going on. I wish I did.'

Michael Bessey, Richard Pearson and Amy Pearson have all been charged with attempted murder with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit murder and battery with a deadly weapon resulting in substantial bodily harm. Richard Pearson was also charged with violation of parole.

Their trial is scheduled for February 2014.
