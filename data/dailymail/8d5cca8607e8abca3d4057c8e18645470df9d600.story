The two British tourists who died in Amsterdam earlier this week after taking white heroin they allegedly believed was cocaine, have been named. 

Shaun Brotherston, 20, and Bradley Price, 21, both from Plymouth, Devon, are believed to have died while on holiday in the Netherlands to celebrate Mr Brotherston's 21st birthday.

The young men were found dead in an Amsterdam hotel room next to traces of a white powder, local police have confirmed.

Both are believed to be former pupils of Tamarside Community College, now Marine Academy Plymouth, in St Budeaux, northwest Plymouth.

Mr Brotherston was a student at The University of St Mark and St John in Plymouth and worked at the Future Inn hotel in the city.

Mr Price and Mr Brotherston were best mates in life and death, one of their fathers said today.

Mr Price's father Julian said his son was 'one in a million' and he urged the victims' friends to 'learn from this tragic end'.

Julian Price wrote on Facebook: 'My heart is broken for you both, always together in life and now sadly in death, look after each other.'

He thanked their friends for their support through a day which has 'arguably been the most difficult time I've ever experienced'.

'I've read every message and comment, it's been heartbreaking but at the same time has humbled me and made me so proud that Brad was loved, admired with so many caring friends.

'He was one in a million, so talented, a master of every aspect of his life and will be so missed by everyone, he had it all.

'I will never forget him or stop loving him, he has left a huge hole in my broken heart.

'Please all of you learn from his tragic end, love each other and make him and Shaun proud, at least they have each other in death as they did in life.'

Shaun's mother Karen Brotherston also posted a message on Facebook.

She wrote: 'Rest in peace amazing, talented, cocky, funny and beautiful baby, love you always.' 

Mr Brotherston was a keen football player, described as a 'lovely lad' by his Plymouth Falcons team manager.

Falcons manager Alan Potter said: 'Shaun was such a lovely lad, well liked by everyone and a really well respected member of the team.

'He was superb player and quite a few of his friends are on the team - they're absolutely devastated. He was an excellent winger. He will be sadly missed.

'He was out there celebrating his birthday, everyone is deeply shocked.'

Police spokesman Rob van der Veen said the bodies of the two men, both from England, were found next to traces of a white powder in a hotel in Amsterdam (file picture) 

The club's game on Saturday has been postponed and the league is to hold a minute's silence.

Friends have been posting tributes to the pair on social media.

'Absolutely devastated will never be able to see two of my best friends again! Never been in this much pain! RIP to my boys Shaun and Brad, gonna miss you boys, it's not gonna be the same without you,' friend Harry Gould wrote.

Mark Shellem wrote: 'Absolutely devastating news, way too young. Two young men with absolutely beautiful personalities who will be sorely missed by many people. Rest in peace.'

Bethany Jade Jarvis posted: 'RIP to two kind, loving, popular boys. Such a tragic thing to happen.'

Steph Williams wrote: 'Two very loved lads who will always be in everyone's hearts. Gone but most certainly never forgotten. Thoughts are with their families.'

Bradley Parrish added: 'Still can't believe it, thanks for everything man. One of the funniest and down to earth lads I've ever met. RIP Shaun Brotherston. 

The Foreign Office is liaising with Dutch authorities and is 'providing consular assistance to the family', a spokesman said

One British visitor has died and 14 other tourists - mainly from the UK – have been taken ill in recent weeks after snorting white heroin which is being sold as cocaine.

Police spokesman Rob van der Veen said a post-mortem examination is due to be conducted later this week to confirm the time and cause of their deaths.

'We did a quick test to find out what kind of powder it was. It wasn't cocaine, it was an opiate - in this case, white heroin,' Mr van der Veen said.

'We took the sample to the Dutch forensic institute and they found out that the contents of this material is the same contents as other material that we already seized in other cases where people got sick.'

A tourists is interviewed by a local TV station in front of a signs which warns of extremely dangerous cocaine being sold in Amsterdam, Netherlands

He said investigators believe the men were targeted by the same street dealer, or ring of dealers, involved in the death of another Briton last month

Amsterdam police had launched a major public alert targeted at visitors from Britain, many of whom view taking drugs as a big part of the city's attraction, including English-language matrix-style signs reading: 'Extremely dangerous cocaine is sold to tourists.' 

But after no cases for more than a fortnight, the authorities ended the alert at the weekend – meaning the two Britons found dead in their hotel room on Tuesday after apparently snorting the drug may have been unaware of the warning.

Police in the city have now urgently resumed their awareness campaign, putting up posters in hotels and hostels and handing out fliers. 

Leaflets handed out to visitors since last month at main squares and Amsterdam's Centraal railway station warn: 'The last couple of weeks several tourists were hospitalized with severe health problems after using cocaine bought on the street.

'Research has revealed that the cocaine used was not cocaine but white heroin.'

They add that in Amsterdam 'you won't be arrested for taking drugs'.

A UN report named Amsterdam and Antwerp as Europe's top cities for cocaine use based on analysis of urine in sewage, the equivalent to 1.5 grams per day per 1,000 people.
