Photographer to the stars Annie Leibovitz NEVER confirmed a deal to shoot Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's Italian nuptials, it has been revealed.

Rapper Kanye, 37, told how he and his new bride spent the first four days of their honeymoon working on a photo entitled 'The Kiss' to be released on Instagram after Annie allegedly pulled out the day before the wedding.

Speaking at Cannes Lions festival this week, Kim said the couple had wanted their photos to mirror Leibovitz style - even going as far to touch up the 'off color flowers'.  And Kanye even bizarrely claimed: 'She was afraid of celebrity.'

Left in the lurch: Kanye revealed that renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz pulled out of taking the official wedding pictures just one day before the nuptials

Perfect picture: The couple finally released their wedding snap, called the Kiss, four days after their nuptials

However, a source tells
 MailOnline that unbeknownst to Kanye, Annie, 64 - who shot the 
publicity-savvy pair for their Vogue front cover in April - was never 
officially confirmed to shoot the wedding - and the pals are now keen to
 move on.

The
 source, who is close to both Kanye and Annie, said: 'Kanye and Annie’s 
representatives were in negotiations for weeks that were not completed 
by the time of the wedding.'

And
 a spokeswoman for Annie told MailOnline today: 'She would have loved to
 have taken their wedding portrait and was disappointed it didn’t 
happen.'

The
 source added: 'It was Kanye’s dream to bring together for the wedding 
his favorite creatives – Ricardo Tisci on the dress, Vanessa Beecroft on
 the experience, and Andrea Bocelli – Kim’s favorite singer singing 
Kim’s favorite song as she walked down the aisle.

'The first choice to capture one of the most special days in Kim and Kanye’s life: Annie Leibovitz.

'Annie
 wouldn't usually shoot weddings, but Kanye West dreams big. He loves 
and respects Annie as a true artist and wanted to bring her eye for 
beauty to the imagery of the event.

'Annie and Kanye are good, they'll work together again.'

Kanye and Annie Leibovitz then put out a joint statement today, saying: 'Kanye West's comments about Annie Leibovtiz while speaking at the 2014 Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival have been taken out of context and sensationalized.

'Although Kanye expressed frustration that he was not able to collaborate with Annie Leibovitz at his recent wedding, he is not assigning blame, and is not accusing Annie in any way.

'Kim and Annie's representatives were in negotiations for weeks that were not completed by the time of the wedding. Annie would have been happy to do the portrait but she was never confirmed.'

In the end, the wedding photos were taken by 22-year-old British photographer Conor McDonnell from Liverpool.

Stunner: Kim Kardashian, at the MailOnline Boat Party in Cannes, France last night, said that she wanted her wedding photos to mirror Annie Leibowitz' style

In
 his Cannes Lions panel with Steve Stoute, tech guru godfather Ben 
Horowitz and Bloomberg's Stephanie Ruhle,  Kanye was referencing Annie as an example of how to merge 
culture and tech.

Kanye West has revealed it took him and 
new bride Kim Kardashian four days to release their first official 
wedding photo – because they wanted them to look as good as Annie 
Leibovitz’s pictures.The wedding photo is now the most 'liked' photo on Instagram of all time with two million likes.

'Picture
 this,' said Kanye. 'The most-liked Instagram photo of all time, shot by
 Annie Leibowitz. Oh, I’m sorry for dreaming out loud. Again.'

Speaking
 at the Cannes Lions festival on Tuesday, Kanye, revealed the renowned 
American photographer had pulled out of covering his wedding in Italy 
the day before it took place.

However, 
fans had to wait days for the official photograph, called the Kiss, to 
be released. And for the first time, rapper Kanye has revealed why on a 
panel discussion about technology and culture.

He
 said despite the photographer leaving him and Kim in the lurch, he 
wanted his photos look as good as Leibovitz’s because he’s still a 
massive fan of hers.

Kim Kardashian looked stunning as she stepped out in a long-sleeved, Haute Couture Givenchy by Riccardo Tisci wedding dress.The dress, which was was visible in the couple’s first official photo, The Kiss, looked even more sensational in front of the floor-to-ceiling white flower backdrop.And that was no fluke, either. Mr West revealed at the Cannes Lions festival on Tuesday that the floral wall was created specifically to match Mrs Kardashian West's dress.The custom-made, Givenchy creation hugged her curvy frame perfectly, and featured long lace sleeves with strategic sheer panels.

'Thank you @RiccardoTisci17 for making me the most gorgeous gown I've ever seen! I'm so grateful @givenchyofficial for this Givenchy Couture wedding gown!' she tweeted.

Wearing Givenchy proved to be a family affair as both North and Mr West were outfitted by Mr Tisci. North's custom-made, haute couture creation was made to resbemble her mom's dress, while Mr West wore a custom tux.

‘I’ll tell you a little story about the Kiss photo that my girl put up,’ Kanye told a packed audience of hundreds.

Wearing a 
white collarless Acne shirt, jeans ripped at the left knee, and grey 
suede boots, he added: ‘We - and this was p***ing my girl off during the
 honeymoon.

‘She
 was exhausted because we worked on the photo so much because Annie 
Leibovitz pulled out of the wedding, because I think she was scared of 
the idea of celebrity.

‘But
 because Annie pulled out, I was like “I still want my wedding photos to
 look like Annie Leibovitz’s photos” and we sat there and worked on that
 photo for four days – because the flowers were off-colour and stuff 
like that.

‘Can you 
imagine telling someone who wants to just Instagram a photo, who’s the 
number one person on Instagram, “We need to work on the colour of the 
flower wall”, or the idea that it’s a Givenchy dress, and it’s not about
 the name Givenchy, it’s about the talent that is Riccardo Tisci - and 
how important Kim is to the internet. 

‘And
 the fact the number one most-liked photo [on Instagram] has a kind of 
aesthetic was a win for what the mission is, which is raising the 
palette.

‘It was a long time,’ he added – drawing laughs from the audience.

Kim and 
Kanye's wedding photo is the most-liked image to be uploaded to 
Instagram, with more than 1.93 million likes, and more than 35,000 
comments.

Theories: Appearing at a special talk at the Cannes Lions festival, Kanye said he believed Leibovitz was 'scared of the idea of celebrity' which was why she pulled out of taking his wedding photos

The
 discussion, entitled ‘Technology, Culture and Consumer Adoption: 
Learning to Read the Cultural Landscape,’ talked about how digital 
progress and cultural evolution are linked.
