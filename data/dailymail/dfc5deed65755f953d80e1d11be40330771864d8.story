Everton have discovered they are surprisingly popular in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar, where Roberto Martinez is expected to play a number of his big-hitters in the Europa League on Thursday.

Martinez and a travelling squad boasting Romelu Lukaku, Leighton Baines and Tim Howard were pleasantly taken back to find dozens of fans who call themselves Russian Toffees greet them at the local airport after a four-hour flight from Merseyside.

'I saw them all with blue shirts on and thought they had travelled from Liverpool,' said Martinez. 'But they told me “No, we are Russian”. They told me the club has had big support in the country ever since Andrei Kanchelskis played at Goodison.'

To keep up the charm offensive, Everton's Republic of Ireland international Aiden McGeady, who spent three years at Spartak Moscow, then addressed a part of his pre-match media conference in near-fluent Russian, earning a round of applause.

'I was sitting there thinking I couldn't go through the whole thing in English,' smiled McGeady.

'Some of the Everton lads did tell me when we landed “I don't know how you could have played out here” but I enjoyed playing and living here.

'Krasnodar are like a lot of Russian clubs, they have signed quite a few foreign players and are technically quite good. I think it's good for British and Irish players to go away sometimes and experience new things.

'I was 24 when I left Celtic to come here and I don't regret it at all, the only time things went sour came in the last few weeks when I was told to train with the youth team because I didn't want to sign a new contract.'

The long journey facing Everton this week

Russian authorities, hit by a number of scandals ahead of their hosting of the 2018 World Cup, will be glad that Everton are held in high affection given that any repeat of the racial abuse aimed at Manchester City's Yaya Toure by CSKA Moscow fans last season will make unwanted headlines around the world.

On the field of play, Martinez has tapped into McGeady's knowledge of Russian football, and also that of striker Samuel Eto'o, who played briefly for Anzi.

McGeady played with two of Krasnodar's players at Spartak – Brazilian striker Ari and goalkeeper Andriy Dykan.

He revealed: 'The manager has asked me about their strengths and what sort of players they are, but I think he (Martinez) knows all about them anyway – you what he's like when it comes to football!

Everton currently lie 15th in the Premier League having won just one game this season. But their Europa League campaign began with a comprehensive 4-1 victory over Wolfsburg.

Martinez has brought a strong squad for the 4,800-mile round trip unlike manager of some English clubs in the past, including Martin O'Neill who fell out with Aston Villa fans after fielding a weakened team in Moscow.

Those Everton players left behind this week Kevin Mirallas, Steven Pienaar, Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy all have knocks and veteran Sylvain Distin is being rested to avoid any muscular problems.

'Everton have a long history in Europe and we were desperate to qualify,' said Martinez. 'This is our first time in Europe and we want to show what we can do.'

The club haven't faced an away game in Europe since they lost to Sporting Lisbon under David Moyes in 2010 and Martinez is looking at some stage to use the experience of Samuel Eto'o, a Champions League winner with Barcelona and Inter Milan, against opponents who are unbeaten this season and fourth in their domestic league.

'Samuel is more than a player in the dressing-room, he sets the standards for the others,' said Martinez.

The Spaniard, whose glass is always half-full, refuses to blame Europe for the club's current injury list.

Indeed, he thinks all his missing players have a chance of making Sunday's game against Manchester United – except Mirallas who pulled up with a hamstring injury against Liverpool on Satuday.

'He's had a couple of scans but we won't know the true extent of the injury for 48 hours because of the inflammation. But he could be kept out for a while,' said the Everton boss.
