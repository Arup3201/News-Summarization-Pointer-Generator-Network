A cobbled path leading to one of the world’s best-preserved medieval streets is being ripped up and replaced with modern paving after a council said the surface was a hazard to disabled people.

King’s Square, in an ancient part of York, will be entirely repaved in a scheme that is costing taxpayers almost £500,000 and goes against the advice of English Heritage.

City of York Council said the rectangular cobbles - or setts - and other period stonework should be replaced as they 'cause mobility problems for some people.'

A cobbled path leading to the Shambles, one world's best preserved medieval streets, is being ripped up in York as part of a £500,000 re-development

The cobblestone streets of the city are a major tourist attraction and 
widely regarded as one of the best preserved medieval areas in the world

Centuries-old human remains from a former churchyard may also have to be removed so the new paving can be laid.

Conservation experts at English Heritage warned that the existing stonework is an important historic feature of the square, which is lined by timber-framed medieval buildings and other listed structures.

They urged the council not to remove any of the period features, which include old York stone paving worn smooth by generations of feet in the centre of the square and granite wagon tracks that meanders along one side and into the Shambles- widely regarded as one of the best-preserved medieval roads in the world and named Britain’s most picturesque street.

English Heritage emphatically recommended that all existing stonework was kept and restored for sake of preserving the area.

A spokesman said: 'The square is an important part of York’s Conservation Area and the setting of numerous listed buildings.

'In terms of the paving in the area, we gave our view that we would wish to see the retention of all the present York stone and stone cobbled surfaces, along with the granite wheel tracks and kerbstones.'

However it seems their pleas for preservation have fallen on deaf ears as the council plows on with modernisation the period stonework would be replaced with new paving because it could be a hazard.

Lost: Despite an English Heritage recommendation that all existing stonework was kept and restored, the 75 foot cobbled path and other period stonework is being ripped up and replaced with modern paving

Aptly named: The cash-strapped council - which recently announced more than 200 job cuts and a 1.9% increase in council tax - said the work will cost £490,000

A council officer said in a consultation document: 'It is proposed that nearly all of the surfacing of King’s Square will be replaced.

'In this instance it is not practical to extensively re-use existing worn and damaged material, particularly where this surface causes mobility problems for some users.'

The work is being carried out as part of a 'revamp' of King’s Square, which City of York Council said needed a 'radical rethink' in order to make it a 'world-class space.'

When it is paved over it will be used by street performers and, subject to planning permission, could also be used by alfresco diners completely changing the tone of the historic quarter of the city.

The cash-strapped council - which recently announced more than 200 job cuts, big cuts to front-line services and a 1.9% increase in council tax - said the work will cost £490,000.

But Councillor Dave Merrett, Cabinet Member for Planning, Sustainability and Transport, remains convinced they are doing the best for locals and tourists.

He said: 'By transforming King’s Square we are maximising the benefits for residents, visitors and businesses.

'The square needs quite a radical rethink to make it a world-class space and by carrying out this transformation we are going to provide a much better quality public space.'

However, one resident at least was less than impressed.

York is famous for its historic squares and its snickleways - tight alleys between crooked old buildings.

Thousands of visitors flock to the city each year to see one of the best-preserved medieval streets in the world.

The Shambles was named ‘Britain’s most picturesque street’ in the 2010 Google Street View Awards.

King’s Square lies at one end of the 
Shambles, which was a historic butchers’ quarter mentioned in the 
Domesday Book and has changed little since around 1400.

A chapel called Holy Trinity Christ 
Church was at the heart of King’s Square until it was demolished in 
1937.

Although is not clear when the current stonework in King’s Square dates from the earliest known mention of the church dates from 1268.

The cobbled path, which was built in the 
20th century in a style typical of many York lanes, marks the old 
roadway which is visible in photographs from the early 1900s.

Kaitlyn Kernek, 31, said: 'People come from all over the world to see York because it looks like York.

'It’s mad to pull up things that give this beautiful city its character, only to replace them with modern paving that looks like anywhere else.'

Campaign group the TaxPayers’ Alliance said the scheme was a waste of public money and should be scrapped.

A spokesman said: 'Local residents are opposed to this work, as is English Heritage, and you do have to question if the council thinks residents serve them, rather than the other way around.

'The council should scrap this scheme, save taxpayers’ money and help preserve one of York’s historic squares.'

Archeologists have already been called in after workmen carrying out the resurfacing uncovered the foundations of the Victorian and possibly the medieval church.

They said some human remains may need to be moved so the area can be repaved.

Several grave stones dating from the 1700s are currently used as paving slabs and they will be kept, the council added.

English Heritage said the current layout dates from 1937 and much of the stonework itself is probably older, possibly re-used at the time.

However, the council said the layout has changed several times throughout the last 100 years and the current layout is not historically significant enough to be preserved.

Work has already begun on the King’s Square scheme and will take 12 weeks.

The council plans a number of similar projects in other parts of the city centre as part of its Reinvigorate York programme.

Earlier this year, a project to replace 18th century stone setts in the market square in the nearby town of Beverley with modern block paving was scrapped after uproar from residents, historians and English Heritage.

East Riding of Yorkshire Council claimed the setts caused difficulties for disabled people but abandoned the plan just a couple of days before work was due to start in January.
