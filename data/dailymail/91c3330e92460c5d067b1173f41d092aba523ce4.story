Hair of the dog has been long touted as a cure for blistering hangovers, but for one very lucky puppy the headache was well worth it after a two-day vodka binge saved his life.

Maltese terrier Charlie was just hours from certain death after licking coolant, a very sweet product often used in radiator and brake fluids, off a garage floor near Melbourne, Australia.

But thanks to a quick-thinking vet at Animal Accident and Emergency hospital, it was recognised that the puppy had ethylene glycol poisoning.

If untreated, the poisoning can cause kidney failure and death within a day.

Life saving: After it was confirmed Charlie the Maltese terrier had ethylene glycol poisoning, vodka was used to to counteract the effects and save his life

The solution was to get the dog drunk over 48 hours using a bottle of vodka for successive doses to counteract the poising.

As part of the life saving procedure, 700ml of vodka was fed intravenously into Charlie through a tube in his nose through to his stomach.

The alcohol is able to change the chemical reaction, stop kidney failure and ultimately death.

The Herald Sun reported Charlie's owner Jacinta Roseware said she was surprised by the effects the procedure had on her pet.

'He was definitely drunk,' she said. 'He was stumbling around, Iâ€™d go to pat him and heâ€™d push me away like a normal drunk person, he was vomiting a little, whining like a drunk.'

Lucky! After the two-day procedure Charlie made a full recovery to return to full health

'I thought it was hilarious ... It was distressing but funny at the same time.'

But just as it does in humans, Ms Roseware suspects the puppy struggled with an almighty hangover the following day.

'He just slept and slept and slept,' she said. 'I tried to take him for a walk ... but he just sat down after 50 metres ... I had to pick him up and carry him home.'

Hangover: Ms Roseware said Charlie was not his usual self while dealing with the effects of a massive hangover

In an Animal Accident and Emergency blog, a post confirmed Charlie was feeling the effects of being drunk during treatment in the hospital's intensive care unit.

'In fact for the whole weekend, Charlie had a huge party with us in the Pet ICU,' the post said.

'The vodka sedated Charlie and while undergoing therapy, we needed to monitor Charlie.'

The hospital treats two to three cases of ethylene glycol a year, with vodka the easiest form of treatment.

Happy ending: The animal hospital where Charlie was treated said they treat up to three ethylene glycol poisoning a year
