He has already been hailed as Britain’s greatest living artist.

Now a work by David Hockney has been voted as the nation’s favourite painting in a poll of art fans across the UK.

My Parents, painted in 1977 by the Bradford-born artist, depicts Kenneth and Laura Hockney the year before his father died.

Artist David Hockney's tender portrait of his parents has topped a poll as the nation's favourite artwork

'My Parents', painted by Hockney in 1977, depicts his parents just a year before his father Kenneth's death

The painting is one of 25 voted for by 38,000 people on Facebook which will appear on billboards at train stations, bus stops and roadsides across the UK this summer.

The project aims to make art more accessible to the general public, with the works billed as ‘the nation’s favourites’.

The voters were limited to a long-list of 70 works from public galleries which were pre-selected by a panel of curators and art experts.

And some yesterday voiced their surprise at the list, which shunned traditional favourites by Turner and included several unconventional choices.

1. My Parents, David Hockney, 1977

2. Farm at Watendlath, Dora Carrington, 1921

3. Ruby Loftus screwing a Breech-ring, Dame Laura Knight 1943

4. The Annunciation of the Virgin Deal, Grayson Perry, 2012

5. A Fish Sale on a Cornish Beach, Stanhope Alexander Forbes, 1885

6. Melanie and Me Swimming, Michael Andrews, 1978-9

7. Ellen Terry ('Choosing'), George Frederic Watts, 1864

8. The Travelling Companions, Augustus Leopold Egg, 1862

9. Pottery, Patrick Caulfield, 1969

10. Memory Mirror, John Hoyland, 1981

Among the top 25 were Marc Quinn’s 2006 work Self, which is a frozen sculpture of the artist’s head made from 4.5 litres of his own blood.

There was also a photograph of a man holding a sign reading ‘I’m Desperate’ from a series created by conceptual artist Gillian Wearing.

The images to be featured in the Art Everywhere project date back over several centuries, with Hans Holbein the Younger and William Blake also among those to be showcased.

There is also Henry Moore’s sculpture, King and Queen, John Constable’s painting Study of Cirrus Clouds, and the 1984 work Existers, by Gilbert& George.

Turner Prize-winning potter Grayson Perry, whose 2012 work The Annunciation of the Virgin Deal was voted number four, said he was ‘incredibly flattered’ to have made the list.

Unveiling the project at Waterloo station yesterday wearing a pink tartan teddy-themed dress, the cross-dressing artist said it fed into the debate on whether ‘democracy has terrible taste.’

‘From a long list of 70, it’s a great selection,’ he said. ‘It would be interesting to see, if it wasn’t open, what the public would have selected.

‘There would have been so many different choices that you wouldn’t have been able to choose 25 of them. On a practical level that’s my guess.’

Art critic Godfrey Barker added: ‘Maybe the curators have made sure that clichés and the overfamiliar are not on the long-list, and perhaps the public are being forced to choose the less familiar.

The poll results showed 'Farm at Watendlath', by Dora Carrington, was the nation's second most-loved artwork

In third place was 'Ruby Loftus screwing a Breech-ring', by Dame Laura Knight. The artwork depicts a female factory worker operating a lathe during WWII. At the time, it was considered the most skilled job in the factory

Mr Barker added: ‘But ideally, we want the public to see what it doesn’t know about, rather than voting for whatever it knows.

‘It’s a magnificent chance to widen people’s experience of art.’

More than 30,000 billboards and outdoor sites across the UK will display the selection of works over the coming weeks.

They will include bus shelters, digital poster screens and within more than 2,000 black cabs during the exhibition from July 21 to August 31.

Grayson Perry's 2012 artwork 'The Annunciation of the Virgin Deal' was voted fourth in the poll

Sir Antony Gormley, creator of the Angel of the North, has created a specially-commissioned digital artwork for the project, which can be downloaded free of charge.

He said yesterday: ‘Art is about sharing. This extraordinary project is about art being everywhere in order to reinforce the fact that art is everyone’s.’

The project, run by the Art Fund, Tate and a collaboration of other organisations, launched last year for the first time, when 30,000 people voted.

The top two favourites of 2013 were John William Waterhouse’s The Lady of Shalott and John Everett Millais’s Ophelia, which both hang in Tate Britain.

Organisers said the judging panel selected an entirely different long-list this year, to avoid replicating last year’s results.
