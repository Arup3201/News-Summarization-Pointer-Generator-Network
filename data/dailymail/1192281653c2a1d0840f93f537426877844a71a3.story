ADRIAN DURHAM: Jack Colback is the most underrated player in the Premier League... Sunderland fans should thank him and move on

ADRIAN DURHAM: Is Roy Hodgson the new Fabio Capello? England will suffer if they keep it tight with Italy... he must be brave, as he promised

ADRIAN DURHAM: England must be adventurous and take the World Cup by storm or go out in glory... my starting XI for the opener with Italy

Playing football on the light, golden sand of the Copacabana in 30 degrees of burning sunshine is a good, good feeling. And as I made my way off the beach back to my apartment, the reality of what is about to start sunk in.

A sweaty drive through the heavy traffic takes you to the Maracana, where the World Cup final will be staged next month.

This is where legends and heroes will be created in the next few weeks.

It’s not just the final that makes the player’s name, although that is the ultimate moment to do be either hero – ask Sir Geoff Hurst; villain – Roberto Baggio knows that feeling; or both – ladies and gentlemen, I give you Zinedine Zidane, the only man to win and lose different World Cup finals single-handedly.

Club success is brilliant, but when it comes to being remembered, it’s history made on a micro level.

Biggest stage: Rooney and Gerrard in training for England... and this could be their last chance to shine

Next step: Can they elevate themselves from great club players, to true star status?

To hit the globe hard enough to stay in people’s consciousness you have to do it at the World Cup. Nowhere else can give you that level of legendary status.

What do most people think of when they hear the name Diego Maradona? Hand of God of course. Johan Cruyff? The Cruyff Turn. Bobby Moore? That tackle on Pele in 1970.

Gordon Banks? That save from Pele in 1970. Marco Tardelli? The best celebration ever. Michael Owen? That phenomenal goal in 1998 in St Etienne. The list goes on and on.

World famous: England winning the World Cup in 1966, Geoff Hurst and the Three Lions' defining moment

Hero and villain: Zidane scored twice in the 1998 final, but was sent off for a headbutt in 2006 in against Italy

It’s all about the World Cup. Liverpool fans will remember Suarez’s 31 goals for them this season, but the rest of the world knows Suarez as the villain against Ghana in Johannesburg in 2010.

Andres Iniesta’s most memorable feat is scoring the winning goal in a World Cup final, not being part of the great Barcelona team that included Messi and Xavi.

So all 736 players converging on Brazil this week for the World Cup know that this is the chance to make an indelible mark on football history.

Aside: Suarez (front) scored 31 goals for Liverpool last season... but most will remember him for something else

Cheat? Suarez handball in 2010 prevented a goal, before Ghana missed the resulting penalty

And that includes the England squad. This is the moment where they can do something that means they will be remembered forever. For Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard, it’s a last chance probably.

Can any of them take it? Can they elevate themselves from great club players, to true star status at a World Cup? Can they create history and earn themselves a chapter in the book of World Cup history? Will they seize the moment to earn the right to be mentioned in the same breath as Pele?

There are some fans, especially in England, who will tell you international football is dying.

Utter garbage.

A true test: Johan Cruyff performed on the biggest stage, not just at club level

The biggest stage: Maradona's 'Hand of God' against England in the 1986 World Cup

Despite FIFA’s spectacularly terrible way of running the game, the World Cup remains the biggest sporting event on the planet, bigger even than the Olympics.

Whether England are good or bad, when they get to a tournament they are always bigger than any club side around.

Brazil is a place for legends – let’s see if Roy Hodgson and these England players can make themselves true legends, not just club legends.

Can Rooney and Gerrard step up on what could be their last chance on the biggest stage?

The World Cup is far beyond any other footballing platform

@highlight

Ask Johan Cruyff, Maradona, Zinedine Zidane, Pele, Geoff Hurst and Co

Luis Suarez will be remembered by Liverpool fans for his goals, but by fans across the world for his handball against Ghana in 2010
