Baby girl: Sunny labored for four hours before delivering daughter Indy Rae in a water birth. This is Johnston's third child and the second with Sunny. The couple were married in october 2012 - one month after the birth of their first daughter Breeze 

Johnston became a household name around the country in 2008 when his girlfriend's mother, then Alaska Governor Sarah Palin, was named as the vice presidential candidate in John McCain's failed run at the White House. 

Bristol was already pregnant at the time when her mother was chosen. At the Republican National Convention where she was announced as McCain's running mate, Johnston showed up with the entire family as Bristol's new fiancé. 

The couple's son Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston was born in December 2008, after McCain and Palin lost the race.

Out of the spotlight, the couple decided to break up just a few months later in March 2009 and started an intense custody battle. 

However, in the midst of the battle, they also briefly reunited and got engaged again. The engagement was short lived when they broke up for a second time in the summer of 2010.

Johnston has been married to Sunny since October 2012. They have one other child together, daughter Breeze Beretta (named after is favorite gun), who was born one month before they tied the knot.
