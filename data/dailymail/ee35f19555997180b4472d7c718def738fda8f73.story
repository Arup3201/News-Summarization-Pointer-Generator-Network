A dramatic chase along a California highway ended when a driver's SUV crashed into the median and flipped over after it had lost two tires.

Ramon Bernal, 24, of Davis, led authorities more than 100 miles around the Bay Area in a gold 1999 Nissan Pathfinder.

It is not yet known why Bernal decided to flee from authorities, who had been trying to pull him over in Vacaville around 2pm on Tuesday.

The chase started in Vacaville, in the north of California's Bay Area, and stretched about 100 miles south, to Los Altos

Bernal, who was alone in the car, was arrested for felony evasion and driving under the influence of drugs.

He reached speeds of more than 90 miles per hour during the hour-long chase, which included stints on three highways and four counties, according to ABC7.

The driver maneuvered around other vehicles, none of whom were hit, even after losing his front left tire and driving on the SUV's rims for miles.

The Pathfinder finally span out of control and ran into a median near Los Altos, about forty miles south of San Francisco.
