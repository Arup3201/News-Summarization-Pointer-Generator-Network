If any of you guys watch Made In Chelsea, you'll know I've got an exciting adventure on the horizon. I'm heading off to stateside for a couple of months - we're taking MiC to NYC, so watch out America!

A bunch of my best buddies from the show are coming along (and, yes, some of my not-so-favourite friends, too).

It's going to be an amazing trip, but I'm such a homegirl that I know I'll miss the mates I've left behind. So me and my girl gang have booked a last-minute weekend away. We're heading off to the countryside for two days of pampering, gossip and giggles.

I've gathered up my perfect weekend 
beauty kit. I'm not taking tons of lotions and potions - just my 
favourite selection of tried-and-tested travel products that keep me 
gorgeous on the go.

This week Binky tells you exactly what you should pop in your make-up bag for a weekend away

BINKY'S MINI-BREAK ESSENTIALS

Tisserand - Travel Survival Kit

I'm a great believer in the power of aromatherapy. Essential oils can work wonders, calming your nerves, boosting your energy after a long journey or soothing you off to sleep.

This triple-pack of roll-on oils is a travel must-have for me - especially Sweet Dreams: a quick dab on my pulse points and I'm straight off to the land of nod.

Philip Kingsley - Jet Set Soft and Shiny Pack

I give my hair a pretty hard time - constant styling, over-heating and extensions can leave my crowning glory looking less than glorious.

This twin pack of products is the perfect solution. Together, the shampoo and conditioner will condition and nourish your hair, improving and maintaining its health to give it a renewed shine and bounce.

Binky recommends a little aromatherapy after a long day traveling and some high quality hair repair for damaged locks

Batiste - Dry Shampoo

This is a Binky must-have. I'm always on the go and I don't always have time for a wash and blow dry, so if my locks begin to look limp over the weekend, I'll spritz in this miracle-worker and my hair will be transformed from flat and greasy to bouncy and gorgeous in seconds.

Halo - Eye Make Up Remover Pads

I plan on really looking after my complexion this weekend, and that means thoroughly removing every last scrap of make-up each night. That said, I don't want to bring loads of lotions and potions away with me. Luckily, these brilliant cleansing pads swipe away all traces of eye make-up (including troublesome mascara) in a flash. 

Halo's eye make-up remover pads are very handy for light packing and Binky's nail polish adds a great pop of colour to a weekend look

Binky London - Gel Effect Nail Polish in Chelsea Coral

OK - I know this is one of my nail products so I'm bound to be biased, but it looks so amazing, I've been wearing non-stop recently. It's made with a high-end gel base that utilises the best in nail lacquer technology, giving you fabulously glossy results. Like all the Binky London products, it's also free from chemical nasties such as Dibutyl Phthalate, Toluene and Formaldehyde, so your nails will be both beautiful and healthy too.

L'Occitane - Shea Butter Hand Cream

What's the point in having beautiful nails if your hands look dry and dreadful?! This award-winning hand cream really deserves it's reputation as an iconic skin saver. Its super-smoothing 20% concentration of shea butter cocoons hands in moisture, while antioxidant Vitamin E ensures your skin is protected from ageing free radicals. It smells yummy too!

Binky loves the fresh summery fragrance of Marc Jacob's Daisy- Eu So Fresh and says L'Occitane's hand cream is a skin savior

Marc Jacobs - Daisy Eau so Fresh Delight Eau de Toilette Spray

A summer getaway calls for a fresh summery fragrance, and the don't come any lovelier than this one. It's vibrant fruity mix of blood orange, raspberry, apricot and amber lifts your spirits and leaves you smelling good enough to eat.

Skinbreeze – Under Eye Brightener

I always reach for this serum to pick me up when I’ve had a bit of a late night – it works wonders in reducing puffiness and dark circles around the eyes. A must have if you plan on partying over the weekend!

As always, I've tested every product I mention, and you can pick up my recommendations at online beauty boutique escentual.com.

Binky says that the Vashi diamond pieces will look great against tanned summer skin

On a more luxurious note, I recently got some gorgeous diamond jewellery from Vashi.com on the recommendation of my friend Vashi Dominguez, This Morning’s resident diamond expert. The glitzy Diamond Star Pendant will be adorning my neck on many a night out this summer, while the Diamond and Pink Sapphire Ring in 9-carat White Gold will look stunning against tanned fingers - a real timeless piece.

Visit Vashi.com if you’re after a touch of luxe but don't want to spend a fortune, as a lot of the pieces are surprisingly affordable given their quality. Diamonds are, after all, a girl's best friend...

Got to rush - my bags are packed, the taxi's outside and the girls are waiting. So have a great bank holiday - I know I will! And always stay gorgeous!

Love Binky!
