A woman accused of arranging the murder of her Australian businessman husband in Bali could face charges carrying the death penalty.

The development in the case comes as the couple's Perth-based sons arrive in Bali to mourn their father, Robert Kelvin Ellis. 

The body of the 60 years old was found wrapped in plastic and dumped in a ditch in the rice field near Sedang Village on Tuesday. 

He was set upon in his own Bali kitchen by five killers who slashed his throat 'like killing a pig', police say.

Police will allege Noor Ellis paid Arli (also known as Adrianus Ngongo or Ariel pictured), the boyfriend of her maid known as 'F', $14,000 to kill Mr Ellis, most of it to be paid after the crime.

His wife of around 20 years, Indonesian Julaikah Noor Aini, known as Noor Ellis, is accused of ordering the crime while furious over money and infidelity.

'The motive is because his wife felt embittered with the victim,' Badung police chief Komang Suartana told News Corp.

'Because of many things. She said that her husband is often cheating on her.' 

Police will allege she paid Arli (also known as Adrianus Ngongo or Ariel), the boyfriend of her maid known as 'F', $14,000 to kill Mr Ellis, most of it to be paid after the crime.

Police spokesman Hery Wiyanto says the wife, Arli, 'F' and a second maid known as 'Y' will be charged.

F is accused of 'lifting and dumping' Mr Ellis' body, while Y apparently cleaned up the bloody kitchen.

Mr Hery said two charges were being weighed - murder, carrying up to 15 years jail, and premeditated murder - which carries a maximum penalty of death.

Officials said Mr Ellis, who has been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife

Four others were still wanted for assisting Arli, he said.

'Some have fled out of Bali and some are still hiding in Bali,' he said.

'We urge them to surrender. Wherever they are, we will hunt them down.'

The couple's sons Jon and Peter Ellis, both Perth-based students, arrived in Bali on Thursday.

They released a statement on Wednesday saying their father was a huge influence in their lives.

They were 'completely devastated' by his death, they said.

'The circumstances surrounding the death of our father is something we are still trying to come to terms with at this moment.'

'We are fortunately surrounded by friends and family.'

'We do ask for people to understand our need for privacy at this extremely difficult and sad time for us.'

Police say the roles each of the accused played in the crime are still being established, with another re-enactment to be staged for investigators on Friday. 

Officials confirmed that Mr Ellis, who had been living in Australia, had a UK passport, and is believed to have moved to the seaside area of Sanur, Bali with his wife. 

A friend told Fairfax Media that Mr Ellis spent a lot of his time in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, where he had an apartment.

'He used to go up there every week and was rooting every girl that runs around town,' the friend  told Fairfax.

Although Mr Ellis's wife has reportedly confessed to ordering her husband's murder, he is said to have angered contractors who were building a motel for him in the Bali beach side town of Sanur, claiming they were not doing a good job.

He was accused by the friend of being very tight with money.

Bali police said Mr Ellis' was found with his hands and feet tied, and a bed cover had been put over his body.

'There is no doubt this was an execution-style murder,' said a senior police officer in the Bali capital, Denpasar.

Mr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, who heads the district's forensic team, said Mr Ellis' throat had been slashed three times. 

The body Mr Ellis, 60, was found in a rice field on Tuesday morning local time by residents

'One of the wounds to the throat was fatal, but he also had several bruises around his head, suggesting he had been knocked to the ground before receiving the fatal throat wound,' said Mr Putu.

A mobile phone and a large mat was found in close proximity to the body, local authorities said. 

Detective Wisnu Wardana said the body is believed to have been lying in the ditch for several days as it was in a state of decay.

The rice paddy where the body was found lies between the popular coastal area of Kuta and the hillside town of Ubud.

'There was a deep wound to the neck that had almost completely cut the head,' said Detective Wisnu. 

Police believe the mat found in the ditch was used to wrap the body and carry it to the rice paddy to be dumped.

It is understood Mr Ellis went missing in the early hours of last Sunday morning.

There were bruises around his mouth and his right cheek, as well as on both his upper arms, suggesting he had been restrained.

It is understood that Mr Ellis and his wife had been living in the Emerald Villas, a luxury complex in the Balinese seaside district of Sanur.

Although the villas are for rent by holidaymakers, local media said that Mr Ellis and his wife were believed to have purchased one of the villas.
