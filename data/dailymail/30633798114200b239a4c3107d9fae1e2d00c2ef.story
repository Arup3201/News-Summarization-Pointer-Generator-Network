Russia's richest and most powerful female oligarch is suing an oil tycoon with a pop star wife after he allegedly conned her out of £80 million.

Elena Baturina, who lives in Holland Park, west London, says oil and gas magnate Alexander Chistyakov ripped her off over an investment.

Mr Chistyokov, 41, who is married to Russian chart-topper GluKosa, 28, denies any wrongdoing and has accused Ms Baturina of breaching the agreement between them.

The dispute is over an investment she made through one of her companies towards a proposed multi-million-pound luxury property development in Morocco in 2008. 

Ms Baturina, who is married to former mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, is the only Russian woman to have amassed a nine-figure personal fortune.

The 51-year-old moved to the UK three years ago because of 'political difficulties' says there are good reasons why she does not feel able to return to her homeland. 

Now she is asking Appeal Court judges, Lords Justice Rimer, Lewison and Christopher Clarke, to rule that her dispute with Mr Chistyakov ought to be decided in an English court.

Ms Baturina, whose two daughters, Elena and Olga, attended University College London, made her fortune in cement and construction during the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union.

She is well known as an art collector and is the patron of several creative charities.

She claims that Mr Chistyakov, 41, chairman of an oil and gas company, 'induced' her into signing away almost £80million, which has now disappeared.

Ms Baturina is now trying to force Mr Chistyakov - who caused a sensation in Russia by marrying GluKosa, a pop starlet 13 years his junior - to repay the money and wants her claim against him heard in England.

Summarizing her case during a hearing last year, Mr Justice Walker said she claims 'that Mr Chistyakov made fraudulent representations to her which led to her signature of the agreement and to her participation in the joint venture.'

However, Mr Chistyakov 'alleges that Ms Baturina's representatives caused him substantial personal loss' and that she 'failed fully to invest in the projects, thereby breaching the principal agreement.'

The judge dealt Ms Baturina a serious blow when he ruled she would have to pursue her claim against Mr Chistyakov in Russia.

Challenging that decision, Barbara Dohmann QC, for Ms Baturina, told the Appeal Court: 'The fundamental issue will be, to put the issue at its most straighforward, what happened to the £80m?

'It is Ms Baturina's case that she trusted Mr Chistyakov and that considerable sums went out... she invested nearly 100 million euros in the projects through funds advanced by a company of which she was then the sole owner.

'Ms Baturina's claim is that, in breach of the principal agreement, the bulk of the funds which she had provided were not invested in the projects, but were wrongfully dissipated by Mr Chistyakov through a series of international companies.'

Insisting the case should be heard by an English judge, the QC added: 'It is apparent that the shape of the case has very little to do with Russia.'

She told the court that there had been an agreement between Ms Baturina and Mr Chistyakov that any disputes would be settled under English law, though it was not specified which country would host any hearing.

She added: 'Ms Baturina lives in England. Mr Chistyakov has important business interests in England.

'He was served with the proceedings in England in March 2013. There is not a great deal of Russian evidence. We would suggest there is a heavy weight of witnesses on the non-Russian side.'

However, Stephen Moverley Smith QC, for Mr Chistyakov, insisted that Russia was the right forum for the case to be fought out. At the time of the deal, the parties were all living in Russia.

'The parties are Russian nationals. Mr Chistyakov resided in and carried on business in Russia. Until 2011 Ms Baturina resided in and carried on business in Russia. Any damage was suffered in Russia,' he told the judges.

Ms Baturina says that she and her daughters moved to London after she and her husband were criticised on Russian state television following his dismissal  in 2010.

She had retained part ownership of a 10-room Moscow apartment but said she 'did not feel able to return to Russia at present'.

In his ruling last year, Mr Justice Walker accepted that she had 'a real anxiety' at the prospect of going back to Russia.

But he went on to decide that it was 'clearly and distinctly more appropriate' for her dispute with Mr Chistyakov to be dealt with by a Russian court.

The Court of Appeal has now reserved its judgement on Ms Baturina's appeal until a later date.
