Police are searching for car-jackers who threatened a motorist with a meat cleaver before stealing his vehicle.

Officers said the thuggish duo threw a bottle at a moving car in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

The VW Polo stopped and the 19-year-old driver and his passenger were approached by two men.

Well-dressed car jackers approached the VW Polo before threatening the driver with a meat cleaver and fleeing in his vehicle

One of them swung a meat cleaver at him, catching his clothing and another man threw a brick at the rear car window, smashing it

One of them, dressed in a shirt and smart jumper, swung a meat cleaver at the driver while the other threw a brick at the rear car window, smashing it.

Officers said the driver was then dragged out of the car and his passenger was assaulted before the men got in the Polo and drove off.

The cleaver-wielding men abandoned a short time later and fled

The vehicle was abandoned soon after and both men ran off along Tonge Moor Road.

One man is described as being dark skinned, 6ft tall, well built, in his late teens or early 20s and had short light brown hair.

He wore a grey hooded top and dark-coloured jeans.

The other was slim and was wearing a white shirt and dark-coloured jumper.

Police have issued CCTV images of two men following the incident.

Detective Constable Dave Harris said: 'The offenders showed extreme aggression towards their victims and they are lucky they did not suffer more serious injuries.

'Understandably, both have been left shaken after this attack.

'We believe this was a random attack and I would ask members of the community to be vigilant.

'We are unsure why the Polo was abandoned a short time later and we are asking for witnesses to come forward.

'The two images we have are very clear and I believe that someone within the local community will recognise them.

'If you do, we are keen to speak to you.'
