A teacher who was controversially sacked after she wrote a racy novel inspired by her students has won a three-year battle to clear her name.

Mum-of-one Leonora Rustamova, 41, known to pupils as Miss Rusty, was sacked after her book - which made sexual references and drew comparisons between teenagers and 'gorgeous Mr Gay UK finalists' - was published online and attracted nationwide attention.

She said the book, Stop! Don't Read This, was written to encourage literacy among Year 11 pupils - but the head and governors of Calder High School in Mytholmroyd, West Yorkshire, were less than impressed and fired the teacher in 2009.

Miss Rusty, who had been at the school for 11 years, is now celebrating  after being cleared by of any misdemeanours by the General Teaching Council (GTC) - which she hopes will help her win an industrial tribunal.

She said: 'It has been an awful time. I got the letter from the General Teaching Council on Saturday and it took 15 minutes to summon up the courage to open the envelope.

'The council said it had re-examined all the facts in the case and decided there was no case to answer, so they are taking it no further.

Stop! Don't Read This contains many sexual references and makes light of the pupils’ bad behaviour.

One pupil is described as flirting with Miss Rusty, while she says she would do anything for a smile from another.

Miss Rusty's character says: ‘It’s getting harder and harder to see them just as kids.’

Two characters, who are sunbathing topless, are described as ‘looking like gorgeous Mr Gay UK finalists in an area of Britain where there is some pretty stiff competition’.

Later in the novel she describes how pupils practise ‘orgasmic moans’ to entertain themselves. These are described as sounding like ‘the soundtrack to teenage gay porn’.

The book ends with the boys being labelled heroes after revealing a drugs store beneath the school and reporting it to police – but not before a case of cocaine goes missing.

Miss Rusty says: ‘I suppose the boys had earned a hell of a ritzy summer holiday.’

'It had been referred to them as a matter of course when I was sacked, supposedly for a serious disciplinary breach.

'This
has been hanging over me for three years and stopped me doing the job I
loved. I never wanted to do anything else but teach.

'I loved every minute of my career, working with young people.

'It has been a dreadful time but now I feel so relieved and there have been great celebrations in the Rustamova household all weekend.

'I still love teaching and who knows, I may well go back. But I have concerns over the problems in state schools, where there is too much power invested in the head and the governors.

'This thing has set me on a new course and I have two great jobs, working with adult education students in Leeds and with students at the University of Huddersfield.

'Now I hope that the Teaching Council ruling will help me in my fight with the Employment Tribunal.

'I won an appeal against their findings and I hope when the next hearing comes along they will consider the Teaching Council verdict.'

Governors accused Miss Rustamova - who was on a salary of £34,000 - of bringing the school into disrepute, undermining its authority and demeaning pupils and parents.

An appeal against her dismissal was rejected, despite considerable support from colleagues, pupils and parents.

As a result of her ordeal, Miss Rustamova's marriage collapsed.

She claimed the book, which was peppered with expletives, was an innovative way of getting her pupils interested in their work.

It named several teachers and featured five year 11 pupils - all real students and referred to as Miss Rusty's favourites.

The book was finally published in paperback last summer by Bluemoose Books, based in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire.
