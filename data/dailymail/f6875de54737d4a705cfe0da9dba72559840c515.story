At the age of just 20, Hannah Cockroft is a multiple world record holder, double paralympic gold medallist and an MBE thanks to her talent for wheelchair racing.

But while no-one can doubt her sporting prowess, Hannah, who has cerebral palsy, said she often meets people who assume she's stupid because she's in a wheelchair.

'Some people pat you on head or treat like dog and can be patronising,' she told the MailOnline. 'But just 
because your legs don't work, it doesn't mean your brain doesn't work.

'I 
can laugh that kind of thing off but for others it can be degrading and 
upsetting, we just want to be seen as another member of society. 
Disabled people can be just as intellectual and clever as anyone else.'

Hannah,
from Halifax, said there has been great strides in improving people's 
perceptions of those with disabilities thanks to the London 2012 
Paralympics.

She said: 'After Beijing Paralympians had attention for two weeks and then everyone forgot 
about us for four years. But after London everything is still going on 
six months down the line. It's like we're being given a chance now. 
Perceptions have changed. You still get one or two people that are like,
"look at her she's a wheelchair, what can she do" but most people are positive.'

Changed her life: The charity Whizz-Kidz gave Hannah her first sports wheelchair when she was 15

Hannah is supporting the children's 
charity Whizz-Kidz's manifesto 'Generation Inspired?' that aims to build
on this positive platform and continue raising awareness of those with 
disabilities.

The manifesto contains the hopes and opinions of young 
disabled people gathered in the months following the 2012 Paralympics, with their 
recommendations for embedding the Games’ ethos and inclusivity into 
everyday services. Hannah personally delivered the report to Downing Street today for the Government to consider. 

Whizz-Kidz gave Hannah her first 
sports wheelchair at the age of 15 which she said completely 
transformed her life - not only because it set her on a path to become a
world champion but because it gave her more day-to-day freedom.

'The NHS are brilliant at providing wheelchairs but it's not always a good
fit,' she explained. 'Whizz-Kidz provide chairs that fit perfectly giving people the 
chance to get out and be independent.

'For me, getting a sports wheelchair gave me 
independence so I could go out with my friends more and I could play sports like wheelchair basketball.

'It
opened a lot of doors so I could go out and not have to rely on someone 
else pushing me and not find things like getting up kerbs so difficult.'

Making a difference: Hannah and friends visited Downing Street today to deliver the charity's manifesto calling for a brighter future for disabled people

Sports wheelchairs have cambered wheels, sleeker tyres and are sturdier than the average day wheelchair - but also more expensive.

There are an estimated 70,000 disabled children and young people in the UK waiting for a wheelchair that fits their young lives and it's these youngsters that Whizz-Kidz are trying to help.

Hannah admits her life would have been completely different had she not received her wheelchair from the charity.

'Wheelchairs, particular sports ones, cost so much and that's the barrier stopping a lot of children being more independent or playing sport,' she said.

Hannah played wheelchair basketball before taking up wheelchair racing. She's had a short but successful career so far winning the World Champs 100m and 200m titles in the T34 category in 2011 and then repeating this feat in front of a home crowd at the London Paralympics. She's now training to defend her world titles in Leon this year and looking forward to Rio 2016.

Hannah is delighted that her achievements, and those of Paralympians such as David Weir, Richard Whitehead and Jonnie Peacock are now inspiring young people to get into sport, in the same way she was inspired by Tanni Grey-Thompson in her youth.

But a Whizz-Kidz poll found that 'enthusiasm to get active is tempered by a lack of opportunity. More than two thirds of parents surveyed said their children’s schools don’t play any of the Paralympic sports.'

The charity's report adds: 'While children may want to take up Boccia, wheelchair basketball, archery, wheelchair tennis and other Paralympic sports, opportunities to do so at school are limited. Our young people suggested mainstream schools and local clubs should work together to share facilities and equipment.'

The charity manifesto adds that while it's fantastic children now have so many sporting role models, they also want disabled people to be more visible in other areas such as in media roles like TV presenting, in fashion, the arts and politics.

Legacy: The manifesto aims to build on the success of the London 2012 Paralympics

While some progress has been made in wheelchair access on public transport, they would also like more to be done in this area.

Hannah explains: 'We should be able to get on a train like 
everyone but if you're in a wheelchair you have to phone ahead before your journey to make sure there are ramps.

I've had loads of problems over the years on public transport. I start to feel like a 
pain asking for ramps all the time and sometimes I get forgotten and miss my stop as I'm left on the carriage.

'Buses often only have 
one space for wheelchairs so if I'm going out with a friend who is also in a wheelchair we have to get different buses.'

Whizz-Kidz chief executive Ruth Owen said the charity hopes improvements can continue to be made in the coming years.

'The London Paralympics shone a spotlight on the talent, skill and ambition of disabled people. However it will be a hugely missed opportunity if we don’t capitalise on the legacy of the Games - and not just to create more access to sport, but to offer greater opportunity for young disabled people across all areas of society,' she said.

'The young wheelchair users we speak to tell us they face invisible and visible barriers every day. It’s essential to keep on challenging these and make an enduring difference.'
