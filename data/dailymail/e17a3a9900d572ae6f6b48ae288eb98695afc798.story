A ‘quantum leap’ has been made in encryption technology that could help securely transfer sensitive data.

The technology - known as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) – delivers private data using the smallest possible packets of light.

Data could include encrypted personal information, such as patient health records between hospitals, or payments between credit card providers and online retailers.

'Quantum' is defined as the minimum amount of a physical
entity.

A photon is a quantum, for example, as it is the smallest
divisible unit of light: a single light particle.

Quantum mechanics, also known as quantum physics, describes
the behaviour of small particles, including photons, as well as atoms, ions and
electrons.

The behaviour of these particles can seem counter-intuitive
and often goes against the rules of classical physical systems.

One of the fundamental principles of quantum systems is that
they can behave like both particles and waves. Light is commonly referred to
as, and treated like, a wave, but it consists of particles: photons.

This type of behaviour, known as wave-particle duality,
gives rise to the strange properties that make the prospect of future quantum
technologies exciting in areas such as communication, timing, navigation and
information security and storage.

 In theory, quantum
computing could allow for huge amounts of data to be processed, which is even
beyond today's supercomputers, as well as entirely new types of computation.

‘Encrypted data is very secure,’ Alastair
 Sinclair from the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) told MailOnline.  
‘Its main vulnerability comes from people working out or intercepting 
the key which allows it to be unencrypted.’

‘QKD ensures that the key is transmitted securely. First the key is created and then data scientists can encrypt the data to send it from one party to the other.’

QKD shares a key between two users that is made completely secure using quantum mechanics.

It provides an additional layer of security over and above standard methods used by banks and credit card companies to send data encryption ‘keys’ across a network.

It works because binary data is encoded into the particles of light. The 'phase' – a property of photons – is altered to represent binary data: a 0 or 1. 

‘The 
transmitter can encode these photons in two different ways – known as 
bases - creating four possible combinations,’ said Mr Sinclair.

The photons are randomly encoded, creating a random key and sent at precise time intervals to the receiver.

The receiver detects the photons as 0s and 1s but not which base. So it randomly chooses which base it will detect and records the values and bases.

Once all the information has been received, the receiver tells the transmitter which bases it detected and the transmitter reveals which were right and wrong.

The receiver rejects all wrong detection events – leaving just the correct ones.

Armed with this information, it can create the key to first encrypt and subsequently decrypt and unlock the data.

‘The system is secure because it enables eavesdroppers on the line to be detected,’ said Mr Sinclair.

‘Any attempt to monitor the data will interfere with the photons, affecting the encoding. If there is interference, the receiver will terminate the process before the key is produced.’

A consortium of companies, including BT, Toshiba and NPL, recently completed the first successful trial of QKD over a live fibre network.

The field trial shows quantum encryption of 40 Gb/s of data on a live optical fibre.  Although these are just tests, the data could include phone calls, personal email, bank details and health records.

The trial, which is supported by the UK’s innovation agency, the Technology Strategy Board, is the first to use a single ‘lit’ fibre – which is fibre to transmit data and the quantum key itself.  

The use of a single fibre is significant, as both the quantum ‘key’ and the encrypted data can now use the same pathway for the first time.

‘The laws of Quantum Mechanics dictate that eavesdropper wouldn’t be able to detect the key without fundamentally changing it, so anything untoward can be easily detected,’ Andrew Lord, head of optical research at BT told MailOnline.

Early days: Although the technology has only been tested so far, it could one day be used for phone calls, personal email, bank details and health records (illustrated)

‘But if they want somebody to un-encrypt that data at the other end, then obviously they have to send the key too.’

‘That’s what makes QKD a potentially very secure way of transmitting keys.’

The technology can be used to protect any data being carried by an optical communications system.

‘Any organisation could use it to secure their telephony and video links, whilst businesses could use it to transmit commercially sensitive data,’ said Mr Lord

Researchers, however, are reluctant to put a time-scale on when the technology could be available for wider use.

‘This research is helping us to understand that, and it’s very promising,’ said Mr Lord.

‘We have begun to test an advanced prototype with this trial and we’ll be looking at the possibility of further trials in the future.’

A key is created so that data can be encrypted and sent from one party to the other.

Then the key to unlock that data is transmitted securely using Quantum Key Distribution (QKD).

Binary data is encoded into tiny light particles called photons. The 'phase' – a property of photons – is altered to represent binary data: a 0 or 1.

The transmitter can encode these photons in two different ways – known as bases - creating four possible combinations.

The photons are randomly encoded to create a random key and sent at precise time intervals to the receiver.

The receiver detects the photons. It can detect 0s and 1s but not which base, so it randomly chooses which base it will detect and records the values and bases.

Once all the information has been received, the receiver tells the transmitter which bases it detected and the transmitter reveals which were right and wrong. The receiver rejects all wrong detection events – leaving just the correct ones.

Armed with this information, it can create the key to first encrypt and subsequently decrypt or unlock the data.

The system is secure because it enables eavesdroppers on the line to be detected. Any attempt to monitor the data will interfere with the photons, affecting the encoding. If there is interference, the receiver will terminate the process before the key is produced.

Any attempt to monitor or interfere with the transmitted key while it’s being sent will be detectable.
