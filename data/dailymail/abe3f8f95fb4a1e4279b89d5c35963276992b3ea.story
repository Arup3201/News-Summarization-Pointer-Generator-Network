A woman charged with murdering a man she met off Craigslist with the help of her newlywed husband made up the claim that she killed more than 20 people and is drawing on the escapades of television serial killer 'Dexter,' according to her sister said.

Miranda Barbour is 'a master at lying,' sister Ashley Dean told The Daily Item newspaper of Sunbury, Pennsylvania.

'She takes a lot of truths and puts the lie in the middle so when people talk to her they see all these truths and then they believe the lie,' Dean told the newspaper.

Hearing her out: Miranda, 19, has pleaded not guilty saying that she felt forced to kill as a result of a Satanic cult

Dean said she hasn't spoken to her sister since Barbour was arrested December 3.

 When she heard her sister had been arrested, she assumed it was for drugs because her sister had a drug problem.

The 19-year-old Barbour was in Northumberland County court on Tuesday morning for a pretrial hearing.

Barbour is awaiting trial on charges she killed a man she allegedly lured through a Craigslist ad offering companionship for money. She and her husband, Elytte Barbour, have pleaded not guilty.

Investigators allege the young woman stabbed 42-year-old Troy LaFerrara about 20 times in her parked car as Elytte Barbour held a cord tight against LaFerrara's neck from the back seat and then dumped his body in an alley.

In a jailhouse interview with The Daily Item, Barbour admitted to LaFerrara's slaying and said she had killed at least 22 other people from Alaska to North Carolina in the last six years as part of her involvement in a satanic cult.

She told the newspaper that she targeted people 'who did bad things and didn't deserve to be here anymore.' 

Investigators say they have found no evidence to substantiate her claims about a cross-country killing spree.

Ashley Dean said Elytte Barbour loved the TV show 'Dexter,' and suggested that her sister was repeating its justifications for killing.

'If you listen to what she is saying, she is using descriptions from the show,' Dean told The Daily Item.

In 'Dexter,' a Miami Police Department blood-spatter analyst secretly sought out proven killers and killed them to prevent them from finding more victims.

Behind the stories: Local investigators in three murder locations named by Barbour are taking the claims seriously, but said they have no unresolved homicides they know about

Dean's assertions make her at least the second relative to cast doubt on her tale.

Barbour's father, Sonny Dean, told The Daily Item in February that his daughter was a heroin addict, a liar and a manipulator who 'lives in a fantasy world.'

Barbour claimed in her first jailhouse interview on February 14 that she killed at least 22 other people over six years in a cross-country murder spree motivated by her satanic cult beliefs.

During her second jailhouse interview at the State Correctional Institution in Muncy, a maximum security womenâ€™s prison, Barbour repeated her claims and said the FBI have not questioned her.

The Daily Item reported that local investigators in three murder locations named by Barbour are taking the claims seriously, but said they have no unresolved homicides they know about.

Barbour said she dumped some body parts in Big Lake, Alaska, and also in Mexico Beach, Florida where she worked as a 15-year-old go-go dancer.

She also said she dumped a body off Interstate 95 near Raleigh, North Carolina.
