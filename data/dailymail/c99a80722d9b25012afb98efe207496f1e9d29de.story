A children's charity volunteer wrote a reference for paedophile Stuart Hall praising his charity work, a court heard today.

NSPCC East Cheshire branch chairman Patricia McMillan wrote a letter of reference praising Hall's work as a charity auctioneer since 2008, his barrister Crispin Aylett QC told Preston Crown Court.

It came to light as Mr Aylett put Hall's mitigation to the court, which also revealed Wigan Athletic FC chairman Dave Whelan had written Hall a reference again praising the work he had done for charity.

An NSPCC spokesman later confirmed that Mrs McMillan had resigned from her role with the charity.

Mr Aylett asked the judge to carry out the sentencing with a degree of proportion, saying: ‘My task this morning is to apologise for what the defendant has done and to ask for the mercy of the court.’

‘It is not my intention to pick a fight with all of those who have put pen to paper on the subject of the life and times of Stuart Hall.’

Victim 1: Susan Harrison, formerly Melville, who waived her right to anonymity. Met Hall aged 16 at an awards day in 1967. He later touched her under her skirt while giving her a lift home from BBC studios.

Victim 2: 17-year-old who met Hall during early 1970s filming of It's A Knockout. He pushed her against a hotel door and fumbled her until she fought him off.

Victim 3: Kim Parker, formerly Wright, who waived her right to anonymity. Met Hall in Blackpool in 1974 when she was 16 or 17. He touched her breasts as she worked on an exhibition stand.

Victim 4: Aged 17 when she was pushed against a wall and had her breasts groped by Hall while at a family friend's house.

Victim 5: A 13-year-old who met Hall at a party at the house of his family friends. She got drunk and he carried her to the bathroom where he assaulted her in a 'frenzied maul'.

Victim 6: Was 15 when she met Hall as he worked on BBC North West Tonight. He kissed her in her home and on a later date approached her with a battery-powered massager which he asked to use on her private parts when she used his dressing room to get changed.

Victims 7, 8 and 9: An 11-year-old, 14-year-old and another girl aged 13 or 14 who attended elocution lessons together at Hall's home. He dressed them in men's shirts and fondled them as he wore only small white underpants.

Victim 10: Was aged 10 when her family was given tickets to It's A Knockout. He invited her to swim in his outdoor pool and bought her steak and champagne before fondling her in the bathroom.

Victims 11 and 12: Girls aged nine and 13 who Hall knew through family friends. He indecently assaulted the younger girl as she lay half-asleep in her home. He forced the elder girl to kiss him after suddenly pulling over while taking her home from a tennis centre.

Victim 13: Was aged 10 or 11 and was offered an elocution lesson by Hall at his home. He took her to his bedroom and told her to take her clothes off, where he held a tape measure around her chest as she practised saying sentences.

Mr Aylett said that his client - later jailed for 15 months - had been arrested ‘as a consequence’ of the investigation into Jimmy Savile ‘who used young girls on a scale that is simply staggering’.

He referred to the 1,300 complainants in that case and said: ‘Instead, in the dock today is a frightened and bewildered 83-year-old man answering for the touching - no more, no less - of all of 13, not 1,300, victims over a quarter of a century ago.’

He said many years had passed since the last offence and that Hall had led an ‘unblemished life’ over those years, doing charity work and with the support of his loving family.

The barrister said the defendant had pleaded guilty and that there was ‘very little evidence’ of sexual arousal on the part of the defendant.

‘Inevitably some of the victims were 
more affected than others. In the main victims appear to have kept their
undoubtedly unpleasant experiences in proportion to the actual abuse 
they suffered.

‘In many 
cases this appears to have manifested itself in them being revolted by 
the sight or sound of the defendant on television or radio.’

Referring
to the victims who were assaulted during Hall's ‘elocution lessons’ Mr 
Aylett said they had expressed a ‘degree of ambivalence in regard to 
what happened to them’.

He 
said one victim told police the assault was ‘not a serious indecent 
assault’ and she was thankful that nothing worse happened.

Mr Aylett said many of the victims had
the similar ‘refrain’ in that they told police they had come forward 
out of concern that the defendant may do the same to others, or 
something more serious than what happened to them.

The
barrister also said that many of the victims had told their parents 
about the abuse at the time but that they had taken no action.

He said with the exception of two of 
the complainants, all the victims who were under 16 had told an adult 
and none of them had contacted police or sought to take it up with the 
defendant.

Mr Aylett said he was not criticising ‘any of those adults’ or saying that ‘standards were different in the 70s’.

But
he said it did ‘reflect on the minor nature of the abuse’ - with the 
one exception of the 13-year-old girl Hall attacked in a bathroom, which
he conceded was a more serious assault.

Mr
Aylett said that even at the ‘height of his fame’ Hall took the time to
write to fans, many of them ‘elderly and lonely’ and that Hall still 
had the ‘love and support of his family.’

The
barrister rubbished claims in a newspaper that Hall had spent years 
‘laughing in the faces of his victims’ and said that it was Hall's 
‘celebrity’ which had brought him to the attention of the police.

He said ‘but for his celebrity’ the offences ‘would never have seen the light of day.’

He
said Hall ‘brought laughter to millions’ as the presenter of It's a 
Knockout and Jeux Sans Frontieres, the latter of which reached a 
European TV audience of 200 million people.

The
lawyer said Hall then went on to be an accomplished football reporter 
on the radio renowned for his ‘linguistic craftsmanship’. He said Hall was frail and suffering from numerous health problems and had suffered from depression and anxiety since his arrest.

He said Hall's comments outside magistrates' court when he said his accusers were telling ‘spurious’ and ‘pernicious lies’ were ‘ill-advised’.

'One can only begin to imagine the defendant's fear as the cell door slams shut on that first night'

Mr Aylett also criticised the probation officers who wrote the pre-sentence report, saying they ‘did not like Mr Hall’. He said: ‘One of them said, 'I hope you get five years and they take you for every penny that you've got.’'

The judge called these remarks ‘disgraceful’. Mr Aylett said the nature of fame had changed over the years and that in the 60s and 70s it was a ‘different world’.

He said Hall was 83 and would find prison very hard, adding: ‘One can only begin to imagine the defendant's fear as the cell door slams shut on that first night.’

The NSPCC posted the following statement on its official Twitter site: ‘We'd like to clarify that the NSPCC did not supply a character reference for Stuart Hall.

‘The views were of a volunteer speaking in a personal capacity and do not in any way reflect the views of the NSPCC.’

A spokesman for the charity later added: 'The volunteer concerned has now stood down from her role with the NSPCC.

'Our priority is, and always will be, to the victims of child abuse and we will not allow anything to get in the way of this.'
