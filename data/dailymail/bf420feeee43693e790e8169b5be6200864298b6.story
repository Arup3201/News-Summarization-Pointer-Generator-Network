As China's most senior politicians gathered  in Beijing's imposing Great Hall of the People to discuss the most serious and destructive issues affecting the country's 1.35billion residents, outside, a carnival was in full swing.

The opening session of China's annual National People's Congress (NPC) saw 3,000 Communist Party delegates from across the country meet to address 
long-running issues of choking smog, the new threat of terrorism and how to promote unity among the 
country's ethnic minorities.

But outside in Tiananmen Square 
stewardesses jumped for joy while delegates posed for photographers in 
their traditional regional dress at the start of the event - which has 
been described as China's political theatre.

Before the meeting started delegates paused to observe a moment of silence for the 29 people killed and 143 wounded in a terrorist attack at a train station in Kunming last week.

In his first annual policy speech, Premier Li Keqiang vowed to move more people into the 
middle class, cut government waste and fight rampant official corruption.

Li also promised to address issues of pollution that has seen stifling smog spread across China fouling of the country's 
air, water and soil.

He said: The government will work harder to 
reduce pollution by shutting more coal-fired furnaces and controlling 
the tainting of rivers.'

Military delegates arrive for the National People's Congress (NPC) during which the government announced a 12.2 percent increase in military spending, taking the total to $132 billion

Security around the Great Hall of the People was also tight with police checking vehicles entering Tiananmen Square

Li did not specifically mention 
Saturday's attack in his policy report, but said China would toughen its
 controls on public order, 'crack down hard on violent crimes of 
terrorism, safeguard China's national security, create good public order
 and work together to ensure public security in China.'

Chen Fengxiang, a delegate from Hubei, said during the session that the government would take stronger preventative measures following the attack by black-clad assailants wielding large knives.

He went on: 'They lost their senses, and we must crack down harshly and take strict measures in preventing the violence.

Li also outlined plans to make the world's second-largest economy more open and competitive while increasing military spending by 12.2 per cent to $132 billion.

The government said it would increase the defence budget by 12.2 percent this year to $131.57 billion, as China seeks to develop more high-tech weapons and to beef up coastal and air defences

In a further show of worsening diplomatic relations between China and Japan Li accused Tokyo of renewed militarism and referenced the country's history as an aggressor during World War II.

'We will safeguard the victory of World War II and the postwar international order, and will not allow anyone to reverse the course of history,' Li said.

The increase follows a nearly unbroken 20-year run of double-digit hikes in the Chinese defence budget, which is now second only to the United States in size.

'This is worrying news for China's neighbours, particularly for Japan,' said Rory Medcalf, a regional security analyst at the Lowy Institute in Sydney.

Those who thought China might prefer to concentrate on domestic development over military expansion in a slowing economy had "underestimated the Chinese determination to shape its strategic environment", he added.

Within hours of the announcement, officials in Japan and Taiwan questioned the absence of any details on how Beijing will spend the money - concerns long echoed in Washington with China's defence budgets.
