Joe Ledley is not known for his scoring prowess but the bearded wonder leaves Leicester rooted to the foot of the Premier League thanks to his second-half header.

Boos rang out at the end after yet another decent performance had nothing to show for it.

It was a statement of the obvious but Nigel Pearson’s programme notes confirmed it in black and white. The matches against the clubs hovering round the relegation zone ‘are the ones that will probably be decisive in our season.’

Having beaten both Aston Villa and Hull since Christmas, it could be argued that his team have got the message despite the continuing danger of anger of being cast adrift at the bottom of the table.

If only FA Cup results counted in the Premier League. Leicester have knocked out top flight opposition in Newcastle and Spurs and next weekend bid to make it a hat-trick against Villa.

Sadly, back in the real world, it has been a season of toil for Pearson’s players, not helped by a dismal home record of two wins in the league.

The Thai owners continue to back their manager, to the extent that he was able to splash out a record £9.7million on striker Andrej Kramaric, who was named substitute.

This was an opportunity to sign off from the King Power in style – a quirk of the fixture list plus Chelsea’s Capital One Cup final means that the next time the Foxes are at home is the middle of March.

First on the agenda was avoiding a third straight league defeat against a side who have been resurgent under Alan Pardew.

The bandwagon hit a pot hole last week when Everton mugged Palace and left south London with all three points.

Pardew’s 100 per cent win record suffered a first dent but they still started this match in 13th place and with 23 points safely gathered in.

Confidence has risen and the way Palace started proved that. The first 10 minutes was all about the visitors with Jordon Mutch looking to join striker Dwight Gayle at every opportunity.

Decent build-up play did not equate to a real threat on Mark Schwarzer’s goal, though, and gradually Leicester came into the game.

Leicester striker David Nugent came close to scoring for Leicester however his header hit the woodwork 

Chief tormentor Riyad Mahrez has been at the African Cup of Nations with Algeria. From the heat of Equatorial Guinea to the chill of the Midlands but Mahrez’s only concession to the cold was gloves with his short-sleeved short.

More importantly, he looked in hot form and was at the centre of most of Leicester’s attacking moves.

Twice he set up David Nugent only for the striker to slice his shot-come-chip over and then Nugent headed Mahrez’s corner against the bar.

And when the winger tried a shot himself, Julian Speroni did his job in the Palace goal before Scott Dann blocked Nugent’s follow-up.

Speroni, in his bright green kit, was far the busier goalkeeper and kept his team on even terms with a stop to deny Jeffrey Schlupp.

As the home side launched attack after attack,  Dann and Wes Morgan both went up in an aerial challenge and cracked heads.

Both went down pole-axed and it was no surprise when Dann failed to reappear for the second half. 

Pardew made two substitutions and both were involved in Palace’s opener.

Having lived dangerously when Paul Konchesky’s low shot skimmed a post, the visitors hit back.

Sub one, Yaya Sanogo, who forced a block from Marcin Wasilewski, won a corner, which was taken by Dwight Gayle.

Sub two, Brede Hangeland, used his height to head Gayle’s flag kick back across the area and Ledley got the final touch for only his second league goal of the season.

Leicester had a chance to equalise immediately but Esteban Cambiasso paid the price for dithering and his shot was cleared.

Speroni turned out to be just as busy in the second half as the first and made one world-class stop from Jamie Vardy right at the end.
