An eyesore bus station dubbed 'the mouth of hell'  was today dramatically razed to the ground by thousands of explosives.

The dilapidated Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, a stark example of 1970s Brutalist architecture, was reduced to rubble in just six seconds after more than 2,200 explosive charges ripped through the redundant building, tearing it to the ground.

The dramatic collapse came after a five-minute warning siren which had sounded out across the four-acre site, warning the hundreds of locals who had gathered for the occasion that the demolition was about to take place.

This is the dramatic moment an eyesore bus station in Northampton dubbed 'the mouth of hell' was blown up to make way for redevelopment 

The dilapidated Greyfriars bus station, an example of 1970s brutalist architecture, was reduced to rubble in just six seconds following the blast

More than 2,200 explosive charges were used to tear down the archaic building, prompting bangs, rumblings and car alarms to go off 

The historic demolition was heralded by a five-minute warning siren which sounded out across the area before the blast took place 

An audible gasp then spread across the crowd as a series of loud bangs and rumbling echoed around the area, prompting car alarms to spontaneously go off nearby.

The historic event was also live-streamed online, after Northampton Borough Council pleaded with spectators not to watch it in person. 

Video footage taken from nearby shows the 20,000 tonne building crumbling downwards from left to right, before being enveloped in a cloud of dust, which slowly spread away from the demolition scene. 

The £5m operation had also seen residents evacuated from more than 400 nearby homes, as a precaution.

The 574ft long, three-floor building was built in 1976 and has dominated the Northampton skyline for almost 40 years.

But it faced criticism soon after it opened when mineral stalactites began forming inside. There were also concerns for safety in the 2000s when two people died after being hit by buses.

The building, which includes a car park and offices which have not been used for years, was once described in the Lonely Planet guide as 'infamously ugly'. In 2005, it also featured on Channel 4 series Demolition, fronted by Kevin McCloud, as the third in a list of 12 buildings that the public believed should be demolished.

The thick, grey smoke spread slowly away from the demolition scene. The clean-up could take until June, the council has warned

It was during the programme that McCloud - who also presents Grand Designs - coined its moniker 'the mouth of hell'.

The building was one of the most prominent examples of the Brutalism era, a style of architecture defined by concrete fortress-like buildings which flourished between the 1950s and mid-1970s. 

But the structure was costing taxpayers £500,000 in repairs per year, while the council claimed it would cost almost £30 million to renovate.

Its demolition is part of Northampton's regeneration programme and plans for new retail and leisure schemes are being considered. 

David Macintosh, leader of the council, said: 'It's funny because in the last couple of months, people have said: "We will miss it."

'It's not very well-liked, and is now redundant. "The mouth of hell" sums it up perfectly.'

After the dramatic event, residents said they were glad the 'eyesore' had been finally removed from their city's skyline after 40 years

After the blast, residents said they were glad the 'eyesore' had been finally removed from their city's skyline.

Lorry driver George Thompson, 43, said: 'I came down with the kids to show them the demolition because it isn't something that happens every day.

'It has a horrible reputation and has been a bit of an embarrassment for Northampton so it is definitely good to see the back of it.

'It was incredible to see it come down so quickly and cleanly, there were lots of gasps from the young ones watching.'

Full-time mum Sandra Jones, 33, added: 'It was an eyesore of a building and is no use to anyone now there is the new bus station.

'I know people who have avoided using buses around here for years because they didn't want to go inside that grubby old building.

'I'm definitely glad it has gone and at least it managed to give everyone some pleasure with the dramatic demolition.' 

Alan Carr, who spent some of his childhood in Northampton, wrote on Twitter: 'Is that smelly cafe still there in the basement in Greyfriars bus station? You'd see people dry heaving before they got on their buses.' 

A huge clean-up operation will now take place to clear the streets and nearby buildings of dust before the site is considered for new retail and leisure schemes.  

Mr Mackintosh said it would take until the end of June to clear rubble left by the demolition.   

The demolition expert who was responsible for bringing the bus station to the ground said the job was one of his 'top ten ever'.

Billy Young, project manager for DSM Demolition, added: 'The roads will accessible from mid to late afternoon on Sunday. Lady's Lane and Greyfriars will be one lane at first for the next few weeks but we hope to reopen them again fully after that.'

A replacement bus station opened last year but it got off to a bad start when police were called in to direct traffic, after queues of buses formed.
