Wayne Rooney should not shoulder the blame for England’s early exit from the World Cup according to Robin van Persie, who says the FA need to look at their own youth structure.

Van Persie claims Rooney and England played well enough against Uruguay to win and go through to the next round, and supported his fellow Mancheser United striker, who was heavily criticised after England’s opening defeat by Italy.

‘I watched most of the game against Italy and the whole game against Uruguay, and I think it is a shame. England played quite well and were so unlucky. Wayne worked his socks off, played very well and could have scored four goals so I don’t think he is to blame.

'Wayne is a great player. As I’ve said many times, Wayne was partly the reason I came to Manchester United.

'I never regretted saying that because by training and playing with him he’s shown me that he’s a world class player. He’s a great player and a great goalscorer.

‘He is always under massive pressure and that has been his life since he made his debut.

'He hit an unbelievable free-kick, had a good shot saved by the keeper, a header which hit the bar and he scored a goal. He’s not to blame, he gave his all for his country. It’s not fair to criticise him so much.

‘He missed three chances by inches, and that is the thin line between winning and losing, between going home and going through.’

And Van Persie believes the FA should look at their own coaching structure and invest more in youth development, as the Dutch and other leading European countries do: ‘Now it’s up to the FA to have a proper look and see where England can go in the future.

‘It’s very important to invest in youth, in good coaches and facilities for youngsters to play. There are loads of companies trying to encourage people to play more sport.

The more hours you spend playing football, combined with good coaches, that is what makes you a better player. So it is important is to invest in youth and try to develop young players.’
