It's not bad for a picture taken in the back garden.

The sun’s fiery surface is captured in incredible detail from 93million miles away.

The stunning shot was taken by  71-year-old Dave Tyler, a photographer and amateur astronomer.

Like many of us Mr Tyler has the odd pot
plant and a shed in his back garden. But, where we might have the 
compost heap or a vegetable patch, he has installed a 5-inch refracting 
telescope, equipped with a hydrogen-alpha solar filter.

The filter allows him to safely observe and photograph the high-energy activity on our nearest star.Mr Tyler said: ‘When you look at the Sun you are looking at a star in high-magnification and detail – it is fascinating. It is about understanding our existence and our place in the solar system.’

Mr Tyler, from High Wycombe, in Buckinghamshire, pieced together thousands of frames using computer software to create the picture.

What appear to be bursts of flame are known as filaments – when huge masses of superheated plasma jump off the Sun’s surface.

They are formed by short-lived 
magnetic loops hundreds of thousands of miles long that hold dense gas 
suspended thousands of miles above the 6,000C surface of the Sun.

Mr Tyler photographed the Sun from February 15 to 19, but was unable to follow it any further because of cloudy weather.

The retired engineer, who lives with 
wife Wendy, a teacher, and son  Thomas, 18, has been a keen  astronomer 
for the last 40 years.

He built his first telescope when  he was 29 and has been an  enthusiast ever since.

After taking the pictures, Mr Tyler pieced the images together like a jigsaw puzzle using computer software.

The filament appears etched on the 
surface of the sun but is actually far away from it, as the sideways 
photographs clearly show.

When the filament is seen from the side like this - it is known as a prominence.

Mr Tyler said: 'Filaments occur when magnetic fields have snapped.

'This in turn causes the local hydrogen plasma to jump off the surface of the sun in a sweeping arc.'

The telescope was fitted with a hydrogen alpha filter to capture these incredible shots from 93 million miles away

The white 'clouds' around the filament are breaks in the magnetic field.

Dave, a retired CAD mechanical designer, imaged the sun over 5 days.

Nasa has also produced its own version of Dave's images - but relies on an orbiting spacecraft to capture its shots of activity on the sun's surface.
