Founder: Prince Charles is 'well aware' of up to 100 potential job losses at The Prince's Trust

Prince Charles' charity for deprived youngsters is axing up to 100 jobs to save on administration costs.

The move comes after The Prince's Trust suffered a £2.8million funding shortfall last year which forced it to dig into its reserves.

Chief executive Martina Milburn said the Prince of Wales, who founded the charity in 1976 and is still its president, was 'well aware' of the proposed cuts and had backed them to focus on the front line.

All 1,300 of the charity's staff are being consulted on the redundancies, which are mostly expected to happen at the charity’s London headquarters.

Ms Milburn told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'Our head office has become a little too complicated and a bit too top heavy so we are basically slimming down head office and protecting our frontline delivery in order to get ourselves back to sort of break-even budget.

'We are looking at how, as a charity, our admin costs are as low as possible and our money going directly to young people is as much as possible.

'We are currently undergoing a period of consultation but we think it will be between 50 and 100 jobs so we will be going down from 1,300 to about 1,200.'

Ms Milburn said the heir to the throne was 'very well aware' of the use of reserve funds and of the move to slim down the staff.

'We felt it was very important to invest in young people in the recession,' she said.

'We have the reserves in the bank to do that and the trustees took the view, along with the executive, that reserves are there for a rainy day and that for young people all around the United Kingdom it was certainly raining.

'The Prince understands basic finances and how you need to make sure that you spend as small amount as you can on administration when you are a charity.'

A spokesman said the staff cuts may affect one 'small' element of the trust’s work with young people, but she could not confirm what that element would be because the plans are still out to consultation.

However, she said: 'We expect the number of young people we help to remain broadly the same.'

The trust still has £22 million in reserves and is not in debt, she added.

The Prince's Trust was founded to help 13 to 30-year-olds who are unemployed or have dropped out of school.

It now has centres throughout Britain which offer enterprise courses, team challenges for people lacking social skills and cash grants of up to £500.

The charity has more than 6,000 volunteers and helped a record 55,801 young people in 2012/13, up almost 2,000 on the year before and almost 10,000 on 2010/11.

In that time its income rocketed from £40million to £58million - but so did its spending.

The charity, whose top executive is paid almost £150,000, spent £80,000 more than it earned in 2012-13.

The amount of ready cash it held also dropped by more than £2million in a year.
