While attempting to trim some trees down, this amateur lumberjack got a little more than he bargained for.

Along with the help of his family member, the man attempted to sever the top part of a tall tree in his yard, while relying on the boy below to pull the rope.

‘This is what people do for fun in the Outer Banks,’ a dead-panned voice says off-camera, recording the event. ‘Chop down trees, yay.’ 

Along with the help of a family member, this amateur lumberjack attempts to cut down a tree in his yard

The Outer Banks is a several hundred mile-long string of barrier islands off the coast of North Carolina in the US.

While the video starts out harmless enough, the experience quickly becomes a nightmare for all involved - and potentially those walking by. 

As the man slices the chainsaw through the thin trunk, the entire top gives way and comes crashing down on top of him.

However, the boy pulling the rope below didn't quite do so correctly, causing a major mishap

Once the top was severed, it came crashing down - on top of the man who had just cut it!

In the process, the man also lost grip of his chainsaw, allowing it to fall several stories to the ground

If that's not horrifying enough, the chainsaw also slips from his hands, falling several stories down.

The aspiring outdoorsman himself also falls, supported by the elevated platform he was standing on.

Following the debacle, the videographer declares: ‘There’s no way that was safe.’
