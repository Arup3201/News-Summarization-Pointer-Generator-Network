A lesbian cheerleader accused of having sex with her 14-year-old classmate may be headed to jail as it is revealed she continued their relationship despite court orders for her to stay away.

Court documents accuse Kaitlyn Hunt, 19, of Sebastian, Florida, of 'covertly contacting her victim thousands of times' on an iPod she smuggled to the girl and even of telling her to 'Keep the f**k quiet' about it.

Some of the explicit messages contain footage of Hunt 'masturbating while moaning' and the state claims Hunt and the girl had sex as recently as two weeks ago. Meanwhile, her mom Kelley Hunt Smith may have helped her daughter cover her tracks.

New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her

Explicit: Prosecutors say that included in the 20,000 messages were photos of Hunt's vagina

Just last month, Hunt was offered a plea deal by prosecutors, one that would trade a potential 15 year prison sentence and a lifetime on sex offender registries for three years probation.

Hunt had not decided whether or not to take the deal as of Wednesday, but it is likely no longer an option.

According to prosecutors, Hunt's girlfriend recently told detectives about the illicit contact they had while Hunt was out of jail on bond awaiting trial and that Hunt would 'drive the child to a remote location where they would have intimate physical contact.'

The new evidence indicates Hunt and the girl, until recently, were in contact almost daily since Hunt's last day at Sebastian River High School in March.

Civil rights? Kaitlyn Hunt's parents took her case public after they claimed she was targeted because she is gay. While out on bond and barred from seeing the girl, Hunt may have had sex with her as recently as July

'I'm out of jail on bond,' Hunt told the unnamed girl in a May message warning her not to tell anyone they were in communication, otherwise, 'I'll sit in jail until trial starts.'

'No matter what,' Hunt wrote. 'If they find out we talked I'm going to jail until trial starts.'

The state claims to possess over 25 lewd photos the defendant sent to her lover's iPod, photos which show her fully nude and sometimes pleasuring herself.

The girl's parents have remained adamant, from the time they first brought charges against Hunt earlier this year, that she should be prosecuted as a sex offender.

Criminal? Hunt could be hauled away from an emergency hearing scheduled for August 20 in cuffs if a judge finds she violated her court orders to stay away from her 14-year-old girlfriend

The case garnered nationwide attention after Hunt's father Steven Hunt and mother Kelley Hunt Smith took the case public with social media campaigns and television appearances in support of their daughter, who had just turned 18 when her relationship with the girl began.

On or around May 21, the documents 
allege, Hunt discovered her lover had told her parents about their 
continued relationship.

Worldwide support: Thousands of people have protested against the prosecution of Hunt as a sex offender. But will they support her if she broke the terms of her bond with the aid of her mother?

'F**k you..you're stupid,' she wrote. 'You want me to go in jail...You're such a messed up person...you snitched on me. God only knows what you'll do when pressed in court. Bye.'

The two continued to converse, and on May 29, Hunt wrote, 'If my mom finds out we're talking, I'm blaming it on you.'

The defendants mom, Kelley Hunt Smith, did find out. But the court documents suggest that, instead of putting an end to the contact, Smith tried to help her daughter cover her tracks.

'Delete EVERYTHING,' Smith wrote in a text message to the girl. 'PLEASE delete everything and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.'

Incriminating messages from Kaitlyn's girlfriend were also included in the court filing.

'Chill out, I'm f***king with you,' wrote the unnamed girl. 'Babe, you need to like smoke a Black and Mild or something.'

To which Hunt replied: 'KK rolling our blunt now.'

Ms. Hunt was not immediately available for comment, but the court documents make clear just how seriously the prosecution is taking these newest revelations.

'It is apparent that the conduct of both the defendant and Kelley Hunt Smith is severely threatening the integrity of the judicial process,' read the documents.

Hunt had in just the past month been urged to accept the new deal which would keep her out of jail and prevent her from being registered as a sex offender  - if she pleads no contest to two misdemeanor battery counts and one felony count for interference of child custody.

Her case attracted a glut of publicity after her parents did multiple interviews, claiming that their daughter was only charged because she is gay. As of May, 300,000 people have signed an online petition to have the charges against the teenager dropped.

If she goes to trial, she faces 15 years in prison if convicted on the two original charges of lewd or lascivious battery alone.

Under a previous plea deal in May, 
Kaitlyn would have been forced to register as a sex offender as well as 
remain on house arrest for two years.

The latest plea deal was offered by the Florida state attorney's office in July, reported CNN, because it balances the needs of Hunt, the unidentified teenage girl and their parents.

Under the deal, Hunt would have a curfew of 11pm for the first year of her 3-year probation.

She
 would also have had to agree never to contact the 14-year-old girl 
again. Her criminal record would later have been expunged or sealed.

Hunt's parents say that the 
younger girl's parents demanded that Kaitlyn be arrested because they 
can't come to terms with the fact that their teenage daughter had a 
relationship with another girl.

Thousands have signed petitions in support of Florida teen Kaitlyn Hunt after she was jailed and charged with lascivious battery of a minor. But while she and her parents gave national interviews maintaining her consensual relationship was innocent, Hunt was breaking court orders that she stay away from her 14-year-old girlfriend and could now lose a plea deal offer and face additional felony charges. According to the documents:

February 17, 2013: A Vero Beach court gives 'no contact' order banning Hunt from 'direct or indirect' contact with the girl

March 1: On Hunt's last day at Sebastian River High, she slipped an iPod into the girl's locker and kept in almost daily contact for months and eventually exchanged 20,000 messages with the device

May 25: Hunt messages the girl, warning her to 'Keep the f**k' quiet

May 29: 'If my mom finds out we're talking,' wrote Hunt, 'I'm blaming it on you.'

But Hunt's mother knew already, it seems. Back in March, documents indicate Kelley Hunt Smith contacted the girl herself. 'PLEASE delete everything,' Smith wrote, 'and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.'

Hunt's
 family claim that the relationship between the two girls was 
consensual. However under Florida law, a person under the age of 16 is 
not considered to be able to legally consent to sex.

The victims' parents say that they are only protecting their daughter and it has nothing to do with her being gay.

Kaitlyn has said the legal battle has been emotionally draining.

She was expelled from Sebastian River High School near central Florida's Atlantic coast. 

'Every day's different. Some days I'm my happy self. Some days I'm overwhelmed, some days I'm scared,' she said.

Gay rights advocates say older high 
schoolers dating their younger counterparts is an innocuous, everyday 
occurrence that is not prosecuted – regardless of sexual orientation – 
and not a crime on par with predatory sex offenses.

Hunt
 played on the basketball team with her younger girlfriend and shared 
the same circle of friends, said Hunt's mother, Kelley Hunt Smith previously said.

The
 two had a consenting relationship that began soon after Kaitlyn Hunt 
turned 18, and Mrs Hunt Smith said she assumed the younger girl's parents 
knew that.

But
 Hunt was kicked off the basketball team near the end of last year after
 the coach learned of the relationship because players were not allowed 
to date each other, her parents said.

Then,
 in February, prosecutors filed charges against her. The day before she was arrested, police and the younger 
girl's parents secretly recorded a phone conversation in which the two 
girls discussed kissing in the school bathroom, said Hunt's father, 
Steve Hunt.

Massive push: A 'Free Kate' Facebook page has generated more than 35,000 followers so far, and an online petition urging that the charges be dropped already has nearly 120,000 signatures
