Disease hub: New York's JFK airport is the worst possible place for a traveller infected with a new illness to travel through, according to a new study

New York's JFK airport is the worst possible place for a traveller infected with a new illness to travel through, according to a new study.

Travelling through JFK would mean the largest possible likelikhood of a global epidemic resulting from infected travellers.

Public health crises of the past decade —
such as the 2003 SARS outbreak, which spread to 37 countries and caused
about 1,000 deaths, and the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic that killed about 
300,000 people worldwide — have provided girim reminders hat new viruses or
bacteria could spread quickly across the globe, aided by air travel.

The MIT study used mathematical modelling to predict which airports would play the largest role in spreading disease.

Small airports such as Honolulu can play a disproportionately large part - others Los Angeles, Honolulu, San Francisco, Newark, Chicago (O'Hare) and Washington (Dulles).

‘Our work is the first to look at the
spatial spreading of contagion processes at early times, and to propose
a predictor for which 'nodes' — in this case, airports — will lead to 
more aggressive spatial spreading,’ says Ruben Juanes, the ARCO 
Associate Professor in Energy Studies in CEE.

‘The findings could form the basis 
for an initial evaluation of vaccine allocation strategies in the event 
of an outbreak, and could inform national security agencies of the most 
vulnerable pathways for biological attacks in a densely connected 
world.’

But a new study by researchers in MIT's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) shifts the focus to the first few days of an epidemic, determining how likely the 40 largest U.S. airports are to influence the spread of a contagious disease originating in their home cities.

This new approach could help determine appropriate measures for containing infection in specific geographic areas and aid public health officials in making decisions about the distribution of vaccinations or treatments in the earliest days of contagion.Unlike existing models, the new MIT model incorporates variations in travel patterns among individuals, the geographic locations of airports, the disparity in interactions among airports, and waiting times at individual airports to create a tool that could be used to predict where and how fast a disease might spread.

Existing models typically assume a random, homogenous diffusion of travelers from one airport to the next.However, people don't travel randomly; they tend to create patterns that can be replicated. Using González's work on human mobility patterns, Juanes and his research group — including graduate student Christos Nicolaides and research associate Luis Cueto-Felgueroso — applied Monte Carlo simulations to determine the likelihood of any single traveler flying from one airport to another.

Spreaders of disease: The new study looked at which of 40 U.S. home airports would have the worst impact on spreading disease

‘The results from our model are very different from those of a conventional model that relies on the random diffusion of travelers … [and] similar to the advective flow of fluids,’ says Nicolaides, first author of a paper by the four MIT researchers that was published in the journal PLoS ONE.

‘The advective transport process relies on distinctive properties of the substance that's moving, as opposed to diffusion, which assumes a random flow. If you include diffusion only in the model, the biggest airport hubs in terms of traffic would be the most influential spreaders of disease. But that's not accurate.’For example, a simplified model using random diffusion might say that half the travelers at the Honolulu airport will go to San Francisco and half to Anchorage, Alaska, taking the disease and spreading it to travelers at those airports, who would randomly travel and continue the contagion.In fact, while the Honolulu airport gets only 30 percent as much air traffic as New York's Kennedy International Airport, the new model predicts that it is nearly as influential in terms of contagion, because of where it fits in the air transportation network:

Its location in the Pacific Ocean and its many connections to distant, large and well-connected hubs gives it a ranking of third in terms of contagion-spreading influence.
