These are the intimate pictures that show John Edwards and his mistress Rielle Hunter are still very much involved.

The pair was spotted playing happy families at a beach house on Figure Eight Island, North Carolina over the weekend - which no doubt came as a welcome break following Edwards's corruption trial and ahead of the release of Hunter's lurid tell-all book.

The disgraced former presidential candidate and his mistress were seen relaxing with glasses of wine on the balcony of their $4,000-a-week beach house and laughing with their four-year-old daughter Quinn - and looked the happiest they have been in months.

Happy families: John Edwards, his mistress Rielle Hunter and their four-year-old daughter Quinn are pictured enjoying a weekend away at a beach house in North Carolina

They appeared oblivious to the storm 
Hunter's memoir has created after it gave explicit details of their 
affair and made a savage attack on his late wife Elizabeth.

The trio shared jokes as they paddled in the sea and relaxed on the beach house balcony. Hunter, 48, looked at ease in a white tankini as she held her daughter's hand and strolled down to the waves for a swim.

Edwards,
 59, wearing light blue shorts and a navy polo shirt, looked a world away
 from the broken man at his corruption trial as he laughed with the daughter he referred to as 'precious' in his speech following his acquittal.

With daughter Quinn, they looked very much a family, despite Hunter's own admission she is uncertain of the future of her relationship with Edwards.

'I really have no idea what will happen with us,' she wrote in her memoir. 'The jury is still out. But I can honestly say that the ending is of no concern to me anymore. The love is here. And as sappy as it may sound, I love living in love.'

But the images show Hunter can be certain of one thing: Edwards's devotion to his youngest daughter. Photos of the father and daughter laughing and playing on the beach come in stark contrast with Edwards's one-time claims that the girl was not his.

Getting some rest: As Edwards and Quinn giggled on the balcony of their $4,000-a-week beach house, Rielle took a short nap

But after Edwards, who was hauled to 
court on charges he had used campaign funds to cover up his affair with 
Rielle, was found not guilty on one count of corruption, he spoke about his 
love for all of his children, including the four-year-old love child.

Despite having publicly denied for two 
years that he was her father, he said: 'My precious Quinn, who I love 
more than any of you can ever imagine, who I am so close to, so, so 
grateful for.'

The father and daughter were seen playing on the sand on Sunday close to where they were staying. Later they held hands when they went to pick up groceries with her mother Rielle, who was also at the house.

The disgraced senator has only ever been pictured with Quinn once before when she was a baby in 2008. The photos, published in the National Enquirer, broke the news of the scandalous affair which Edwards had been keeping secret from his wife Elizabeth who was dying of cancer.

Edwards had four other children with Elizabeth - Wade, who died in 1996, Cate, Emma-Claire and Jack.

The trip also comes as excerpts from Hunter's tell-all memoir, due out 
June 26, are slowly being leaked to the public. One chapter describes the first time she slept
 with John Edwards as the 'most extraordinary night of her life'.

The couple met in February 2006 at the Regency Hotel in New York City. 
Hours after Hunter approached the former North Carolina senator, he 
called her up to his hotel room for a night of 'surrender' and 'zero 
sleep'.

'The connection I felt when I walked 
in the door had only grown and the amount of energy between us was huge 
and unstoppable,' Hunter writes in the book, according to an excerpt obtained by Radar Online.

'Then a moment came while we were 
talking when something in my heart clicked and I surrendered. I took off
 my teacher hat, let go of all my resistance to him and let him lead. 
And lead he did. He led me toward the most extraordinary night of my 
life. There was a lot of talk, a lot of laughter and zero sleep.'

But Hunter says she didn't give in 
easily to sleeping with a married man - it took Edwards telling her a 
story about having three other mistresses to get her into bed that first
 night they met.

'He told me that he had an entire 
hidden life that had gone on for decades and that he was currently 
involved with three different women. One lived in Los Angeles, one in 
Florida, and one in Chicago,' Hunter writes, according to Radar Online.

'Clearly, this behavior of his was not
 going to change overnight... I also told him that if I was going to 
help him, he couldn't lie to me. He needed to have one person in his 
life that was safe for him. He said that wasn't a problem, and when he 
said that, I felt a wave of total relief roll off of him.

The body that ruined a political career: Rielle, 48, looks svelte in a white tankini as she walks with Quinn along the beach

Baring all: In her memoir, out next week, Hunter says the first time she slept with Edwards was the 'most extraordinary night of her life'

Forgetting their troubles: Hunter watched over her daughter as she played in the sand near their rented beach house

The trio left the beach together, clearly relaxed with one another. Rielle donned casual Crocs shoes while Edwards' t-shirt revealed a slight paunch

'He needed this
 safe place. Somewhere in the midst of our talk, long after I realized 
how far off the rails his marriage was, and for how long it had been 
that way, something happened between us.'

She soon joined his campaign, and despite a lack of film-making experience, the politician arranged a $250,000 contract for her to make a series of behind-the-scenes documentaries from the campaign trail.

Hunter also attacks Edwards's wife Elizabeth, who died in December 2010 of 
breast cancer, calling her 'crazy,' 'venomous' and a 'witch on wheels.' 
She says her abusive behavior toward John Edwards drove him into the 
arms of other women.

Edwards seemed relaxed and right at home on the weekend getaway with his youngest child as he sipped a drink in the ocean breeze

The trio arrived at the beach house together along with Quinn, who was bedecked in hearts

Young Quinn beamed up at her father as he unloaded the trunk, including a bottle of white wine

Even though it appeared the family weekend included a trip to a toy shop for some new stuffed animals, little Quinn looked less than happy on one trip from the house

Other accounts of the 2008 
presidential campaign, including 'Game Change' by journalists John 
Heilemann and Mark Halperin back up Hunter's portrait of Elizabeth 
Edwards as controlling and potentially abusive.

When Hunter fell pregnant, Edwards had a 
trusted aide, Andrew Young, claim paternity of Quinn in an effort to stave
 off political disaster.

n her book, Hunter lambasts Young for his role in covering up the affair. She says it was Young's idea for Edwards and 
Hunter and lie and say Hunter's baby belonged to him and not the
 presidential candidate, a bizarre fiction she later bitterly regretted.

Hunter repeated the lie in an interview 
with the National Enquirer and Edwards, famously, told ABC News during 
an August 2008 broadcast that the baby was not his.

Fatherly love: After his acquittal last month, Edwards called his daughter 'precious' - even though he publicly denied she was his for two years

Love child: Quinn is Edwards's fifth child. He had four with his ex-wife Elizabeth, who died from cancer in December 2010

Day out: Edwards, who asked his aide to pretend to be Quinn's father, is seen walking from the beach after the day out

As the arrangement became farcical Hunter actually lived with the Youngs and their small children as she pretended
 to play happy families with them. Edwards didn't publicly 
acknowledge his love child until 2010, when she was nearly two.

The memoir is not the first time this year that details of the affair have been told to the public. Intimate details were revealed during Edwards's trial, which culminated with his acquittal on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions on May 31.

The judge declared a mistrial on five other felony counts. Federal prosecutors said earlier this month that they would not retry Edwards, and the charges against him were dropped.

Prosecutors had accused Edwards of masterminding a scheme to use about $1 million in secret payments from two wealthy political donors to hide his pregnant mistress as he sought the White House in 2008.
