One US graduand has managed to cause himself embarrassment during what is normally a graceful walk from one side of a stage to the other.

After shaking hands with administrators at Michigan’s Davenport University, Robert Jeffrey Blank couldn’t contain his excitement and decided to attempt a back flip.

Unfortunately, his back flip attempt was an instant fail.

Be careful: US college graduand Robert Jeffrey Blank fumbles mid-air to find the right landing position for his failed back flip attempt

Failing to rotate into the right position for the back flip fast enough, Mr Blank looks to have landed face-first on to the stage.

Luckily, it appears he didn’t suffer any serious injuries - picking himself up, dusting himself off and proceeding to exit, stage right.

Caught on camera by a university film crew – Mr Blank will be able to relive the joy, and shame, of his graduation ceremony for years to come.
