North Korea's second-most powerful man has reappeared on TV, contradicting reports that he may have been purged from the isolated nation's leadership.

Choe Ryong Hae was seen close to the country's leader Kim Jong-un in pictures taken in the past couple of months, smiling but sporting a limp.

His reappearance in public refutes recent speculation that he had been purged by Kim, whose shake up of North Korea's elite included the execution of his uncle last year.

Choe was seen enthusiastically taking notes as Kim visited various sites, and then appeared at a firing drill on a beach, Reuters reports. The news agency did not distribute the pictures.

The head of the political wing of North Korea's military, he appears to have risen to become the country's second most powerful man after the execution of Jang Song-thaek, Kim's uncle.

Choe's father was a partisan who fought alongside the Kim's grandfather Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea, in the guerilla war against Japanese occupation.

As well as his role as chief political operative for the North's 1.2million-strong army, he holds a seat in the powerful standing committee of the ruling Workers' Party politburo shared only by Kim himself and two figurehead old guard members.

Choe is also one of the two vice chairmen of the ruling Workers' Party central military commission, a post that encompasses two of the most powerful institutions, the party and the military.

He was made a vice marshal of the military this year.

In June, Choe was Kim's special envoy to meet President Xi Jinping of China, North Korea's only major ally. The meeting came amid annoyance from Beijing at North Korea's missile test and a third nuclear test last year.

It had been thought that Choe had angered Kim by taking management of several state-owned industries.

There are frequent reports in South Korean and other media of the demise or fall from grace of top officials in North Korea, a nuclear-armed state which is effectively closed to outsiders.

Kim's uncle Jang, 67, was executed in December, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime. Jang was married to Kim Kyong Hui, Kim's aunt and former leader Kim Jong-Il's sister.

It has since been claimed that members of his uncle's family, including his brothers, children and grandchildren, were rounded up by the dozen following his arrest and subsequent death in December.

As well as his uncle, other high-ranking members of the military are said to have been purged by Kim Jong-Un, including three defence ministers and three chiefs of the army's general staff.

Kim Chol, the vice minister of the army, was reportedly put to death in October 2012 by soldiers firing mortar rounds at him.

In August last year, members of a female musical group, Unhasu Orchestra - which included the dictator's ex-girlfriend - were reportedly publicly machine-gunned apparently for watching pornography and filming themselves naked.

Cheong Seong-chang, a North Korea expert at the Sejong Institute thinktank near Seoul, suggested that many of the reports coming from the country are unreliable.

He said: 'The Choe imprisonment rumour tells that it is hard to find out exactly what is happening inside North Korea.

'It is a problem to report information based on unreliable rumours from a source far away from Pyongyang.'
