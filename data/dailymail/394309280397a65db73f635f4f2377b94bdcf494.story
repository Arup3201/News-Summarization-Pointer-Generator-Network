Democratic convention delegates booed after the party voted to reinstate to its platform mentions of God and a declaration that Jerusalem was is the capital of Israel in their platform.

Many in the arena jeered after the convention chairman Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, of Los Angeles ruled that the amendments had been approved even though a large group of delegates had objected.

The party reinstated language from the 2008 platform that said 'we need a government that stands up for the hopes, values and interests of working people and gives everyone willing to work hard the chance to make the most of their God-given potential'.

Dissent: Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa declared that the 'God' amendment passed a voice vote -- despite loud opposition from some party members

President Barack Obama intervened directly to restore the God and Jerusalem language changed both on Jerusalem. But Republicans charged that Obama had authorised the changes in the first place and reversed himself only after a wave of public criticism.

The chaos in the arena was highly embarrassing for Democrats and the vote to change the platform appeared to be indecisive but was railroaded through by Villaraigosa anyway.

The fiasco exposed tensions on Israel within the party in a year when Jewish support could be crucial, especially in the swing state of Florida.

‘There was no discussion,’ said Noor Ul-Hasan, a Muslim delegate from Salt Lake City, who questioned whether the convention had enough of a quorum to even amend the platform. ‘We didn’t even see it coming. We were blindsided by it.’

Angela Urrea, a delegate from Roy, Utah, said: ‘The majority spoke last night," said. "We shouldn't be declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.’

Opposition: The Arab-American Democrats on the floor objected to both the 'God' language and the declaration that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel

Republicans pounced quickly on both omissions.

GOP
officials argued that not taking a position on Jerusalem's status in 
the party platform showed the president was weak in his support of 
Israel.

Republican presidential nominee Mitt 
Romney said omitting God 'suggests a party that is increasingly out of 
touch with the mainstream of the American people.'

'I think this party is veering further and further away into an extreme wing that American's don't recognize,' Romney said.

Confusion: Villaraigos was unsure what to do when the amendment didn't have a clear two-thirds majority in the first two voice votes

The Democratic Party's decision to 
restore the mention of Jerusalem reflected what advisers claim was the 
president's personal view, if not the policy of his administration. The 
administration has long said determining Jerusalem's status was an issue
that should be decided by Israelis and Palestinians in peace talks, but
has been careful not to state that Jerusalem is Israel's capital.

Romney's campaign quickly sought to capitalize on the slight, but important difference.

'Mitt
Romney has consistently stated his belief that Jerusalem is the capital
of Israel,' said Andrea Saul, Romney's spokeswoman. 'President Obama 
has repeatedly refused to say the same himself. Now is the time for 
President Obama to state in unequivocal terms whether or not he believes
Jerusalem is Israel's capital.'

The White House wouldn't say whether the change in the Democratic platform language reflected a change in administration policy.

Fixed? This is the language to was put back into the Democratic Party Platform after it was removed on Tuesday

Democratic National Committee 
chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said the reinstated party language 
reflected 'the policy of both Republican and Democratic administrations 
for decades.'

Following the decision, former Ohio Gov Ted Strickland told reporters, 'It was an effort to bring clarification.'

But the decision to amend the platform did not rest well with some delegates.

Republicans declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel in the platform the party approved last week at its convention in Tampa, Florida.
