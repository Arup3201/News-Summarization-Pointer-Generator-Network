While most green-fingered folk may list their gardening essentials as a spade, a trowel and a watering can, it seems the organisers of the Chelsea Flower Show have other ideas.

From a £365,000 'pleasure dome', complete with a £15,000 marble floor and a £12,000 chandelier, to a £274 pair of bonsai tree clippers, the show has everything you never knew you needed to create your very own green oasis.

For those summer days ahead, shoppers can pick up a £1,398 barbecue capable of cooking at up to 750C (1,400F).

Or to avoid the inevitable washout, why not invest in an outdoor kitchen with an automatic fold-out roof and windows that unfurl when the heavens open for just £42,000.
