It could have been a dog's life for Bluey who suffers from a seasonal allergy to the great outdoors - but no longer.

The eight-year-old Weimaraner, from Pembrokeshire, South Wales, now wears special doggie boots throughout the cold months to overcome his paw ailments.

Bluey was spending hours licking his paws after just a few minutes outside.

Owner Julie Farr, 38, a nurse, had been aware of the problem since he was a puppy.

But it worsened as soon as she moved away from the city.

Thanks to a pair of special dog boots, Bluey can enjoy playing outside with his friend, Jack Russell Percy.

'His feet were often inflamed and red. He would lick and bite them until I covered his feet in a blanket,' Julie said.

'I even tried tying carrier bags round his feet to ease the problem, but it wasn't very practical, so I found the boots online.

'At first he wasn't impressed, but now he will happily wear them.'

It's no longer a dog's life for Bluey in his new boots

As soon as the symptoms first appeared, Julie took Bluey to the vets, who was unable to diagnose exactly what the dog is allergic too, but said that it is likely to be something outdoors.

The dog was already unable to eat any meat other than fish and turkey and had to take allergy tablets.

Julie said: 'If I give him tablets it has to Piriton - no other brand is safe for dogs. I also had to wash his feet in surgical soap, before putting E45 cream on and giving him some socks to wear to stop him biting at them.

'I decided to shop around and see if I could get Bluey some boots to wear. I couldn't stand to see my poor boy moping around.'

Julie bought Bluey a set of Neo-Paws boots.

Made in Canada, the boots strap to his feet using velcro.

She said: 'I paid around $100 for them, but it's worth it for Bluey to feel better.

'It's lucky that it was Bluey and not Percy that needed the boots. If I so much as try to put a jumper on Percy he will refuse to move.'

Bluey has now been wearing the boots for three weeks and his paws have almost fully recovered.

Julie said: 'Bluey is getting on very well with the boots, prancing around like a puppy.

'He wasn't keen to put them on at all at first but I mentioned it to Ronnie, the lady at Neo-Paws, and she advised giving treats to encourage compliance, and just getting the boots on and going out so he doesn't have time to worry about them.

'He walked like a clown at first, very uncoordinated, but within a few minutes he was fine. He sounds like a horse now when he runs around.

'I think he quite likes them because they keep his feet warm and dry.'

Neo-Paws' owner Roanna Sabeh-Azar describes her company as 'Nike to the dog world'.

The outside world can be rough for canine companions if they are not dressed properly, she says, and her company specialises in pet clothing and other products.

Products include orthopedic dog shoes and boots, dog safety jackets and vests, rain body suits, pet carriers, and dog and people jewellery.
