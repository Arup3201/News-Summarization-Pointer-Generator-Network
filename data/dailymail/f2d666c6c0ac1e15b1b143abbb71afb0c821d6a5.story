Two rocket launchers were found among roughly 2,500 weapons exchanged for cash and tickets in Tampa Bay, Florida, on Saturday adding to the growing number of rocket launchers found at gun buyback programs in recent weeks.

The two massive firearms were discovered less a week after another rocket launcher was collected at a gun buyback event in New Jersey and a missile launcher was collected at a gun buyback event in Seattle.

Two rocket launchers were collected at a gun buyback event in Los Angeles a month prior.

The local sheriff's office in Hillsborough County, Florida, said the two recent rocket launchers were exchanged at separate swap locations

The local sheriff's office in 
Hillsborough County, Florida, said the two recent rocket launchers were 
exchanged at separate swap locations.

Bomb technicians inspected them to make sure they weren't loaded.

The sheriff's office said the response to its ‘Operation Gun Swap’ on Saturday was overwhelming.

People waited in long lines at five locations in the county to anonymously trade guns for $75 cash and ticket vouchers for the Tampa Bay Rays baseball team and the Tampa Bay Lightning hockey team.

Authorities say so many people showed up that they ran out of cash and tickets and deputies had to distribute vouchers for the same cash and ticket packages.

In late January, authorities in New Jersey collected more than 2,600 weapons in exchange for cash during a two-day gun buyback event over the weekend including an anti-tank rocket launcher.

In photos from the program taken at 
an evidence warehouse, the enormous weapon stood out among various 
handguns, rifles and sawed off shotguns.

In a similar event in Seattle just days before, a missile launcher turned up and authorities were unsure if it was legally acquired or possibly stolen from the military.

A man standing outside the event on Saturday, identified by Reuters as Mason Vranish, bought the military weapon for $100 from another person waiting in line, according to a local police detective.

In late December, Los Angeles police said two rocket launchers were handed in by the city's residents.

The hefty weapons were among nearly 2,000 guns given up to police in exchange for $100 and $200 grocery store gift cards.
