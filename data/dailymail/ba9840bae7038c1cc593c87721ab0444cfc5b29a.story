Crime gangs who fill up containers in their vans with stolen fuel to sell on on the black market are putting motorists' lives at risk, police warned today.

They say hundreds of thousands of pounds worth
 of petrol and diesel is being stolen from fuel stations around the 
country.

Officers fear many people could be killed if one of the vans crashed on a motorway and have urged other drivers to watch out for the vehicles which have been dubbed ‘molotov motors’.

Illegal trade: Police say fuel thieves who fill up plastic containers inside vans are risking a serious explosion

Thieves armed with corporate fuel payment cards are loading rented vans with water containers and then illicitly filling them up.

Investigators from City of London Police’s National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) have been increasingly concerned about soaring fuel thefts.

They said it is impossible to measure the exact scale of the problem but one company alone has already reported losses of £400,000 this year.

Crime gangs, mostly from Eastern Europe and Sri Lanka, are taking advantage of the weaker security on corporate fuel cards which don't have chip and pin technology.

They hire long wheelbase vans, often using bogus credit cards, and then fill the back with large water containers, similar to those used by campers.

The driver parks as close as possible to the fuel pump and discreetly fills the containers through the sliding passenger door as an accomplice helps from inside.

Gangs of fuel thieves are stealing petrol and diesel worth hundreds of thousands of pounds every week

Undercover officers have watched suspects drive long circular routes stopping off at almost every petrol station on the way to fill the maximum amount possible.

The vast majority of thefts take place on arterial routes into London, with Northampton and Milton Keynes the worst-hit areas in the country.

Thieves regularly travel up and down the M1 and M40, as well as the M3 and M27, stopping off at major towns to visit every petrol station.

Posing as tradesmen in fluorescent jackets, they can steal fuel worth £1,500 in one trip before returning to domestic garages to decant and store their haul.

In one case police discovered thieves were using a garage underneath a London block of flats to store 800 litres of petrol.

Motorists have been warned to keep their eyes peeled for the fuel thieves, who often drive rented vans

When they arrived they found a builder – who did not know about the fuel –smoking a cigarette as he used an electric saw outside.

Some of the fuel is sold at cheap rates on the black market, but the majority is handed to corrupt businesses who resell it and share the profit with the thieves.

John Unsworth, of the NFIB, said: ‘We have got criminals driving up and down our motorways with all of this fuel sloshing around in the back of their van.

‘There is an extraordinary risk to the general public. One discarded cigarette or an accident could result in catastrophic consequences.

‘At the heart of this crime are fuel cards which are being exploited because they do not have the latest security technology.

‘These criminals are pillaging one community after another, day in, day out. We need people to help us identify them.

‘If fuel station customers or staff spot these vans and people acting suspiciously they should call the police immediately.’

More than 70 people linked to the thefts have been arrested this year as the problem continues to grow.

Police also fear that vehicles may be damaged if motorists unwittingly buy bootleg fuel made up of different brands or which is contaminated with moisture.

Edmund King, of the AA, said: ‘It is an accident that is without a doubt waiting to happen.  Transporting such large quantities of volatile fuels is incredibly dangerous.

‘It really beggars belief that criminals are going to this extent, putting their lives and those of others at massive risk for the sake of profit.

‘Motorists should never buy cheap fuel. Firstly, it could be contaminated, and secondly it is encouraging this kind of dangerous criminal activity.’
