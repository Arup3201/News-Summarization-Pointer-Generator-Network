Juventus legend Alessandro Del Piero has lauded Cristiano Ronaldo as the 'future' of football but said Bayern Munich and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will win the Ballon d'Or.

Neuer, Real Madrid talisman Ronaldo and Barcelona's Lionel Messi are the final three contenders for the award, with the winner being announced on January 12.

Del Piero claimed that although 2013-winner Ronaldo's personal stats were hugely impressive, he felt Neuer would scoop the prestigious award.

'The three Ballon d'Or finalists are the best of the bunch, no question,' Del Piero told FIFA's official website. 'Cristiano Ronaldo's personal stats are truly impressive. A lot has been said about the concept of "the modern player", well this guy is not just modern but also of the future.

'Messi, for his part, is the real deal when it comes to No 10s. I remember during the World Cup in Brazil seeing countless kids wearing his jersey – even Brazilian youngsters wearing the shirt of an Argentine! He represents a type of football that transcends borders.

'As for Manuel Neuer, he's given us a new way of interpreting the role of a goalkeeper: not only is he very good with his feet, he also brings more mobility to his team. On top of that, he's obviously a superb shot-stopper and Germany's world title owed a lot to him.

'I'll chance a prediction and say the winner will be Neuer. He was integral to Germany's great World Cup and to a wonderful season for Bayern in the Bundesliga.'
