A Connecticut man was arrested after police say he wandered into the wrong home drunk and got in bed with a stranger, who woke up startled and called 911.

Police say the incident happened early Saturday morning at an apartment complex in Clinton. Officers say 26-year-old Tyler Sullivan of Haddam told officers he thought he was at his mother's apartment, which is in the same complex.

A man in the home said he told Sullivan to leave, but Sullivan refused. Police say Sullivan was still there when officers arrived.

Sullivan was charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct.

He was released on $1,000 bail and ordered to appear in Middletown Superior Court on Nov. 4.

It's not clear if Sullivan has a lawyer. A phone listing for him couldn't be found.
