The homemade pressure cooker bombs used in the deadly Boston Marathon explosions were triggered by a remote detonator of the kind used in remote-control toys, U.S. officials have revealed.

The officials said investigators found pieces of the remote-control equipment among the debris and were analyzing them.

Both U.S. officials are close to the ongoing investigation but spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Terror attack: The detonator has been described as 'close-controlled' - meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the devices

One official described the detonator as 'close-controlled' - meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.

Three people were killed and more than 250 others were injured when the bombs went off within seconds of each other near the finish line of the April 15 race.

A criminal complaint outlining federal charges against the surviving bombing suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, described him as holding a cellphone in his hand minutes before the first explosion.

Two officials on Wednesday said the bombs were not very sophisticated.

It was originally believed that the devices had been detonated by cell phones carried by the suspects.

Tsarnaev, described him as holding a cellphone in his hand minutes 
before the first explosion.

Cellphones have been used to trigger bombings in war zones.

His brother Tamerlan was an ardent reader of jihadist websites and extremist propaganda, including Inspire magazine, an online publication produced by al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate.

The English-language magazine is dedicated to spreading the terror group's message, and even includes instructions on how to construct explosive devices.

Fear: The explosions caused a panic in the city of Boston that had not been seen on U.S. soil since the 9/11 attacks

In the Summer of 2010, an infamous article entitled 'Make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom' listed a pressure cooker bomb as the 'most effective weapon.'

Another Inspire article has insisted that a good time to 'inflict maximum human losses' is during a sporting event.

The article reads: 'There are numerous such targets such as crowded sports arenas, annual social events, large international exhibitions, crowded market-places, skyscrapers, crowded buildings.'
