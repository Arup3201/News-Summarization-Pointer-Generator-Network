Apple could be forced to scrap its latest iPhone connectors under plans to create a universal phone charger in the European Union.

An EU Parliament Committee has voted to standardise power connectors so that everyone who buys a handset in the Union gets the same type of charger, expected to be a microUSB connector.

Yet Apple, and firms including Asus, use specially-designed connectors that only work with their own handsets and, if the proposals are passed, could be forced to stop selling them in certain countries in order to comply with the law.

The proposal passed with a unanimous vote and was filed in a bid to reduce the amount of waste created by old or unused phone chargers.

These changes would also benefit phone customers who could easily borrow or swap chargers, and could additionally be extended to include tablet connectors, too.

However, this hasn't been passed as a law yet, and may not ever become law; it was a vote carried by a single group of MEPs.

In a statement issued last week, the 
committee announced it 'will decide later whether to start informal 
negotiations with the Council in order to seek an early first-reading 
agreement.'

The majority of Android and Windows Phone handsets are charged using what's called a microUSB port - a smaller version of the USB ports used on many pen drives, laptops and PCs.

Apple is renowned for having unique chargers.

It introduced its Lightning connector in September 2012, which was shipped automatically with the then-new iPhone 5, and this connector replaced the Apple 30-pin connector that charged older models of the phone, as well as its iPods.

The Lightning connector is said to 
offer 'faster file transfers' when plugged into a laptop 
and can be inserted either way up.

An update in Apple's iOS 7 prevents users from charging their phones using non-Apple chargers.

Customers can still use the Lightning connector with other devices, but only if an adapter is bought separately for around £25.

This was suggested to have been in response to a number of injuries and a death of Apple customers in China who were said to have bought cheap, knock-off chargers.

This means every phone sold in the EU would have the same connector

Apple uses Lightning connectors that only work with iPhone 5, 5C and 5S

This ruling could mean it has to scrap this connector, but only in the EU
