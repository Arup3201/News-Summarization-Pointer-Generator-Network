A jealous wife kicked a woman between the legs in the aisles of a Tesco supermarket when she discovered she had an affair with her husband.

Lisa Wheelhouse, 28, was angry after she found out her former workmate Zoe Ford had an affair with her husband. 

A court heard Wheelhouse took revenge when she saw Miss Ford shopping in their local Tesco supermarket, in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire.

Prosecutor Ellie Morgan said: 'Miss Ford went to pick up a box from the shelves when she felt a push on her shoulder.

'She turned around and saw it was Wheelhouse who kicked out, catching her between the legs and causing her to fall into the shelves.'

The court heard Miss Ford's partner had to separate the two woman as shocked shoppers looked on.

Miss Morgan said: 'She told police she wanted to hurt Miss Ford like she had been hurt.'

Wheelhouse admitted assault by beating at the Tesco supermarket.

Phil Huxtable, defending, said: 'She had a letter from Miss Ford telling her about the affair and saying people were laughing behind her back.

'When Mrs Wheelhouse saw her in Tesco there was a build-up of emotions, she was overwhelmed and reacted in this way.

'There was a degree of provocation here and she has shown complete remorse.'

Wheelhouse, of Pembroke, was given a 12-month conditional discharge by Haverfordwest Magistrates who ruled it would be inappropriate to ask her to pay compensation to her victim.
