Rolf Harris faces being stripped of a string of honours awarded by the Queen and will lose his BAFTA fellowship following his convictions for indecent assault.

In an astonishing fall from grace for the man who painted the Queen’s portrait and sang in her Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Buckingham Palace is now likely to revoke his MBE, OBE, CBE and Officer of the Order of Australia.

A Government source told MailOnline Harris's case is to be considered by the independent honours forfeiture committee.

Fall from grace: Rolf Harris, who painted the Queen's 80th birthday portrait, faces being stripped of a string of honours awarded by the Monarch

'Honours are usually taken away if sentences are above three months, so would look almost certain in this case,' the source added.

The Cabinet Office said it could not comment on individual cases, but precedent confirms honours are forfeited in circumstances where the person is jailed for more than three months or considered to have brought the system into disrepute.

A recommendation is typically made by Whitehall’s honours and appointments secretariat to the forfeiture committee to revoke an honour if a person has been found guilty of a serious criminal offence.

Former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne’s 
ex-wife Vicky Pryce was stripped of the Companion of the Order of the 
Bath she was awarded in 2009 when she was a senior civil servant in the 
Government.

The Queen removed the honour after Pryce was jailed for eight months for perverting the course of justice after taking speeding points in 2003 for her then husband.

Boxer ‘Prince’ Naseem Hamed lost his MBE after being jailed over a high speed car crash in his £300,000 McLaren Mercedes in 2005.

Jockey Lester Piggott, meanwhile was convicted in 1987 of tax fraud which led to him spending one year and one day in prison, and was stripped of the OBE.

Recipients of honours can also lose them 
if they are censured or struck off by a professional or regulatory body 
for something relevant to their honour, or if they are judged to have 
brought the system into disrepute.

The Daily Mail revealed plans to humiliate banker Fred ‘the Shred’ Goodwin, who oversaw the near-collapse of RBS, by cancelling his knighthood, on that basis.

Harris was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later, and a CBE in 2006.

In 2005, the Queen sat for Harris while he painted her portrait, commissioned by the BBC to mark her 80th birthday. Then in 2012 Harris was one of the star performers at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

As well as his honours, Harris can expect to lose the BAFTA Fellowship he received two years ago.

‘The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) has made the decision to annul the BAFTA Fellowship bestowed upon Rolf Harris in 2012 following his conviction,’ a spokesman confirmed.
