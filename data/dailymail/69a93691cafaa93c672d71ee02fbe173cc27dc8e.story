The 35-year-old truck driver had suffered a massive heart attack and died from caffeine toxicity

A mother is determined that no one else will have to endure the pain of their child dying from consuming too many energy drinks.

Shani Clarke's son, Michael, used to drink at least four 500ml cans of Mother a day - as well as four to five cups of coffee before he was found slumped behind the wheel of the 11 tonne truck on the side of the road in Perth on January 30 this year.

The 35-year-old truck driver had suffered a massive heart attack and died from caffeine toxicity.

'I can't tell you the pain I felt at that moment, my heart just hit the floor and I sobbed and sobbed,' Ms Clarke said on Facebook.

Ms Clarke said she didn't realise her son was buying energy drinks until a few weeks before he died. 

'He was cleaning his truck out and I saw he had an armful of the big cans of Mother and I said "I hope your not drinking too many of them in one go" which he just shrugged off as we mums know nothing, I didn't think much more of it at the time.'

Ms Clarke decided to educate others on the possible perils of consuming too many energy drinks through the Facebook page - Caffeine Toxicity Death Awareness

The Facebook campaign has taken of with almost 500 members joining the cause

It wasn't until last month when the coroner told her how her son had died that she decided to educate others on the possible perils of consuming too many energy drinks through the Facebook page - Caffeine Toxicity Death Awareness. 

• Energy drinks are not made available in     primary nor secondary schools

• Marketing and advertising activities of energy drinks are not directed at children

• No promotional activities are undertaken that encourage excessive consumption of energy drinks

• Labels of energy drinks do not promote the mixing of energy drinks with any other beverage.

'I was so angry when I found out it was caffeine as I had lost my first born and it could have been avoided if he hadn't drank so many of these drinks without a break,' she said in the post.

'His body couldn't process the caffeine anymore and it built up in his body and it caused a massive heart attack.' 

Ms Clarke has received an overwhelming response since starting the page with many admitting they didn't realise the possible dangers and some have even given up the drinks.

One lady admitted to being addicted to cans of V for almost a decade.

'Today starts my sugar free September. And good bye v forever! I'm doing it cause I was unaware of this. It's hit to close to home. Not taking any chances.'

While another posted that she was unaware of the dangers of energy drinks. 

'I drink coffee in the morning and two energy drinks a day. I'm a truck driver, and I'm not quite sure what I'll do without those energy drinks, but I'm sure gonna try not to drink them anymore!'

A lot of people have decided to quit the energy drinks after learning Michael's fate

The avoidable death has also prompted experts to speak about the dangers of the energy drink.

Chair of general practitioners for the Australian Medical Association, Dr Brian Morton warned that people should not consume more than the equivalent of a total of two cups of coffee per day.

'The body is just not made to take that sheer capacity of toxic levels of chemicals' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The quantity that you have and the amount of caffeine you drink as a consequence will absorb into your body which can be quite significant such as a toxic effect,' he said. 

'It can unmask electrical abnormalities in the heart for example that you are born with - it is a short circuit in the electrical wiring that can cause sudden death.'

While WA Health's deputy chief health officer Andy Robertson told the ABC it was recommended not to consume more than 400 milligrams of caffeine a day - a  500ml can of a typical energy drink carries about 160mg.

Meanwhile, Australian Beverages Council CEO Geoff Parker said the Australian energy drinks market is one of the most regulated in the world.

'Products across the category are clearly labelled with a 500ml daily usage maximum,' he said 

'Australia’s strict regulations, in addition to a cap on the caffeine content, equivalent to an instant cup of coffee for a 250mL can (80mg), make our energy drink regulations the tightest in the world,'
