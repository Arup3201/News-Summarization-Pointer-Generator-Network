Last year, Cara Delevingne was rumoured to be dating One Direction star Harry Styles. This year, she's definitely partying with his bandmate.

The model was spotted enjoying tiki cocktails with Niall Horan in the Mahiki Coconut Lounge backstage at Virgin Media's V Festival.

The pair were joined by in the bar by members of the Saturdays as well as rugby player Ben Foden and JLS singer, Marvin Humes.

Cara was resplendent in pair of bright patterned trousers, topped with a neat grey T-shirt and a patriotic Union Jack emblazoned hat.

Niall plumped for pale pink paisley T-shirt, which he paired with baggy denim shorts and a pair of Nike hi-top trainers.

Prior to joining Cara for a cocktail, Niall had been spotted watching the Saturdays perform alongside Humes and Foden.

The trio watched as Mollie King and co took to the stage in denim shorts customised for them by Missguided.co.uk.

Cara Delevingne's drinking session with Niall Horan might have dominated conversation backstage but out front, it was all about the shorts.

Kate, 17, paired a delicate daisy print top with high-waisted black denim hotpants, while Beth, 19, teamed her pink shorts with a 90's-chic denim jacket.

Other stylish festival-goers included Lauren, 22, who plumped for sharply tailored shorts and a pair of bovver boots, and Victoria, 23, who bravely teamed her denim cutoffs with a fringed crop top.

The make-up gurus at MAC were this weekend's official make-up sponsor and, as well as being on hand to make up the likes of Beyonce and Rita Ora before their performances, the team set up camp in the Virgin Media Louder Lounge to make-over the likes of Pixie Lott and Jourdan Dunn, as well as festival goers looking for a dash more glamour.

Hordes of beauty aficionados queued up to be beautified by MAC (500 to be precise) and with festivals being the perfect opportunity to push the boundaries when it comes to make-up: there was lashings of glitter, smoky eyes, vampy lips and neon.

Speaking about this seaon's festival beauty favourites, Pablo Rodriguez, MAC Senior Artist, said: 'This festival season is all about neons, smokey eyes with a pop of colour and loud mouths.

'As for the face, it's all about the mineral look- I often use MAC blot powder to keep oil at bay.'

The beauty gurus managed to squeeze in a staggering 500 appointments and applied 400 sets of M.A.C False Lashes.

The team also had their body painting pros on hand, and had Louder Lounge Guests signing their neon MAC Wall.

The most popular look was a statement lip shade, with a MAC Pigment pressed on top – a beauty trick that really makes the lip shade pop and is perfect for the festival season.

Here is a backstage peek at which A-listers had their make-up done by the talented senior artists at MAC.
