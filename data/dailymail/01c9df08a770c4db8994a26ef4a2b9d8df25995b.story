Father James Martin, the Jesuit priest who had the unfortunate task of presiding over Philip Seymour Hoffman’s funeral this week, opened up about their decade-long friendship, saying that the actor had taught him humility.

Martin first met Hoffman when the actor reached out to him in 2003 seeking advice about the Labyrinth Theater Company's production of the Off-Broadway play 'The Last Days of Judas Iscariot directed by Hoffman.

The clergyman and writer also helped Hoffman with the part of Father Flynn in the 2008 film 'Doubt' starring Meryl Streep about a priest in a Catholic school who may or may not have molested a boy. The role earned Hoffman an Academy Award nomination.

In preparation for 'Doubt,' Hoffman and Father Martin would go to Saint Ignatius Church to teach the actor, who had been raised Catholic, how a priest celebrates Mass.

Martin recalled to People Magazine how one time a parishioner entering the church recognized Hoffman from the crime drama ‘Before the Devil Knows You're Dead’ where he played a drug-addicted swindler opposite Ethan Hawke.

‘She said, “I saw you in that movie last night and you were very, very bad!” And he said, “Look, even before I step into church I'm getting guilt!”’ Martin recalled.

In a tragic twist, it was the same church where Father Martin led the 46-year-old actor's funeral Mass Friday.

‘He was a lovely person, very down-to-earth,’ Martin told the magazine. ‘I learned about humility from him. He never put on airs.

The clergyman said that Hoffman would never boast about the films he was in or the major roles he landed, instead simply saying, ‘Yeah, I got this job.’

‘He would never say, “I'm the lead.” Or “I'm starring in ‘Capote,’’ Father Martin told People. ' Then I'd read about it in the papers and learn what it was.’

Marin, a worldly man with a keen sense of humor familiar to the viewers of The Colbert Report, where he is a frequent guest, described his late friend as someone who was fun to be around, but who was also very detail-oriented when it came to his work.

‘When you watched him act, you got a sense of what the word “vocation” really means,’ he said. He was born to do this.’

On Martin's public Facebook page, he described how during the filming of ‘Doubt’ he came on the set at Mount St. Vincent's College in Riverdale, New York, to watch Hoffman at work.

Deeming Hoffman’s performance in a scene where he delivers a homily as too reserved, Martin suggested that he be more forceful, so that even those sitting in the back row would feel the power of his words.

‘But when I saw the final cut of "Doubt" it dawned on me that he knew that the camera was close up, and a louder homily wouldn't have worked,’ Martin wrote in his tribute. ‘My sister said, "That's why he is the Oscar winner, and you're the Jesuit."

Father Martin also shared a photo of the original cast of ‘The Last Days of Judas Iscariot’ at the Public Theater a decade ago, where Hoffman is depicted wearing a sweatshirt that was given to all the participants of the production.

The front of the shirt features the definition of heaven offered by one of the play’s characters, who summed it up is as a place where you can ‘Eat Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes and Feel the Sun on Your Face.’

On Thursday, Hoffman, who fiercely 
protected his private life, was mourned behind closed doors in an 
emotional farewell from his close-knit family and loyal Hollywood 
friends.

Philip Seymour Hoffman, pictured in January, died of a suspected heroin  overdose at the age of 46 at his home in the West Village on Sunday

A private 
funeral for the Oscar-winning actor was held for 400 people at the 
Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, on a bright but bitterly cold day in 
Manhattan.

The actor's 
partner of 15 years Mimi O'Donnell looked devastated as she pulled her 
three children Cooper, 10, Tallulah, 7 and Willa, 5, close while they 
watched Hoffman's casket being carried in the church around midday.

Hundreds of mourners came to say 
goodbye at the Upper East Side church including Meryl Streep, Cate 
Blanchett, Joaquin Phoenix, Ethan Hawke, Michelle Williams, Amy 
Adams, Julianne Moore, Spike Lee, Louis C.K., Mary Louise Parker, Laura 
Linney, John Slattery, Jerry Stiller, Marisa Tomei, Ellen Burstyn, Ashley Olsen, Diane Sawyer and her director husband, Mike Nichols.

Hoffman, 46, was found dead on Sunday of 
an apparent heroin overdose in his West Village apartment. He had been open about a 
past that included drug addiction and rehab.

Most of those who attended the funeral
 had personal ties to Hoffman. He and Blanchett co-starred in The 
Talented Mr. Ripley and Hoffman starred in Spike Lee's The 25th Hour.

Jaoquin Phoenix shared the screen with Hoffman in The Master - as did Amy Adams.

Adams also appeared in the movie Doubt with Hoffman and Meryl Streep.

Burstyn and Hoffman were in Red Dragon and Hawke co-starred with Hoffman in Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.

Slattery directed Hoffman in his new film God's Pocket, and Nichols directed Hoffman on Broadway in Death of a Salesman. Julianne Moore was his co-star in the next installment of the Hunger Games triology. Laura Linney co-starred with Hoffman in The Savages.

Before the funeral, Hoffman's close friend, the writer David 
Bar Katz, looked distraught and tearful as he arrived with his family, getting a tight embrace from a friend on the steps of the church.

A larger memorial service is being 
planned for later this month. On Thursday evening, family and close 
friends gathered for a private wake at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral 
Home in Manhattan.

Hoffman
 was nominated for Academy Awards four times and won the Oscar for best 
actor in 2006 for his portrayal of writer Truman Capote in 'Capote.' He 
also was nominated three times for a Tony Award.

Broadway honored him on Wednesday night 
by dimming its lights for a minute, a memorial common for renowned stage
 actors. Thespians also gathered that night for a vigil.

'We come together tonight in a spirit of terrible mourning and incredible loss,' the Rev. Martin told the crowd of about 200 people who stood in a chilly drizzle. 'But we also come together to celebrate a remarkable life.'

'Courage was his forte, always,' said playwright and actor Eric Bogosian, a longtime LAByrinth collaborator. 'Phil set his bar on the highest rung, on a rung above the highest rung.

'He pushed himself relentlessly until finally his efforts virtually redefined the very endeavor we call acting. That's what he wanted. He wanted to rock the world.'

Hoffman, who was discovered on the floor of his bathroom on Sunday by his friend David Bar Katz, had been battling a relapse into drug and alcohol addiction for the best part of a year after being sober for more than two decades.

The star of The Hunger Games and Capote reportedly fell off the wagon during the wrap party for his 2012 movie, The Master and entered rehab in May of last year.

Hoffman, 46, who was widely respected as one of the best actors of his generation, was found with around 70 bags of heroin inside his apartment on Sunday after Ms O'Donnell phoned his friend Katz to check on him after he failed to collect their children at 9am.

More tests are needed to determine 
what exactly killed Hoffman, who was found with a syringe in his arm and
 what authorities said were dozens of packets of heroin in his 
apartment.

Autopsy results were inconclusive, authorities said this week.

Amid an investigation into Hoffman's death, three people have been arraigned on drug charges, including one who is facing a felony charge of heroin possession with intent to sell.

Lawyers for the three people charged vigorously denied their clients had any role in Hoffman's death.

The Church of St. Ignatius Loyola also hosted the funerals of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Lena Horne and Aaliyah.
