Timothy Zeman (above), 51, from Pacific, Missouri allegedly stole a tow truck to steal back his two vehicles from an impound lot

A man is accused of stealing a tow truck to steal back his two vehicles from an impound lot before leading police on a chase.

Timothy Zeman, 51, from Pacific, Missouri was accused of stealing a flatbed truck yesterday from Hyndrich Brothers Towing and then used it to retrieve his previously impounded cars from a different lot in Jefferson County.

He was chased by both sheriff's deputies and Missouri Highway Patrol before being arrested after driving into a bluff, said police.

Zeman has been charged with first-degree tampering and felony resisting arrest, and is being held in the Franklin County jail on a $50,000 bond, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch.

Deputies were able to determine the two cars being towed on the stolen wrecker belonged to Zeman - and believe he took them from the impound lot with the truck.

Zeman is said to have broken into the tow yard overnight.

He was seen by a deputy on Sunday who was traveling on Highway O, and spotted a tow truck matching the description of the missing wrecker reported in a call to the sheriff's office at 7am.

The wrecker arrived at a driveway on Highway O near the entrance of Red Barn Mobile Home Park.

As the deputy pulled behind the tow truck, Zeman reversed towards the police car before setting off and a slow-speed pursuit ensued.

While the deputy gave chase, he threw items out of the window, according to the sheriff's office.

The deputy was joined in the chase by Missouri Highway Patrol and a second deputy involved attempted to stop the fleeing vehicle by placing spikes in front of the wrecker's tires on St Louis Rock Road, according to KMOV. 

He allegedly took the wrecker from Hyndrich Brothers Towing and then led police on a chase (a truck from the towing company pictured above)

However the attempt was unsuccessful as Zeman continued with deflated front tires as he headed onto Highway 100 toward Washington. 

Police in Washington were informed to stop traffic traveling east and deputies drove westbound in front of the truck to warn oncoming traffic.

Zeman fled to Elizabeth Ann Drive before he crashed into a bluff. He refused to come out of the vehicle and had to be forcibly taken out, and was placed in custody.

He has been investigated for auto theft, felony resisting arrest and several traffic charges that are impending.

The drama began overnight when Zeman broke into a tow yard, according to police (above)

Zeman was spotted by a deputy on Sunday who was traveling on Highway O, and recognized a tow truck matching the description of the missing wrecker reported in a call to the sheriff's office at 7am

He has been charged with first-degree tampering and felony resisting arrest, and he is being held in the Franklin County jail on a $50,000 bond
