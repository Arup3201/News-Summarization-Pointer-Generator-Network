A worker at a meat rendering plant allegedly stabbed his colleague to death a day after he pulled a chair out from underneath him, police have revealed. 

Peter Atem has been accused of knifing Danny Vazquez, 25, to death at the MOPAC plant in Franconia Township near Philadelphia on Wednesday, before slicing his own neck.

Witnesses said that as the father-of-three lay dying, he uttered the words: 'Tell my wife I love her.'

The 32-year-old was found hiding in a shed along with a note which read: 'You think you can destroyed my life in front of my family, friends and the all world and lived... See you in hell. Life for life.' 

Atem was airlifted to hospital where his condition is unknown. 

He has been charged with murder after an alleged dispute between them reached boiling point.

Witnesses told the Allentown Morning Call that Atem was out to get Mr Vazquez after the chair prank.

The next day while the men were working, Atem attacked and choked Mr Vazquez, police said.

Vazquez managed to escape his grasp but later in the day witnesses heard a scream and found him collapsed on the floor. 

According to his Facebook page, Mr Vazquez graduated from Kensington High School and would post about football, most recently about the Super Bowl, but he never mentioned anything about problems at work. 

He is believed to have recently bought a house in Northern Philadelphia for his wife and three children.  

A criminal complaint stated Atem is from Sudan and has no history of violence.  

Heartbreaking: Witnesses said that as the father of three lay dying, he uttered the words: 'Tell my wife (Johely pictured right) I love her.'

Boiling point: Workers said Vazquez and Atem had been involved in a back-and-forth dispute for months
