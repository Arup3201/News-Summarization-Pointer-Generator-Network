Courtney Love has said she is responsible for the note mocking her wedding vows to grunge rocker Kurt Cobain which was unearthed last week, some 20 years after his death.

Police found the note in Cobain's wallet
 after he killed himself in 1994. It received a lot of media attention 
last week after CBS News published it, saying it was presumably written 
by Cobain and that it was sure to stoke questions about what role his 
marriage played in his death.

One of the foremost experts on Cobain, Seattle author Charles R. Cross, posted a blog entry on Friday explaining that he has received an email from Love explaining that she had written the note and given it to Cobain before their wedding in 1991.

Love notes: Cobain's biographer says Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love often wrote mocking love notes to each other, and that the handwriting in this note is 'absolutely Courtney's'

'Early in their relationship, they wrote
 notes like that to each other constantly. The handwriting is absolutely
 Courtney's,' said Cross, who has written several books on Cobain, 
including the biography 'Heavier Than Heaven.'

The note references Love as Cobain's 'lawful shredded wife' who would be 'siphoning' his money for drugs.

'The note was promoted as Kurt mocking their wedding vows three years after they were married. It just doesn't make any sense,' Cross said.

Cross said the couple often wrote each other such sarcastic notes.

Love's sister, Nicole Jon Carroll, and an unnamed former Cobain estate employee who had examined journals for Cobain and Love have backed Love's statement, write Cross in his blog entry.

Cobain's body was discovered in Seattle on April 8, 1994. An investigation determined that days earlier Cobain had gone into the greenhouse of his home and taken a massive dose of heroin. He then shot himself with a 20-gauge shotgun.

Earlier this year, in advance of the 
20th anniversary of Cobain's suicide, a Seattle detective reviewed the 
case files, including evidence photos and statements. He found no new 
information to change the police conclusion that Cobain took his own 
life.

Cobain, who was 27 when he died, sold millions of albums with Nirvana and helped popularize the Pacific Northwest's heavy, muddy grunge rock. Nirvana was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last month.

Courtney 
Love's own father has made the sensational claim that his daughter was 
responsible for the death of Nirvana star Kurt Cobain - and says he has evidence.

Hank
 Harrison, the ex-manager of the Grateful Dead, said that while he can't
 prove his daughter pulled the trigger on the shotgun that ended the 
grunge star's life 20 -years ago, he 'can prove her involvement to a 
high degree of certainty.'

Harrison,
 who is estranged from his rock-star daughter said that he became 
convinced she killed her own husband after the Seattle police released a
 note that Cobain held in his wallet mocking his wedding vows that 
called his wife a 'b***h with zits'.

Harrison told RadarOnline.com that he believes his 49-year-old daughter was complicit in her husband's death.

Updated: Hank Harrison has said that his book Love Kills: The Assassination of Kurt Cobain will be republished to include the proof of his daughters involvement

He is planning to publish his proof in his upcoming republished book, Love Kills: The Assassination of Kurt Cobain.

The final clue that sealed his opinion was the handwritten note inside the music legends wallet.

'Do you Kurt Cobain take Courtney Michelle Love to be your lawful shredded wife,' the note begins, 'even when she’s a b**ch with zits and siphoning all (your) money for doping and whoring.'

Harrison, who is also suspicious of the Seattle police's motives for only releasing new evidence 20-years on, said that the note is key.

'If you read the true meaning of this small note, and place it in conjunction with the rest of the evidence, anyone with even half a wit will see that something dire and awful took place,' Harrison alleges.

Indeed, his criticism of the Seattle police is strident.

'Nobody, except me, asked the obvious question: ‘Why weren’t they developed 20 years ago?’ he added to RadarOnline.

'They weren’t developed because the police had already decided it was a suicide and didn’t need any more evidence.'

Hank and Courtney's fractious relationship mirrored that of his with her mother Linda Carroll.

The pair were hanging out together and tripping on LSD when their daughter, Courtney Michelle Harrison was born in 1964.

They soon split and Love never became close with her father who specializes in medieval and Celtic history.

The
 brief contact they did have was when he would mail her packages of of 
LSD and Ecstasy when she was living in Liverpool, England as a teenager.

Harrison
 is banned from seeing Kurt and Courtney's daughter Frances Bean Cobain 
and has been concerned his daughter killed her own husband for years.

'She's
 a psychopath, she has a sociopathic personality like I do. I don't know
 who killed him. I know who benefited from his death: my daughter, for 
one,' said Harrison to NBC's Dateline in 2004.
