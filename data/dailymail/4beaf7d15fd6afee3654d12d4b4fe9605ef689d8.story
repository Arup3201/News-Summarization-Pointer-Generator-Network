She is one of the most sought-after models in the business, even after 25 years, and any brand would be proud to bag her for a campaign.

Now one shoe brand has gone a step further than using Kate Moss as their billboard face, managing to persuade the notoriously reserved model to smile and even speak in their new fashion video.

Moss, 39, is seen talking on the phone in the back of a chauffeur-driven car in a clip for American shoe designer Stuart Weitzman.

To the soundtrack of the iconic Nancy Sinatra Made For Walking song, Moss is captured turning heads as she walks through the streets of London in a selection of stylish footwear as the face of the brand's autumn/winter campaign.

Retro looking over-the-knee styles are paired with one of her trademark shaggy furs, while smart, patent styles are worn with head-to-toe black.

The supermodel turns heads as eccentric transvestite beauticians, schoolchildren, kissing couples and elderly fashionistas all stop to gawp at her fabulous self as she struts confidently through town. 

Moss says 'there's loads of traffic', 'I'm going to walk', and 'see you in a bit' while on the phone

The stylish black and white clip, directed by independent filmmaker Balthazar Klarwein, mimicks the look and style of 1960s street photography.

It premiered at Milan Fashion Week yesterday at the opening of the brand’s new Milan flagship store designed by Zaha Hadid.
