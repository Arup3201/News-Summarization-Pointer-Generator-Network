Andy Murray took to the courts at Roland Garros as the British No 1 stepped up his preparations for the French Open.

With the second Grand Slam of the year due to begin on Sunday, Murray trained on the clay of Paris on Wednesday under the watchful eye of assistant coach Dani Vallverdu.

Murray is still searching for a permanent coach to replace Ivan Lendl despite having initially hoped to appoint a new mentor before the French Open gets underway.

Murray will be seeded No 7 in Friday's 
draw and could face Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic or Roger Federer at the quarter-final stage.

After a patchy start to the year, his performance in a tight three-set defeat to Nadal in the last eight of the Rome Masters last week will give him confidence that he can challenge in Paris.

It is his first appearance at Roland Garros for two years, having missed last year's tournament due to a back injury.

Murray's
 best performance at the French Open was in 2011 when he reached the 
semi-finals, losing in straight sets to eventual champion Nadal.
