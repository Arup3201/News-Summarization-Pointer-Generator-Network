Women who are trying for a baby should tuck into a regular helping of Brussels sprouts, an expert has claimed

Many people shudder at the thought of Brussels sprouts, with their minds conjuring up images of bitter, overcooked school vegetables.

But new research suggests that couples who are trying for a baby should tuck into a regular helping of the festive staple.

According to studies, nine per cent of all conceptions take place over the Christmas period, making December the most fertile month of the year.

Parties and festive tipples are thought to be partly responsible for this trend.

However, Neema Savvides, a nutritional therapist at the Harley Street Fertility Clinic, says the increased consumption of sprouts could also play a role.

She said: ‘Believe it or not, this green micro cabbage is a baby making super food. 

‘Firstly, they are bursting with folic acid which is essential for boosting fertility in both men and women. 

‘This vitamin rich source also increases sperm levels and helps line the womb with the right nutrients raising sperm survival chances.

‘Another benefit of this folic rich food is that it also helps to decrease the risk of miscarriages and birth defects.’

Nine per cent of all conceptions take place over the Christmas period, making December the most fertile month of the year - this is partly due to the number of parties and the increased alcohol consumption

Brussels sprouts also contain a phytonutrient called di-indolylmethane, which helps women absorb balanced levels of the hormone oestrogen.

In fact, it binds to environmental oestrogens, like pesticides and hormones in meat and dairy products, and helps rid the body of excess hormones – this boosts fertility. 

The vegetable is also thought to lower cholesterol levels and have anti-inflammatory properties.
