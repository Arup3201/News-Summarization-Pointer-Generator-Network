It seems right that different cultures would adapt Santa to suit their own traditions.

But when the finished product involves riding a Harley Davidson, dressing in a slick zoot suit and sporting a sombrero you know that your Santa has the cool factor.

Meet Pancho Claus, the Tex Mex Santa who usually has black hair, a black beard or sometimes just a moustache.

Like Santa, he wears a hat — though often it's a sombrero. He dons a serape or a poncho and, in one case, a red and black zoot suit.

Pancho Claus likes to make an entrance wherever he goes too, usually on a lowrider or Harley Davidson, led by a pack of burros instead of eight reindeer.

The tradition comes from the Chicano civil rights movement, and Pancho Claus is mostly based in Texas US.

Lorenzo Cano, a Mexican-American studies scholar at the University of Houston, says Pancho was apparently conceived north of the border as Mexican-Americans looked to 'build a place and a space for themselves' in the 1970s.

His rise coincided with a growing interest in Mexican art, Cinco de Mayo, Mexican Independence Day and other cultural events.

Each of the Panchos has a unique local flavour, and the tradition is adored across Texas.

Some
 historians believe that the tradition is set to spread to other parts 
of the US too, with Panchos being spotted in California already.

In the West Texas plains, Pancho Claus is known as Pancho Clos.

Julian Perez, a 71-year-old retired heating and air conditioning 
repairman, has been Lubbock Texas' Pancho for 30 years and remembers when 
three men, all of whom have since died, first came up with the idea.

Mr Perez, who wears a long salt-and-pepper beard, 
oversized sombrero and colorful poncho when he assumes the role of 
Pancho, said: 'I
 wanted to quit, but I just can't. It just makes me want to do something
 for the kids.'

Robert Narvaiz, vice commander for Lubbock's American GI Forum and coordinator of that city's Pancho project, said: 'Pancho Claus comes from the South Pole, and Santa Claus comes from the North Pole, and every year they get together here in Lubbock.

'Santa ... was he Anglo? Was he black? Was he Hispanic? I guess everybody is trying to do the same thing: Add a little of their own culture.'

This city's Pancho dates to 1971, when the local American GI Forum decided to infuse a little Hispanic culture into Santa.

They gave him a sombrero and serape, and held a big party at a park, giving out candy and fruit to 3,000 children.

Today, Pancho visits schools, churches and supermarkets, but the biggest event — now supported by three different car clubs and dozens of bikers — remains the party at Rogers Park. There, on the Sunday before Christmas, Pancho hands out gifts.

In Houston Texas Pancho wears a signature red and black zoot suit, fedora hat and waves to children from the back of a lowrider.

Richard Reyes, 62, transformed into Pancho in the early 1980s, blending his interests in theater with his Hispanic heritage and a desire to work with at-risk, low-income children.

He took on the mission after his teenage sister was killed in a drive-by shooting.

Reyes put his own spin on Pancho, and started producing a short show that that eventually grew into a play with a 10-piece band and hip-hop dancers.

Many of the performers were enlisted by Mr Reyes who met them while working in detention and community centres.

He said: 'It's grown amazingly.

'Now we give out hundreds of toys, if not thousands, with other agencies and we also have a big Christmas Eve party for about 300 families ... and then on Christmas Day itself we actually go to the barrios with lowrider cars with sirens blaring ... and give out toys there.'

In San Antonio Texas Pancho wears a sombrero and serape.

He spends the festive season hanging out at  River Walk, and poses in front of the Alamo.

His gifts are carried in a cart pulled by trusty 'burritos.'

Forget Rudolph's red nose. A head donkey named "Chuy" leads the way for this Claus.

In San Antonio, Pancho visits schools and churches to hand out gifts and turkeys with all the trimmings to 50 low-income families.

And Pancho, portrayed by Rudy Martinez, has grown so popular he even has a public information officer.

His spokesman Patrick Resendez, said: 'The end result is putting a smile on their face.'
