A devoted husband has written his wife a love letter every single day for almost forty years, because he's 'crazy about her'.

Bill Bresnan, 74, from Toms River, New Jersey, has penned more than 10,000 of the notes as a constant expression of his affection for Kirsten, also 74.

Even when the couple are apart, Bresnan makes sure to mail the cards ahead of time to wherever she's going to be.

Leafing through: The couple has kept every single letter and can look back on them to see what they were doing

Love letter: Above is one of the messages, dated June 1990, where Bresnan invites his wife on a boating trip

The pair met in 1974, when Kirsten enrolled in a finance class her husband-to-be was teaching. The letters, sporadic at first, soon followed.

'I'd mail a card from Chicago, a note from Los Angeles, a napkin from a restaurant in Boston. Into her scrapbook they went, and the collection took on a life of its own', he wrote in the Asbury Park Press.

Since they married, the ritual became embedded, and Bresnan claims to have never missed a single day.

'I'm crazy about her - that's the only way I can describe it', he told ABC News.

The huge cache of sentimental writings, each signed with two kisses and an infinity symbol, is now stored in 25 neatly-filed boxes in the couple's attic.

Storage: There are now so many letters that the Bresnans store the huge mass of love notes in their attic

Chronological: Thanks to meticulous record-keeping, the cards are organised in date order, and chronicle four decades

As well as keeping their relationship strong day-by-day, the chronological collection also offers them a window into the past.

Bresnan said: 'They're essentially a love diary. For example, I could pick out a day in 1982, and it’ll begin with the restaurant we ate in or a movie we saw and then a reaction to that.' 

Even major obstacles, such as when both Bresnan, and later his wife, were diagnosed with cancer, have not broken the daily tradition.

Kirsten, who often writes letters back to her husband 'not every day, but very often', says that the ever-growing collection 'mean everything to me'.

According to Bresnan, his romantic formula is part of his efforts to keep his marriage as strong as possible. He told ABC: 'The key to any relationship is that you both have to work at it every day.'

'And never go to bed mad. Talk about everything. Everything should get resolved before your goodnight kiss.'
