Chitwood said the holidays bring more attempts to mail drugs.  

'It's the Christmas season, more and more packages are being delivered so more and more attempts are being made to deliver whether it's cocaine, heroin and marijuana,' said.

Authorities are also working with California police to identify the package's sender.
