A hardworking mechanic and his new bride have been shot dead outside their Delaware home.

Joseph and Olga Connell were shot multiple times in front of the Paladin Club Condominiums in Wilmington around 1:30 a.m. Sunday as they returned from celebrating a friend's birthday.

Mr Connell, 39, was pronounced dead at the scene while his older wife Olga, 46, was rushed to Wilmington Hospital where she succumbed to her injuries. The couple, who met online, were married in June in a small ceremony in the Virgin Islands.

Tragic: Joseph and Olga Connell, both 39, pictured, died after they were shot multiple times in front of the Paladin Club Condominiums in Edgemoor around 1:30 a.m. Sunday

New Castle County Police responded to reports of shots fired at the condominiums and found the victims laying in a pool of blood out the front.

Bullet holes could be seen in the doorway of the building where the couple lived and the window was smashed, indicating a violent confrontation.

A neighbor told CBS News he had heard a man shout loudly before gunshots rang out in the early hours of Sunday morning.

'It shocked me when I heard about it,' he said.

Another neighbor, Seymour Waxman, said he couldn't believe the double homicide had occurred.

'It was two very nice people and they're gone. I can't believe that,' he said.

Met online: Mrs Connell, left, was originally from Russia and traveled to the US with her former husband before they split. She met Mr Connell, right, online

Mr Connell owned his own auto repair shop, C&S Automotive Services in Talleyville, and Mrs Connell worked there as the receptionist.

'They were a really, really nice couple,' customer Pat Schierbaum told DelawareOnline, as she stood outside the business on Monday.

Police believe the murders are not random but have not released any more details.

No arrests have been made and no information is available on any possible suspect or motive.

Schierbaum said when she was at the shop about six weeks ago, Olga had mentioned someone had burglarized their home and stolen her jewelry.

Police have not confirmed the burglary report.

Crime scene: New Castle County police officers were called to the Paladin Club Apartments in Edgemoor, pictured, just before 1:30 a.m. Sunday and found the newlyweds in a pool of blood

Evidence: Officers and a canine unit searched for the shooter immediately after the frightening attack but were unsuccessful. Investigators spent 12 hours scouring the scene for evidence

Officers and a canine unit searched for the shooter immediately after the frightening attack but were unsuccessful.

Investigators spent more than 12 hours collecting evidence and interviewing nearby residents and a detective sat behind the front counter of the Connell's business on Sunday, reviewing documents.

'Forensically we are on the verge of at least knowing what happened,' county police Chief Elmer Setting told DelawareOnline.

Mr Connell's family took to Facebook to express their despair at the death of the newlyweds.

According to ABC News, the two met online and their family described the union as love at first sight. Mrs Connell was originally from Russia and had moved to America with her ex-husband before the pair divorced.

The couple had been at a friend's birthday party on Saturday evening.

Hardworker: Joseph Connell's partner said through tears the 39-year-old was a hard worker and that he knew no one who would want to hurt him

Receptionist: Olga Connell, pictured, worked as a receptionist at her husband's auto repair shop

'This is hard. I have never felt pain like this before. Joey, I love you so much,' his sister, Kelly Connell wrote on Facebook on Monday.

'I will never stop missing you. I will never stop thinking about you! Your little sister really needs you! :( RIP JOEY AND OLGA. I want to hear you laugh again. I want to see you smile again. I want to awake from this nightmare.'

His distraught business partner, Chris Rivers, told ABC News through tears: 'He was a great guy. He worked hard. He came to work every day.'

He added that he had last seen Mr Connell on Friday but spoke to him on the phone on Saturday and everything seemed fine. He said he didn't know of anyone who would want to hurt him.

Police are continuing their investigation into the homicides.
