John Galliano stepped out yesterday sporting a rather more relaxed look than usual.

The controversial designer was seen at LAX airport in a bohemian style outfit including gladiator sandals with long green socks.

The 52-year old is concentrating on rebuilding his reputation since being fired from the house 
of Dior after an anti-Semitic rant was caught on camera a few years ago.

His eponymous Paris catwalk show and a recent collaboration with Oscar de la Renta both met with rave reviews and today it was confirmed that the English designer will take up a teaching role at the famous Parsons design school in New York.

John Galliano left LAX airport yesterday looking very bohemian and sporting pink glasses

The designer wore a rather mis-matched ensemble including gladiator sandals with long socks and a brightly striped woollen poncho over a jacquard jacket and T shirt, finished off with a baggy overcoat

Obviously opting for comfort on his flight, Galliano wore an over-sized khaki raincoat with a black trim, over a colourful jacquard jacket over a purple t-shirt underneath.

He also sported army camouflage shorts and a brightly coloured woolen poncho, secured with a toggle clasp.

The unconventional look was completed with a baggy beanie hat over his now long hair, and pink sunglasses.

News that the designer will be taking a teaching role at Parsons The New School for Design in New York has delighted fashion students there.

The master class will include a three-day workshop that will be taught by Galliano with the final 
critique reportedly given by Galliano and Parsons Dean Simon Collins.

According to Fashionista.com seniors in Parsons’s BFA fashion program received an email this weekend about a new course titled 'Show Me Emotion.' The course description says that it seeks to 'engage its participants by provoking the power of emotion in context of fashion practice and exploration of intuitive, perceptive manners of investigational making.'

Dis Magazine published
the full letter Parsons sent out to students which describes the course
as: 'a master of tailoring, construction, research, and thematic 
investigation, John Galliano is an unparalleled living legend capable of
blending and blurring the traditional boundaries of practice. A 
technical genius, after more than twenty-five years of practice, what 
inspires him most today is not a destination of a geographical sense but
the divergent journeys of the soul,mind, and reflection. Feeling, 
thinking, perceiving, and responding shape his current creative identity
and he allows emotion to determine the depth of a collar, the volume 
between body and sleeve.'

While always an eccentric dresser, 
Galliano’s recent ‘off duty’ look is a far cry from the super sleek, 
high fashion outfits he wore while chief designer at Dior.

He
has been seen dressed down numerous times over the last month, and 
ignited criticism when one of his outfits appeared to be attempting to 
copy the attire of Hasidic Jews - a claim Galliano vigorously denied.

Galliano enjoyed a three week stint under Oscar de la Renta in the run up to New York Fashion week in Febuary, as the fashion elite, including Vogue editor Anna Wintour rallied around him to help with his come back.

Mr de la Renta, 80, has insisted that Mr Galliano is one of the most talented men he has ever met.
