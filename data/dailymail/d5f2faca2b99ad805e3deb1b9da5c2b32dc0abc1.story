A short-sighted woman is suing high street optical chain Optical Express for £1million claiming that laser surgery ruined her dream of becoming a policewoman. 

Stephanie Holloway, 28,  spent £2,900 to improve her vision because her poor eyesight was preventing her from fulfilling her ambition to join the police, a court heard.

But the procedure went disastrously wrong and has left her so sensitive to light she has to wear sun glasses in the shower, it was claimed.

She wears dark-tinted glasses almost all the time and her mother has to act as her guide when she goes outdoors, Central London County Court heard.

She is suing DMC Optical Ltd, the company behind high street laser surgery chain, Optical Express, as well as the surgeon who carried out the operation, Dr Joanna McGraw.

Her lawyers value her damages for pain, suffering and loss of earnings at £1million. 

Nicholas Yell, Miss Holloway's barrister, told the judge she was 21 and working as a buyer for an antiquarian books dealer when she decided to have the photo-refractive keratectomy procedure at the Southampton branch of Optical Express. 

Over the last few years, laser eye surgery has become a mainstream treatment for poor eyesight.  

A whole host of celebrities, including Cilla Black, Spice Girl Mel B, Nicole Kidman and Brad Pitt, have had the operation.

Laser eye surgery works by removing tissue from the cornea to change its shape. There are different types of laser eye surgery but LASIK - which stands for Laser-Assisted In-Situ Keratomileusis - is the most common.

The procedure involves applying anaesthetic drops, after which a small flap is made on the surface of the cornea using a hand-held femtosecond laser device. 

The vast majority of operations pass off with no ill-effects.

There are many advantages: there is little or no pain, recovery is quick and both eyes can be treated at once.

However, the cutting of the flap requires skill and in one to four per cent of cases, this can cause problems. 

The flap can be damaged or even lost; stray particles can get trapped under the flap; there is a minor risk of infection; there is even a small risk of penetration of the eye by the very fine surgical blade used to cut the flap, which could potentially cause blindness. 

The other problem is that, apart from being a doctor, no specialist qualifications are legally required to carry out laser eye surgery.  

He said: 'The procedure was intended to improve or correct her myopia. She wanted to join the police force.'

Mr Yell said she was left with severe photophobia by the laser procedure in February 2008, which is an extreme sensitivity to bright light. It means she has to wear dark glasses the majority of the time.

He added: 'She is in a considerably worse position than before treatment and  is visually disabled.' 

He also said she had developed clinical depression as a result.  

Mr Yell went on to say there was a failure by Dr McGraw to properly explain the treatment to Miss Holloway and warn her of the risks. 

From the witness box, Miss Holloway, of Lee-on-Solent, in Hampshire, said she had lost her job in the antique books trade and could not find alternative employment because her vision was so impaired. 

She said: 'I was in a good position in my life. I loved to read and I loved to look at art. I was unaware of the risks and I was never told of any of the risks.'

She went to explain that, post surgery, her eyes were so bad she couldn't cook for fear of burning herself and needed help to go outside and dress herself. 

But, Simon Cridland, representing Optical Express, put to Miss Holloway that she was clearly warned by Dr McGraw she risked being left with 'a very bad result' because of the type of eyes she had.

He also claimed that Miss Holloway was exaggerating her post-operative visual difficulties.

The hearing involving laser surgery  that went wrong is being heard at Central London County Court, sitting at the Royal Courts of Justice (above)

'You were able to see sufficiently well in 2011, and now, to dress yourself,' Mr Cridland said, accusing her 'putting it on' and 'grossly exaggerating' her problems.

Mr Cridland told the judge that video surveillance evidence 'entirely contradicted' her claims about the extent of her visual disability.

Outside court, Miss Holloway's mother, Heather Brace, said: 'The laser eye surgery business is not properly regulated and anybody can walk in off the streets like my daughter and have their life ruined.

'Of course accidents happen, but people need to know the risks.'

The hearing continues.
