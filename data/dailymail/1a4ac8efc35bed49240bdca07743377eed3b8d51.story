Arrest: Teaching assistant Cody Cousins is being held in connection with the fatal shooting

A teaching assistant was shot dead at Indiana's Purdue University Tuesday, leading to a campus lock down as police searched for the gunman.

The suspected shooter, Cody Cousins is believed to have deliberately targeted the victim, named as university teaching assistant Andrew Boldt, before handing himself into police.

Mr Boldt, 21, was shot in the university's electrical engineering building at around noon.

Police said the alleged 23-year-old gunman, from Centerville, Ohio, put up no resistance when he was arrested shortly after reports of gunfire were made. 

Officers were seen raiding a home believed to belong to Cousins, near the Indiana campus, at about 4pm Tuesday.

Police
 Chief John Cox told Heavy that the shooting was not random and that 
Cousins, who was also a teaching assistant, has been 
arrested in connection with it.

Although they were both from the same department, it was not clear how well Cousins and Mr Boldt knew each other.

They both shared the same professor, David Meyer, although for different classes.

Police chief John Cox told JC Online there had been 'little to no cooperation with the individual we took into custody'.

The shooting took place in a basement classroom of the electrical engineering building, and police confirmed no other suspects were being sought.

Student Nick Wieland said he was in a neighboring classroom when he heard gunfire.

'I heard a couple [shots] and then I heard a man scream,' Mr Wieland said. '[I was] just very scared. That’s what I felt the entire time.'

Shut down: Police locked down the campus and took one suspect into custody from one of the electrical engineering buildings

A vigil is due to be held for Mr Boldt, who was from Wisconsin, on campus at about 8pm tonight.

The
 ambitious undergraduate teaching assistant had been highly praised 
during his time at two electrical engineering internships.

On
 campus, he had been president of the Cary Racing - Purdue Grand Prix 
from 2011 to 2013, and was on the executive council of the computing and
 electrical engineering student society.

As reports of the shooting were announced, 'shelter-in-place' warnings were put in place across campus.

By mid-afternoon the warnings had been lifted from the West 
Lafayette, Indiana campus with the exception of the electrical 
engineering building where the shooting took place.

The suspect allegedly walked into the electrical engineering building while armed and targeted Mr Boldt.

The shooter then left the building and allegedly turned himself in to a West Lafayette city police officer with no resistance.

'Shooting reported on campus; Bldg. 
Electrical Engineering; avoid area; shelter in place,' the school wrote 
on their Twitter account, ending with a link to the school website.

That
 Twitter update was sent out at 12.30pm to their more than 34,800,000 
followers and just over ten minutes later, they reported that a suspect 
was in custody.

Students told local paper The Journal & Courier that they heard gunshots and believed that two shots may have been fired.

David Boudia, one of the best-known 
Purdue alums who won a gold medal during the 2012 Olympic games for 
diving, has been tweeting throughout the incident and posted a photo of 
what appears to be a man being taken into custody while being surrounded
 by armed police officers.

He also tweeted claims a second shooter had been taken into custody from a different building, and another student on the campus tweeted a similar statement.

Those reports were later refuted by school officials who said there was only one shooter, who was already in police custody.

Free to move: The 'shelter in place' warning was lifted from all other buildings before finally being removed from the electrical engineering building which is now closed and considered a crime scene

Purdue officials issued a text alert telling those on the
campus about 60 miles northwest of Indianapolis to seek shelter shortly after
the shooting was reported.

Responding with force: The local police and SWAT teams were on the scene within minutes

Within two hours, the university said there was no ongoing
threat on campus and allowed normal operations to resume in all buildings
except the engineering facility.

Students described a chaotic scene when the first report
came in.

Julissa Martinez, a freshman nursing student from Portage,
said she was in psychology class on another part of campus when she received
the text message saying the university was on lockdown.

She said her professor
briefly kept teaching, then stopped lecturing so that students could contact
people to let them know they were safe.

'He tried to get everything under control because people
were freaking out,' she said.

She said students were nervous because there was a lot of
speculation about the severity of the situation.

'It was scary because you hear about it, but you never
expect it to happen on your campus,' Martinez said.

Senior Saran Mishra, editor of the Purdue Exponent, the
campus newspaper, said some students reported hearing fire alarms and were told
to evacuate.

'Right now I'm still in shock,' he said.
