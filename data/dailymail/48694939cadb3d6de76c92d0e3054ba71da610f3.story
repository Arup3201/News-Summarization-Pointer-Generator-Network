Fernando Alonso is hopeful Jenson Button will be on the Formula One grid next year, despite being tipped to replace the McLaren driver.

Alonso's deal to re-join the British team, who he he left so acrimoniously in 2007, is all but done and could be announced before the season finale in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight's time.

The Ferrari driver is expected to take over from Button with the McLaren hierarchy likely to stick with rookie Kevin Magnussen.

But Button's cause to be partnered alongside Alonso was aided by a strong performance in Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix after he finished fourth. He now has 106 points this season in comparison to the 55 scored by team-mate Magnussen.

'Hopefully he will stay', said Alonso, 'He is a very talented driver, a great character and good person. People like him are good for our sport.

'Whether we will see him on the grid, you need to ask McLaren.'

Button sealed his fourth-placed finish with an exquisite passing move around the outside of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen.

Asked whether he was ready to leave the sport after 15 years, Button said: 'Not ready to stop racing no. 'That is all I can do right now, go out and enjoy my racing and I loved it today. 

'You have good days, you have bad days when you are in a situation like I am mentally, but I don’t think any of the days on circuit have been negative, they have always been positive and I am going strong so I am happy.'
