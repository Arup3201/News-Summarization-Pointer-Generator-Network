Fury: Chris Tarrant, pictured with girlfriend Jane Bird, has told of his anger at the breakin

Chris Tarrant has spoken of his anger after burglars targeted his mother’s house only days after she died.

They took heirlooms including jewellery, silver cutlery and vases. They also stole bottles of wine, her television and even her coat.

Tarrant was with Joan, 93, when she died at home in April.

He had suspected thieves were watching her £400,000 detached home, which was on a quiet street in Reading, Berkshire.

The burglars struck before Mrs Tarrant’s funeral and before the presenter was able to start the emotional task of clearing her home.

The 65-year-old said: ‘They are b***ards. They knew very well it was an elderly lady who had died.’

Neighbour Paul Roberts, 64, said: ‘The burglary clearly upset Chris because I did speak to him when he came round to the house to sort out his mum’s possessions.

‘He was very upset. I just said to him it must have been particularly difficult since the house would have had a lot of memories for him too – he did live there for a few years too.

‘Joan was a lovely lady and she was a fighter till the very end. She was an amazing woman with a lot of strength.

‘It’s outrageous what those burglars did, especially since it was coming up to the funeral itself.’  The  Thames Valley Police spokesman said officers were called to the property nine days after Mrs  Tarrant’s death.

They said the culprits had not yet been caught and police are appealing for information about the incident.

Tarrant’s father, Basil, died seven years ago.

Earlier this year the presenter, an only child, revealed how close he was to his parents in the Channel 5 show War Hero In My Family.

He said: ‘My father was my best friend. We did everything together.

‘My mother was a kind soul who never told a lie in her life. Not one. I said that at her funeral. They were my heroes.’

Basil Tarrant was an infantry major in the Second World War and received the Military Cross for his bravery.

While researching the programme about his father’s life, Tarrant discovered he had killed German  soldiers during house-to-house fighting in a night patrol in Kleve, a border town between Germany and the Netherlands.

‘My jokey, lovely dad killing people with a bayonet or with his bare hands.

‘And then he came home and went back to the Huntley, Boorne &  Stevens biscuit tin factory and never spoke about it.

‘Finding that out blew my mind,’ Tarrant said.

His discoveries also made him  re-evaluate his relationship with his four children – two from his first marriage and two with ex-wife Ingrid.

He said: ‘I’m not a great dad because in the early years I worked too hard and didn’t see the kids enough.

‘After the break-up with Ingrid they weren’t fond of their father. But these days I know what counts. I keep promises.

‘The death of parents gives you perspective. Now I know my greatest achievements are my children.

‘There’s no gong, media success or a million-quid cheque that beats that.’

He said his relationship with Ingrid is not quite so successful.

‘We haven’t had a conversation for years. It’s a shame. I do hope it all sorts itself out one day.’

The marriage collapsed spectacularly in 2006 after Ingrid hired a private detective who discovered that Tarrant had been having a decade-long affair with primary school deputy head Fiona McKechnie.

Now Tarrant lives a much quieter life with girlfriend Jane Bird, and says he has not been so happy for a long time.

‘She’s an Essex girl and a lovely lady. She’d come out and stay on my 40-acre place in the country in high heels and say: “What am I doing here?”

‘She didn’t like the country uniform – wellies and Barbour. Now she indulges my country ways. Especially fishing.

‘Would I marry her? No. The reason we are together is because we like each other.

‘She doesn’t want to either. It puts pressure on. She’s just a mate.’
