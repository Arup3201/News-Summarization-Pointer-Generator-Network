Frantically hunting for your mobile phone to answer a call may soon be a thing of the past.

Scientists have developed a sensor, worn on the wrist like a watch, which allows the wearer to control any electronic device with a simple wave of the hand.

The gadget uses a minute camera to track hand movements and can recognise specific gestures, which it translates into commands – such as a thumbs up to answer the phone.

A new technology developed by Newcastle University and Microsoft Research Cambridge can let users control their TV and even mobile phone simply by moving their hand

Because it does not rely on fixed external sensors, such as those found on games consoles, it can be used outside the home.

And, as it connects wirelessly with 
other electronic equipment, users can control items such as mobile 
phones without holding them – even if they are in a bag or another room.

But it cannot do everything – users 
will have to use a headset or earphones to have a conversation if their 
mobile is not within reach.

The project, called Digits, was 
developed by researchers at Newcastle University and Microsoft Research 
Cambridge. The scientists say it could even allow people to use cash 
machines and chip and PIN devices more securely by entering their 
information from inside their pocket.

The gadget would let wearers control their phone and TV simply by moving their hand

The sensor can track a user’s 
fingertip movements in the dark, reading them as if they were typing on a
 keypad before transmitting the code to the bank’s device.

The researchers said one of the 
biggest advantages of the device is that it leaves the hand free – 
unlike the data gloves which are often worn to interact with virtual 
reality applications.

Patrick Olivier, a professor of human-computer 
interaction at Newcastle University who has worked on the prototype, 
said: ‘It allows you to use everyday gestures or move your fingers to 
interact with a whole host of electronic devices and not just in the 
home. It is more than just a remote control, in the future everyone 
would have just one wrist-sensor to control all their gadgets.

‘The idea is that you programme it to 
recognise a hand movement, such as turning a knob, and this will then 
control the volume on the device it is connected to. Or a thumbs up 
could answer the phone – the user can choose any gesture that suits 
them.’

The sensor straps to a user's wrist, and monitors the movement of their hand looking for key preprogrammed gestures.

The prototype was launched yesterday 
at an international conference in the US on human-computer interaction 
held in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

David Kim, a Microsoft Research PhD 
student at Newcastle University, said: ‘Ultimately, we would like to 
reduce Digits to the size of a watch that can be worn all the time.

‘We wanted users to be able to 
interact spontaneously with their electronic devices using simple 
gestures without even having to reach for them.

‘Can you imagine how much easier it 
would be if you could answer your mobile phone while it’s still in your 
pocket or buried at the bottom of your bag?’
