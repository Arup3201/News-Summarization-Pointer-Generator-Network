Mobile firm EE is to launch the UKs first 4G network on October 30th, the firm said today.

The move follows last minute crisis talks between operators, ministers and Ofcom yesterday which avoid last minute legal action.

'We are delighted to announce that the official launch of our new customer brand, EE, offering the UK’s first superfast mobile 4G and fibre broadband service, will take place on the 30th October 2012,' said Olaf Swantee, CEO of EE.   

CEO of EE, Olaf Swantee, said today the firms 4G network will launch on October 30th

EE will launch with support for six handsets:

Apple iPhone 5

Samsung Galaxy
SIII LTE,

Nokia Lumia 920,

Nokia Lumia 820,

HTC One XL

Huawei Ascend P1
LTE

'This is a significant milestone for the United Kingdom, and for the people and businesses of our country who will now be able to enjoy the huge advantages of superfast 4G technology for the first time.

'We are very proud to be pioneering, innovating and leading our industry in launching 4G for our nation through our new EE brand.'

The 4G services will allow 
uninterrupted access to the web on the go, high definition movies to be 
downloaded in minutes and TV to be streamed without buffering.

EE's
 4G network, which offers speeds up to five times faster than 3G, will 
be available on Apple's iPhone 5, HTC, Samsung, Nokia and Huawei 
devices.

EE, formerly known as Everything 
Everywhere, last month unveiled its plans to make the country's first 
state-of-the-art 4G services available to some 20 million people in 16 
cities by Christmas.

However, the threat of legal action meant it could not announce a launch date.

EE said
 it will offer 4G to customers by Christmas in London, Edinburgh, 
Cardiff, Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Derby, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, 
Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield and Southampton.

The
 group then plans to roll out the service to further towns, cities and 
rural areas next year, with population coverage of 70% and rising to 98%
 in 2014.

The announcement came after last minute crunch talks between ministers and mobile operators lifted the threat of legal action delaying launches.

Regulator Ofcom has now agreed to bring forward the auction process that will let competing operators launch their 4G networks.

Ofcom said the 4G auction process is now on track to begin at the end of the year to enable competitive 4G services across UK during the first half of 2013.

Ed Richards, Ofcom Chief Executive, said: 'The actions we have taken with industry and government avoids the risk of significant delay and is tremendous news for consumers who might otherwise have waited a considerable period for the next generation of mobile broadband services.

'Ofcom's objective has always been to release the spectrum as early as possible and we remain focused on starting the auction by the end of the year.'

The deal was thrashed out as mobile operators, Culture Secretary Maria Miller and communications 
regulator Ofcom gathered today for crunch talks over the plans.

The iPhone 5 is expected to be among the first handsets to be able to use high speed 4G networks

Ahead of the meeting, Ofcom has told the government that the process 
could be accelerated to launch 4G networks in many places by May or 
June.

It had been thought that it would take until the end of the year.

'We are hopeful of the outcome,' Ronan Dunne, Chief Executive of O2, told MailOnline before the talks.

'We wanted to champion the customer position, and we were frustrated there wasn't a clear timeline for customers.'

Mr Dunne admitted the process has been problematic.

'The whole 4G area has been a complex journey - more a marathon than a sprint.

'We are hugely excited, and customers are desperately keen to know when they can get 4G service.'

The speeds should be around 5 times the speed people currently, said Mr Dunne.

Rivals were angered that EE was given permission to launch first.

However, Ovum's Mr Howett said while EE may appear to have been given the early 
upper hand, it still has a tricky marketing task ahead if it is to 
capitalise.

'I think it is about two things,' he told the BBC. 'One is about what 
the pricing of 4G is going to be.

'EE would be be pretty mad to price 
people out of it, so I suspect it'll be quite competitive.

"The second thing is the iPhone 5 impact.

'For me and a lot of other 
people the iPhone 5 was very much an incremental upgrade. If people are 
in the market for a new phone, and people who were on a two-year 
contract are looking to upgrade, EE will say 'come to us'."
