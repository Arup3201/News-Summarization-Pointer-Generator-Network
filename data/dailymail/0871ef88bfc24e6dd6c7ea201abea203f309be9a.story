European leaders united in anger today as they attended a European Union summit overshadowed by reports of widespread US spying on its allies.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the allegations had shattered trust in President Barack Obama’s administration and undermined the crucial trans-Atlantic relationship.

Claims that the US National Security Agency swept up more than 70million phone records in France and may have tapped Mrs Merkel's own mobile brought criticism from the French and Germans.

Mrs Merkel's stern remarks at the EU gathering indicated she was not placated by talks yesterday with President Obama, or his personal assurances that the US is not listening in on her calls now.

‘We need trust among allies and partners,’ she told reporters in Brussels, Belgium. ‘Such trust now has to be built anew. This is what we have to think about.’

'The United States of America and Europe face common challenges. We are allies. But such an alliance can only be built on trust. That's why I repeat again: spying among friends, that cannot be

'It's become clear that for the future, something must change - and significantly. We will put all efforts into forging a joint understanding by the end of the year for the cooperation of the (intelligence) agencies between Germany and the U.S., and France and the U.S., to create a framework for the cooperation.'

The White House may soon face other irked heads of state and government. The Guardian said it saw a confidential memo suggesting the NSA monitored 35 world leaders' communications in 2006.

The memo said the NSA encouraged senior officials in the US to share their contacts so the spy agency could add foreign leaders' phone numbers to its surveillance systems, the report said.

The Guardian did not identify who reportedly was eavesdropped on, but said the memo termed the payoff very meagre. ‘Little reportable intelligence’ was obtained, it said.

Other European leaders arriving for the meeting echoed  Mrs Merkel's displeasure. Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt called it ‘unacceptable’ for a country to eavesdrop on an allied leader.

If reports that Mrs Merkel's mobile phone had been tapped are true, ‘it is exceptionally serious,’ Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told national broadcaster NOS.

‘We want the truth,’ Italian Premier 
Enrico Letta told reporters. ‘It is not in the least bit conceivable 
that activity of this type could be acceptable.’

Echoing Mrs Merkel, Austria's foreign minister, Micheal Spindelegger, said, ‘We need to re-establish with the US a relationship of trust, which has certainly suffered from this.’

France, which also vocally objected to allies spying on each other, asked that the issue of reinforcing Europeans' privacy in the digital age be added to the agenda of the two-day summit.

Before official proceedings got underway, Mrs Merkel held a brief one-on-one with French President Francois Hollande, and discussed the spying controversy.

The Europeans' statements and actions indicated that they had not been satisfied with assurances from Washington.

On Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney said President Obama personally assured Mrs Merkel that her phone is not being listened to now and won't be in the future.
