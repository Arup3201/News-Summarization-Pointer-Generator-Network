Police have released CCTV images of three men suspected of a possible racist attack on a woman who had her hair set on fire in a branch of McDonald's.

Detectives appealed for the men to get in touch for questioning over the incident, which took place in the early hours of the morning in Canterbury, Kent last week.

Now police are investigating the possibility that the attack was racially motivated, after one witness said the woman queuing for food was targeted 'simply because she is not white'.

Appeal: Detectives investigating the incident want the men featured in the footage to contact them

Those present said that the men who carried out the assault filmed the incident on a mobile phone then ran away before they could be apprehended.

Detective Sergeant Barry Carr, of Kent Police, said: 'Fortunately the fire was put out quickly and the victim was not seriously hurt, but things could clearly have turned out much worse.

'This was a nasty and extremely dangerous thing to do, and I urge anyone who recognises the men in the CCTV images to contact me as soon as possible.'

After the incident on Friday morning, a friend of the victim wrote on a Kent University Facebook page: 'To the disgusting person in McDonald's tonight who set my friend's hair on fire simply because she is not white.

'You are disgusting and a disgrace to the human race, she did absolutely nothing to you as she was simply waiting around for myself and others who were waiting for food.

'The fact you targeted her is disgusting, and that you left like a wimp without owning up to your criminal act makes you even more despicable.

'I cannot believe that in this day and age there are still people who are as racially discriminative and backwards thinking as you.'

Kent Police confirmed today that they were investigating the claim that the attack was motivated by racism.

McDonald's said in a statement: 'We are aware of the incident and are co-operating with the police fully.'

Anyone with information is asked to contact the police on 101.
