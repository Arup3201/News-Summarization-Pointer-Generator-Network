Commuters in Nanjing have found themselves stepping into the biggest sporting stages in the world - or at least imitations of them, thanks to a subway train specially decorated to mark the 2014 Youth Olympics.

The Chinese city is hosting the two-week long games, which feature 208 countries, 30 events and some of the world's most promising young athletes.

To mark the occasion, the floors of this subway train have been turned into football pitches, basketball courts and even swimming pools - complete with athletes motoring along underwater.

Unsurprisingly, China currently sit top of the medal table, with 10 medals including four golds. Russia are second and Hungary are third, while the USA sit just outside the top three in fourth and Great Britain and tenth, with one gold, two silvers and a bronze.

Team GB's gold was won by Ben Dijkstra, 15, in the triathlon, beating New Zealand's Daniel Hoy in a nail-biting photo finish yesterday. 

This is only the second ever Youth Olympics, after Britain claimed nine medals in the inaugural tournament in Singapore four years ago.

This time, 33 15-18-year-olds make up the team whose star is European junior gymnastics champion Ellie Downey. Her sister Rebecca competed in Beijing 2008, and Ellie will be hoping to follow in her footsteps in Rio in 2016.

Making a splash: The floors of a subway train in Nanjing, China, have been decorated to resemble sporting arenas to mark the 2014 Youth Olympic Games in the city

Having a ball: Commuters enjoy a rather sportier trip around the city, perching on the sidelines of football and basketball-themed subway carriages

Mini Olympics: The Nanjing Youth Olympic Games go for for just under two weeks, and feature many of the same sports we saw at London 2012
