If the dark mornings and chilly autumnal evenings have seen your usual  gym regime lapse, then Marks & Spencer could have the answer to all your prayers.

The
 high-street Mecca has unveiled the latest batch from its famous Drop a Dress Size Collection and is marketing the selection of figure-skimming designs as 'a stylish 
way to look slimmer in seconds.'

Each
 dress in the range is constructed with a seamed Secret Support lining, 
which works like a corset to help shape your figure, define your waist and create a 
smooth silhouette, the store says.

Slimmer in seconds: M&S have unveiled a new range of Drop A Dress Size frocks, which claim to use shapewear technology to make you look a size slimmer

It's the same technology as the 
famous M&S firm control shapewear – the inner slip is darted at the 
waist to cinch and shape while smoothing out lumps and bumps.

Available in sizes 8-22, the £59 designs aim to be simple day-to-eveningwear that M&S claims give the illusion of a slimmer shape 'in seconds'.

Of course, M&S isn't the only brand making the most of new bodyshaping technology. Countless retailers and clothing stores have jumped on the instant-slim bandwagon.

Body Frock also design dresses engineered to enhance a women's finest features.

Holly Willoughby, Kym Lomax and Kimberley Walsh have all benefited from the control lining in the dresses - the secret to the dresses' success - which the brand says fits 'slim and taut like a corset', making the garment instantly slimming and smoothing.

Mooi is another contender in the market. In April this year, they unveiled the S dress (the letter stands for 
'shape'), claiming the garment, made from machine-washable, crease-resistant material, would help its 
wearer drop a dress size.

Slimming: According to the brand, the Body Frock dresses, which start at £155, should fit slim and taut like a corset

Slimming style: Gok Wan has also created a range of slimming dresses, on sale for £35 at TU for Sainsbury's

Each
 of the £360 garments is made with 28 per cent elastane, which, Mooi say, creates a
 slimming effect that makes the wearer appear an entire size smaller.

Gok Wan, renowned for making women feel great about themselves and their bodies, was one of the first to harness slimming technology for the High Street for his collection for Tu at Sainsbury.

Inspired by Roland Mouret, whose fitted dresses hid inner corsets, he brought the technology to the masses with a range of colourful wrap dresses that would pull in tummies, smooth down lumps and VPLs and shape up bottoms and waists.

His latest collection features two £35 styles, both with tummy support slip which claim to 'pull you in and smooth any bumps.'

Body sculpt: Asda also have a range of body sculpt dresses, which come in more classic colours (L) £16 and the £25 animal print (R)
