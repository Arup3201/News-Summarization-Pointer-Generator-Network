David Cameron might be the leader of the country but he has revealed that he is secretly a follower of TV cook Nigella Lawson.

The Prime Minister has admitted he is a member of #TeamNigella rooting for the Domestic Goddess in her very public battle with ex-husband Charles Saatchi.

Mr Cameron brushed aside her admission to snorting cocaine and smoking cannabis to hail her as a ‘very funny and warm person’ who creates good recipes.

It seems the Prime Minister is on the right side of public opinion. A YouGov survey at the weekend showed Miss Lawson had actually gained public sympathy since dramatically giving evidence at the trial of her two former assistants accused of fraud.

Some 39 per cent of people have more sympathy for Miss Lawson than they did before she gave evidence - compared with just two per cent who have taken her ex-husband's side.

The fraud trial at Isleworth Crown Court heard a scathing email from Mr Saatchi which accused Miss Lawson of being 'so off your head on drugs' that she had allowed the PAs to spend 'whatever they liked'.

Giving evidence on the witness stand, Miss Lawson admitted to taking drugs in front of her children.

The daughter of former Tory chancellor Nigel Lawson began using the hashtag #Team Nigella, to thank her supporters during the divorce and courtroom ordeal.

Asked by the Spectator if he was a member of #TeamNigella, Mr Cameron admitted: ‘I am.’

He went on: ‘I’m a massive fan, I’ve had the great pleasure of meeting her a couple of times and she always strikes me as a very funny and warm person.

‘But I’m also an amateur cook and I like her recipes. Nancy [Cameron’s nine-year-old daughter] and I sometimes watch a bit of Nigella on telly. Not in court, I hasten to add.’

It is not clear if Mr Cameron has taken Miss Lawson up on her offer on Twitter of the receip for Holiday Hotcake, which she described as 'the perfect receip to show tanks for all your support and to those who hashtag #TeamNigella'.

Today the court heard Miss Lawson's personal assistants were able to spend nearly £700,000 on luxuries because their credit card statements were never scrutinised, a court heard today.

Italian sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo bought designer items from Chanel and Prada stores during a non-stop shopping trip to New York as they went on a four-year spending spree, the jury was told.

Charles Saatchi's accountant Rahul Gajjar said he did not check the statements for Coutts credit cards given to the pair 'line by line'.

The Grillo sisters are accused of committing fraud by abusing their positions by using a company credit card for personal gain.

Prosecutors claim the Italian sisters lived the 'high life', spending the money on designer clothes and handbags from Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Vivienne Westwood.

The pair, of Bayswater, west London, deny the charge against them.

The case continues.
