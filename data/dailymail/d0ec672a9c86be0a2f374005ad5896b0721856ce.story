Families bereaved by level crossing accidents have received a ‘full and unreserved apology’ from the boss of Network Rail.

Chief executive Mark Carne today apologised for the ‘failings’ by the company in ‘managing public safety at level crossings and in failing to deal sensitively with the families affected’.

The move came after MPs expressed their concerns that Network Rail showed ‘callous disregard’ on ‘too many occasions’ for families bereaved by accidents at crossings.

Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne apologised live on ITV programme Daybreak for the 'failings' by the company in 'managing public safety at level crossings and in failing to deal sensitively with the families affected'

A report by the House of Commons Transport Committee highlighted the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, pictured, who were killed at Elsenham crossing in Essex in December 2005

The MPs said all nine deaths at crossings in 2012/13 were ‘personal tragedies which could have been averted’ and said Mr Carne ‘owes each of the families it let down a full, public apology’.

Launching the House of Commons Committee report, chairman Louise Ellman said: 'Victims were erroneously described as 'trespassers' or accused of 'misuse' of the railway when, in fact, they tried to use level crossings appropriately.

'Network Rail's chief executive must provide a full, public apology to all of the families it has let down - both for the mistakes which contributed to the accidental deaths and for the subsequent treatment of bereaved families.

'Network Rail must also demonstrate that it has transformed the way in which it deals with people whose lives are changed by accidents at level crossings.'

Today, Network Rail boss Mark Carne apologised for ‘failing to deal sensitively’ with the tragic deaths.

He said: ‘I wish to extend a full and unreserved apology on behalf of Network Rail to all those whose life has been touched by a failing, however large or small, made by this company in managing public safety at level crossings and in failing to deal sensitively with the families affected.

‘Nothing we can say or do will lessen the pain felt by the families of those killed or injured at a level crossing. Today Network Rail is a very different company to the one which existed at the time of these tragic accidents.’

In the Transport Committee report, MPs said they would be ‘very concerned’ if Network Rail executives got bonuses this year, given the company was recently held responsible for a 2010 incident at Beccles in Suffolk in which a 10-year-old boy suffered life-changing injuries.

Another case the committee highlighted was the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, who were killed at Elsenham crossing in Essex in December 2005.

It said the rail company should disclose
 to the Elsenham families the findings of all investigations into why 
the documents were not initially disclosed.

During his apology today, Mr Carne, pictured right on ITV's Daybreak, said the company would address many of the committee's recommendations. He said: 'We will never be complacent when it comes to public safety'

During his apology today, Mr Carne said the company would address many of the committee's recommendations.

He said: ‘As we made clear when we pleaded guilty during the Elsenham court proceedings, it was a watershed in the way we thought about our approach to the risk at level crossings, and how we treat victims and their families.

‘As a result of this transformation, level crossings in Britain are amongst the safest in Europe, but there is still much that we can, and will, do and the committee's recommendations will help us in that endeavour.

‘We will never be complacent when it comes to public safety. As I start my term as chief executive I have made improving public, passenger and work-force safety absolutely integral to everything Network Rail does.

The Transport Committee report said rail regulators should set a target of zero fatalities at level crossings from 2020. A man missed being struck by a moving train as he jumped onto a crossing in Rainham, Kent, in 2009

‘Restoring public trust relies on openness and with that in mind we have made risk assessment information relating to almost all our 6,300 crossings available on our website. I will continue to explore ways to make our processes even more transparent so we can demonstrate clearly that we treat our responsibility for ensuring public safety with the utmost professionalism.’

However, Charlotte Thompson's father Reg Thompson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he still found it ‘difficult’ to understand how Network Rail ‘failed to consider the feelings of any of the families involved’.

He said: ‘Network Rail showed the utmost disregard to the families, to the point that they never contacted us, showed no concern or compassion at any point and indeed made it very clear that they blamed Charlie and Liv for their own demise up until they were forced to acknowledge their own guilt more than six years after the accident.

‘My daughter died over eight years ago, and still this goes on, and it goes on because of Network Rail's behaviour, because of their refusal over years to acknowledge documents which they knew they had in their possession and to behave in just a human way.’

Mr Carne said that since 2010 Network Rail had reduced the risk at level crossings by a quarter by investing around £130million in level crossing safety improvements.

These include closing nearly 800 crossings and appointing more than 100 level crossing managers, building footbridges to replace crossings, installing new warning systems and putting in power-operated gates and using new barrier technology.

The House of Commons Transport Committee report said rail regulators should set a target of zero fatalities at level crossings from 2020.

ELSENHAM, ESSEX, 2005 - On December 3 2005, Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and her friend Charlotte Thompson, 13, were on their way to Cambridge. There was no ticket machine on their platform and they had to cross the railway to the other platform to purchase their tickets. After purchasing their tickets, the miniature warning lights and yodel alarm indicated that there was a train approaching.After a train had stopped in the station they opened the unlocked wicket gate and proceeded back across the line. They were hit by a Stansted train.

BECCLES, SUFFOLK, 2010 - In July 2010, as Richard Wright drove his vehicle across a user-worked crossing on his farm, it was struck by a train. Mr Wright was injured and his 10-year-old grandson was thrown from the vehicle, sustaining life-changing injuries.BAYLES AND WYLIES CROSSING, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE, 2008 - Both a tram and a train were travelling towards the crossing near Hucknall in November 2008 in the same direction. There were no warning lights at the crossing.  The tram had much brighter lights and an illuminated saloon. However the train was travelling at a much higher speed and had caught up with the tram. Jean Hoggart, 56, and her grandson Mikey Dawson, seven, were struck by the train and killed.UFTON CROSSING, 2004 - In Ufton, Berkshire, in November 2004 a motorist killed himself by deliberately parking his vehicle on the automatic half-barrier crossing before the closure sequence had commenced. After striking his car, the train derailed, killing six people on the train, including the train driver. A further 71 passengers required hospital treatment.

MORETON-ON-LUGG Herefordshire, 2010 - The signaller had correctly lowered the barriers at the crossing. He was then distracted by a telephone call for a very unusual crossing request. This lapse in concentration resulted in him subsequently raising the barriers at the crossing. Two cars proceeded into the path of a train and one of the passengers was killed.MEXICO CROSSING, PENZANCE, 2011 – The incident occurred at Mexico footpath crossing, Long Rock, near Penzance, Cornwall, in October 2011. The footpath crossing was used solely to access the beach. The RAIB found that Jan Nicholls, 73, who was fatally struck by a train, may not have heard the train horn because of the prevailing wind direction. There were no other warning systems.
