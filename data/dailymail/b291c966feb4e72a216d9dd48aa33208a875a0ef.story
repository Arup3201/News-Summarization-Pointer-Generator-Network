Former Leeds managing director David Haigh thought he was to be offered a new job when he flew to Dubai for a meeting with the club’s previous owners GFH.

Haigh, who was the frontman for the Middle East bankers, was arrested and is being questioned over embezzlement, fraud and money-laundering allegations.

His advisers said last night that he would fight any charges.

Making his point: Haigh has said he will fight any charges

‘Although he is horrified to find himself in this position, he is answering fully every allegation made against him in the knowledge that he is entirely innocent of any wrongdoing,’ said a spokesman.

‘David flew from London to Dubai following what he clearly understood to be the offer of a new job with GFH. He was then stunned to be arrested at GFH’s offices and to be taken into custody.

‘In co-operating fully with the Dubai authorities, for whom he has complete respect, David is clear that he has no case to answer.’

GFH still own 25 per cent of Leeds after selling out to Italian Massimo Cellino.
