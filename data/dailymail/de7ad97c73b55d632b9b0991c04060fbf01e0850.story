If you enjoy scaling mountains, scuba diving or splashing around in water parks, this expansive swimming pool shows you can do it all from the comfort of your own home - as long as you have an extra $2 million floating around.

The luxurious, 140ft-long pool in Springville, Utah features a towering man-made mountain, five waterfalls, a lazy river and is deep enough for its owners to practice their scuba diving.

The feat of creative and engineering genius featured on Animal Planet's 'The Pool Master'.

Making a splash: A massive man-made mountain stands in the middle of a family's swimming pool in Utah

Secrets: It features a 60ft water slide that goes through the mountain and into the pool below

Stunning: From the top, there are stunning views of the landscape, as well as the expansive swimming pool

The mountain is crafted from reed bar, metal beams and 350 yards of concrete painted to look like the real thing, and inside there's a 60ft waterslide that spits swimmers out into the pool below.

The man-made mountain 'emulates the natural surroundings perfectly', Anthony Archer-Wills, the host of The Pool Master, says on the episode.

The tallest of the five waterfalls stretches to 20ft and forces more than 3,000 gallons of water per minute over the edge. The falls can also be reached from nooks inside the mountain.

Atop the massive boulder are bridges, pathways and steps that lead to the waterslide and give views over the 140ft by 60ft pool - which holds 360,000 gallons of water in total - in all its glory.

Luxury: Swimmers that are scuba dive certified can also descend to 26ft through an entrance inside

Exploring: The underwater route then brings the swimmer back out to the main swimming pool

Hidden away: Inside the mountain, there is also a kitchen with a grill and granite topped surfaces

Lair: There is also a whole changing room with showers, lockers and a bathroom for freshening up

But the mountain has more inside than cement and the occasional secret passageway - it also houses a kitchen with granite counter tops, an eight burner grill and a refrigerator.

A separate room holds changing rooms, lockers and a shower.

Encircling the entire pool is a 300ft lazy river, which is propelled by jets.

Or if you fancy being a little more active, you can don a wet suit and descend to as deep as 26 feet to check out the bottom of the pool. 

If you take this route, you enter from an excluded entry point inside the mountain then take a 54ft long and 5ft wide tunnel into the pool. Not bad for a home nearly 1,000 miles from the ocean.

The show did not name the family lucky enough to own the pool. 

The Pool Master launches in the UK in October on Animal Planet
