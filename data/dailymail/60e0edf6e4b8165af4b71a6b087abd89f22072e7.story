Turner Broadcasting announced Monday plans to shed nearly 1,500 jobs worldwide, about 10 percent of the news and entertainment giant's employees.

The layoffs include 300 workers getting the ax at CNN. 

Monday's announcement follows an offer of voluntary buyouts to 600 veteran employees in August, part of an overall cost-cutting effort at the Atlanta-based broadcasting company founded by Ted Turner.

Turner said Monday that the restructuring includes cutting jobs, eliminating unfilled positions and voluntary departures.

Axed: Turner Broadcasting announced Monday plans to shed nearly 1,500 jobs worldwide, about 10 percent of the news and entertainment giant's employees--including 300 at CNN

The reduction includes previously announced buyouts targeting 500 to 600 workers. Turner has about 14,000 full-time employees worldwide. 

The eliminations will affect 18 different locations and will come from its news, entertainment, sports, and business units as well as corporate positions.

The job cuts 'will come at all levels from across the company's news, entertainment, kids, young adult and sports networks and businesses, as well as corporate functions in 18 Turner locations around the world,' Turner said in a statement. 

The company also plans to add about 150 new positions in areas of investment and growth.

Turner's CNN division has struggled in recent years to find a programming strategy that will allow it to get and keep viewers as it competes with cable news rivals Fox News and MSNBC. And TNT and TBS, which once relied heavily on reruns of old broadcast shows to fill their schedules, are under increased pressure to create more original programming.

Turner Broadcasting System, which also owns The Cartoon Network, HLN, TruTV and Turner Classic Movies, is a unit of New York-based Time Warner Inc., the company behind HBO and Warner Bros. studios.

Shares of Time Warner fell 90 cents to close at $73.82 Monday, and were unchanged in after-hours trading.

Turner and Walt Disney's ESPN also announced Monday that they will more than double their annual payments to the National Basketball Association under a nine-year deal for broadcasting rights.
