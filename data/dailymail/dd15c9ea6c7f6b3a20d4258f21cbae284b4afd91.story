An ancient stone monument marking the grave of a king’s nephew who inspired one of the greatest love stories in British history is to be moved - to make way for a housing estate.

The 'Tristan Stone' was erected 1,500 years ago, reputedly to show the final resting place of Tristan, whose forbidden affair with the beautiful Irish princess Isolde has inspired poets for centuries.

But a council has now given a developer permission to move the stone, described by English Heritage as 'a significant scheduled monument', to a nearby field so that they can build a housing estate and park and ride next to the site.

Testament to doomed lovers: The Tristan Stone in its current site in Cornwall

Local campaigners are furious at Cornwall Council's decision to move the 5th Century stone from its spot outside Fowey so that Wainhomes can begin development work there.

Bert Biscoe, a member of Cornwall Council's cabinet, said: 'Such desecration is the equivalent 
of Napoleon shooting at the Sphinx for target practice.'

The developer plans to build 80 homes as well as a park-and-ride on the land close to the A3082, and have been given permission as long as they move the seven-foot high stone monument to a nearby field.

Mr Biscoe, condemned the decision to shift the ancient obelisk as 'cultural violence' and one of the 'worst attacks on heritage in the world'.

He said: 'How dare anybody 
presume to shift it without good reason? Building a mundane houses in 
its vicinity is not good reason.

'It’s an infringement of the cultural integrity of Cornwall; it is cultural violence.'

Cornwall Council confirmed permission for 
the homes had been granted subject to agreement on a number of issues, 
including the relocation of the Tristan Stone.

A spokesman for Wainhomes said moving the stone was a condition imposed on the company.

He said: 'We would be quite happy for
 it to remain where it is and we are simply responding to concerns 
raised during the planning process.'

According to legend, Tristan was killed by his uncle, King Mark of Cornwall for falling in love with his Irish wife, Isolde, also known as Isolde.

Tristan, a Cornish knight, is said to have fled Cornwall a number of times, often going into hiding with Sir Lancelot, one of King Arthur’s Knights Of The Round Table.

According to one of several versions of the legend, he eventually died (different versions have different culprits) and is said to have been buried in a field near Fowey, Cornwall, close to the stone monument.

The love story later inspired poems by Biroul, Thomas of Britain and Gottfried von Strassburg and the opera Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner.

The story of Tristan, a Cornish knight and Isolde, or Iseult, an Irish princess, is an ancient Celtic legend that became popular in the12th Century through French medieval poetry.  Several versions of the tale exist.

One popular telling of the story has Tristan defeating an Irish knight and bringing back the beautiful Isolde for his uncle, King Mark, to marry.

Tristan and Isolde unwittingly drink a love potion on their way back from Ireland and fall in love.  One version of the legend says the potion's effects last a lifetime, another says just three years.

Isolde has to marry King Mark, but she and Tristan seek each other out as lovers because of the potion.

After evading several attempts by courtiers to entrap them, the lovers are eventually shown up to the King who sentences them to death.

In one version, King Mark poisons Tristan while he is playing the harp to Isolde and she is so upset that her lover is dying, she begs him to crush her to death so they can die together, which he does.

In another version, Tristan escapes on his way to the gallows and rescues Isolde, but the pair are later caught.

King Mark agrees to pardon Tristan if he hands Isolde back to him and goes abroad, and Tristan goes to France where he marries another girl simply because she is called Isolde.

Years later he is poisoned by a dart and can only be saved by the first Isolde.  The second Isolde tells him the first one refuses to come, and he dies in despair.  Isolde arrives to heal him and dies swooning over his corpse.

Mark
 was a king of Kernow (Cornwall) in the 6th Century, the son of King 
Felix of Cornwall who died after a raid on his castle at Tintagel by the
 King of Ireland.

After this drama, the relationship between the two kingdoms was shaky, and Ireland demanded protection money from Cornwall.

When King Mark refused to pay, he sent his nephew Tristan to fight 
him, and bring back the beautiful Irish princess Isolde to be his wife.

The story begins when Tristan and King Mark's intended drink a love potion on the way back.

In various versions of the story, King Mark discovers his nephew is
 cuckolding him with his wife, tries a variety of schemes to stop the 
lovers or to catch them out, and eventually his suspicions are 
confirmed.

One telling has King Mark ordering his nephew to be hanged, and his wife to be banished to a leper colony.

Another version has him as a villain who rapes his niece and 
murders her when she has his child, and yet another has him murdering 
Tristan with a poisoned dart while he plays the harp for Isolde.

The Tristan Stone bears a Latin 
inscription believed to refer to King Mark.  It says: 'Drustans hic 
iacet Cunowori Filius' which translates as 'Here lies Tristan, son of 
Cunomorus'.

It is believed this refers to Tristan and King Mark, who was also known as Quonomorus, or Cunomorus.

Again there are various versions of how King Mark met his own end 
but he is believed to have been murdered by Sir Bellangre le Beuse, a 
grandson of his murdered brother.
