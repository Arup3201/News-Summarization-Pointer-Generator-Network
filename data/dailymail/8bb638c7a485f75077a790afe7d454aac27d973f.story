A zoo has renamed a Cuban crocodile called 'Fidel' after visitors complained about it being named after the communist revolutionary Fidel Castro.

The reptile is one of seven baby crocs born at the wildlife centre in Hoyerswerdain Saxony, Germany.

After they hatched, zookeepers chose to give the animals names associated with Cuba, so that visitors were aware of their country of origin.

But some tourists did not see the funny side of the feisty animal's name, saying it trivialised the actions of Castro who led a bloody uprising in Cuba in the 1950s and became the country's dictatorial leader soon after.

Carmen Lötsch, director of the zoo defended the decision, saying the name was not meant to 'glorify' the communist leader.

She said: 'Nobody intended it to be a direct reference to dictator Fidel Castro or indeed a glorification of him as a person', she said.

But a government finance and culture committee who handles funding for the park did not agree with the zookeeper's claim that the name was harmless.

The body, who last year allocated gave the zoo a grant of 40,000 Euros ordered for Fidel to be given a less controversial name.

Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz  is a Cuban communist revolutionary and politician who was Prime Minister of Cuba from 1959 to 1976.

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison after rejecting democracy and leading an unsuccessful rising in Cuba.

The young Castro was released under amnesty and fled to Mexico where he met the  Argentinean Marxist Ernesto 'Che' Guevara.

In 1956, Castro returned to Cuba with Guevara and a small band of insurgents.

They launched a bloody and full-scale attack toppling the government led by General Batista and Castro was sworn in as prime minister of Cuba.

The introduction of a Marxist-Leninist programme soon followed.

Despite his dictatorial style of government and ruthless suppression of opposition, Castro remained popular in Cuba.

In 1976, Cuba's National Assembly elected Castro President.

Castro stood down as President of Cuba in 2008 - passing the baton to his younger brother Raúl Castro.

It also urged Hoyerswerdain be more careful in naming animals in the future.

Lötsch said :The cultural body is one of our most import partners and ensures the survival of Hoyerswerda zoo.

'We therefore take its displeasure regarding the name very seriously, even if we cannot entirely understand  it.'

The controversial croc has since been called 'Fidelio', but even that name may not stick long.

Experts are yet to ascertain the sex of the animal, which means his now masculine name may have to be switched to something more feminine.

Workers have drawn up a contigency plan to call Fidel 'Fidelia' should the young animal turn out to be female.
