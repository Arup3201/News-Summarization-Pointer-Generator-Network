The Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund filed a lawsuit on behalf of gender non-conforming teen Chase Culpepper, 16, accusing the South Carolina DMV of violating the 16-year-old's rights by refusing to let him wear makeup for a driver's license photo

A 16-year-old South Carolinian is suing the state's Department of Motor Vehicles for not allowing him to wear makeup for a driver's license photo.

Chase Culpepper, who was born male, regularly wears eye shadow and eyeliner, and either androgynous or women's clothing. The teen does not identify with gender-specific pronouns.

Culpepper told reporters Tuesday that being ordered by officials to remove what they called a ‘disguise’ was humiliating.

The lawsuit filed on Culpepper’s behalf by the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund in federal court today said the DMV violated the teen's rights.

Back in March, the state agency refused to let Culpepper wear makeup for the photo because of a policy that bans license pictures when someone is purposefully altering his or her appearance.

The 16-year-old, who had passed his driving test, was forced to wipe his face clean to get his license.

The TLDEF stated in a press release that the DMV’s rule is unconstitutional because it is vague and arbitrary.

The lawsuit was brought by Chase’s mother, Teresa Culpepper, asking the court to rule that denying Chase the freedom to wear his everyday makeup in his license photo constitutes sex discrimination and violates his right to free speech and expression under the US Constitution.

‘As a mother, it broke my heart to see Chase being forced to be someone that he isn’t. Every time he pulls out his license, he is reminded of that, and that makes it even worse,’ said Teresa Culpepper. ‘I love my son just the way he is. The DMV should not have treated him this way.’

As for Chase, the 16-year-old is hoping for a do-over.

‘I
 want to take my license photo again, with makeup, so I can be myself 
and express to the world who I truly am,’ the teen said.

In
 June, the DMV rejected demands from Chase and the transgender advocacy 
group to be allowed to wear makeup for a driver's license photo.

Chase said at the time that DMV staff claimed agency rules dictated that the photo needed to show the 
person as they appear normally, and banned pictures taken in 'disguise'.

'This is who I am and my clothing and make-up reflect that,' Chase said. 'The Department of Motor Vehicles should
 not have forced me to remove my make-up simply because my appearance 
does not meet their expectations of what a boy should look like.'

However, a request to the DMV from the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund, which asked if the teenager could have his photo retaken, has been turned down.

Michel Silverman, executive director of the organization, said: 'Chase's freedom to express his gender should not be restricted by DMV staff.

'He is entitled to be who he is and express that without interference from government actors.'

But Beth Parks, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that the DMV will be sticking to its rules.

Ms Parks said that since August 2009, the policy for driver's license photos had been that 'at no time will an applicant be 
photographed when it appears that he or she is purposely altering his or
 her appearance so that it the photo would misrepresent his or her 
identity'.

She added that law enforcement agencies relied on the photos to identify people and said Chase's requests for a new picture would be denied.

'If it's Thomas Jones on the license and
 yet it looks like a female, that is very confusing for them. They want to know what the identity is,' she said.

Chase's mother told WYFF4: her son had been upset by his experiences at the DMV.

'They said he was wearing a disguise. It was very hurtful. He was absolutely devastated. That’s who he is 24/7,' she said.

Mrs Culpepper said the DMV policy had ruined what should have been an exciting day for the teenager.

'Instead,
 he was singled out and discriminated against because he did not meet 
the DMV’s expectations of how a boy should look,' she told Pink News.

'I want my son to be able to be himself without discrimination or harassment. I love him that way and the government should not be telling him that he’s not OK the way he is.'
