America’s queen of crime-writing Patricia Cornwell once ordered an investigation into one of Britain's most acclaimed female police officers, saying she was a jilted lover and a 'threat,' according to court documents.

Cornwell's relationship with Caroline Nicholl, now a renowned criminologist, was revealed in court documents regarding Cornwell's ongoing legal battle with her financial advisers over $40 million in squandered wealth.

In a 2008 email exchange filed by the defense, Cornwell asked an American police officer to conduct 'checks' on Nicholl, who was a chief superintendent with the Thames Valley police at the time of the relationship 17 years ago.

In one email she wrote: ‘I have a few
names of people who we should be “aware” of in terms of them being a 
problem/threat to me.'

Nicholl's name was at the top of the list.

‘I once had a relationship with her 
that ended badly,’ the e-mail read. ‘I cut her off and wouldn’t have 
anything to do with her.’

Nicholl said she was stunned by news of the filing.

‘I don’t understand anything that I could have done to precipitate this,’ she told The Mail on Sunday.

‘The last time I saw her was in 1996,' she said. 'It’s accurate that she broke it off. She didn’t give a reason.’

Ms Nicholl, 57, has now been dragged into the 
proceedings in the District Court in Boston in which 56-year-old Ms 
Cornwell is suing financial managers Anchin, Block & Anchin, 
claiming they improperly invested millions that she entrusted to them.

The firm claims that she squandered the 
money.

Nicholl's affair with Cornwell began when she invited Cornwell to do research for her books in Milton Keynes, a British town.

‘She was very smart, self-effacing and charming, and she clearly was enamored that I was a police chief,' Nicholl said. 'She thought the uniform was amazing.'

‘We were introduced by a police contact who was a mutual friend,' she added. 'I didn’t know who she was. I’d never read any of her books. So I was expecting an old biddy or something.

‘The next time we met was when she was on a book tour in London. I invited her up to Milton Keynes because she liked to do research. She was smitten with me and I was smitten with her.’

Before her affair with Nicholl, Cornwell had been married for nine years, from 1980 until 1989, to an English professer named Charles Cornwell who was 17 years her senior.

Shortly after the couple split, she began having an affair with Margo Bennett, a married FBI agent. The year-long affair ended in 1992 and it was revealed four years later, after Bennett's estranged husband was arrested and later convicted of attempting to murder Margo.

Cornwell is now married to Harvard psychiatry teacher Straci Ann Gruber. She waited two years to reveal her marriage and later said that Tennis player Billie Jean King had helped her come out and publicly reveal she is a lesbian.
