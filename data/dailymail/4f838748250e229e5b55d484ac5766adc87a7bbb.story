The skeleton of a father of two forced to work as a slave by a jailed family of millionaire travellers was found in a garden shed more than three years after he had gone missing, an inquest was told today.

Christopher Nicholls, of Bristol, was 41 when he was last seen alive on a doctor’s visit in March 2005, but his remains were discovered in the derelict shed in Staverton, Gloucestershire, in May 2008.

Mr Nicholls was picked up by the notorious Connors family a decade ago to work with dozens of other vulnerable men on their patio and driveway business, Gloucestershire Coroner's Court heard.

The men - often homeless drifters or 
addicts - were beaten and forced to work for as little as £5 a day. But 
how his remains ended up in the shed will remain a mystery, the inquest 
was told.

Mr Nicholls was 
found close to where the Connors lived at a traveller site. Police 
believe he had been ‘fly-tipped’ by the family after he was no longer 
able to work for them because of his injuries.

Former
insurance salesman Mr Nicholls had a history of alcohol and drug 
addiction and had not seen his father since 2002 and his two children 
since 2005.

The last 
confirmed sighting of Mr Nicholls was in March 2005. Five months earlier
in October 2004 he was in an accident with a van outside the traveller 
site and suffered serious head injuries.

Mr Nicholls was treated in hospital 
but the accident left him incontinent, with speech and memory problems. 
He would have needed lifelong medication and returned to live with the 
Connors.

Months later he tried to make a claim for compensation for his injuries and contacted a solicitor.

Detective Chief Inspector Dave 
Sellwood, who led the inquiry into the Connors, told the inquest that Mr
Nicholls and another street drinker called Edward McCann were picked up
by William Connors.

He found them towards the end of 2000 as they hitchhiked, were offered work and accommodation, and took them to Cheltenham.

Other family members: William and Mary Connors's sons John (left), 29, and James (centre), 20, and their son-in-law Miles Connors (right), 24, were also jailed at Bristol Crown Court last December

‘Edward McCann stated they were paid a pittance, not even a tenner a day,’ Mr Sellwood said.

‘Mr
McCann and Christopher would tout for work on behalf of William 
Connors. Both of them gave their benefit books to Brida Connors and 
neither ever saw the benefits again.

‘Sometimes when their benefits were cashed the Connors would buy them a small amount of food.

'Edward McCann witnessed Christopher being beaten on three occasions by William Connors. Christopher would get slapped by him if he came back from touting without a job. He saw William Connors assault Christopher with a rake'

Detective Chief Inspector Dave Sellwood

‘Mr
McCann said Christopher had the “gift of the gab” before his accident 
and he was good at getting tarmacing jobs on behalf of William Connors.

‘He
witnessed Christopher being beaten on three occasions by William 
Connors. Christopher would get slapped by him if he came back from 
touting without a job. He saw William Connors assault Christopher with a
rake.

‘He said that after the accident 
Christopher was “never the same again”. He started drinking really 
heavily and was constantly wetting and soiling himself.’

The
court heard that police had arrested Mr Nicholls and two other workers 
in January 2005 on suspicion of criminal damage to a driveway following a
complaint from a homeowner.

‘The
following day Edward McCann attended Cheltenham police station and took
responsibility for causing the damage to the driveway,’ Mr Sellwood 
said.

‘He was subsequently charged, pleaded guilty and sentenced to two months' imprisonment. He was put up to doing that by William Connors and he actually used it as a means to escape from the Connors.

‘He served some five weeks imprisonment and lied to William Connors about when he was to be released and was able to leave without him knowing and never returned to the family.

'He appears like other unfortunate men to have fallen under the malign influence and control of the Connors family'

Deputy Gloucestershire Coroner David Dooley

‘He left prison on March 4, 2005 and went to London and never saw Christopher again.

‘But while he was in prison he received a letter from William Connors saying Christopher was “no good anymore” and he had put £50 in each pocket and sent him on his way.

‘Mr McCann said that having fled he wasn't going to go back to be "a slave - as that's all you are is a slave, you're not a person like a workman. Do this, do that, do this, do that...".

‘We concluded that William and Brida Connors ran a criminal enterprise which consisted of recruiting vulnerable men and using them as cheap or free labour to build driveways or do domestic work around various sites they owned.

‘During our inquiry we identified 37 men who had worked for the family in this way. Christopher Nicholls was one such man.

‘Their sons, John and James Connors, were brought up and entered this way of life as did their son-in-law Miles Connors.

Police raid: Bizarrely, the Connors family kept money in a toilet at one of their caravans in Gloucestershire

‘It is clear from the accounts of those victims that they were cruelly exploited and subject to threats and violence and in many cases had their benefits stolen.

‘They all lived in poor conditions, worked long hours and survived on no more than £10 a day. A number of victims have described workers being 'fly-tipped' when they were no longer of any use to the family.

‘They explained this as workers being driven off a site and dumped leaving them to fend for themselves.

‘It
would seem that following Christopher's accident he was of less use to 
the Connors family as a hawker. His speech had been affected and his 
gait had been affected.

‘It 
is the view of the police inquiry that it is highly likely that in early
March 2005 Christopher was 'fly-tipped' by William and Brida Connors 
whilst still suffering the consequences of his accident.

William Connors, 52, wife Mary, 48, 
their sons, John, 29, and James, 20, and son-in-law Miles Connors, 24, 
were jailed in December last year after being convicted of conspiracy to
require a person to perform forced or compulsory labour.

They
lived the high life at the expense of the men, who they treated as 
their own private workforce. The profits funded a luxury cruise around 
the Caribbean and exotic holidays to Tenerife and Cancun in Mexico.

As well as holidays, they drove around
in top-of-the-range cars, including a silver A-Class Mercedes saloon, a
Rolls-Royce, a red Mini convertible, a Toyota Hilux pick-up, a Ford 
Ranger and a Mercedes van, and had built up a mounting property 
portfolio potentially now worth millions of pounds.

The
Connors' enterprise came to an end when police raided sites in 
Staverton in Gloucestershire, Enderby in Leicestershire and Mansfield in
Nottinghamshire in March 2011 following a lengthy surveillance 
operation.

‘At that time he would have had no access to benefits and no means to housing or to provide for himself.

‘We have been unable to establish the circumstances of Christopher's death due in no small part to the passage of time between his death and discovery.

‘There is no cause of death and no overtly suspicious circumstances. There is no evidence to link members of the Connors' family directly to his death.’

The inquest heard that Mr Nicholls' benefits continued to be cashed until March 2006 when letters were returned to the Department for Work and Pensions stating he no longer lived at the caravan site.

A post mortem examination could not confirm any cause of death due to the decomposition of the remains. Mr Nicholls was identified by DNA recovered from a tooth.

Mr Nicholls's father John and step-mother did not attend today's hearing, although his daughter Donna did. She did not wish to speak after the inquest.

Recording an open verdict, Deputy Gloucestershire Coroner David Dooley said: ‘He appears like other unfortunate men to have fallen under the malign influence and control of the Connors family.’

‘He was used as cheap labour up to and even after his road traffic accident on October 30, 2003, which left him with debilitating injuries.’

Mr Dooley added: ‘Where he died cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty. It is not known if he was brought by others to the shed or made his own way there before dying.

‘When he died cannot be ascertained with any precision. How he died cannot be ascertained due to the length of time the body remained undiscovered.

‘The police evidence confirms there is no evidence available to link any other person to his death.

‘What actually happened to Christopher Nicholls after the Connors family appeared to have considered him of no further use remains unknown as far as the police inquiry is concerned.

‘There isn't sufficient evidence to the necessary standard of proof to enable me to record any substantive conclusion explaining further how Christopher Nicholls came about his death.

‘The law requires me to enter an open verdict.’
