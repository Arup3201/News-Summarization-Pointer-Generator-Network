A convicted murderer confessed to his prison cell-mate that he was a 'modern-day hitman' who killed a retired colonel on his doorstep eight years ago for cash, a court heard today.

Christopher Docherty-Puncheon, 33, was already in prison on a separate murder charge when he confessed to killing retired colonel Lt Col Robert 'Riley' Workman, the jury heard.

Lt Col Workman was killed at his home in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, on January 7, 2004, but the case remained a mystery.

Lt Col Workman was killed at his home in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, on January 7, 2004

Docherty-Puncheon, a rat-catcher, who lived near the crime scene, allegedly revealed vital 
details of the murder to his cell-mate.

A court heard he deatiled how 83-year-old Colonel was holding a walking stick and looking away when the fatal shot was fired.

Jurors at St Alban’s Crown Court were
told he explained to his cell-mate that 'didn’t like to shoot people 
while looking into their eyes' and asked him to dispose of the murder 
weapon if he was released.

Lt
Col Workman was shot dead with a single blast from a sawn-off shotgun 
after answering a night-time knock at the door of his rural cottage in 
November 2004 in what is one of Britain’s most notorious unsolved 
murders.

Docherty-Puncheon, 
who is in a civil partnership, also allegedly claimed he had had a 
sexual relationship with the Colonel, describing him as 'wealthy and 
generous'.

Richard Latham QC, 
prosecuting, told the court Docherty-Puncheon made the admissions to a 
fellow prisoner as the pair watched a news report into the murder of 
21-year-old traveller Fred Moss. Docherty-Puncheon was later convicted 
of Moss’ killing.

Victim: Robert Workman, pictured in an armchair (left) and with his wife Joanna (right), was killed at his home in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, in January 2004

Mr Latham QC said: 'The defendant described himself as a modern-day hitman who killed people for money.

'He was proud of his expertise with firearms and his ability to manufacture ammunition.

'Later he claimed he had bought a Range Rover with the money he had been paid to kill Col Workman.

The
court was told Docherty-Puncheon became 'annoyed' when his cell-mate 
questioned his confessions and began revealing details of the murder.

Mr
Latham QC said: 'He told [the prisoner] that he had known Colonel 
Workman since 1998, that he had worked for him dealing with a wasps’ 
nest, that the two men had engaged in sexual activity with each other.

'He described his relationship with Col Workman in detail, stating that the Colonel was wealthy and generous with money.

Mystery: The killing of Mr Workman, pictured with his wife Joanna, was described in court as a 'whodunnit' case

'Initially,
he told him that he had killed the Col in connection with a matter 
which occurred seven years previously, but he later told him that the 
real reason was for money and that he’s been paid in cash.'

The
court heard Docherty-Puncheon told his cell-mate other key details 
including that he had called an ambulance and that the death had at 
first been treated as natural causes before it was later realised he had
been killed.

Docherty-Puncheon
also told his cell-mate where he had hidden the weapon he used to kill 
Fred Moss and that information eventually led police to discover the 
weapon, which had Moss’ DNA on it, the jury heard.

Later,
Docherty-Puncheon made another confession to a second cell-mate, John 
Horn, who received a reduction on his sentence for assault as a result 
of passing on information of the confession, jurors heard.

Mr
Latham said: 'It will no doubt be suggested to each of these men that 
they are lying, that they have made up a story about the confession.

That is why the independent evidence of the Moss trial and the basic facts surrounding it will be of great assistance to you.'

'Executed': Robert 'Riley' Workman, a retired lieutenant colonel, was 83 when he died

Earlier
the court was told Docherty-Puncheon received a number of calls to his 
landline on the day of the murder but all were diverted to voicemail.

Two hours after the fatal shot was 
heard by a neighbour, the defendant used his mobile phone to call his 
answerphone and pick up his messages, despite telling police officers he
was at home, the court was told.

His Land Rover, which contained a 
memorable personalised number plate spelling Soho, was also spotted 
during the hours he told officers he was at home.

During
a 25-year Army career the colonel, a Second World War veteran, was 
stationed in Canada, Nigeria, Germany, and Cyprus and travelled widely 
in the United States. After retiring he worked as an antiques dealer.

Docherty-Puncheon denies murdering Lt Col Workman and having a firearm with intent. The case continues.

The case continues.
