Education Secretary Michael Gove wants to have halved his department's running costs by 2015-16

Michael Gove will shed 1,000 jobs from the Department for Education as he tries to set an example to the rest of Whitehall.

The Education Secretary has pledged to do 'more with less' by halving the £580million running costs of his department by 2016.

He won the approval of Cabinet colleagues to conduct a radical 'zero base' review of his department, as though it were being set up from scratch.

But his plans have drawn the ire of unions, who warned they were balloting members on the reforms.

Mr Gove said poor performers will be 'speedily managed out' of their jobs and higher standards will be expected of those remaining.

Many back-office roles will also go as management consultants warned their costs were too high. Work that is not a ministerial priority is also likely to stop.

Children's services are likely to be hit, with resources diverted to supporting academies and free schools – which will account for one in four schools by 2015.

Staff will also be forced out of their expensive Westminster headquarters, which include a 'contemplation suite' and a massage room, to a cheaper building. Real estate costs for the DfE have soared to £40million – £6million of which is spent on vacant buildings.

Unions criticised the job cuts as an 'ideological attack on the civil service as a whole' and accused Mr Gove of 'playing politics' with people's livelihoods.

PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'Michael Gove appears to want to run his department as some kind of nightmarish Right-wing experiment, playing politics with people's livelihoods and putting at risk the very important services DfE civil servants provide to schools, teachers and the public.

'Staff in the DfE will not sit back and allow their jobs and the vital work they do supporting the education and development of our children to be used as some kind of ideological testing ground.'

A review document drawn up by the department's permanent secretary, Chris Wormald, said: 'While there is no formal headcount target, this is likely to mean that by 2015 the department will have fewer than 3,000 posts, around 1,000 fewer than we have now.'

Mr Wormald added: 'We will be smaller and will operate from fewer sites. We will focus on our duties to the taxpayer with renewed vigour, investing where we need to but always remembering that every pound we spend on ourselves must be justified to the citizens who pay for us.'

Cost-cutting will mean leaving the ministry's HQ in Great Smith Street in Westminster

Most Whitehall departments have been 
asked to save a third of their costs by Chancellor George Osborne as 
part of the austerity measures to reduce the country's deficit.

But Mr Gove's target was to cut 
administrative costs by 42 per cent by 2015, which he has extended to a 
goal of 50 per cent by 2016.

Stephen Twigg, Labour's shadow 
education secretary, said: 'While Labour support efficiency savings in 
the civil service, this document says certain work that isn't a 
ministerial priority will stop, raising the prospect that programmes and
 services will be axed. Michael Gove needs to explain to parents how 
this will affect them.'

When Ed Balls was in charge of the department he oversaw a £3million refurbishment which included the installation of a massage room

However, the Institute for Government 
think-tank said the plans were ambitious and could be a blueprint for a 
department that 'people will want to work in'.

Director Peter Thomas said: 'Change 
on this scale is inevitably unsettling for staff, but because this 
report confronts the implications of this, and the next spending review,
 leaders can create greater certainty for staff that they are building a
 department fit for the future.

'Importantly, this plan has learned lessons from other less successful efforts to transform departments in Whitehall.'

A department spokesman said: 'The 
review found that the department has committed and hard-working staff 
producing high-quality work, but that we can and should work more 
effectively and efficiently.'
