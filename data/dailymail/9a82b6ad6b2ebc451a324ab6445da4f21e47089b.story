Tottenham striking sensation Harry Kane was once on arch-rivals Arsenal's books.

The centre forward has been the star man for Mauricio Pochettino this season, his goal scoring exploits pushing him towards the England senior side.

But his career could have panned out much differently had Arsenal not let him slip through the net.

Playing for Ridgeway Rovers in east London, the same youth side David Beckham and Andros Townsend played for, Kane was scouted by Gunners spies and joined the club as an eight-year-old.

He spent a year in the red half of north London before returning to his amateur childhood side after Arsenal let him leave.

From Ridgeway, he joined Watford's youth set up where he spent two months before being snapped up by Tottenham as an 11-year-old.

And he has been at Spurs ever since, making his mark in the first-team this season with his excellent goal scoring run.

How Arsenal could do with Kane now following their current striker crisis.

The 21-year-old was again in inspired form for Pochettino's men on Thursday evening, notching a double as Tottenham beat London rivals Chelsea for the first time in five seasons in a thrilling encounter at White Hart Lane.

After the 5-3 win Kane said: 'It shows how good we are, scoring five goals against one of the best defences in the world and it is all coming together.

‘We are delighted, we want to keep this run going. I am enjoying it, especially as we get so much stick from the Chelsea supporters.’
