Grandparents who look after children whose parents have died, fallen ill or are unable to provide adequate care could be given parental rights to paid leave, the Prime Minister has said.

From next year adoptive parents will be entitled to nine months of paid leave.

David Cameron said yesterday the Conservatives may consider a manifesto commitment to extending this new right to grandparents who become the guardians of their grandchildren.

They currently get a 'raw deal', according to the PM.

He said: 'You do see sometimes grandparents stepping in and effectively bring up children, and of course under the rules they don't get quite the same rights as others.

'What you are saying is that if you can extend to adoptive parents things that birth parents have in terms of rights, couldn't you do that for grandparents?

'That is something I am very happy to look at in terms of the manifesto, and we have got some Conservative MPs here who have got some responsibility for giving me ideas, so I am sure they will take note of it.'

It is estimated that more than 200,000 grandparents become their grandchildren's carers when parents die, become ill or because of drug and alcohol abuse.

They are often unwilling to adopt or foster the children because they do not want to 'paint the parent out of the picture'.

Campaigners want paid parental leave to be extended to grandparents, as well as four to six weeks of unpaid leave during the 'crisis' period while children are settling in and are being kept out of care.

Last year a pensioner won the right to be treated as her grandson's foster mother.

The woman from Derbyshire, 68, who has been looking after the 13-year-old since he was a baby, went to the High Court after learning she would receive twice as much financial support if she was a stranger.
