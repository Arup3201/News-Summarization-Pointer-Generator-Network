Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has attacked Uefa’s Champions League rules that have allowed Arsenal to have an easier draw in this season’s competition than his own team.

Pellegrini considers it unfair to be facing tournament favourites Bayern Munich in their group for the third time in four seasons despite winning the Premier League while fourth-place Arsenal, who had to come through a qualifying tie to reach the group stage, were classified as top seeds and are odds-on to qualify past Borussia Dortmund, Galatasaray and Anderlecht.

Current Champions League seedings depend on previous results in the tournament rather than how they did in their domestic league which favours traditionally strong clubs like Arsenal rather than an emerging force such as City.

City have failed to progress beyond the last-16 in three attempts following tough draws which have seen them paired with the likes of Bayern and Real Madrid and Pellegrini, whose side play their first group game of this season’s tournament in Bayern’s Olympic Stadium on Wednesday night, thinks it is time to reward teams for becoming Premier League champions.

Manuel Pellegrini criticised UEFA and thinks Arsenal were given a more favourable Champions League draw

In a clear comparison with Arsenal, Pellegrini said: ‘I don´t think it´s good that the teams who play qualification because they finished fourth in their domestic leagues are in pot one (top seeds), where the strongest teams should be.

‘In our group we have three domestic champions, the English champions, the German champions, and the Russian champions (CSKA Moscow). So our group seems a bit unbalanced.

‘Maybe in the future there will be a system for the teams in the pots which goes according to their position in their leagues and the points won in Europe.

‘I think we need to find a modification whereby, for example, all teams who play qualification go into pot four, and all champions of their respective leagues and have a lot of points in Europe (a high coefficient) go into pot one.

‘There is a need for some modifications to not let something like what happened to us happen again, while the teams that play preliminaries appear to be the most important ones in Europe.

Manchester City have failed to seriously challenge for the Champions League so far in their short history

‘I think that the champions of England and the champions of the German league, with both leagues being among the best leagues in Europe, they deserve to be in pot one.’

Ironically, City and Arsenal faced each other in the Premier League on Saturday.

Pellegrini was hired by City to replace Roberto Mancini at the start of last season because of his Champions League success with Malaga who he took to the quarter-finals in 2013.

He managed to take City into the knockout stages for the first time in their history but were eliminated by Barcelona in the last-16 after finishing runners-up in their group to Bayern.

He now faces another tough task against Bayern, CSKA and Serie A runners-up Roma, who include Ashley Cole, but hopes last season’s run will help.

‘The fact of having qualified for the knockout stages having been in the toughest group increases the confidence of the players for this season and the future. I hope, but you never know of course, that we will see a more mature Manchester City in the Champions League, and a Manchester City that will try to do better than the year before.

‘Our win in Munich and the close tie against Barcelona when we had 10 men has given us extra confidence.’

While Real Madrid boast Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale, and Barcelona Neymar, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, Pellegrini has his own Galactico ready to explode.

‘I think that Sergio Agüero is among the best players in the world and I think it is now up to him to make it and fight for the Ballon D´Or as best player, because he has all the qualities you can ask of a football player,’ he said.

‘He is technically very strong, he is fast and has a lot of power. He is very intelligent, able to play in his position in between midfield and attack. And so we hope to see Sergio back in the form he demonstrated in the Premier League before his injuries hit him, and I think that he will make a difference this season.’
