It's been confirmed by police that the boy inside the home did not place the call to the police.

Brisbane Regional District Officer Inspector Rob Graham was outraged at the hoax.

'This is a very dangerous game to play - it’s potentially tying up lifesaving resources,' he said.

'If we had a real circumstance anywhere in Brisbane we probably would have been stretched thin.'

He said police would always respond to reports of an emergency situation but “swatting” was a frustration for officers.
