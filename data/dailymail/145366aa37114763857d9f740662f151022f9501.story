Italy boss Cesare Prandelli quit on Monday night after his side were controversially eliminated from the World Cup.

While England boss Roy Hodgson stays on despite exiting the tournament with only a point, Prandelli fell on his sword, along with Italian FA president Giancarlo Abete, after an 81st-minute goal from Diego Godin put Uruguay through to the last 16.

It is the second World Cup in a row that Italy have gone out at the group stage. They won the competition in 2006.

Prandelli told his post-match press conference: 'I talked to the president of the federation.. and gave my resignation.

'The technical set-up didn't work, and I take all responsibility for that.

'Something 
has changed since my contract was renewed. I don't know why. I chose a 
certain technical plan and that's why I'm resigning - because it did not
 work.'

Prandelli
 added: 'A second European Championship, third at the Confederations 
[Cup] and the qualification obtained in advance should not be 
under-estimated.

'The match was well-balanced in equal numbers, but the sending-off changed it all.'

Prandelli was not the only man to fall on his sword with president Giancarlo Abete also stepping down.

He said he would recommend that Prandelli changes his mind, but that he himself was going.

'I
 will go to the board and offer my irrevocable resignation too. I had 
already made this decision before the World Cup,' he said.
