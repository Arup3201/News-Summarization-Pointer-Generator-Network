Trial: Anxiang Du today pleaded not guilty to murder at Northampton Crown Court

A Chinese businessman today pleaded not guilty to killing a family of four as he appeared in the dock charged with murder.

Anxiang Du is accused of killing a university lecturer, his wife and their two daughters on the day of the Royal Wedding more than two years ago.

The 55-year-old spent 14 months in Morocco before being extradited to Britain earlier this year.

He was formally arrested in February, and today appeared before Northampton Crown Court to enter a plea.

Du wore wearing a black suit and light coloured shirt for the hearing, and wept in the dock as the charges were read to him.

Speaking through an interpreter, he pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Police launched a manhunt for Du after Jifeng "Jeff" Ding, 46, Ge "Helen" Chui, 47, and their two daughters Alice, 12, and Xing, 18, were found dead at their home in Wootton, Northamptonshire, on April 29, 2011.

Ding, a lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, had apparently been stabbed to death next to his wife.

Du, who ran a Chinese medicine shop in Birmingham and lived in Coventry, was arrested in Tangier in July last year.

Following a prolonged diplomatic effort by the British Home Office, he was extradited by Moroccan authorities and flown to the UK this year.

He was arrested as soon as he arrived at Heathrow Airport.

After today's hearing, Du was remanded in custody ahead of his trial, which starts next Tuesday and is due to last two weeks.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
