The BBC’s Christmas schedule includes a familiar line up of dramas, including the traditional Doctor Who and Strictly Come Dancing specials, the last ever episode of Miranda and Call the Midwife.

There will in addition be a string of one-off dramas, including an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s classic book Esio Trot starring Dustin Hoffman and Judi Dench.

Also included will be the return of Still Open All Hours, the reprise of the classic sitcom starring Sir David Jason. But it is a Christmas special of Top Gear that will generate the most interest.

Christmas schedule: The traditional Doctor Who special will be on the BBC. Pictured are Wolf (Nathan McMullen), Ian (Dan Starky), The Doctor (Peter Capaldi), Clara (Jenna Coleman) and Santa Claus (Nick Frost)

End of the show: Last month, comedian Miranda Hart (left, with Stevie, played by Sarah Hadland) revealed the two Christmas specials of her hit sitcom Miranda will be the last in the series

The episode sparked fury when it was filmed in Argentina earlier this year, with locals taking offence at the H982 FKL number plate on a Porsche driven by Jeremy Clarkson, believing it was a reference to the 1982 Falklands conflict.

Clarkson denied the plate was chosen deliberately and claimed that he and his fellow presenters were forced to hide under their beds and flee Argentina after an angry mob searched their hotel and tried to attack them.

Other Christmas programmes include The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm, a BBC1 adaptation of the popular children’s books about an absent-minded inventor that will star comedian Harry Hill in his acting debut.

The Boy in The Dress, also on BBC1, is a one-off drama written by David Walliams, that will star Jennifer Saunders and include a cameo by supermodel Kate Moss.
