A pastor has been killed in a bizarre tragedy after a man with his clothes on fire ran into his church screaming for help and ignited a massive blaze.

John Sterner's clothes were on fire when he ran into the rectory of the Episcopal Church on Tuesday morning in Ocean City, Maryland, according to fire officials. 

Reverend David Dingwall died in hospital following the fire after he was stricken by smoke and 
heat when he went to save his computer from the second floor of the burning building.

A female church volunteer was left badly burned after Sterner bear-hugged her and set her clothes alight. The woman, who is not being identified at present, is being treated at a burns unit in Baltimore. 

Deadly blaze: John Sterner, 56, ran into the rectory of an Episcopal church with his clothes on fire, causing a blaze that killed himself and the church's pastor

Dead: Dingwall is seen being taken away from the scene by firefighters after the blaze on Tuesday morning in the rectory of Maryland's St. Paul's By-The-Sea Episcopal Church

Victim: The pastor, Rev. David Dingwall, died at a hospital after the fire after running into the burning building to save his computer

'Bizarre': Rev. Heather Cook of the Episcopal Diocese of Easton said the man later identified as Sterner 'ran in screaming for help'

Sterner, 56, died at the scene from his injuries. It is unclear how the man, who has a lengthy criminal history, came to be on fire.

Sterner had previously been arrested for assault, breaking and entering, and malicious destruction of property.

He was convicted of drug possession and possessing an open container of alcohol in public, according to online court records.

The cause of the fire at St Paul's By-The-Sea Episcopal Church remains under
investigation today.

A church administrator and male volunteer Bruce Young also witnessed the horrifying incident.

Mr Young suffered minor burns and appeared visibly shaken following the blaze.

Reverend Heather Cook of the Episcopal Diocese of Easton said the man later identified as Sterner ‘ran in screaming for help'.

Ms Cook said: ‘This is just such a bizarre incident.

'It's bad enough to lose somebody but right before Thanksgiving through a bizarre kind of fire, people are stunned.

'It's not just the parish. It's the whole Ocean City community. People are aghast.’

Reverend Dingwall, a native of Canada who 
moved to Maryland's Eastern Shore in 2003, became rector of St. 
Paul's By-The-Sea Episcopal Church in 2005.

Dingwall was already unconscious when firefighters retrieved him from the second floor, authorities said.

There was little damage to the church itself. Although the building was once the 
church rectory, Reverend Dingwall did not live there, Reverend Cook said. It housed a food
bank and church offices.

A
rectory, or clergy house, is the residence, or former residence, of one
or more priests.

These homes are typically owned and maintained by a 
church, as a benefit to its clergy.
