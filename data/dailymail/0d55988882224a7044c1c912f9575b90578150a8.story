Barely half of all police officers would report a colleague for administering a punishment beating on a suspect, according to a study which concluded there is a ‘blue wall of silence’ in policing.

A study into police ethics by the Open University found just 54 per cent of officers would ‘definitely’ tell on a fellow officer who punched a suspect for trying to escape.

Its author, Dr Louise Westmarland, senior lecturer in criminology at the Open University, said the findings show there was a ‘blue wall of silence’ which ‘still exists’ within the police.

She told a conference on police standards that ‘the study found officers were unlikely to report officers even in cases they thought were serious'.

Nearly one in five officers said they would definitely not report a colleague who ran a private security business in breach of the rules.

Around 17 per cent would definitely not report someone who ‘accepted unsolicited gifts on duty’. One in four officers would definitely not report an officer who accepted food and alcohol on occasions such as Christmas.

On the violent attack, officer were told a colleague ‘punched a suspect a couple of times as a punishment for fleeing and resisting’.

Around 10 per cent said they would 
definitely or maybe not report the incident, while 21 per cent said they
said they possibly would report it, while 13 per cent did not say 
either way.

The survey collated responses from 520 police officers at three unnamed forces.

Dr
Westmarland said the study also found that overall officers were 
‘uncertain’ about what was against the rules and what was allowed.

She said: ‘The findings of the study reveal that officers seem uncertain of the rules and regulations covering their behaviour, especially at the lower end of the spectrum.

‘In other words, officers were not clear about the bending of rules covering minor offences such as working in their spare time or accepting free drinks or small gifts.’ 

More experienced officers were more likely to report a colleague than younger officers.

Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘We all expect our police officers to uphold the highest standards of integrity, but this startling research shows how, for many, the line between right and wrong is indeed blurred.

‘It is also apparent that for some officers, the sense of proportion has gone wrong. Use of inappropriate force and cover ups are completely unacceptable for officers of the law.

‘The police service is undergoing significant reform, with the new College of Policing and a tough new Chief Inspector of Constabulary it must take this opportunity to make sure that our expectations for officers’ conduct are clearly established and upheld.’
