Arsene Wenger is set to receive a huge fitness boost ahead of Arsenal’s crunch clash with Liverpool a week on Saturday.

Jack Wilshere, Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Debuchy are all back in training and close to rejoining the first team.

If all goes according to plan the trio should be available to face Liverpool at the Emirates.

Captain Mikel Arteta (left) is also expected to be available for selection following his return to training

Wilshere has missed four months following an ankle operation, and Arteta has missed five months with ankle and calf issues.

Right back Debuchy has been sidelined since January 11 with a shoulder injury.

Midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also hopes to be available for the game against Brendan Rodgers’s side on April 4 after a hamstring injury. But he may have to wait until the trip to Burnley on April 11 for his return.
