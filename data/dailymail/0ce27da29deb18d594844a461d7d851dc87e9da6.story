The sight of a pretty brunette wearing denim shorts would distract most men.

But hopefully for golfer Tom Lewis, the presence of his girlfriend won't throw him off his game.

Lara Cornell almost stole the show today as she turned out to watch the amateur play his second round of the Open.

Golf Wag: Tom Lewis's girlfriend Lara Cornell is all smiles on day two of the British Open

Lara yesterday proved to be somewhat of a good luck charm as Lewis stunned the sporting world with a record-breaking 65 to share the lead.

It is the first time an amateur has led after opening day since 1968, and the lowest score by an amateur at the Open.

Although his father Bryan, a teaching pro, was too nervous to watch his son play, Lara was all smiles as she joined the rest of Tom's family at Royal St George's.

Making history: Amateur Tom stunned the golfing world yesterday by sharing the lead

Lewis, from Welwyn Garden City, has been playing golf since he was four-years old.

He was named after his father's idol, 61-year-old golfing legend Tom Watson, who, ironically, he is playing with in the opening two rounds this week.

His second round couldn't quite match the brilliance of Thursday's effort, but at -1 he is still well on course to make the cut for the weekend.

Natural: Tom has been playing golf since he was four-years-old

The 20-year-old, who is dyslexic, left school at 16 to concentrate on the sport full-time. He went on to become British Boys' Champion in 2009 and won the St Andrews Trophy last month.

His brother Jack, 18, also a golfer, told
The Telegraph: 'He started playing when he was four. My father spent 15 years making Tom what he is today.

'He spends his life on the driving range or in the gym. But he has a girlfriend, Lara. She's a nice girl.'

Pianist Benjamin Grosvenor, 19, played in the  first night of the Proms last night, becoming the youngest soloist to do so in its 117-year history.

Benjamin, from Essex, has just been signed up by music giants Decca for its Classics label, its first British pianist for six decades.

He admits he is not a conventional musical pin-up, and that his hair is styled only by wind and gravity.

The youngest of five brothers, his father is an English teacher but he owes his success to his piano teacher mother, who ‘shaped me musically’.

However, he admits his talent makes it hard for him to enjoy music, explaining: ‘I don’t listen to anything for pleasure – because it isn’t a pleasure. It’s agony, due to my tendency to analyse everything.’
