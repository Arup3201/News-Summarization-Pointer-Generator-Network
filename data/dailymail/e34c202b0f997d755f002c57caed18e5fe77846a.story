The FBI has released photos made from surveillance video of three masked thieves stealing historic gold nuggets on display at a San Francisco bank museum after ramming a stolen SUV through its revolving door.

San Francisco police say the robbers took up to 10 ounces of gold worth roughly $10,000 early Monday.

One of the robbers held a gun to a security guard's head while his accomplices stole the gold nuggets from the Wells Fargo History Museum, the site where the bank launched in 1852. 

The photos released Thursday show the men in ski masks and gloves that obscure their identities. They're seen next to the SUV covered in broken glass and grabbing a display case

Wells Fargo Bank officials have vowed to reopen the popular corporate museum in the heart of San Francisco's financial district.

The museum is a destination for schoolchildren and tourists and includes two restored stagecoaches, a working telegraph and other California Gold Rush-era memorabilia. 

'Rest assured, the museum will reopen, so it can continue to serve the thousands of visitors and Bay Area residents who visit it each year,' Pulido said. Wells Fargo opened its first branch on the site in 1852, he said.

The tactic mirrored three other smash-and-grab thefts involving vehicles in the San Francisco Bay Area since May. Police said they are investigating whether there's a connection.

Last week, thieves backed a U-Haul van through the front of a Patagonia store near San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, loaded it with high-end outdoor clothing and gear, and sped off.

On Nov. 26, two men rammed a vehicle into an upscale designer boutique in Union Square and took handbags.

Across San Francisco Bay, robbers in May busted through the glass at an Apple Store in a bustling shopping district in Berkeley to steal electronics.

Police did not reveal the value of the stolen merchandise in any of the cases.

In Tuesday's robbery, the stolen gold was estimated to be worth roughly $10,000, but Wells Fargo officials were trying to determine exactly what was taken before settling on a more precise figure.

The robbers may have difficulty selling the nuggets unless they get melted down

Dealers of precious metals say they will be on the lookout for nuggets with historical significance that suddenly appear on the market, rare coin dealer Don Kagin said. The robbers may have difficulty selling the nuggets unless they get melted down, he said.

Melting the gold could remove possible markings concerning when and where the nuggets were mined, said Fred Holabird, a mining geologist and an owner of a rare and unique collectibles business in Reno, Nevada.

'This is such bad news from my viewpoint,' he said, calling the potential loss of historical indicators a tragedy.

Holabird said the nuggets could be worth two to 10 times the value of gold, now selling for about $1,300 an ounce on the open market.

Selling stolen precious metals is difficult but not impossible.

Robbers who swiped $1.3 million in gold, quartz and other valuable metals on display at the California State Mining and Mineral Museum in 2012 were able to sell about $12,000 worth of gold to pawn shops and dealers, police said.

Some of the stolen items, including a bag of ground-up quartz, were recovered. Five men were convicted of the heist at the museum in the Sierra Nevada foothills.
