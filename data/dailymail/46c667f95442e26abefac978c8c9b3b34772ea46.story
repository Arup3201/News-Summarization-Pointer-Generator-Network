A young woman with eczema so severe it looked as though she was suffering painful sunburn finally has a clear complexion, thanks to a'magical' organic treatment.

Elena Haydon,  from Bristol, was left horrified when she woke up one day to find her face was covered in large red blotches.

The itchy red rash covered the 21-year-old's whole face, resembling severe burns and leaving her in agony.

For years Miss Haydon tried countless antibiotics, steroid creams and other well-known treatments - but to no avail.

But when her aunt suggested an organic cream, Miss Haydon felt she had nothing to lose.

And today the 21-year-old photography graduate has the perfect complexion she has so desperately longed for.

Miss Haydon's eczema was so bad it looked as though she was sunburnt, and she was unable to wear make-up as it caused her skin to flare up. Now her skin is clear (pictured) she says she 'has her life back'

She said: 'Waking up one morning to discover I looked like I'd been burnt was a teenage girl's worst nightmare.

'I could no longer wear makeup because it was too painful and it would make the eczema flare up.

'My sore face started to take up my whole life, I found myself looking down when I spoke to people to try and hide it.

'I no longer felt "pretty" and as much as I tried to fit in I never really felt like I did.

'I visited my GP and different specialists more times than I can remember but no antibiotics would work.

'Steroid creams would help for a short time but then they would start to thin my skin.

Purepotions has a range called Skin Salvation suitable for eczema sufferers.

The products contain beeswax, which manufacturers say works as a natural antibacterial barrier, protecting the skin from external irritants.

They also contain hemp, which is rich in essential fatty acids which are lacking in those with dry skin.

Manufacturers claim the products replenish dry skin with natural oils and has no known side effects.

They contains no parabens, preservatives or perfumes, they added.

'Over three years later I'm now eczema free and no longer feel like people are staring at me.

'I finally have nice skin and have my confidence back.'

Doctors said the inflammation was triggered by stress, noting it flared up when she was preparing for her A Levels.

The painful red patches of eczema appeared  on Miss Haydon's face, but also spread to her hands and elbows.

She said: 'I lost more and more confidence every day, the eczema had a huge effect on my life.

'None of the medication prescribed to me by the doctors helped, I thought it would never go away.

'The eczema would give off a burning sensation as well, leaving my cheeks feeling incredibly warm.

'But the more angry and stressed I got, the worse the eczema became.

'People would stare at my face and ask what was wrong with my skin - I knew it looked so burnt and horrible - it was humiliating.'

She says she is lucky to be supported by her boyfriend Tom (pictured left). 'He loves me with or without my sunburnt looking skin,' she says

After her auntie saw an advert for a cream called Purepotions in a magazine, Miss Haydon gave it a try. She found it worked and cleared her skin. 'I can go out now with my head held high with fresh looking skin,' she says. Here, she is pictured (right) with her friend Amelia (left)

Luckily Miss Haydon received support from her boyfriend, family and friends who all helped her try to find a treatment.

She said: 'I've been with my boyfriend Tom now for six years and he loves me with or without my sunburnt looking skin.

'When my confidence was at its lowest he would always tell me how beautiful I was and picked me straight back up again.

'My mum was so worried about me, she knew how badly it could affect me sometimes, I don't know how I would've got through it all without her.'

But it was Miss Haydon's auntie who came to her rescue after reading about a cream - known as Purepotions - in a magazine.

After further research and digging Miss Haydon decided to give the organic cream, created by Natalie Balmond, a try.

When her eczema was at its worst, Miss Haydon said her mother was worried about her, knowing how it could affect her confidence. Here, she is pictured (right) with mother Mandy (left) after her graduation

Miss Haydon said the Purepotions cream which cleared her skin was 'magical' and 'life changing'. She is pictured here after beating her eczema

Miss Haydon said: 'It was great to find someone who truly knew the pain of suffering from eczema.

'Natalie's daughter suffered from chronic eczema so she created Purepotions which contains natural ingredients and couldn't irritate the most sensitive of skin.

'It was magical - within just a few days my eczema started to clear up and I've never looked back since.

'I finally have my life back, I can go out now with my head held high with fresh looking skin.

'I want to say a huge thank you to Natalie for creating something so wonderful and life changing, it literally is my favourite possession.'
