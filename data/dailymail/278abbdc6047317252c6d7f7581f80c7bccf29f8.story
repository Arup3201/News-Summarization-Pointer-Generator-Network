The North Sea has been devouring the fields, roads and even villages of the East Yorkshire coast for hundreds of years and its inexorable advance has become a fact of life for seaside residents.

Now it is predicted that hundreds of homes will disappear in the area over the next century, as more properties fall victim to the rampant coastal erosion attacking the coastline.

More than 200 homes are predicted to slip over the cliff edges between Flamborough Head, near Bridlington, and Spurn Point, 45 miles further south, in the next 100 years.

Meanwhile, people living in the Skipsea area are expecting around 20 homes in their village alone to disappear in the next few years. 

Skipsea residents have had to get used to an ever-changing cliff-top landscape littered with abruptly ending roads, doomed buildings and the half-remnants of once-loved gardens.

The policy so far on the East Yorkshire coast has been to concentrate sea-defence funding on 'hard-points'. These are the larger communities, such as Withernsea, and strategic facilities, such as the Easington gas terminal.

Given the huge cost of such defences, the most cost-effective solution for the rest of the seafront has been to let the inevitable happen. 

Around 30 villages have completely disappeared into the North Sea since Roman times including places like Hyde, Withow and Cleeton which are now under the waves more than a mile off Skipsea

The coastline has moved around 12 miles in the last 10,000 years and currently retreats at an average of up to two metres a year

The coastline has moved around 12 miles in the last 10,000 years and currently retreats at an average of up to two metres a year.

This varies from location to location, though, and yearly losses of more than 18m in some places are not unknown.

Environment Agency information uncovered  last year suggested 7,000 homes would disappear due to coastal erosion in England and Wales over the next 100 years.

Severe storms in December 2013 saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of England - and at Hemsby (pictured) in Norfolk, coastal erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea

More than 800 of these properties will go in the next 20 years, and homeowners living in them now face the prospect of being forced to move to a safer area with no compensation scheme in place.

The most at-risk area in the next two decades was said to be Cornwall, with 76 properties expected to be lost.

And three local authority areas are forecast to lose more than 250 properties each when looking a century ahead. These include Great Yarmouth (293), Southampton (280) and Cornwall (273). 

In December 2013, severe storms saw about 1,400 homes flooded on the east coast of England. The tidal surge which hit the east coast was described as the ‘most serious’ for 60 years. 

This three-bedroom bungalow with views over the North Sea in Happisburgh, Norfolk, was bought for £20,000 in 1987 - and the Daily Mail reported in 2008 how it was worth £1. The owners left in 2011

A house that was bought for a knock-down price in Torquay, Devon, fell into the sea in April 2013 - three years after Sue Diamond paid £154,000 for it

Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes as tides in the North Sea reached higher levels than the 1953 floods. Two people died - in West Lothian and Nottinghamshire. 

At Hemsby in Norfolk, cliff erosion resulted in seven properties collapsing into the sea.

Coastal community campaigners claim that the Government should do more to help residents living in vulnerable areas move elsewhere, if it cannot defend their properties. 

The Government has said it will have spent more than £3.2bn over the course of this Parliament on flood management and protection from coastal erosion. It says this has led to better protection for an additional 15,000 houses.
