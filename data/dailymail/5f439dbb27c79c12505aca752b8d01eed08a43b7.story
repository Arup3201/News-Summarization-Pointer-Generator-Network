Louis van Gaal has been told to carry on spending in his bid to make Manchester United great again.

Despite the club having already spent almost £60million this summer on Southampton left back Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera of Athletic Bilbao, Old Trafford executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward insists there is no limit on the funds available to the Dutchman, who is with his squad in Los Angeles.

‘There is no fixed budget,’ Woodward told MUTV. ‘Financially we are extremely strong, funds are available. Louis is assessing what’s been going on, we’ve been in dialogue for some time about targets, so there’s a lot of work going on behind the scenes. Watch this space.’

Woodward also confirmed that there are likely to be departures as well as arrivals before the start of the season.

Asked
 if players would be  leaving, Woodward said: ‘Yes, the manager makes 
that decision. A few have already gone, there may be a few others that 
go.

‘It’s also worth 
commenting we’re not in Europe this year, there are less games, maybe 
the manager takes the view he wants a tighter squad to bed in. Last 
year, Liverpool performed extremely well with a smaller number of 
players, but that’s a decision for the manager.’

Liverpool
 have no such limitations now, and Loic Remy is set to become their 
fifth signing of the summer when he joins the squad in Boston this week.

Liverpool’s £8.5million 
bid for the France forward was accepted by Queens Park Rangers over the 
weekend and Remy will  complete the formalities of a medical when he 
links up with Brendan Rodgers’s squad.

There
 is increasing confidence Remy will be joined by Southampton’s Dejan 
Lovren, who has been Rodgers’s top central defensive target all summer.

Liverpool
 had a £20m bid rebuffed in early June. Yet he is keen on a Merseyside 
move, and Southampton look set to grant Lovren his wish and take the 
fees they have received from Liverpool in this window to £47.6m, having 
sold them Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert.

Southampton
 are in danger  of losing another player with Morgan Schneiderlin, 24, 
keen to join his former manager Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham, who he
 prefers to their rivals Arsenal, for around £16m.

Pochettino
 has signed left back Ben Davies and goalkeeper Michel Vorm after a £15m
 deal was agreed with Swansea that will see Gylfi Sigurdsson go the 
other way. Sigurdsson, 24, was pulled out of Saturday’s 3-3 draw with 
Seattle Sounders after his move was agreed.

Roberto Soldado and Iago Falque secured the draw in a game that marked
