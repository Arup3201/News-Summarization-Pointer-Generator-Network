A Maryland man shot dead his neighbor's dog after it wandered on to his property, and then posted a picture of its body on Facebook.

Before killing the one-year-old dog, named Tank, Kenny Woodburn had posted a warning on social media saying if it strayed in his yard again it would die.

The dog's owner, Richele Ince, who bought Tank as a gift for her four-year-old daughter, has started an online petition calling for Woodburn to be charged.

Warning: graphic pictures

Shocking: Kenny Woodburn posted this photo of him with the dead dog on Facebook

Killed: Tank, a one-year-old Labrador-pit bull mix, was shot after he escaped from his house

The 21-year-old had been on her way home from work on March 12, after a relative called to say her dog had managed to escape from the house. 

But, before she could find the Labrador-pit bull mix, Woodburn had shot the dog on his property.

Hours before the shooting, the 29-year-old had posted a warning on Facebook, saying if Tank came into his yard 'Hey going to dye today [sic]', the Examiner reported.

Ince, whose boyfriend is currently deployed with the Air Force in Afghanistan, said she didn't see the warning, and claimed Woodburn had never complained to her about her dog before.

She believes Tank was making his way to the day care center where her daughter was, and where the dog was an unofficial mascot. 

'The direction that he shot was the 
same direction as the daycare,' Ince's cousin, Theresa Fenhagen, said on
 the Justice For Tank petition page. 'The outcome that day was very sad 
but could have been worse.'

On his Facebook page, Woodburn claimed the dog had come after him, and that he had no choice but to shoot it.

'The
 f***** came after me ... so I put him down.' he said on Facebook, 
adding that animal control had told him he would be within his rights to
 shoot the dog.

His post showing images of the dead dog were later removed.

Tank's owners say he was a gentle dog that had never shown any aggression, and have alleged that Woodburn used treats to lure the dog into his yard.

The dog has been buried at the daycare center, where he was a popular visitor with the children.

St Mary's County Sheriff's Department and Animal Control are investigating the case and, according to Fenhagen, it is likely Woodburn will be charged, possibly with animal cruelty.

Sheriff Tim Cameron told Bay Net his department had received a lot of calls from people who had seen the picture of Woodburn with the dead dog, and wanted to complain.

He added that the department had received calls from residents living far from the Ridge neighborhood where the shooting took place.

The sheriff's office has not yet confirmed whether charges will be made, but if Woodburn was found guilty of a felony he would be barred from owning a gun.

Woodburn has not yet replied to a Mail Online request for comment.
