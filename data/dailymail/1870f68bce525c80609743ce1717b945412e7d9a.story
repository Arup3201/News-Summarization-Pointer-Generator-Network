The storm around the 'Carrier IQ' software used in US mobile phones has led US Senators to question the company, lawsuits, and questions over how many handsets carry the monitoring software - and what exactly it does

Spyware researcher Trevor Eckhart showed off a video this week demonstrating that 'Carrier IQ' - software buried deep within the operating systems of American mobiles to provide mobile carriers with information - might be snooping a little more than it should.

Eckhart's demonstration showed the software 'reading' the contents of text messages and web browsing on an HTC Android phone, and transmitting the information.

Since then, handset makers such as RIM, Nokia and Apple have rushed to distance themselves from the software - portraying the 'spyware' as an Android-only problem.

Since then, US Senator Al Franken has asked the software company to respond to Eckhart's claim - and an Illinois resident has filed a lawsuit against the company.

Illinois Erin Janek filed a lawsuit against Carrier IQ and handset maker HTC - which Eckhart used for his demonstration - alleging illegal interception of information.

Eckhart's demo showed that the software, which is supposed to provide mobile phone networks with information on how handsets are used, 'read' and transmitted the contents of SMS messages, and also monitored web browsing.

Carrier IQ - whose software is used on millions of handsets across the US - released a statement.

'While a few individuals have identified that there is a great deal of information available to the Carrier IQ software inside the handset, our software does not record, store or transmit the contents of SMS messages, email, photographs, audio or video,' the company said.

'For example, we understand whether an SMS was sent accurately, but do not record or transmit the content of the SMS. We know which applications are draining your battery, but do not capture the screen.'

It's still unclear whether the application does 'log' keystrokes - or, if so, how this data is used.

Handset makers rushed to distance themselves from the software, which is installed by phone networks to monitor usage.

Research In Motion RIM does not install, nor authorize, its carrier partners to install “Carrier IQ” monitoring software on its BlackBerry smartphones, the company said on Thursday.

RIM made the statement after a security researcher said the 'Carrier IQ' application, which can monitor what device users are doing, has been installed on mobile devices from multiple vendors without the knowledge or consent of customers.

Trevor Eckhart, the researcher who demonstrated in online videos how the software works, focused on devices using Google’s GOOG.O Android operating system, but he also mentioned other operating systems, including RIM’s BlackBerry and Nokia’s NOK1V.HE Symbian system as having the software installed.

Nokia also denied their phones used the software.

Handset makers such as Nokia, makers of the Lumia (pictured), said that Carrier IQ software was not installed on their handsets

'CarrierIQ does not ship products for any Nokia devices,' a company spokesman said.

U.S. Senator Al Franken asked software maker Carrier IQ to respond to claims by an independent security researcher that its products collect and transmit potentially sensitive data about millions of mobile phone users.

The video shows a piece of software tracking Eckhart as he turns his phone on and off, punches numbers to make a call and records text message in plain text.

'The revelation that the locations and other sensitive data of millions of Americans are being secretly recorded and possibly transmitted is deeply troubling,' Franken said in a statement. 'Carrier IQ has a lot of questions to answer.'

In his letter, he asked the company for details on the types of data its software collects and what it does with that information.

AT&T and Sprint Nextel both said they use the software in their devices to collect information that helps them improve network and service performance.

'We do use carrier IQ, but we do not and cannot look at the contents of messages, etc., as some have speculated,” said Sprint spokeswoman Stephanie Vinge-Walsh.

Apple Inc said that some devices, including iPhones, that run on its iOS 4 operating system use the Carrier IQ software, but that it does not work with the newer iOS 5.

In a statement posted to its website last month, Carrier IQ said its software is used by network operators to help improve network quality and troubleshoot device problems.

“While we look at many aspects of a device’s performance, we are counting and summarizing performance, not recording keystrokes, or providing tracking tools,” the Mountain View, California-based company said.

Since Eckhart’s videos first appeared, a firestorm of criticism has erupted in online forums and on Twitter, where users complain about breach of privacy.

Carrier IQ immediately tried to suppress Eckhart's report.

The
Electronic Freedom Foundation, an activist group which promotes free 
speech online, said, 'Carrier IQ fired off a cease-and-desist letter to 
Eckhart, claiming that he infringed its copyrights and made unspecified 
false allegations about its software.
