Four robbers who posed as builders in high-visibility jackets to carry out a series of 'blood chilling' raids at convenience stores have been jailed.

The gang tied up and beat staff in seven different shops before making off with £84,000 of cash, cigarettes and scratch cards.

Armed with axes and metal bars, the raiders barged into shops in the early hours of the morning, bound employees using cable ties and dumped them in a back room - before filling their bags.

Attack: The balaclava-clad gang broke into seven stores with axes and bars, tied up staff, and filled their bags

One member of staff suffered a heart attack during the ambush.

Today, Graham Aulton, 33, Stewart Ferguson, 35, Alan Britton, 40 and Craig Osmund-Smith, 41, were sentenced to a total of 31 years and 10 months in jail.

The gang planned and executed the string of raids last Autumn, Stafford Crown Court heard.

Shocking CCTV pictures show the raiders wearing black masks or tights over their heads and hi-visibility jackets as they launched their raids in the early hours of the morning.

During the first attack in Codsall, 
Staffordshire, on September 9, the gang threatened to 'cut up' staff 
members with an axe unless they handed over money and cigarettes, the 
court heard.

Judge Michael Fowler said: 'It takes little imagination to think of the kind of fear there must have been'

Judge Michael Fowler said: 'It is a significant factor of the robberies that the robbers where masked wearing dark clothing, balaclavas and gloves.

'Masks were often made with the legs of a pair of tights knotted and eye holes cut out. A scary prospect.

'On occasion weapons were taken and threats made that would have been blood chilling. There was intimidation by urgency.

'There was total disregard for the feelings and well-being of those who were in the stores when the robberies took place demonstrated graphically by CCTV.

'It takes little imagination to think of the kind of shock and fear there must have been when someone opens a back door of premises expecting to take in the papers and milk but to find it pushed open and confronted by masked dark clothed robbers.'

The second raid, at a Tesco in Wolverhampton, saw staff handcuffed to a metal rail in the store while they raided the shelves.

A raid in Shrewsbury on October 16 saw a staff member kicked in the face while during the next in Ashmore Park, Wolverhampton, the thugs made off with a store manager’s BMW.

They also targeted stores in Womborne, and Penkridge, both Staffordshire, and Gornal, West Midlands.

After making sure the staff were out of the way the criminals bundled their loot into brightly-coloured builders bags.

The bags were used on each occasion and the offenders covered their faces using black balaclavas or ladies stockings which were cut and knotted.

Police arrested Osmund-Smith, Aulton, and Ferguson on November 5 last year as the trio arrived at the Sainsbury’s Local in Wordsley, West Mids.., in the stolen BMW.

Aulton was in the driver’s seat tried to speed off but crashed into an unmarked police car.

Mobile phone records showed the group exchanged text messages just before and after the robberies.

Aulton, from Wednesfield, West 
Midlands, was jailed for eight years and nine months after admitting 
conspiracy to commit robbery.

Britton, from Wolverhampton, was sentenced to seven years and seven months after admitting the same charge.

Osmund-Smith from Dudley, West 
Midlands, was also jailed for six years and nine months after he pleaded
 guilty to the same charge.

Ferguson, from Bilston, West Midlands,
 denied the charge but was unanimously found guilty by a jury of 
conspiracy to commit robbery and was jailed for eight years and nine 
months.

Speaking after the sentence, Detective Superintendent Paul Clews, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'These victims are hard-working shop workers going about their daily business and it is they and the wider community who suffer when organised criminals believe they will be immune from prosecution.'
