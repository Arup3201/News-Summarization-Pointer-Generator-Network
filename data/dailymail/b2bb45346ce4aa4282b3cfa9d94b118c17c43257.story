Caught: 36-year-old Joseph M. Bekken was charged Thursday in 1st District Court with attempting to procure a prostitute, attempting to misuse public money, bribery, using a computer in a scheme to defraud and burglary

The former financial aid director at North Idaho College is accused of offering scholarship money to students in exchange for sex.

Joseph M. Bekken, 36, was charged Thursday in 1st District Court with attempting to procure a prostitute, attempting to misuse public money, bribery, using a computer in a scheme to defraud and burglary.

Bekken, a married father of four who has been fired, was being held in the Kootenai County Jail on $100,000 bail on the felony charges.

'This is conduct that has been going on for many, many years,' Kootenai County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Jedediah Whitaker told Judge Scott Wayman.

Whitaker said that Bekken came to North Idaho College in 2010 from his previous job as a financial aid counselor at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona.

Police said Bekken at North Idaho College advertised on Craigslist for several semesters and agreed to meet a female student at a Coeur d'Alene apartment complex on February 2nd.

According to police documents through the Coeur d' Alene Police Department, officers were notified by the FBI of ads targeting NIC students. FBI Agents and Spokane Detectives working internet crimes responded to ads that said 'Hello, I have a proposition for NIC students.' 

The message detectives received was 'I have some grant money that I can get applied to your account. I just look for some fun in return.'

With the approval of NIC President Joe Dunlap Coeur d' Alene, officers created a fake student account and responded to the NIC ads again. The response officers got back was the same as before, 'I have some extra grant money to allocate. Just looking for some potential fun on the side.' Officers asked what they would have to do and were told, 'I'm completely open. Sex, oral, etc...watching.'

The next day he received a reply stating, 'i have some extra grant money to allocate. looking for individuals who can and want to receive it. just looking for some potential fun on the side.'

The email conversation continued over the next 10 days and included an exchange of photos, with an male undercover police detective using female images he found online with no visible faces. At one point the officer, writing as 'Sheryl Roberts,' wrote about being uncomfortable with the situation.

The response, allegedly from Bekken, was, 'Well, I'm really antsy honestly. I've never done anything like this and I hope it doesn't come back to bite me. Anyhow, I hope you are discreet and I will be to (sic). If this works, we can keep it going for future semesters.'

A few days later the detective received emails about the scholarship money and how to access it. They arranged to meet 11am February 2 at what the undercover officer said was 'her' residence, an apartment on Julia Street behind a Lowe's store.

When Bekken knocked on the door, the detective and an FBI agent approached him and took him to the police station for an interview. 

Police say Bekken agreed to be interviewed by police on February 2nd and said he'd also been using Craigslist in Arizona to set up sexual encounters. 

Bekken said he used Craigslist to find others, mostly men, for casual sexual encounters when he worked at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona. 

Bekken said a few semesters ago he got the idea to offer scholarship money for sex and posted his offer to NIC students in the 'casual encounters' section of Craigslist, according to a police report.

He said, police reported, that when he moved to Idaho he got the idea to trade scholarship money for sex.

Bekken ultimately deposited a total of $587 in grants into the student account before being detained at a meet-up arranged by police. 

The college fired Bekken later that day, and Coeur d'Alene police arrested him Wednesday, when he was booked into the Kootenai County Jail. 

Bekken told police he hadn't successfully arranged any such encounters. Bekken is married and has four children. 

In Boise, state officials expressed shock over the allegations but said they're confident NIC and police are responding appropriately.

'This is just very much an anomaly and I just don't know what to say,' said Don Soltman, who represents North Idaho on the state Board of Education, which oversees all public higher education institutions in Idaho.

Blake Youde, spokesman for the state board, said financial aid personnel at Idaho's colleges and universities are professionals who take their jobs seriously.

'I am confident that this is not a standard situation,' Youde said. 

Bekken previously worked as a financial aid counselor at Grand Canyon University and at the University of Phoenix.

Whitaker, the prosecutor, in statements made in court on Thursday left it unclear why Bakken left Grand Canyon University in Phoenix.

Judge Wayman denied Bekken's request for a public defender, noting the job he had at North Idaho College had paid him about $74,000 a year. 

It wasn't clear on Friday if Bekken had hired a private attorney.
