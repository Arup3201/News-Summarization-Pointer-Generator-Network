Danny Ings' double on his home ground led England to an impressive 3-1 win over Portugal at Turf Moor.

The Burnley striker scored in the sixth minute and then again in the second half, while Carl Jenkinson also got on the scoresheet for England.

Relive all the action as it happened below. 

Host commentator

A very good night at the office for England and they head to France for their next game on Monday night.

That's all from me... see you soon!

A job very well done by England. They have played some really good football and scored three quality goals. It's a morale boosting win against the team who they will face in their Euro 2015 opener in Czech Republic in June.

Portugal played some good football as well, but their defending let them down. But also they look to be holding back a bit and not revealing their hand to England with that game in June to come.

England have now won 11 in a row and will head to France for a friendly in Brest on Monday after inflicting Portugal's first defeat in 15.

Three added minutes at Turf Moor.

Nathan Redmond is announced as man of the match with two minutes to play plus injury time. It was a close call between him and Ings, who scored twice.

I probably would have given it to Redmond as well.

Not long left now and there's a party atmosphere in the crowd.

A standing ovation for Danny Ings as he is replaced with 11 minutes to play. The night couldn't have gone much better for him - two goals on home soil.

Bamford is the man to replace him while Robinson also comes on for Garbutt.

England almost home here, but need to keep their concentration.

A good night's work for Redmond comes to an end as he is replaced by Alex Pritchard with 18 minutes to play.

Redmond has been a problem for Portugal's defence all night.

20 minutes to go in Burnley and Portugal are the team on the front foot now. England are defending very deep and allowing their visitors to apply pressure.

So far, though, Southgate's side are holding firm and still maintaining a threat on the counter attack. Ings was clean through a minute ago with a chance for his hat-trick... but he was also yards offside.

A number of changes for Portugal. Chalobah came on for Hughes for England as well.

Two-goal cushion restored for England. Once again Portugal were opened up very easily.

Redmond did very down the left as he beat his defender and cut the ball back low for Ings to slot in from close range.

England have had to do some defending at the start of the second half, but that goal should settle them. Very good response.

Portugal must have had a message at half-time to start pushing on and having a go at England. In the first half they were timid in possession and often just went from side to side.

In eight minutes of second-half action they have already tested England more than they did in the entire first half. 

England need to be a bit more cautious at the back, but there are still plenty of opportunities going forward, especially on the counter attack.

Game on again in Burnley. Lovely finish from Bernardo Silva through the legs of Butland and Portugal are back in it.

England look to have been caught cold there after the restart, and suddenly their lead is not so comfortable now.

45 minutes to got then and we're underway in the second half.

'More of the same please' would have been the message from Southgate in the dressing room at half-time.

Half-time in Burnley and it's looking good for England at the moment. They have scored two really good goals and looked very dangerous in possession. Portugal, for all their possession, never really threatened England and have also struggled to contain the likes of Ings, Redmond and Ince.

I'll be back for the second half very shortly, but here's Dom King's views on the action so far:

'This is a big night for some of these England players. Gareth Southgate has a rough idea of what his 23-man party for the Czech Republic will be and a few of this group need to stake a claim. One man who is doing so is Tom Ince. He has been heavily involved and is taking the chance to impress the head coach. Will Hughes, too, has built on his outstanding performance in Croatia. So far it is a case of a job being very well done.'

No 2 for England! Again it was lovely, intricate build-up play and Will Hughes' cut back from the left channel went all the way through to Jenkinson, who arrived into the penalty box late and slotted in England's second.

An excellent finish from the young Arsenal right back and England double their advantage. Portugal very poor defensively.

Hughes has the ball in the back of the net, but was offside from Ings' ball through. No arguments there, the Derby man was a couple of yards off.

Much better football from England over the last few minutes. They have been the team taking the game to the opposition and looking menacing. Portugal had a lot of possession earlier but never really troubled England, but on the other hand England look dangerous whenever they come forward.

Five minutes until half-time.

Portugal are dominating possession at the moment and moving the ball around really well, but without testing the England back line.

England's pacy attacking players like Ince and Redmond are being given plenty of space to work with due to the pattern of the game. Portugal's midfield are very narrow when they defend and there are some gaps for England to exploit.

33 minutes played - 1-0 to England.

Garbutt has gotten forward from left back a couple of times and put in some dangerous crosses, the latest of which was spilled by Portugal goalkeeper Silva.

Pace of the game has slowed down somewhat. England are having to work very hard without possession as Portugal are becoming more and more comfortable in possession.

20 minutes gone at Turf Moor and signs that Portugal are starting to settle into the game now. They've had some possession in midfield and come forward well once or twice.

Fernandes just had a go from 20 yards, but dragged his shot wide of the far post.

Sportsmail's Dom King is wrapped up warm in position at Turf Moor. Here is an update from him...

'Turf Moor felt different in the minutes before kick-off as the usual soundtrack, which features David Bowie, The Foo Fighters and Arcade Fire, was replaced by some atmospheric music. Some things here remain the same and that is Danny Ings scoring in front of the Jimmy McIlroy Stand. Ings has had to play second fiddle to Harry Kane and Saido Berahino in the qualification programme but he is taking this opportunity to show Gareth Southgate why he should go to the Czech Republic next summer.'

England once again carved right through Portugal and the visitors were lucky that the offside flag went up against Ince after Redmond played him through.

England's wide players having a lot of joy at the moment and Portugal need to weather this storm.

England look full of pace and creativity every time they come forward. Portugal are being pushed back very deep at the moment and can't get a foot on the ball.

Impressive opening 10 minutes from Southgate's side.

Danny Ings! England take the lead!

Perfect start for Gareth Southgate's side in Burnley and it's local boy Ings who opens the scoring in just the sixth minute.

Ince did very well in the right channel to stay onside and then pick out Ings with a low cross. The Burnley striker did the rest with a clinical finish from six yards to give England the lead. Just rewards for a fast start.

A purposeful run from Ings through the centre gets his home Burnley crowd excited. The striker laid the ball out to the right and then just couldn't get on the end of the return cross into the box.

Bright start from England.

National anthems done and dusted at Turf Moor. Burnley's own striker Danny Ings in particular looks raring to go.

Portugal kick us off and we're underway.

These two teams will meet in their opening Group B fixture at the Euro U21 finals in Czech Republic next summer. Alongside these two will be Italy and Sweden while Group A is made up of hosts Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark and Serbia.

Gareth Southgate just told BT Sport that 'the hard work starts now'. In Portugal, they certainly will have their work cut out. This team won all 10 of their qualification matches, including both legs of the play-off against Holland in a 7-4 aggregate win.

10 minutes to go until kick-off in Burnley.

Portugal starting line-up: Silva, Figueiredo, Alves, Neves, Silva, Pereira, Esgaio, Fernandes, Ruben, Bangna, Venancio.

And the benches...

England: Robinson, Bond, Lascelles, Chalobah, Pritchard, Bamford, Kane, Woodrow, Wilson, Bettinelli.

Portugal: Fernandes, Gaspar, Oliveira, Cancelo, Vezo, Sturgeon, Teixeira.

Harry Kane starts from the bench for England tonight and there is no Saido Berahino - the star of qualifying - as he is in Roy Hodgson's senior squad.

England's starting XI for tonight is as follows...

Butland, Jenkinson, Garbutt, Hughes, Gibson, Keane, Ince, Forster-Caskey, Ings, Carroll, Redmond.

Good evening one and all, welcome to our coverage of tonight's U21 clash between England and Portugal in Burnley.

This should be a good one. We have two in form teams who have both qualified for next year's European Under 21 Championship in Czech Republic and they'll meet again in their Group B opener at the finals in June.

Kick-off is around 30 minutes away and team news will follow very shortly. So sit back, relax and get comfortable.
