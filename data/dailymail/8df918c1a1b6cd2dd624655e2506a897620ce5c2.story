Court: Philip Maine was caught using hidden cameras to secretly capture hotel room sex at motoring get togethers

A car enthusiast who secretly filmed couples having sex at Mini enthusiasts' away days has apologised for the 'pain' he caused because of his perverted actions.

Philip Maine was caught using hidden cameras to secretly capture couples in hotel rooms at motoring get-togethers.

The 40-year-old avoided a jail sentence over his sordid crimes; but said he was glad he had been caught - despite losing his friends in the process.

'I made a mistake and I got caught, I'm glad I got caught,' he said.

'I’ve lost a lot of friends. I’m just very sorry for the pain and anguish I caused.'

Maine, of Henley-in-Arden, West Midlands, was caught out last November when a camera he placed in a friend's bathroom was found during a dinner party.

Police found another mini-camera on Maine and a third at his home.

He told officers he had filmed people in hotel rooms while they were away at get-togethers.

Detectives found 23 images of women on a laptop.

He told the Birmingham Mail he had been cast out of the tight-knit community of Mini enthusiasts over his offences.

He said: 'I have to keep my head down, pay my dues, get on with work and life and try to rebuild trust.

'I’ve had no contact with the Mini community since I was arrested. I hurt a lot of people and I’m very sorry.'

He admitted five charges of voyeurism 
at Warwick Crown Court - offences which also saw him film up womens' 
skirts in a supermarket.

Sentencing
Maine, Judge Marten Coates told him: 'The worst thing about this case 
is the psychological distress you have caused to your victims.

'The public would say you deserve to go to prison.

'But the maximum sentence is very short indeed and this is not the worst category of seriousness.

'If I did that, you would be out in a very short time and would be the same person.'

Maine was ordered to sign as a sex offender for five years, undergo a treatment programme as part of a community sentence and pay £340 costs.

Liz D’Olivera, defending, said Maine bought the cameras for legitimate purposes and was 'extremely remorseful'.

'He says he did not realise the implications and the ripple effect it would have, affecting not only the women concerned, but their partners and friends,' she said.
