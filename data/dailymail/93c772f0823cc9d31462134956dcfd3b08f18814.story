An Oxford graduate who trained to become a Church of England priest was last night charged with rape and attempted rape.

Timothy Storey, 34, from Peckham, South London, was charged with one count of rape, two counts of attempted rape, one count of sexual assault by penetration and one count of sexual assault by touching.

He was charged a day after being arrested by Metropolitan detectives.

Appearance: Storey will appear via video-link at Bromley Magistrates Court in Kent

Scotland Yard said the alleged offences were committed against a woman in her 20s in March.

Storey was kept in custody, and will appear before Bromley magistrates in Kent tomorrow by  video-link.

Originally from Folkestone in Kent, Storey studied theology at Oxford, and was married to a lawyer who also graduated from Oxford. The couple have been separated for a year.

Although Storey was unable to become a C of E priest, he worked at a London parish as an administrative assistant.
