A relaxed and sensibly-dressed Prince Anne attended the Six Nations International Rugby Union Match between Scotland and Wales at Murrayfield  today.

The Princess Royal, 64, looked cheerful in a green tweed double-breasted coat and matching trousers.

A long-time supporter of Scotland, she chatted to members of both teams before kick-off at 3pm at the Edinburgh stadium.

Princess Anne meets the Wales and Scotland rugby teams before Six Nations kick off in Edinburgh today

The royal wore a green tweed double breasted jacket and matching trousers at Murrayfield stadium

Anne, who has a long relationship with the sport as a patron on Scottish Rugby Union and Gloucestershire Rugby Football Union, was introduced to both sides 

She enjoyed some pre-match small talk with Wales's Jamie Roberts.

Then Anne, who wore a matching green polo neck under her jacket, also talked to Scotland's Geoff Cross and seemed to rib him about his beard.

Ever practical, she wore her hair back in its signature up-do, kept her hands warm with leather gloves and made sure she could walk steadily across the pitch in sturdy black shoes. 

She laughed and talked to Scotland's Geoff Cross as well as Wales' Jamie Roberts before 3pm kick-off

The royal has an added attraction to the sport as her son Peter Phillips also played for Scotland under-18s while he was at Gordonstoun school in Scotland. 

Meanwhile her son-in-law Mike Tindall is a former England rugby player.

He and Zara are close to Anne and rent a home on her 730-acre Gatcombe Park estate.
