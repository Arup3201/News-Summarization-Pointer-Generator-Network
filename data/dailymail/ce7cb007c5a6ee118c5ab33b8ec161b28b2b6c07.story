French first lady Valerie Trierweiler was today forced to pay legal costs to a writer who accused her of being the ‘shared’ mistress of two married politicians.

It follows Ms Trierweiler withdrawing her claim of defamation against Christophe Jakubyszyn, who exposed the 48-year-old’s extraordinarily colourful love life.

Mr Jakubyszyn and fellow TV journalist Alix Bouilhaguet wrote a book called ‘La Frondeuse’ (The Troublemaker) which Ms Trierweiler originally wanted pulped.

It reveals how she was regularly sleeping with 58-year-old Francois Hollande, the future Socialist president, at the same time as former conservative minister Patrick Devedjian, now 68.

Ms Trierweiler, who works for the glossy celebrity magazine Paris Match, was still married to fellow journalist Denis Trierweiler while the affairs were taking place in the early 2000s.

Both men were aware they were ‘sharing’ Ms Trierweiler, but when Mr Devedjian refused to leave his wife, she stuck with Mr Hollande, says the book.

Mr Hollande was still with Segolene Royal, the mother of his four children, at the time of the four year-long affair, the book alleges.

Ms Trierweiler has never directly denied the accusations, and has now abandoned her libel claim for £90,000.

This is despite the first lady winning a privacy case against the writers, using notoriously strict French legislation designed to protect the personal lives of public figures from public scrutiny.

Following the withdrawal of the defamation case, Ms Trierweiler has to pay the equivalent of £2,150 to Mr Jakubyszyn to cover legal expenses, and the same amount to his publishers.

Ms Trierweiler’s humiliation was blamed by her barrister, Frederique Giffard, ‘purely on procedure.’

He pointed to the fact that she was awarded the equivalent of more than £10,000 by the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris following her successful privacy case earlier this year.

But the journalists both insist that their account of Ms Trierweiler’s past was the result of an ‘honest investigation’ meant to illustrate ‘the overbearing closeness between politicians and political journalists’.

Despite being a journalist for a magazine which regularly features intimate details of people’s private lives, Ms Trierweiler has become notoriously litigious since moving into the Elysee Palace last year.

She successfully sued Paris Match rivals Voici and Closer for publishing swimsuit pictures of her and Mr Hollande on a private beach.

Ms Trierweiler has not commented on her latest court reversal, which was announced in an official court order late on Monday.

She is herself facing a legal action over claims that the taxpayer should not be supporting her lifestyle as the ‘president’s mistress’.

Xavier Kemlin, a supermarket chain heir, launched the complaint earlier this year, saying: ‘It is scandalous that our taxes are being used to house, feed, upkeep and pay for the staff and travel of a lady to whom we have no legal obligation.’
