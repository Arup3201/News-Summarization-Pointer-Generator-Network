Residents have complained they are being kept awake by an 'explosive' manhole which  can be heard up to half a mile away.

People living in the Homewood Road area of Tenterden, in Kent, has said the sound caused by cars driving over the metal plates is 'like a shotgun' going off. 

The noise has become an issue since the middle of July, when the busy A28 was resurfaced in the town.

Resident Lizzie Spring, 64, said: 'It's like a shotgun going off every time a car drives over it. I get woken up many times during the night, and I know a lot of my neighbours do as well' 

People living in Tenterden, in Kent, have complained about the sound of cars driving over the metal plates

Lizzie Spring, 64, a retired osteopath, has lived in a house near the offending cover on the corner of Homewood Road and Ashford Road for a year.

She said: 'Until they resurfaced the road, the cover was no louder than any other manhole cover.

'The A28 is a busy road, but my house has good double glazing, so I could barely hear the traffic.

'But now, since they resurfaced the road, every time a car drives past you can hear a massive explosive bang.'

She added: 'It's so loud. Any percussion orchestra would be proud to make a sound like that.'

Ms Spring has complained to Kent County Council about the manhole cover and the Council sent a highways inspector to look at it. 

She said: 'Worryingly, the inspector said he did not know who owned the cover, whether it was the water board, electric or someone else.

'There are no markings on it. Until they find out who owns it, I don't think they can fix it.

'But in the meanwhile, the sound is getting louder all the time.

'It's like a shotgun going off every time a car drives over it. I get woken up many times during the night, and I know a lot of my neighbours do as well.'

Ms Spring has complained to the council about the manhole cover, which is claimed to be the loudest in Britain

One resident said: 'I can't imagine it would be possible for one (manhole cover) to be louder' 

Another resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said the noise is so unbearable he might even contemplate moving to a house close to Gatwick Airport.

He said: 'Every night it's the same banging.

'We might move under the Gatwick flight path because jumbo jets are probably quieter.

'Something needs to be done, before lack of sleep causes us to lose our minds.

'This must be the loudest one in Britain. I can't imagine it would be possible for one to be louder.'

A spokesman for Kent County Council said they are aware of the manhole cover and are investigating.
