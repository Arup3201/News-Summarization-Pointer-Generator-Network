Stafford Ray has spoken of how he feels sorry for the killer's family and does not want revenge 

Mr Ray explained how he shook the hands of McKnight's parents and hugged his mother after the trial.  

He told Channel 9: 'His (McKnight's) dad wrote me a little note about halfway through the trial, just saying how sorry he was, from the family. 

'I wrote him one back and then we saw each other later that day and shook hands.

'I gave Michael's mother a hug and said, 'You know we are not blaming you'. And you can't.

'You'd see these poor people there, just suffering. It was two families with two similar boys, in some ways.'

McKnight, who was addicted to drugs and suffered from schizophrenia was off his medicine the night of the killing, did not know he had killed Mr Ray. 

Michael McKnight was found guilty of manslaughter and ordered to serve six years in prison 

During McKnight's trial the court heard that he had heard voices in his head telling him to attack someone. 

Mr Ray told Channel 9: 'They were suffering more, in some ways it's worse for them.'

Scott Weber, Police Association President, told Channel 9: 'What we are seeing is police officers being a stop gate measure in regards to this massive health issue.'

McKnight was found not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter and was jailed for six years.

Scott Weber, Police Association President, said police are dealing with more and more mental health issues
