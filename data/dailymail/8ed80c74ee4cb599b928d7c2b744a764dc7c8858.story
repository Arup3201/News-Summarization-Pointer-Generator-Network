Cotto became the first Puerto Rican fighter to win world championships in four weight divisions, stopping Sergio Martinez in their WBC world middleweight title fight on Saturday. 

'It was a reflection of my hard work (for) 10, 11 weeks,' Cotto said. 

Martinez didn't get off the stool when the bell rang for the 10th round. He did not speak to the media after the fight, as he was taken to a hospital as a precaution.
