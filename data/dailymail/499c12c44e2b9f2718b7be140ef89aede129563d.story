Three National Guardsmen who were killed in a senseless gun rampage have been pictured for the first time.

The Guardsmen were killed 
and two more people wounded in a shooting spree at a Nevada IHOP restaurant Tuesday morning, which left a total of five people dead and seven 
hurt.

Dozens of 911 calls made from in and
around the Nevada IHOP illustrate a terrifying scene as witnesses 
described the gunman who killed four, before turning his automatic 
weapon on himself.

Killed: Sgt. 1st Class Miranda McElhiney

Killed: Sgt. 1st Class Christian Riege

Killed: Major Heath Kelly

Dispatchers are heard trying to establish whether than one person was involved in the deadly rampage.

Fatal shootout: Eduardo Sencion, 32, opened fire at the restaurant, killing four people and wounding seven others before fatally shooting himself

The dead included three Nevada National Guard members, identified Wednesday as: Sgt. 1st Class Christian Riege, 38, of Carson City; Major Heath Kelly, 35, of Reno; and Sgt. 1st Class Miranda McElhiney, 31, of Reno.

Also killed was Florence Donovan-Gunderson, 67, of South Lake Tahoe.

After the killings, the gunman, 32-year-old Eduardo Sencion, turned the AK-47 on himself.

On tapes released Wednesday, desperate callers describe how victims are being gunned down in front of them inside the restaurant.

One caller said: 'In the IHOP! In the IHOP!'. 

'Now he’s coming back out with a gun shooting people in the parking lot!'.

In another call, a man said, 'Automatic weapons. IHOP. Automatic weapons.'

'He's shooting at us now,' the man screamed, to a background of gunfire.

In interviews with investigators after the shooting, Sencion's family raised concerns about his mental health.

The attack took place at the pancake chain's restaurant in Carson City at around 9am on Tuesday. The fourth fatality was a female civilian.

A group of five military personnel were wearing their Nevada National Guard uniforms for a breakfast meeting when Sencion struck.

Authorities were not saying whether 
Sencion targeted the Guard members but security at all bases in Northern
Nevada was stepped up in response.

Carson City Sheriff Kenny Furlong said Sencion worked at his family's business in South Lake Tahoe.

He was not in the military, and he had no known affiliations with anyone at the restaurant. Sencion also had no criminal history.

At least one of the Guard 
members killed was a woman, authorities said. Sencion was born in Mexico and had a valid U.S. passport.

Witnesses said the gunman pulled up 
outside the IHOP in a blue minivan at just before 9am, with a yellow 'Support Our Troops' sticker on the back, and shot a woman on a
motorcycle, then walked inside the restaurant.

Sencion went all the way to the back of the restaurant where the Guards were sitting and opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle.

Shooting: Emergency personnel respond to the massacre at the IHOP restaurant in Carson City, Nevada

After several minutes inside the IHOP, he walked outside and 
began firing into the Locals Barbecue and an H&R Block in the strip 
mall.

Two of the four fatalities died at the scene. A third died during surgery and the fourth later.

Carson
City Sheriff Kenny Furlong said the suspected gunman was found by 
authorities in the IHOP parking lot, having 'already self-inflicted a 
wound'.

Carson City Sheriff's Office have confirmed the suspected shooter died in hospital in Reno.

Chief Deputy Jack Freer said: 'The suspect did die of a self inflicted gunshot wound. No shots were fired by law enforcement.'

Sheriff Furlong said there were 
concerns at the outset that the gunman was not working alone and the 
state Capitol and Supreme Court buildings were locked down for about 40 
minutes in response.

But that turned out not to be the case. 'There
does not appear to be any safety concerns outside of this area,' he 
said. 'It appears to be isolated to this parking lot.'

Aftermath: With bullet holes seen in a window, officers look for evidence at the scene

Semi-automatic weapon: Officers look through a bullet-damaged window of the restaurant

National
Highway Patrol Trooper Chuck Allen said extra security measures have 
been put in place on state and military buildings in northern Nevada as a
safety precaution.

'As you know when you have people in uniform who are randomly targeted for whatever reason this may have been, it is a safety precaution we take very seriously,' he said.

Some victims have been transported by Careflight to Renown in Reno. 
Others have been transported to Carson-Tahoe Medical Center. It was not clear where exactly the shooter was taken.

Ralph Swagler, owner of Locals Barbecue in the same strip mall as the 
IHOP, told the Reno 
Gazette-Journal that he saw the entire incident.

'This happens in third-world countries, not here,' Mr Swagler said. 'I wish I had shot at him when he was going in the IHOP.

'But when he came at me, when somebody is pointing an automatic weapon at you - you can't believe the firepower, the kind of rounds coming out of that weapon.'

Shocking: Emergency personnel respond to the shooting at the pancake house which left at least three dead

Consultation: Local and state police as well as FBI agents descended on the location of the shooting

Local and state police and FBI agents descended on the scene on South Carson Street, also called U.S. 395.

Yellow tape surrounded the parking 
lot at the restaurant, which is near a Kohl’s department store and 
across the street from a casino and hotel.

At least 11 agencies, both federal and state, are working the scene, Sheriff Furlong said.

Renown Regional Medicare Center 
spokesman Dan Davis said four victims of the shooting were being treated
at the hospital in Reno, but he said he could not discuss their 
condition or provide any other information.

Kurt Althof, public relations manager
for Care Flight, told the Reno Gazette-Journal three victims had been taken 
to the hospital by helicopter and that two were in critical condition.

Fran Hunter, who works at Sierra Le Bone, a pet shop, just north of the IHOP, was having breakfast at the Casino Fandango when the gunman attacked, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported.

As she came out of the casino, two men on motorcycles said they heard shots.

Victim: The body of a shooting victim covered with a sheet lies on the front lawn of the IHOP restaurant

Ms Hunter said Sencion came out of IHOP and shot out the windows of the barbecue place. He fired shot at least two shots toward Casino Fandango.

'I was standing in front of Fandango, and somebody said, "Oh he shot himself,"' Ms Hunter told the Reno Gazette-Journal.

'I don't know what's happening to my city,' she said. 'This happens in LA or Las Vegas but not here.'

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, has released a statement reading: 'I'm deeply saddened by this senseless act and extend my sympathies to those afflicted this morning.

'I applaud the first responders for their professionalism, and my thoughts are with the victims and their families during this difficult time.'

Sheriffs are interviewing more than 100 witnesses at the scene.

Jayne Peters of Carson City was taking a tax class at H&R Block with five other students when the shooting started.

'Just as we were starting, I heard a pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, and I said: "Is that automatic gunfire?"' she told the Reno Gazette-Journal.

Ms Peters said her instructor looked out the window and saw a man with a gun and told all the students to get into the back of the office.

The instructor said the shooter first shot at Casino Fandango across the street, then went into the IHOP.

When Sencion exited the IHOP, he opened fire again. The blasts shattered the glass door of H&R Block.

'I kept thinking he was in our building,' Ms Peters told the Reno Gazette-Journal. 'We were just huddled in the bathroom in the dark. It was really scary.'
