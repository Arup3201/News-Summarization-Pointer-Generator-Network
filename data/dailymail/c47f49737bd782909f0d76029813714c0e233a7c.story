Last time she offered grunge circa 1992 reworked for the Noughties and, as the campaign images for A/W13 show, Rihanna clearly believes she has a winning formula on her hands.

Like her first effort, the new 80-piece collection focuses heavily on sports-luxe, but has been updated for autumn with moody shades of oxblood, grey as well as punk-inspired prints.

Other trends ticked off by the singing superstar include metallic and camouflage, while Rihanna's favourite mesh fabric also appears in the collection.

Rihanna's new collection revisits the sporty-punk theme of her sell-out debut effort

The 80-piece collection will be launched in two batches, with the first arriving on September 12th

Although the series of images released to mark the launch of the campaign don't feature Rihanna herself, the models' elegant plaits and tousled bobs come courtesy of Rihanna's personal hair stylist, Yusef Williams.

The photographs, which feature some of fashion's hottest new stars, were shot by New York-based photographer, Lachlan Bailey, who has previously worked for Dior, Fendi and Burberry among others.

Models Ji Hye Park, Nayasha Kusakina, Milou Van Grossen and Tati Cotliar were styled by Mel Ottenberg and the shoot was personally overseen by the singer.

Rihanna's last collection for River Island proved hugely popular, helped by a well-received show at London Fashion Week in February and some well-timed comments on the national dress sense.

'Britain has the most fashionable kids in the world,' the singer said ahead of her debut show. 'These kids inspired the high-end designers, they say what's cool.'

The last campaign proved similarly cool and featured supermodel Jourdan Dunn, although the styling in that instance was done by Rihanna herself.

As with the summer collection, fans won't have to wait long to get their hands on Rihanna's latest sartorial offering, with the first batch due to go on sale on the 12th September and the second following in November.

Pieces will be available in selected River Island stores globally and online, and will be sold exclusively in the United States and Japan at Opening Ceremony.

Among the top trends featured in the collection are camouflage, metallic and punk
