'Great training session Today. Almost Ready!' Valdes tweeted.

'Thanks for your supportive messages throughout these months. They have helped me a lot!'

Valdes has been strongly linked with a move to Louis van Gaal's side once any injury concerns are behind him and the 32-year-old is keen to discuss all possibilities.

The club remain in talks with David de Gea over a new contract but are keen to improve the 23-year-old's competition and Valdes would certainly fit the bill.
