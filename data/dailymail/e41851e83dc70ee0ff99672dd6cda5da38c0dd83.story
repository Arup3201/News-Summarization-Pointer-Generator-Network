Demetri Marchessini (pictured) was Ukip's sixth largest donor last year according to recently released figures

A major Ukip donor claimed yesterday that a husband can never rape his wife, insisting: ‘Once a woman accepts, she accepts.’

Demetri Marchessini, a retired Greek business tycoon, also said black slaves had a ‘much better life’ than they would have had in Africa, gays are incapable of fidelity and women should be banned by law from wearing trousers.

His bizarre outburst is the latest embarrassment to hit Ukip, which has been forced to distance itself from eccentric and offensive views of a string of candidates and supporters in recent weeks.

Despite the setbacks, the party recorded its best-ever poll result yesterday, with ComRes suggesting it was on course to secure 38 per cent of the vote in this month’s European elections.

Mr Marchessini was Ukip’s sixth largest  individual cash donor last year.

The party  suggested it would have nothing more to  do with him after he expressed what it  called ‘unpalatable’ views, but deputy  chairman Neil Hamilton said last night that while his remarks were ‘eccentric’, it would continue to accept his cash.

In his first TV interview, Mr Marchessini insisted there was ‘no such thing’ as rape within marriage.

‘When you get married you promise to look after the other person for the rest of their life,’ he tolfd Channel 4 News.

‘If you make love on Friday and make love Sunday, you can’t say Saturday is rape.

‘Once a woman accepts, she accepts and especially when she makes a vow on her wedding day.’

He said he
 believed women should be banned by law from wearing anything other than
 skirts, adding that they must dress to excite men.

‘May
 I tell you that the incidences of love-making in Western Europe has 
fallen drastically,’ he said.  ‘If men don’t make love to women the 
Western world is going  to disappear.’

Ukip has faced strong criticism over a host of opinions expressed by its candidates and supporters

A new ComRes survey for ITV News shows 38 per cent of people are planning to voe for Ukip on May 22 in the European Parliament elections

On homosexuals, Mr Marchessini said there was ‘no love only lust’ and there is ‘no such thing as fidelity’ in their relationships. ‘They just all go out looking for action,’ he said. ‘That’s the way it is.’

He also defended the slave trade, saying that those transported from Africa ‘had a much better duration of life and a better life in America’.

The tycoon said Ukip was ‘always’ asking for money and a previous declaration by a party spokesman that the party was distancing itself from him was ‘stupid’. When asked whether Ukip should take money from a man with such views, party leader Nigel Farage said: ‘Possibly not, no. Ask the treasurer. I don’t run everything.’

Mr Hamilton said: ‘It’s not dirty money. He has got eccentric views. We don’t endorse those views [but] what he says is not illegal.’

Despite the barrage of negative publicity a ComRes poll for ITV News yesterday put Ukip on course to win a resounding victory in the European elections.

It is on 38 per cent among those certain to vote – 11 points ahead of Labour, with the Conservatives on 18 per cent and the Liberal Democrats a miserable 8 per cent.
