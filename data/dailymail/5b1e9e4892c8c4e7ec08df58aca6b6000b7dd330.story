The BBC was under fire last night for treating hundreds of politicians, wealthy businessmen and its own staff to free tickets for Wimbledon.

While ordinary members of the public have to spend hundreds of pounds or queue overnight to get in to the All England Club, the Corporation doled out 382 free passes.

The beneficiaries included £2 million-a-year Premier League supremo Richard Scudamore – who shortly before this year’s tournament was embroiled in a row over sending sexist emails – and Christian Horner, the millionaire boss of Formula 1 team Red Bull.

The BBC has held the exclusive broadcasting rights to the tournament since 1927. As part of the deal, which is worth more than £20 million a year, the Corporation receives hundreds of Centre Court and Court One tickets

Senior BBC employees were given tickets, while junior staff were invited ‘as a reward for excellence at work’. But the broadcaster admitted guests were allowed to give away their tickets, raising the possibility they could have found their way into the hands of black-market touts.

Last night, critics hit out at the BBC for the giveaways, revealed in unprecedented detail following a Freedom of Information request by The Mail on Sunday.

Rob Wilson, Conservative MP for Reading East, said: ‘The BBC has once again been caught abusing the money of licence-fee payers.

‘Wimbledon tickets sprayed around to big companies who can afford their own is not what the BBC should be doing. Even if these tickets are part of a wider TV deal, it’s still a flagrant abuse.’

The BBC has held the exclusive broadcasting rights to the tournament since 1927. As part of the deal, which is worth more than £20 million a year, the Corporation receives hundreds of Centre Court and Court One tickets.

In response to the FoI request, the BBC admitted: ‘Across the 13 days of Wimbledon 2014, the BBC allocated 235 tickets for business purposes and 147 tickets either to staff as a reward for excellence at work or to individuals (mostly BBC staff) for personal use in return for a donation to charity.’

Of these, 40 tickets were for the highly coveted men’s and ladies’ singles finals.

Among those who enjoyed the finals thanks to the BBC were £255,000-a-year UK athletics chief executive Niels de Vos and his wife, Football League chairman Greg Clarke, Richard FitzGerald, chief executive of Racecourse Media Group, and American football’s UK chief Alistair Kirkwood.

Senior political figures were invited to other days of the tournament. Baroness Jones of Whitchurch went with fellow Labour peer Lord Collins, while Tory peer Patience Wheatcroft and Conservative MP Gareth Johnson also attended.

As well as Mr Scudamore, two other Premier League employees were invited, along with three from the Football League, four from the Football Association, and two each from Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal, plus one from Chelsea.

There were freebies too for Ian Holmes, Formula 1’s head of media rights, two members of the Mercedes F1 team, one from Williams, plus Mr Horner, the Red Bull team principal who is dating former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell.

Extraordinarily, the BBC admitted: ‘It is possible that some of the people listed did not use the tickets themselves, but instead passed them on to colleagues or associates.’

A spokesman added: ‘As is standard practice, the BBC uses some of its complimentary tickets for business purposes – at no cost to the licence-fee payer.

‘They are given to partners with whom BBC Sport works, as an opportunity to discuss further business, and to demonstrate first-hand one of the biggest events BBC Sport delivers.’
