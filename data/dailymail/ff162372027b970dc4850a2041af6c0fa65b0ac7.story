At first glance, he may seem like any other adorable kitten - but behind those wide eyes lies a tragic story.

The runt of a litter of seven, Mighty the stray became so cold after he was born that he lost the tops of his ears to frostbite.

The five-week-old cat, who lives at the Axhayes Cat Adoption Centre in Devon, is now desperate for a loving home - and an owner willing to look past his deformity.

Needs a home:  The Axhayes Cat Adoption Centre in Devon are trying to find a home for Mighty

The infant, who also lost a toe to the cold, was one of the first of his siblings to be born - and sadly when it came to nurturing her brood, his mother, Spire, forgot about tiny Mighty.

Phil Punnet, 57, deputy manager at the cat centre, said he believes the speed of the birth meant Mighty's 18-month-old mother did not have time to round up her young.

He said: 'The mother was in one of our maternity wards. When she started giving birth, the kittens were just popping out one after another. Mighty was one of the first and is the runt of the litter. 

'Kittens are just like children and you need to keep them warm. His mother didn't notice him and he hadn't been embraced or licked clean so was obviously not in a good way.

'We were able to warm him up when we got to him, but his ears came off about a week later and so did one toe.

'He's not out of the woods yet but he's coping well and we don't think his hearing will be seriously affected.

'He's playing with the other kittens and doesn't seem to think there is anything wrong with him. He's been to the vet a few times and they believe it was a case of him getting too cold after the birth.'

Mighty's mother was found on a farm near Tiverton, Devon, and was taken to the cat centre, near Exeter, where carers discovered she was heavily pregnant.

Within two weeks she had given birth to her brood, pushing the number of residents at the cat sanctuary up to around 180.

Phil added: 'Mighty might be small but he holds his own. He's just as playful as any other kitten and I think he will absolutely be able to find an owner. 

'We like to offer our kittens to people in pairs so siblings can stay together, as soon as Mighty has had his vaccinations he will be ready to go to a home.'

Anyone who would like to offer Mighty the kitten a new home should contact Phil via the Axhayes Cat Adoption Centre's website.
