Autism may be caused by a missing gene, it has emerged.

A team of scientists at Leeds University set out to investigate the gene neurexin-II, building on past research that has found some people diagnosed with autism are deficient in the gene. 

Mice who were deficient in the gene were found to display symptoms similar to autism in humans, including a lack of sociability or interest in other mice.   

Dr Steven Clapcote, of Leeds University, who led the study said: 'In other respects, these mice were functioning normally. The gene deficiency mapped closely with certain autism symptoms.

'This is exciting because we now have an animal model to investigate new treatments for autism.'

The researchers also looked at how the absence of neurexin-II affects the brain.

'We found that the affected mice had lower levels of a protein called Munc18-1 in the brain,' said co-author Dr James Dachtler, also of Leeds University.

Munc18-1 usually helps to release neurotransmitters - chemicals that take signals across the gaps between cells in the brain called synapses.

Lower levels of Munc18-1 mean the release of neurotransmitter chemicals could be impaired in the affected mice, and possibly in some cases of autism in humans, he said.

Previous research established a link between the symptoms of autism and neuroligin-1, another gene associated with carrying signals across synapses.

The Leeds-led study is the first to find a connection with neurexin-II.

Dr Clapcote said: 'Not all people with autism will have the neurexin-II defect, just as not all will have the neuroligin defect, but we are starting to build up a picture of the important role of genes involved in these synapse communications in better understanding autism.'

The study was published in the journal Translational Psychiatry.

People with autism may gather information from faces in a different way to their peers, which scientists believe could explain why they gain different perceptions from faces.

The discovery could help improve understanding of those diagnosed with autism, helping family members, friends and healthcare workers better communicate with them. 

Canadian researchers recruited 71 people, 33 people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 33 people without the disorder.

The participants were presented 36 pairs of photographic and synthetic images of emotionally neutral faces. They were asked to indicate which faces appear 'kind' to them.

With the photographic images, the judgements of the participants with ASD were mixed compared to the participants without the disorder. 

But the two groups made identical judgments about the synthetic images.

The identical results suggest it is not the judgement process itself that is different in people with ASD, but the way they gather clues in the first place.

'The evaluation of an individual's face is a rapid process that influences our future relationship with the individual,' said the study's lead author Baudouin Forgeot d'Arc, of the University of Montreal.

'By studying these judgments, we wanted to better understand how people with ASD use facial features as cues. Do they need more cues to be able to make the same judgment?'

He added: 'We now want to understand how the gathering of cues underpinning these judgments is different between people with or without ASD depending on whether they are viewing synthetic or photographic images.

'Ultimately, a better understanding of how people with ASD perceive and evaluate the social environment will allow us to better interact with them.'
