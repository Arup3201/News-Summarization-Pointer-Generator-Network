Their faces are barely able to conceal the stress and pain which they have endured this last six years.

Looking tired and tearful, Kate and Gerry McCann attended an evening ceremony in their village to mark the sixth anniversary of daughter Madeleine's disappearance .

The heartbroken couple attended the ceremony at the candle which burns continually in the centre of Rothley, Leicestershire.

Upsetting: Looking tired and tearful, Kate and Gerry McCann attended prayers and a candle lit service in their village to mark the sixth anniversary of the disappearance of their daughter Madeleine

Villagers marked the occasion with prayers and poems.

The low-key ceremony marks six years since Madeleine, then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in Portugal's Algarve on May 3 2007, as her parents dined at a tapas restaurant with friends nearby.

Earlier this week, her parents said their family, including twins Sean and Amelie, now eight, had found a 'new normality' since Madeleine's disappearance.

Mr and Mrs McCann, 44 and 45, said they continued to search for their daughter and remained as hopeful as ever - if not more so - as a case review by the Metropolitan Police was under way.

'In many ways things haven't changed and
 you could argue that, with the Met review two years in, we are actually
 in a better place because so much more information has been collated 
and lots of pieces of the jigsaw have been filled,' Mr McCann said.

'It's just about keeping looking, find out what's happened to Madeleine and hopefully finding those responsible.'

His wife said the Met Police seemed 'more determined than ever'.

The couple said although they struggled with various occasions, including Madeleine's birthday, they were coping with her absence.

'Probably the last couple of years it's been a new normality,' said Mr McCann.

'We have adapted to our situation.

'The thing for Kate and I was always 
about having a proper search and turning over every stone and we feel 
like that is being done.

'Of course we miss Madeleine terribly but we still hope that we will find her.

'We are still in the same situation and for us we have got to keep going until we find Madeleine and those responsible.'

Mrs
 McCann said twins Sean and Amelie, who were just two when their sister 
went missing, were coping well and were 'no different to any other 
eight-year-old child'.

'They
 have grown up knowing that Madeleine is missing, she is their big 
sister, we're trying to find her and she should be back home with us.

'As
 they get older and they wander on the internet and other things, there 
will be more questions, but going by how things have panned out so far I
 think we will be alright, I think they'll handle it well.'

February 6 - A DNA sample from a girl in New Zealand is sent to British
 police to quash the suggestion that she could be Madeleine McCann.

The couple admitted they found Madeleine's birthday - May 12 - more difficult than the anniversary of her disappearance.

'We
 both find that more difficult really because it's her special day and 
we should be there celebrating it and we still do,' Mrs McCann said.

'We still celebrate her anyway, and the same will happen this year, we have a little birthday tea and a cake.

'That's a much harder day for us really.'

But they insisted they have not given up hope and will continue the hunt for their daughter.

Mr McCann said: 'I think it's still about being vigilant and to remind people that we are looking for a 10-year-old girl, and not a three/four-year-old at the time.

'But if they have any information, they think they have seen someone who could be Madeleine, then the route is to contact the police.'

Mrs McCann added: 'I think to encourage everybody, it's six years on, but the way the Met review is going is really positive and with that, new hope.

'The search goes on, in a major way.'

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'Detectives from the Metropolitan Police Service continue their investigative review into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, liaising closely with the Portuguese authorities.'

Heartbreaking: Despite numerous high profile public appeals, Madeleine McCann has still not been found

Six years have passed since Madeleine McCann went missing on May 3, 2007 during a family holiday in Praia da Luz.

Since
 then, each word of Gerry and Kate McCann has been followed as they 
campaigned tirelessly to find Madeleine, and their words over the past 
six years provide an insight into their struggle.

Mr McCann issued the couple's first public appeal to trace Madeleine on May 5.

Visibly
 distraught, he released a personal appeal to anyone holding his 
daughter captive to release her: 'Please, if you have Madeleine, let her
 come home to her mummy, daddy, brother and sister.'

Mr and Mrs McCann met the Pope at the Vatican just over three weeks after their daughter disappeared.

Mr
 McCann spoke after the meeting, stating: 'I do not know how we will 
have changed but I think it is fair to say we will never be the same 
again.'

In their first interview since the disappearance of their daughter, Mr and Mrs McCann insisted they had not acted irresponsibly.

Mrs McCann said:'I think we were naive, we are very responsible parents, we love our children very much.

'I don't think any parent could imagine or consider anything like this happening.'

In September 2007, Mr and Mrs McCann returned home to Rothley, Leicestershire.

In the same month, they were also named by Portuguese police as formal suspects in the case.On
 the runway of East Midlands Airport, Mr McCann said: 'Despite there 
being so much we wish to say, we are unable to do so, except to say 
this: We played no part in the disappearance of our lovely daughter 
Madeleine.'

In January 2008, Mr McCann spoke of the guilt over his daughter's disappearance in an interview with an American magazine.

He
 said: 'I wish I hadn't gone to the tapas bar. I wish I'd stayed in the 
apartment that night. I wish I'd stayed in the room when I checked on 
her five minutes longer.'

In May 2008, Mrs McCann spoke to the 
congregation at a church in Rothley during a service to mark the 
one-year anniversary of her daughter's disappearance.

She said: 'Keep praying, pray like mad.'

In
 December 2009, Mrs McCann said she felt closer to her missing daughter 
Madeleine after returning to Praia da Luz for the first time since she 
was named as a prime suspect by police.

She said: 'Although our pain feels much rawer here, it is comforting at the same time since we feel closer to Madeleine.'

The couple spoke about the press intrusion into their case at the Leveson inquiry in 2011.Mrs McCann said: 'There was absolutely no respect shown for me as a grieving mother or a human being or to my daughter.'

In the couple's 
Christmas message on the Find Madeleine website as they prepared for 
their sixth Christmas without Madeleine, they wrote: 'We desperately 
hope of course that the official investigation to find Madeleine will be
 reopened - and soon - as we still believe this is probably our best 
chance of finding our little girl.'
