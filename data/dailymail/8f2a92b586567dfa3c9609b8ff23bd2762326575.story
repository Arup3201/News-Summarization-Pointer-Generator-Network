Nigeria appear to have won the battle to land Arsenal's highly-rated youngster Alex Iwobi.

Sportsmail revealed on Monday how the Super Eagles were trying to snatch the 18-year-old - who is Jay-Jay Okocha's nephew - from under England's noses.

Iwobi, who captains Arsenal's Under 21 side, has represented England at Under 16, 17 and 18 level.

However, the teenage forward has accepted an offer to join up with the Nigeria squad this week and now looks set to switch allegiances.

Iwobi, who has born in Nigeria, said: 'Ordinarily I would have loved to play for England since I have played for all the under-aged teams up to the U-19,

'But Austin Okocha and Nwankwo Kanu have influenced my decision to play for Nigeria.

'My dad too has told me a lot of things about the honour and pride that goes with playing for Nigeria.

'So I thought a lot about this and decided to play for Nigeria.'

However, until Iwobi plays a competitive senior match for the Super Eagles, then he is still eligible to play for England.
