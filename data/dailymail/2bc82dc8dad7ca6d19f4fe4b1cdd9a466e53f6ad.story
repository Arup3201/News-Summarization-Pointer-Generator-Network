A zoo once dubbed the 'worst in the world' by a visitorÂ is now set to close after complaints that the animals in residence were looking too depressed.

The Split Science Museum and Zoo in Croatia's second largest city, Split, will relocate its animals to different zoos across the country.

The announcement came after numerous complaints that the animals were living in squalid conditions, such as small and dirty cages, making them visibly depressed.

Trapped: Bears are kept in tiny cages, often seen restless and ill-treated, making them depressed and violent

The closure was announced by Split's deputy mayor, Goran Kovacevic, who said: 'We have told the zoo manager to start preparations and draft a programme
 to relocate all animals.'

The monkeys will be sent to Germany, but the zoos managers are still still looking for a housing solution for the zoo's 14-year-old tiger.

The establishment, open since 1924, previously housed 450 animals across 55 species.

Violent: Local animal rights groups have pointed out the troubles of the wolves (pictured), saying up to five of them were kept in a cage at once, causing them to constantly attack each other

Depressed: Animals, such as the pigs (pictured) are made to stick to squalid conditions, with tourists saying their cages and enclosures are cramped to the point of abuse

Utilitarian: The zoo is a mixture of old and rusting metal, cracked and poorly maintained concrete and small cages that are often too small to house as many cramped animals as they do

It has been the subject of scathing reviews on the review site Tripadvisor, with statements like 'disgraceful' and 'terrible' a frequent occurrence from visitors choosing to leave comments.

One visitor said: 'The zoo in Split is located at the very 
top of the Marjan Hill, unfortunately on the top of the hill you will find a
 very sad place and tears may easily wet your eyes.

'There is a 
small range of animals including bears, wolves, donkeys and monkeys.

'Some of the cages are ridiculously small and animals do not look happy
 at all.

The most shocking cage was for the biggest animals in the zoo -
 bears.

'The tiger's cage was also really small, but no tiger was 
present, maybe he was inside what looked like a nightmarish doghouse 
with tiny windows.

'All in all, a terrible experience.

'You don't get even close to a feeling of visiting nature, instead it looks like a tiny and filthy prison.

'This zoo is an utter disgrace. I do not get how it is still open.'

Trapped: Some of the animals, used to roaming free, like the monkeys (pictured), are kept in incredibly small cages so that visitors can be ensured a better look

Other animals from the zoo's collected 55 species are left to roam around the zoo's grounds

Another visitor said 'this is a terrible place for animals that live in small cages - they look shabby and depressed'.

And one reviewer just simply wrote: 'Ces't monstreux.' (It is monstrous)

Because of the terrible conditions, the zoo has suffered a bad reputation for animal mistreatment for years.

Many campaigns have been started against it, including that of local animal rights activists under the Marjan civic group, who have been trying for years to have the zoo closed.

Many animals are simply left to socialise in indiscriminate areas, mixing in bizarre combinations because the number of cages are not sufficient enough

The groups have been trying to get 
the zoo closed since 2006, to some success a few years later as the 
managers decided to stop accepting or bringing in new animals.

However, it wasn't until now that they decided to close it.

Marjan's leader, Srdjan Marinic, told Jutarnji List: 'Bears live in a small concrete enclosure.

'Until recently there were five
 wolves in a cage and they had so little room that they constantly 
attacked one another.'

Croatia: The zoo is located on top of a hill in the Croatia's second largest city, Split. It has been open since 1924, and people have been trying to get it closed since 2006 because of the animal's conditions

Reviews: One of the tourists claimed that while the zoo boasted excellent views of the surrounding city, it also said the animals would cause 'sights that would fill eyes full of tears'

Once closed, the zoo will be made into
 a recreational park, featuring a playground, botanic garden and an 
enclosure for domestic animals, according to the deputy mayor.

The city in the southern Adriatic attracts hundreds of tourists from all over the year, especially in the summer.

Its popularity comes from both its Roman-era heritage and proximity to the popular Croatian islands surrounding it.
