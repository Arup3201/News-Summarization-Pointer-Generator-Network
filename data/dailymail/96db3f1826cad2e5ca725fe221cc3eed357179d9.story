Photographer Michel Roggo travelled to Russia with one mission - to get up close and personal with wild brown bears.

And as these unique new pictures show, he succeed in his task, capturing stunning images of the animals as they fished for food.

Mr Roggo visited the country's Kamchatka region equipped with an underwater camera mounted on a nine metre pole to snap the photographs, which offer a fresh perspective on the bear's well-documented behaviour.

But despite wanting to get as close as possible to the grizzlies, he had to try and maintain a safe distance at all times.

He explained: 'So to achieve the close-up images, I mounted my camera, in its underwater housing, on the end of a nine metre pole. Even so, it was not long enough sometimes!

'When photographing bears, it is important to understand their behaviour. You must known when to keep your distance, and when it is safe to approach them.'

Close up: Michel Roggo had one mission when he travelled to Russia to photograph grizzly bears, to get as close to them as possible

Caught it: Mr Rogge's images show the bear fishing in the river trying to catch salmon and other fish to eat

Head shot: The photographer captured the images using a range of equipment including an underwater camera mounted on a nine meter long pole

Itchy: The brown bear scratches its ear before setting off under the water to hunt for its food

On the hunt: The bear scans the river bed by putting his head under water, looking for salmon and other fish to catch

Underwater: The bear comes to inspect the underwater camera equipment, allowing Mr Roggo to snap this close up of the creature

Eyeing up his prey: The bear spots a fish swimming past and gets ready to to snatch it with his large paws

Got it: Despite trying to swim away, the bear grasps the fish in his large hands ready to take it to the surface

Try again: The bear's paw goes back into the river as he tries to find some more fish to eat

Success: The bear captures yet another fish, this time a smaller one in the Ozernaya River in the Kamtchatka region of Russia

Watching for afar: Mr Roggo said that when photographing the bears, it was important for him to keep a safe distance from the animals, which can be dangerous
