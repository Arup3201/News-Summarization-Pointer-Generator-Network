A former soldier jailed for life for raping and killing a teenage Iraqi girl and shooting dead her family died in an Arizona prison over the weekend in a suspected suicide.

Steven Dale Green was the first American soldier convicted under the 2000 Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act - a law that gives the federal government power to pursue criminal cases against American citizens and soldiers for acts committed in foreign lands.

Prison officials said they found the 28-year-old from Midland, Texas, unconscious in his Tucson cell on Saturday and believe his death was a suicide. He is thought to have been found hanged.

Suicide: Steven Green is escorted to the courthouse during his 2009 trial. He was convicted of raping and killing an Iraqi girl and then shooting dead her family in 2006. He was found hanged on Saturday

Green was a private in the 101st Airborne Division based at Fort Campbell on the Kentucky-Tennessee state line when he deployed to Iraq.

He and three other soldiers went to the home of an Iraqi family in Mahmoudiya, Iraq, near a traffic checkpoint in March 2006.

At the home, Green shot and killed three members of the al-Janabi family before becoming the third soldier to rape 14-year-old Abeer Qassim al-Janabi before killing her. He was convicted and sentenced in 2009.

Three other soldiers, Jesse Spielman, Paul Cortez and James Barker, are serving lengthy sentences in the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas for their roles in the attack. Each is eligible for parole in 2015.

Green was discharged from the military in May 2006 after being found to have a personality disorder.

In multiple interviews from prison, Green frequently expressed regret at taking part in the attack and frustration that he was tried and convicted in the civilian system, which does not afford inmates parole, while the others involved went through the military justice system and have a chance to be released from prison.

'I was made to pay for all the war crimes. I'm the only one here in federal prison,' Green said in an October 2013 interview. 'I think they plan to throw away the key in my situation.'

The attack on the al-Janabi family happened at a particularly violent point in the U.S.-led Iraq war.

Location: Green was
stationed for several weeks at a traffic checkpoint near Mahmoudiya in 
an area known as the 'Triangle of Death'. The four soldiers 
went to the al-Janabi home about 20 miles south of Baghdad

Green and his fellow soldiers were stationed for several weeks at a traffic checkpoint near Mahmoudiya in an area known as the 'Triangle of Death' when, after an afternoon of card playing, sex talk and drinking Iraqi whiskey, the four soldiers went to the al-Janabi home about 20 miles south of Baghdad.

Green shot and killed the teenager's mother, father and sister, then followed Cortez and Barker in raping the girl before shooting her in the face.

Her body was set on fire. Spielman said he didn't know what the other soldiers had planned and merely stood watch near the front of the house.

Barker and Cortez pleaded guilty and acknowledged taking part in the rape.

Spielman went to trial and was convicted because prosecutors said he knew what was planned.

A fourth soldier, Bryan Howard, stayed behind at the checkpoint and later pleaded guilty to being an accessory. He served 27 months in Fort Leavenworth.

A federal jury in Paducah spared Green a death sentence in May 2009, but U.S. District Judge Thomas B. Russell ordered Green to serve multiple life sentences.

'I was punished out of proportion to everybody else,' Green said in October. 'I'm not a victim, but I haven't been treated fairly. Not even remotely close. That's all I ever asked for was to be treated the same. They just won't do it. I don't know why.'
