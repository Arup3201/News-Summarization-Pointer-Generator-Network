Fujiyama Crest, the legendary racehorse of Frankie Dettori, has died at the grand old age of 23.  

The stallion became part of racing history when he completed Dettori's 'magnificent seven' at Ascot in 1996 with a victory in the Gordon Carter H.    

Following that famous win, Fujiyama Crest became a hurdler for a while before returning to the flat. He was set to go through the sales ring in 2000, but Dettori purchased his winning horse and Fujiyama Crest lived out the rest of his life as the jockey's pet.

Dettori told thoroughbreddailynews.com, 'He died peacefully in his paddock. He's been at my home in Stetchworth ever since I bought him when he was up for sale 15 years ago and I'll never forget him.' 

The Italian added: 'He changed my life. There would have been no magnificent seven without him. He's been a real family pet out in the paddock at home and all my children have sat on him.'
