We all have our own ways of dealing with heartache, whether its drinking our cares away with friends, turning to the comfort of our families, or perhaps even buying a sports car.

But one pensioner took a slightly more unorthodox approach after splitting from his wife by nailing a caravan on top of a motorised catamaran and sailing it around the English coast.

The unusual vehicle, which also features a rather flimsy looking safety fence, was last spotted making its way along The Swale between the Isle of Sheppey and Kent coast. 

Unusual sight: The pensioner has now taken to the water in a floating caravan, seen in recent days chugging along down The Swale between the Isle of Sheppey and Kent coast

Puzzled locals, who have watched the bizarre contraption in disbelief, said the owner is a keen boatman in his '70s or 80s’ and lives in nearby Sittingbourne.

Some residents had theorized that the man built the craft to appease his wife, who was said to hate sailing but love caravaning.

However a close friend of the handyman said that the couple actually split two years ago, and his friend built the craft as a way of coping with his grief.

‘And fisherman Trevor Ryan, 63, added: ‘He bought the catamaran and then he fitted the caravan on it and launched it from Iron Wharf boatyard.

‘He is about 70 or 80 years old and he has got a few yachts and boats in the harbour but for some reason he has obviously built this caravan. I don't know why he has done it.

'But he loves the water and maybe he saw it as a bit of an escape where he could get away and watch the world go by.’

The Swale is a 13-mile channel that separates Sheppey from the north Kent mainland, and can be crossed by two bridges.
