Two ice fisherman were in for a big surprise when the reeled in a live bird from freezing waters  in northwestern Pennsylvania earlier this week.

In a video titled, 'Shocking ice fishing video from Pennsylvania!', Nicholas Colangelo filmed his friend Fred Christensen pulling a live red-breasted merganser out of a hole in a large sheet of ice in  Monday.

Red-breasted mergansers dive into the water while foraging for food and can usually stay under for a little under a minute - so the fisherman pulled up the line at the perfect moment.

Christensen, who was fishing for muskies with Colangelo and friend Luke Wholey, told Daily Mail Online that he realized immediately that he wasn't pulling up a fish, but he wasn't expecting a bird.

'I wasn't exactly certain what flashed passed the hole, there were colors that just didn't set well with me so I was hesitant of grabbing something I hadn't yet identified,' he wrote in an e-mail interview. '[It] Wasn't until I saw feathers that I realized what was going on.'

'My jaw hit the ice,' Colangelo told the Washington Post. 'I was absolutely shocked.'

Colangelo said that though he and his friends go fishing regularly and have seen mergansers dive under water for long stretches of time, he wasn't expecting to catch the bird on his fishing line.

'I've never heard of anything like this happening,' he told the Washington Post. 'It was so unusual.'

In the video, Christensen can be seen pulling up the fishing line out of a small hole in the water until he eventually reaches his hand in and pulls out a squirming live bird.

Unusual: Christensen was hesitant to reach into the water at first, but he grabbed the merganser and likely saved it from drowning on the end of the fishing line

After Christensen posed for a picture, the men untangled the bird and set it free into it's natural habitat. 

'It didn't take long to realize it wasn't happy, I just grabbed the mean end as soon as I saw the chance,' Christensen wrote in an e-mail.

'I figured controlling its head and body would make unhooking and tangling much faster, I treated it the same as I would a fish. Thankfully Nick was there to help, it would have been a difficult task to accomplish alone,' he added.

Colangelo told the Washington Post that the bird was only minimally tangled and easily made its way back to its flock.

Christensen said that he had never heard of people catching a merganser through the ice, but said that it occasionally happens 'in open water in ares where large amounts of water birds like to congregate'. 

The three fishermen don't kill anything that they catch while fishing and release it all back into the wild. 

'I would just sincerely like to say that the environment , the fish the birds - that's what's high priority,' Colangelo told the Washington Post.

Christensen said that there's 'no sense in killing' the fish they catch, and that you never know a fish's full potential if it's killed.

'I've seen and have caught fish I've released even years prior that have had identifying scars or characteristics that couldn't be mistaken,' he said. 

'When you experience catching a fish that you've caught before it is a good feeling to see that the fish is still alive and well. It gives you that much more incentive to let them all go,' he added.

The three men often fish for musky, a rare and large species that is known to be difficult to catch. 

The freshwater fish is often spotted around the Great Lakes region and through Canada. 

Colangelo and Wholey hit headlines last month after catching a 53-pound musky while ice fishing n northwest Pennsylvania, according to CBS. 

The men estimated that the fish was about 30 years old. They were one pound away from matching a 1949 state record for biggest musky catch.

Christensen that that three days prior to catching the merganser, he had another unusual bird encounter. 

'I watched a bald eagle wipe out a Canadian goose and carried it as far as it could until it realized it was extremely heavy,' he wrote. 'It just so happened it dropped less than ten yards from where I was quietly sitting waiting for a flag to pop.'

'Most would find this crazy uncommon, but for me it's just a typical day on water,' the fisherman said.
