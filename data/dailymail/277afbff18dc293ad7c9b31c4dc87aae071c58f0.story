Bayern Munich coach Pep Guardiola has admitted that he fears losing his job at the end of the coming season.

Speaking at a press conference prior to Bayern's pre-season tour of the USA, the Catalan said, 'there are no secrets. If I don't win, then a different coach will probably come in'.

The remark came in the context of concerns that the six members of Bayern's side who had just won the World Cup with Germany would suffer under lack of motivation upon returning to club football.

Both the media and Bayern's Director of Sport Matthias Sammer have voiced fears recently that Bayern would emulate their performances in 2006 and 2010, and start poorly after a World Cup summer.

'We can't allow ourselves a phase like that', said Sammer.

Guardiola, though, whose Champions League winning Barcelona team of 2011 also contained newly crowned World Cup winners, is adamant that Germany's triumph is a good thing for his side.

'I am happy for Germany that they won the World Cup. It is a great gift for FC Bayern that six of our players were able to contribute to it.'

Easy does it: Guardiola has been sporting a casual look as he guides Bayern through pre season

Nonetheless, further success is absolutely expected this season of Guardiola and his team.

The Catalan begins the second year of his three year contract this summer, and despite winning the Double and the Bundesliga in record time last season, Bayern's exit to Real Madrid in the Champions League was enough to keep the jury out on their new coach.

European success is the reference point for judging Guardiola's success at Bayern. After taking over a treble winning team, and leading them to a record Double, anything short of the European Cup title this year will be considered a failure for Guardiola.

Concern: The former Barca boss is under pressure to succeed after his Champions League disappointment

The Munich press are already ramping up the pressure, with tabloid TZ publishing a survey which showed Bayern as clear Champions League favourites for next season.

Guardiola knows himself that failure to win the tournament again may put his job at risk. He remains determined to avoid such a fate, and cool in the face of the pressure.

'I am here to do my job to the best of my abilities, just as I used to at FC Barcelona' he told the press.
