Billionaire talk show host Oprah Winfrey is auctioning off hundreds of possessions from four of her lavishly-decorated mansions.

The sale will take place at the Santa Barbara Polo Club in California on November 2, close to where one of the 59-year-old's sprawling estates is located.

Richard Mineards, a newspaper columnist in the local area, told Page Six that it will be 'a major feeding frenzy . . . like the Jackie O Sotheby’s auction' of 1996, which made over $34million.

According to The Hollywood Reporter among the items up for auction are the iron panels that adorned the main staircase at Ms Winfrey's $85 million estate in Santa Barbara - carrying a pre-sale estimate of $4,000 to $7,000.

And her much-photographed green and white plaid couch, with down-stuffed cushions and coordinating pillows, is expected to fetch between $3,000 and $4,000.

There are also a number of prized European antiques that Ms Winfrey has decided to part with.

One 'exquisite' marble-topped Louis XVI chest of drawers is expected to make up to $50,000.

While a set of Louis XV armchairs upholstered in hand-embroidered yellow silk, have been valued at $20,000 to $40,000.

It is thought that Ms Winfrey was inspired to get rid of her belongings in preparation for her 60th birthday bash next January, which she is set to host at her main residence in Santa Barbra.

Us Weekly reports that Beyonce and 
Tina Turner may perform, and the guest list could include Julia Roberts,
John Travolta and Tom Cruise.

After clearing out the property, Ms Winfrey went about decluttering her other abodes.

Earlier this year, she disclosed in O Magazine, 'I am evolving [and] my taste is too'.

She went on to say that ‘the gilded mirrors, marble urns, the lavish carpets and sherbet palette – it was all very grand, but it wasn’t very true to myself,' concluding, ‘the thing that had been missing from all the beautiful places I’d ever lived in, was me!'

According to journalist Mr Mineard, all of her unwanted belongings are currently being stored in a 50,000-square-foot warehouse.

Beverly Hills-based Kaminski Auctions has been hired to sell them off on her behalf.

The auction will include items from Ms Wonfrey’s homes in Chicago, Maui and Indiana as well as Santa Barbara.

Proceeds will benefit The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy Foundation College Fund, dedicated to helping graduates of The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls - South Africa attend colleges and universities around the world.
