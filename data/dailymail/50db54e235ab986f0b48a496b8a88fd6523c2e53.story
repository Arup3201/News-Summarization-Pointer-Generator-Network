Elizabeth Vargas' husband has denied having an affair with a spinning instructor while his wife was in rehab for alcoholism.

Marc Cohn, a Grammy Award-winning songwriter, and the 20/20 anchor has been married since 2002 but it was reported that he may have had an affair with another woman- the couple's mutual friend Ruth Zuckerman- after he was spotted having dinner with her shortly after Vargas returned to Manhattan from rehab.

'I have no comment regarding vicious rumors about a so-called “affair,”' he told MailOnline through a spokesperson.

Together: Elizabeth Vargas and her husband Marc Cohn (seen here in 2012) have been married since 2002 and he denied allegedly having an affair while she was in rehab for alcohol addiction

Friend or foe: The affair was reported when a friend spotted Cohn having dinner with he and Elizabeths' mutual friend Ruth Zuckerman, one of the founders of Flywheel Sports spin studios

'I have encouraged and supported Elizabeth's recovery as her years of struggle have been hard on everyone. Out of deference to my family's privacy, I will not comment further.'

Sources have confirmed to MailOnline that Vargas and Cohn are still living together and have not separated, but his side suggested that it is because he wants to remain as 'a stabilizing force for both Elizabeth and the children'.

Adding to the love triangle is the fact that both Vargas and Cohn were friends with Zuckerman, the divorced head of Flywheel Sports, ahead of the alleged affair. They met her by taking spinning classes at her workout chain. 

Unidentified sources told MailOnline that in spite of the allegations, Cohn and Vargas are still living together and have not separated.

Opening up: Vargas spoke on The View in February about her recovery and how her husband was the one to alert her to a dependency problem

The source also said that they never separated and were still a couple both during and after Vargas' treatment in spite of the reports that a friend spotted Cohn having dinner with Zuckerman near the Flywheel outpost in Manhattan's Flatiron district at some point after her treatment ended.

Vargas left the treatment program in mid-November and then gave several interviews when she returned to work in January.

A different friend told The New York Post said that Cohn and Zuckerman had been more than friends for more than just one meal.

'It was disgusting that he was with Ruth while Elizabeth was in rehab,' the source told The Post.

Legal definitions: Friends of Cohn, known best for his hit 'Walking in Memphis', said that he has not moved out or ended his relationship with Vargas. Zuckerman, right, is divorced

Friends of the 'Walking in Memphis' singer denied that anything untoward happened in the first place and said that Cohn and Vargas had separated but MailOnline's sources denied that any a split had ever happened. 

Cohn, 54, and Vargas, 51, were introduced by Andre Agassi at the U.S. Open in 1999.

They dated for three years before getting married in 2002 and Vargas gave birth to their first son Zachary six months later. Their second son Sam was born in 2006.

During her post-treatment interviews, Vargas said that her husband was the one who encouraged her to get help for her alcohol dependency.

'Mark has been extremely supportive of Elizabeth over the years and its been a long haul,' a friend close to the family told MailOnline.
