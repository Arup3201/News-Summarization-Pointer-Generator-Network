Villagers have branded two council Christmas trees the worst in Britain - 'and possibly the world'.

The threadbare living firs prompted derision when they were planted in patches of grass in the Greater Manchester villages of Mottram and Micklehurst.

Locals in Mottram even set up a Facebook campaign called 'Embarrassment of Mottram Christmas Tree!' and adorned it with tinsel and baubles themselves.

Humbug! The council Christmas tree in Micklehurst, Greater Manchester, has just a solitary string of fairy lights (left) - while in Mottram, locals have bought their own baubles and tinsel to make it less dismal (right)

Resident Ian Gauld said of the tree in Micklehurst (above): 'It's got to be the worst anywhere in the UK. It's absolutely rubbish. It's just a waste of time. Unless someone points it out you don't even notice it'

One poster on the group suggested Mottram had the 'Worst Xmas tree in the UK / possibly the world'.

Five miles away in Micklehurst, that village's tree still has the only decoration sanctioned by cash-strapped officials - a solitary string of fairy lights.

Tameside Council, which has had to cut £142million from its budgets over five years, insisted the trees were a low-cost way of celebrating the festive season.

The firs will not be ripped from the ground in January and will instead be left to grow, providing the villages with a larger tree each year.

But that excuse did not prevent a backlash.

Mottram hairdresser Louise Downing said: 'I thought the tree was a quite appalling. It's normally about 7ft - this one just looks like the top of last year's tree.

'We normally have a lot of flowers in the summer but there hasn't been this year. I do think it's nice that people have tried to sort it out a little bit, it's gone some way making up for the state the tree was in.'

Cleaner Jessie Rebbitt, 33, added: 'We have a lot of pride in the area so to get something like this is appalling. How's that for a merry Christmas?

'The way things are at the moment people need something to look forward to and that's nothing to smile about. That's not going to bring people closer together in a good way. It's just going to bring people closer to complain.'

In Micklehurst locals are hoping for some homespun decorations in their village, too.

Ian Gauld, 57, said: 'At the moment the tree's pathetic and got to be the worst anywhere in the UK. 

'It's absolutely rubbish. It's just a waste of time. Unless someone points it out you don't even notice it. It's hiding behind the lamp post.'

Student Alex Bradley, 19, added: 'It's that small I thought somebody would nick it, but it's not even worth nicking. It's like a twig.'

Not everyone was a fan of the community spirit in Mottram, however.

Linda DeCarle, 68, said: 'They should have left it alone. They have made it worse. If you can't do it properly don't do it.' 

A spokesman for Labour-run Tameside Council said the trees were 'sustainable' and 'designed to provide a tree for many years to come'.

Parish council minutes suggested the living trees cost around £1,600 each - compared to £2,000 each for temporary trees, a sum which would have to be paid again in full the next year.

'As is widely accepted local authorities up and down the country are facing huge cuts to their budgets so are continually under pressure to find more innovative ways of working,' the spokesman added.

'By providing living trees as a one-off cost the trees can be re-used year-on-year without the additional costs attached to erecting and taking down a new tree every Christmas.

Homespun: Locals decorated the Mottram tree with their own baubles - but one said it looked even worse

'Because they are recently planted they are small, but will obviously grow into Christmas trees the whole community can enjoy.

'As an aside community-minded locals have already started dressing the tree in Mottram, which is bringing the community together at such a special time of year.' 

Micklehurst resident Irene Platt, 65, had little time for the excuse.

'The council should have planted that one and put another one up for this year,' she said. 'I haven't seen it lit but I doubt it will make much difference.' 

Tameside Council was unable to confirm whether it or parish councils paid for the trees.
