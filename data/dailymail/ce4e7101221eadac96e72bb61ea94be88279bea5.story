Iconic: Pope Francis graced the cover of Rolling Stone in February showing just how famous throughout the world he has become

It comes as the 77-year-old Pontiff is accused of killing defenceless doves by releasing them from a Vatican window - with animal activists claiming they 
inevitably get preyed upon by wild birds.

Earlier
 today, the Italian RSPCA equivalent was revealed to have declared in an
 open letter that because doves are bred in captivity, the Pope's act of
 releasing them is 'condemning them to certain death'.

The
 group appealed to Pope Francis to end the practice of releasing doves 
from the window overlooking St Peter's Square, a day after a pair
 of the peace symbols were attacked by a seagull and crow while a crowd 
including thousands of children watched below.

In contrast, Rolling Stone's cover article highlights the Pope's success at 'establishing himself as a people's Pope'.

It comments on his 'noticeable break 
from Vatican tradition', which has seen him 'present a more 
all-inclusive attitude toward human rights'.

The cover photo itself was taken by the magazine's contributing editor Mark Binelli, who visited the Vatican in person, according to Rolling Stone.

During
 his visit, Mr Binelli witnessed the Pope display his 'all-inclusive' attitude by 
telling a congregation weathering a storm in the piazza that he
 wished he could be with them.

'He seemed to really mean it,' Mr Binelli told the magazine.

Yesterday, the National Animal Protection Agency 
published an open letter reminding Pope Francis that domesticated 
doves are easy prey for predators like gulls.

‘Do
 not use animals and their lives anymore, for these already outdated 
traditions,’ the animal protection agency, known as ENPA, said, adding 
that freeing doves in Rome is like ‘condemning them to certain death.’

‘Animals
 born in captivity, not being wild animals, aren't able to recognize 
predators as such and are thus incapable of fleeing from possible 
dangerous situations,’ ENPA said, adding it was launching a signature 
petition to garner the pope's attention.

The two larger birds swooped on the 
defenceless doves during the Pope’s weekly Sunday Angelus prayer in 
front of tens of thousands of worshippers gathered in the Vatican. 

After
 saying a prayer for Ukraine, where at least three people were killed 
during the latest clashes that have seen Kiev in flames, the Pontiff 
helped schoolchildren release the doves from the window of the Apostolic
 Palace as a peace gesture. 

Crow fought the wings of a dove: While speaking at the window beforehand, Francis had appealed for peace in Ukraine, where anti-government protesters have died

But they were immediately attacked. The seagull pinned one 
of the doves against the wall of the palace and pecked at its tail, but 
was left with a mouthful of feathers as its victim made an escape.

The
 crow caught the smaller bird unawares, as it rested on a windowsill, 
before pecking at it repeatedly.  Again, the victim managed to get away.

Eventually both doves flew off, seemingly uninjured, to the relief of tens of thousands of onlookers.

The release of the birds concludes the Vatican’s annual  Caravan of Peace event.

Last year one of the doves was set upon by a gull, while in 2012 they simply flew back into the Apostolic Apartments.

While speaking at the window 
beforehand, Francis had appealed for peace in Ukraine, after at least 
three people were killed during the latest clashes in the two-month 
crisis.
