A Montana homeowner was sentenced Thursday to 70 years in prison, with no parole for at least 20 years, in the shotgun killing of a German exchange student who was trespassing in his garage.

District Judge Ed McLean said Markus Kaarma was hunting, not safeguarding his home when he shot 17-year-old Diren Dede early one April morning.

'Here you have a 12-gauge shotgun, not to protect your family but to go after someone,' the judge told Kaarma. 'And go after someone you did.'

Convicted: Markus Kaarma stands in Missoula County District Court while Judge Ed McLean sentences him to 70 years in prison for the shooting death of German exchange student Diren Dede on Thursday

Victim: Markus Kaarma shot Diren Dede (seen left and right), who was unarmed, after being alerted by motion sensors in his garage. Witnesses said Kaarma fired at the teen four times, striking him twice

A Missoula jury convicted Kaarma, 30, of deliberate homicide in the case that caused an outcry in Germany and brought scrutiny to Montana's law allowing the use of deadly force in some situations to protect home and family. Kaarma faced between 10 to 100 years in prison.

He shot Dede, who was unarmed, after being alerted by motion sensors in his garage. Witnesses said Kaarma fired at the teen four times, striking him twice.

McLean was quoted by the Missoulian as also saying in court Thursday to Kaarma 'You pose too great a risk to society to be anywhere else but the Montana State Prison. Good luck to you, son.' 

Dede's father, Celal Dede, said of the sentence: 'It is justice. I am not happy. My son is dead.'

He and his wife attended the entire trial, and he flew back from Germany for Thursday's hearing.

Kaarma sat staring down during much of the proceeding, occasionally glancing around the crowded courtroom. He sported buzz-cut, dark hair and an orange jail suit.

'I'm sorry my actions caused the death of Mr. Dede,' Kaarma told the judge.

Before handing down the sentence, McLean heard testimony from Kaarma's girlfriend, a detective, the teen's host parents in Missoula and others.

According to the Missoulian, host father Randy Smith testified 'Diren's murder has turned [our lives] into a whirlwind of shock, grief and sadness.

'It's one of those things that you see on the TV news, not here, not to us. It's literally sucked all the joy out of our family. Every day is a grind now. We just do what we have to do to get through the day.

Kaarma's mother, Chong Kaarma, pleaded for leniency for the sake of her grandson, asking the judge to let the boy have his father as soon as possible.

She apologized to Celal Dede from the stand. He replied from his front-row seat: 'Why did you wait? Too late.'

Kaarma's girlfriend, Janelle Pflager, testified she has received death threats against her 19-month-old son with and Kaarma. She called Kaarma the 'single-most misunderstood person I have ever met.'

'He didn't want to kill anyone,' she said. 'He only wanted to make sure he and myself and son were alive at the end.'

Missoula County Attorney Karla Painter later asked Pflager if she said during a phone call with Kaarma in jail that she and Kaarma wouldn't pay for the Dedes' 'dirty rat son' to be sent back to Germany for burial.

Pflager said she didn't recall saying that.

Family: Celal Dede, right, father of slain German student Diren Dede speaks while his attorney Bernard Docke listens in Missoula on Thursday. Dede said of Kaarma's sentence 'It is justice. I am not happy. My son is dead'

Student: Diren Dede, from Hamburg, Germany, was studying at Missoula's Big Sky High School and planned to leave the U.S. after the school term ended a few weeks after the shooting

Prosecutors argued Kaarma was intent on luring an intruder into his garage after it was burglarized at least once in the weeks before the shooting. Three witnesses testified they heard Kaarma say he'd been waiting up nights to shoot an intruder.

On the night of the shooting, authorities said, Kaarma left his garage door partially open. He fired four shotgun blasts, pausing between the third and fourth shots, witnesses said.

Lead detective Guy Baker testified that the first three shots were low and seemed to follow Dede as he moved across the garage. But the fourth shot was aimed higher and struck Dede in the head, Baker said.

The Missoulian reported that Dr. Douglas Johnson said Kaarma has mental health issues, including anxiety, and that he stated 'I am confident that Markus Kaarma was remorseful. He has strong feelings, but has difficulty expressing that.'

However, the newspaper quoted McLean as saying to Kaarma '[Your anxiety] doesn't excuse the anguish you have caused. Anxiety isn't an excuse.'

Kaarma's lawyers argued the Missoula man feared for his life, didn't know if the intruder was armed, and was on edge because of a previous burglary.

Montana is among more than 30 states with expanded rights for residents to use deadly force to protect their homes or themselves, sometimes known as 'stand your ground' laws.

Kaarma said in court in December that he never intended to hurt anyone that night. His attorneys have said they will appeal to Montana's Supreme Court.

'I did what I thought was necessary to protect my family,' he said, according to KPAX. 

Dede, from Hamburg, Germany, was studying at Missoula's Big Sky High School and planned to leave the U.S. after the school term ended a few weeks after the shooting.

His parents testified earlier that they were unable to work or plan for the future after their son's death.

Also Thursday, McLean rejected a request for a new trial from Kaarma's attorneys. They argued extensive news coverage of the shooting prevented the seating of an impartial jury.

The case prompted one Missoula lawmaker to draft legislation that would require violent entry into an occupied structure for the use of force to be justified.

Defense lawyers said they planned to appeal the verdict to the Montana Supreme Court, but otherwise made no comment.
