A 19-year-old student missing since yesterday morning was last seen driving home drunk before stopping on the side of the road for a flat tire.

Howard’s family says when she left her Slidell home Friday morning, the Dean’s List student, who was recently accepted into pharmacy school, was headed to classes at UNO and then to work Uptown.

'She was supposed to come to Slidell after she got off of work and meet up with us, but she ended up going with some co-workers and here we are,' said friend Daniel Lemonier.

Howard was last seen at a dorm on campus dropping off a friend following drinks at a Magazine Street bar.
