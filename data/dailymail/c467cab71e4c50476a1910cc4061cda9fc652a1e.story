From incredible devices designed to make humans stronger to clever gadgets that can cut noise pollution and waste from manufacturing processes, engineers have created amazing products designed to make our lives easier.

They are fighting it out to win the James Dyson Award, which recognises ideas large and small that have the potential to solve significant problems.

A total of 20 ideas have been shortlisted and they range from tackling large problems like renewable energy by generating power from waves, to ripening fruit and vegetables at the best time.

A group of U.S. engineers have invented the 'Titan arm' to protect warehouse workers who frequenly lift heavy loads from the risk of arm and back injuries. Their robitic arm is an upper-body exoskeleton that augments human strength and braces the back to prevent poor lifting technique

Handie is an affordable prosthetic hand with inbuilt sensors that can read brain signals. All its parts are easily modified and made using a 3D printer

The winner will be announced on November 7 and will win £30,000.

The engineer will follow in the footsteps of Dan Watson, who won the award last year for his SafetyNet device, which encourages sustainable fishing.

A total of 650 projects were entered by creative scientists from 18 countries.

'Bold ideas big and small can solve significant problems. The entries into this year's award, from young engineers and scientists around the world all show promise, but are only at the start of the long process towards commercialisation,' Sir James Dyson said.

A handful of the engineers set out to solve health-related problems. Karl Price and his team from the University of Waterloo, Canada, have invented a robotic surgery tool to replace manual suturing, saving valuable time in the operating room.

AWARING is a device that indicates a speaker's location using a light and volume. It could help people with hearing impairments who find it difficult to lip read and follow conversation in group situations

Sono is a device that can be fitted onto a window to eliminate and cancel sound coming from outside

A group of U.S. engineers have invented the 'Titan arm' to protect warehouse workers who frequently lift heavy loads from the risk of arm and back injuries.

Their robotic arm is an upper-body exoskeleton that augments human strength and braces the back to prevent poor lifting technique.

The team said the arm could also be used to help stroke and injury victims rebuild muscle and re-learn fine motor control.

Sam Etherington designed a device called renewable wave power (pictured) that absorbs forces from the troughs and peaks of waves from any direction in a bid to make cleaner energy

A suitcase made from BioWool is pictured. It is made from waste material from the coarse wool industry

Hiroshi Yamaura innovated Handie- an affordable dexterous prosthetic hand with inbuilt sensors that can read brain signals, while another Japanese designer has created AWARING - a device that indicates a speaker's location to help those with hearing impairments lip read in a large group situation, where they can easily get left behind.

Jake Evill's distinctive looking 3D-printed Cortex cast could keep arms rigid to help them heal after a fracture and is created from waste plastic.

Other designers also focused on the challenge of reducing wastage and recycling materials.

British engineer Dan McLoughlin 
observed that the coarse wool industry creates a lot of waste product 
that goes to landfill and found that he could use this material to make a
 biodegradeable, flame resistant plastic, which he called BioWool.

The
 material is made by carding the wool and then uses needles to shred and
 pull the fibres together to produce a material similar in feel to 
plastic or softer like a felt.

Xarius is a portable energy generator that allows the charging of electrical appliances using wind power - making it suitable to charge a phone in areas with limited access to mains electricity

Fruit and veg is best stored and ripened in specific conditions so OLTU uses excess heat produced behind the fridge to power a separate unit that has sections designed to keep different fruit in different conditions to it ripens properly

Minimally invasive surgery leads to small incisions that can be difficult to suture- or seal. The Automated Suturing Tool could eliminate the need for manual suturnig to save time in the operating room

Another British engineer, Sam Etherington, designed a device called renewable wave power that  absorbs forces from the troughs and peaks of waves from any direction in a bid to make cleaner energy. 

While Britain has 11,073km of 
coastline and the potential to produce 40-70KWh per metre, the country 
currently harnesses just 1 per cent of the free resource. But Mr 
Etherington hopes his invention could change that.

Other scientists came up with innovative gadgets to transform everyday tasks.

Diabetics use a device that breaks the skin to measure their blood sugar levels but Gluco could change that. It uses a person's smartphone linked to a watch to measure the levels, eliminating the need to break the skin. An insulin pen takes the results from the watch and prepares the appropriate dosage

Cortex is a 3D printed system for fracture support that is lightweight, waterproof and ventilated. It could make itchy, cumbersome plaster casts a thing of the past

Mugi Yamamoto created Stack - a compact inkjet printer that can be place on top of a pile of paper that moves downwards to swallow the paper until none is left, creating in turn, another stack of finished papers.

Kent Frankovich came up with 
Revolights, which are a series of LED rings that are clipped onto a 
bike's existing rims, powered by battery packs, while a fork-mounted 
magnet works with an integrated accelerometer to work out when the 
lights should be lit.

The 
front half of the front rim shines bright white, while the back half of 
the rear rim glows red, much like car lights, to help cyclists be more 
easily seen by drivers on the road.

Revolights use are a series of LED rings that are clipped onto a bike's existing rims, powered by battery packs, while a fork-mounted magnet works with an integrated accelerometer to work out when the lights should be lit. They could make cyclists more visible on roads, preventing accidents

Stack is a compact inkjet printer that is placed on top of a paper pile. When printing, it slowly moves downwards and swallows the pile until no paper is left, creating a new pile of printed papers

With an ever increasing population, living spaces are becoming smaller and noisier as sounds from the street encroach on everyday life.

This problem inspired Rudolf Stefanich to create Sono - a device that can be fitted to a window that stops certain annoying noises from passing through the glass into a home.

It might look like the Batmobile but Comb is an autonomous dumper truck that uses GPS to perform tasks remotely

In high contact sport concussion is common but it is often hard to know if a person needs medical attention. The Mamori gum shield has sensors to measure any impact on a sportsman and transmits the data to medical staff at the side of a pitch
