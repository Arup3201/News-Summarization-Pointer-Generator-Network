A jilted husband whose wife left him for disgraced banker Dominique Strauss-Kahn is considering legal action.

Music producer Johnny Cloutier, 48, is calling in lawyers after claiming he  is being denied access to the marital home and his two sons, aged 13 and three.

Strauss-Kahn’s affair with blonde TV executive Myriam L’Aouffir, 45, became public in May when they arrived at the Cannes Film Festival together.

Public affair: The affair between disgraced former IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn with TV executive Myriam L'Aouffir became public knowledge when they arrived at Cannes Film Festival together

The 64-year-old former International Monetary Fund chief has never been far from the headlines in recent years – including charges of attempted rape and accusations that he was a pimp organising orgies – but now Ms L’Aouffir’s personal life is in the spotlight.

A friend of Mr Cloutier said he was ‘absolutely furious’ about the affair.

‘His sons knew nothing about their mother carrying on with Strauss-Kahn until they saw them on the red carpet together at the Cannes Film Festival.

'Since then, Myriam and Strauss-Kahn have been popping up at any glamorous event you can think of,’ said the friend.

‘Johnny is livid about this – as far as he is concerned, someone who was accused of rape is sleeping with his wife in their marital bed.

‘The situation is intolerable.’

The former IMF chief had been 
expected by many to become France's Socialist presidential candidate 
before his professional career came to a screeching halt with his May 
2011 arrest.

His 
accuser, Nafissatou Diallo, a housekeeper from Guinea in her early 
thirties, told police in 2011 that Strauss-Kahn had forced her to 
perform oral sex and tried to rape her after she arrived to clean his 
suite, causing her to tear a ligament in her shoulder.

Strauss-Kahn,
who has since separated from his wife, said in a 2011 interview on 
prime-time television in France that what happened was ‘a moral 
failing,’ but was a consensual sexual act.

The
accusations against him led to his arrest in New York, forced him to 
step down from his IMF post and quickly ended his potential candidacy 
for the French presidency.

His sexual assault case was dismissed by a New York judge in August 2011.

In
March 2012 additional charges surfaced that Strauss-Kahn and several 
other influential Frenchmen held organized sex parties around the world,
using the Carlton Hotel in Lille, France, as their base of operations.

French
prosecutors are now seeking to drop all charges against Strauss-Kahn 
related to ‘aggravated pimping’ in the Lille Carlton.
