It has long been a staple of Christmas day - the dramatic soap opera episode.

But this year, EastEnders lost its traditional place in topping the Christmas Day viewing, with bawdy sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys becoming this year's most-watched programme.

Mrs Brown's Boys - the bawdy show 
created by Irish comic Brendan O'Carroll, which has become a surprise 
ratings hit - pulled in an average audience of 9.4 million.

While ratings soared for the comedy, BBC 1's serial Eastenders suffered a slump in viewing figures.

All eyes on them: The comic family sitcom pulled in an average audience of 9.4 million

Instead of audiences staring at the 
television to see whether villainous Janine Butcher got her comeuppance,
 more were interested in giggling at the family sitcom.

It
 was also beaten by arch-rival Coronation Street with the ITV show 
taking the honours as the top festive soap opera for the first time in 
more than a decade.

Corrie tied with Doctor Who - which 
included Matt Smith's regeneration into the new doctor Peter Capaldi - 
on 8.3 million viewers, to jointly claim second spot in the viewing 
league table.

The 
Dr Who special, which saw The Doctor age 300 years and included a brief 
return for Karen Gillan as Amy Pond, was up 700,000 viewers on last 
year.

EastEnders was packed with darama, including the arrest of Janine Butcher for murder and the arrival of the new Queen Vic landlord played by Danny Dyer

All ITV figures in the overnight ratings include viewers on the catch-up plus one service.

This year's figures will be seen as a setback for EastEnders, which used to regularly top the Christmas viewing figures.

This year's episode was packed with incident, including the arrest of 
Janine Butcher for murder and the arrival of new Queen Vic landlord Mick
 Carter - played by Danny Dyer.

The show lost 1.6 million viewers compared with last year.

The
 BBC took six of the top ten places, but the Queen's Christmas broadcast
 missed out at the top end of the list.

BBC1's audience for the annual 
address traditionally figures in the top ten but this year's 5.7 million
 meant it failed to figure in the top shows.

However, with the 2.1 million who watched on ITV, the broadcast managed a combined 7.8 million.

The BBC News lost its place in this year's top ten, replaced by the ITV News.

BBC1
 controller Charlotte Moore said: 'Mrs Brown's Boys took the top spot 
with 9.4 million viewers, and the arrival of Peter Capaldi created the 
biggest peak audience at 10.2 million in Doctor Who.'
