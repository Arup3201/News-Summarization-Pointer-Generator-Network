Rio Ferdinand believes Wayne Rooney is the natural successor to Steven Gerrard as England captain — but feels Joe Hart could be a rival.

Rooney is vying to be skipper for club and country, although Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is seemingly unsure about handing the responsibility to the striker.

But Ferdinand labelled his former England and United team-mate ‘the most influential player England have got’ and insisted he has the maturity to replace Gerrard, with manager Roy Hodgson understood to be of the same opinion.

QPR defender Ferdinand said: ‘The natural progression would be Wayne getting it now.

'With other countries it’s usually the guy with the most caps, or who is most influential, and I think Wayne is the most influential player England have right now. Joe Hart is another candidate.’

Ferdinand, who captained England seven times, added: ‘I think Wayne has grown and he is growing into that role. He’s experienced, has played at the top level, has won a lot of things and he knows the game.’

Hopeful: Rooney is also aiming to become the new captain of Manchester United under Louis van Gaal

Candidate: England keeper Joe Hart could also be the next skipper
