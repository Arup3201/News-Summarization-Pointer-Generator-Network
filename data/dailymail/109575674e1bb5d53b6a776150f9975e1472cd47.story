Baby wipes are as safe and effective as cotton wool and water and can even soothe nappy rash, according to scientists.

A wipe is as gentle on baby skin as the cotton wool and water washing technique recommended by Government health experts, it is claimed.

Researchers at Manchester University tested the wipe against cotton wool and water on 280 babies over a three-year period.

They discovered that wipes are ‘as effective and as safe as water - but much more convenient for parents'.

And babies cleaned with wipes suffer less nappy rash.

The findings run contrary to guidelines 
from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice), which 
recommends that parents wash newborns with cotton wool and water 
to avoid skin irritation.

Babies under the age one lose more moisture through their skin than older children and are more vulnerable to irritation, meaning parents have to use gentler washing techniques.

Lead researcher Tina Lavender said 'the wipes were ‘equivalent to water and cotton wool in terms of skin hydration'.

They also revealed slightly lower levels of maternal-reported napkin dermatitis - or nappy rash - among babies washed with wipes than those who had water and cotton wool used on them.

Professor Lavender said: 'Our trial provides us with 
the strongest evidence available so far that we shouldn’t base our 
practice on tradition alone and that Nice needs to look at its current 
guidelines.

'For the first 
time, we now have a robust, adequately-powered study that can be used in
practice, the results of which should be adopted by our national 
guidelines.

'These results should provide 
healthcare professionals with much needed evidence-based information, 
giving them the option to support the skin-care cleansing regime best 
suited to individual parents and their newborn babies.'

The experiment was sponsored 
by wipe manufacturer Johnson & Johnson using their Extra Sensitive 
Wipes.

But Professor Lavender said the research was carried out under ‘strict, independent scientific 
protocols’, using blind tests and peer reviews.

She added: 'Our research, looking at one high street baby wipe, wanted to test whether the product was as safe and effective on newborn babies’ skins as water alone to see if midwives could help give parents more options than current guidelines provide.

'Parents can now be confident that using this specific baby wipe, proven in the largest randomised clinical trial conducted in newborn cleansing, is equivalent to water alone.'

The research was published in the journal BMC Paediatrics.
