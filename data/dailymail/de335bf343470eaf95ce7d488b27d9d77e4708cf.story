Margaret Rowe, 65, claims she lost her £184,000 a year job and objected to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife in a 'chauvinistic culture'

A city lawyer who was sacked after she voiced objections to a boss circulating a nude portrait of his wife around the office was described by her manager as having 'the maturity of an eight year old.'

Margaret Rowe, 65, of North London, claims she lost her £184,000 a year job at 'chauvinistic' Fidelity Worldwide Investment because she refused to act like a woman who 'knows her place'.

But Philip Warland, head of public policy and Miss Rowe's manager, said she constantly made aggressive and false accusations that she was being treated differently because she was a woman.

He said her comments were made with 'startling vehemence and ferocity' and had a 'machine gun delivery.' He recalled he was physically sick after one 'abusive' encounter.

Miss Rowe had objected when Fidelity's head of portfolio management James Bateman showed junior women colleagues photographs of the full-frontal painting of his wife, Cambridge don Dr Victoria Bateman.

She said many women in the office found the picture awkward. She also claimed she was constantly seen as aggressive because she was assertive and forthright in a man's culture. 

The Central London tribunal previously heard she had claimed victimisation when she was overlooked for promotion at the firm. 

But she was sacked after an independent investigation found no evidence of sex discrimination or bullying.

Ms Rowe is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination against Fidelity. She said after she was dismissed it was the end of her career because at 65 she had been planning to work until she was 70.

She joined the firm in 2007 and took a post as Director of Public Policy under Mr Warland in 2013.

He told the tribunal that claims he treated her differently because she was a woman were 'without foundation.' 

'I have been a manager in the City for 50 years and one of my leitmotifs has been to value people for themselves,' he said. 

'Partly this is based on Christian principle.'

Mr Warland, who was a trustee of the charity Oasis which rescues women from prostitution and trafficking, said he had become frustrated with Miss Rowe's constant attempts to undermine him. 

Philip Warland claims Miss Rowe was aggressive in her dealings with him and spoke with ferocity 

He admitted describing her as having 'the maturity of an eight-year-old' in an email to  his boss, Peter Yandle after another frustrated interaction.

He said he tried hard to include Miss Rowe in discussions and meetings, only excluding her from those she was not qualified to attend, but her unwillingness to compromise made her hard to work with.

'It felt like she was jumping from the fact she was not happy with the way she was being treated to allege the treatment was based on her being a woman,' he added. 

'That was completely groundless.'

In March 2014 Miss Rowe challenged him after the job of Director of Public Policy was given to a man.

She had told his boss, Mr Yandle, that the decision 'makes clear I am a lackey', so Mr Warland claims he tried to speak to her and explain her sex was not a factor in the decision.

Mr Warland said: 'What was frightening was not the content of what she said but the startling vehemence and ferocity and the machine gun delivery of the personalised invective. 

'I found it offensive and abusive and was physically sick when I left the office.

'In my 47 years working in the City I have never encountered this sort of abusive behaviour.'

By May Mr Warland said it became increasingly difficult for him to work with Ms Rowe. 

He added: 'By the time it came to the investigation, I would have found it difficult to get over the aggressiveness with which she treated me on March 31 and I would not want to work in an environment where there was a risk I might be subjected to that again.' 

The asset management firm says there was nothing prurient about the portrait of the Gonville and Caius College economist, Dr Victoria Bateman (left) by Anthony Connolly which was featured in an exhibition

He said he believed that by December 2013 Miss Rowe had decided she would undermine his authority in any way possible. 

He added: 'I treated Margaret fairly thoroughout investing a considerable amount of time trying to manage her and work though our issues and her gender never had any part to play in any of my dealings with her and others.'

Miss Rowe previously told the tribunal the culture of the asset management firm was chauvinistic. 

James Bateman is said to have shown junior women colleagues photographs of thepainting of his wife

Other members of staff had told the court they felt her emails were aggressive and she would often overstep the mark from professional interaction to personal attack.

The tribunal previously heard that the firm denied there was anything prurient about the portrait of the Gonville and Caius College economist, which was featured in an exhibition. 

Fidelity insisted the almost life-size painting – which received publicity when it was shown at London's Mall Galleries last year – was meant as a 'challenge against the objectification of women'.

Miss Rowe joined Fidelity in 2007 as head of the investments legal team and within four years was earning £135,000 a year and picking up annual bonuses of £49,000. 

Speaking of her dismissal she previously said: 'It hurt me very deeply I was dismissed when I had gone out of my way to treat people with respect and dignity.'

Some bosses accused her of playing the 'woman card' when she did not like a decision that had been made.  

The tribunal continues.
