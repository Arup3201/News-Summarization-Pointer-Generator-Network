Young sufferer: Nikki Cooper, 32, thought she had trapped nerve, but found out she has MS

Stretching her arms above her head in the gym, Nikki Cooper felt a shock run from her neck to the base of her spine.

 ‘It lasted two seconds and it was like someone walking over your grave — but with a spark running through it,’ says Nikki, who was then 28 and in training for a rowing race. ‘I was working my arm muscles hard, so I blamed that.’

Over the next month, the sensation recurred every few days. Looking up the symptoms online, she diagnosed a trapped nerve in her neck. Six weeks later she went to her GP. Nikki, who was an investment banker, was given tests to check her balance and grip — these proved normal. ‘The doctor agreed that it was a trapped nerve.’

But this was not a harmless sports injury. In fact, Nikki — now 32, who lives in Guildford, Surrey, with her husband Steven, 33, a banker — was experiencing the beginnings of multiple sclerosis.

This debilitating neurological condition, which affects around 100,000 people in Britain, happens when the immune system attacks healthy nerve fibres running between the brain and spinal cord.

The nerves become inflamed, leading to muscle spasm, blurred eyesight or loss of vision, dizziness, numbness and tingling limbs. There is no cure, and it can cause varying degrees of disability, and eventually in some cases, paralysis.

There is no clear cause for MS but one theory is that it is linked to a lack of vitamin D, obtained from the skin’s exposure to sunlight.

The condition is more common in the Northern Hemisphere, and as Dr Waqar Rashid, a consultant neurologist at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, explains: ‘The further away you are from the equator, the more likely you are to develop MS.’

Doctors also do not understand why MS affects three times more females than males — and the ratio is widening, says Dr Raj Kapoor, an MS specialist and consultant at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London.

MS is also on the increase worldwide. Again, it’s not clear why, although Dr Kapoor says: ‘Some wonder about the impact of the modern lifestyle and diet. But MS doesn’t discriminate; anybody can get it.

‘There are possible links to environmental factors such as viruses or bacteria — although no single infection has been identified as a trigger.’

The condition mainly affects the young, with up to 75 per cent of cases being diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40.

Nikki’s case highlights the difficulties in spotting MS. ‘My GP thought it was nothing to worry about, but referred me to a neurologist to make sure,’ she says. ‘When I saw my GP again after my diagnosis a couple of months later, she was shocked and upset.’

Dr Kapoor says: ‘I have great sympathy with GPs because a lot of people might have pins and needles or tingling, which can be due to any number of processes — such as a trapped nerve or vitamin deficiencies.’

The time taken for diagnosis varies because there is no single test for the condition.  When Nikki saw the neurologist in July 2009, he diagnosed Lhermitte’s sign — a nerve pain which causes electrical sensations down the back. ‘He told me it generally signifies a brain tumour or MS, but I thought: “No, that’s not me. I’m not sick”,’ she says.

Indeed, that weekend, Nikki ran a 10k race. But the next day she had severe muscle pain in her limbs, hands and feet. ‘It was only then I started worrying, and cried.’ She had an MRI scan and a lumbar puncture. Two weeks later, she and Steven saw the neurologist for the results.

The scan showed lesions around her spine, a sign of MS.

Dr Kapoor says lesions are like scars: ‘They are linked to damaged myelin, the substance surrounding nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Myelin insulates the nerve fibres and enables them to transmit impulses.’

As the neurologist confirmed the MS diagnosis, Nikki recalls: ‘I felt my whole world was caving in and I began sobbing. Steven and I wanted to start a family, but instead I saw myself confined to a wheelchair.’

Dr Rashid says: ‘Around 50 per cent of people require a walking aid or wheelchair 15 to 20 years after the first onset of symptoms. MS is unpredictable. The inflammation can clear up, and if it does, the nerve fibres can repair themselves.

‘There are cases of so-called “benign” MS, which stays mild throughout its course. But repeated attacks can leave permanent scarring.’

Nikki discovered no two cases of MS are the same: ‘There was no way of knowing if I’d be in a wheelchair at 40, or still running competitively at 50.’

Dr Kapoor says: ‘There are two main forms of MS; relapsing/remitting, and progressive. When symptoms get worse quickly this is known as a relapse. Periods when they improve or disappear are known as remissions.’

The soon-to-be mother-of-two is one of around 100,000 people affected by the debilitating neurological condition, where the immune system attacks healthy nerve fibres running between the brain and spinal cord

Progressive MS is characterised by worsening pain with fewer remissions, and increased likelihood of disability — or eventual paralysis. Treatment is centred around disease-modifying-drugs (DMDs), which interfere with the immune system and help prevent some relapses.

Nikki says: ‘I needed a positive attitude. After reading about studies in the U.S. advocating vitamins, supplements and fish oils to combat symptoms, I started taking them, and found my energy levels soared. I also exercised.’

She remained well enough to not require drugs, which meant she and Steven could start a family; their son William was born in July 2011. Her symptoms virtually disappeared during pregnancy.

However, in the months following William’s birth, her symptoms reappeared — with added facial numbness and weakened legs. ‘I feared I might not be able to care for William properly, or have any more children,’ she says.

On her neurologist’s advice, she started injecting a DMD called Rebif three times a week, and soon felt better. But a more serious relapse came in November last year. ‘I was reading my Kindle and I noticed a dark shadow across my left eye. I switched the light on, but it made no difference.

‘I’d gone completely blind in my left eye. After half an hour my sight returned. Next morning, I called my MS nurse, and she exp-lained it was optic neuritis.’

This is when the optic nerve is inflamed, disrupting messages from the eye to the brain. Nikki began frequently experiencing sporadic sight loss, and this still recurs now when she is overtired.

‘This is due to scarring from the original attack,’ says Dr Kapoor. ‘Symptoms are more likely to recur if the patient is tired or stressed.’

The setback prompted Nikki to quit her City job and focus on a range of vitamins and supplements she has developed specifically for women.

During another ‘remission’ earlier this year, she stopped her medication to try for another baby, and is due to give birth in early January.

‘I do have days where I worry, but I shut it out. There’s so much research going on that we have to remain hopeful.’

Dr Rashid agrees: ‘Advances are being made all the time, and there are four new therapies set for review by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Our ability to treat MS in the future is potentially very exciting.’

Nikki’s nutrient range, Inner Me, is available at Boots, Selfridges and Holland & Barrett from March 2014, innerme.co.uk. More information on MS at mssociety.org.uk
