Tia Sharp was probably smothered before her body was dumped in her grandmother’s loft, detectives suspect.

The 12-year-old was found wrapped in a black bed sheet and a black plastic bin bag.

A pathologist found no obvious major injuries to her body, leading to the theory that she was smothered or strangled.

In court: Tia Sharp's step-grandfather Stuart Hazell appeared before magistrates via video-link from a police station. He is charged with the girl's murder

Defendant: Stuart Hazell appeared at court via video-link after being charged with the murder of his step-granddaughter Tia Sharp

Accused: Stuart Hazell (left) appeared at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court charged with the murder of Tia Sharp (right), his partner's granddaughter

An initial examination uncovered 
bruising on her lower body but forensic experts have been hampered by 
the badly decomposed state of the corpse when it was finally recovered 
from the sweltering roof space last Friday.

Although Tia had clearly been dead for
some time, officers have not been able to rule out that the schoolgirl 
was alive when colleagues first visited the council house in New 
Addington, near Croydon, South London, after she vanished a week 
earlier.

The latest details came as her 
grandmother’s boyfriend Stuart Hazell, 37, appeared in court via video 
link accused of her murder.

The unemployed painter and decorator was not brought to court over fears a public appearance could attract a baying mob.

Loss: Police officers guard hundreds of floral tributes left by mourners near the house in New Addington, South London, where Tia's body was found

Flowers: Tia Sharp's father Steven Carter reads tributes left in memory of his daughter

Upset: Tia Sharp's father, Steven Carter, is supported by three women as he views the flowers left by mourners

Display of emotion: Tia's father Steven Carter is helped by police as he puts up a banner in his daughter's memory

Friday, August 3: Tia reported missing after apparently leaving her grandmother's home to visit a shopping centre.

Saturday, August 4: Police begin searching for her near the home in New Addington, South London.

Sunday, August 5 to Wednesday, August 8: Police scour CCTV, search woodland and use sniffer dogs but find no trace of the girl.

Thursday, August 9: Stuart Hazell denies wrongdoing in an emotional TV interview.

Friday, August 10: Tia's body is found in her grandmother's home. Hazell is arrested on suspicion of her murder.

Saturday, August 11: Scotland Yard apologises to Tia's mother for not finding her sooner, blaming 'human error.

Monday, August 13: Hazell appears at court charged with Tia's murder

Instead, just a handful of his former 
neighbours sat silently in the public gallery at Camberwell Green 
magistrates’ court for the five-minute hearing.

Wearing a dark blue T-shirt, Hazell 
spoke only to confirm he understood the charge he faces and his personal
details, giving his address as the house he shared with Tia’s 
grandmother Christine.

Holding a sheaf of paperwork, he sat at a desk 
with one woman police officer standing guard behind him in a room at 
Sutton Police Station, which had been the headquarters of the police 
search for Tia.

Magistrate Charu Joglekar ordered 
Hazell to appear at the Old Bailey on Wednesday, remanding him in 
custody.  Visiting a memorial of flowers, toys and tributes near Tia’s 
home yesterday, her natural father Steve Carter, 30, said: ‘I just want 
to get justice for my daughter, the proper way.

‘The last time I saw Tia she jumped in
my arms. She told me about her school and what she was doing. She 
called me Dad. I’ll miss her for ever.’

Mr Carter added that he hasn’t spoken to Tia’s mother, his ex-partner Natalie, since news broke of their daughter’s death.

Sympathy: Steven Carter and three women cry at the spot where mourners have gathered to pay their respects to Tia

He said: ‘I spoke to her before that, I
told her to go home and wait for her. I’ve not spoken to her since. 
She’s heartbroken, that’s her baby girl.’

Tia’s body was discovered a week after
she was reported missing on August 3, when a sniffer dog ‘indicated’ 
towards an area of upstairs carpet and the loft above.

Officers found Tia’s body in plain view in the loft.

Detectives are investigating whether 
her body was moved and whether this explains how it was missed during a 
two-hour search the previous Sunday.

Victim: Tia Sharp's body was found wrapped in a bed sheet and in a bag in the loft of her grandmother's home in New Addington, South London

Shock: Tia Sharp's mother Natalie sobs uncontrollably as she leaves a message of condolence

Tribute: David Niles, the partner of Tia Sharp's mother Natalie, lays flowers close to the schoolgirl's grandmother's house

Grief: Mourners comfort each other at a makeshift shrine for Tia Sharp near her grandmother's home in New Addington, South London

Retired police officers have expressed
disbelief that the house was not cleared and experts warned vital 
evidence may have been lost because of the delay.

There has been no sign of Tia’s 
46-year-old grandmother, a carer at a Croydon home for autistic 
children, since she was questioned on suspicion of murder and released 
on bail at the weekend.

She has been told she can never return home because of the anger of friends and neighbours.

Her next-door neighbour, Paul Meehan, 
39, was also absent after he was questioned on suspicion of assisting an
offender and released.

Inquiry: Christine Sharp's home in New Addington, South London, was searched by police with sniffer dogs

Investigation: A police officer stands guard near the house where the girl's body was discovered

Adjourned: The case was heard at Camberwell Green Magistrates' Court in South London
