Convicted 'speed freak killer' Wesley Shermantine was briefly released from his cell on death row this week to lead police to the remains of numerous victims he murdered decades ago.

Escorted out of California’s San Quentin State Prison, Shermantine led investigators to four wells in the town of Linden where they recovered numerous bones and other items.

At his return last Sunday he typed up a letter, addressed to Bounty Hunger Leonard Padilla, sharing where they had gone.

Digging: San Quentin State Prison deathrow inmate Wesley Shermantine led investigators to four wells, one pictured, where they recovered numerous bones and other items once belonging to his victims

Remains: Bones are seen at the site of one of the 45-feet-deep wells Shermantine led investigators to last Sunday

Mr Padilla released that letter to news station KTXL on Saturday.

'Leonard, I went out like I promised I would and showed them four wells,' Mr Padilla read.

'Three are close up, one is still open. At the trees I showed them where the well is,' he continued.

In all San Joaquin County Investigators reported finding pieces of human skulls, other bones, clothing and jewellery, dropped inside the 45-feet deep wells.

Serial killer: Wesley Shermantine, seen earlier in court, said this week that investigators missed finding what he called the boneyard, containing at least 12 victims he estimates

Deal: Shermantine's information comes from a pay deal made with a bounty hunter, prompting the inmate to send him a letter, pictured, recounting what they had done for his payment

'They missed the actual boneyard, the one that has most of the bodies in it. I would say there are 12 bodies in that well,' Padilla read.

The FBI reports having found four victims' bodies, including an unidentified woman and an unidentified foetus, since Shermantine began speaking out.

Shermantine's willingness to speak is the result of a payment deal between him and Mr Padilla.

Last year Mr Padilla gave Shermantine 
$28,000 to talk to him about the murders, revealing information in an 
effort to gain closure to the victims' families.

'I think it's very important that these 
relatives, the mothers, the fathers, get whatever they can back,' Mr 
Padilla told KTXL of his reasoning for his payments to Shermantine.

Recovery: San Joaquin County Investigators reported finding pieces of human skulls, other bones, clothing and jewellery, dropped inside the 45-feet deep wells

Earlier this year in a letter penned to California TV station CBS 13, Shermantine boasted of two burial sites he used with his accomplice Loren Herzog that had yet to be discovered.

The letter, sent from Death Row, also contained a lengthy complaint about his media portrayal and about the behaviour of his sister. It ends, 'Have a nice day.'

The bizarre letter was sent to the station's reporter Koula Gianulias at the end of a week when a search team found 1,000 bone fragments at a site previously named by Shermantine as the location of some of his and Herzog's victims.

He said the reason he had not revealed 
the other two sites was because at the time he hadn't been paid $33,000 
promised by Mr Padilla.

Prior letter: Earlier this year Shermantine sent a bizarre message to a California television station telling them he knew where more of his victims' bodies were

Mr Padilla, who recognised Shermantine's handwriting in the letter, had said he was working to establish a trust account before paying.

Shermantine began the letter by claiming that reports about him in the media were '90% lies', and repeating the assertion that Herzog, not Shermantine, was responsible for the deaths of up to 20 murder victims.

He then complained that he had been taken to hospital following a warning from his sister Barbara Jackson that he could be suicidal - Shermantine said: 'Her concern is about 13 years too late.'

The letter concluded: 'If you want to tell the truthful story you've got to offer me something. I've learned nothing's free any more in capitalism [sic] America,' with an invitation for Ms Gianulias to visit him in San Quentin prison.

All week crews have been sifting through mounds of dirt after information was provided by Shermantine revealing the location of his long-lost victims.

Investigators expanded the search after
authorities determined probably coming to the bottom of the first
well on the ranch about 12 miles outside of Stockton, San Joaquin 
Sheriff's Department spokesman Les Garcia said.

Officials said about 1,000 bone fragments were found buried on Calaveras County property once owned by Shermantine's family.

Mr Garcia could not provide any new numbers on how many bones or possible victims have been found at the time.

The first well, which was filled in by the owner in the mid to late 1980s, was being cleared so that a camera could be lowered into it. 

Cadaver dogs from Santa Clara County were brought in to detect if there are human remains left in the dirt cleared out, Mr Garcia said.

Close detail: Crews spent days searching the ranch in Linden, at what San Joaquin Sheriff's Department spokesman said was a 'slow and tedious' pace

Victims: The bodies of Cyndi Vanderheiden, left and Chevelle Wheeler, right, were found buried in California in the area identified by Shermantine in February

Missing: Michaela Garecht, nine, has still not been found since her abduction in November 1988

The search has already had a significant amount of success, as the bodies of two murder victims were found during those searches in February.

The
remains of two women- Chevelle 'Chevy' Wheeler disappeared while 
skipping school in 1985 aged 16, and Cyndi Vanderheiden, a 25-year-old 
last seen in front of her Linden home in 1998- were found during the 
search, giving their families some closure.

Dental records identified remains found Thursday in Calaveras County as those of 25-year-old Ms Vanderheiden, who disappeared.

Another set of remains were found
in the same area, and the parents of the missing 16-year-old girl have 
said authorities told them that Shermantine said their daughter was 
buried in that spot decades ago.

The bones and skulls that were discovered along with clothes, a purse 
and jewellery leads authorities to believe that there may be 10 or more 
victims.

Meanwhile, 65 calls have been made to a 
hotline set up by authorities for people who believe their loved ones 
might be among the victims of Shermantine and Herzog.

Earlier this year, Shermantine wrote to a local 
paper saying that Herzog was behind the abduction of Michaela Garecht, a 9-year-old was was snatched from the street in 1988.

He said that he 
would lead police to the spot where the pair used to bury their victims,
but she is still missing.

Shermantine is on death row after he was convicted in 2001 of four murders.

Investigators said the boyhood friends were suspected in as many as 20 murders as a result of a meth-fueled crime spree.

Herzog was convicted of three murders 
and sentenced to 77 years to life in prison. Herzog's sentence was 
reduced to 14 years after an appeals court tossed out his first-degree 
murder convictions because his confession had been illegally obtained.

Herzog was paroled in 2010 to a trailer outside the High Desert State 
Prison in Susanville.

He killed himself in January outside that trailer after learning Shermantine was disclosing the victims' locations.
