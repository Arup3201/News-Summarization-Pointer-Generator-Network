The family of a woman who was allegedly stabbed to death by her husband wept today as dramatic CCTV footage was played in court, showing the accused in blood-stained clothes carrying her three-year-old daughter and a kitchen knife from the murder scene

Turkish Ensar Gol stabbed his English bride Michala and her mother to death hours after posting a message on Facebook saying the pair would be cut, prosecutors have claimed.

The 22-year-old then picked up his wife’s young daughter and walked through the night-time streets, still brandishing the murder weapon, to a pizza restaurant, jurors have heard.

Jurors heard that before the killing spree, Gol wrote on Facebook: ‘Have a look, all the English papers will talk about me tomorrow. The crazy wolf Turkish Turk who covered London in blood. The knife is ready, you know I’m handy with a knife.'

It is claimed that just hours after posting the message, Gol returned to home and stabbed his sleeping wife Michala to death in their marital bed.

His mother-in-law, Julie Sahin and family friend, Casey Wilson, who were watching TV downstairs, rushed to Michala’s aid and found Gol perched over her repeatedly plunging the knife into her neck.

Dangerous: He approached the fast food pizza restaurant and on the CCTV footage he could be seen putting down the youngster, before making an animated phone call, with the blade still grasped in his hand

Back down: Eventually as police arrive he throws away the weapon before lying face down on the ground, arms stretched out in front of him

Ms Wilson, aged 19 years, managed to pull the Turkish-born restaurant worker off her 28-year-old friend but was herself stabbed multiple times.

She managed to flee from the house but tragically Mrs Sahin was trapped in the bedroom with her knife-wielding son-in-law.

Prosecutor Dafydd Enoch told the jury that Gol repeatedly stabbed Mrs Sahin, again targeting her neck.

He said she put up a struggle but was found at the bottom of the stairs in a pool of blood, by paramedics.

Along with the CCTV footage of his movement on the night, an audio recording of a 999 call by a shocked neighbour in the early hours of September 4 was played.

The crackling sound of the witness’ voice could be heard saying: 'Please, please, my neighbour - this man is beating the crap out of this women and they’ve got kids.'

The panicked caller added: 'Sorry, I’m shaking because my next door neighbour’s getting beaten up bad.'

The lone figure of Gol could be seen on the CCTV video walking quickly through empty streets clutching the girl to his chest and brandishing a blade in the other hand.

The restaurant worker entered an open square in the town centre where he approached the fast food pizza restaurant.

The court has previously heard he told his father-in-law Mehmet Sahin, was working there: 'You didn’t believe me but I done it.'

On the CCTV footage he could be seen putting down the youngster, who initially tried to follow him as he walked away from the shop.

However, he beckoned her back before making an animated phone call, with the blade still grasped in his hand.

He was then heard saying in Turkish on a mobile phone: 'I told you I’d cut them, didn’t I? Would I lie to you?'

An unsuspecting smoker at one stage even walked up to ask for a light before seeing the knife and hurrying away, the court heard.

Detective Sergeant Phil Jones, of Thames Valley Police, explained: 'He goes up, sees the knife and thinks better of it.'

Eventually as police arrive he throws away the weapon before lying face down on the ground, arms stretched out in front of him, where he is arrested, in Thame Town Centre.

Mr Enoch told the jury that Gol had been unhappy in the marriage, after getting wed to Michala following a holiday romance in his native Turkey in March 2011.

The prosecuter said that Gol had met up with another woman in a pub and had sex with her on the evening of the killings.

He later returned home where he messaged a friend on Facebook and said he would 'cut the lot of them tonight.'

He also posted in Turkish: 'I will cut the mother-in-law and wife, brother,' before bragging about being in the newspapers, said Mr Enoch.

He revealed that Gol and Michala met in Turkey whilst she was on holiday and she soon fell pregnant.

Gol moved to England to be with her and their son and they married soon after.

He said Gol had never been happy or settled in the UK and the relationship was rocky with lots of arguments.

He added that his relationship with Mrs Sahin had been 'very strained.'

Gol, who worked at Prezzo restaurant, moved back to Turkey on several occasions during the short marriage but always returned because of the two children, who cannot be named for legal reasons.

Mr Enoch said that in the course of one of the separations Michala had sexual relations with a past boyfriend and Gol had found out about it which caused several arguments.

In opening the prosecution case, he said: 'You can imagine the scene which greeted the paramedics.

'It was something which resembled a scene from an X-rated horror film.

'He walked to the town centre carrying the knife he had just used to kill his wife and mother-in-law.

'He wandered around on the street talking on his mobile phone.

'He was heard to say: ‘The woman married to me will have to do what I say or this will happen.’

'He was controlled and calculated before the killings, during the killings and in the aftermath of the killings,” said Mr Enoch.

'This was a deliberate attack by the defendant, one that when he came into that house for the last time he intended to do.'

Gol denies the charges - he faces two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder.

The trial continues.
