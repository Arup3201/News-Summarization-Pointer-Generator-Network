She's launched a successful modelling career, served as a body double for Cheryl Fernandez-Versini and is one of the stars of Celebrity Big Brother. 

But this is just the beginning for Chloe Goodman.

The 21-year-old model is keen to prove that she's both beauty and brains and she's kicking things off by launching her own  capsule collection of bikinis for Bahimi before she's even left the house.

The seven-piece range consists of stylish and bold designs named after Chloe's favourite drinks, all modelled by Miss Goodman herself, of course.

Priced between £40-£45, the range includes the apple martini bikini, the absinthe bikini and the Chambord Perrier bikini.

Speaking to MailOnline, Chloe's sister Lauryn revealed: 'I think Chloe would like to do her own fashion range, possibly in the summer, because she always puts cute outfits together. 

'People have been paying a lot of interest to her clothes and make-up since she's been in the house so maybe she will do both!'.

On last night's show, Chloe gave fans a teaser of her pert posterior when she flashed her bottom and said Perez Hilton  can 'kiss my a***'.

The model was taking part in a talent competition requested by the new King and Queen of the house, Perez and Cami Li, when she pulled down her trousers in front of the other Housemates and bore her behind. 

Speaking ahead of entering the show, down-to-earth Chloe said: 'I think people will realise that I'm not the sexy one when I get comfortable! I'll have my hair up, no make up on, sweats on. 

'I haven't labelled myself as the pretty one because I don't know who is going in. I might be the ugly one.'

Judging by her latest campaign pictures, she was wrong.  

Chloe shot to fame on reality show Ex On The Beach but revealed that she wants to use her time in the Big Brother house to show the 'real her'

Speaking ahead of going on the show, Chloe, who models her mojito bikini, said: 'I've been watching CBB for years and I want to show the real me instead of me on a show like Ex On The Beach'
