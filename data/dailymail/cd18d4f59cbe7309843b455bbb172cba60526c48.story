Once, being a WAG was simply a matter of looking good in a frock and finding a footballer to marry you. Not any more. Today's variety are a very different breed, with some so high powered that their career eclipses that of their sporty other half.

Leading the pack are platinum selling songstress, Shakira - who is Colombia's answer to Beyonce - and supermodel Irina Shayk. They've forged their own careers and amassed such personal fortunes that they will never need to be financially reliable on their rich footballer boyfriends.

And they are not alone. From top rank journalists to actresses, models and chart-topping singers, the WAGs arriving in Rio for this year's World Cup have far more than just shopping on their minds.

One of the best-known of the WAGs heading to the World Cup, the 28-year-old model, who hails from the town of Yemanzhelinsk on Russia's border with Kazakhstan, shot to fame in 2010 when she starred in the video for Kanye West's Power.

Since then, the model's career has gone from strength to strength with shoots for Sports Illustrated, Harper's Bazaar and Elle, as well as campaigns for Intimissimi and Lacoste.

Irina, who has been in a relationship with Real Madrid and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo, 29, since 2010, recently appeared in a Mario Testino shoot for Spanish Vogue and will co-star with The Rock in a remake of Hercules due out later this year.

SHAKIRA - MEGASTAR

Singer Shakira is a global star having sold more than 70 million albums worldwide and won numerous accolades including two Grammy Awards.

Success in the UK came with her album Laundry Service, featuring the song Whenever, Wherever, and Underneath Your Clothes. She later scored number one singles with Hips Don't Lie and Beautiful Liar, performed with Beyonce.  

The 37-year-old first met Gerard Piqué, 27, when filming the video for her 2010 World Cup song, Waka Waka. They began dating soon after that tournament, which was won by the Barcelona centre-back and his Spanish team-mates. Last year, they had their first child together, a son, Milan.

The singer has another World Cup related single released for this year's tournament - the imaginatively titled La, La, La - and her partner once again features in the video.
