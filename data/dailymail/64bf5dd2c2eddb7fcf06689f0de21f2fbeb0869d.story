Police have launched an investigation after eight decomposing bodies, including a baby, were discovered inside an abandoned funeral home.

Officers said the corpses were left unattended after the mortuary service was told to move out of the building in Fort Worth, Texas.

Sgt Raymond Bush said the property owner told Johnson Family Mortuary to vacate the building two weeks ago.

He says the landlord returned yesterday morning to find the bodies in the premises, but no workers.

Sgt Bush said the bodies were not refrigerated and were in various stages of decomposition.

Homicide detectives spent hours at the scene and are now trying to trace relatives of the deceased, he added.

No arrests have been made or charges filed.

Twin brothers, Dondre and Derrick 
Johnson, who own the funeral business, have denied neglect, saying they 
did not deliberately leave the bodies behind and that they were treated properly.

Dondre
 Johnson told CBS 11 News: 'We've done nothing wrong. I have some 
embalmed bodies back there, which ya'll had seen them bring out.

'They were already in the casket, already had a funeral [and] one was ready to go to Nairobi.'

The brothers, who feature in a TV reality show about their business, blamed the owners for causing the confusion by trying to throw them out of the business.

He added: 'We don’t do business like that.

'Being a professional, I’ve been in the funeral service over 25 years and I’m going to continue to serve my community.'

The Tarrant County Medical Examiner's Office has taken custody of the bodies.

Texas Funeral Service Commission attorney Kyle Smith says the mortuary's state license expires this month and it is the focus of five commission investigations after receiving a number of complaints.

Sgt Bush said: 'Our primary concern at this point is to make sure that the Medical Examiner’s Office gets everything it needs from us to properly take care of the people that were left in the building.'
