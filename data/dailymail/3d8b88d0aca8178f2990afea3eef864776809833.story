Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen can resonate exactly with what Liverpool are going through in terms of a rebuilding job this season after going through similar at White Hart Lane last term.

The 23-year-old was one of a host of summer signings to arrive at Tottenham last summer in an attempt to fill the gap of star man Gareth Bale last summer.

But things didn't quite pan as Spurs would have liked as they yet again finished outside of the Champions League places, despite spending £110million on a number of new additions.

Similarities: Christian Eriksen believes Tottenham and Liverpool have gone through near identical transitions

Celebrations: After a superb start to the season Eriksen and co will be eyeing a top four spot at Spurs this year

Liverpool have splashed the cash this summer with a number of new additions in the hope of filling the void of star man Luis Suarez who joined Spanish giants Barcelona.

But Eriksen says there is no guarantee of instant success when so many players are brought in such a short space of time telling The Evening Standard: 'It is true that we went through [what Liverpool are now facing] last year. It will depend on what team they have and what the new players are bringing in. Everything has to fit.

'Sometimes you are lucky and sometimes you are a bit unlucky. Last year we made some really good signings, I think.

'We were just a bit unlucky that nothing really ended up in a big thing. Of course, that can happen with Liverpool as well so sometimes you are lucky and sometimes you aren't.'

Spurs will look to extend their 100% start to the season when they entertain Brendan Rodgers' side on Sunday, who in turn will be be looking to get back to winning ways after losing 3-1 against champions Manchester City on Monday night.
