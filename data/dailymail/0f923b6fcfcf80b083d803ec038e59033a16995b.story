A five-month-old baby who never woke up from his afternoon nap had enterovirus, it has emerged.

Lancen Kendall was pronounced brain dead and passed away five days after he was put down for a nap in his Phoenix, Arizona home earlier this month.

Doctors initially told his devastated parents that he had succumbed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), but they have since confirmed that he also had enterovirus.

They are still waiting to find out whether he had enterovirus 68, the particular strain that has claimed at least two other children's lives and has been diagnosed in nearly 700 people across the U.S.

Tragic: Lancen Kendall passed away earlier this month, five days after he failed to wake up from a nap

Kevin  Kendall told Fox10 how he put his son down for a nap and was horrified when he saw him turning blue, particularly because the youngster had shown no symptoms and had not cried.

'I checked on him halfway through his nap, for him not to be breathing an hour and a half later, it's a terrifying ordeal,' he told the channel. 'It was a very scary moment.'

The youngster was rushed to Banner Thunderbird Medical Center. Doctors found a pulse but declared him brain dead, and he passed away five days later.

The couple, who have older sons, said doctors told them it was SIDS but a few days later they said there also seemed to be more to his death.

Doctors said he had tested positive for enterovirus and are now trying to determine the strain.

The parents said they had never even heard of the illness and have no idea how the little boy would have contracted it.

'The only thing that can come good out of this now is just to get it out there and let people know this is happening,' his mother Kathleen said. 'Our baby didn't show any symptoms and it was terrifying.'

His father Kevin added to 3TV: 'The lack of warning is the scariest part to me. We didn't know he was sick.'

3TV reported that he is one of 24 recent enterovirus cases across the state.

At least two other U.S. children have been killed by the virus.

Madeline Reid, from Detroit, Michigan, was paralyzed by the illness and was put on life support on September 14. The 21-month-old girl died last week.

Her death followed that of four-year-old Eli Waller, from Hamilton, New Jersey, who passed away on September 25 after failing to wake up after a night's sleep.

The virus, which displays flu-like symptoms, has also been linked to other deaths, including that of 10-year-old Emily Otrando, from Rhode Island, who died on September 22. 

Widespread: 700 people have been diagnosed with the virus. A map from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows how cases changed within states in the week October 5 to October 11

In total, 691 people have been affected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.

The majority of the cases are believed to be children. Only Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and Alaska have not seen any cases.

This week, the CDC said that 32 states and the District of Columbia have reported low or declining incidents of the illness, while 12 states reporting increasing or elevated activity.

The illness, which has flu and cold-like symptoms, causes severe respiratory illness and can lead to difficulty breathing in infants and young children, officials have said. 

Children under age five who have asthma or other respiratory problems seem to be especially susceptible.

Enteroviruses, which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold, aren't unusual and peak usually in September into fall.

They usually resemble a bad cold, but this particular strain has become worrisome for parents across the US after a number of fatalities among children

What is proving so worrisome about this particular strain?

ED-D68 was first identified in the 1960s and is uncommon, but has been cropping up in recent years in Georgia, Pennsylvania and abroad in Japan and the Netherlands.

However, the bottom line is that experts cannot explain why it is has flared so dramatically this year.

They also cannot explain why it is proving so virulent.

Signs and symptoms

ED-D68 begins as a cold, with coughing, fever and wheezing.

The virus can cause breathing difficulties but most recover well after a week.

How serious is it?

While experts have said that in theory some cases can become so severe they result in death, many of the EV-D68 infections 'will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,' according to the Missouri health agency said.

How can infection be prevented?

This particular enterovirus is spread through bodily contact. Making children far more susceptible.

Health officials have said there is not much that can be done about it other than washing hands with soap and disinfecting surfaces.

There's no vaccine for EV-D68
