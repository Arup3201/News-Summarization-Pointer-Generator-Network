Blaise Matuidi claims PSG are 'consumed by fear' after their disappointing 1-1 draw with Monaco in Ligue 1.

The French champions impressed in Europe by beating Barcelona but again fell victim to a late equaliser in their domestic exploits, and Matuidi fears their lapses in concentration are becoming an issue.

Speaking to L'Equipe, Matuidi said: 'It's happened again. It's a bad habit - it's got to stop. We were too pensive tonight and I am sure that's why we conceded that goal.

Blaise Matuidi said PSG are 'consumed by fear' and it is causing them to drop valuable points in the league

'When you allow yourself to be consumed by fear, it won't show you any mercy, and so that's what happens. We lacked, noticeably at the end, personality and character. We have to put a stop to that quickly or we'll lose more points.'

Laurent Blanc's side find themselves seven points adrift of table-topping Marseille and two points behind second-placed Bordeaux. 

'Everybody wants to be up there,' he said. 'But to be up there we have to do whatever is necessary. If we're not up there today, it's because we haven't done that.

'I hope we all come back with a winning mindset after these next 15 days because, right now in the championship, we don't have one. I also hope we get back the world-class players we are missing and who make us a great team.'
