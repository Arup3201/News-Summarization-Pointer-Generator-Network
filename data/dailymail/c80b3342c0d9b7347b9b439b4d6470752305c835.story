A gene regulating our body clock may stop us piling on the pounds and could be used to create anti obesity drugs, researchers claim.

Researchers found that the 'neuropeptide Y system' (NPY), may play a central role in determining how fat we become.

They compared the NPY system in mice with humans and found an important difference.

Radical: A gene which regulates the body clock as well as growth hormone production could be used to combat obesity in humans

In humans the neurotransmitter communicates with four well-known 'cell surface receptors' in the brain (Y1, Y2, Y4 and Y5) which trigger the system's effects.

However mice have an additional receptor, Y6, which has a profound effect on their body composition.

It is produced in the part of the brain that regulates the body clock as well as growth hormone production.

Scientists may have discovered a gene which could control how fat we become

Researchers deleted the gene in mice to understand its effects on body fat.

They found that mice without the Y6 gene were smaller and had less lean tissue than normal mice.

On the other hand as they aged they became fatter than normal mice especially when on a high-fat diet.

The mice on a high fat diet actually became obese and developed metabolic problems similar to diabetes.

Although
 the Y6 receptors are different in humans, the findings, published in 
Cell Metabolism, could help researchers develop anti-obesity drugs in 
the future.

Professor Amanda
 Sainsbury-Salis, from the Garvan Institute in Sydney, said: 'I find it 
amazing that one gene, which is expressed in the small part of the brain
 that controls the body clock, has such a profound impact on how much 
fat is stored on the body, and how much lean tissue is maintained.

'Importantly, we use mice as models of human beings in research, and so when looking for anti-obesity drugs, we need to fully understand the function of the NPY system in this animal model to understand how similar circuits in humans connect with the body clock.'
