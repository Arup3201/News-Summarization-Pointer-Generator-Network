The 'Stop The Boats' campaign has not come cheap, with almost $23million spent in a little over a year trying to stop 'illegal immigrants'.

A report in the Sydney Morning Herald claims the overseas commercial strategy used by the current Coalition Government and the previous Labor leadership has already swallowed up all funds allocated for four years, in just the past 12-months.

Several countries have been targeted by the push to stop people smuggling at the source; including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran.

It's been reported that almost $23million has been spent in a little over a year on advertising campaigns trying to stop 'illegal immigrants'

Advertisements have been produced in several different languages with the most widely played being 'By boat, no visa' and 'No way. You will not make Australia home'

The ad campaigns have been splashed across all media with a particular emphasis on television and on-line platforms.

They have been produced in several different languages with the most widely played being 'By boat, no visa' and 'No way. You will not make Australia home'.

The latter has been played in languages like Urdu and Albanian and is fronted by Lieutenant General Angus Campbell.

According to the Fairfax Media report, the Australian Audit Office has produced documentation on request of Senate Estimates, showing the Immigration and Customs departments have spent $22,695,994.

Would-be Sri Lankan asylum seekers have been targeted by the 'Don't throw your money into water' message.

Prime Minister Abbott has previously described the stopping the boats policy as the 'most compassionate' thing his government could have done

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Abbott described the stopping the boats policy as the 'most compassionate' thing his government could have done.

Mr Abbott added that secure borders were a sign of a sovereign nation.

He said stopping the boats meant an end to budget blow-outs, saving billions in unnecessary future spending and ending deaths.

Australia also has plans to reintroduce a
controversial temporary visa system to deal with a huge backlog
of asylum seekers,
despite criticism the stopgap process leaves refugees in limbo.

Mr Abbott campaigned heavily on tough immigration policies, which, while it has been the subject of criticism internationally has remained popular with voters, according to polling.

The Federal Government has sought to bring back temporary protection visas (TPV) for refugees

The return of the TPV has met with criticism. The policy was a significant part of the Howard Government, before being abolished in 2008

Australia uses offshore detention centres in Papua New
Guinea and the South Pacific island nation of Nauru to
process would-be refugees who arrive on boats, but thousands who arrived before the policy was set have faced lengthy delays for processing in
Australian detention centres.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said that the Temporary
Protection Visas (TPV), which were introduced under former PM John Howard and abolished in 2008, would address people without providing inducements to people smugglers.

'TPVs will provide refugees with stability and a chance to
get on with their lives, while at the same time guaranteeing
that people smugglers do not have a 'permanent protection visa
product' to sell to those who are thinking of travelling
illegally to Australia,' he said. 

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young says 'spending taxpayer money on a self-promoting fear campaign like this is obscene'

Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young hit out at the government's advertising spend, accusing them of using taxpayer dollars on propaganda.

'Spending taxpayer money on a self-promoting fear campaign like this is obscene,' she told Fairfax Media.
