For more than 30 years HMS Illustrious sailed the oceans as a powerful symbol of Britain's proud maritime history.

But today ministers raised the prospect
that Illustrious could meet an undignified end in a wrecking yard 
being turned into tin cans and razor blades.

Now they have issued a desperate plea to anyone with a few million pounds to spare to buy the 22,000-tonne warship and turn it into a tourist attraction.

Warning: Ministers are desperate to find a buyer for HMS Illustrious to prevent her facing an undignified end being broken up for scrap

Ministers last year promised the 25,000-tone floating fortress would be preserved as a lasting tribute to the Royal Navy's Invincible-class aircraft carriers when it completes active service in 2014.

The pledge came after her two sister warships - Invincible, and Ark Royal - were both controversially sold for scrap metal for around £3million.

Defence Minister Philip Dunne played down concerns at the time that an important part of the UK's naval heritage would be lost by insisting: 'It is important that we preserve the legacy of the Invincible-class aircraft carriers.'

But today Mr Davies admitted it could also end up on the scrap heap unless a benefactor can be found.

He said the vessel, currently serving as a helicopter carrier on military war games in the Mediterranean, could be broken up unless a buyer comes forward to preserve it as a tourist attraction.

Huge: The 210-metre (689ft) long ship - based in Portsmouth - was built by Swan Hunter on Tyneside and launched in 1978

In a Commons statement he warned the carrier could be sold for recycling if no suitable bids were received.

He said: 'HMS Illustrious, the last of these three iconic ships, is due to retire from service with the Royal Navy in 2014.

'The Ministry of Defence's Disposal Services Authority (DSA) has launched a competition which will seek innovative re-use bids to retain the ship in the UK, with part or all of it developed for heritage purposes.'

He said organisations would be expected to put forward 'mature and viable proposals, in keeping with the role and history of the Invincible class of ships'.

Proposals to turn HMS Illustrious - nicknamed Lusty - into a floating museum and tourist attraction to lure thousands of visitors are already being drawn up.

In 2006, the crew of HMS Illustrious spelt out the message 'Happy 80th' to mark the Queen's birthday

But Mr Dunne warned: 'In the event that no suitable re-use bids with a heritage element are submitted, the DSA will open up the competition by seeking proposals for other uses or recycling.'

The ship is 210-metre (689ft) - the equivalent of 18 double-decker buses.

Based in Portsmouth, was built by Swan Hunter on Tyneside and launched in 1978.

She relieved HMS Invincible in the Falklands after the 1982 conflict and was involved in the Gulf War and the conflict in Afghanistan in 2001, and supported evacuations from Sierra Leone in 2000 and Lebanon in 2006.

HMS Illustrious was converted to be used as the navy's helicopter carrier following the Government's decision to sell the Harrier jets which operated from its flightdeck.

The decision left the Royal Navy without an aircraft carrier until the new Queen Elizabeth class enters service later this decade.

HMS Queen Elizabeth, which is almost complete, will begin sea trials in 2017 before undertaking flight trials with the F-35 Lightning II aircraft in 2018.
