The father of the woman murdered by philandering music teacher Andrew Lindo spoke of the killer’s ‘monstrous and evil deceit’ yesterday after he was jailed for a minimum of 22 years.

Robert Stewart, 55, choked back tears as he described Lindo as ‘a coward of the first order’ and a cheat with an enormous ego who ‘delivered an acting masterclass’ to conceal his womanising and his terrible crime.

‘He has lied, misled, abused, cheated and stolen from us on a monstrous scale.’

The murder victim's father Robert Stewart, pictured outside Bradford Crown Court today, described Andrew Lindo as a 'coward' after he was jailed for life

Guilty: Andrew Lindo murdered his fiancée Marie Stewart who was found dead at the family home in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire

Lindo, 29, strangled, battered and 
stabbed Marie Stewart, his fiancée and the mother of his two little 
children, last December after she found out he was cheating on her with 
another woman.

He hid her body in the garage and convinced friends and family she had left him for another man.

On Christmas Day, a week after the 
murder, Mr Stewart spent time with Lindo and the children at their home 
in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, whilst his daughter’s body lay only a few 
feet away. He was fooled into thinking she had walked out on her fiancé.

Outside Bradford Crown Court Mr 
Stewart, a sales consultant, said: ‘It is difficult to imagine a more 
gut-wrenching experience than to be told that your daughter’s body has 
been found in the garage of their family home.’

He said Lindo’s actions in hiding the body for seven weeks before he was arrested ‘compounded’ the family’s suffering.

Mr Stewart said Lindo lived in a fantasy world.

‘He delivered an acting masterclass 
to the world and his unfortunate female victims and painted Marie as a 
lazy, feckless mother who had abandoned her children for a “better 
life”. He stopped at nothing to blacken her name in the very worst 
possible terms.’

Lindo is known to have cheated on 
Miss Stewart with four others – including a girl music pupil aged only 
15 – during the months before the murder.

Mr Stewart added: ‘He presented and 
cultivated this image of the perfect father figure whilst juggling 
affairs with numerous unsuspecting women, often at the same time, to 
further indulge his enormous ego. Andrew Lindo has blighted the lives of
 his children for ever and caused irreparable pain to us all.’
