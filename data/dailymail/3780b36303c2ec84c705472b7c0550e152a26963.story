A convicted rogue trader's bizarre attempt to evade justice has ended after he walked across to the French border to face jail.

After a legal saga that captured the national imagination, a pilgrimage to the Pope and a plea for presidential clemency, the former Societe Generale trader Jerome Kerviel finally handed himself in.

For weeks, Kerviel had been 
marching to Paris from Rome where he met the Pope earlier this year, in 
protest 'against the tyranny of financial markets'.

He had been followed
 by a crowd of reporters and live television crews.

But last night he was shown in footage broadcast on French television crossing the border from Italy to France by foot.

A police official in the French border town of Menton said Kerviel was in custody in a local precinct just after a midnight deadline to begin serving his sentence.

It was not immediately clear when or where he would be taken to prison.

Kerviel cost Societe Generale 4.9 billion euros ($6.4bn; £4bn)  in losses in 2008, rocking the banking world just before the financial market meltdown.

He argued that the bank had quietly welcomed his unauthorised trades when they made money, but turned against him when his trades turned sour.

Kerviel, who has spent two months walking from Rome to protest his treatment by the courts, resumed his march toward France where he he was arrested shortly before the midnight deadline at which he had to check into a French police station

Kerviel gained nationwide supporters and turned himself into a crusader against a corrupt financial world

French judges found Kerviel guilty 
anyway. He was sentenced to three years in prison in a 2010 verdict that
 was upheld recently by France's highest court.

But he gained nationwide supporters and turned himself into a crusader against a corrupt financial world.

'The fight will continue regardless of what happens,' he told journalists while walking toward the border on Sunday night.

Before the deadline to begin serving 
his sentence, Kerviel traveled to Italy to meet the pope and on Saturday
 appealed to French President Francois Hollande to intervene. Hollande's
 office said it would consider a specific request for mercy 'according 
to the usual procedure.'

But Finance Minister Michel Sapin described Kerviel on Sunday as a criminal.

'The
 crook is caught, the crook is convicted, the crook should of course 
serve his sentence,' Sapin said Sunday on LCI television.

An internal report by Societe Generale found that managers failed to follow up on 74 different alarms about Kerviel's activities. A few executives resigned, and Kerviel's superiors were questioned, but none faced charges.

In March, France's highest appeal court upheld his three-year jail term. But it quashed 4.9 billion euros in civil damages that judges had ordered Kerviel to pay to compensate SocGen for its losses when the bank unwound the trader's positions in the midst of the financial crisis.

Over the weekend, Kerviel appealed to French President Francois Hollande to give immunity to unnamed witnesses he said would be willing to testify in his favour. He claimed he was not guilty and that his criminal conviction was unfair.

The French president's office has only replied that if Kerviel asked for presidential grace, his request would be examined according to usual procedures. Kerviel rejected that offer, saying it would imply an admission of guilt on his part.

In an emailed statement on Saturday, a spokesman for Societe Generale criticized the media hype around Kerviel. He said Kerviel had been the subject of a meticulous investigation, judged three times and found guilty each time.
