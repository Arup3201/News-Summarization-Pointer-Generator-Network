Former Newcastle United striker Micky Quinn insists the club are doomed under owner Mike Ashley - as he is only interested in making money.

On Monday it was revealed that John Carver would be remaining in caretaker charge of Newcastle until the end of the season - a move Quinn says highlights the distinct lack of ambition at the club.

Speaking on the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show Quinn said: 'It wasn't a surprise was it? (Carver getting the caretaker job until May). It is the cheaper option for the club.

Micky Quinn, who works as a radio pundit on talkSport, believes the club is rotting away under Mike Ashley

Quinn scored 59 league goals in 115 appearances for the Magpies between 1989 and 1992

'There is just no ambition and while Ashley is there the soul of the club is rotting away slowly. He is only interested in making money.

'There has been no improvement in the team since John took over. 

'He might just show people what he is made of, but the jury is out as far as I am concerned. Is he good enough for Newcastle? 

'Based on the last five games, no, he is not good enough. 

Quinn sees a bleak future for Newcastle under the ownership of owner Ashley

Newcastle fans display a banner calling for former manager Alan Pardew and owner Ashley to leave the club

John Carver has been handed control of Newcastle's last 16  matches and could land the job on full-time basis

Newcastle's last outing was a 2-1 defeat by Southampton at St James' Park in the Premier League

'It smacks very much of a lack of ambition. It is an insult to the fans at the end of the day.' 

Quinn has previously said that the next manager at Newcastle should be a Geordie, insisting he would  walk to St James' Park to manage the club.

Newcastle lie 11th in the Premier League with just over half the season played and face a trip to struggling Hull on Saturday as they look to bounce back from three straight defeats.
