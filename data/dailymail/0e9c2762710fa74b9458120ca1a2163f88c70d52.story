Father Paul Coleman said he was 'devastated' to hear of the death of Nicole's father, Antony Kidman

The Catholic priest who officiated at the wedding of Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban has spoken about the loss of the Oscar-winning actress's father.

Long-time friend of the family Father Paul Coleman said he is 'devastated' by the news of Dr Kidman's death from a fall in a Singapore hotel room.

The Sydney parishioner - who first met Dr Kidman when his oldest daughter was a student at North Sydney Girls school - said he was a good man and a 'great husband to his wife' who he regularly dined with.

Father Coleman first met Nicole's parents at her confirmation when she was 12 - but knew Nicole from her time at North Sydney Girls School where he taught scripture. 

'I knew him very well and I found him to be an honourable man, an upstanding person who was kind and generous,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I often dined with them (the Kidmans) and admired the good work he did in the community and at the Royal North Shore centre.'

Dr Kidman was a clinical psychologist at Royal North Shore Hospital and a director of health psychology at the University of Technology Sydney.

A friend of the family confirmed on Friday that Dr Kidman died from a fall in his Singapore hotel room while visiting his youngest daughter, Antonia, and six grandchildren.

Father Coleman met Dr Kidman through Nicole when he was a scripture teacher at North Sydney Girls High School, before he participated in the confirmation of the Oscar-winning actress when she was about 12.

He visited the school once a week for scripture teachings, up until when he left the The Parishes of Our Lady of the Way in 1986, but kept a closely-held relationship with the Kidmans that would see him unite Nicole and husband Keith Urban in 2006.

When the pair advertised that they were engaged and wanted a traditional Catholic wedding down under, Father Coleman was the man trusted with the official duties at a ceremony in front of 238 friends and family at Manly, in Sydney's north.

He said he was 'humbled' by the opportunity to marry and counsel them on the meaning of a romantic marriage.

'I just prepared them,' he said, which involved advising the Hollywood actress and her country-rock husband on the 'importance of what they were doing.'

'I'm not married myself but I tried to draw them to the messages of marriage.'

He also baptised their second child, Faith, in the NSW southern highlands.

Father Coleman was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1948, and worked as a Father at the The Parishes of Our Lady of the Way from 1975 to 1986. 

He now spends most of his time working as a chaplain at Sydney's Mater Hospital where he visits ill patients and hospital staff.

Father Coleman said he was being inundated with phone calls on Friday night in relation to Dr Kidman's tragic death.

'The family are shocked and everyone is ringing me up -  they are all shocked.' 

'He was very open, a warm and friendly person of good character,' he said.
