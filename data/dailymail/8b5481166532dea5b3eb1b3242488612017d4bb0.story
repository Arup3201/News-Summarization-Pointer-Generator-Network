A former teen tearaway with more than 50 convictions for violent crime has been crowned the country’s top student after miraculously turning her life around.

Natalie Atkinson, 25, did six stints in secure children’s homes and seven terms in prison during a chaotic eight-year spell which saw her locked-up with rapists, murderers and drug-dealers.

But in a remarkable tale of redemption she has now gained a degree in Criminology with first class honours and is preparing to start her Masters at the London School of Economics.

She first 
got into trouble aged 12, quit school in year nine and fell out with her
 family, leading her into a life of foster care, self-harm and alcohol 
dependency.

'I
 was out of control. I was drinking all the time and fighting. I had a 
lot of built up anger, a lot of upset. I started falling out with my 
family and I ended up in the care system.

Natalie Atkinson proudly gained first class honours for her Criminology dissertation, despite teenage years being spent in a life of crime and violence which started at the age of 12

'After a few years I got sick of finding myself in the same situation and decided things need to change.

'I had a lot of supportive people around me and class myself as lucky. Not everyone has that support.'

Natalie had many run-ins with the police and earned more than 50 criminal convictions, mostly for assault and battery.

After landing a job with a housing association aged 21, she then made the most of her troubled past by taking up a degree in Policing, Investigation and Criminology at the University of Cumbria.

Amazingly, despite leaving school a decade earlier she gained first-class honours, scoring 95 per cent in her dissertation.

The brainy student is now set to take on a Master’s degree in Criminology at the London School of Economics (LSE), one of the world’s best universities.

Ms Atkinson, from Lancaster, is now an activist for troubled teens and recently presented BBC3 documentary Banged Up and Left to Fail.

Ms Atkinson's academic success has capped off a remarkable turnaround in her life and she now believes 'anything is achievable'

The show highlights the plight of youngsters going through the criminal justice system and their lack of prospects.

On
 July 11, the inspirational graduate was crowned the National Union of 
Students (NUS) Endsleigh Student of the Year during a ceremony at 
Bolton’s Macron Football Stadium.

She said: 'It’s amazing and to be honest I am still in shock.

'I have gone from being a prolific offender living a chaotic lifestyle to living a settled and happy life, so if I can do it then anyone can.

'Looking back, if someone had said to me a few years ago that in 2014 you will be graduating with a first class honours degree, moving to London to commence a Master’s degree and looking forward to a successful career, I would have laughed, but this is my life.

'If you set your mind to it anything is achievable, but it is up to you to make the changes that need to be made.

'All you need to do is take little steps to begin with and you will see things changing. Everyone will have a different path to desistance, you just need to find yours.'

The BBC documentary Banged Up and Left To Fail sees Natalie attempt to tackle Britain’s re-offending problem.

In the hour-long programme she meets jailed young offenders while also liaising with  MP Jeremy Wright, Minister for Prisons.

Natalie added: 'Returning to education was one of the biggest challenges I had to overcome.

'When I first started University I was so nervous that I would not fit in, as I thought everyone would know I am an ex-offender and that I would not be able to do the work.'

University of Cumbria Student Union Chief Executive Daryl Ormerod commented: 'Natalie’s story is compelling, and her ongoing commitment to developing herself so that she may in turn help others as she has been helped, is simply inspiring.

'We are proud to have her amongst our membership, and wish her well for what I am sure will be a highly successful future.'
