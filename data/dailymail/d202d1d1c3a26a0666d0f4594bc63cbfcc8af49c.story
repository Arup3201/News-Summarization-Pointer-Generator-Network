Rugby fans are being ripped off by ticket touts charging up to £2,000 a ticket to watch Six Nations tournament matches.

Anonymous sellers are flogging their tickets via agencies for up to 35 times their original face value.

Two tickets behind the posts at Twickenham for England’s game against France in March are advertised by one firm called Get Me In for £1,650 apiece.

Chris Robshaw will be at Twickenham Stadium but genuine fans could miss out because of ticket touts

But the firm also charge a whopping processing fee of £610 on the tickets which originally cost £55 when they went to sale.

Meaning rugby fanatics will need to stump up a whopping £3,910 for a pair of tickets.

It’s a similar situation on Stubhub who are charging £1,041 for Wales’ opening clash against England in Cardiff next month.

Leigh Halfpenny will be keen to take to the Millenium Stadium pitch in front of an abundance of home fans

Fans interested in going to the World Cup final at Twickenham will have to fork out £3,449 if they want to buy their tickets with Viagogo.

The sites, which are totally legal, are designed to let fans buy tickets from other fans rather than touts.

But critics say more and more people are buying as many tickets as they possibly can to make a fast buck with expensive re-sales.

In reply, Viagago said: 'We have a wide range of prices on the site, starting from £59 (for Tonga vs Namibia), Scotland vs USA from £98, England vs Fiji from £117, England vs Australia from £249 and tickets for the Final starting from £564. 

'Sellers can list tickets at any price, but high prices rarely sell as they can be compared with others at lower prices. The reality is that around half the tickets sold on viagogo are priced at or below face value.'

Scotland's Ross Ford will be hoping to give fans something to cheer about during the Six Nations
