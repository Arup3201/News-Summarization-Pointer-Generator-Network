Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to line London's streets to cheer on Olympic champions including Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis at a victory parade to mark Team GB's spectacular achievements at the 2012 Games - and this map reveals the best spots to soak up all the atmosphere.

In all 700 British athletes will join a procession through the capital on Monday to celebrate Team GB's incredible medal haul in the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

Team GB finished third in the Olympics medal table with 29 golds, 17 silvers and 19 bronzes, while the Paralympic team currently lies second having already smashed its pre-Games target of 103 medals, thanks to breathtaking performances from the likes of swimmer Ellie Simmonds and sprinter Jonnie Peacock.

'Electric atmosphere': The victory parade will start at Mansion House at 1.30pm, snaking along Fleet Street, Aldwych and into The Strand by 2.30pm, before continuing on to Buckingham Palace by 3.30pm

The Greatest Team parade will see cycling stars Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton, triathlon gold medalist Alistair Brownlee, and Paralympic stars like Hannah Cockroft and Jody Cundy waving to the crowds from a convoy of 21 open-top floats.

The event is being touted as one of the greatest national celebrations in the capital in modern times, and organisers are expecting the turnout for the event to rival those for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympic torch relay.

Sports fans will be able to watch the parade as it travels along Queen Victoria Street and Cannon Street, passing St Paul's Cathedral, continuing along Fleet Street, past Aldwych and into The Strand, before reaching Trafalgar Square.

A big screen at the base of Nelson's Column will allow crowds to cheer on the athletes as the parade continues along the ticket-only part of the parade route, which will see the floats travel through Admiralty Arch, into The Mall and down to the Queen Victoria Memorial at Buckingham Palace.

With balmy temperatures forecast on Monday, Mayor Boris Johnson urged Londoners to turn out in force to pay tribute to Britain's Olympic and Paralympic heroes, and predicted an 'electric' atmosphere along the route from Mansion House to The Mall.

The parade, which kicks off 12 hours after the Paralympics closing ceremony, is also a thank you to British taxpayers who have contributed some Â£250 million to Team GB's effort.

The Mayor said: 'The atmosphere is going to be electric on this historic day, as our 2012 heroes take a well-earned break to celebrate their extraordinary achievements.

'This is also our moment to say a big thank you for giving us all a glorious summer of thrilling entertainment, so make sure you don't miss a moment of our Greatest Team Parade.'

The parade will begin at 1.30pm at Mansion House and travel along Queen Victoria Street and Cannon Street. The floats will pass St Paul's Cathedral and continue along Fleet Street, Aldwych and into Strand, reaching Trafalgar Square by around 2.30pm.

The athletes will then proceed through Admiralty Arch along The Mall, reaching the Queen Victoria Memorial by Buckingham Palace at about 3.30pm.

Team GB's athletes will be grouped in alphabetical order by their sport, with Olympic 5,000 and 10,000m winner Mo Farah on board the first float leading the procession.

Farah is expected to be followed by heptathlon gold medalist Jess Ennis, with long jump champion Greg Rutherford in the third.

Cyclists Sir Chris Hoy, Jason Kenny, Laura Trott and Victoria Pendleton will be in float seven, followed by double equestrian gold medal winner Charlotte Dujardin. rowing champion Katherine Grainger, sailor Ben Ainslie and triathlete Alistair Brownlee.

British Airways are to lead a spectacular flypast with the Red Arrows during the event, after obtaining special permission to fly over The Mall.

The Firefly A319 aircraft, which was used to bring the Olympic flame to the UK ahead of the start of the Games, will be emblazoned with a special thank you message on its underbelly.

During its 20-minute journey, it will pass over the Olympic Park at 3.40pm before reaching The Mall a minute later.

The parade will begin at 1.30pm at 
Mansion House and travel along Queen Victoria Street and Cannon Street. 
The floats will pass St Paul's Cathedral and continue along Fleet 
Street, Aldwych and into Strand, reaching Trafalgar Square by around 
2.30pm.

The athletes will then proceed 
through Admiralty Arch along The Mall, reaching the Queen Victoria 
Memorial by Buckingham Palace at about 3.30pm.

This latter area of the parade route will be reserved for groups who had made 'an invaluable contribution to the Games and the success of our athletes,' the Greater London Authority said.

This will include 14,000 volunteers, members of the blue light services, military personnel, coaches and support staff, friends and family of the athletes and schoolchildren from every London borough.

Most of Britain's 542-strong Olympic team and 289 member Paralympic team are expected to take part in the victory parade, with around 90 per cent of Britain's medal winners set to appear.

Organisers have warned there will be extensive road closures around the route of the parade.
