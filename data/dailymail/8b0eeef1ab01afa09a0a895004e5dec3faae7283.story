An 11-year-old with severe tinnitus is finally able to get a good night’s sleep after discovering listening to birds relieves his symptoms.

Leo Bamford has suffered from the condition - which leaves him with a constant high-pitched ringing in his ears - since he was a toddler.

Every night the noise kept him awake for hours and left him tired and groggy in the morning.

Leo Bamford (pictured with his mother, Antonella) has had tinnitus since he was a toddler and struggled to sleep because the ringing in his ears disturbed him

But scientists at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, in Cambridge, have developed a special birdsong box which drowns out the noise, helping Leo to finally get some rest.

His mother Antonella, 36, said since putting the recording in his bedroom Leo has become ‘a much happier little boy’.

She said: ‘When he was little Leo was very sensitive to loud or unusual noises, would wake frequently, crying in the night and he used to hold a pillow to his ear.

‘At first we thought it was an ear infection or something he’d eventually grow out of. But it just seemed to get worse as he got older.

recordings of birds singing. This gives his brain something other than 
the tinnitus to focus on meaning it is easier for him to sleep

‘Before the bird box, he would just 
lie in bed just listening to the screeching for hours on end. It’s so 
worrying as parents seeing your son like that.

‘But now he actually looks forward to going to bed, which was unheard of. It’s given him extra life.

Tinnitus is a term that describes any sound a person can hear from inside their body.

It is often described as a ringing in the ears but the sounds that can be heard include buzzing, humming, grinding and hissing.

Sometimes the sound beats in time with the person's pulse.

The condition can cause sleeping problems and depression but, in itself, it is not harmful.

The underlying cause is not known but it can be caused by earwax, an ear infection, stress, a head injury or exposure to loud noise.

There is no single cure for tinnitus but sometimes it can be addressed by treating the underlying cause - for example, through removing earwax build-ups.

Tinnitus is often worse in quite environments so some people benefit from listening to soothing sounds, such as the sound of the ocean.

The condition is most common in people over the age of 65 but it can affect people of all ages.

About 10 per cent of the population are thought to have the condition, though most have it mildly.

‘He’s got so much more energy and his schoolwork has really improved.

‘After using it, he was able to sleep through the night for the first time in 11 years.’

Leo, from Luton, Bedfordshire, was referred to Addenbrooke’s by his GP.

At the hospital he met hearing specialist Dr David Baguley who prescribed the sound box.

The device is a small box with a digital recording of common garden birds singing which Leo can play and control as he wants.

He has also been taught techniques to help manage the condition, like focusing on a particular sound so that his brain learns to ignore the tinnitus.

Leo said: ‘It’s very high pitched and it’s always the same noise. It’s very annoying but most of the time I ignore it.

‘But there’s no other sounds at night, so I used to just lie there listening to it.

‘Now I turn on my bird box and I can get to sleep. I don’t have to listen to the noise at night anymore - it really helps. I’m so happy it’s working.’

Tinnitus is the sensation of a sound in the ear, often a hissing, whooshing or ringing noise. There is no known cure for the condition.

It is not common in children, but experts are reporting a steady increase in the number of youngsters with the condition.

Medics still don’t know what causes tinnitus.

There are some contributing factors like
 ageing, earwax, respiratory and ear infections, exposure to loud noise 
and high blood pressure but the underlying cause is often unknown.

Leo (pictured with his mother, Antonella) says he has now had the first good nights' sleep of his life and his mother says his school work has improved dramatically as a result

Dr Baguley said: ‘A third of people I see have some hearing loss and tinnitus is strongly associated with that.

‘In another third of cases, the tinnitus appears to have started at a time of great stress, bereavement, redundancy, illness, or some other major life event.

‘In another third we don’t know the specific cause.’
