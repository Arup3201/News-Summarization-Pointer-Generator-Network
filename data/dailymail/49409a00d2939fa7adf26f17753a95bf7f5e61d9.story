As the saying goes - waste not, want not.

But Kelly Athena's obsession with scavenging for all of her food in bins and skips is driving her husband to the point of distraction.

For the past four years, Mrs Athena,  from Phoenix, Arizona, has been 'dumpster diving' to find ingredients for all of her meals.

Kelly Athena, from Phoenix, Arizona, has been dumpster diving for the past four years since learning about the practice in a documentary

Since then she's salvaged close of $125,000 worth of food from bins to stock her fridge, freezer and cupboard

She prepares meals for her family and friends with bin spoils, claiming the food 'tastes just fine'

She learned about the practice - which sees people pick through commercial bins outside shops, restaurants and supermarkets, for out of date food -  in a documentary.

Since then she's salvaged close of $125,000 worth of food from bins, even serving a meal made from supermarket spoils to friends at a dinner party.

Her husband, who refused to be named or have his face shown on TV, said he is embarrassed by her actions. 

He said: 'I'm in constant fear that the police will call me.'

Dumpster diving is not illegal in Arizona.

But many businesses could prosecute Mrs Athena, who disguises herself as staff using a selection of hats and aprons, for trespass if she was discovered onsite.

Despite this she refuses to stop and drives more than 30 miles a day to check out 20 different dumpsters for thrown out food.
