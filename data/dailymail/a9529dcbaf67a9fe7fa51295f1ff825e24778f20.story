A seven-year-old in North Carolina protected her family from a house fire not once but twice in one day.

Sage helped evacuate her family from their Winterville home after a fire started on Thursday evening, then alerted them again when the blaze reignited later that night. 

She first realized a grease fire that began on the stove around 6:30 p.m.

Under pressure: Seven-year-old Sage says, 'It's really fun to be a hero,' after evacuating her family from their burning home twice 

'I looked over when I heard the alarm and there was a fire on the stove,' she told WCTI.

Sage then led her family to safety, having practiced fire drills the day before. 

The family went back in after the blaze was under control, but the fire rekindled later on, leading Sage to ask her mother to unlock the door so she could go ask for help from the neighbors.

Though Sage led her family to safety, the house couldn't be saved the second time. 

Sage's grandfather Jack Weathersby had called the home his 'castle,' but he was hopeful about moving on without it.

'There's memories that were made in this home, but we can make some more,' Weathersby said.

Winterville Fire Chief Johnathan Heltzel said he was impressed by the young girl's readiness. 

His castle: Jack Weathersby, Sage's grandfather, called his home his castle, but said the family 'can make more' memories after the fire destroyed the home

Alert: A grease fire ignited the original blaze, which was later rekindled and led to the destruction of the home, which now cannot likely be salvaged

'Talk about true hero, the day before the fire started she learned about evacuation drills and the importance of being able to dial 911 and getting everybody outside the structure,' he said.

Asked how she felt after putting her emergency training to use, Sage said she could handle the burden of being a hero.

'It's really fun to be a hero,' she said.
