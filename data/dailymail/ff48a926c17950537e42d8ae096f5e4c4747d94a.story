FIFA president Sepp Blatter vowed at the IOC Congress in Monaco that he hasn’t seen the Michael Garcia World Cup bid corruption report which is causing so much controversy.

Blatter’s aides are claiming only six people have seen the full 430-page findings. They are ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert and his deputy Alan Sullivan, investigator Garcia and his No 2 Cornel Borbely, plus Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber and Domenico Scala, FIFA’s compliance chief.

However, such is Blatter’s control of world football’s ruling body that plenty of scepticism surrounds everything said on his behalf — especially when Garcia’s evidence of any wrongdoing during those murky 2018 and 2022 campaigns is of such importance to FIFA.

But Blatter — asked face to face by Sports Agenda during a break in the Congress to confirm what his Zurich advisors insisted was true — was adamant he had not been shown Garcia’s work. Blatter said: ‘I can confirm 100 per cent I have not seen the Garcia report. As I have said all along, the two ethics chambers act independently from FIFA.’

The FIFA farce continues with Zurich’s appeals committee due to hear Garcia’s complaint this week after he disowned Eckert’s summary conclusions as ‘materially incomplete’ and an ‘erroneous representations of the facts’.

BT Sport have bizarrely followed arch-rivals Sky in naming dressage champion Charlotte Dujardin  as their sportswoman of the year, despite the more obvious claims of Olympic skeleton gold medallist Lizzy Yarnold and Jo Pavey, who won the European Championship 10,000 metres aged 40. The BBC’s far more relevant Sports Personality vote will have the last say on Sunday about who is the top British sportswoman of 2014.

The ECB have named Russell Evans and Paul Baldwin as new first-class umpires for 2015 despite an upcoming ageism employment case.

Peter Willey and George Sharp have a tribunal date in February to contest being retired from the umpires roster against their wishes when in good health at the age of 65. 

The ECB say they took legal advice before publishing the umpire roster ahead of the tribunal.

Neville’s decision time

The FA and Sky remain remarkably relaxed about Gary Neville combining his coaching and pundit roles — despite his Dog & Duck v Red Lion comments about Manchester United and Liverpool this week once again highlighting the conflict around England players.

Neville is aware of the potential dangers, saying in his newspaper column: ‘I accept I am having my cake and eating it, with broadcasting and the England coaching role. 

'That will end. I know the decision is looming. I committed to Sky for four years and Roy Hodgson for four years and I’m not stupid enough to think I will combine those functions for ever.’

The most likely outcome is that Neville tries his hand as a club manager after Euro 2016.

There is considerable concern within grass-roots sport that the fall-out from Sport England’s botched Active People Survey will significantly affect budget plans for the financial year starting in April. Sports have been told by SE that the delay until January in receiving the amended APS figures, which are central to funding decisions, means the money handed out will not be announced until March 18, giving less than two weeks to put budgets in place. One chairman described the situation as a ‘complete shambles’.

Channel 4 insist there is no connection between the fact that their IMG-produced horseracing coverage has been so widely criticised, and Sunset & Vine alone winning the TV production tender for the Rio Paralympics when they did the London Paralympics in partnership with IMG. A C4 spokesman said the station’s remit was to share around independent contracts.
