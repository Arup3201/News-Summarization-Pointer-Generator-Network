A Romanian princess who hosted cockfights with her husband on their Oregon ranch has been revealed as the concession hostess who served tacos and beer while they pitted roosters against one another.Â 

Irina Walker, 60, and her husband John 
Wesley Walker, 67, are charged with hosting cockfighting derbies and illegal 
gambling at their ranch outside the small Morrow County town of Irrigon.

The Oregonian reports that an undercover informant filmed the action inside the illegal ring.

The widespread cockfighting organization has led to 31 arrests and the newly-unsealed court data shows that federal agents seized a stash of weapons and cash at the Walker's home.

Allegations: Irina Walker, 60, and her husband John Wesley Walker, 67, are charged with hosting cockfighting derbies and illegal gambling at their ranch outside the small Morrow County town of Irrigon

They found 24 firearms- including 
shotguns, pistols and rifles- that were spread throughout the property 
and hidden in bedrooms, offices, and laundry rooms.

The
couple also had 24 marijuana plants on their land. John Walker is 
reportedly a registered member of the state medicinal marijuana program,
but the quantity of 'massive' plants is cause for concern.

The
information was gathered by two informants who agreed to be paid for 
their spying services on the Walkers in return for lighter sentences in 
their pending cases.

One
informant participated in hopes of receiving American citizenship in 
spite of his previous felony burglary convictions, and another was 
previously deported but is looking for a pending drug trafficking 
conviction to be lessened.

The men reportedly attended some of the 22 cockfights arranged at the Oregon property that spanned 2.71 acres.

Cockfighting derbies were held at the Walker's ranch brought in as much as $2,000 a day.

Blades were attached to the birds' legs, spectators were charged admission, and food and drink were sold, the indictment said.

Unexpected history: Irina Walker, also known as Irina Kreuger, as a daughter of the last king of Romania

'(An
informant) observed John Walker monitoring everything around the derby 
and driving around, performing what the (informant) believed to be a 
security function,' special agent John Sherman told The Oregonian.

Twelve others from Oregon and 
Washington face lesser charges of conspiracy to violate the Animal 
Welfare Act through illegal animal fighting. They are to be arraigned in
Portland and Yakima, Wash.

'Cockfighting
is illegal under federal law and under the laws of all 50 states,' 
Amanda Marshall, U.S. attorney for Oregon, said in a statement.

The Oregonian newspaper identified Irina Walker, also known as Irina Kreuger, as a daughter of the last king of Romania.

Personnel records show John Wesley Walker was a Coos County sheriff's deputy from 1998 to 2003.

The four others charged with 
being part of the gambling business are Mario Perez, 62, of Hermiston; 
David Sanchez, 29, of Irrigon; Jose Luis Virgen Ramirez, 48, of 
Hermiston; and Aurelia Garcia Mendoza, 33, of Irrigon.

The exiled King Michael and Queen Anne of Romania attended the baptism of Princess Irina's daughter in Portland in 1987.

At the time, she and her first husband, John Kreuger, raised horses near the southern Oregon Coast.
