Grieving families who scatter the remains of their loved ones on Lake District fells are being urged to be more considerate following complaints about littering and ashes not being spread properly.

Piles of ashes has been found by ramblers as well cardboard boxes, according to park officials.

The environmental issue of spreading human and animal ashes has also been raised as it may have an effect on the biodiversity of the area.

Sign of respect: Mourners who scatter ashes in the Lake District are being urged to ensure that they clean up after themselves

Steve Curl, 60, and his wife Beth, of 
Underbarrow, stumbled upon a set of five discarded cardboard boxes at a 
popular beauty spot near a waymark cairn on the Langdale Pikes.

They were walking from Harrison Stickle to Pavey Ark when they discovered the boxes 'lying around'.

‘The
fact that friends and relatives of the deceased or pet owners should 
carry ashes to such high places, scatter them and simply leave the boxes
to litter the fells is completely incomprehensible,’ said Mr Curl.

‘I find the idea of scattering ashes a bit disconcerting but it was the rubbish that made us really angry.’

Most organisations allow ashes to be scattered across the Lake District but have encouraged mourners to act responsibly.

‘It can be upsetting to see large 
piles of ashes dotted around, so we would ask people to spread them 
around. It's about being sensitive but also responsible,’ said Steve 
Tatlock, ranger at the Lake District National Park Authority.

‘We
understand that families want to scatter ashes of relatives and pets in
places they enjoyed. However, it is important to pick up cardboard left
behind because it is littering.

Call for consideration: Park officials released their plea for proper conduct when scattering remains on the Lake District fells after ramblers discovered ashes and cardboard boxes left behind

Dr Malcolm Petyt, of the Ramblers Association, is concerned about the effect ashes could have on the environment.

‘The naturalists among us may say a concentrated amount in one place could have an effect on biodiversity in the area,’ he said.

Mike Innerdale, of the National Trust, added that mourners should be careful of contamination. ‘Avoid sensitive wildlife habitats like ponds and wet flushes and keep away from water courses.’

Alfred Wainwright, whose guide to the 214 Lake District peaks has gone down in history, had his ashes scattered on Haystacks after his death in 1991.

Derek Cockell, of the Wainwright Society, said he was 'dismayed' that containers had been discarded.

‘It is a landscape that many people have a close affinity with during their lifetime and they wish their ashes to be scattered on a favourite fell or viewpoint after their death,’ he said.

‘However, the Lake District landscape is a fragile environment and, as Wainwright stated, 'like a rare jewel it should be treasured and guarded'.’

Two of the containers were labelled Rossendale Pet Crematorium but manager Russell Grey said: ‘It would be inappropriate to comment until all the facts are known.’
