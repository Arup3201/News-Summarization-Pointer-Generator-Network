Long after the Toon Army had marched into town for a victory ale and the last few staff remained inside St James’ Park, one player partied by himself in the home dressing-room.

Not so long ago, the same young man would have been clearing that very room of muddied tape and empty bottles.

Not on Saturday afternoon. For Mehdi Abeid was king of the castle. There, having been delayed by demand for his post-match thoughts and four press interviews, the French-born Algerian turned the sound of his North African music to the max.

And why not? In the space of four days he had bossed two of the game’s greatest midfielders.

First, at Manchester City in the League Cup, he out-ran, out-passed and out-thought Yaya Toure in a shock 2-0 triumph. Then, against Liverpool and Steven Gerrard in front of a global television audience, he was named man-of-the-match on his Premier League debut in a 1-0 win for Newcastle.

The 22-year-old later posted two pictures on his Twitter account – one of him hunting down Gerrard and the other of a graphic detailing his seven tackles, more than any other player.

But there was no need for such reminders, millions had watched as the rookie ruled against the master and England’s Jordan Henderson.

There were 52,166 inside St James’. Two years ago, in front of just 2,500, Abeid was turning out for St Johnstone during a loan spell in the Scottish Premier League. Last season, though, he spent the entirety of the campaign in the Greek Super League with Panathinaikos.

Club sources, however, say that he travelled more than the 2,000 miles to Athens. Rather, he made the journey from boy to man.

Abeid, who now has a young son, has himself been fathered by the senior French players on Tyneside, Moussa Sissoko and Yoan Gouffran - and previously Yohan Cabaye - taking particular care with a comrade who left the eastern suburbs of Paris for the North-East of England aged just 18.

But the fledgling, it appears, is ready to take flight.

‘It has been unreal,’ he says. ‘To play against big sides like Manchester City and Liverpool in one week is fantastic. I am getting more and more experience and learning what it is like to play against big players.

‘But I have to keep my head down and work every day to prove that I can be a solution for the team and for the coach.

‘You don’t know how pleased I am – but I am not finished. I need to work every day and I want to judge myself against the big players.

‘I know that some days will be good and some bad, but I have been passionate and worked hard for four years – which have been difficult – but that is the way I work and play my football.’

His Greek odyssey was more than a mere learning curve, just ask Panathinaikos fans. They were desperate to see his loan stay made permanent after a return of 10 goals in 38 games, helping them to a third-placed finish and victory in the Greek Cup, their first in four years.

But reports of Abeid’s impact had way their way across the continent and into the possession of a somewhat surprised Alan Pardew, for the Newcastle manager had suspected it was time to move on the former Lens trainee.

‘I felt I grew a lot in Greece,’ says Abeid, offering explanation for his career revival. ‘I played 40 games and got a lot of experience. I grew up as a player and as a man – I want to keep going in that way.

‘I feel I’m a better player. I wanted to play football and that’s what I got. Now it’s about the next level and taking my chance.

‘The Premier League is the biggest in the world and to be part of it is great. It’s nice to be back and involved. I had a great season (at Panathinaikos) but now I need to build on that and show it here.’

On the evidence of the past week, it seems that Abeid boasts craft, graft, brains and bite – he was sent off at Crystal Palace in the League Cup Third Round and in his final league game for Panathinaikos – and has an eye for goal to boot.

Pardew feels the Algeria Under-23 international is a genuine all-rounder.

‘Mehdi has good strength, good discipline, is a good passer and has a good mentality,’ says the United boss, whose side have now won four on the bounce.

‘He has earned the right to play. Hopefully he could be one of the young players who can be a regular for us this season.’

Abeid certainly intends to stick around in the Newcastle first-team, for not even Toure or Gerrard can spoil his party right now.
