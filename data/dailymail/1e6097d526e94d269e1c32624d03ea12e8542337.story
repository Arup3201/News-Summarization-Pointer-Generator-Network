The high pay of BBC stars like Graham Norton, Gary Lineker, Jeremy Paxman, Tess Daly and Fiona Bruce will face fresh scrutiny after concerns salaries have 'got out of hand'.

The Corporation will today announce a 'value for money' review into its £200million annual bill for its most expensive on-screen 'talent' - the first for five years.

More than 250 staff earn more than £250,000 each year and 14 earn at least £500,000, but the BBC refuses to name them.

Stars: The pay of presenters like Graham Norton and Susanna Reid - whose salary has been quadrupled by ITV which tempted her to leave - is to be looked at by a new review at the BBC

It is understood that Graham Norton is paid £2.61million, Gary Lineker £1.5million, Jeremy Clarkson and Jeremy Paxman £1million, Fiona Bruce £500,000 and Tess Daly £250,000.

But the BBC says it must pay high salaries to keep its staff from leaving, especially after its star presenter Susanna Reid left after ITV reportedly quadrupled her salary,

Reid has apparently secured a £1million deal to present Good Morning Britain - far more than the £250,000 pay packet she was believed to be taking home on BBC Breakfast.

The BBC Trust will today announce that consultants will be brought in to decide whether the BBC offers better value for money since 2008 - and if it can find more savings.

It will also look into how much broadcasters are paid at rivals. 

MPs have welcomed the news with Tory Rob Wilson, Parliamentary Private Secretary to George Osbourne, saying: 'Pay at the BBC got completely out of hand, both for senior executives and its talent in recent years. It's about time a review took place'.

Many have been critical about pay at the BBC, especially after Jonathan Ross was offered a £6million annual deal before he left for ITV.

A BBC Trust spokesman said: 'Since we assessed talent pay five years ago, the BBC has successfully cut the amount it spends on its performers and presenters. But no market stays the same and it is time to look at this again.

'We are always seeking to balance saving money with ensuring the BBC has the range and quality of on-air and on-screen talent that audiences expect. This review will inform our work with the BBC and help ensure we have the right approach in place'.

Scrutiny: Gary Lineker and Jeremy Paxman are believed to earn £1m or more and consultants will consider whether this offers 'value for money'

However, in being asked to find ways to drive down costs, the BBC’s best-paid presenters have been in revolt against plans to axe their tax-saving freelance contracts.

The Corporation had promised the Government it would stop paying staff through ‘personal service companies’ that can attract a lower rate of tax.

But it may be forced to back down in the face of mounting anger from stars on the deals.

Jeremy Paxman, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis are all paid in this way.

Those
 whose freelance contracts are close to expiry have been asked to end 
their off-payroll arrangements to avoid suspicion of tax avoidance. But 
by signing on as a staff member – and qualifying for a BBC pension and 
other benefits – they would have to accept pay cuts of up to 25 per 
cent.

Instead of caving in 
to the demands, many have refused to sign staff contracts, leaving the 
BBC to consider either firing some of its biggest names or to accept 
defeat.

Earlier this year an insider to the 
negotiations described the situation as chaos, adding: ‘The BBC is in an
 impossible position. Its own staff have it over a barrel.

‘It
 has promised to change the way it pays its people, but is powerless to 
do anything because they would rather leave than give in and they are 
all acting as one. The bottom line is the BBC can’t afford to lose its 
top people.’

The personal service company arrangements have been 
branded ‘staggeringly inappropriate’ by the Commons public accounts 
committee, which suggested the BBC could be complicit in tax avoidance.
