Tom Cleverley had a scan on a badly bruised foot on Wednesday and is a doubt for Aston Villa’s match against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday — handing Paul Lambert a midfield injury headache.

The Villa boss will wait until the morning of the game to decide whether the 25-year-old can play, although his hand may be forced by the absence of Ashley Westwood and Fabian Delph.

Westwood is out for up to a month with a knee injury sustained in the win over Leicester and Delph is still recovering from a dislocated shoulder suffered in October.

Cleverley limped out of Sunday’s victory at Villa Park having struggled with his damaged foot throughout the match, and if he is unable to play against West Brom it would mean Lambert is without his entire first-choice midfield.

After beating Leicester 2-1, Lambert said: ‘Tom was touch and go before the game but the longer the game went on, the more he was feeling it.’

Meanwhile, Stoke City midfielder Charlie Adam — who has started just five times in the Premier League this season — is open to the possibility of a move abroad amid links to Real Sociedad, who are coached by David Moyes.

The 29-year-old insists he is no hurry to leave the Britannia Stadium but told the Stoke Sentinel: ‘There’s better weather than here. I would love the experience of playing abroad because it’s certainly something different.’
