Broken plastic: Nestle's Kit Kat Chunky Giant Eggs are one of the affected batch from the factory accident

Nestle has withdrawn ‘tens of thousands’ of chocolate bars and Easter eggs from sale after people complained of finding plastic in the sweets - just one week before Good Friday.

The Kit Kat Chunky Collection Giant Egg and the Chunky Choc Fudge, Caramel, Peanut Butter and Hazelnut bars were recalled on Friday.

Seven people in the UK complained of finding plastic, had broken off a mould in the Bulgarian factory where the sweets are made, in their chocolate.

Spokesman Odette Forbes said: ‘This is a precautionary measure.'

It’s only items with certain best before dates, and if you buy one of the bars or an egg from a shop now, it will be from an unaffected batch.’

Nestle said no one had been taken ill as a result of the plastic pieces.

It admitted 'tens of thousands' of items were affected, but said that they only represented a 'small number' of the overall product.

The choc fudge and hazelnut bars with a best before date of between September and October 2013, the caramel bars with a best before date of either June or July 2013 and the peanut butter bars with the best before date of between September 2013 and February 2014 are all subject to the recall.

Eggs with the best before date on July 2013, hazelnut multipacks with a best before date of between September and December 2013 and choc fudge multipacks with a best before date of between October and December 2013 are also affected.

Ms Forbes said: ‘Most of our products are not affected, so our normal Chunky bars and the mint ones haven’t been recalled, nor have our regular Kit Kats.’

Precautionary: Nestle said that any chocolate bought from now on will be from an unaffected batch

People who have bought the affected items are being advised not to eat them, but instead to send them back to Nestle for a refund.

The company also apologised to its customers in a statement.

It said: ‘The safety and quality of our products are non-negotiable priorities for the company.

We sincerely apologize to our consumers for any inconvenience caused by this voluntary recall.’

Bars and eggs sold in Germany, Austria, Singapore, Malta, Switzerland, The Philippines and Canada have also been withdrawn.
