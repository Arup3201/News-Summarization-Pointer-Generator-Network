The price of your morning latte, espresso or skinny caramel macchiato with an extra shot could be about to soar due to a killer fungus that is ravaging coffee harvests across Latin America.

Coffee rust, or roya, is a yellow and orange-colored fungus that has devastated coffee fields from Mexico to Peru over the past two years, causing more than $1 billion in damage across the region.

Its damage has become so severe that the U.S. government has launched a $5million drive to help farmers in the worst-hit regions in a desperate bid to save the industry and keep coffee cheap.

But aside from fears over the cost of a cappuccino on the American high street, the real concern is for the thousands of small, family-run farms whose livelihoods hang in the balance after watching entire crops be devoured by the disease.

Especially hard hit have been Central America's arabica coffee plants, which produce high-quality beans used in espressos and gourmet specialty blends that are in growing demand in the United States and elsewhere around the world.

Prices for arabica coffee jumped to a two-year high in the futures market earlier this month, thanks in part to a severe drought in Brazil.

'We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,' said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development.

On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&M University's World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus.

Aside from fears for the price of a cappuccino on the American high street,
 expert's chief concern is for the economic security of the mostly 
small, family-run farms in South America. If farmers lose their jobs, it
 increases hunger and poverty in the region and contributes to violence 
and drug trafficking.

Washington
 estimates that production could drop anywhere from 15 to 40 per cent in
 coming years, and that those losses could mean as many as 500,000 
people could lose their jobs.

Though some countries have brought the fungus under control, many of the poorer coffee-producing countries in Latin America don't see the rust problem getting better anytime soon.

Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Costa Rica have all been hard hit.

Much
 of the blander, mass-produced coffee in this country comes from Asia 
and other regions. Most of the richer, more expensive coffees are from 
small, high altitude farms in Central America.

Because the farms are 
smaller, farmers there often don't have enough money to buy the 
fungicides needed or lack the training to plant in ways that could avoid
 contamination.

The rust, called roya in Spanish, is a fungus that is highly contagious due to airborne fungal spores. It affects different varieties, but the Arabica beans are especially susceptible. Rainy weather worsens the problem.

'We don't see an end in sight anytime soon,' said Leonardo Lombardini of Texas A&M's World Coffee Research.

So far, major U.S. coffee companies have been able to find enough supply to avoid price increases. But some smaller outfits already have seen higher prices, said Ric Rhinehart of the Specialty Coffee Association of America.

Rhinehart said the worst-case scenario is that consumers eventually will pay 'extraordinarily high prices for those coffees, if you can find them at all.'

He said some very specialized varieties from a single origin - Guatemalan antigua coffees, for example - have been much harder to source. If the problem continues, he says, some small coffee companies either will raise prices or use blends that are easier to find, decreasing the quality of the coffee.

Larger companies such as Starbucks and Keurig Green Mountain Inc. have multiple suppliers across the region and say they have so far been able to source enough coffee.

'It's a little bit too soon to tell what the impact will be on supply and long term quality over time,' said Lindsey Bolger, who heads up coffee sourcing for Keurig Green Mountain.

Still, the companies are trying to ensure that their future supply isn't affected, so they are working closely with growers on better practices that will help them avoid contamination.

'Supporting the farmer's ability to access information, technology and resources allows them to adapt to these uncertainties and ensures the longevity of our industry's supply chain,' said Craig Russell, Starbucks Global Coffee executive vice president. Starbucks even bought a Costa Rican farm for research purposes.

USAID intends to work with Texas A&M to step up research on rust-resistant coffee varieties and help Latin America better monitor and respond to the fungus. The U.S. already collaborates with some of the coffee companies and other international organizations to finance replanting of different varieties of trees.

The effort is part of the Obama administration's Feed the Future program, which aims to rid the world of extreme poverty through agricultural development and improved nutrition.

While the effort has helped hungry children around the globe, 'we're at risk of backtracking because of coffee rust,' Shah says.
