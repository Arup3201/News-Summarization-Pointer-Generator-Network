James Ward knows that the dividends will come from the weeks he has been spending with the buddy he describes as ‘The Beast’.

The friend in question is Andy Murray, his host and training partner last month in Miami, where they worked themselves into a stupor before Christmas to prepare for a new season which should see them spend more time together.

That is because Ward’s steadily-climbing ranking should mean he gets into some of the tournaments Murray takes for granted, such as the Australian Open, which begins on Monday.

Andy Murray's gruelling training regime is paying dividends as he prepares for the Australian Open

Murray goes into the first grand slam of the year in great shape after putting in the hard graft

The 27-year-old Londoner, now on the cusp of the world’s top 100, further illustrated that he belongs there with a 3-6, 7-6, 6-2 victory over American No 1 John Isner in the Kooyong Classic.

True, it was only an exhibition but to defuse the giant’s serve when he is tuning up for the year’s first Grand Slam is a good effort all the same, and an early payback for the toiling in Florida.

‘Andy is a beast, everyone knows that, and he might disagree but I kept up with him, we were pushing each other,’ said Ward, who spent two-and-a-half weeks as Murray’s house guest, before hooking up with him again in the Middle East after Christmas. ‘It was hard but you don’t have doubts because you know you have done the work with one of the best in the world.’

Ward outlined the kind of regime they endured in a place where most go for hedonistic pleasure, not brutal training punishment.

‘Every other day we would play for about three-and-a-half hours, like in a Grand Slam. On the other days it would be more like two hours on court and then every day it’s up to two hours in the gym.’

There would also be sessions on the beach, no recliners necessary. ‘We did sand work, mainly short repeated sprints when you’d compete against each other. At the end of most days you are dead... in bed by 10 o’clock.

‘I was looked after really well by his team. I am a lot stronger and moving better than before.’

This is the sort of regime that sees Murray turn up every year in Australia in prime shape, and his reversion to sand training looks to be a change under his new structure working full-time with trainer Matt Little.

Murray has been gearing up for the Australian Open under the watchful eye of coach Amelie Mauresmo

Murray’s future father-in-law, the experienced coach Nigel Sears, revealed earlier this month that his resting heart beat was a phenomenally low 37 beats per minute. The former Wimbledon champion has been working on his already lightning foot-speed, spending slightly more time on the court and less in the gym.

He and Ward have become close since becoming a regular duo in the British Davis Cup team and although they have largely inhabited different tennis worlds Murray has taken a close interest in his rise up the rankings.

‘Andy is always the first to say well done when I’ve had a decent win,’ said Ward. ‘I was flagging a bit at the end of last season and he helped keep me going.’

They have a shared interest in Arsenal, for whom Ward, who grew up in Euston, dreamed of playing as a child. While Britain’s No 2 has an unusual sports clothing deal with men’s outfitter Ted Baker, Murray has a more lucrative tie-in with Under Armour. ‘The only bad thing about him is that he is sharing his clothing supplier with Tottenham,’ added Ward.

Ward has made a steady rise up the rankings and is on the cusp of the world's top 100

British youngsters Kyle Edmund and Liam Broady moved to within one match of qualifying for the main draw of a Grand Slam for the first time when they made the third round of the Australian Open qualifying event.

Edmund, the 20-year-old from Yorkshire, came back to beat American left-hander Austin Krajicek 4-6, 7-6, 6-2 and now faces a winnable clash with world No 323 Dane Propoggia of Australia.

Broady fought out a fine 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 win over another American, 18-year-old Jared Donaldson, a superb ball-striker reckoned to be one of the sport’s hottest prospects. It was a match of supremely high quality for the qualifying event on the most remote outside court, and his reward is to meet American veteran Michael Russell.

Heather Watson’s encouraging form continued when she made her second semi-final on the main WTA Tour by defeating Italy’s Roberta Vinci 7-6, 6-2 in the Hobart International.
