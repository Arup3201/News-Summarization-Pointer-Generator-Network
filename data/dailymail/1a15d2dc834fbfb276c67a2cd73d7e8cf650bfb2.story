A book shop has come up with a novel way to sell second-hand books - by dispensing them at random from a vintage vending machine.

In exchange for a $2 coin, the ‘Biblio-Mat’ gives curious book lovers a novel picked at random at quirky bookstore the Monkey’s Paw in Toronto, Canada.

The creative invention holds books that are at least 25-years-old and has proved popular among customers who are left 'amused and mystified' by their purchase surprise.

Store owner Stephen Fowler, 48, said: ‘Most people laugh when they first see it and they're surprised by the intense mechanical sound that it makes.

‘The Biblio-Mat is the ultimate expression of the serendipity that people experience in a second-hand bookshop.

‘You might like what you get, or you might not; but for a two-dollar coin, it's a pretty cheap thrill.

‘In our shop, we always try to startle 
browsers with the oddest and most unexpected variety of old books so the
 idea of a book randomiser was a natural extension of the store's 
philosophy.’

It all started when Mr Fowler had to come up with a clever merchandising ploy for a community sidewalk sale.

He had suggested a cardboard box hiding an assistant handing out books through a flap but his friend and professional designer Craig Small shunned the idea.

Mr Small envisioned the machine and took three months to have it ready in time for the community sale in late October.

The machine has proved popular and since the sale, some 60 people each weekend been buying random books from the novel invention.

Mr Fowler said: ‘Sometimes people laugh when the see the title they've received or just look mystified.

‘If a person knew exactly what book he was looking for, he'd be better off ordering it on Amazon.

‘To begin with I was just going to call it the Book Randomiser but my wife convinced me to call it something a bit more quaint which is why we ended up calling it Biblio-Mat.’
