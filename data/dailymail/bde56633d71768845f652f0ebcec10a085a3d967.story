Today  800 mourners - wearing purple 
which was the teenager's favourite colour - packed Birmingham Cathedral 
to say farewell to her

Eerily just weeks before her death the popular schoolgirl had told friends on social media of her fears after an earlier incident, tweeting:

'This man is worrying me on the bus, keeps getting up and walking up and down stairs, and sitting in different place :|"

Today  800 mourners - wearing purple which was the teenager's favourite colour - packed Birmingham Cathedral to say farewell to her.

Around 200 well-wishers, who were unable to get inside the church, braved the freezing conditions to listen to the proceedings outside via a tannoy system.

Her devastated parents Jason and Kathleen Edkins wrote on a card next to her coffin: "Our beautiful princess Christina, we will always miss you and you will live in our hearts forever, mummy and daddy xxx.'

The couple, who encouraged Christina to attend a school out of Birmingham so she could get a better education and pursue her dream of being a nurse, also wrote a poem to their daughter which was read out.

Her devastated parents Jason and Kathleen
Edkins wrote on a card next to her coffin: 'Our beautiful princess 
Christina, we will always miss you and you will live in our hearts 
forever, mummy and daddy xxx.'

It read: "We love u (sic) more than anything, more than words can say, you meant the world to us, bringing happiness every day.

'A daughter and sister, always in our heart, you will stay with us forever, even though we have to part.

'A beautiful teenager, a princess through and through, even if u (sic) are not here, our thoughts will always be of you."

Paying tribute to Christina, her cousin Stephen Newby said: "Today we will say goodbye to Christina.

'We are devastated that she should have been taken away so senselessly and continue to try to come to terms with what has happened.

A card left by Christina's parents in which they said: 'You will live in our hearts forever'

'We have been overwhelmed and comforted by the spontaneous reactions of so many people.

'While many of them never knew Christina, all have been touched in some way by this tragic event and share in our grief.

'We would like to thank everybody for their support and kindness, in particular the local groups, whose efforts have been so meaningful to us.

'The determination and support of the police has been invaluable during this very difficult time and we wish to thank all of the officers involved.

'We hope that justice will now be done and that Christina can be allowed to rest peacefully."

Neil Shaw, headteacher of Leasowes High School in Halesowen, West Mids., closed the school to allow her classmates to attend the service.

Breaking down in tears in front of the congregation, he said: "If schools could choose students they would all be like Christina.

'She was an enthusiastic member of the school netball team and as a sport leader helped to inspire others and support them.

Christina's pure white coffin was adorned with purple and white flowers which arrived at the cathedral by horse-drawn carriage

'She was a shining beacon of all that is good in young people. Staff will cherish the time we spent with Christina."

Christina's pure white coffin was adorned with purple and white flowers which arrived at the cathedral by horse-drawn carriage.

Five pallbearers carried her coffin into the cathedral while the song 'One Thing' by the teenager's favourite band One Direction was played.

Before the service Dean of Birmingham Very Revd Catherine Ogle said: "We extend heart-felt sympathy and prayers to her family and friends.

'This death is very hard to bear and we ask all those who mourn the loss of this lovely and bright young woman to join us in prayer.

'Birmingham Cathedral stands in the centre of the city as a symbol of the triumph of peace, hope and love and these are the values that really matter at times like these."

Philip Simelane, 22, from Walsall, West Mids., was remanded in custody after appearing in court charged with Christina's murder. He is next due to appear in court at the end of May.
