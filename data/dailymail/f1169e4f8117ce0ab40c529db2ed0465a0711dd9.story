Cooking for guests is always a nerve-racking experience, so spare a thought for the schoolboy who was handed the task of whipping up ice cream fit for a royal countess.

Luckily for the junior chef in question, the royal was Sophie Wessex and the cone was made using easy-to-handle paper instead of sugar and cream.

And it certainly seemed to go down well with the Countess, who beamed as she accepted the cone during a tour of the Gatten and Lake Primary School while on a visit to the Isle of Wight.

Can I eat this? Sophie looks ready to tuck in but unfortunately for the Countess, this treat is made of paper

The Countess, whose last appearance was an emotional visit to the Surrey hospital where she gave birth to both of her children, looked on fine form as she was shown around the school and crouched down to get a closer look at the projects on display.

Ever the style maven, the Countess was chic in a cream pencil skirt which she teamed with a tailored black jacket that showed off her svelte figure.

After inspecting the school's project, Shanklin Our Town, the Countess was shown artwork created by pupils and was treated to a song about the town.

Gatten and Lake schoolchildren were joined for the day by others from the nearby St George's School and St Catherine's School, all of whom have recently achieved their Duke of Edinburgh's Bronze Award.

All smiles: The Countess crouched down as she chatted to a smiling little girl and a rather bashful young boy

Elegant: For the tour, Sophie plumped for a chic white skirt worn with a neat, fitted black jacket

Pleased: The Countess appeared to be thrilled with the posy of seasonal flowers handed to her by a pupil

The Duke of Edinburgh scheme, which is open to children and young people between the ages of 14 and 24, is a project close to the Countess of Wessex' heart, and she and husband Prince Edward, recently toured the Caribbean to promote the international version of the award.

After accepting a posy packed with seasonal hyacinths from a six-year-old pupil, the Countess was whisked off to visit ethical fashion label Rapanui at their headquarters in nearby Sandown Bay.

There she met the company's two new apprentices as well as founders Rob Drake-Knight and Martin Drake-Knight, who gave her a tour of the premises.

The company specialises in organic casualwear, all of which is manufactured in ethically-approved factories powered by wind and solar power.
